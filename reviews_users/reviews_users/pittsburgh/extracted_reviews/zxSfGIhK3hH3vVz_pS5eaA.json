They had four people working that night with only a few tables, and all they did was stand around cleaning silverware and cups. They only filled up our waters once they heard one of us complain. They were not coordinated at all as when one person brought us plates, another removed them only to bring us different plates.  One of our orders were also messed up. We ordered butter chicken and received shrimp in some sauce. They said it was definitely chicken, but we could tell that it was most indeed shrimp. Lastly, I saw that they offered a 10% discount upon check in on yelp, but they denied it because, \"there's no button for it\". Was really not what I was expecting at all.",

    "text": "I recently returned in a simular situation as my last visit. The wait staff were, again, attentive, and three dishes were placed on each table. However, I was not as impressed by their food this time.  We started off with the pappadom as an appetizer. Although it had a heavy herb taste, it was also very salty. The chutneys alleviated this somewhat, but I still wasn't a fan. Then, we had chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, tarka daal, and chana masala served with naan and rice.   My first impression of the chicken tandoori was, again, salty. The chicken itself was well-cooked, and it would've been great with a bit less salt. I found the other three dishes okay, but the chana masala was the only one with any distinctive taste, and even that was mostly spiciness. (Thankfully, it was at a level well within my tolerance.) I didn't find any of them to be great, though. The naan was delicious, as was the rice, which seemed to have another light flavor from herbs or something.   For dessert, we finished off with kheer, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Overall, it's a nice, cozy restaurant, but I think there are better Indian restaurants in the area.",

Props to new management for that.   We ordered our usual few dishes we always order at Indian restaurants. Nothing was out of the ordinary, the garlic naan was really good though. Tasty, but small-ish portions. Biggest gripe is the price. In my opinion, the food tastes similar to Star of India, but it was significantly higher priced. For what? the upscale decor? Meh. 2 samosas for like $5.. why??? (Go get super cheap samosas across the street instead)  Waiter was super attentive though, water glass never went past the middle, and we were asked multiple times of how we were doing/how the food is.   All in all, I really can't justify the price for the food.",

    "text": "A new Indian place in my work-'hood? Of course I had to go check it out!  Yuva India is in the same location as the now defunct Star of India. I do not know any of the details about the change of hands, but the restaurant space was closed for about a month for remodeling and Yuva India had their soft opening sometime this past week.  Regarding taste, the food was alright. When trying a new Indian restaurant, I look to one of two dishes that are common in restaurants to find out about their cooking: mattar paneer (mattar are English peas, paneer is a soft, mild flavored cheese, in a tomato sauce) OR malai kofta (a vegetable croquette made with ground veggies like carrots and potatoes and peas, sometimes with paneer, golden raisins, or cashews. These sit in a cream sauce that is either with a tomato base or an onion/butter base). The mattar paneer was good. The tomato sauce tasted fresher that what I've found elsewhere and had more tomato chunks than is usual. Pretty good, though the small serving of rice isn't enough for the amount of sauce. The potato cutlet was also pretty good; I would suggest it IF it is the kind of thing you are apt to like.  I'm feeling list-y, so let's go with that:  PROS: +Clean, contemporary, and updated dining room. Bright warm colors on the walls with large photographs hung around and new laminate flooring. Feels spiffy. +Courteous and pleasant wait staff. Very attentive. The service didn't feel like you were at a place in their first week of soft opening. +They have chaat and poori on the menu. I don't see that much around PGH, so if you like those, you can find them here. If you've never heard of it, I can't give a full definition but to say they fall into a savory snack category and frequently have puffed rice or toasted vermicelli topped with things like chutneys or yogurt. Not my thing, but it may be yours.  CONS: -Price. Expect to pay a few bucks more (for almost all items) than you typically pay at other Indian places. It adds up. Tea ($4) , mattar paneer ($12) and a potato cutlet ($4.50) were $22 after taxes. That's high for Pittsburgh prices and for a casual Indian restaurant.  -They don't make their masala chai. So, $4 for a 6 oz. cup of hot water and a chai tea bag seems crazy to me. No refill, by the way.  GOOD TO KNOW: The heat scale is mild-medium-& hot. Medium here is about a 6-7 elsewhere, so they skew on the hot side. If you usually get medium and that is pressing your limits, it will likely be too hot for you here.  For me, this place will not be on my regular rotation of Indian joints I frequent unless their pricing changes. However, the food is decent, the atmosphere is nice, and the service is good. It is certainly worth a try if you are in the neighborhood to see for yourself.",

She complete lost it with us, went totally crazy and said we've been here for 34 years.  When we explained that we ordered mild not spicy she gave us the \"talk to the hand\" signal and began to rant at us. The waiter brought the dish back and said you might as well eat it because you're paying for it. I don't think so! I can't imagine how they have remained in business for so long.  The other dish was moderately OK, and we asked for a little salad, but he made a giant salad and charged an entire price. The food was NOT good and the attitude was completely unacceptable.",

I did like what I had, too.  I ate once or twice at the former Star of India, and Yuva is much better in terms of decor, and possibly even food (I can't remember the old menu, maybe it is really the same and it could even be the same cook in the kitchen for all I know).  Props for the great service - the waitress was willing to split checks for a large party, and the food came out promptly and together, which was impressive.  However, we are lucky in Pittsburgh to have other Indian restaurants that are really very good -- like Udipi and the India Gardens.  Yuva isn't even in the same league, which is why I'm giving it only two stars.",

While I do like other Indian restaurants in the area, I thought the flavor at Yuva was superior.  You can actually taste the spices, the food wasn't swimming in oil and the naan had a crisp bottom (sometimes at other places you end up with a greasy, bland entree and soggy bread).",

This was the grand opening and the staff was very pleasant.  I believe it was the owner that waited on us and she was very sweet and helped us make selections.  We told her we couldn't handle spice...but people don't realize just how baby-ish we really are about it.  So when they say, it's a 3 out of 10 (like the dish I ordered)...it's still spicy to me.  That being said I actually really liked the flavor of my dish.  I apologize for not remembering the entire name, but it was something chicken/masala/spinach.  My boyfriend got something lamb/josh.  His was spicier than mine ( a 4 out of 10 on their scale).  I could see the looks of pity from the staff as we downed glass after glass of water (even asking for a pitcher to be left at the table...)  I don't want to scare people away!  My food was really good and I ate it all, it just had kick, which normal people seem to enjoy.    The decor is very soothing and the space is modern.  I really liked the color palette.  I really want to like this place, but I think Indian food, in general, may not be for me.  I gave this 4 stars because, even though I don't like spice, it could be worth checking out if you do.",

I had a discount coupon from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> for $15 off a minimum purchase of $22.50, so my friend and I came for lunch.   I eat vegan, so I was happy to see clear markings for anyone vegan, gluten-free, or vegetarian. The best option for me was the Vegetarian Lunch, which offers salad, rice, a side of Tarka Daal,  and a side of Chana Masala, which for some reason isn't vegan here. I asked if I could have two Daals instead, but was not allowed, unless I changed to the more expensive \"Pick any two sides and one naan\" special, but naan is not vegan either. So my friend ordered the Yuva Lunch, I ordered the Vegetarian Lunch anyway (I gave the chana to my friend), and we ordered masala fries to share, to spend the minimum for the coupon, which I presented to our server at that time.  My friend's meal seemed good, my meal was kinda just okay. The salad and rice were okay, the daal was not great (very soupy and bland), and the portions were smaller than I expected. The fries were good but pretty silly: basically a small order of McDonald's fries with a little spice rubbed on, and a big side of ketchup. I thought that I would have felt ripped off, if I was paying full-price.  After our meal we handed our coupon over, our waiter disappeared, and then brought it back, saying it was only good for use at dinner. I was confused since I had read the coupon over and checked with our waiter beforehand, so I asked to see where on the coupon it mentioned this, but he insisted it was no good. I didn't want to trouble them anymore, so we just paid the full amount.   Good thing <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> allows you to exchange unused coupons for credit elsewhere, because it was not really worth it that time or to go back.",

I didnt try the sweet chutney, but my family liked it, I thought the mint chutney was very good. not runny, thick consistency and flavorful.  The food was very good. I thought the papadoms were fantastic, the korma was also very good. meat could have been a little more tender, but was not tough. Might have used a bit more spice to it, but the achar made up for that.  The Tikka was also very good as were the raitha and naan. I can't really complain. If I had a small nit to pick it would be that I would like a little more spice and perhaps the meat a little more tender. Next time I will order some vegetarian dishes to try. Maybe I will see if they have aloo gobi and some dal or palak paneer.",

The interior was gorgeous with the nice upholstery and pictures on the wall and the ambiance is perfect for a cloudy fall day in the Burgh. The cleanliness is great considering the stereotype that Indian restaurants are grimy.  As for the food, I thought it was above average for each of my visits and the lunch specials are good but a bit too high based on the amount of food.   The service was average- the food came out pretty slow but the attentiveness of the waiters helped to make up for that.   Overall a nice place to have lunch before perusing the Carnegie Museums across the street.",

You could tell she was genuinely happy to be there (which in my experience is uncommon).  The service was fast and well-timed! She knew exactly when to stop by to see if we were ready to order.   The meal was excellent!  Very nicely presented! I got the spice lunch and enjoyed it very much. I'm so glad naan bread already comes with it instead of being extra (I LOVE naan bread, I'm pretty sure I have an addiction).  I had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate with me and when the hostess noticed it she came over and happily enquired if I would like to use it. FINALLY! A restaurant establishment that doesn't make me feel like a bad person for having a coupon!    Final Thought:  Great atmosphere, fantastic service, delicious food.  I recommended this place to all!",

So why the 3 stars? The service is remarkably bad. Allow me to explain; it's not that the servers are douches or anything like that. In fact, they are pretty nice. But the timing out of the kitchen is really really bad. Both times that I have been here, we have waited for our food for an hour. Now, to be fair, the food is good enough that we were willing to wait, but at no time did someone come out and warn us how long it was going to take, or even apologize to us about the wait.   I think they have their act together for lunch - my guess is that they have a bunch of stuff already prepped in back for that time period. But for dinner? Hit or miss in terms of timing. We saw other tables of two have their orders taken and food brought out and be done with their meal before we ever saw any action at our table. So, maybe the secret is to come in party sizes less than four. Whatever the secret is, just be forewarned: don't come here if you have somewhere you need to be in a hurry afterwards.",

She said she hadn't heard of any such coupon deal for her restaurant (which by the way I have been seeing on Yuva eatery page on yelp for the last 1 year!) She said first of all she did a favor on us by accepting this weird coupon but now she wants us to tip at least 20% or more to the staff!!!! She started arguing vehemently at the dinner table in front of other customers and staff and shouting!! She kept embarrassing us and  never stopped shouting!! I did not know what to do. I wanted to run away as she did not even let me explain or talk at all. The food was just average with very small portions.  I complained to Yelp about the situation and they were very co operative and refunded our money. I am never going back again. Horrible experience.",

Meanwhile.....all this time.....still not one persons asks if we want more drinks!!! This is Restaurant 101 people.  I'm still in disbelief of the poor experience we had there.",

    "text": "Had a great meal at Yuva with excellent, friendly, attentive service. And they serve alcohol here! That's awesome as Indian restaurants never serve alcohol!  I've eaten at 10+ different Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh (some no longer with us, RIP Mirchi which was amazing), and this was the best korma I've had in a while (since Mirchi closed). Super flavorful and the goat was excellent. I love that they give you a salad on the side! It's a great palate cleanser with all of the spicy food. (We like it hot).   The portions were plenty. I think the way that they serve the food and the bowl might give people the impression that they are getting less than other Indian restaurants, but it's a deep bowl. I was stuffed and kept trying to eat more and just finished my leftovers (next day). I'm at home so I'm allowed to lick the bowl --and I did.   My sig other had the lamb vindaloo. I kept going for his with my naan too! Very good. He was able to finish his meal (dude can put away some food), but was threatening not being able to walk home afterwards.   Needless to say, the portions are a-plenty.   We also had a stuffed pepper appetizer that was good, but the dinners were the star. The mango lassi was tasty. I had a nice glass of wine (large wine portion too).   Expensive? We ordered the two most expensive dinners with the most expensive meats and that was $31. We ordered appetizer, drinks (1 alcohol), dinners, 2 orders of naan and got to the $60s which is what we spend everywhere when we order the same. So no, the price was not unreasonable.   The different approach to the menu doesn't really make the menu that much smaller. It just lists everything more efficiently. They have tandori, tikka masala, korma, vindalo, aloo gobi, naan, biryani, dahl, etc. It's just listed in a way that makes a more efficient use of space. It's really the kind of Indian restaurant that you can take a non-indian food lover to and they can safely order something that they will enjoy while you still can enjoy a spicy flavor 'splosion.  We live in the burbs, so we aren't in Oakland often, but the next time we are I know that I'm going here. Sorry Lulus.",

The waiter never brought us water, and reminded us every 10 minutes while we were eating of the closing time. Additionally, the food was very watery and hardly had flavor. Being rushed by the waiter plus the unsatisfying food made this a poor experience. You'll have a better experience at any other Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.",

We ordered the samosa and garlic nan.  I was going to order another appetizer, but the waiter said that you couldn't choose the spicyness of the appetizer.  He then explained that you are able to pick the spiceyness of the main dish.  This leads me to believe that the appetizer is pre-made and not made to order.  As someone from this region I am utterly sick of this kind of approach.  You are in the hospitality industry, bend to the wim of the customer!  The samosa's came rather quickly and there was 2 of them.  So, that means I got to eat one samosa and Elisabeth got to eat one samosa.  Would you even call that an appetizer?  Our dishes came out and they were not tiny, but not that great of a portion size.  Although you do get a salad with the small bowl of food and some basmati rice was it, maybe?  I am glad that we ordered nan and the appetizer because I would have ended up very hungry.  I like that they are trying new spins on Indian food, but there was nothing that really excited me and made me want to come back.  I did try some of Elisabeth's dal makni.  I have never had black lentils before so that sparked my interest, but it tasted like a dull combination of chili and soup.  The service was speedy, but the staff is like their food very unexciting.  Oh and I was going to order alo gobi and the lion stout originally, but there were out of both  :(  P.S. - the website makes it seem as though there is a bar an area to hang out in, but there is no such thing.  The bar is basically the check out counter, it is very small.  I would hardly call it an actual bar.  You can order from like 7 choices of beer that come in bottles, no taps whatsoever.    It reminds me of what India garden when it was on Atwood would have, King Fisher, Lion, Sam Adams...etc.",

They have some of the best tadka daal and I LOVE it (don't tell my mother in law). It's not a typical Indian lunch as they serve it with a fresh salad as well and in cute little bowls on your plate. It's good though perhaps a bit overpriced.  However, I work for a non-profit and when trying to use my purchasing card for a business meal they refused to refund the tax charged (we are tax exempt). This to me seems like bad business practices and hence why I will not give them 4 stars, only 3.",

    "text": "So, I came back here and went with the suggestion that the waiter gave me last time, which was to just order the goat curry from the dinner menu even though it was lunch time. I did just that, and asked for it to be medium spicy.  Needless to say, it was one of the best goat curries I've enjoyed around the city. I think this will be my new go to dish at Indian places, as I used to be a strictly Chicken Tikka Masala sort of girl.  I tried a samosa as well on my second time around, and although they were clearly handmade and the flavors were great, I thought charging $2 for a samosa that small was ridiculous (especially when you get can one at least twice the size across the street for a dollar). On a brighter note, the mint chutney that accompanied it was delightful and I used it as a nice balance to the heat of the curry.  The staff was pleasant and helpful, as usual. The decor of the joint still is really beautiful, bright, and clean. I accidentally went a little close to their closing for lunch and did feel a little rushed, but that's a silly mistake on my part. This place is good if you know the right things to get!",

Generally, I am not very severe on a mistake in serving the wrong food item. But providing non-vegetarian meal instead of a vegetarian meal is a grave mistake. Especially since it is an Indian cuisine place. An Indian restaurant should be aware of the Indian sentiment when it comes to vegetarian & non-vegetarian food.   The worst part actually was the owner's reaction to this mistake. They didn't seem very apologetic either about it. This was a very sad experience.",

She needs to get management and hospitality courses and then run a restaurant. Terrible value for money and too small portion sizes.  It all started with warm beer. When asked the server told that their cooler was not working. If this was the case then they should have told that the same before. Then we ordered the appetizer \"Delhi ki papri chaat\" which according to the menu should have papri, potatoes, chickpeas and chutneys. But we were served with just papri and chutney (no potatoes, no chickpeas, plain papri and chutney). On asking the server told that he will call the owner to talk to. The owner never showed up until we were done eating the main course. On asking the server again to call the owner to talk to but she didn't even have the courtesy to show up. On our getting upset on receiving the check, the server was able to call the owner lady who instead of accepting the mistake or apologizing and replacing the dish, kept saying that they alter the menu for their american customers and were too busy to change the menu. On top of that, to my surprise, she blamed is for calling her thrice to enquire about the appetizer we were served as she was too busy that evening and kept on giving lame excuses. We ended up getting no replacement for the appetizer and ruining our dinner!!!  Would never even think of going there and would not recommend ever.",

If you really crave good Indian, try going to Tamarind, Prince of India, or All India (all places are less than 1-2 miles from Yuva India, much cheaper and authentic).  Long Rant Follows:  This place continuously disappoints me (and it is the opinion of my non-yelper Indian friends too). It serves the most pricey and \"fraud Indian\" cuisine I have ever had. Having spent more than 20 years in India, I can say this with authority. Here are some instances when I felt like walking out of this place 1. Masala Chai: The chai served here is without milk. Any Indian can tell you that this is just plain wrong. 2. Pav Bhaji: I was served pav bhaji with a Naan instead of an American sandwich-bread, as is the dish all over India. It is hard to imagine that in the USA it was tough to get this ingredient. 3. Tadka Daal: I get the most bland daal I have had in my life. Obviously, there is no tadka at all.  At all occassions I have informed the management only to get replies like \"We alter the menu to better serve American tastes\". Don't get me wrong, I agree that one can change spices/recipes etc. However, all the above instances are outrageous. To those who cannot relate - it is like being served Falafel with a burger bread, without any warning.  And of course, the price here doesn't justify there quality of service or dishes. This is the priciest Indian restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh. In my opinion, going to \"Taste of India\" in the CMU campus is a much better deal. Taste of India in the campus is much cheaper, authentic but serves a repetitive menu.",

The mango lassi is good, but that's pretty hard to mess up... The prices are kind of steep considering the amount of food you get, too. The restaurant decor is cute and clean but it feels very open and empty during off-hours since the dining area is just a single open room. They close between lunch and dinner so plan accordingly.  If you're craving indian food I suggest skipping this place and going up the street to Tamarind instead.",

    "text": "I am a semi-regular visitor. In other reviews, I have noticed lots of complaints regarding customer service, but in my opinion there isn't a significant difference between the service in this place and elsewhere. Courteous and quick enough for me.  The food is good if you order it spicy. Their Baingan Bhartha especially is quite delicious. The other items on the menu are also in general tasty and well-prepared (though I wouldn't recommend the Dal Tadka, it isn't what you are used to if you are Indian.)  Overall I'm giving this place 4 stars out of 5 because of two reasons:  1) They serve rice with every dish and do not allow for substitutions. To be fair, this appears to be the general practice in all Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I've been to; this is remarkably pointless and inauthentic. It makes absolutely no sense to serve rice with a majority of the dishes on the menu, especially the dry dishes. This is the biggest reason I do not go there more frequently, and I almost gave a 3 star rating because of this. If you work at Yuva India and you are reading this, I sincerely suggest that you allow your customers to replace the rice with some basic butter naan. If that is too expensive for you, at least include an option to upgrade the rice to naan for a small price.  2) In my opinion the price is a little too high. The food here is quite good, but there are other Indian places that serve equally good food at a lower price. (Nearby Tamarind comes to mind).",

    "text": "When me and my friend first walked in to Yuva, we were surprised to find an empty, quiet restaurant on a Saturday night on Craig Street. However, the interior design was clean and put together, which is a quality often lacking in (dive-y) Indian restaurants.   When we were given the menu, we noticed that the options were far more scarce and expensive than listed on the website. That said, a vegetarian dish is far more expensive than other Indian locales, clocking in at $13 rather than $8-10 like most places.   When I ordered my dinner, I asked if I could get the vegetarian option but with chickpeas added to the vegetables. I would have been willing to pay a few dollars more for added protein, as the vegetable curry featured only broccoli, cauliflower, and peppers. The waiter, who seemed to not know what a chickpea was, said I would be charged for two curries: the one I intended on order and the only other curry featuring chickpeas. It was confusing, but I backed down and stuck with the regular vegetables.   When my dish came- the \"Killer Curry\"- my experience improved. The Killer Curry was extremely spicy, which is just to my liking. The basmati rice, while not being spiced or flavored, was nicely cooked, and the entree came with a salad, which was a nice, refreshing touch! I finished the whole dish in one sitting, and the waiter told me I am only the third person to have finished the Killer Curry.   Conclusion: if you're looking for a bustling restaurant, go at lunchtime. That will be the only other time I go there because the prices are better and it will be more crowded. Also, no substitutions in dishes unless you'd like to be charged for TWO expensive curries rather than one.",

I forewarned them that based on the Yelp reviews that it was A-ok but not stellar. So I didn't have high expectations.   I ended up really liking my meal. I ordered the Bhindi masala and asked for not too spicy which they designated as being medium spicy. I went with it and there was definitely a kick to my dish. The texture was more on the dry side (not a lot of sauce). The mixture of okra, onions, tomatoes, coriander and other spices was delicious and fresh. It was reasonably priced at $12.50 and it came with basmati rice and a small side salad. Other reviewers complained about the price, but for dinner and its ample portion, I thought it was a great deal.  In terms of ambiance, it's more of a modern/casual take on traditional Indian cuisine. Silverware are already placed on tables in caddies and water did come in large plastic cups. Service was attentive but we were one of two parties in the restaurant.   I will certainly try Yuva again.",

Each one of us had to get up to compensate for the staff to get napkins, plates, refills.... 5. If anything Mr Navin should be present on weekends to witness the debacle of a restaurant first hand and take some onus. Start with refunding our money ....",

    "text": "This is one of my my favorites if not my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's a bit pricy for me as a college student, but the atmosphere is very modern, it feels like a higher-end authentic restaurant in India, the food is delicious, and the staff is very friendly. You really get what you pay for, if not more.  I would recommend going in for lunch because dinner is more expensive, but the food is superb regardless. Their naan comes with almost every meal and, I'm not kidding, it's the best naan I have ever eaten in my life. The fluffiness and texture of the bread is always perfect and always contains the right balance of sweetness and saltiness. I would recommend ordering one of their dishes that come with rice, curry, naan, and freshly tossed salad; you can't go wrong with those. I have come to realize that after eating Indian food, I always feel tired and lethargic shortly afterwards, but never at Yuva. Their food often makes me feel light, healthy, and provides sufficient energy for me to tackle the rest of my day.  Aside from the food, their staff is very friendly and always welcome me with a warm smile. I tend to drink a lot of water, and not one time has my cup been empty due to constant refills. They ask if everything is okay periodically during your meal, to ensure that you are satisfied and have all your needs fulfilled. When you are done eating, they always hand you the check at the right time not making you feel rushed, and they always wish you well as you walk out the door.   Overall, the dining experience at Yuva is remarkable and rises well above the average restaurant. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a satisfying lunch!",

    "text": "I placed a takeout order from Yuva through GrubHub. It said the order would be ready in 30 minutes and so I arrived 20 minutes after I ordered it, expecting to wait a few minutes after I found a parking spot (no easy feat on S. Craig St.). When I got inside and told the lady at the counter that I was picking up a takeout order, she said they still had not received it. As I was calling GrubHub customer service, she \"happened\" to find it as I got through to an agent and rushed it to the kitchen. I asked the agent to look into it and admittedly the order failed to be delivered the first two times, whether due to a failing on GrubHub's part or Yuva's part, I do not know. However, it was confirmed that the order had made it through ten minutes earlier.  At long last, when we had our food and made it home, we tried the food and were utterly disappointed. The samosas were poor compared to others I have had, a tough maneuver to pull off given they are usually frozen samosas anyhow. We also had bhaigan bhartha and kofta curry (known at authentic Indian places as malai kofta), both of which were a major disappointment. I have had malai kofta at many different Indian restaurants and this was the least flavorful I have ever experienced. The bhaigan bhartha, on the other hand, was charred so much that the smoke level nearly exceeded every Scotch in existence. We requested that both be made spicy and neither were. I will certainly never be going back. I highly recommend Taj Mahal on McKnight and Taste of India near the Children's Hospital if you want actually good Indian food.",

I wish their \"veggie lunch\" had something other than palak paneer. I loved this, but I had to eat this every visit because the only other veggie option was paneer makhni or to order ala carte which was $14 without tax + tips.  I liked their thali which was surprisingly filling with dal maakhni (which tasted *very* good). Don't buy the \"killer curry\". It is just some tomato sauce, just hot chilly powder and veggies which seems to be made up for the American clientele. You'd be better off with the traditional Indian dishes.   I really think they have gone from a one-star experience from previous years to 3-star. The host was a very nice and kind woman.

We ordered off the lunch menu which included an entree, salad, rice and fresh naan. Food came out very fast and the staff was very polite/accommodating. This isn't the best Indian I've had, but the food was pretty tasty, especially the naan. Everyone in my family enjoyed it even my sometimes picky kids. To top off the off the experience, my five year old was proudly telling everyone it was his birthday and then they surprised us by serving him a complimentary slice of Oreo cheesecake!",

Yuva's portions are normal sized, they are not small! The other Indian places have huge portions. I grew up eating Indian-type food, and trust me no normal sized person eats THAT much biriyani or chicken tikka masala for dinner.  The quality at Yuva is much better than anywhere in Pittsburgh, except for Udipi of course. We got the goat biriyani and the butter chicken. Really good cooking and flavorful food. I hate those Indian places where mild foods taste bland. Here the medium butter chicken was creamy and had a slightly sweet undertone. The goat biriyani was spicy though! If you are a medium spice level eater at other Indian places, you might want to go with a mild here. It's always easier to add pepper if you need to. And please don't go the lunch buffet way. Keep it classy.",

Some may think they are charging more for the upscale decor. Well, in my opinion, so be it. Finally I found a place where I can even take my customers for an Indian meal and not have to worry about looking like a cheapskate ! the renovated ambiance is great and if they can get a full bar, linen napkins and get rid of the cheesy bollywood music and TV, then I will say that they have something no other Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh has - atmosphere ! The food was very good, too so I have absolutely no complaints with the kitchen. The seekh kebabs were thick and moist and the Malai Koftas just right. I will definitely be back.",

I tried to tell them this as they poured extra water and left an extra menu, but they completely ignored what I said. They later seemed kind of irritated when they figured out that there wasn't another person joining us.  The food was decent, although I got the wrong dish.

Pros: * Decent Indian food * Nice decor  Cons: * It's expensive compared to other Indian restaurants of similar quality within a 10 minute walk * I ordered a vegetarian dish and they brought me chicken.  When I said I don't eat chicken, they insisted the chicken was cheese, so I tasted it.  I'm a vegetarian, so I was pretty upset about eating chicken, and instead of apologizing they just tried to convince me it wasn't a big deal.  They eventually did give us our meal for free * I ordered mild food, and it was definitely spicy.  Again, they tried to convince me it was mild.   * The waitress new nothing and didn't really seem to care.  I asked her a couple of simple questions about the food and she just shrugged instead of trying to learn about them * They were just generally a mess in terms of service  If it wasn't for the fact that I (a vegetarian) ended up eating meat there, I would have given them 2 stars.",

    "text": "Absolutely horrible experience. I came with a friend deciding to try out this new place on Craig Street after Star of India moved out of the same space. I usually don't bother reviewing restaurants on Yelp but this experience left me flabbergasted with regard to the food they decided to serve me.  Firstly, the wait. We arrived at 8:30 PM, and the restaurant was about 2/3 full. The decor was nice and the waiting staff relatively friendly. About 15 minutes into looking at the menu, the waiting staff informed us that they were \"extremely busy\" and that there would be a wait in taking our order. Ok. Busy shifts happens. No big deal. We wait.  And waited. and waited. Finally, 20 minutes later, they finally decided to take our order. We thought the kitchen cleared up by then and expected our food shortly (we had a very small order -- just two entres. A lamb kourma and a seafood biryani). Little did we know, more waiting.  It took about 45 minutes for them to cook and serve our food. Unfortunately, this wasn't the end of our ordeal. My seafood biryani (with shrimp) came out raw. The first bite into my shrimp, I definitely knew something was wrong. It simply wasn't cooked! I sent it back, and the wait staff apologized. About 5 minutes later, my food finally came in it's edible form.  Now down to the review of the food. My friend's lamb was very generic and not worth the money. There was barely any meat and consisted of mostly bones, cartilage, blood vessels, and connective tissue. My seafood biryani was beyond spicy and the spiciness just left a numbing sensation in your mouth. You get used to it though, and it wasn't particularly horrible in the end; however I would not have paid $12.50 for something like that. The portion sizes were also extremely small.  You would think my ordeal ends here. Nope. The next day, I spent half an hour on the toilet, presumably from some form of indigestion or food poisoning I've acquired in the restaurant.  The only redeeming factor in this place is the friendly wait staff. They apologized for the wait and food, and gave me my meal for free.  Unfortunately, this will not be enough to have me back. Suffice to say, I will not be returning.",

    "text": "two parts to this review:  1 - The food was very enjoyable and had good blends of spice and flavor.  I would not recommend the lamb slippers appetizer as they tasted more like greasy burgers than anything else.  The Lamb spinach massala and the chicken tikka massala were both very well made, however the portions were small and the price per dish was well above the norm.  The food alone would probably get around a 3.5 star (marks taken off for small portion and price).  2 - The service could not have been worse, and completely ruined the experience for me and my wife.  It was around 10 minutes to have our order taken, with a further 20 until we received our apps.  When our entrees arrived they were both wrong (the wife received chicken instead of lamb, mine was a completely different dish altogether).  Upon sending them back we had to wait again after mine was brought out, then 10 minutes passed before my wife's replacement came out.  The indian family at the table next to us experienced something similar, and upon telling the owner that the meal was incorrect, she actually told them that they were wrong, refused to change what was delivered, and refused to take it off their check.  When our check arrived, it had 4 extra orders on it, we had the server take it back and change it and it took a further 2 trips to get this correct.  The whole place was badly managed, the staff were polite but did not have a strong understanding of their roles and what was required of them.  The owner is rude and unwilling to take any sort of feedback.  The kitchen took too long with each order.  With the other options for Indian food in Pittsburgh, I will never return to this restaurant, and recommend you not to waste your time either.",

I'm not sure if they've lowered the price but didn't see any main course that price at $16 as the reviews below said.  We got the Samosa appetizer 2 pcs. for $3.99 which I think it's reasonable price.  The main dishes we got is $12.95 and $13.95 which is comparable to another Indian place down at the other end of Craig Street.  The food is fresh and cooked with lots of spices (which mean they use lots of spices/ not mean too spicy hot).  I could taste the intense spice in all dishes, which I think that's what should be expecting for in Indian food.  Even the filling of Samosa have a taste of spices, whereas other places would only be mild tasting potato with no flavor.  The portion may seem a bit small but with one appetizer, two entrees that come with rice and one garlic naan, filled me and my husband up without the need to take anything home.  Will definitely go back.",

The shank was an enormous hunk of meat attached to a skyward pointing bone. The presentation immediately garnered oohs and aahs from my friends, who all scrambled for a bite (hands off, it's mine!!!).  As for the taste (which is what really matters, right?!) it was like nothing I could have imagined. There was an enormous medley of exotic spices blended in the sauce, and the meat was soooo tender- literally falling off the bone. I hadn't had lamb before, but I finally figured out what the appeal is: it has a rich earthy taste that fills you with every bite.   The food I ordered was quite spicy (just the way I like it), but my cup was always filled with water by the prompt waiter- did I mention that he was very cute? The atmosphere of the place is also very nice: they have a TV with lots of Indian pop music videos, and there's large pictures from around India all over the place. What I'm trying to say is that it feels like you're stepping out of Pittsburgh and into a little exotic alcove of delicious foodstuffs. The polished wooden floor was spotless and all the silverware was shiny! What more can I say? I'll definitely be going back next week.",

Familiar with Oakland, we drove over and found easy parking, welcomed by a very nice staff and a good-vibes atmosphere. I tried paneer palak for the first time at Yuva Indian and immediately fell in love - I have always been one for Indian cuisine and had been eager to try this dish. The paneer palak was creamy, perfectly tasty, and spicy! The waiter asks you regarding spice level; I usually get the spiciest when I go out for Asian cuisine, and I would say the dish was spicy but certainly allowed for taste of dynamic Indian flavors. I discovered Yuva Indian with a friend who had never before tried such flavorful cuisine - I would say this is a great eatery for someone new to Indian - very round flavors and sauces. My friend tried the chicken tikka masala and loved it. Ever since going to Yuva Indian my love for such a culture has only grown as I explore my own abilities cooking Indian food and seek out other tasty ethnic food joints in the Pittsburgh area. We will most definitely be back!",

One of my favorite experiences there was Valentine's Day, when I went with my boyfriend. They had a special Valentine's Day menu with different options for couples, and the package we got was naan, lamb chops, curry, and dessert for $50. At the very end they handed him the check and me a bouquet of roses, haha!  Aside from special holidays, I also go there often for lunch or dinner when I don't feel like cooking. Their lunch menu has very reasonable portion sizes. I would try the Yuva Lunch on your first time there, because it has a great sampling of their best curries and comes with naan, rice, and salad. I almost never am able to finish the entire meal. For dinner, I normally get the chicken tikka masala, which never disappoints. The only  thing that I ever had that I didn't like was the mint and cumin lassi. I expected the drink to be sweet, but it was really strange and bitter-tasting.  The ambience is quite nice and the owners often come up to greet me. They have this wonderful tv behind the counter which plays Indian music videos all the time, and it's hilarious as well as educational...",

As an Indian who has had Indian food from my parents, aunties, uncles, weddings, parties, and other Indian festivities countless many times, in addition to trying as many Indian restaurants as possible in the city I am currently living in (I move a lot), Yuva is seriously one of my favourites.  My boyfriend currently lives in Pittsburgh and I make sure to eat there at least twice on every visit.   I usually get the paneer makhni and channa masala.  Their naan is super soft and on point.  The food is consistently so fulfilling.  We have never had a problem with the service (not sure about all those complaints).  The waiters are friendly, accommodating and quick.  We never have to flag them down, nor are they hovering over us as we eat, both common problems in many Indian restaurants I've been to.   I wish there were more Yuva's.  I love this place.",

    "text": "We visited Yuva India hoping it was improved from the Star of India experience we had in the fall.  Unfortunately, it was not.  While the restaurant is newly remodeled and looks nice, everything else seems the same.  AND there are no high chairs, which is a automatic \"we won't be coming back\" for this family.   The food is quite pricey for Indian, even the soft drinks are $2.50! We sat down and about ten minutes later someone asked us if we wanted anything else besides water to drink. We asked if we could please order because we have a toddler. They took our order Chicken Tikka Masala and the Sea Bass, with Garlic Naan. The restaurant was 2/3 full and after seeing two tables of people who came in after us get food, we asked where our order was -- it had been 35 minutes since we ordered (with a toddler who was losing his patience). They said they would check on it, and then came back ten minutes later to tell us the food was just being cooked and would be ready in \"two minutes'  --- ten minutes later our food arrived.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was good, although the portion only had 6 pieces of chicken. Not very much of a value for $14. But the sauce had a great flavor. The sea bass on the other hand was VERY fishy tasting.   The server offered a slight apology for our wait time, but nothing else was done to redeem our visit. Two entrees and one order of naan cost us $40 and with almost an hour wait for food, we will not be coming back.  The funny thing is, when we visited Star of India in the fall, we came in, placed or order and waited over an hour for food before walking out. Although they said there is no relation to the Star of India management, it's a tough sell in the customer service department....  This family will stick to Tamarind and India Garden.",

Absolutely delicious and perfect spice level - medium spice is perfect for those who like spicy food but aren't necessarily looking for a challenge!  It's a little pricier than your standard Indian in Pittsburgh, but it's worth it!  Not too greasy.  They definitely add their own flair.  Service was great, and the atmosphere was meh to relaxing. Nice light fixtures.  We're not too big on ethos though.",

I ordered the garlic naan and kadhai paneer, my SO ordered the goat vindaloo. We enjoyed the meal very much. However, the portions are so small. I could have eaten at least two portions of my meal. I left still hungry. The cost is a bit pricey considering how small the portions are.",

    "text": "I've been going to the star of india for years, so I was eager to try this new indian restaurant which just opened up in it's place.  Yuva did not disappoint.  The staff was knowledgeable and friendly.  Yuva had new, massive photographs of Indian spices decorating the walls.  They had a huge selection, and everything was delicious and homemade.  My only complaint was the price for the small entree portions did not seem like a good value to me.  The $16+ entree portions were just small bowls.  They were very tasty, but I expected more.  That said, the appetizer sampler and naan bread sampler were very reasonably priced and generous.  To get a good value I'd skip the entrees entirely and stick purely to the appetizers and sides, doing that I would gladly come back to Yuva again!",

I would highly recommend the food at Yuva because most of the indian restaurants serve greasy food, Yuva however is an exception with the right amount of spices and right taste. All in all, I visit here very often and the quality of food and the service always amazes me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...!!!!!",
