It was packed because they were giving veterans dinners for free.  We still got a table for 4 right away.    I got the lunch special with the half California club, friess and a salad for $7.98. Someone else got the deep dish pizza, and another got spaghetti and meatballs.    We did have a long wait for food, about 45 minutes.  My food wasn't warm at all, hence the 4 stars, but it was still very good.   I tried the spaghetti and it was delicious.   My friend with the deep dish said the crust was to die for.   We also tried their hand crafted black cherry soda, which was very good and had free refills.    Try the seasonal snickerdoodle pizookie, it was amazing!   Our waiter was friendly and efficient.  I'll go back again.",

    "text": "We waited about 45-60 minutes for a table. This is typical for our area. The nice thing is that they text you so you can leave and walk around the mall to pass the time. We chose to stay and were offered samples of pizza while we waited.....which was excellent! The service was excellent and all our food was brought within a reasonable amount of time. The menu selection was very diverse with many options to choose from. If you have a picky eater, that will not be a problem. All of the food was outstanding and everything that I saw go by to other tables looked fantastic. The food is exactly as pictured on the menu. I had the shrimp tacos and they were delicious with the cilantro lime sauce that came with it. My daughter had the chicken broccoli alfredo and she loved it! The portions are large so you could split a meal especially if adding a salad or appetizer. The side salad add for $3.75 was a bit pricey but after tasting it I was glad I ordered. Two people could actually split the side salad. Other people I dined with got a burger and a chicken sandwich which were also large an very good. I tried a specialty beer (bumbleberry) which was excellent but pricey at $6.50. We shared one of their warm cookie desserts with ice cream.....again it was pricey but big enough to be shared easily with 2-3 people. I will definitely be back.....so many things I want to try!",

This is like blue collar style cuisine for people who drink and smoke a lot and have no taste buds - in other words, typical Pittsburgh food. Also it was more like very cheap fast food lo mein than anything remotely Italian.",

It wasn't very long, but my husband had already finished his entree by the time it returned. The manager, without requesting him, arrived at our table and apologized for the salad (which was fine the second time around) and the fact that we didn't share our meals together. He offered us dessert on the house! That's how customer service should be! And the food was delicious!!!",

I had the Jambalaya which would have been good except it was terribly over spices. I like spicy....this was terribly overspiced. My companion had the shrimp and penne which he said was okay. Again, not great or good....ok.   On the positive the wine prices were pretty good especially by the bottle....and some good IPA's.   Very open place which makes it very loud.

The jambalaya seemed as if it had been cooked hours before we ordered it. Everything in it was soft and mid-evolution into an eventual gray gelatinous mass. I wasn't duped by the shovel full  of dry seasoning heaped on the top of it all at the last minute.   Tonight I ordered the kale and mushy, grey roasted brussel sprout salad with a previously frozen, now burnt salmon jerkey plank. I ordered the grilled rather than the blackened salmon, but it was charred and was like eating  salmon  taxidermy. My wife's burger too was well done a few minutes before they removed it from the grill.   I did savor my drink of water though --- I had to as refills were scarce. Sorry BJ's",

    "text": "Great layout, tasty looking menu, creative drinks, friendly staff, but but needs just a little fine tuning on operation. Bj's has been open at this location for aprox a month and I think it will be extremely popular once they're rolling.  Experience: We received prompt seating at 4pm in a nice, large booth facing all of the sports games (which was perfect). Our server was friendly and sweet. We ordered the artichoke appetizer and soup salad combos. We requested our food to be \"coursed\": app first, then salad, then soup after salad so that the soup wouldn't get cold while we were eating everything else (this has happened to me before and so I was specific about it). *This didn't happen.  The app came out extremely hot and so we had to wait for it to cool. We didn't mind that, but then our soup and salads arrived together....and we weren't finished with the app and the soup was warm, not hot, which meant it went cold by the time we were finished with our salads...which is why I asked for it to be timed out. Nobody wants to eat cold clam chowder. The timing of the food was disappointing. *Side note: They need to check the silverware before wrapping it.  Food: The artichoke app was slightly briny but ok. House salad was delicious with fresh greens and veggies and I really like the balsamic dressing (ask for it on the side). The Caesar salad was way over dressed. I'm not exaggerating, we didn't finish it. The clam chowder had nice flavor and we would order it again. However, I would want it to be a good temp instead of warm to cold. *Tip: No bread, crackers, or anything served with it, so you may want to order it in a bread bowl if you're looking for that. The Smores Pizookie came out perfect. I like that they offer a Pizookie Trio so that you can try more than one kind if you choose.   They have daily deals and the servers should offer those when giving you the menu's. It makes you wonder if the staff gets to do menu tasting so that they can let you know what's their favorites are or what's popu  We'll be back because we see the potential and know they just opened and it takes time to perfect things. I am detailed in this review in hopes that they will make adjustments because I really like the place. Not to be harsh. I would give it 3 1/2 stars and my relative said 3 stars.   Another user wrote that if you check in on Yelp that you get a free Pizookie or App...I checked in, but didn't get that notification/ offer...disappointing :(.",

Usually, I just take the cheese, bacon, scallions, etc off the top and skip the potato. At BJ's they double crisp the potatoes....AMAZING! The pizookie is incredible! If you're on a diet, it's totally worth breaking it for day! The staff is very friendly and it's a very clean establishment! I definitely will be returning! I love how close it is as well!

I was excited to try their home brews but those every was terrible especially the Porter.  None of them had any taste.  The Porter literally tasted like colored water.  One of the only times I can remember not being able to finish a beer. It was quite disappointing since this was a brew house.  I will go back and try it again as maybe the problem will be fixed as they just opened up.",

I must say, for a chain, the food is good and they have a lot of fresh options, in addition to the fried foods and pizzas. Their pizza is delicious- I enjoy the small Hawaiian personal size pizza, it reminds me of a fancier version of school pizzas. Their ranch is also really good, which is important to my boyfriend and I since we love ranch dressing. Their boneless wings are delicious, however we didn't love their signature root beer glaze- it was way too sweet for us. Brendan had a burger here the past two times he visited and he liked it both times. I opted for a salad the most recent time- it had quinoa and blueberries and kale, among other delicious healthy ingredients. It was so good! I was really impressed with the freshness of it. Their appetizers are yummy- I love the fried portabella mushrooms, as well as the roasted Brussels with sriracha. Service has always been great and the beer selection is really impressive. I would love to come here for a game sometime or happy hour.",

    "text": "This was my first time at this restaurant and it will definatly be my last.  this past Sunday I ordered the Hickory Bacon Burger well done on a gluten free bun with the tumeric cauliflower on the side. It took a really long time to get our food but it was busy so we were not upset by it. Everything was fine at first until I bit into the burger and it was medium at best.  I know people make mistakes so I asked Tom the waiter, to please correct the mistake.  30 minutes later I still did not have my burger and the waiter had not been back to talk with us or explain why the long wait, although he was sitting down at a nearby table.  When he passed by 30 min later,  we grabbed him (he had no intentions of stopping to check in with us) and told him it had been 30 min at this point we needed to leave and to box up the burger.  A few minutes later the manager came to our table with the bill and told us she was removing the burger from the bill, which of course was the right thing.  When we got home with the corrected burger I went to eat it and it was charred black and hard as a rock.  I could not even bite into it AND it was not on a gluten free bun.  I asked for a well done burger not one that is charred to a crisp. (I took a picture of it and will try to post it here if I can.) Luckily I noticed the bun was not gluten free before I bit into it.  The bathrooms were also a complete mess.  The ladies room had pee all over the seat and stall along with toilet paper strewn all over.  My son reported that the mens room was also a mess with paper towels in the sink.",

    "text": "For those of you tired of going to the North Hills BJ's has now opened a second location on the grounds of the South Hills Village mall near Jared's.  When I arrived I was greeted warmly and i got to meet the manager. The place was wide open so I could seat either at their craft draft bar or at a table. I opted for a table. The waitress and her assistance went over their points program where you install their mobile app you get VIP treatment. According to the brochure the app allows you to get on their preferred waitlist, order ahead of time, receive special offers, pay directly from the app, and earn points. Since they just opened on 8-8-16 I was told that if I download their app I was entitled to a free mini pizooke which is really a type of warmed cookie covered by a scoop of vanilla ice cream. So I did this and created an account.  They explained to me their history and then told me they were especially known for their pizza and craft brewery.  I decided to order a lunch special which they call lemon thyme chicken. It comes on a bed of rice and some vegetables including tomatoes and brussel sprouts. They even give you a tablespoon along with your regular utensils. When I got it I noticed it was lukewarm so I had it sent back and got a whole new entree. It was very good and quite filling. The place has free Wi Fi but for some reason I was having a little difficulty with it.  Nevertheless I ordered my pizooke where you have a choice a caramel cookie, chocolate chip or peanut butter and covered with ice cream. Since it was a mini it was a generous portion size for me and more than enough. The cookie literally melted in your mouth since it was heated. The ice cream is your standard vanilla. Nothing overly exciting about it.  They do have an extensive menu and a listing of all the craft beers on the wall for you to choose from.I do like the fact that they offer more of a variety than a competeter in the mall. I also noticed as I was leaving the place was filling up fairly quickly. It may be because they are new but they do offer some variation to what this mall needs in terms of restaurants. I was grateful for a new place to go next time I visit. Please note that it is not located in the mall itself but towards the right side in the parking lot. I would imagine it is similar to the one currently open in McCandless.",

We got there 2 minutes before Happy Hour ended so she made sure to hurry up and get in our appetizers and beer for happy hour price. She was attentive and answered my million questions I had about the food.   The beers are always Ok here. I am not amazed by any that I've had. For an appetizer we had chicken pot stickers which were yummy because typically those are hard to find. Almost all the appetizers here will run you about $9-$11 dollars which is pretty crazy for a small appetizer.  For dinner I had the turkey dip. So good! Again this is not something you typically see. Their menu is very diverse so you should have no problem finding something you like. My husband had the Buffalo chicken pizza which was good but not great.  The atmosphere is fun and you should enjoy yourself here. However be expecting to have an $80 chain restaurant type meal for two.",

I started with the craft beer taste and that was pretty cool. My favorite was the berry shandy - opted for a full pint next.  For dinner I had the brisket bacon burger and it was incredibly good.  My wife had the prime rib. Now I've only seen a few places that know how to do prime rib right ... And this place made it right! Melts in your mouth and not chewy at all.  I can't wait to go back ... If you like craft beer and good food. Strike that ... Great food then you have to go to BJs! Even if you're not much into craft beer ... This place will change your mind.",

    "text": "I had a nice lunch and couple of beers at this popular chain restaurant in South Hills Village. I had stopped by there before once but it was packed, so I tried again at a non-peak hour and got a seat at the bar.  It's a large restaurant with high ceilings and just one big room. The bar area is at a side and the bar is against the wall, so there is just one row of bar stools as opposed to the layout where the bar has stools surrounding it on all sides. They have very nice quality screens behind the bar that were playing baseball. It's a good place for watching games if you get a seat at the bar. Screens, though, did not seem overly plentiful so I'm not sure I would characterize this as a sports bar.   Service at the bar was very nice and the bartender gave me a couple of samples without my asking for it.  They have a selection of their own brews, about 10 or so in different styles and I got an amber beer and then a double IPA. The beers were good but maybe not quite as distinctive as what I have got at some of the local breweries in this area. There's also a large number of taps for beers from other breweries if you don't want one of the in house beers.   The menu is huge and I found a lunch section buried in it and decided to get a caprese sandwich, which had some different types of cheese and a basil flavor inside a rolled flatbread. It was decent for a light lunch.   They have happy hour specials, but I didn't come at happy hour. Their happy hour has an early start, at 3:00, so it would be worth it to come in the late afternoon if you want a late lunch or early dinner.",

    "text": "Several of my friends have raved about BJ's and it has been on my list to try for an extended amount of time. Finally, I had the opportunity and I would say for the food and experience I had, it was literally \"A-OK\". Why?   My friends were waiting for me when I arrived. The waiter was quick to notice my arrival and instantly came over to ask for my drink order. He proceeded to ask if we were ready to order and of course, I needed some time to decide what my dinner was going to be. Well, it took him another 20-25 minutes to return and ask a second time. This was the case all night. The waiter was very nice but the service was slow and the place wasn't as busy (especially with a Pens game on) as my friends are used to (who are regulars).   Despite being advised to try the Chicken Tortilla Soup from a friend, I took the advice of the waiter and tried the Broccoli Cheddar Soup, pairing it with a Caesar Salad for the soup/salad combo. I can say that this soup is not something I will order again. The color alone was off-putting and it was lacking broccoli and excessive with cheese. The salad was heavily dressed but for a Caesar, I am satisfied with that. My friend offered me a slice of the pepperoni supreme and I took him up on it - thick, bubbly, and tasty! I would definitely try pizza again (especially with their Monday night deal).  This place contains adequate seating with booths, tables, and a nice sized bar. TVs are located on every wall, making it easy to check the score of the game at any point. I thought that the atmosphere was quite loud, especially if it wasn't as full as it typically is. There is adequate parking in front of the restaurant and more can be found in the shopping center if need be.   I truly believe I can have a better experience when I return to BJ's. There are so many options on the menu, including beer that they brew themselves, and I am willing to try other items they offer. I believe this place has the capability to redeem itself in the future.",

That says a lot because she never says that, so it has that going for it. I had the brewhouse burger. I was kinda miffed because I failed to notice that it didn't come with cheese. Not a big deal but it made the burger boring.   The bartenders were nice and refilled drinks when they were empty. Overall it was pretty good, nothing fancy but a decent place to eat.

My wife had the margarita flat bread which was very salty. So the food overall just, meh.   Now the service. It was terrible. Our server was just going through the motions, not overly friendly and did not check on us (how's the meal, need fresh drinks, ect) until well after we were served.   Now what really got me. We left our 3 year olds cup at our table. We were literally gone for 5 mins. When I got back in and asked about it, the hostess was very nice and got the manager. It was this guy that needs some additional training on how to deal with the public. According to the manager, he had asked the staff that cleaned the table and I have to give the benefit of the doubt that did in fact happen. It was his condescending way he told me that it was probably thrown away. I honestly could care less about the $10 cup but as a food services manager, I would expect you to be a little nicer...\"so sorry, let me take your number\", whatever. Instead, he acted like a jerk. If the food was better, maybe I'd be back. But when you add the bad service with so so good, it just isn't worth it. Wish I new his name but if you see a gentleman with glasses and a beard that is the manager, tell him I said hi.",

The menu is huge, so if you're coming with a big party, all taste buds are likely to be accommodated. Bonus for a robust \"light\" menu as well.   Our group numbered well over 10 people at any given time during the evening, and was served in just over two hours, including multiple waves of orders. So, kudos for quick service.

We always enjoy a couple beers here too. Somehow we find the place comfortable!  A great thing to do if there is a 20+ minute wait is to get a beer at the bar and wait there.

The pizza was thick and delicious! For dessert, we shared a pizookie trio. The peanut butter pizookie was amazing. It was cooked to that perfect doughy consistency and melted in my mouth. We also had the salted caramel pizookie and the classic. The salted caramel was delicious as well. Overall, a great place to grab lunch in the South Hills area.",

    "text": "my bf and I decided to stop in after visiting Whole Foods. He suggested grabbing some prepared food from there for dinner. I declined and said I'd rather go to a real place to eat lol. (no hate though.)   I called to reserve but couldn't reach them. I also tried the Open Table and No Wait app with no luck. Finalllllly I went online and noticed you could reserve a spot from online IFFFF you signed up for rewards program. (all of this just to reserve a spot lol) The website gives you no est. time so we eventually went there. They had no info of us even reserving a spot. lol what a fail. The wait was an hour, so we headed over to South Hills Village to shop & browse while we waited.  we decided on drinks and apps. I went with the avocado eggrolls. They were fabulous! Gosh I wish I had their recipe. My bf went with wings. You get 10 wings for about $10.50. not the best deal but whatever. You can also choose boneless (1lb for same price). We went with the buffalo sauce. The wings were excellent.   Since I signed up online for rewards program, I was given a free pizookie, which is a dessert such as cookie, brownie or monkey bread in a dish with ice cream. I went with monkey bread and it was delicious.   For drinks, we went with a mojito. It was very fresh and tasted great. Our server was Chelsea and she did an ok job.  The atmosphere was cool and food was good. We will be back for sure.. maybe even the North Hills location (McCandless Crossing)  Their rewards program gives you 1 point for every dollar spent (before taxes and tip of course). For signing up you get a free pizookie. At 75 pts you get $5 off food and eventually prizes are $10 and $25 off of food. If you plan on eating here more than once, might as well sign up for rewards.   I hope they find a better way to make reservations such as someone answering the phone, no wait app, open table app ect. I know BJ's has their own app, but aint nobody got time for another app on their phone lol",

I finally came here with a few of my girlfriends and we were lucky to score a table at the bar when the wait for a table in the dining room was over an hour long.   The space is pretty nice. They have so many options (both food and drinks) to choose from so it can be a little overwhelming if you've never been here before. And that's exactly how I felt. At the end of the day, I ordered a flight of beer to sample their beer selection and our table shared a large deep dish pizza. I really liked everything I tried! The beers were good and went really well with the pizza. The crust on the pizza was crispy and buttery, which was perfect to me.   There is a long wait here for a reason. The atmosphere is fun, the food and drinks are good, and the menu is huge so there is something for everyone to like!",

She's the one who reordered my food and made a point of trying to make our experience better.  I saw the manager walk by and roll their eyes on multiple occasions through out our meal.

It took forever for her to take our order.  She didn't listen to my order, so I had to repeat it - twice!   She still got it wrong!!!  When my appetizer came out wrong, it took her forever to come back to check on us.  She was snarky when I told her my order was wrong.  I did finally get what I had ordered after a while.  At that point, I needed to leave.  It took 1/2 hour to get our checks, the bartender said that she was \"trying to take the appetizer off.\"  That led me to think since she made a mistake with my appetizer, she was trying to be nice.  Apparently not.  When we got our checks, they were completely screwed up.  When we finally got Her attention, I told her that she had given me my friend's tab and charged my friend's card with my tab...and it included the appetizer.  She said she was just trying to get the right appetizer on the right check.  She didn't.  And then she said \"what is the difference?\"",

We have gone 2-3 times and, each time, I feel my sodium intake has gone through the roof. The food is incredibly salty! If you're used to food cooked with a lot of salt, you probably won't mind. But if you're someone who steers away from a high-sodium diet, you'll probably feel it.   I probably won't actively go to BJs again, and if I do I'll stick to a salad.",

    "text": "Wow! I moved out of Bethel Park a few years ago and came back into town to visit for the holidays. At my dad's recommendation, we checked this place out. Boy we're we disappointed! Let me count the ways:  - Shortly after we received our drinks, as we were looking through the menu, my stepmother spilled a little bit of her drink. When she asked the waitress for a napkin, motioning towards the few drops that had spilled on her menu, the waitress declined to bring them, saying that it was no big deal. So my stepmother sat there with a wet lap.   - When our appetizer (chips with sriracha cheese) came, the cheese was so cold that there was a layer congealed on the top. Since we'd still not been brought napkins or silverware or plates, we ate it hunched over the middle of the table.   - My dad is lactose intolerant, and he even had a brief conversation with the waitress in which she explained that she didn't eat cheese either. As such, he ordered his burger with no cheese. But even despite this conversation his burger arrived covered in cheddar. The runner (notably NOT our waitress, who at this point we had not seen in some time) apologized and said that they would have a new one out in a few minutes. When we finally caught the waitress, she told us that she had pressed the wrong button on the screen.  - I ordered the vegetarian pita, and the pita was so dry that it broke into tiny pieces as soon as I picked it up. So that became a fork meal.  - My stepmother's mushroom salad came with no dressing whatsoever. Her burger was cold and the fries were burnt to the consistency of potato chips--and no warmer!  - My stepmother and I were completely finished eating by the time my dad got his burger, and yet all of the plates remained on our table until shortly before the waitress brought the check. It was at this point that she asked how everything was, and I explained a few of our issues.  - When she finally brought the check, the waitress engaged us in a long conversation (by far the most time she had spent at our table all night) about how she had to make her car payments, etc.--clearly to \"suck up\" and try to recoup some of her tip. She also told us that she had removed the pita and chips from the bill...but in reviewing it I discovered that she had even mixed that up, and in fact she'd removed the chips and the salad. Better than nothing, I guess!  I absolutely understand that kitchens get busy and people make mistakes, but the fact that literally every dish we received was problematic strikes me as a little overboard. Despite this fact, because my dad and stepmother are great people, we tipped 20%. But I can say with certainty that none of us will visit this place again. Although I doubt that matters much, because BJ's is very clearly a quantity-over-quality type of establishment!",

The restaurant is attractive, spacious, and comfortable. The vast selection of dishes is reminiscent of The Cheesecake Factory: page after page featuring almost anything one could imagine. Our server was personable and welcoming.  He made an error in bringing a burger plate instead of the grilled cheese sandwich with mozzarella cheese that my stepson ordered. When brought to his attention, he was apologetic and gracious.  He brought out a replacement quickly, but with the wrong cheese.  We were not charged for this dish, which we appreciated.  The Italian Market meat pizza I ordered ($15.95) and my wife's parmesan crusted chicken dish with broccoli and mashed potatoes ($16.50) were tasty. The pizza contained some small pieces of meat, not a great deal. The turmeric cauliflower side dish of mine was delicious, but overpriced at $4.95.  The meal was pricey for lunch.",

    "text": "So bummed, when I got home after being away for work, the one place I wanted to go to for lunch was BJ's.  Our server Brian was awesome & helped us decide on a beer/cider mix for our celebratory cocktails.  Then we ordered 2 small pizzas.  The BBQ Chicken with extra cilantro & The BJ's Favorite, which comes with 3 meats, meatballs, pepperoni & Italian sausage.  I was most looking forward to the meatballs, we both love pepperoni but we're not big fans of the Italian sausage so we ordered it without that.  When we got the pizzas the BBQ Chicken was covered in celery, which to me is not complimentary to a bbq pizza, we were asked if we just wanted to eat it that way & I said no, since they weren't offering to make it the right way I just said take it off the menu.  After that pizza was taken away we went to eat our 2nd pizza  which my meatballs weren't on & we were told the chef decided not to put them on it because they might (or do) have Italian sausage in them.  This is so frustrating because there were 3 meats listed & we just didn't want one of them, if there were any questions we should have been asked, we never said we were allergic to sausage.  We weren't offered for this pizza to be redone properly either so we just said we'd eat it instead of sending it back to the kitchen & having it takoff our check.  The manager came by & apologized & gave us a free pizookie (which we already had an email for a free one) & our server ended up giving us a free one too.  In the end we were stuffed with dessert but left unfulfilled with a savory lunch.  Once we got home we wished we were just offered for both of our pizzas to be redone correctly & got one free pizookie for our troubles.  It's been a couple of days now & we're still bummed out that one of our favorite lunch places was such a disappointment.  2/15/18 We were contacted by Ray the General Manager & he's buying our next pizza, so happy he's making this right!",

    "text": "After nearly a month with no response from the management of this location, I will copy and paste my review/complaint here in hopes of receiving an answer from someone:  On a recent visit to this location, we encountered, yet again, a continuing problem;  Almost every time we get seated at this location, we request a table and not a booth as I am a wheelchair bound patron to eat dinner with my wife who is able bodied.  Unfortunately, 3 out of the last 4 visits to this location, we have had to ask a passing waiter/waitress for service or if they know who is supposed to serve us.  It is almost as though the waiters and waitresses aren't sure who is serving the middle table section (I am referring to the table section that is somewhat to the left when you enter the restaurant).  We decided, upon this visit, not to say anything to see how long before any of the 5 different employees that passed us noticed that we were not even offered beverages.  My wife set her stop watch:  At 13 minutes, we decided we had had enough and decided to leave.  It is RIDICULOUS that we have to ask for service every time we go to this location. My wife was a waitress for many years and I myself was in customer service management for many years.  We are not nitpicky people and we do not haggle restaurants.  We both know, from our experience, that many part time employees must be trained and turn over can be great at restaurants which makes training standards difficult.  My best guess as to why this issue keeps occurring at this particular location seems to be either 1) management has not trained the table assignments properly and/or 2)  the waiters/waitresses haven't received proper coaching on how to professionally seat a patron.  For instance:  most restaurants, upon seating, ask what beverage that you would like and then state something like \"your server will be with you shortly\", etc.  This is obviously not happening at this location. BJ's food is fantastic, the beverage choices are insanely good.  This issue, however, really needs to be addressed.  If it is happening to my wife and I, it almost assuredly is happening with other patrons as well.",

    "text": "First Visit:   Good and bad!   First the good: Food was delicious, servers were very nice and bubbly. We ordered the ribs (had a good bit of meat on them, and good sauce), the pasta with blackened chicken (very flavorful), baked potatoes (cooked well and came with sour cream, butter, scallions). Many options for everyone on the menu and even some options I haven't seen at other restaurants before!   Second the bad: The servers did not check on us much, the food took about 45 minutes to come out once we finally got to order, which shouldn't have taken that long because we came after the dinner rush to avoid that specifically. The app you can download gives you good rewards but only if you pay using the app, which we would never put our card info in to an app. The rewards should be for any regular paying customer.. Not happy about that.   Would recommend! Food was worth it& menu selection was great.   Second Visit:   Wait was not long. The beers were good but service was bad. This is the second time the service has been crappy. The waitress never checked in, she would disappear when asked for something. Had to wait about 20 minutes every time we wanted ranch, beer, anything really. My brisket burger came without the burger the first time, looked great though and the waitress let me keep the brisket sand which. When she brought out my actual sandwich, I was confused as to what was on the burger. The brisket looked nothing like what was on the previous sandwich and was actually gross looking, they were not the same brisket. I ended up scraping it off my sandwich and using the other brisket. We will be back because of beer and to try other food selections, but don't expect good service here apparently!   Third Visit:   Three strikes and you're out, won't be returning. My experiences seem to get worse each time, we have given this place three tries now. Wait was long, which is fine. Finally got seated and waited forever for anyone to come to our table. Our waitress was a blonde and very unprofessional and not experienced at all. She took forever to bring even our waters out. The service is always horrible and they are not nice either.. usually the food is alright, but I was very disappointed with my fatty burger. She charged our bill all wrong and split it wrong as well. She brought the wrong beer out after saying one was available and then told us we were wrong about her saying that and that she never said it was available. She got extremely defensive and was rude about it.   Don't recommend.. I'm all for giving places lots of patience and multiple tries, but this place has failed me every time I come. Won't be back.",

At this point we had a one year old and a four year old that needed dinner and left for Primanti's.    The frustrating part is that it was not overly crowded and everyone else was getting seated.  I am convinced the hostess did not mark us down as having arrived until the second time I talked to her.   It was nice that they brought around samples (which were amazing), but there are definitely some bugs to be worked out of the process.",

    "text": "We have been here twice since the restaurant opened.  There were high points and low points to each visit.  On the positive side, the pizzas (both thin and thick) are quite good in our opinion.  On both occasions, we had brussel sprouts that were nice too.  Unfortunately, there were some drawbacks.  On the first visit, multiple beers were unavailable due to temperature issues.  It's great that they want to maintain standards, but it was nonetheless disappointing since it is a brewhouse and a driving factor to try their establishment.  What a let down.    While on the first visit, our exceptional server (Marissa) mentioned their app which included a waitlist feature.  I downloaded and utilized it for the second trip.  When our info. was entered at 6:28, the app indicated an approximate 40 minute wait.  My wife and I proceeded to check in as instructed with the hostess at approx. 6:55 and were told that we would be seated in approximately 20 minutes.  This, of course, seemed reasonable - especially hearing the party in front of us (also a group of two) were quoted an 80 minute wait time.  Long story short, the waitlist app feature was worthless.  We were not seated until after 8:00.  In fact, the couple in front of us with a quoted wait time of 80 minutes had a table before us!  While the food was good, the front of the house management - specifically related to the waitlist - was below expectations.  I don't know if we will or will not frequent the establishment in the future.",

They have drink runners so these runners wait until they have a full tray of orders to deliver which means you wait. We've even gotten soups/apps before our drinks. They never seem to get the timing right on apps to meal delivery. The last few times we've gone the apps come out followed immediately by our meals. It's frustrating. Today our food was also cold which baffled us. The food itself is constant and decent. The manager was very kind and handled the situation well but they really need to work better as a team to give their customers a better experience especially because the food is relatively prices for burgers, pasta, etc. I hope they get it together.",

The ambiance is absolutely awesome; they have a lot of space to work with and the doors allow the restaurant to control the noise level.  Food wise, it's on the pricier side for Pitt, I don't exactly look to spend almost $20 for lunch if there's no alcohol involved.  The cheese-curd appetizer was delicious; it's just literally a salt bomb. So beware!  The soup is pretty heavy (had the unlimited soup and salad lunch deal); It was a broccoli cheddar soup that added cheddar on top. On the gloppy side, but I liked the flavor. The salad on the other hand - the caprese - total waste of time. The balsamic is too sweet, and it's missing some salt  and pepper. Not worth the time. Trying something else, next time.",

The first time my friends wanted to go there for dinner and drinks, I remember being unsure - after all, we live in a city with amazing local chef-inspired food options, and BJ's chain restaurant style seemed a little...boring for dinner. I mean, a name like BJ's does not inspire confidence that you'll be receiving a high-end meal. But boy was I wrong. There is a reason people from coast-to-coast rave about this place.  I ordered the Peruvian shrimp bowl the first time I went, and was amazed at how healthy and delicious it was. Filled with a generous amount of shrimp, sauteed spinach and mushrooms, the bowl was utterly satisfying. But what really blew me away was the appetizer I ordered - an ahi tuna poke. The tuna was perfectly  flavored and melted in my mouth. I had a couple friends who are non-sushi eaters try it and they were thrilled that they liked it as well. For them, BJ's was a safe place to try something new.  I've been back several times and I usually order something healthy like the Peruvian quinoa and salmon bowl or their Twisted BLT salad. But I confess to stealing a bite or two of their deep dish pizza (delicious) and trying a mini pazookie (divine). I can also recommend their burgers (cooked to perfection) and their wide variety of appetizers and sides.  I know that usually with a menu this broad and deep there are shortcuts made in the kitchen (like a lot of frozen stuff) but if they are taking any of these cuts I haven't tasted it yet at the dining table. Everything we've ordered has been fresh and flavorful. I highly recommend BJ's for a night (or afternoon) out.",

Some of my favorites include their salads (flavorful and surprisingly hearty), avocado egg rolls, and loaded nachos. Obviously the pizookies are a must-have as well. They are fairly big, so unless you have a huge appetite for dessert, I recommend splitting one with somebody or else ordering the mini size.   The service can be a little hit or miss as the place tends to get very crowded on weekend nights, but at least the servers have all been friendly. Just expect to wait a bit, both to be seated as well as for your food to arrive. Oftentimes the place has been so slammed that it also took awhile to order or have drinks refilled...  The drink menu is extensive and it's fun to try out their different signature beers, especially if you're watching a game at the bar (they have a great setup for this with several big TV's and plenty of space if you wanna eat at the bar as well). The bartenders have always offered great service as well. If you're into beer, the Jeremiah Red and Piranha Pale Ale are two of my favorite brews here.",

    "text": "The restaurant is set up to be inviting and roomy. The server really loves her job so it made our visit really nice. The food took a long time to come considering it was lunch hour on a work day. I had a disappointing bison burger. The bun was stale and dry, the frozen burger was definitely rare although ordered medium. There was approximately a 1/2 tsp of hatch peppers and two pieces of onion. Really disappointing. Although The server rocked, the system of having runners was lacking. Eight minutes for a coffee reheat and water refill?  Five minutes for the sour cream to come for for the baked potato (which had been requested when order was placed)?    I will give the establishment a second try to be fair but will not order the burger, tortilla soup (salty) or baked potato.  Will probably go with an appetizer or flat bread.",

Will not order it again, yet I love a nice piece of salmon on a salad...so I now stick with basics...pizza and burgers here...sometimes chips and queso is a mix bag...comes out not real hot sometimes...or the chips are cold...or sometimes cheese is hot and chips are cold... I like that they have as set up where anyone brings your food...when it is ready, someone arrives with your food or drinks...vs waiting for your server to free up--then things get dried out or cold....

We grabbed a booth in the bar easily during the dinner rush.  The menu is massive, so prepare to be a bit overwhelmed.  We started with a brussel sprouts appetizer.  Almost half of the sprouts were charred and over cooked. The sprouts that were cooked well were delicious.  We didn't say anything because they were very busy.  Our server was very attentive, and always there to help us!  Next, a few of us had caesar salads.  It was a bit overdressed for me.  The dressing was very potent, and the salad was soggy.  Finally, we had pizzas all around the table.  Gluten free and regular.  I can only speak to the gluten free pizza.  It did the trick, but it wasn't the best GF pizza that I've ever had. They also have GF buns.  I'll certainly try this place again, but wasn't overly impressed. Again, the service was EXCELLENT!",

If you hate waiting for a table, make a reservation like you would have to do anywhere else in pittsburgh! Or get the app and get in line when you leave your house.

    "text": "A BJs recently opened in McCandless Crossing near our home. We've gone a few times because we really enjoy the food, however the service is always so horrible. We recently went to the BJs in the South Hills and I was interested in seeing if our experience would be different. It wasn't. The service was super slow and inattentive. We never got our appetizer. Had to ask for a refill from the bar several times and soft drinks/water cups ran dry without refills. They brought out the wrong flavor boneless wings, then charged us for both when we asked to keep the mistake wings since they would just be wasted anyway. We asked to speak with a manager after the waitress told us she wasn't allowed to take it off the bill, and the manager was very short with us. She did take the charge off our bill, but you could tell she just didn't want to deal with us. As a chain restaurant, you'd think they'd have the management and service down pat, but that just isn't the case with BJs. We've now been to two of these restaurants and both had the same poor service. Since this has been our experience across two restaurants and perhaps 6 visits, this issue is a management issue, not a server issue. They are either too short staffed for the number of tables they have or aren't giving their servers adequate training. Don't come here unless you have lots of time to kill and plenty of patience.",

The waitress was extremely apologetic and tried to do everything she could to make the situation better.  The reason for the poor rating has nothing to do with the service or the wait staff.  The reason is due to the manager that was on the floor.  She came over and after my client joked with the waitress about getting a free round of drinks for me having to sit there with a cold shirt for the entire meal.  The manager said she would take care of things and in the end gave us a $9.95 cookie for free.  Not only do I feel this is insulting but it shows how out of touch and cheap the management is.  I do not wish to get a call from the manager on duty or the GM, but when you have a customer ring up a $165 bill, $10 off the top is not much and shows that you are more concerned with your bottom line for every transaction than actually being sorry for a mistake that is your restaurants fault.",

I personally eat the avocado egg rolls as my dinner because you get two huge ones that seem to be stuffed with an entire Avocado each and they have a nice spice to them.  I miss fresh Avocados from my years in Phoenix area.  The ones you buy at Market District or Trader Joes suck.  Apparently all the good ones go to BJ's because their Avocados are Southwest-worthy.  Right now the restaurant is packed from \"eating with the elderly\" time through closing because it is a new and different restaurant in the South Hills so be prepared for a bit of a wait.  If you are a 4 or under party, the bar area is walk-in with tables.  Gotta love PA, the kids can sit in the bar area!  Good for us!

We even got chips n salsa since they were still making the cheese dip for the nachos! It was happy hour and it was half off pizza and the pizza is excellent! I have more than enough for my lunch tomorrow and I'm excited!",

I had my daughters birthday celebration at BJ's with a party of 11.  Half of the group ordered sandwiches and all of bottom buns were moldy!  They were very apologetic and brought out extra French fries since the sandwiches were no longer wanted.  They also Gave us a few free desserts.  I do not think I will return.  Someone in the restaurant told us the moldy buns were reported to them the night before and they still served them!",

They have a nice beer selection (with sampling) and a lot of TVs in case that you want to watch the game. I do have to say that the menu is overwhelming since it's the size of an encyclopedia (maybe I'm exaggerating) but I couldn't decide since there were many good selections. I ended up getting the shrimp scampi and for appetizers we got the original wings and some cauliflower dish. The pasta was decent with a generous portion but it was a bit oily. The wings were good! Very juicy with a drizzle of sauce and ranch/hot sauce on the side. My favorite dish was the cauliflower, it kind of tastes like curry and had a really good flavor! It gets super packed here in the evenings.",

I always get extra lemon Chardonnay butter sauce I can't eat it without the sauce. I got home and the sauce tasted like garlic sauce. I didn't get any hints of lemon at all, no acidity. So when I went back for the CORRECT sauce I tasted it and it was the same sauce I got early. The take out girl said that the prep cooks make it different sometimes. The manager was also just sitting at the bar watching and not saying anything. How do you allow this? I understand if it's a little different but this tasted absolutely nothing like the actual sauce taste. Therefore, I wasted almost $19 on something I won't be eating and I will not be eating for a while. Very disappointed.",

I could make better pizza and that's saying a lot! A mean seriously? They let a customer walk out with this pice of garbage to take home to their family who is looking forward to a great meal but instead gets pice of trash. Straight garbage, if you want good pizza, go to Ardolinos(it's 5 Min away from here). Btw I ate the damn thing anyway because I was starving, however, that's irrelevant.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times now some more busier times than others and some trips with two to four people. The times when it's actually really busy it's terrible the staff at the front are very useless and every time I've made a reservation by my self or attempt to make one with them because there's a long wait it's never ready when they say it is. I've gone here multiple times and they had lost my reservation I assume was the issue or giving to someone else. My first few trips where solid I don't have many complaints the food was all good from the burgers to the flatbread and the piezookies are great. But recently after a bad trip here I'm extremely disappointed. My and a friend came here for a meeting and the waitress we had was absolutely terrible. She kept messing everything up i asked for a water with nice and lemons she brings a glass of water over with ice and no lemons. My friend got a appetizer for him self I had a bite of it and it was fine it being the chips and cheese. For the main dishes I got a meat pizza with the homemade meatballs and sausage and ham and what not. The pizza it's self was ok I don't really see what all the rage is about it being \"deep dish\". It came out warm but no piping hot. My friend got the wings BONE IN she brings out boneless. On top of that he asked for sauce on the side and got them tossed. I mentioned something to the server about it and she kept saying how she was new and just came off training a few days ago. My guest said it was fine but it's upsetting when you really talk about a place a lot but don't get what you want. My big issue was she shouldn't have came out of training if she's not ready yet to be on the floor interacting with guest. Nothing was ever done so that was a bummer. We both got a piezookie and that was ok. I got the cookie and cream one and it was kinda burnt and stuck To the pan. My guest got the brownie one and said it was okay. He seemed very disappointed that they didn't come out in cast iron pans just cheap aluminum. Overall I'll probably end up coming back here because my girlfriend likes it but if I had to pick coming back by my self I wouldn't come back after that last experience and nothing being done.",

    "text": "The last few times I went here I was unsatisfied with the extremely lengthy wait time and service, but this time I am pleased to say it seems as if they have excelled positively in this area to make the restaurant much more enjoyable! My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night and they said it would be 40 min. We looked around the self seating bar area and a nice man from the wait staff proactively helped us find a table as well. Another wait staff told us he just cleared off a table in the area that we probably would not have noticed if he did not approach us. This was an upgrade from the last time we had to wait for a table. Luckily we only waited 10 min this time! Service was great, as well as food and drinks. I got a blueberry cider and loved it! Definitely recommend this drink. My Parmesan cruchicken dinner was also delicious, as well as the chocolate chip pizooki of course. We will be back again!   Updated review: 2019 We went here on another Saturday night around 4:30 thinking we would be ahead of the usual crowd-wait time as usual was 80 min. We put our names on the list and ran some errands. We ended up waited 105min! Much longer than they said it would be. After waiting an incredibly long time for dinner, they texted me that our table was ready. I go up to let them know and he tells me it's still not ready. Not sure what happened but we weren't exactly thrilled in the first place. Just to get drinks it took another 15 min to be waited on. Our waiter was very friendly through. I ordered tortilla soup and a buffalo bleau burger. Both were very good but my soup came out at the same time as my burger and it was cold. I didn't mention anything since I didn't want to wait any longer than we already had tonight. I enjoyed the fries as well and they do have great ranch. If you download the app you get a free pizooki which was nice, but that also took another 25 min after we cashed out for the night. Unfortunately we will not be returning because time and time again service has been slow and wait times have been some of the longest in Pittsburgh that I've been to in a long time.",

But after a couple visits, I have to say, everything I've had was quite different and really yummy! Just give yourself a lot of time to mull it all over...you'll be satisfied with what you get.  Less than satisfactory, however, is their own beer. I would more likely go with one of the other big craft guys on tap. I know they're a big chain, but I think a brewhouse should be able to round up some local beers too.  It's always packed, given the fact that it's one of the very few restaurants in Upper Saint Clair, so be prepared to wait or make a reservation. It's a really open echo-y building which makes it very loud and really supplements the \"big box\" chain feeling.",

Skinny, Older lady, not sure of her name, was rude to me multiple times for no reason. The place wasn't packed so I don't know what her issue was but she should definitely be re-evaluated by her boss because she lacks in people skills.   I ordered food, pointed to what I wanted on the menu and read it out loud and she said \"so what do you want because you're a low talker and I can't see whats on the menu\"  Strike 1.  We never got silverware when we sat down so through our appetizers we had no napkins or utensils. when I received my meal I asked for silverware and she yelled at me saying \"can you just wait until after I get all your food out?!\" In the rudest tone ever and loud in my face.  Strike 2.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and received a beef burger, which was disappointing because I can't eat beef and besides that I wasn't even hungry after the bad energy the waitress gave me. So I ended up not eating or saying anything because the lady was so rude I didn't feel comfortable confronting her. I planned saying something to another waitress but no one passed me to say anything.  Strike 3.  We got a birthday cookie for my friends birthday and she didn't even light the candle! She said she couldnt find a lighter ... uh Never heard that one before! Strike 4!  Awful experience, her attitude literally ruined my night and the candle thing was a huge let down considering we were there celebrating a birthday.  I can't even comment on the food because I didn't eat anything except some nachos which are kinda hard to mess up only having few ingredients. I can say that everyone who did eat burgers complained about their stomachs hurting because they were way to greasy and flavorless at that.   So Overall I won't be going back.",

    "text": "So here's the thing about BJ's. The food is absolutely incredible. They always have great beer selections. The tavern cut pizzas, the burgers, the sriracha queso - all staples. BUT - it's nearly impossible to eat here because of how terrible their waiting system is designed. Particularly around dinner. They have a \"preferred waitlist\" that serves basically no function. You put your name on a virtual list using their app, yet it essentially does nothing. Multiple times I've gone with my family for dinner and we've had to just leave because of the wait. The app will give you an estimated wait time, but the time doesn't actually start until you get to the restaurant - which makes no sense. It's really a shame because the wide assortment of food and great beers would have me eating there a few times per week - if I could get in. So my best advice? Go for lunch, as long as it's not a normal lunch time when there's a chance it could be busy.",

Everything took like a couple uneasy minutes too long. Like have you ever sat in a place and felt like you were being ignored and you were just about to stand up and leave without ordering and then from out of nowhere your server is hovering over you? Creepy. Then the server asked if we needed refills. We replied yes and she once again began playing with her little gizmo. Several minutes later an indentured servant would appear with our flat sodas. Our server never touched a glass a plate it was like she was too good for it. Then when I paid her fancy gizmo couldn't read my card so she told me my bank, dollar bank, wasn't as high tech as her gizmo. Man eat a bag o ****! Plus the food wasn't any better than applebees or fridays.",

To begin I plan on diving into the subpar facets of this franchise, as is commonplace when informing of news. For my accomplices and I found the service to be insufficient on the particular day. The waiter who served us, let his name be absent, started off on a good foot; serving us our beverages in a timely fashion and appearing in good spirit. This soon would take a turn for the worse when approximately three quarters of an hour passed until my acquaintances had received board. To worsen the situation, the very sought after desert \"pizookie\", was received after half an hour of waiting.     To refrain from the unfavorable aspects of this venue, I will go on about the favorable parts over the course of my experience. In short, the water was splendid, as was the caesar.      Thank you for taking your time to read my review. Bon Voyage and Bon Appetit.  Signed,  Jeffor Gregor",

We came on a Tuesday evening around 7:30 and were seated immediately. Our server came over and explained all of our drink options- they make their own soda! I'm not a soda drinker, but that was very cool to me!   I reviewed the menu (which is HUGE, by the way) and everything looked so good. I had a hard time picking what I wanted! The menu was very good at describing all of the dishes and included a fair amount of pictures of the food as well. I ended up ordering the jalapeno burger (substitute with the veggie burger), a Caesar side salad, and a side of the honey sriracha Brussel sprouts.   The service here is QUICK. My side salad was out in no more than 2 minutes. It was perfectly made, too. Just enough dressing & toppings along with the lettuce. Within 10 minutes, the rest of our food was out. The burger was perfect, I just need to ask for more of the chipotle mayo next time because I didn't think there was enough of it. I love that it was topped with fried jalapenos, it was a nice touch! And the Brussel sprouts, oh my GOD. so good. They were cooked so perfectly and seasoned so well. The sauce on them was amazing, but again I had to ask for more of it because I didn't think there was enough on it.   Overalll, I will definitely be coming back. I will recommend this place for sure!",

With a heavy heart I must state that the forks do in fact have a slight curvature. Now, in contrast to my previous opinion I must state the obvious, the polarity of the water is facing directly north to south. This isn't found in many waters even the artisanal ones. Furthermore, the pyramid shape of the water glasses*dolphin noise*is an interesting take on the classic cylinder",

Obviously they have a wide selection of beer, but the food menu offers just as much variety.   The avocado egg rolls are my favorite appetizer. Their pizza is also amazing! There is also a whole menu page dedicated to \"enlightened\" options a.k.a. healthier meals. We loved the poke bowl with buckwheat noodles and the quinoa bowl with chicken. Both were super delicious and full of flavor, while still being healthier options.   The portions are pretty large (I still had half of mine to take home for leftovers), but if you have room for dessert, you've got to try a pizookie. This is a warm oversized cookie served with scoops of ice cream on top... yum!   I recommend downloading the BJ's app, as you quickly rack up points for free items and discounts. You also can use the app to get on the preferred waitlist, so you don't have to wait as long to be seated once you get there.",

The food wasn't anything to write home about it was painfully average. Additionally for the price you pay you would expect a bit higher quality of food. The atmosphere is nice. The most redeeming quality of this place is their renowned Pizookie and that was good and served warm.",

Their brussel sprout salad is one of my favorite things on the menu, and it's not too fattening (they give you calorie info). Today I got the Santa Fe salad, and it was very good too. In the past I've ordered the buffalo burger, and I recommend that as well.  The amount of options on the menu are endless, and that's what I really enjoy about this place. If you're looking for healthy/gluten free/vegetarian options, they have them. If you're looking to completely pig out, they got you covered there too. Kind of reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory menu, but much simpler to choose from.",

He was very informative  in explaining info to the friends that are new to BJ'S. All 4 of us ordered the prime rib. A little to fatty but was good just the same. Prepared the way everyone ordered.

The server was very nice and accommodating, and despite the place being full, the food came out quick.  We started with the cheese curd, which were good and then had two types of pizza, if you like sauce get extra, but I thought both were good. Thin crust is good for 2 people with sides, deep dish medium could feed 4. We also got a beet arugula salad and couscous mac and cheese to try, both were good.  Tuesdays was $3 pizaookie, we got the monkey bread and chocolate chip....omg amazing!!! Overall really good experience. The price was about $60 without tip, but we were all stuffed and had pizza to take home.",

    "text": "Service at this restaurant was pretty good. I was greeted at the door each visit. The waiters were fairly attentive due to the amount of traffic was there. Food took a little longer then I expected. But again I do not fault them because of how busy they were.    During my first visit I order the Jambalaya. I was not a fan, the seasoning taste very generic, and the shrimp tasted as if it was quickly boiled rather then grilled. Which was to be expected when ordering a dish that requires a multitude of seasonings and spices. All of which I do not fault on their behalf due to this dish difficulty. Though priced at $18.25 I did expect a little more.   My second visit I ordered the Root Beer Glaze boneless wings. Which was excellent. The sauce that was used had an even balance of sweet and tangy. And the wings were were still crispy even though it was covered in sauce. Priced at $11.95 you will receive a substantial amount of wings for either a shared appetizer or a single entree. A friend of mine ordered a personal pizza which I a had the opportunity to taste. The pizza was perfectly sauced and cooked to perfection I highly recommend.   My third visit I order the Fresh Atlantic salmon it came with a side of broccoli and rice pilaf. It came with the option of boiled or blackened. I decided to get mine blackened. It was a descent dish, everything complemented the other well. The lemon butter add to the salmon gave a citrus accent to the bitter salmon. The broccoli and rice was good though I expected a bigger portion of rice being priced at $19.25.   For desert I order a chocolate chip pizookie which was free due to me downloading the app and becoming a rewards member. I highly recommend getting this dessert.  All in all this is a great restaurant for bar style foods with pricing more so on the high end considering it's portions. I recommend going but keep in mind that this is still a chain restaurant, apart from its extravagant multicultural menu.",

I have always been a big fan of regular French dip sandwiches, but never came across the turkey version of one until bjs.  The turkey is incredibly tender and the onions and horseradish blend perfectly together for an incredible flavor.  On top of the great ingredients, they use a great bun which holds up to the ingredients, as well as the dipping into the turkey au jus.",

We were surprised that there was still quite a line at that hour and we were quoted 15 minutes until seated.  I was frustrated because I was starving and I told my SO that even if we get seated it's going to take forever to get our food because the restaurant holds a ton of people and it was packed!    I can say I was completely wrong; we were seated quickly, our orders taken promptly, and our food came out one after the other (appetizer, then salads, then entree).  We hardly waited at all, yet our food was fresh and piping hot.  We got the provolone sticks appetizer, which was a bit pricier than I'm used to. Well, that's because there were 8 sticks to an order! They were hot and delicious and the homemade sauce was tasty.   I got the gut-busting Baked Ziti and it was delicious, but definitely a guilty pleasure!  My SO got the small deep dish pizza and it was still too big of a portion; one person should get a 'mini', especially if you order a side like a salad.   I definitely enjoy coming here. It's kinda like the Cheesecake Factory in that they have a TON of different menu items - all are unique and inventive. They also have a large beer selection (including their own recipes) if you're into that sorta thing.   I also suggest trying to hold back just a bit to save some room for dessert because they have warm deep dish cookies & deep dish monkey bread that is to die for.   Next time you're at the Village, give this place a try. EVEN if you see people waiting to be seated, they will surprise you with how efficient they run the restaurant.",

    "text": "I felt like I was being punk'd. My friend wanted to take me to her favorite restaurant. Now I think it will be a long time before either of us returns. Granted it was busy Sat. night. They  brought her drink 5 mins before mine. The runners brought her salad but totally the wrong the for me and I had to wait for them to bring out my salad and fries. Fries were borderline warm and hard and I had to wait for the mayo I asked for, By the time I got that they were a loss.  The waitress had a good excuse for not bringing the mayo tho as she was so busy fixing our salad orders.   I ordered a santa-fe salad with dressing on the side as I have food allergies. The salad came an unlisted seasoning powder all over the salad. I had to send it back. It was also missing the avocado and had very little cheese.  I was already a little peeved as I could not eat any of meat add ons and they insisted on charging full price. I had them bring the meat separate so that my friend could add it to her salad and it's a good thing they did.  Her salad was missing the chicken that was to be on it. She ordered the asian chopped salad that was not chopped. Along with missing chicken, it also was missing almonds, mandarin oranges and dressing!  Close to 2 hrs and a talk with the manager resulted in new salads, (mine still had very little cheese or avocado) and new fries which were not much better hot as they were greasy and had a funny coating on them.   As a side note: I disliked the ambiance. It was loud loud loud and so crowded that the twice I had people knock into be trying to pass.",

This receives a 3 star because it's a generic chain. It's not that I don't recommend it but if you're looking for a burger, beer, mahi mahi tacos, giant salads, or some decent entree - this place is on caliber with Cadillac Ranch. If you dig that kind of place - you'll love it here!",

However, we have been here 3 times since they have opened, and the service is horribly slow, each time. They also are not a participating location for a number of the offers that they app offers.   This place has potential, I know it is a relatively new location, but the staff needs some serious additional training or enforcement by the manager.   I'm not writing this location off, but I hope they get the service figured out.   Also beware, the floors are crazy slippery, and that is when they are dry,",

    "text": "This was the 4th time we've been to BJ's and this place continues to disappoint.  Previous visits have been passable or just so-so.  Tonight can only be called terrible.    Here's why...  First, there is an exceedingly long wait just to get seated.  Tonight took about an hour and a half and using their app to get a place in line is useless.  The BJ's app only puts your name on a list at the door but does not secure a spot in the queue as does restaurant's that use the NoWait app.  The long wait might be understandable if BJ's was a unique place to go but it's not.  There are several craft brew places that serve food around the South Hills with new ones opening all the time.  There are a lot of choices available out here offering the same repertoire of food and drink.  Secondly, the time it takes to get your food after ordering is ridiculously long.  Our order wasn't complicated.  We didn't order appetizers or adult beverages, only the entrees.  It took approximately 45 minutes to get an order of Fish Tacos and Fish and Chips.  The waiter was apologetic about the delay and sent the manager to the table.  We hadn't complained about the wait but the waiter realized it was excessive.  Maybe chewing the ice cubes from our drinks while tapping our fingers on the table was a clue?  When our food did arrive, it was lukewarm at best.  The wilted lettuce garnish leads me to believe it had sat under a warming lamp for a while.  I was highly unimpressed.  To make up for the delay in getting served, we were offered a comp dessert, their \"Pizookie.\"  We weren't expecting that and thanked them.    And we started waiting AGAIN!  Finally, after waiting another 15 minutes for the \"Pizookies\" to arrive, and they never did, we got up and left.  I don't get how it takes that long to put a scoop of ice cream on a cookie.  I guess I'll never find anything out.  Thankfully, we could pay the check electronically.  I would not have wanted to see how long it took to get our bill but I'm sure that is the one thing you'll get quickly.  So with the long delays in getting your food, it's no wonder why it takes so long just to get seated.  These delays essentially blew the rest of the evening as we were there much longer than we could have imagined for what was \"bar food\" where the quality is concerned.    We won't be going back and if you are on a schedule, as going to dinner and a movie, go somewhere else or you'll be really late...",

    "text": "I'm not a giant fan of chains, especially places like this where it is always busy and everyone is either frazzled or waiting for food. But the staff at the SHV BJ's Brewhouse keep things under control with ease and calmness. We've been to the location countless times before and there is rarely an issue. My favorite is the California chicken club sandwich, but the deep-dish pizza is always quite good, especially when it's half off on Mondays. But this place has a giant menu. Very little of it is health food, but you sort of know that when you walk in. They have lots of great beer on tap and even house-made sodas. Their signature dessert, the pizookie is also worth a look. I got a free one for signing up for their loyalty program and haven't looked back since.  The reason I chose to leave a review today is because there was a problem with our order. A friend and I had some substitutions. Manager Audrey  came out and immediately made things right and held a conversation with us like we'd all been friends for years. The bill was properly adjusted and our replacement food was out in no time. Because of Audrey's friendly and professional attitude, we didn't even mind waiting a little longer. Props also go out to waitress Tawnya, who handled the situation calmly and professionally too.   It's a 5-star review because I've been to many restaurants where when a problem occurs, the staff handles everything in a lousy way. But the people at this BJ's want you to walk out happy. And you do.",

    "text": "Friday night we hit up BJ's Brew House. Sometimes you just need a beer. We arrived around 6PM and put our name in. We were told it would be about an hour wait. No problem.  We headed to the bar and ended up standing and having a beer until a seat had opened up at the bar. We ended up just staying at the bar and eating as we were both hungry and generally just wanted to unwind.  I had the Tatonka Stout which was a really nice beer. BJ's brews a pretty solid dark beer that's actually not overly bitter, but still has some flavor.   For an appetizer we shared some of the boneless wings. Theirs are actually pretty good and not over cooked. Sometimes restaurants just fry the life out of them.   By then we were on our second round of beers, and I had their other dark beer the the Nutty Brewnette which is pretty damn refreshing for a dark ale.   We ended up sharing a medium BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza. Everything on the pizza was great. Crust tasted good, veggies were fresh, wasn't greasy at all, but it was dry. Dry as a bone. It was desperately in need of some sauce. It wasn't as good as the pizza we'd had there when they first opened, but it was okay.  We ended up having another drink and headed home after that. Would I return to BJ's for a drink and food? Sure. We had a good time. I'd just make sure I asked for a little extra sauce on the pizza next time.  By the time we were leaving, about an hour and a half after we'd got there I'd received a text stating our table was ready. So if you plan to check it out, plan to wait.",

    "text": "Really - this should have 1.5 stars, but I can't figure out how to make that happen.   Wow, I thought this place had a ton of potential, but it didn't deliver at all. Almost everything that could go wrong did. Orders were wrong or missing altogether, completely inattentive servers, non-existent manager, long wait for everything!   They don't take reservations. So our very large table (family event) had to wait a while (hour). No big deal. We got drinks at the bar and all was well.  The wait was the most pleasant portion of the meal. I liked the cider - crisp and just a little sweet, but very drinkable.  It is the only thing that would round this up to 1.5...  When we were finally seated, someone came over and got our drinks.  We waited a while longer and finally were able to place our orders for appetizers and the rest of our food - and a request for napkins & silverware.  Following another long wait, the apps came.  Our \"queso\" dip (really just nacho cheese) wasn't very warm and neither were the chips, but it was fine and at this point, we were so hungry it didn't matter (it had been about an hour wait to sit down).  We still didn't have napkins or silverware and had to flag down multiple servers in our attempts to get these essentials. They finally bring those out after the salads (and our 4 request/reminder).   Now came another long wait (hour)... eventually, runners started bringing out our food, one by one.  Almost everyone had their food (except for one of my cousins - more about that later) and had started eating.  I flipped open my veggie burger.  And there is bacon on it.  I've been a vegetarian for about 3 years now and definitely didn't order bacon with my veggie burger.  I did however order avocado, which I never received.   I decided to eat a fry since I obviously was going to need to talk to someone about my burger - the fries are cold. My cousin next to me had ordered fries as well, but didn't get them at all - so I shared my giant portion of fries with him.  I never received any condiments (ketchup, mustard, etc) nor was I able to ask for these as the servers appeared to be actively avoiding our table.   After waiting and being ignored by multiple members of the wait staff, I decide to make a bad decision and try to remove the bacon from my burger - so off goes the cheese as it has melted together - and I hope that's enough to keep me from getting sick (I'm a vegetarian for health reasons).    Across the table from me, my cousin (who I mention before) ended up waiting 40 minutes for his food after the rest of the table received theirs.  That only appeared because we finally were able to flag down our waitress.   I was able to mention my issue with the bacon to her - her reaction was that it wasn't that big of a deal (vague \"oh, I'm sorry\" was all I originally got), but eventually decided the right thing to do would be to comp my meal.  They did offer to make me another one, but I just didn't want to wait another 45 minutes or so, since the first one took so long!   I never was able to speak with a manager nor was one offered (to be fair, I didn't explicitly ask for one either). I just wanted to be done.  It's a shame - my family only gets together about once a month and we spent most of the time talking about how bad the service was at this location of BJ's.",

We had ordered spinach and artichoke dip for the appetizer, and it came out freezing cold. After our waitress finally came back to check in, it was corrected, and we ordered our meals. I ordered an ahi tuna salad without the wasabi or onions. Almost 30 minutes later, our food finally came out, and my salad, of course, was covered in onions and wasabi. It took about 10-15 minutes for our waitress to check in on us again to discover the error, and it was another 15/20 minutes before the corrected salad came out; after my friends were already done with their meals. And the salad was terrible - no avocado, saturated in dressing, and the tuna was low quality.   We had signed up for the app, so got a free pizookie - ANOTHER 10 minutes after we said we'd be ordering the pizookie to-go, the waitress finally took the order. Then ANOTHER 15 minutes later, the pizookie finally came out.... not to-go, and again, our order had to be corrected.  In the end, only the salad was taken off of the bill and apologies were not offered. I started the night with patience - I get that it's St Patrick's Day - but literally EVERY COURSE was messed up, and the staff was inattentive. That's just unacceptable. I will never be going back, and I suggest others avoid it.",

Food arrived quickly but were served cold fries and the bacon on my girlfriends burger was barely cooked and cold to the touch. We notified the waitress who informed us to set them off to the side.   Five to seven minutes later,  a manager arrived with fries and condescendingly asked if it wasn't up to our expectations. Girlfriend explained and he attempted to tell her it was because they sit in a steam tray (all while speaking in a tone as if we were 5 year olds). I later ordered an amber lager and was given a pale ale. Avoid this place and spend your money elsewhere. Overpriced, mediocre food with poor and condescending service.",

Not only was the waitress unattentive but we also had 8 other staff members bringing our items and when we requested something they would relay the message to her and we would wait FOREVER for our drinks.

Did not time it, but was more like a fancy restaurant. Had the Shrimp tacos that have chipotle mayo and some sort of dressing with Napa cabbage, red onions and supposedly cilantro. It come with an avocado cream sauce, fire roasted tomato sals and tortilla chips.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, warm and tender but there was little taste to the sauce or the taco.  Was looking for some of the cilantro flavor and it was none existent.  The tortilla chips were pretty good but was not a fan of the fire-roasted tomato salsa since it just tasted like smoke.  The avocado cream was OK but I wish it had a little richer avocado flavor.   My associate had the Jambalaya and said it was very good and something he had on a previous visit.",

We had several managers check on us throughout our time there. They have a pretty big menu, so it was hard to decide what to order. I opted for the Gourmet Five Meat pizza. It comes with meatballs, pepperoni, oven roasted ham, smoked bacon, Italian sausage and Parmesan cheese. I had them hold the meatballs on mine. When I tell you this pizza was EVERYTHING!!! It was so good! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. After I enjoyed my pizza I had a root beer float...it was okay. I cant wait to go back!!",

The waiter came by MY TABLE and had the AUDACITY to ask if any of us had ordered Sierra Mist. Who the hell does he think he is? Why on earth would I have Sierra Mist ON MY BIRTHDAY. I was so upset I cried. The tears rolled down my cheek into my pepsi, adding a salty and sad flavor. Then a waiter came over and hit on my sister. I was livid. He touched her shoulder and even gave her a kiss. Shortly after I realized it was my sisters boyfriend, so it was all good. The food was tasty. I had chicken Alfredo that had broccoli in it. My taste buds rejoiced after every bite. It was incredible. I thought of all the good drinks that go with Alfredo, and Sierra Mist isn't one of them. It's just a shitty version of Sprite. The restroom was very nice and sanitary. I went in there to get away from my mom yelling about politics. She screamed \"FUCK TRUMP\" as she downed her 9th glass of wine. I would recommend going here, but only if you will be VERY CLEAR about what drink you will be ordering.",

The service has been fantastic and the food has been stellar. If you are a beer drinker this is the place you should check out, so many different ones to choose from. They have a very lengthy menu.  There is definitely something for everyone on there.  We have tried the cheese curds twice (perfect little morsels of cheese, deep fried to perfection), the honey siracha Brussel sprouts (fan freakin tastic deep fried Brussel sprouts), turkey dip sandwich (thanksgiving stuffed in a hoagie roll complete with a chicken broth dip) sweet potato fries (nice change from regular fries) southern comfort fried chicken sandwich (juicy tender chicken breast sandwich) fish and chips (4 huge pieces of fried fish with a side of fries) hickory brisket burger (juicy, full of flavor, bbq goodness), peanut butter and triple chocolate pizookies( who doesn't want a ginormous cookie topped with ice cream and drizzle with sauce??) The food has really been stellar at this restaurant and the portion sizes are very generous.  Love it, will most definitely be back. 10% military discount. Thank you!",

I understand it's the holiday but I wish they have a better system of making a reservation ahead.

My friend tried the mahi-mahi tacos and she liked that a lot too.   I'll have to come back on a better day when they're not super busy.

I know that's not what you think someone would recommend from a pizza place, but the chicken in it is so well prepared and the dressing and mandarin orange slices make it pretty perfect.  The salad and pizookie were still wonderful, as was the rest of the food our party ordered. I'm sure their pizza, sandwiches, and appetizers are all still really good here. If it were closer, I'm sure I'd go more frequently.   The cider they make was very good, as were the beers ordered in our party.   There's no sign that faces the street, but BJ's is the red building up and to the left of Bonefish as you're looking at the buildings from 19.   It's a small restaurant, so signing up for their app (which gives you a free mini pizookie your first trip and other rewards) allows you to get in line before you get there, which is probably a good idea if you go at a normal meal time.",

Unfortunately when you try to do everything nothing is done well.  The food was mediocre, service was normal.  Won't be back.  Burgers are about 13.00 as are sandwiches.  They were out of the entree specials which were a slice of prime rib for 26$ or a pork chop for 17-19$.",
