    "text": "I'm surprised by all of the not-so-great reviews about Hyde Park because every experience I've had here has been top notch. I've also had the opportunity to dine for both a work function and dinners with family and friends, so that is speaking from both avenues. First, Hyde Park offers their valet service which is great, especially on game days and concert nights when it is a lot more difficult to find a parking spot. The bar is very separated from the rest of the restaurant which I think is a plus because you don't have to be overdressed to dine here by any means. On game days, I've even come in jeans and a jersey and fit right in with the number of other people wearing jeans and jerseys as well. When you dine here, expect to see a diverse amount of people...a lot of businessmen and also those out celebrating a special occasion or just having a nice dinner out before a Steelers or Pirates game.  A great time to come to Hyde Park is before 6pm when they offer their early bird menu. It is around $20-25 (and the twin filets are included), and comes with your choice of salad or soup as well as a side. For as great of food as this place has, it's nice that an upscale place can offer a menu as such. The Lobster Bisque soup is very tasty as well as the bread basket selection they bring right away to the table. The Hyde Park wedge salad is a fairly huge offering of salad and not a bad option either. I'm not a fan of iceburg lettuce, so I prefer the Lobster Bisque soup.  I've tried a variety of things on the menu, including the salmon, filet, and hamburger, and I have never been disappointed.  The steak is always cooked to your liking and prepared very nicely. My personal favorite is the salmon, and this is even prepared to your liking as well. The sides are for sharing, and the potatoes gratin are always a good go-to for me.  Dessert is fantastic, but by the time dessert comes around, it seems like everyone is pretty full. They have a lot to pick from, including fruit type offerings, cheesecake, and chocolate cake.  The one thing I will say about this place is that you need at least 1 1/2 hours to eat here if you're planning on having more than one course. The service is wonderful, but they really walk you through every part of the meal, and this also means, like I said, by the time dessert comes around, you can tell everyone is slowing way down.   The manager did hand out 25 dollar gift cards to use for a return visit which was really nice, too! Also, this is a great place to have a meeting, or a larger party.",

    "text": "I came here one weekend with a group of friends to have a nice dinner, and I was impressed.  We had two waitresses, which was kind of odd to me, but they were very attentive. They explained how all of the steaks could be prepared, the specials for the day, and answered any questions that we had.  I had the lobster bisque to start, and it was very smooth and creamy--very good. I thought the color was strange, though. It was bright orange, kind of like nacho cheese, but it tasted just fine.  For my entree, I had the 7oz filet that was cooked in garlic, peppercorns, and roasted shallot cabernet butter. I think it was called the \"Hines Ward,\" but I can't be positive, and Oo the side I chose green beans. Everything was REALLY good, and I was full without being stuffed.  For dessert, my friend and I decided to split the carrot cake. For anyone who decides to order the carrot cake or the chocolate cake--BE PREPARED. You will get a full quarter of a good-sized round cake. IT IS HUGE. One \"serving\" is enough for four people, I'm not kidding. Three of us had a good helping at the restaurant, and took the rest home, where it gave us three more helpings. The cake is only $10, also, so it's definitely the most bang for your buck.",

The wine that Eric recommended was outstanding without being overly expensive.   The \"Colossal\" Lump Crab Cocktail, Blackened Scallops and Calamari were perfectly cooked. Our favorite had to be the Blackened Scallops.  Our steaks were perfect.  Just the right temperature and seasoned just right.  Two of us had the Filet Mignon and we both were very impressed.  The sides, Sauteed Mushrooms, and Asparagus with Bearnaise Sauce were great.  I highly recommend the Hyde Park Steakhouse for a special meal with friends or that special someone.",

We had 2 servers, which not sure if this was a common practice - but we certainly did not get twice the service.    There was a great deal of pomp surrounding ordering and napkins, etc...but some basics fell apart.  We had to beg for an extra napkin, when they cleared plates for salads/apps - we had to ask several times for replacement forks/knives with our entrees. Getting refills on drinks was also a challenge.    For the entrees, we all ordered some version of steak.  And they were wildly inconsistent in their done-ness.  Medium rare looked completely different on 3 different plates.  We did send one back (a rarity among my friends) that was way over done.  All that being said, my steak was good (ordered medium). The sides were pretty good - standard stuff for a steak house....asparagus, potatoes gratin, sauteed mushrooms, fries.  But, for the cost it was not worth it.  Fine for a work dinner or if you're in town for a game and don't want to leave the north shore (snooze).  Otherwise, unlikely that I'll be spending anymore of my money there.",

Along with brussel sprouts and asparagus everthing was cooked to perfection.  Its a little pricey but the service was top notch.   Very rarely do i order dessert but i made an exception when i seen a piece of carrot cake come out the back.  So i ordered the colossal red velvet cake and i must say colossal describes it perfectly. It was literally like they gave me a whole top of a wedding cake.  Its was so good im mean so so good.  I was with 3 people and all of us couldnt finish one piece.   I would definitely stop back there anytime i want a steak as big as my face lol. And especially if i was trying to impress a lady friend.",

We had bacon wrapped scallops for and app which I would highly recommend.  For my dinner portion, I had the salmon which was delicious and a huge portion.  All the men in our party order steaks and they all raved over them.  Dessert we order keylime pie and carrot cake.  The keylime pie was delicious and meant for 1 person.  The carrot cake on the other hand was huge more like a half of carrot cake. The menu said good for 2-4 people but we shared it was 5 and still had left overs!",

Pros -Great atmosphere -Great service, the manager gave everyone a 25 dollar gift card to use upon returning. -Great menu -Steaks on par w/ other area steakhouses (Morton's, capital grille, etc).  Cons -We both thought the fried onion straws that came with my steak a little on the salty side and the sauteed spinach was wayyyyyy salty.   All in all, good place to curb a steak craving.",

Sometimes you find a place with great food and crappy service or great service with OK food . . . but NOT at Hyde Park - we go both!!  GREAT service and ridiculously delicious food.  We are here from out of town so Hyde Park was a special family night out and as soon as we got out of the car at valet our wonderful experience began.  The restaurant itself was very posh and swanky looking & feeling inside, we got seated at a really cool spot and the waiter came over to introduce himself, Tim!!  Tim was remarkable in his service and was very personable with our whole family.  The manager came to our table at the beginning of the evening to introduce himself also.  We ordered steaks and the surf and turf . . . NICE sized portions of both the lobster tail and steak and everything was cooked to perfection.  Tim was attentive the entire evening and made sure our wine glasses were filled at all times.  :-)  Although we are visiting from CA and unfortunately have no Hyde Parks there (yet) we will be back during our next visit.  For the food and for Tim!!!!!",

The onion straws with the steaks are a nice touch.  The potatoes au gratin have tons of onion and would pass on that the next time. The salads were good and huge and can definitely be shared. Pretzel bread was a hit.  Drink and wine pricing a bit better than other steak houses in Pittsburgh.  Service was generally very good. Not a fan of paying for valet parking in their adjacent lot.  When paying these prices, parking should be included.",

    "text": "Eh is major feedback.  I've visited Hyde Park both for dinner and for happy hour drinks.  It wasn't a bad time but not sure that I'd go back.  FOR DINNER: I had a Hearts of Romaine Caesar Salad.  It was fine as fancy-schmancy salads go.  The service was attentive, especially considering that they were packed.  I'd sum the dinner experience up as I don't really have any complaints...butttt I'm not sure that I'd go again.  Meh.  FOR DRINKS: The happy hour cocktails range from $5-7.  There was a nice variety and $7 for a Cosmo with Kettle One is a fair price.  I also had two glasses of the Kentucky Lemonade, made with Bulliet.  Now, I've lived in the South so I have a STRONG opinion about bourbon lemonade (get it, strong).  The first round was perfect--just the right balance of sweet vs citrus and lots of whiskey.  The second round was made by a different bartender who was no mixologist--it bourbon with a splash of water and a lemon--and I wasn't impressed.  Hmmm.  Very inconsistent.",

I came here after a brutal Buccos defeat and the place was packed...walked in and headed for the bar.  I did notice everyone at the bar had calamari which looked really good and was only $6 bucks...that's a steal a Hyde Park.  However tempting that calamari looked I passed and went for the petit filet, side of lobsta Mac, and spinach/mush side dish.  All delicious!  They do it right here serving the filet with crispy onions.  They don't have happy hour on Saturday but it looked like they have a bar menu with special pricing anyways.  Garrett Jones was up in here mellowed out but one obnoxious drunkard kept bugging him.  Ridic!",

We asked our server to add a couple extra side dishes with our spinach and augratin potatoes so he added some creamed corn and brussel sprouts. Everything was very good but if you like creamed corn - order it. Cheesecake was good but don't bother with chocolate ice cream. Taxi's are hard to come by so call Uber or Lyft for a ride back to hotel if you don't have a rental car. Very pricey, expect about $100/person average.",

Only negative thing is that they design the seafood tower for the number of patrons. We ordered the one for 8 and got charged for it, but only received enough for the four of us. It was still enough. Service was good and provided by Damien. Expect to find only the mucky mucks when you go here. My colleague hung out with the Rooneys the last time he was here.

Lately, I've found that some \"so called\" steakhouses / restaurants in Pittsburgh have a difficult time cooking to a perfect medium rare, this is certainly not the case at Hyde Park. If you are feeling adventurous, I would recommend you to get one of the two dry aged steaks. Easily one of the best steaks you will have the opportunity to eat.",

No biggie but on NYE you'd think they'd be well stocked and it was only 730. At 830 I was told I had gotten the last cider(I had three) needless to say when you go to a top end place you expect them to have the main staples and to run out is a bit of a turn off.

    "text": "Came into Hyde Park a couple of weeks ago, while in town for the Steelers game. For the past few years, this has been my family's go to place for dinner thanks to the great food and relaxed atmosphere!  We started out with the seafood tower, which was delicious and more than enough for my mom and I to split. Everything was so fresh and worth every penny. Unfortunately, our main course came out right in the middle of us eating our appetizer. We sent the food back, since we didn't want to be rushed, thinking the kitchen wouldn't let the dishes they previously brought out sit and try to re-serve them. They did.   The manager was accommodating and apologized for the mistake and assured us they were preparing new dishes and sides. My steaks and my dad's steak were wonderful, but my mom's steak had absolutely no seasoning and was not prepared well at all, which was a disappointment after waiting so long for the fresh dishes to be prepared.   When the check came, we noticed our seafood tower was taken off our check for the inconvenience, which was more than we could have asked for. However, a manager by the name of Ken contacted me the next day to apologize again for the inconvenience and apologized for the fact that my mom's steak was still on the check. He had instructed the manager on duty the night we were in to take the seafood tower and my mom's steak off the check, all of which was way more than we expected or would ever ask for. In addition to his apology, he sent us a credit for the inconvenience for our next visit.   Needless to say, the food (for the most part!) was delicious and the customer service was beyond excellent which is the reason for the 5 stars. Will definitely be making a trip back out to dine again here!",

    "text": "Post Pirates home opener dinner. Very upscale atmosphere Steak House right outside of PNC park. During game days they are accommodating with the dress. Typically dress code would be dress-casual or jacket required. But that is hold to uphold during game days. Which is ok because every patron at the restaurant at the time was in \"team attire\".   With that being said, it doesn't take away from the high end quality of service you will receive. Wait staff is very attentive and well as the bartenders. The lobster bisque is the best I have ever had. For a steak house I actually had the Sea Bass, which was only ok. The rest of the group ordered steaks and said they were very tender and flavorful. In a group of 15, not one person had to send their steak back.   Extremely expensive to eat so be sure to be prepared for at least $80-100pp to enjoy a good dinner and that's without alcohol beverages. Well worth the money on my opinion.",

There was a baseball game going on, so it was cheaper to do Valet for $5 than pay to park anywhere else. We both had a caesar salad and I have never had croutons as delicuous as theirs, fresh baked and so soft. I got the bone in Porterhouse steak medium rare and it was perfection the whole way through. Melt in your mouth and so flavorful. My husband got prime rib with bone in. Tiny bit overcooked but he still liked it. He said the mushrooms on the top were the best he has ever tasted.  We both got dessert, he had \"Moms apple pie\" which he said was ok, but definitely not as good as his mothers. I had Red Velvet cake, the waitress warned me that it served 2-4 people but i still had to have it. She wasnt lying when she brought it out. It was huge. I had people at table beside me asking to help eat it.   Years past we went to Mortons Steakhouse which i loved, and Ruth Chris Steakhouse, which husband loved. Hyde Park is now our place to go.

    "text": "I'll keep this short and to the point... I ordered the 36 day dry aged bone-in ribeye medium rare and the potato gratin.  The steak was cooked to medium / medium well, the accompanying onion strings were overly salty, and the gratin seemed to be missing any seasoning at all.  What they did to that steak was borderline criminal. At that internal temperature it was tough and completely indiscernible as a dry aged piece of beef... the sole reason to order it is to experience a tender, juicy, concentrated beef flavor with a hint of funk. Partly my fault for not giving them a chance at redemption? Perhaps, but I wasn't about to send it back since the wait it took coming to the table the first time around had been long enough. As one of the prime steakhouses in the area, I expect a place of this caliber to be close, if not perfect, on their meat cook temperature. The best parts of the meal were the bread and butter, the bourbon, and the service.  Being my first time here, I was beyond disappointed in the food.",

    "text": "I visited Hyde Park on the North Shore in early October on a Saturday night.  There was a Pitt Football game at Heinz Field nearby so it was busy.  My partner made the reservation and the table we got was very nice.  It was a huge booth near the kitchen.  It offered some privacy and allowed a nice view of the dining area.    The service was fine, not excellent, which was disappointing for such a high priced restaurant.  It was one of those \"feast or famine\" scenarios where we were either being barraged by not one but two waitresses, a water person, the manager, and the hostess or no one was around for 20 minute stretches when it was time to order or we needed something at the table.  My real issue with the wait staff was this: I didn't get that warm and fuzzy feeling from anyone that served us.  It was purely perfunctory service without any real concern for our experience.  It made it feel too \"chainlike\" instead of special which is what you want to feel when you are shelling out $250 for dinner for two.  I know it IS a chain but it should not FEEL like a chain for that kind of money.    I think the staff thought it was my partner's birthday because she sat in the middle of the booth rather than the end which proved awkward later on when they brought a complimentary slice of chocolate cake with a candle (nice gesture but should have checked with the waitress to find out if we already ordered dessert - which we had).  The manager (I think) showed up with the cake when I was getting up to leave for the ladies room and proceeded to present it to my partner.  Don't assume if you don't know would be my advice for them in such situations.   The food was good - especially the corn side and the cheesy potatoes.  The meats were very high quality and could have been seasoned better.  I had the Rooney style filet which was very delicious.  The apple pie dessert with vanilla ice cream was off the chart delicious - they make them to order so they arrive piping hot and crunchy with creamy ice cream melting over it.    I know a lot of reviewers really liked their experience so maybe this was an anomaly or an issue on a busy football Saturday but I do not think I'll be back.  There are too many other excellent steak places in Pittsburgh with excellent personable service.",

    "text": "I can't believe I'm writing a review because I never do this, but I thought it would be wise to let people know of my family's most recent dining experience at this restaurant. To preface this a bit more, my family and I used to come here a few times a year for birthdays, Mother's Day, etc. but we will definitely NOT be back any further.  To start off, we were sat down and then asked to move shortly after because a bigger party wanted those specific seats because \"no other group of tables can be rearranged to fit the party\" and \"they wanted the window seat so the rest of the arriving party can see where they are at\". I was a bit perplexed by this, but the manager apologized profusely and offered us a comped appetizer for the seating change. I didn't exactly believe him but that's an issue for myself.  Now, this is when Pittsburgh really shows its class, or lack thereof. There was a drunk, obnoxious, uncouth woman sitting at a table near us who was literally yelling in the restaurant extremely racist things. I tuned her out heavily because I was disgusted by it, but my family member flagged down a receptionist and let her know what exactly happened.  Not only did Hyde Park's management continue to over-serve a clearly intoxicated racist woman, but they failed as a restaurant to allow someone to disrupt the serenity of the restaurant to the point that MULTIPLE tables were complaining. Later, we learn that the guy she is with IS THE DISTRICT MAGISTRATE IN PINE RICHLAND. So I think it's safe to say, in this woman's words, that if you're \"black, Mexican, or look like Obama\" you should probably stay away from Pine-Richland.  Food was delicious though, as usual. I really enjoyed my steak Lemieux and the desserts were fantastic all around.  If you're looking for a calm and pleasant \"upscale\" dining experience, then you should check out Ruth's Chris. If you wanna hear Pine-Richland's finest get drunk and yell racist obscenities, then Hyde Park will be your go to in Pittsburgh.",

But didn't mind paying for great food and service. If you can afford it definitely go here. Will be back again guarantee.",

My friend ordered a strip, and I ordered the Chef's special bone in strip $20 more. His looked amazing, mine not so much. I asked for a green peppercorn sauce (like au poivre) but was not close. Steak was on the thin side and much waste. My friends was twice as thick.  Shared two sides; lobster mash potatoes- Amazing, and Asparagus- average.  Ceaser salads were really good with new baked croutons!!! Near perfect service! Overall pretty solid.",

Corey could not have been more inviting. He played the hand as a bartender perfectly. He Recommended exactly what we needed after that long day with our family. \"If you ever go there?  Stop and see the awesome staff at the bar.\" We got seated at the best table In the restaurant.  For one, it was a great booth overlooking the whole dinning area. Second, we had the best service ever. Our server Aaron could not have been more professional. Never intrusive or overwhelming. He recommended exactly what we wanted. \" we suggest steak.  Lol.\" We wanted to tell the manager stacy this, but stacy , corey and Aaron needed to hear it from our hearts.  Nice job stacy, Corey and Aaron. We are definitely coming back.",

I was pleasantly surprised that they had Sutterhome and Barefoot wines on the menu. Fancy wines don't do much for me- so I had no problem ordering a $6 glass of white zin.  The bread they brought out for an appetizer was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthebomb.com&s=355187a2a784c6ee933e2e46feb84e4a2bbc84cde0736652fb6961a6a23327f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thebomb.com</a>. They had pretzel sticks in the bread basket. It was like Auntie Anne had made them herself.   We both got steaks with a side of lobster Mac and cheese and asparagus. Everything was amazing.   For dessert we got apple pie and a molten lava cake. The apple pie was made fresh in the back. It took about 20 minutes for the pie, which I assume is because they went to a local orchard to pick the apples before peeling them and putting them into the pie.  TIP: the apple pie and lava cake were both big enough for two people to share.   Overall, if you want to splurge, go here. It was fantastic.",

Split ceasar salad, calamari, and bruschetta flat bread. After getting some wine, bill came to $130. More than you'd expect for happy hour and that little food. Enjoyed ambiance, but no outdoor seating which would be great in the summer. Probably will seek a different venue for next happy hour.",

    "text": "Along with Gandy Dancer in Station Square, Hyde Park is one of my favorite food/drink happy hour spots in town.  Had a really fun time here--much thanks to server Sean, a great guy and great at what he does--last month during a 1-night \"staycation\" at nearby Parador Inn on the North Shore.  Solid happy hour food list and amazing happy hour cocktails.  These days I'm not big on drinking, but because my guy and I were staying in the area and walking/cabbing to our next destinations that Friday evening we enjoyed several of the featured happy hour cocktails.  At $5-7 each and featuring premium ingredients like Belvedere and Don Julio, they were a great deal.  I especially loved the PAMA Blush (Ketel One Orange + PAMA + blood orange).  I almost want to take off a star for inconsistency.  Honestly, there's room for improvement there.  Some of our drinks were on the strong side, others were normal, and none were weak on the booze.  Another inconsistency that stands out in my mind a month later was the cook and juiciness of the cheeseburger sliders; our order #1 was much better than order #2.  The brie and mushroom flatbread we had, though, was so delicious and absolutely some of the tastiest flatbread I've ever had--both orders of it.  Highly, highly recommended for those looking for a jovial, affordable happy hour in a classic setting.  We ate a dinner's worth of happy hour food and had a number of drinks, so the bill was in the neighborhood of $80 but well worth it.  Nothing like the feeling of money well spent.  Oh, and a big \"thank you\" to the table of nurses who shared some of their monster chunk of red velvet cake with us!",

    "text": "I love Hyde Park and I love Pittsburgh Restaurant Week. After dining at HP twice during restaurant week and many other times, one thing is evident: the Hyde Park servers HATE restaurant week. For reference, I dined at Eddie V's on Tuesday night for restaurant week and the service there was impeccable, as usual. I dined at HP last winter during restaurant week and last night (Thursday). The service is drastically different. When greeted at HP, our server made no mention of the restaurant week menu/special. Throughout the meal, she only offered to refill our alcoholic drinks. We had to ask for more water multiple times and more bread. Our servers were nowhere to be found after they delivered our salads. The dessert course took forever to come out, which makes no sense since the dessert is one set item of flourless chocolate torte. When she finally brought the check she never asked if we wanted one check or split, then acted like it was a hassle for her to split it. As soon as we signed our checks she immediately collected them (a huge NO NO) and never thanked us, a goodbye, nothing. The attitude of HP servers is just so evident unless you're dining off the regular menu. Being a regular diner and a participant of restaurant week, I tip according to what a non promotional meal at a steakhouse should cost, but not when the service isn't warranted like it has been at HP. It's really unfortunate that the servers choose to drop the ball just because people are coming in for the promotional meal.",

It had shrimps, oysters, crab legs and lobster tails and tastes good. For sides we shared spinach and mushroom, asparagus, brussel sprouts, corns, regular mash potato, and lobster with mash potato. Loved the brussel sprouts but most of my friends didn't. I ordered a medium-cooked ribeye (18oz perhaps?) but found it might be a little bit over cooked. Though I did not ask to change because it was dark in the restaurant and I could hardly tell the difference by tasting. I also tried some lobster bisque and it was good. Had a chocolate lava cake as dessert and it was sweet. We brought our own wine and it was charged $25. For ten people it cost us more than $100/each with tips and tax. I did have a great time but not for the steak honestly.",

The drink was made with Cirroc Berry Vodka, fresh crushed blueberries, lime and syrup.  It's a good thing I had made a reservation or I may not have made it to dinner. This cocktail was just what I needed and we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.  For dinner we shared a Ribeye, garlic whipped potatoes, and the macaroni and cheese.

    "text": "First off I am rating this a 3 because the food was very good. Although I will start from the beginning. I went here with my family and significant others(7 total) on a Tuesday night with reservations at 6:45 during restaurant week. It started off great, 3 different people came to our table to introduce themselves, while the 3rd waiter explained the menu in very great detail. We then ordered drinks after being seated for about 20 minutes. A couple bottles of wine, and some mixed drinks. We then ordered about 1 hr into being there. There are 3 courses if you want to do the special which we all did. Some of us ordered salads as starters, and the other half ordered Lobster Bisque. About an hour after ordering the waiter came over and told us that they burnt the bisque and did we want salad. At those point we've been here for about 1 hr and 45 minutes with no food. Just bread. No apps, nothing. The 2 bottles of wine were already gone. After stating they length and that we want wine while we have dinner but hadn't even got our salads yet, they brought over 2 more bottles of wine and apologized and comp'd them. Once the food finally arrived everything was tasty. I got a 7oz fillet which was awesome. Other grabbed fillets or crab cakes and everyone seemed pleased. We got a few sides. Mashed potatoes and mushrooms which were also awesome. The food was great. I will probably go back at some point because I do not think what happened will happen again. Were weren't mad, as it is enjoyable to sit and talk to family. I live 10 minutes away and we were in our seats at 6:45 and I didn't get home until after 10. Food is 5* but I think the kitchen and staff was not expecting what was there. The ambiance was very classy, dark, and elegant. Very beautiful.",

We had 2 waiters and they started off on the wrong foot with me by taking over 15 minutes to get our drinks and about 30 minutes until we ordered our entrees. When I finally got my blue moon and my date got his wine, I demanded to put our appetizer order in much to our waitress' surprise.  By the way they have a great wine list but beer not so much. I started with a Greek salad and lobster bisque for my date. Both delicious and the portion of the Greek salad was unexpectedly very large. I had to ask for bread another thing they just should had brought out. They served delicious soft pretzel rolls! For my entree I got the petite filet which was tasty and cooked to perfection. The steaks come with onion straws but we optioned for the whipped potatoes and Mac and cheese as our sides. Both very good but highly recommend the Mac and cheese. To round off the night my date and I shared the molten chocolate cake with ice cream it was decadent! The servers got much better towards the end of the night and our food was brought out very quickly.",

    "text": "Having never been to Hyde Park, I thought that restaurant week would be a great opportunity to finally stop in. Although we went on a Thursday, the restaurant was surprising full. When we were arrived, we quickly joined the rest of our party. Surprisingly, the RW menu in the restaurant was slightly different than what was listed on the website. The postive- more options for appetizers and entrees. The negative - no longer an option for a bacon wrapped filet. I went with the chopped salad, filet with mashed potatoes and onions straws and the chocolate torte for dessert. (All for $35. Not bad!)   We were quickly delivered a bread basket with pretzel sticks, rolls and specialty crackers. Our salads arrived soon after. I was rather confused by my salad. Although it was chopped, it seemed to be topped with a creamy dressing when the menu stated it was a vinagerette. Even more confusing, there seemed to be some stray pieces of what ,the table agreed, was most likely chicken. Was my salad mixed in a bowl that previously housed a salad with chicken? Did a couple rogue pieces of chicken fall into the already chopped and prepped salad mix? We will never know. After the salads were cleared, our entrees quickly arrived. The entire table had ordered the 7 Oz filet with mashed pots and onions straws. The consensious was that the filets were cooked as requested and were tasty. The onion straws were crunchy and delicious but the potatoes were dry and lacked flavor. After finishing our entrees, we were quickly served our desserts. I ordered the chocolate torte. I was rather disappointed in the quality of the dessert. I also tasted hubs cheesecake and both desserts tasted like they were frozen, not homemade. I expected more from Hyde Park. Overall, my meal was rather average. If you are looking for a great steakhouse, I'd suggest Ruth's Chris instead. To be fair, hubs had been to Hyde Park a few years ago and felt that it was much better then.",

    "text": "As a celebration for attaining my MSW, my dear friend Christina took me to dinner on Pittsburgh's North Shore at Hyde Park.  An upscale steakhouse, she truly knows how to make a man feel like a $1,000,000.  We valeted the car, which was strategic in the midst of a Pirate game that was about to start.  Upon entry, the bar was buzzing with excitement for the start of the Pirate game (I believe they lost to the Reds by quite a depressing margin).  Anyway, it was a perfect late spring night that had Christina and I salivating for the meal we were about to enjoy.  A lovely hostess escorted us to our seats.  We were greeted promptly by servers who were eager to make our experience one to remember. So, we started with our favorite drink, Bombay Sapphire gin and tonics. We sipped on them while perusing the menus.  Each entree was named after a sports player here in Pittsburgh (the \"City of Champions\").  We both decided on the \"Hines Ward\" filet, sauteed in heavy garlic and shallots, with a cracked peppercorn coating (added quite the spice).  Christina got the goat cheese and vinaigrette salad to start.  I went with my favorite, the Ceasar salad.  I was amazed at the generous size of these salads for such a fancy restaurant.  So plentiful, crisp and fresh.  Christina and I LOVE our bread (pretzel sticks too) which were accompanied with butter.  This butter was dusted on each edge with salt and garlic/pepper to spread over our guilty pleasure (yes, we asked for more).  I learned that a great red wine can always be relied upon if it's from New Zealand. We enjoyed a wise choice made by Christina that complemented what was about to come.  Our steaks were perfectly timed and delivered by several servers, insisting that we combine the table next to ours in order to create more space (so accommodating). Our medium-cooked steaks were dressed with deep-fried onion crisps. We had the following delectable sides: macaroni and cheese, brussel sprouts, and garlic mashed potatoes.  If you are not hungry by know, then there is something wrong with you. We passed on dessert, as there was just no room. The server packaged our leftovers, suggesting that she split the sides evenly for us to enjoy later on.  This was a first class experience that I thoroughly appreciated.",

Now, I've had experiences here in the past and was totally pleased, however, this time I wasn't impressed.  We sat at the bar and ordered off the happy hour menu.  For the reputation of the restaurant, the happy hour menu was a complete disappointment.  The calamari was rubbery, over fried, and we left a majority of it on the plate.  The flatbread pizza was foul also.  Clearly frozen and heated up.  Yuck!  Drinks were OK, but watered down.  Don't think I'll be back.",

We had called ahead last night to reserve a plush booth in the bar area.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  Service, as always was fantastic.  We had our usual drinks, I enjoyed Cosmo and BJ downed bottles of nicely priced beers.  Since I was pretending to eat light, I ordered the crab cakes appetizer.  Their crab cakes are decent, but it's what they are served with the makes them extra special.  Mine were served with a yummy red pepper aioli and some grainy mustard sauce with a sprig of broccoli rabe, a roasted red tomato and some delicious grated carrots.   Great combination of flavors.  BJ got the a French Dip from the Early Nights menu.  Sliced prime rib with horseradish sauce served on a hefty French roll with fries.  And it came with side and a choice of soup or salad.  He got the half Hyde Park Wedge which is a half of head of iceberg lettuce, tons of blue cheese dressing, with crispy bacon & candied pecans.  This is hands down, one of the best salads in the city.  We both loved it, yes he shared!  For his side he decided to try the potatoes Gruyere gratin.  Wow, so incredibly good.  This is the best side dish anywhere.  And so much for eating light!  After the game, we decided to stop by again to hang out while traffic cleared out a bit.  Since this was an April game, it was a bit chilly outside, so we got coffees with Bailey's to warm us up.  We love everything about Hyde Park, especially the great service!  It's not only a great steakhouse, it's a great place for bar food, too.",

This year for Mother's Day my husband and kids brought me for dinner and it was horrible- we ordered lobster Mac and cheese and there was no lobster in it. We ordered the Jekyll and substituted the oysters for more shrimp and got four pieces of shrimp combined. When I opened the baby sling to place my baby's car seat food fell out of it and medication which means they do not wipe things off. We were told they ran out of desert and we could have a bowl of whipped cream but that's all they had. I wrote into the website and explained the situation and never once even got a response so apparently they could care less. Fast forward to today we thought we will give it another try well it was ten times worse. The service was horrible all they cared about is complaining about how their manager is \" always bitching and on their shit\" They did not want to even try and act like they are employed at a higher end restaurant. The food was absolutely horrible and the presentation wasn't like it used to be. I will never be back again and I am so mad at myself for wasting money the second time around.",

    "text": "As far as steakhouse chains go, this one is pretty comparable to the others. I genuinely don't see much difference between them all, other than Capital Grill might offer a good amount of seafood selections, like this place does and I do love a good surf and turf!   I had the lobster bisque, which was excellent and I definitely finished it to the last drop. I ordered the t-bone steak, and while it was good, I feel like I would have had a tastier meat choice with a filet or ribeye. Sometimes other cuts of steaks surprise me with how much flavor they have, but this t-bone was just a normal tasting steak to me. I loved the brussels sprout side dish, especially with the macadamia nuts. Great addition to the dish!   Our service was excellent, as expected with these types of places. Very attentive and of course the manager stopped by to say hello and ask if everything was okay. This is fancy pants dining after all.   I honestly think it just comes down to location for me. Where do I want to head for a steakhouse, in town or North Shore. That makes my decision. I can't imagine you'd get a bad meal here though!",

For example I have had a medium steak in which very little pink was present if at all (I sent it back, I NEVER do that) but the lady sitting next to me commented \"wow\" and called the waiter over before I even had a chance. I have also seen someone in my party order a medium and it was RARE (not even medium rare). They should really have this dialed in by now. Makes me a little hesitant to order the wagyu!  Other than the temps, I have no complaints about the quality of food or the environment.",

I got an orange-vodka martini which was absolutely delicious (and strong!), not mention a heavy pour! Since were planned on eating out later we just ordered the angus sliders and the calamari. The sliders are absolutely delicious: juicy meat, delicious cheese, and fried onion straws on the side should we have wanted to add them to the mini burgers (and, of course, we did!). The calamari was also great! It was dressed in a savory Thai dressing and mixed with fried jalapenos and some peanuts. I was skeptical when it came out, but in the end it was my favorite of the two appetizers.  The restaurant itself is quite nice. The decor and ambience are certainly slightly more upscale, but there was no pressure to be formal. In fact, I felt instantly comfortable in my jeans, t-shirt, and cardigan. There was also a valet service for $5! We didn't partake, but it seems like a great deal. Overall it's a great place for drinks and apps, and the dinner menu was enticing enough to make me want to return soon! Highly recommend!",

    "text": "First time for me here.  Based on the prices, menu, and atmosphere, I can't help but compare it to the half dozen or so Ruth's Chris locations I have enjoyed in recent years; unfortunately, most of them before I started Yelping. I was invited by some high rollers that come here fairly often so I was the rookie, and overall I wasn't that impressed when compared to Ruth's Chris. This review won't be quite as light hearted as most of my reviews, and I will base my review by comparing it to RC in each category.  Appetizer was shrimp cocktail on a very cool dried ice double boiler type dish that was very appealing but I couldn't figure out how to get any of the cocktail sauce out of the cup other than to double dip after each bite of shrimp! Not a good idea! I had no spoon, and there was no spoon with the shrimp, so it was awkward watching everyone try to figure out what to do.  The shrimp wasn't peeled very well either, but it was huge.  Bummer  Next was the Caesar salad.  It was a nice size serving, but it had no where near enough dressing on it. It was so lacking that when I was done, the plate was dry and clean, you couldn't even tell there was a salad on it!  Bummer!  The dinner rolls were good, but you really had to be patient and I finally had to ask for them, the exact opposite of RC.    Wagyu filet, this was the hi-light of the evening!  It was $70+ and it was great! It was prepared exactly how I wanted it, and I really enjoyed the steak! I was afraid it would be too marbled, but it was just right! I would get this again!  Sides, I had the  grated potatoes and while the flavor was good, the potatoes were really under cooked and were too hard to eat without working to cut through them to spoon them out. Bummer again!  Service was a big disappointment also, you never have to ask for a drink refill at RC, but here you have to ask every time, then you have a fairly long painful wait.  Overall, the staff was professional and well trained, but this just wasn't anything like the experience at any RC I have been to.    I had the 24 ct chocolate desert, and it was nice and rich but there wasn't enough icing to get it sweetened up and compliment it a bit, and the cake, while hot, had an odd texture and I was disappointed in it immensely.  Bummer again!  Over all, you would be better off crossing the river into down town and eating at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.   Sorry guys, I was looking forward to this dinner but it just didn't measure up.   I'm really glad I didn't have to pick up the bill.",

    "text": "This was our first time to Hyde Park. We are frequent customers of the other steakhouses in the city (Capital Grill, Ruth's Chris, etc). We walked in and were told there was a 30 minute wait by a host. Then, the manager came over and said they had available tables. Odd, but we were happy.  The waitstaff was extremely attentive, kind, and knowledgeable of the menu and ingredients. This was great because we had multiple food allergies at our table.  The quality of the food was excellent. The meat melted in your mouth and the salads and sides were fresh. However, the timing of the kitchen was definitely off. Our steaks came out lukewarm and our sides seemed underdone. We had to send our sauteed spinach back because it was actually uncooked on a plate. My husband's bone in ribeye was cold as if it had been sitting for 15 minutes. However, the quality and flavor was still there.   In terms of steakhouses in the Burgh, this is not the best. Still, it is worth a stop if you're at a game or on the North Shore for business.",

We ended up eating here two nights in a row.  Let me start off by saying it wasn't cheap - but anything worthwhile is not cheap!  My husband had the Hines Ward filet and sauteed mushrooms, while I had a giant lobster tail and asparagus.  We took the key lime pie back to the hotel with us for later.  All I can say is this was delicious!  So good that we had the same thing the following night after the Steelers game but added the lobster macaroni.  Quite tastey!!  The place is clean and cozy.  The staff (Tim and blonde waitress - sorry I forgot name) was AWESOME!  Very attentive and everyone had a great attitude!  I recommend reservations as this place gets super busy at night and after games at Heinz Field.  GO STEELERS!   If you don't eat here while in Pittsburgh you're truly missing out on a great meal!  I also understand that sometimes the players go to the restaurant.  We missed Hines Ward by 2 days.  All in all....spend the money, spend the time and have a truly remarkable meal experience.",

My wedge salad was delicious, my steak prepared exactly right, and the mashed potatoes were amazing.  We did not make reservations so we sat in the bar, which was a little disappointing but our fault. It was cold in there.

Okay, I digress... anyways, we went into the restaurant and were promptly greeted and seated. They gave us a nice comfy booth in the middle room of the restaurant (it is huge in this place!) The restaurant week menu consisted on an app, a main entree, and dessert. For my starter, I got the Caesar salad with house made garlic croutons. You can get anchovies by request. For my main course I had the filet mignon and it came with mashed potatoes and crispy onion straws. I jazzed it up and got it Oscar style with crab meat and Bernaise sauce. And for dessert, I got the flourless chocolate cake. Everything was so tasty. The star of the show was the crab meat they put on my steak. They did not skimp on the crab and it was much appreciated. The wait staff was also very attentive to our needs. Overall we had a great evening and would definitely return to Hyde Park again!",

He quickly realized his mistake.   Our steaks were both raw and burnt to a crisp. Burned to bits on two ends and raw in the middle. The real accomplishment is that they managed to also include every other level of temperature within a small piece of meat as well. The lobar tail was horrible. If you'd gone to the docks and licked a live lobster it would have tasted better.  My steak was ordered Oscar Style which is my favorite. Dried bits of crab was all over the plate and there was barely any sauce on the plate or on the crab. Dry Oscar Style is just a lack of caring from every single person who saw that plate in the kitchen.   Dessert was also on par with our main course. 3 chocolate torts that looked nothing alike. The sauces were all at different levels ranging from saturation to not there at all. One of the slices looked as if it had been dropped.   You might wonder why we didn't complain while on site. That would have taken an additional 2 hours as our service was inadequate as well.   A huge disappointment to my boyfriend and his daughter. Exactly on par with my past experiences.",

    "text": "We've tried most of higher-end steakhouses in Pittsburgh and really like Hyde Park. We've been here several times and usually everything is really great, and on this Christmas Eve the food was outstanding as usual. Our issue with this visit was the service. When we go out and spend several hundred dollars on a meal for two, we expect exemplary service and this time it was extremely disappointing.  We were never offered or given a complimentary basket of bread (I finally asked and was brought one mid-meal). We ordered the roasted Brussel sprouts side dish and it never arrived at our table. No one ever checked on us after our food was delivered and when they finally did (near the end of our dinner) I had to ask that they be removed from the bill since we never received them. We were never asked by our server if we would like an additional drink from the bar, even though we initially arrived at our table (from the bar) with drinks in-hand. Service was somewhat slow and inattentive and the overall feel of the night just seemed \"off\" somehow. While some or maybe even all of my \"complaints\" may seem petty or trivial, let me say that I spent quite a few years as a server at an upper mid-level steakhouse and know what makes or breaks a night for a guest. I rarely complain and understand what service industry people go through and how hard they work and that sometimes things just don't vibe. I also tip very generously, especially for outstanding service.  Again, we really love the food at Hyde Park and don't mind paying premium prices for a premium experience. And yes, I write plenty of positive reviews as well, but this particular trip to Hyde Park was a let down in the service department. Still recommended for the food and we'll probably return, although it may not remain our go to for date nights and special occasions.",

They were attentive and friendly. We started with oysters. They were just ok. Not bad, not the best, just ok. I also had the Greek salad. The salad was delicious. It was chopped up like a chopped salad which helped me avoid the awkward wide mouth salad eating situation. I ordered the petite filet medium. It was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. We shared the lobster Mac and cheese. It was horrible! I don't know how you can mess up anything with lobster in it. Oh wait yes I do. You skimp on the lobster! There was also an abundance of onions in the lobster Mac and cheese. I like onions but these were so large and over powering.  It was a good meal but Ruth Chris and Eddie Merlots are still my 1 & 2!",

    "text": "We made a reservation to celebrate our first wedding anniversary during restaurant week. We arrived early during happy hour to check the out the bar specials. We totally recommend those. The drinks were reasonably priced ($5 to $7 for top shelf cocktails and appetizers). The pink grapefruit cocktail was delicious and my husband enjoyed the Hyde Park sidebar. The bar staff was also very attentive.   We then made our way over to the table for dinner. The wait staff was nothing compared to the service we typically receive at the Capital Grille. My husband asked if he was able to substitute the French onion soup for the lobster bisque on the restaurant week menu (both are the same price). The waiter responded that he was \"supposed to choose something from the menu, but could add it on.\" We were charged the full price of $9 for the soup. Not impressed.   My husband ordered the filet medium rare. It came out medium bordering on medium well. We sent it back. I ordered the filet medallions with the Cabernet sauce medium well. The steak itself was very tender, but the sauce was so peppery that it completely ruined the steak. I actually refused to eat my second medallion. I've never done that in my life. The waiters could care less that I sent back 3/4 of an entire meal untouched.   The flourless chocolate torte was also nothing special. The best part of the meal was the King Estate Pinot Noir that my husband treated me to for our anniversary (I highly recommend it if you're looking for a good Pinot!).   Nate, the assistant general manager, was the only person who genuinely seemed to care about our dining experience. Kudos to him for being everything a manager at a restaurant should be. He was working the dining room and checking in with all of the tables.   Overall, we will take our business back to the Capital Grille. Way better than this joint. I actually feel like we've wasted our money. Two stars for the happy hour. We'd definitely do that again.",

My wife ordered the lobster bisque and I ordered shrimp cocktail and opinion soup. For the entree my wife ordered the lobster tail and I ordered the lg mush/garlic steak medium rare. Lobster soup and shrimp cocktail came both pretty descent. Salads came, but I'm still waiting for my onion soup. Waiter finally comes by 15 mins. later to tell me my soup is in the oven and should be out shortly. He also said we never ordered a side (this is the waited telling us we didn't order not him telling us he didn't take the order). 10 mins later, all toll 25 mins, my soup finally arrived.  My wife's lobster was served first and my steak a couple mins later. The broiled lobster didn't look very appetizing. It was tough and rubbery like it wasn't cooked all the way. My steak for being medium rare was dry and tasteless. We had my wife's lobster sent back. They came back with 2 smaller tails with little improvement just a little sweater. Our bill was over $180.00. For that kind of money you would be walking out of there licking your chops and thinking when's your next return (NOT)!",

Prior to meeting them for dinner my wife and I were at the establishment for cocktails (4) and two appetizers. The appetizers were great! Figured we were going to have an exceptional dinner to follow.............NOT.  I followed my friends lead and ordered the filet on bone.............cooked fine.....but really not worth even half of what the cost was! Nothing special about the taste or presentaion.   My wife orderd a Rooney petite filet Medium Rare............came well done! AT A STEAK HOUSE.  The grilled brussel sprouts order as a side were just as bad! How can you serve them undercooked... hard? We have made this at home hundreds of times.....not once have they been undercooked and served hard.  Dessert for me was just as bad. NY Cheesecake was dry and tasteless, not creamy and flavorfull.   Ironically, before going into the resturant we had a conversation about one of her old friends husbands was a chief here. Which lead me to say.....\"you don't need to be a talented chief to work in a steak house....the resturant supplies great cuts of steak .....you just need to be able to cook it to order.\" As it turns out neither thought was accurate for Hyde Park.  For a $300 night out it wasnt worth $30. Next time Long Horn Steakhouse. Or better yet, fries with cheese and chilli at the Rivers and the balance spent having fun with the chance of winning.",

I would not have enjoyed sitting at one of those tables. Fortunately, my wife and I were seated at a table for four.  If you can avoid using valet parking, do it and save $5 plus tip.  I parked on the street around the corner from the restaurant at a metered spot where there is no enforcement on Sundays.  The early nights menu, which is offered all day on Sunday and until 6:00 p. m. other days, offers good value.  It contains a selection of entrees for $19.95 and a selection of those that are $25.95, which I was pleased that the restaurant offered on the final day of Valentines' Day weekend.  All include choice of soup or salad plus side dishes.  The excellent breadbasket included warm pretzel rolls and a large part of butter, part of it seasoned with pepper: interesting and tasty.  There were also good sourdough rolls and a crisp seeded flatbread. My wedge salad was very good as was my wife's caesar salad with fresh anchovies and the salads were a good size.  The entrees were not served hot.  I had dry aged sirloin chopped steak with mushroom sauce, one of the $19.95 items, my wife ordered the two 6 ounce filet entree with bearnaise sauce from the $25.95 menu. My dish was good, hers was not; her filets were inexcusably tough. We sat in front of the fireplace while waiting to be seated as my wife enjoyed am $11 Bombay gin martini: pricey, but potent and well-made. I had a Samuel Adams lager draft beer and was pleased that unlike other steakhouses, there was at least a tiny selection of draft brews here:  Samuel Adams and Guinness. Service from a team of staff members was attentive and gracious.  I appreciated that unlike most other premiere steakhouses in the area, the noise level was moderate, and that unlike at Eddie Merlot's, we were not hounded by a pretentious server who inflicted a minutes-long recitation of every possible dish without regard to whether we wanted to hear it.  When asked if we wanted any additional side dishes, we said no, and unlike at Eddie Merlot's, we were not pushed to order any. The service here was unpretentious.  The cuisine here is not my favorite of the area steakhouses, and the memory of the tough filets will remain with us.  When I made the reservation, I was asked if my wife and I were going to be celebrating Valentines' Day, which we were.  I thought this meant that something special would be offered us, such as the provision of a complimentary dessert, but that was not the case.  I am surprised that the restaurant does not participate in OpenTable, the company which makes reserving a table easy and offers premiums to the diner.",

    "text": "How can I say this without being too critical? Well..I can't! I have lived in Pittsburgh for a little over 2 years and I have to say this is the worst dining experience I have had in Pittsburgh. Here is a brief summary of the trainwreck that was known as Hyde Park of Pittsburgh:  1) We had a reservation for 7:30pm and we were told it would be a few minutes before they could seat us. We were not seated until 8:00 pm.  2) We ordered our dinner at 8:15 and it arrived at 9:15--even though there were people who were seated after us that received their food at least 20 to 30 minutes before us.  3) The food---worst steak house I have ever been to. This place is not even in the same league as Ruth Chris, Morton's, Capital Grille, Smith & Wollenskys, Sam & Harry's or anyother big name steak place you can think of. I had the Jerome Bettis---a 14 ounce NY Strip encrusted by peppercorns. When I got my steak it looked like soup as my plate was COVERED in peppercorns. I couldn't even taste the steak. I actually thought I was going to vomit in a corner of the restaurant after my last bite. We orded potatoes au gratin and creamed spinach. The potatoes were actually very good, however, the creamed spinach tasted like crap--Hyde Park shouldn't even have it on the menu.  5) Service--The waiter was extremely apologetic--and truly it was not his fault. The manager apologized to us numerous times but did not take any of our orders off the final bill. The only thing they did give us was a coupon for free dessert the next time we come to Hyde Park and ordered an entree. Well--we gave away the coupon as I WILL NEVER EVER FREQUENT A HYDE PARK again.  Botttom line - I would rather eat a Big Mac from McDonalds than ever eat at Hyde Park again.",

We started with the Calamari that everyone on here is raving about. It was thin, chewy, and smothered in so much sweet chili sauce that you couldn't even taste the calamari it's self. Whats the point of that? I had the wedge salad which was very good. Then I ordered a Ribeye medium rare. I started into the steak from an end and it was outstanding, but as I worked into the steak it was very rare in the middle, almost blue, and got very tough. Ribeye is a fatty steak, you have to get it hot enough to break that down or you just end up with a big piece of meat chewing gum. So, I ate about half the steak and left the rest. They offered to recook it or give me a free dessert, but frankly I had eaten enough at that point. So, I would give them another shot, but I would definitely check doneness before digging in. I would definitely skip the Calamari. Oh, the garlic mashed potatoes are very good as well, highlight of the meal.",

From the half hour it took us to be seated (with reservations) to the hour it took us to get our order, Hyde Park is a far cry from top notch steakhouses like Capital Grill and Ruth Chris. The prices were average and the wine list extensive with an assortment of prices. Those, however, were the only redeeming features. From start to finish, the meal took 3 hours, only 30 minutes of which were spent eating, the rest were spent waiting for a table or for the food. The steaks were swimming in peppercorns and the creamed spinach looked like frozen spinach swimming in creamy colored water. To make up for all of this, the manager offered us her useless apology and gave us free desert next time we ordered an entree. Right, like I would EVER go back to Hyde Park!  Update: After posting a comment on Hyde Park's website, the manager contacted me and apologized for the wait and the food. A few weeks later we received a gift cirtificate so we will go back and give Hyde Park a second chance.",

We couldn't understand how it could have happened, because we never left the table the entire time there. As we were looking all over for them our waiter came back and asked what we were looking for and said he had not seen them. We left rather disgusted and headed to the concert. The line was long to get in so my husband decided to go back and talk to the manager. He opened a drawer and surprise there they were!  Hmmm...wonder why the waiter didn't check there to begin with? When the manager was questioned how this could happen, he said \"hey I don't trust any of these employees\"!

    "text": "I've decided to write an update and add a star to this place after my experience last night.  I was there for a business dinner with a bunch of folks who encouraged me to add a star and mention each by name, so here I am.  This is a chain restaurant, but a relatively small chain with locations primarily in OH, PA and now FL.  They attempt to compete with the high end steakhouses (Ruths, Palm, Mortons, Capital Grille) and up until last night I felt they were mostly out of their league.  However, my opinion has changed.  We arrived last night at about 6:30 PM.  They have a great circular bar with a few hightops and a deep relaxing red tone to the whole place.  Their wine selection is displayed in the front near a few areas for lounging.  They have a couple of fireplaces and it's a white tablecloth type of dining scene with multiple private rooms.  It's a relatively large restaurant and they also offer valet parking.  In terms of atmosphere it may be my favorite.  The feel is a little different than capital grille which feels \"clubby\".  This place has a less formal or younger feel.  Keith organized us all together and we started with good cocktails at the bar I had a nice ketel dirty rocks martini with blue cheese olives that was served by a very nice and professional bar matron.  We ordered a bunch of things, so I hope to remember them all.  I ordered raw oysters which were served fresh, cold with a nice tasting cocktail sauce.  Tom had the seared ahi, which was good quality tuna coated slightly with sesame seeds and served with a wasabi and siracha sauce.  I think Keith and Lloyd ordered the calamari which was great!  If you can only order one appetizer here get the calamari.  It's lightly breaded served with a sweet and hot light sauce.  The only calamari slightly better in the city is my buddy Ron's at Pangea.  I can't quite recall if we ordered any other apps'.  I chose the lobster bisque instead of a salad and I was hoping it was better than the last time I ordered.  It wasn't.  This bisque was my only real disappointment of the night.  It was too think and the lobster was unnoticeable.  Jim, Matt and Pat all ordered the iceberg wedge which was huge and looked really good.  It's your standard half a head of lettuce served with blue cheese and bacon I believe.  I was really impressed with the entrees' and sides.  They tailor a portion of the menu to reflect a sports theme.  They also serve plenty of steaks bone in which is much more flavorful.  I had the 22 oz. Santonio Holmes bone in Ribeye medium rare.  It was delicious and as good as any steak I've ever had.  The beef was prime, cooked perfectly on an 1800' grille and served pipin hot.  I didn't care for the teeny onion rings on the side but they were easy enough to push away.  Most of us ordered these and were all impressed.  Keith had the bone in strip which also looked really good.  The sides were perfect.  The asparagus was huge and the hollaindaise was not coagulated.  The mushrooms were cooked well and the mashed potatoes were creamy and rich.  There were a few desserts ordered.  I sampled the carrot cake and it was great.  It was easily big enough for three.  I mostly drank the house shiraz all night which was fine and I'm guessing less than $10 a glass.  Overall this place has really picked up it's game and in my opinion can finally compete in the high end steakhouse arena.",

Waiter suggested the rib-eye with the Hines Ward sauce.  Great idea.  The meat was good but not great.  Lots of fat (even for a rib-eye) and the taste was a little on the bland side.  Good thing there was the sauce to go with it.  Sides were very good.  Would probably go back if invited.  If I'm paying I might make another choice.  PIttsburgh finally has more than two steakhouses to choose from.",

    "text": "We had a reservation for 9 at 6:00 on a Sunday after a Steeler's home game.  There was no wait, even though the restaurant was busy.  The wine list was thorough and I saw several of my favorites on the list.  We ordered appetizers, which came in a reasonable amount of time.  I had half of one of the crab cakes - yum! I also tasted my sister-in-law's lobster bisque - it was very good.  The salad came next but not too quickly, allowing everyone to finish their appetizers.  After the salad course, then the main course.  I like my steak well-done and always have trouble because most of the time it is either too chewy or too dry to eat once it is completely cooked.  I had ordered the Steak Dijon (it's called something else on the menu) but it was a 7 oz tenderloin wrapped in bacon and served with a dijon hollandaise sauce.  I have never had a steak that good ever.  It was to die for.  The bacon was cooked to perfection and the steak practically fell apart.  I barely needed my steak knife to cut it.  And the taste?  OMG.  For sides, we had ordered the potatoes gruyere gratin and asparagus.  I only had the potatoes but , wow.  I personally don't care for asparagus, but the comments around the table that it was perfectly done.  After everyone finished the main course, it was time for the dessert.  I highly recommend the Creme' Brulee.  I split it with my sister-in-law and neither of us was disappointed.  All in all, the experience was wonderful.  The service was excellent, the food was excellent, the decor was very tasteful.  I wouldn't take my kids here unless they were older.  From start to finish it took about 2 1/2 hours.  The price?  Well, let's just say that if you have to ask how much something costs, then this is not a place that you can afford.  Definitely something for a special occasion, though.  I would definitely return here!",

My servers were friendly and attentive the whole time I was enjoying my dinner, some of the best service I've had at a restaurant in awhile.  However what makes this review a 5 star for sure was their food! I had the opportunity to try the Japanese Wagyu and I just got to say... wow. I can only describe it as one of the best cut of meat I think I've had in a long time! It should be noted that this was pretty expensive, so what I did was split the order with the group I went with and had it as an appetizer. Hyde Park had a less expensive version which was the Australian Wagyu, which was also an incredible taste to behave.   If their entrains weren't enough, then their desserts sure will! I had gotten the Banana Foster and 24K Warm Molten Lava Cake. I'd say out of the two the 24K was my favorite but the Banana Foster had such an incredible presentation, I'd probably order it again just for the show!  Overall, With incredible service, presentation of both foods and drinks, with incredible flavor to back up their performance. Hyde Park is definitely a place to visit if you're ever nearby!",

I feel like a meal shouldn't take 3+ hours.    Now - let me explain.  I was there for the last day of restaurant week for 6p reservations.  We got salads, steaks, and dessert.    The timing for Sunday night was just off.  I don't know if it was our waiter, the kitchen, or just how Hyde Park was running for the day.  After our plates with our entrees were taken - we waited over an hour for our plates to be cleared.  Then another 30 minutes after our dessert plates were taken to get our bills and to pay.  We had 6p reservations and did not walk out of the place till after 9p.    I have no doubt I'll go back.  We all got drinks, additional sides, etc.  It was not an inexpensive meal.  We all were a bit disappointed with how the meal went.  It is still good food though!",

Both the service and food were really good. The ambience of the restaurant was nice as well & the restrooms were well kept.  For my beverage, I got a dirty martini & was offered blue cheese olives... can go wrong there! As a starter I got the chopped salad, which was just \"ok\". I couldn't really taste the dressing. My husband had the lobster bisque, which was amazing. So much lobster in it. A friend of ours got the baked onion soup and it looked delicious. I plan to try that next time!  As my entire, I got the Chilean seabass, which did not disappoint. I asked our server how he would recommend it and he said Oscar style, so that's what I did. Great recommendation! I wasn't expecting it to come with vegetables. There was asparagus, Brussels, and my ultimate favorite - roasted beets. Everyone else at my table got steaks and said they were perfectly cooked. We did get 2 sides to share, which were the Brussels and the lobster mashed potatoes. The potatoes were excellent! Loaded with lobster... well worth the price. I didn't bother to try the Brussels since I ended up having some included with my dish.  Everyone working in the restaurant was friendly. We were welcomed when we arrived and wished a good evening when exiting. Our server came by our table several times to see if we were okay on drinks and to refill our waters. I was really hoping to have room for dessert as I saw the table next to us with a HUGE piece of carrot cake (menu says it serves 2-4) that looked amazing, I was too stuffed. I took half of my seabass entree home. Another plus is they offer $5 valet parking, pretty decent pricing and very convenient when it's game day.  I am looking forward to me next visit to Hyde Park!",

Last visit, we started with the tomato & mozzarella salad (which had a surprisingly excellent pesto dressing), and I followed that with the 8oz Hines Ward (yeah...), plus sides of asparagus and spinach/mushrooms. The steaks were all very good, although slightly more cooked than I was expecting for medium rare. I might try a different one next time because I was just neutral on the sauce, but overall still very good. We ended with their cheesecake and chocolate cake, both of which we enjoyed as well.  Overall, surprisingly good food, and a good reminder to not judge a book by its cover.",

For food we order small plates from the happy hour menu. I've tried the bruchetta flatbread (so good! I've ordered more than once), the fried calamari (in a sweet sauce that I didn't like. They put the sauce all over the calamari and makes the fried dish soggy), and oysters (dried out and lacking liquor). My husband has ordered the sliders every time and loves them.

The dinner menu had a nice variety. I ended up ordering the Caesar salad and asian style salmon. I found it odd that no sides come with entrees. They are a la carte. Our ground ended up ordering several different sides for the table including asparagus, lobster mashed potatoes, boursin mac n cheese and brussel sprouts. We also each received a sample of the tuna tar tar appetizer. Everything was delicious and my salmon was to die for.  The menu is upscale and pricey. Be prepared to spend a lot. My salad, entree and 2 drinks came to $80. It was a bachelorette party night so I was prepared to throw down cash. I wouldn't come every week but definitely for a special occasion.",

The calamari has changed semi recently to include peppers and it is even better than it was before. The lobster bisque is honestly the best I've ever had. And lastly the steak practically melts in your mouth. Do your tastebuds a favor and head here for dinner one night!",

Though one glass of wine did take a little longer than it should have, but the waitstaff did check on it and apologize.   For starters we split the Capoccio that was wonderful and the Ahi Tuna Tower that is a combo with avocado and wasabi soy lime dressing that was very good. For my main course I had the Veal Chop which was perfectly cooked and just so tasty and tender.  Most others had a steak and everyone was very happy with their meal.  We split a couple of the sides including the mushrooms, potatoes Gruyere Gratin, and the Roasted Brussels Sprouts with a bacon marmalade...all very good and tasty bacon marmalade on the sprouts...yum. Really a good place to celebrate and have top notch service and steak.",

I've been to other steak houses but this was my first time dining at Hyde Park and I must say they are all comparable to each other. I think it just depends on your personal preference and location. I really like the North Shore and think it's a great location. It's also the only steak house/fancier option in the area. We started with the tuna tower appetizer and loved it. It was the perfect size for 2 people and absolutely delicious also something different. I ordered off the restaurant week menu and you can't beat $35 for a delicious meal! The wedge was to die for and full size. My 6oz filet was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. It had amazing flavor! It was served with mashed potatoes and onion straws which I enjoyed but the potatoes were nothing that great and a bit bland. My boyfriend had the lobster bisque and it was also delicious. I will get that next time! When I saw they had green beans as a side dish I had to get them and am glad I did. They were so good! The meal ended with the flourless chocolate cake which was the perfect size. I was really impressed with the restaurant week meal and would totally come back. The wait staff worked together and provided excellent service as well!",

    "text": "Summary: mediocre food hiding beneath tasty sauces.    We were rather disappointed.  The service was great, but the food was just okay.  For the price we expect a lot more.  I started with a glass of wine...with a bug in it.  It happens...not a big deal.  The server replaced it and removed it from my bill.  Next we had the blackened scallops app.  The plate came out with two tiny scallops, each about the diameter of a quarter.  I would argue that they were more burned than blackened, and they were way over cooked.  We complained and the manager brought us a new plate.  These scallops were larger and cooked properly; the vidalia onion sauce was excellent.  The caesar salad was nothing special.  I had the salmon.  It was tasty but slightly overcooked and on the dry side.  The chili soy glaze saved it.  My husband had the Rooney filet.  He enjoyed it although it wasn't as tender as a $48 steak should be.  The lobster on top was overcooked.  Again the sauces saved the dish.  For sides, we ordered the garlic whipped potatoes and roasted brussels sprouts with hazelnuts.  The potatoes were good.  The brussels were roasted whole and were rather unwieldy to eat and lacked flavor.  The dish would have been better if the sprouts had been halved or quartered and then roasted.  We ordered the molten lava cake for dessert.  We joked before it arrived that the cake would probably be overcooked and have no molten lava.  We were only half right -- the was no lava because the center was still cool and the \"lava\" was a solid ball of chocolate.  Otherwise, the cake was tasty, was accompanied by a nice raspberry sauce, and was a much more generous portion than we had expected.",

Thus, a restaurant that's about a 6 and rated $ would get five stars. The same restaurant, but rated $$$, would get 3.   So Hyde Park is fantastic, and I don't have a single complaint. But the bottom line is that it's really hard for a restaurant to get that perfect 9, which is why I can't give it here.  -Steaks were delicious, well cooked, and everyone was more than satisfied. -Seafood appetizer was also amazing- the calamari was presumably fried somehow, but it may not have even been battered, because it didn't feel like it at all. -Service was great, prompt, and came and went at the appropriate time.  I just didn't have that last \"oomph,\" you know? Maybe I just wasn't looking for it in the right place.",

Silly me, how could I not have known that I entered the big leagues when I walked in this place? You're almost bound to see a few Steelers here, CEO's, and other assorted big wigs. So when you want to play in that arena, you better be prepared to pay for it. And at Hyde Park, you do. Really.  Before I comment about the food, I must make a disclaimer that I am not a huge steak fan. I suppose I enjoy a good hunk of bloody meat from time to time but all in all, I typically steer clear. Ha, ~steer~ clear, get it?!  As of winter time 2006-2007, there are really 3 steakhouses in Pittsburgh, Morton's, Ruth Chris, and Hyde Park with the latter being a newcomer only opening in October 2006. So balancing between them, I would have to say Morton's has them beat in terms of steak, but Hyde Park is a close second. Whereas Morton's concentrates on just throwing a prime piece of meat in front of you, Hyde Park likes to dress theirs up in various sauces (mostly butter-based) and give them clever names like the Lemieux, the Stargell, the Rooney, etc.  Where Hyde Park lasso's you in (trying to stick with the whole cattle theme), is on decor and service. This place looks awesome, straight up. Dark woods, big deep red drapes, white table cloths, a fireplace. nice. The place begs you to come in have some great drinks and get your chow on. But the temptation doesn't stop there. The service here is so impeccable that you feel bad not taking any of their suggestions on wine, entrees, desserts, or where the restroom is located. My waiter here was friendly, smart, pleasant, and prompt. What more do you want when you're dropping $60 for dinner (that's for one person, ahem)?  A word of advice, when the waiter brings the check, simply throw your credit card in the binder, tell him or her to add 18%, and then sign without looking at the total. Follow that tip, All in all, and you'll leave here a happy, full person with a great, memorable experience. Until your credit card statement arrives but that's not for a few weeks, right?",

    "text": "Update: With a generous gift card from some kind of regional manager (in response to our comment card from the previous visit), we returned, for what will be my last time.  First, they brought me my steak with the wrong sauce--their pepper sauce instead of the shallot butter I ordered. I sent it back, and they brought me the right sauce--with the wrong steak. Funny enough, it was the same Heinz Ward steak I'd been unhappy with in my previous review.  This time, in fairness, my steak was at least cooked a perfect medium-rare. I'm still unimpressed with the flavor of the meat itself, though. It just tastes a little watery compared to the stuff at other restaurants I've been to.  I had three bites and stopped eating, and I am pleased to say that they didn't charge me for the steak. But again: At a place this pricey, I just expect my experience to be at least an B+, and I haven't had anything over a C-.",

    "text": "Fancy fancy!  La-la la-la!  Come here if you are looking for a special night out!  I was here for a rehearsal dinner and it was amazing.    Our party was held in a private back room.  At first, I thought that the hostess was leading us into the kitchen but after a few twists and turns we entered this lavish red room.  It was perfect for the group of ~60 people.  The bread basket was a winner - there was a soft pretzel in there!  I LOVE pretzels!  Luckily my husband pulled it out of there before anyone else did.  The salad was bizarre.  I decided that I could recreate the recipe: Step 1:  Obtain a head of lettuce Step 2:  Quarter it. Step 3:  Place a quarter on a plate. Step 4:  Drizzle creamy dressing on top. Step 5:  Sprinkle with bacon and pecans. Step 6:  Serve.  Really, do I need to eat all of that lettuce?  Maybe a normal salad does have that amount of lettuce in it and we just don't realize it, but when it is sitting in this quarter-sphere on your plate, you realize that you just need to eat the top layer and that is it!  Dinner was great:  I had the shrimp and asparagus and it was delicious.  The guy next to me had the steak and he was loving it along with the mashed potatoes and crispy fried onions on the side.  Finally, dessert was perfect:  a nicely-sized slice of chocolate cake and three drops of raspberry sauce on the side.  Mmmmmm.",

    "text": "Hyde Park came highly recommended and I enjoyed my steak there. I had the 7oz. Clemente, which had bleu cheese on top and was wrapped in bacon. I then proceeded to have a heart attack...  [Okay, joke in poor taste.]  Upon heart attack recovery, I realized I quite enjoyed the steak. Cooked medium rare is my preferred temp, and the steak was quality, IMO. I'm not a steakhouse vet, however.  We ordered Hyde Park's Signature Mac and Cheese as a side, but I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the signature mac at Aqueous, an upscale steakhouse at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort where we ate the night before.   The lobster bisque at this restaurant is great, however.   I'd likely return here for a special night on the town in Pittsburgh, but I might also choose one of the competitors like Ruth Chris or Morton's, too.",

    "text": "I love the below reviews..... I will give it to you straight and honest. Hyde Park is like Flemming's, Capital Grille, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Sullivan's, etc. It is a high end steak house. So, if you don't want that, go to the burbs and eat Outback.   Hyde Park reminds me of a Flemming's or a Sullivan's, it has that wibe. Big large open space with vast kitchen.   I went on a Wednesday, so there was no wait. The dress is all over the map. I saw jeans, suits and ties, and pants to small for the hostess.   Overall the food was very good. It's better than Ruth's or Morton's, and yes Outback(refering to the dolt saying this below).   You can get a steak anyway you want with any combo of bacon, butter, sauce, blue cheese, ect. It's pretty incredible. They also have high end Kobe beef. Not something you see everywhere.   The sides are also better than Ruth's or Morton's. You name it, they offer it.   My steak 10 OZ Fillet was perfectly cooked to temperature as was my colleagues.   The service was over the top. It was too attentive for a business dinner. Our waitress interrupted us several times, but we always had bread, water,plates cleared, ect.   I have had more bad meals in downtown Pittsburgh that I care to admit. I walked away happy and full like any of the other high end steak houses.",

The wait staff was friendly and helpful, and overall, this place was every bit as nice as other big names in the steakhouse business (Ruth's Chris, Capital Grille, Morton's) in my opinion.  I've also stopped here before a Steelers game for a bit of \"tailgating\" with some friends - we had a great time at the bar. The bartenders are courteous, efficient, and make some nice drinks.  I've read through some of the less flattering reviews, and can only think that these reviewers unfortunately came on an 'off' night for this place. So far, I am pleased, and will definitely return when I am craving a steakhouse experience!",

But the service and Food was **** Star although I would choose Eddie Merlot over Hyde, Ruth and The Capital Grille just on preference of taste! Some food appease certain people's taste buds more than others and their food is splendid also! The Lobster Mac was good but Eddie's is the Best along with how the Steak tastes without the enhancement of Lobster, asparagus added! The Meat was much more dense! Tender and tastier! The Service was great at both locations but Eddie was more Modern and bright compared to Hyde being dark and secretive! It was a nice experience just to say \" I ate there\" - they did impress me at the bar before we ate with a cherry based Manhattan! So smooth, it was a treat! The Apple Pie Ala mode was special also! Oven baked and actually enough for 3. I like Hyde but did not fall in love.",

The chicken parm had an overly sweet, yet bitter sauce (yea, fault one on me for going fowl here) with large, yet mostly flavorless breastmeat. To close, the carrot cake, though gargantuan in proportion size with  six layers of cream cheese frosting and owning a perfect texture and density, was for the most part in need of more sweetness and I actually think a Tastycake would have won on a blind taste test. Sad to have experienced such poor food performance at an upscale locale.",

    "text": "A few times a year I like to go out for a steak.  Since I don't eat red meat that often, when I do indulge, it needs to be awesome.  Until recently, I preferred Ruth's Chris steaks; they're Prime quality, and served in a crock with sizzling butter.  Last night I had the opportunity to try out another Pittsburgh steakhouse, Hyde Park.  Hyde Park is a classy place- dress is business casual; even the wait-staff were dressed impeccably, bow-ties and all.  As I waited for my date, I noticed plenty of professionals, there were even a few Pittsburgh Penguins in the back dining room.  We sat at an oversized booth (great for privacy) and looked over the drink menu.  Our server made several wine suggestions, all paired well for a steak dinner.  While we decided what to order, a warm basket of bread was dropped off at our table.  Along with the bread, we were also served two triangles of chilled butter.  The bread was fresh and yeasty- of particular interest were the large salt sticks; they were slightly sweet and extra gooey... I could have eaten a dozen.  We started off with two salads; the Hyde Park Wedge, and the Goat Cheese salad.  Our salads arrived at the table on two chilled dinner-sized plates.  The Goat Cheese Salad had a thick raspberry-balsamic dressing, huge chunks of fresh goat cheese, and large, whole candied pecans.  It was also served with two crostini.  The salad was delicious; the greens were impeccably fresh, and the flavors were balanced.  The Hyde Park Wedge had  piece of iceberg lettuce, and what had to be  1/2 cup of fresh, homemade blue cheese dressing, bacon bits, and candied pecans.  Not only were the salads delicious, they were HUGE.  I could have easily eaten one of these salads for dinner.  Our entrees included The Colossal Shrimp and Scallop Saute, and Steak Clemente.  Being a bit on the \"almost full\" side, I was glad to see that all items were a la carte.  The shrimp and scallop dish arrived first.  My date said, \"Take a look at size of these scallops!\"  They were, in fact HUGE; the size of a silver dollar.  The shrimp were equally massive, and succulent.  The scallops and shrimp were served over grilled asparagus; a citrusy-butter sauce finished the dish.  My steak arrived looking good.  It was a perfect portion- not too big.  A large strap of thick-cut bacon surrounded the meat.  The beef was topped with several ounces of fresh, melted blue cheese.  The steak was finished with a bordelaise sauce (a French sauce made with marrow, wine, shallots and demi- glace).  The steak was buttery-soft; the cheese, bacon and rich sauce were velvety and luscious.  Although we didn't have room for dessert, we did see a few items that looked good- creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake, and cheesecake were a few of the choices.  In addition to the rich desserts, several after-dinner drinks were available.  If you have a fondness for single-malt scotch, port, or VSOP cognac, you will be happily accommodated.  Hyde Park is a top-shelf restaurant with flawless service and well-prepared food.  If you're in the mood to be taken care of, and are craving a delicious grilled steak, Hyde Park is a must-visit!

My boyfriend got the Bulleit cocktail too and then the Moscow mule, also great. The food was meh. And yes, I know it was happy hour so maybe they're not pulling out all the stops, but Ruth's Chris hh food is bomb. Just sayin. We got the tenderloin sliders and the calamari. Sliders could be good but the pieces you get are kinda small, even for sliders. Calamari was ok. Would come back for the drinks for hh for sure, and maybe to try their dinner menu since they looked good coming out.",

Sits between the ball park and the football stadium and is right across from a decent Hyatt Place hotel.  I was impressed with the city but less so with the restaurant.  We had several appetizers including some big group seafood appetizer served on a tri-level platter.  I had a wedge salad which was excellent and also the salmon, which was very disappointing.  I thought the salmon was dry and almost tasteless.  Others commented their entrees were good so I'm cutting this place some slack but when the check came the servers kept coming by asking if the bill was ready. Come on, I just got a check for almost $900 can you please give me a moment to digest my dry salmon?  I didn't completely dislike it because it had some good qualities but I won't go out of my way to return.",

My biggest reason for 2 stars was the staff. When I came in I went to the bar area and there was an empty glass at the seat I was going to sit in. Justin (maybe Dustin?), an apparent manager of sorts, came over and somewhat dramatically moved the glass and made it known to the bartender that he had to move it. This all caused a chain reaction. I then had to hear the two female bartenders discussing his dramatic-ness. I can't say either lady was overly attentive. They were more focused in cleaning and what I assume are other closing duties. My order was sent to the kitchen wrong but I made it work, I understand errors happen.  I will say that some of the conversation the two bartenders were having that I could hear wasnt overly professional. The one never wanted to work a Sunday again, apparently people don't tip well, another guest left $40 cash, woo hoo, etc. As a bartender I know the ups and downs but you don't talk about tips or customers in front of customers!!!",

I am yet to find a field in which Hyde Park is lacking. The service is impeccable, the appetizers are irresistibly indulgent, and the entrees are prepared with great care and regard for excellence. On my most recent visit, I was pleasantly greeted with a warm smile by a lovely hostess named Shannon. We had no issues booking our reservation and were promptly lead to our dining table upon arrival. Right of the bat, we were treated with a high level of professionalism from every staff member that crossed our paths. Everything was incredibly clean and well organized as we reached our table. After placing our orders, our drinks and food arrived with great urgency. It was a rather busy Saturday night, and I was impressed by how the staff was able to attend to our table as if we were the only ones in the dining room. The calamari was my app of choice, and it was the perfect combination of textures and flavors to prepare my palate. The breading was light and crispy and paired very well with a spicy Thai glaze. I ordered a filet as my main dish. All of our steaks arrived exactly as requested. My filet was a succulent medium rare with pristine presentation and dressed with just the right amount of fried onion straws. Halfway through our meal we were welcomed by a very accommodating general manager named Ken. By the end of the night my entire party was too full to order any desserts, but speaking from the past, I'm yet to come across one that disappoints. The whole experience could not have been more enjoyable, and I will, without any doubt, be returning as soon as possible.",

From the moment we walked in we were treated like second-class citizens. The service was absolutely lousy, the steak wasn't worth the plate it was served on, and it was expensive as hell. When we ordered, they \"forgot\" to ask us how we wanted our steaks cooked. We had to call them over to add that detail, and for the rest of the night they just asked us in mid-stride how we were doing and basically strode off before we could say anything. All the while, the white guests around us were being served faster, more often, and with greater politeness and respect.  I'm not one to dole out accusations of racism, but I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant of this \"stature\" before. You just know it when you see it.   I'll never go here again. I don't recommend anyone else to eat here either.   Oh, and by the way, they put cheese on their Filet Mignon, and medium rare was cold and blue in the center. You should be ashamed of yourselves.",

The grand finale is usually the red velvet cake, when in stock! This massive cake is enough to feed 4 people, we usually take it back to our hotel at this point and need to be rolled out of the place.   Overall, worth every bite!!!",

    "text": "The steak is out of this world.  It's amazingly good and always well prepared.  You can tailor it how you like, and the options are endless.  But, the reason for this review is two fold.  First, the creamed corn.  If you do nothing else, ever, get the creamed corn.  How can corn mixed with baacon ever be a bad thing?  It can't.  It's so good, my wife and I order the sides separately because we each want one.  Additionally, we've discussed stopping by, heading to the bar for a drink and an order of creamed corn.  It's that good.  It used to be seasonal and now it's on the menu all the time.  In my house, that's a great call since we found or way there more often during creamed corn season than when it wasn't in season.    But second, my wife and I celebrated our annivesary there and they went out of their way to make us feel special.  For starters, when I made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything and I told them it was our sixth wedding anniversary.  We showed up about 45 minutes early and the place was jam packed.  The first words out of the maitre d's mouth were not \"we'll call you when your table's ready\", the first words out of his mouth were, \"Oh, Mr. & Mrs. Scotti, Happy Anniversary\" then seated us anyway, much to our surprise.  Then we got to a huge table with rose and candles spread all over our table.  Before I knew what was going on, our hostess had my iPhone and taking our picture in the booth.  Plus, they threw in dessert which was not at all expected.    We really were just lookiing forward to eating creamed corn before a Steeler game for our anniversary and were compeletely blown away.  The food is tremendous, the services is way over and above what anyone can reasonably expect, and to say that we'll be back is an understatement.",

They were not hovering but timed their visits perfectly.  We had salmon, 'Hurdle' steak and 2 chicken dishes.  Sides were spinach and mushrooms, asparagus and the 'to-die-for' boursin mac and cheese.  All of the food was great.  My steak was done perfectly medium rare.  The chicken was crispy and moist.  The salmon was juicy.  Will definitely go back and try something different.   Go and enjoy the food and wine.",

For my Birthday I invite 5-10 of my closest friends out to celebrate my birthday with drinks and a great meal. Saturday Night was that night! We were seated at a comfortable table with an excellent waiter named William. He promptly took our drink orders, and decanted the bottles of wine we brought. At this point our salads and appetizers arrived. I had a delicious Caesar Salad. For the main course, I had my annual treat... The 6oz Japanese Wagyu Strip Loin. This is arguably the great cut of meat ever. The marbling is perfect. When you order this they provide you with all the details about the piece of meat. It basically melts in your mouth. It was cooked rare to perfection. I then had a piece of flourless chocolate cake to complete the meal. Hyde Park proved yet again why it's one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh!!!",

I've been to fine steakhouses before, but I'm always interested in trying new places.  This is a quality restaurant if you're looking for a top notch steak, or other options in a chill, inviting atmosphere.  The 36-day aged ribeye and the 22oz ribeye (served bleu with a creamy bleu cheese sauce on top) were both cooked to perfection. We had a lobster mac and cheese that pleased the palate, and completed the pairing with vibrant asparagus, sauteed with olive oil and parmesan.  My Hyde Park Manhattan was a real treat. Served Up, notes of vanilla, spice, and black cherry crept across the table as it was served.  For dessert, I had the collosal red velvet cake. Truly collosal, it's made in house daily and you can tell. The cake was moist and flavorful, and the perfect balance of sweet and richness. Be prepared to share or take home.  Our servers, Tim and Stephanie were a pleasure. Friendly and attentive, they also gave us plenty of room to enjoy our meals and our evening together.  As I am enjoying exploring food fare in Pittsburgh, Hyde Park was a definite hit. I'm looking forward to returning.",

We ordered our second drink as we were still absorbing the menu. 10 minutes later, we had not seen any of our waitstaff. The manager came over and we told her that our waitstaff disappeared.  Another waiter brought us our drinks.   I ordered the lobster bisque. I found it to be somewhat boring, it was missing something.  We each had a filet. They were OK, not anything to write home about. Both of our steaks were cooked very well, but a bit fatty.   After we finished, we had to wait 15 minutes to see any staff to remove our dinnerware. I was literally calling the manager who had stopped by earlier from the table to see about having out dinnerware removed when they showed up.

    "text": "I stopped by here this past evening for dinner with my wife and two other dining companions.  I have been wanting to come to Hyde Park for a long time but for some reason it never really comes up in discussion as a place to dine at.  Perhaps its because of its location on the North Shore or maybe its because it is not one of the better known steakhouses in the city.  In any case Pittsburgh restaurant week gave me the perfect reason to come here.  The inside of this place is what you would expect from a swanky steakhouse.  Immediately upon entering there is a bar to the left and then to the right is their main dining room.  What I thought was cool about the bar is that it had a fireplace with a few seats around it that a couple was enjoying the night that we were there.  The dining room itself was nice, open and was done tastefully.  Since it was restaurant week I pretty much knew that I was ordering off of that menu but still decided to take a look at the regular menu.  My wife and I were both amused by the naming of steaks and other menu items after local sports stars like Crosby and Tomlin.  In the end I ended up ordering the lobster bisque as my appetizer, a 7 oz petite filet that came with onion straws and garlic mashed potatoes for my entree while splitting a side of the roasted brussel sprouts and hazelnuts with my wife and finally the NY cheesecake for dessert.  Our appetizers ended up coming out with impressive speed and my lobster bisque was decently good.  It was creamy and had a good amount of lobster in it but I felt that it was a little bland and maybe something was missing.  So I ended up putting some pepper into it which really helped out in my opinion.  While we were still eating our appetizers the bread basket for the table came out alongside some butter which had pepper topping on a portion of one side and salt topping on a portion of the other.  The bread basket consisted of a number of pretzels sticks, some flat bread and some traditional bread.  My favorite of the bunch ended up being the pretzel stick even though I had to rub some of the salt off of it.  Our entrees came out to us next and I have to admit that I was pretty impressed with my steak.  It was cooked perfectly to a medium rare and was seasoned nicely.  I also enjoyed the onion straws quite a bit but was let down by the potatoes which were a bit bland.  Our side of brussel sprouts ended up being really good and I enjoyed the pairing of hazelnuts with them which I have never had before.  Finally after we were all done our desserts came out.  My cheesecake was rich and creamy but seemed to have a bit of an identity crisis having some cherries on it but also a raspberry sauce.  It seemed a bit weird especially whenever they clearly had raspberries since that was what topped the chocolate desserts at our table.  So maybe it was a mistake?  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While I thought that a few of the items could use some more seasoning, I did really enjoy my steak which at a steakhouse should be the star of my meal and was the star of my meal.",

    "text": "On a whim, we decided to try Hyde Park, because people rave about it all the time (seriously, ALL the time).  We went mid-week, so reservations weren't necessary.  We were greeted promptly upon entrance and our coats were swiftly taken to the coat check.  The hostess kindly obliged when I asked her to sit by the fireplace, which made me very happy and quite warm.  And that, more or less, was the last point in the evening when I was impressed with Hyde Park.  When it came to food and service, the restaurant left quite a bit to be desired.  Our waitress was pleasant but busy (and consequently very, very inattentive).  And seriously, who wants to spend half of their dinner trying to flag down a waitress for water or wine?  We had the tuna tower for our appetizer, which was sashimi tuna on a bed of avocado.  It was fine, not great. No complaints there.  My real issue was with the main course.  My husband had a steak that he enjoyed. I ordered sea bass in a citrus sauce, which I expected to be pretty good.... Cuz it's kinda hard to screw up fish, right? No, not right.  The fish was overcooked and the citrus sauce barely had any flavor.    So I get that this place is a steak house, but if it's going to charge $40 for a piece of fish, I would (at the very least) expect the piece of fish to be...somewhat tasty. The other two major steak houses both serve delicious fish dishes. Oh well, maybe the chef was having an off night.  Who knows.  We ordered the molton chocolate lava cake for dessert which was alright and then we bounced. (After paying the bill, which was substantial for a mediocre dinner).  Honestly, I don't think any part of my evening would make me feel compelled (or even desirous) to return.",

My wife and I both ordered The Filet Mignon and Crab Cakes. The supposed Filet Mignon tasted like liver and my crab cakes were burnt and full of filler with little if any crab meat at all. We complained to the floor manager and she got the \"Guest Service Manager\" Matthew S. He was very apologetic and took our meals, drinks and desserts off our bill. He only charged us for my shrimp cocktail and my daughter's cheeseburger.   Before today we went to Hyde Park four to five times a year. It's a shame because that dinner totally ruined my birthday.   I'm not sure if I'll ever go back!",

    "text": "Wasn't sure what to expect as heard mixed reviews.  When we first walked in the hostess did not greet us and proceeded to do some shuffling of papers before she would speak to us.  A line formed behind us which I thought was unnecessary.  Could use some improvement in this area.  Had to wait a bit from our reservation time but was offered a drink by a server. The restaurant seemed busy and was really loud.  Was surprised at the clientele's attire.  Everything from shorts, flip flops, ripped jeans, t-shirts to suits and ties, and evening dresses.  We were greeted at our table with an anniversary card, rose petals and a candle; nice touch.  Our waiter was very attentive and the manager also came around.  The food was very good and did not have to wait.  A complimentary dessert was offered that was also really good.  Restrooms really needed attended to as countertop was covered in water and overall the cleanliness was lacking.  Will return as the food and service were really good.   Would hope that they work on that first impression a bit and take better care of the restrooms.",
