The Southwest burrito was almost there but needed something to pull it altogether. The eggs were sitting around or microwaved (sort of tasted like liquid egg or powdered egg), but either way were not made to order. Healthy food can be incredibly flavorful but both of these items just missed the mark. Staff was friendly but they seemed a little distracted by the catering order they were working on - I was the only person in there and it took around 5 min before they even started on the smoothie.",

    "text": "A new \"fast food\" restaurant located on Grant Street is always welcome!  For those of us who walked by the sign in the window teasing of a grand opening for months, it was Super Awesome when it finally happened. I was so excited when it opened that I ordered a salad and a soup, and could not wait to dig in.   In retrospect, $19.00 was *entirely* too expensive for the tiny, tiny portion of salad that was served and the quart of soup. Yes, the salad had a nice flavor... but it tasted like a small salad and nothing more. The lemongrass soup was flavorful, not authentic, and the portion size was generous. Considering I can enjoy a larger bowl of vegetable soup at an Asian restaurant just a few blocks away for almost half the price, jam packed with fresh vegetables, Freshii does not offer a good value there either. The best $12 salad still goes to Bluebird Kitchen on Stanwix or Villa Reale (based on price, quality, serving size, healthiness).  My coworker swore on his mother's grave that the Oaxaca bowl was amazing. I went back for the Oaxaca bowl with chicken later that week. The Oaxaca bowl with chicken was, in all honesty, mostly a bowl of kale (some of it brown and wilted), two tablespoons of rice, a tablespoon of chicken, a tablespoon of beans, a teaspoon of corn, two slivers of avocado, a tablespoon of salsa, and a dried up lime wedge for just under $10.00.  The lovely woman at Sree's will triple the quality, flavor, and caloric intake for $3 less.  We bought a POUND of kale for Ribolitta on Sunday and let me tell you -- the amount of kale in my bowl was about 35 cents' worth AND old. Not to be deterred from making Freshii my new \"Go-To\" destination for lunch, I tried the Oaxaca bowl with chicken again, thinking maybe it was a blip, but had a repeat experience. Don't get me wrong, who doesn't love kale, right?  I also love popcorn but am not going to pay $10 for a small bowl of it.   The employees are very nice, friendly, and I will give credit to management for trying to shepherd customers through the ordering and pick-up process. The layout is strange, but they're making as good use of the space as is possible.   Perhaps I will try again in a month, after they've had some longer run-time.",

    "text": "I work in the Grant St. corridor of down town Pittsburgh.  Our quick lunch options are limited in this area.  If you tack on the requirement of being health conscious and/or the product containing fresh ingredients, the options become even more limited.  As such, when I saw an eatery with fresh in the name \"I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'\".... no really that song was the first thing that sprang to mind.  After that, I realized that we not only had a new option but we also had an option that claimed to be serving \"fresh\" food.  I had to check it out!  Disclaimer, I cannot prove that ingredients are delivered fresh every day or anything like that.  I can say for certain that everything seems to be very fresh.  More important, when I'm done eating their food I feel full in a good way and I stay full much longer than I do after eating at the other local quick lunch places.  This sort of tells me that the food is doing a better job as fuel than other foods.  I tend to order the Mediterranean Bowl with grilled chicken.  This dish is rather large and really doesn't require any sides.  From the feta, to the olives, to the red peppers, to the sauce, to the everything else.... the flavors blend perfectly together.  In fact, it barely needs the  chicken.    In the end, everything that I've had to eat here has been great.  The service is generally really good as well.  In fact the owner is often on site!  The only downfall with eating healthy is that you tend to pay more.  But don't let that stop you from giving this place a try.  Sometimes you get what you pay for.",

I had the mexican kind of wrap -- can't remember the name -- with falafel. So good. The cilantro lime dressing was amazing, the tortilla was fresh, and it was all perfectly wrapped, which was awesome -- I hate when a wrap falls apart.   We came at noon and it took a LONG time. Like 30 minutes to get the wrap. And then halfway through eating it my friend an I both realized we were missing the add on (her chicken, me falafel). I was annoyed because their food is not cheap as it is and it was 2 extra dollars to add the protein. I'm glad we decided to eat in since we noticed while we were still there.   BUT, they are new and mistakes happen, the important thing is how they deal with it which they did very well. The manager offered us three choices -- give us the protein on the side, remake the wrap, or give us a refund. My friend chose her chicken on the side and I asked to have mine remade since I didn't want to upwrap the wrap. She had it fixed within one minute and gave us comp cards for a free meal. Awesome customer service.   I can't wait to go back but next time I'll probably make a point to show up at 11:45 or 1pm rather than right at noon with the downtown lunch crowd.",

With extra tofu and falafel balls. The taste was just OKAY! There was more rice than actual beans and veggies. Like a thin layer of beans corns avacado cherry tomatoes that's all! If it was not for the extra falafel balls I don't think so I'd like it at all. The cafe is beautiful and in downtown. Friendly staff. Overall okay place can stop by for a quick bite.",

They pre-make them (but they aren't old), which is nice because you don't have to wait nine hours for a juice to appear and get in your belly.  Also had the lemongrass soup with vegan broth and tofu.  Had rice noodles and plenty of veggies.  Quite tasty and had a nice spice level.  Added some sriracha for extra oomph.  Was very filling, but calories were actually pretty low--like 500 for everything.  Price was maybe $14 for everything.  Not bad, you can go broke buying kale juice.  Would definitely return.",

    "text": "Updated: I wanted to come back and give this place another star. I've come to love this place so much and their food is consistent every single time. It's become a staple for me. I love being able to order ahead on the app or online and pick up, which I recommend doing, because the line can get quite lengthy (I'm not surprised, considering the place is healthy AND delicious). I have a few qualms with the app but I'm not going to reflect that on this location. Consistency is important to me, and when coming here you know what you're going to get.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: So.. star bonus to the owners, first off. Both times I went in, not only were they very friendly and present, they had recommendations ready to go, kept the lines moving, and were very proud of their hard work launching this storefront. The location is extremely convenient, however plan to get take out because there is little to no room to sit and eat, even the expansion of seating in the back. It's a tad embarrassing (as a host)asking a small group out for lunch and not being able to accommodate a place to eat, but not really having been in before, it's something I should've scoped ahead of time.   That being said, I know they are a franchise, but hopefully some suggestions can be made. I wanted a wrap (no added protein) and soup. $16. They only serve large bowls of soup, no small cups as a side or a half wrap/half soup. I even still thought $8 to not have a protein added (extra $2) was a bit much, HOWEVER you have to remind yourself that these are premium, quality ingredients and that it is going to cost a bit more. I scrapped the soup off of my order.   Now onto the food.. I ordered a Tex Mex burrito. The flavors in it were amazing. However without a protein I think it was missing that fullness to the meal and I was left a bit hungry after, despite the size of the burrito. Next time I would definitely get falafel or chicken to give it a bump, but I feel lukewarm about paying $10 for a falafel wrap when there's authentic Mediterranean cuisine downtown that has falafel for less.   I typically circulate the same food places downtown weekly, and although I'll be back, I'm not sure I'll add this to my weekly repertoire of repeat restaurants that I rotate, only due to the cost and not being quite filled. However, the quality of the food and the flavor have kept me as a repeat customer.",

    "text": "Freshii offers a clean, fresh, and tasty approach to lunch in a location previously crowded by fast food, greasy spoons, and traditional heavy Pittsburgh signature dishes.  I remember a time when the only lunch options in downtown were greasy cheese steaks, a sub shop on every corner of the downtown area, or the only accessible (via walking) lunchtime options being fine dining or fast food. Freshii finally offers clean, fresh food to professionals who want to be at the top of their game and not gorging themselves on food that will only lead to afternoon regret or food comas.   Their main attraction is fresh ingredients and they cater to vegetarians and vegans. Recently they've expanded to hormone-free meat additions to their signature dishes which is a nice touch (I like a little more protein in my mid-day meal).   Their options are varied and span the globe in terms of cuisine. Regardless of what you want you can get a grain, noodle, or salad bowl themed on the cuisine of your choice. Price is what you would expect for a fast food or chain these days. Expect to pay somewhere between 8 and 12 dollars for the typical meal. If you want to add fancy drink or juice you can probably add 3-5 bucks on top of that.   What I will say is that what I got was \"A-Ok\" (3 stars on the Yelp scale). It won't blow you away but won't disappoint you either. Freshii definitely is a better option than you would expect from the places I mentioned above and try to stay away from during lunchtime. While there are aspects they could improve on I would return for lunch if I am in the area again.",

In response to owners response: yes it is the Pittsburgh union trust freshii. Yes I still have one of the 10 percent off coupons I received when I pointed out an error - I didn't say it was your policy only that the employees have done that a few times. And yes, thank you for denigrating my review - I'm not sure why I'm surprised though... denial of the problem is typical of places that offer poor service.",

My visit was later in the day, I understand it hasn't been busy in here but the meal overall was barely warm. Maybe it is supposed to be served like that? I'm not sure.

I got the Bamboo: brown rice, mushrooms, red cabbage, broccoli, carrots, cilantro and lime. Tofu, chicken or falafel comes with. Tofu, please!

On top of that the workers are all super friendly and helpful, even when you are asking annoying questions at 7am.  My favorite breakfast item they have is the spinach, mushroom, and goat cheese egg pocket.  This is actually a pretty healthy item, but you would not know it by the taste.

The ingredients were fresh and the overall bowl looked fantastic - really colorful and inviting. The composition of the bowl felt a bit off - a higher ratio of corn and black beans vs avocado and chicken, but it still tasted great. And overall the portion felt quite large - I didn't actually finish the whole thing.   The process felt a bit longer than I expected - both the wait in line and waiting once I ordered. But the staff was super friendly (the owner was actually chatting with folks as they waited in line), so I chalk some of the wait to the fact that its a new restaurant that is finding its groove.   I want to go back soon for breakfast and to try some other options. If you want a healthy, fresh option for lunch in downtown give it a shot.",

Great customer service! The food was also delicious with great salads and burritos. There is also a really neat coffee shop inside too!",

    "text": "Myself and some work friends have been wanting to check out Freshii for the past few weeks and today we finally made it happen. First of all, the atmosphere of this place is very cool and chill. From the grass wall to the open seating to the personable workers who actually use you name, I really dig this place.  Lots of great options from salads and wraps to burritos, salads and bowls. All come vegetarian with an option to add protein at an up charge.  They also do a range of smoothies and juices.  You can customize anything with a card and they get points for having Sriracha available.  I stuck with the Khao San Burrito which had brown rice, spinach, almonds, edamame, mushrooms, carrots, cabbage, spicy peanut & lemongrass sauce clocking in at 650 cals.  And let me just say, nutrition fills you up. Between this and a bag of crisps, I was feeling very satisfied. All that and a bottled drink ran me just under $12 for lunch. Not bad but it is on the pricey side in my opinion. Adding a protein or a smoothie would easily bump this to $16.  Honestly, the Burrito was fantastic. Tons of flavor and True to the name, fresh(ii)!  We went between 11a and Noon with minimal wait time but on the way out there was a good crowd so expect a bit of a wait at lunch. One thing we noted was for being what appears to be a very green organization, there isn't any recycling.   It's not a deal breaker by any means and maybe logistically it wouldn't work but I feel like it is a missed opportunity.  Overall, I'm really impressed and this is now a solid option in my book. Check them out for sure!",

I ordered the Teriyaki Twist bowl and it was delicious and exactly as I ordered it! I will definitely be returning!",
