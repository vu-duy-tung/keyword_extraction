    "text": "\"Mexican food\" in Pittsburgh used to be something like a whisper in the wind, not quite sure if what you heard was actually said. The concept had been ignored, for the most part willfully by our 412 and 724 contemporaries satisfied with a Mad Mex or El Campesino imposter.  Slowly the tide began to turn with Reynas and Las Palmas taco stands creating a migration of the taste bud towards something more original, a secret they were finally willing to bestow upon our woefully ignorant palates.   King Food said Reynas restaurant was legit. I was intrigued, but not compelled to immediate action. Deep down inside though, I knew if King Food said it was legit...that I had to try it out. I recently ventured there with him, my girlfriend and another friend to finally check it out.   I had no idea how much they re-did the basement. It was a quaint cantina, replete with muralistic paintings and cozy lighting.  Our service was attentive and prompt. The salsa sampler...succulent smoky bliss. Every dish that was passed around (I had the Anchos Rellenos) was full of flavors and subtle spicing.   My girlfriend had the Mole sampler, which was a diverse and delicious heaping of food.  I am glad that Reynas proved to Pgh that they are a Mex-I-Can.",

The reason for the 3 stars was the service. While they were extremely nice when asked for anything, we had to ask, often. Missing parts of our orders, incorrect items on check and a standard dinner of drinks, apps, and entrees took over 2 hours. A few more servers would really bring this place up a notch.   Would I go back? Yes. The menu is flushed out enough and the food was tasty. Would enjoy trying the fajitas server in a half pineapple one other party Member had.",

Start off with some chips and salsa. The spicy and sweet mango salsa are both good. They need better containers for their salsa though. They are kinda flat, and do not lend well to scooping. Also, the chips could be a little less oily, but I don't really care after a few tequila shots.  I am a fan of their fish tacos. The fish is always perfectly breaded, and they wrap it in hard, as well as a soft taco shell (delish!). Friends always liked what they ordered. I am always too busy with my fish tacos to pay attention.  If you think El Campesino or Mad Mex are good, come here for some schooling of your taste buds.",

In the winter, the basement setting helps you forget about the dismal weather outside and in the nicer weather, you can snag an outside table.   Margaritas seem a little pricey around $12, but then you realize you get the whole shaker which equates to two margaritas with house-made sour mix.   I can't attest for the whole menu, because I'm in love with the Carnitas mini-tacos. The 4 mini-tacos are enough for me to make a meal out of when coupled with the table-side guac. The rice and beans leave something to be desired, so I don't even bother with them.",

The service here was so bad, though.  It took awhile for our drinks and guacamole to come (made table side... By a child who can't be over 10-11), but not too horribly long. The guac (mediocre) didn't arrive with chips, which was weird, and we had to flag the server down and ask for them, at which point she asked us to \"give her a minute,\" and came back about five min later with chips. She did seem really busy, so this, too, was fine. And then... We didn't see her again for about half an hour. From the time that we got our drinks, it took a full hour to get entrees - tacos and enchiladas shouldn't take anywhere near that long. During this hour, we also noticed a filthy rag that had apparently been left on our table before we sat down. Fun times.   The tacos were actually pretty good, which is why I give two stars - but there is absolutely no excuse for having customers sit at a table for an hour and a half after ordering before their food comes, with no apology. Won't be back.",

    "text": "The restaurant staff was very nice and accommodating to our large group, but I found the food to be very mediocre for a Mexican restaurant. When I asked the waiter for some hot salsa to literally spice up my very plain vegetarian quesadilla (cheese, spinach, and mushrooms in a bleached white flour tortilla), I was given two small bottles of hot sauce, rather than a small cup of fresh salsa or fresh jalapenos. This was very disappointing to me. I expect fresh salsa when I ask for some salsa in a Mexican restaurant. I can buy hot sauce to use at home. I want FRESH ingredients when I'm at a restaurant.   When I tried both bottles, and they still weren't very hot, I asked if there was anything else I could add to my food because, I explained, \"I like hot and spicy food.\" Then, he brought me two more bottles of hot sauce, and a very small container of a green salsa. It was OK, but the flavor was nothing special. The bottles of hot sauce were also just OK. (Although, one bottle of hot sauce WAS highly entertaining for its name, \"One Fucking Drop at a Time!\" Seriously. I'll post pics when I have time. That was really funny!)  The quesadilla was edible, but nothing special, and nothing that I would go out of my way to eat again. There really wasn't any seasoning or spices used. It tasted very plain, which is why I wanted some hot salsa. Maybe their meat dishes are better, but I've become a vegetarian and haven't eaten meat since Jan. 1, 2014. There were very few options for vegetarian meals.  The highlight of the meal was the guacamole, which was very good on my plate, but not so much on my head! One of the waiters (while clearing the table) had overloaded a tray with plates and accidentally dropped one of the plates with leftover food RIGHT ON MY HEAD!   I felt the plate (and food) land on me from behind, and then it fell over my shoulder, onto my lap, and onto the floor! I ended up with guacamole in my hair! I wish someone had recorded a video of the dish falling on my head because I'm sure it would be hilarious to watch, and I missed my opportunity to become a YouTube sensation! LOL. Fortunately, I sustained no damage, and I'll bet my hair will be extra shiny this week due to the guacamole conditioning treatment that I received at no extra charge.   I would go back to Casa Reyna if I was with a group that wanted to go, but I would not seek it out myself. The selection is kind of slim pickings for vegetarians. But, the staff is very nice. I have no bad feelings about the dropped plate. We are all human, and we all make mistakes. I was a waitress in college, and my nickname was \"Crash!\" LOL. But, I never dropped food on anyone's head. I just dropped a tray full of glasses on the floor once at C.J. Barney's in Oakland...about 32 years ago. Damn, I'm old. :-)",

    "text": "This place will hopefully be the turnaround moment for PGH Mexican food, which in general has been one of my greatest disappointments with food in this city.   Everyone loves Mexican food, but IMHO the city doesn't have a truly great option. Instead of focusing on my negative opinions about Mexican food in the burgh, I'll focus on the positive at Reyna's.  First, some history; I actually took a small tour of this place about 4 years ago when it was barebones (but still looked functional) and have been wondering why the long wait.  Well, upon entering, you'll see why. The atmosphere is extremely solid and beautiful. Very intimate as well. But, we're here for the food right? Reyna's is one of the handful of Mexican groceries in the city, and they have a reputation for making salsa and their chips are everywhere! I think Mad Mex still buys their tortilla chips..though that may have changed. Regardless, they had a lot at stake here and the time to prepare.  The payoff is great...and give it some time.. I think this place will be *the* staple food to take your out of town friends.  I don't even want to go into details about the food here; I had the Chiles Rellenos, multiple salsas, and my friend had the Tilapia. Though there were a few so-so's, we were quite floored by the majority of tastes. The owner, Nic, is adamant about keeping recipes as close to authentic as possible and you can sense the extra mile in every bite.  Great job guys.",

I should have known better when I went to Casa Reyna because the place was deserted; the cook was Asian; and perhaps most importantly, when I asked for salsa or hot sauce, after a puzzled look, the waitress brought me a bottle of some red stuff that was crusted over at the top.  I've never been to a \"Mexican\" restaurant that did not offer homemade salsa and hot sauce.    The food was mediocre and expensive.  I left thinking that they wanted to ensure I never came back.",

    "text": "First the good: this is a really excellent location. It is a beautiful and cozy but not cave-like underground location, lots of wood with cast iron accents. Really nice, and I wish more Pittsburgh venues were visually impressive like this.  Our service was friendly and reasonably attentive, though there were only 3 tables seated at the time we ate, around 6pm on a Sunday.  Now the rest: I love Mexican food, from the authentic (as in, I ate it in Mexico) to the street food scene (LA taco carts, Reyna's taco cart, the place on Atwood in Oakland), to the homestyle mexican restaurants (like El Campesino)  I also especially liked Reyna's drinks - lime agua fresca and horchata.  So I was very hopeful that Reyna's really good taco cart beginnings would translate into an even better restaurant experience.  Boy were we disappointed.  First off, they never offered any complimentary chips and salsa, even after we ordered entrees... so if they do then I missed out.  My daughter, who loves the lengua served at the local taco carts (Reyna's included) ordered the two lengua tacos.  They would not mix it up (meaning one fish, one lengua), you had to pick only one.  I ordered the dish with four moles, because I really like any mole i've ever had.  Her tacos were quite good, though she liked the Oakland taco cart ones better.  I think the reason why is that they were under-seasoned.  My moles were especially disappointing.  One (with chicken) - i think mole ranchero - was too sweet, and not richly flavored, didn't like it at all (and that's my favorite!).  Two others were good but not great.. the best was the green with pork, though the pork was chewy.  And the one with I think ancho and poblano was deeply earthy but not enjoyable, though the meat in it  was tender and good.  Not a bit of cilantro or lime with my food. Both my rice (white) and hers (red) were bland.  Our appetizer of the roasted corn and cheese (Esquites?) was also very bland. The chips needed salt as did the corn stuff... very very wet, as if there was a lot of cream in it... it was not at all what I hoped for, but I don't have other experiences with that to compare.  Finally, the horchata was unusually creamy and more gritty than usual (for Reynas). My lime agua fresca tasted like sugar water with barely a hint of lime. When I told the waiter, he came back with a pitcher of intensely strong lime stuff with barely any sweetness at all, very sour. I just added a bunch of water and sugar to make it better.  So all that for $40... meh, we won't be back, unless we hear excellent news sometime in the future.",

Me and my date went there in the early afternoon on a weekday, so we were the only ones there. We shared chips and guacamole, which was fantastic. I'm not usually one for gimmicks like guac made in front of you, but it was tasty. The tortillas used in the chips are made fresh in a glass room next to the restaurant, which is great to watch.  I had the chilaquiles with steak (tortillas with red sauce), and she had the carne en chile verde (braised pork in green tomatillo sauce). She was really happy with it, especially with the refried beans and rice. I've had better beans (they were blended, not my favorite texture), but overall both dishes were a success.  The atmosphere is great. It's in the basement of a great little Mexican grocery. I've bought mole sauce from them before, but had no idea there was a restaurant in the basement. Little touches, like the wood furnishings and lighting, really brought me back to Ensenada in Baja.  I've been dying for authentic Mexican since I moved here two and a half years ago. I'm glad that I have finally found it. We were very pleased, and I'm sure we'll be back.",

While you head down the stairs to the basement, you may think, why am I going down a weird stairway to a creepy basement? But then you walk into the doorway downstairs and it's a beautiful restaurant! All dark wood with grand wooden tables. The decorations are everywhere, while borderline tacky, they're fun to look at. Especially the large picture of a blue haired warrior (I think warrior??).   The server was super friendly and attentive and our apps and meal came out in what seemed like five seconds. Granted we were there around 6:30pm when it wasn't too busy, but it sure seemed hoppin' by the time we left around 8ish.   I was excited to order a margarita, and even more excited when it came in a large shaker. Time to party!! It was good, but it wasn't awesome. I think it was a tad too sweet for me. Maybe a little less triple sec? But for $12, I'd say it was a good size.  There's literally 8 different salsa's to choose from, which can be a bit overwhelming. But if you want spicy or mild, fruit or veggie, it's all there. We tried the verde and the chipotle, and both were very good. I thought the chipotle was way different than I'd ever had, but I really liked it. Plus the chips were fresh and homemade.   I ordered the enchilada, but switched it up with shrimp instead of chicken with a $2 up-charge.  It came loaded with lettuce, sauce and 3 corn tortilla's. Plus, white rice. I love me some sauce, so it was nice to mix in with the rice. And the enchilada was very tasty. I actually could go for one right now... hmmmmm....  So what was wrong? I was bummed about the gauc. It wasn't good. It wasn't bad. It was just lacking seasoning. I really thought it would have been awesome, being that the I have high standards with their taco stand out front. Hopefully that will get better, but I will surely be back to house some more food in the near future!",

    "text": "So disappointed after the reopening. The service was sub par which I could have looked past since it was all new staff but the food really fell short.  I could not wait to get my hands on some of their amazing queso! I was so disappointed when our queso came out, it was equivalent to a bowl of shredded cheese that had been microwaved. It was absolutely impossible to dip a chip in the queso as it was a solid blob of cheese.   I also ordered salsa, I've always been a huge fan of their fruit salsa with pureed mango. It is now dry and little cubes of mango which was ok but it was so delicious before.  I also loved the margaritas before, after they poured you one you still had almost a whole additional one in the shaker, not anymore.. I think they got bigger glasses. The entire margarita now fits and the ice melts it before you can finish.  Lastly are the tacos, in the past you received a generous portion of rice and beans, they have really downsized the portions which is unfortunate. They are also serving the food on metal trays with checkered paper, something you would expect from a BBQ place. The waiter handed me the tray without warning that it was hot which I didn't expect!  I really loved this place in the past, especially the fajita in half a pineapple! Bring this and the other classics back!",

    "text": "Two words: THE SMELLS. AHHHH! As soon as you walk downstairs into this, what I'd like to say, authentic Spanish underground oasis, you get hit with these amazing smells and they give you ALL of the feels! :) At first look, you see everyone eating outside wrapping around the restaurant/market but if you go inside, you'll find a stairwell to leads downstairs. There's no windows down there but it feels like you're in something straight from Mexico City. Loved the atmosphere.   I learned that they make all of their tortilla shells and chips fresh right there in the restaurant, hence all of the smells.  All of their margaritas are made fresh as well with fruit juices and agave nectar. Try the guava margarita if it's on special! A-MAZ-ING.   The menu itself is pretty big with a lot of selections. I recommend trying the salsa sampler for as low as $3! Try at least the mango one. Nice and sweet.    Even though the menu gives you a wide selection, I'd say the prices are slightly higher than normal. Maybe because it's an authentic Spanish restaurant but who knows. I went with the steak tacos topped with onions and fresh cilantro with a side of black beans... I had to choose between beans OR rice... not both... which is not favorable in my opinion. I'm a hungry man! I need both.   If you're looking for an authentic Spanish restaurant with a great atmosphere, I would definitely recommend this place in the Strip District. Great food, drinks and feel but just a little pricey for not-so-much food and I wish our waitress would've checked in on us more often (all reasons for the 3-star review). But all in all, a great time!",

Their drink menu adheres to the atmosphere and offers a variety of tequilas (as real Mexican restaurants do,) as well as micheladas which are easily my favorite drink...ever.   That all being said it was pretty much the only thing I liked about Casa Reyna. My rule of thumb when it comes to most restaurants is : If fish tacos are on the menu order that. If the chef has trouble executing a good fish taco then everything on the menu is likely to be sub-par.   It wasn't the only bad taco though the shrimp, bistek and chorizo were also pretty bad. Literally no flavor what so ever with the fish and shrimp. Both were previously frozen, which is fine, if it wasn't basic Giant Eagle shrimp small and flavorless. Neither were transformed to provide any experience but disappointment. The Bistek and the chorizo were crazy salty.   Sooo this isn't a Mexican restaurant where you go to eat tacos (it sounds crazy I know). The guac was OK too much tomato and not done tableside, despite it being named tableside guac.   The place is too nice to give it a 2-star rating and I haven't had their main dishes which to their defense, looked pretty good and made me wish I didn't order my poop tacos. I had some serious food envy. I will return to try their main dishes, just don't go here for tacos because I'm scared you'll never go back.",

And as of last summer they opened outdoor seating which is always a plus in the summer.  To start with, they offer 9 different salsas you can choice from. My favorite is the sweet mango & peanut. There's something for everybody, from mild to very hot. They make their chips onsite & they bring them out to you warm. The chips are bottomless so you can get refills.  Also the Elote Dip appetizer is so good! Warm creamy cheesy corn that you eat with the chips. Fantastic! I've tried a few different entrees. The jalapeno tilapia with angel hair pasta is delicious. If you don't mind spicy this dish is a must try. Have not had a dish like this one at any other restaurant. However my favorite is the fish tacos. The fish is cooked perfectly, not greasy & lots of flavor.  For dessert I highly recommend the tres leches cake. Which is Spanish for \"3 milks cake\". It's vanilla cake with vanilla icing & a vanilla cream poured over top. So sweet, creamy & delicious!  At Casa Reyna service is always great & prices are very reasonable. They really have a lot of great dishes & I highly recommend them!",

I moved out to the eastern United States about 2 years ago so I've gotten used to subpar Mexican food, but this was a particularly bad experience. First of all, what kind of restaurant doesn't even provide free chips and salsa? Now to the food. I ordered chicken enchiladas. The sauce was fine, but I found bones in the shredded chicken. After I got through two enchiladas, I found a long hair spread across the last two. Asked the waiter to replace them which she did, but then came a crime even more egregious than the hair. She brought out the two replacements rather quick (almost immediately) so I was curious as to how what was possible because I know what it takes to make enchiladas. They didn't bake them or anything. It was just a plain tortilla stuffed with chicken and they threw sauce on it. If you're going to replace enchiladas stuffed with hair, you should probably take the time to make them right. Still charged full price for them. This place is too expensive for the quality of food and service. And there was a bug on our table.",

Now as a precursor I will admit that this is the only time that I have dined at Casa Reyna, and typically I won't write a review until I have dined at least twice. However, most likely this will be my only experience dining here.  So why the extra star? The downstairs dining area is quite beautiful. Other than that it was an all around poor dining experience. Appetizer came out with our food, which we watched sit in the window for about 15 minutes. Naturally everything was cold. Our food was pretty bland and all overall unimpressive, and the appetizer was supposed to be a rendition of Mexican street corn as a dip, but tasted like they just took a half a jar of miracle whip and a can of sweet corn and threw some chips on the side, pretty gross. And to top it all off, the food is quite overpriced.  If you head 6 blocks North there is a little taco stand called Edgar's. Save yourself the disappointment of Reyna's and head there if you're craving Mexican.",

    "text": "I went to Casa Reyna for dinner and overall it was a very good experience. It's located in a basement that feels warm and cozy without being claustrophobic. I had the Guiso vegetariano with a side of roasted corn salad and another side of spicy pickled cactus salad. The Guiso was rich and hearty and very flavorful, it comes with tortillas so I made sort of tacos with it. The portion was generous, I ate about half. It was filled with lots of different veggies and beans, in a red-brown sauce. It was everything good about Latin vegetarian food, with lots of flavor, not just a mess of bland beans and cheese.The corn salad was great, there was a charred flavor to it. I was very excited about the pickled cactus salad and wasn't disappointed. It was mixed with some peppers and onions that were also pickled, and was pretty spicy. I expected the cactus to be slimy but it wasn't at all, it was about the texture of a pickled beet. Overall very good Latin food.",

Praise the corn flour tortilla Gods that these guys have it together and only top theirs with goodness, and no sour cream.   Stopped in here on a rainy 2nd Sunday, for tacos with a friend; I got 3, (sorry, I hate being a pain, but a girl wants what she wants) barbacoa, (lamb) el pastor, (pork and pineapple) and chicken (duh), with cilantro and onions. They were quickly prepared, and brought to my table. I also grabbed all three salsa options, and put them on the side. They were all used quickly! The El Pastor was probably my fav, it reminded me of tacos in Cancun on Spring Break, oh so many years ago! But the Barbacoa was good too, nice and flavorful. Chicken is chicken, but still, so amazing.   Can't beat the deal, or the punch of flavor! Try a Pineapple Fanta while you're at it, you only live once, and it's perfect with the El Pastor taco!   Happy Eating!",

    "text": "I'm from Texas, so I have pretty high standards for Mexican food. I started off with a negative opinion of Casa Reyna, because they broke two important rules for Mexican restaurants: 1. They charge for chips and salsa. Although the price is only $3 for tons of chips and two types of salsa, no one would ever come to your restaurant in Texas if they found out that chips and salsa weren't free. 2. For their lunch portions, you get only one side so you must choose between rice or beans instead of having both. In Texas, this is also a huge no-no.  That being said, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the food at Casa Reyna was actually really good, and so I can forgive their sins.   We ordered the chips and salsa with the salsa roja and salsa verde. While neither sauce was particularly spicy (only the roja claimed to be), they were both very flavorful and zesty.   I ordered the Enchiladas Reynas (chicken enchiladas with a lime cilantro sour cream sauce) with a side of black beans. All of the flavors in the sauce worked well together (although it was just a tad too acidic) and the chicken was juicy. The black beans tasted great too. Overall, it was a plate of enchiladas that you could expect to see in any top notch Tex-Mex place in the Lone Star state.   If you are in the Pittsburgh area and you want some good Mexican food, I would definitely recommend Casa Reyna.",

I ordered the fish tacos with corn tortillas, Mexican-style. They were bland and dry; edible, but not good. Sad little side dishes of rice and refried beans were included which also were not particularly good. On top of that, the service was a little strange - I probably got asked how the food was or how I was doing every minute or two when it first arrived (and no I didn't tell them that it was \"meh\" - that's a little awkward).  A couple of months later I decided to try my luck again for lunch. Their lunch menu was basically tacos or quesadillas (maybe changes based on the day of the week?). Since my previous taco experience was underwhelming, I decided to give the veggie quesadillas a shot. Boy was I disappointed. Lots of food (too much actually), but extremely bland; almost no flavor, and absolutely no spice. To remedy the situation I poured tons of hot sauce on them, but they were still among the worst quesadillas I've had in recent memory.  Sadly I think I'm done with this place. You may have better luck for dinner, but I would definitely avoid their lunch.",

When we began planning our wedding reception earlier this year, I called Casa Reyna to see if they might be able to cater. Not only was Carol, the catering coordinator, easy to work with (and patient with my planning anxieties!), she went out of her way to ensure that our needs and wants were met in full. She reviewed all pricing to ensure we didn't overpay, and she let us know about items that were cheaper than initially indicated in order to help us keep costs down.   Additionally, she worked with the chef and Casa Reyna's owner to design new vegetarian recipes for our reception, as both my partner and I are vegetarians. We ordered the taco bar for our event, and requested some additional vegetarian options, though we understood that vegetarian tacos aren't necessarily \"traditional.\" Reyna's, however, was willing to show us (and all our guests) that a vegetarian taco could be as exciting and mouth-watering as any meat-filled taco. We had potato and pepper tacos, soy chorizo tacos, and seasonal veggie and asparagus tacos, all of which were cooked and seasoned to perfection (and I don't use the word \"perfection\" lightly).   By the end of our wedding reception, several guests had pulled me aside to tell me this was the best wedding meal they'd ever had. I agreed whole-heartedly. Casa Reyna was not only able to prepare a phenomenal meal with various options for over 100 people, but also worked with us to ensure the experience was pleasant, convenient, and truly what we hoped for (if not beyond what we hoped for). Although I don't plan on ever getting married again, if I did, I'd hire Casa Reyna again in a heartbeat!",

I've had some amazing ones over the years and the things that makes them amazing are the freshness of the ingredients, the quality/tenderness of the meat, the imaginative combos, and the double wrap homemade tortillas. And yes, Casa Reyna has all of those!  And they were cheap! Got my belly full with 4 \"mini\" tacos,for $9. Two carnitas (very good) and two tinga (excellent chicken option). I also sampled my wife's el pastor and that will be my next choice for sure. That one was fabulous. Lots of salsa choices makes for great chip dipping. I am such a fan of that!

I was really hoping Casa Reyna would turn out to be a go-to spot for Mexican dining-out.  We had a pleasant meal here, and overall felt that we got a decent portion for our value. However, our overall experienced was just OK.  We got the salsa sampler with housemade corn chips.  The chips were great! They are house-made and very similar to the chips sold in bags upstairs in the grocery store. Some of the salsas were excellent - my favorite was the mango. Others, like the chipotle salsa, were somewhat disappointing.  We then split an order of the four traditional moles, upon a previous reviewer's suggestion that the portions were enough for two.  And, True to the reviewer's word, the portion was quite generous.  If you're looking for a good quantity of food, this dish is good value.  I enjoyed the adobo mole and the guisado de pollo, but I thought the others were just so-so.   The ambiance felt strange the night we were there, because it seems made for a lively and rambunctious crowd but the restaurant was very empty when we were there. Also, our service was slow and not very friendly. I would have given the food 4 stars, but the overall ambiance and service left much to be desired.  I would consider coming back to try some of the other food in the summer when we could sit outdoors.",

    "text": "Casa Reyna seems to appear on everyone's list of Best Tacos in Pittsburgh and after sampling, I concur. I'd also put them on a Best Salsas in Pittsburgh list.   Seriously salsa and tacos are 2 of the most exciting foods ever for pretty much every member of our family and when you find a restaurant with a whole list of each as options and they turn out to be this delicious, we started wondering why we'd never eaten here before.   We ordered the Habanero & Green Jalapeno  salsas with chips to start. The Habanero packed some serious heat & after burn so I had to dip lightly on that one. Hubby dove in with abandon because he loves the heat and most often can't get anything hot enough. This was totally to his liking. The green jalapeno wasn't overly hot but had delightful flavor. We'd love to go back and try the Chipoltle and the Spicy Mango, too.   The mini tacos are a great deal at 4 for $9 with the option of choosing 2 varieties. I chose the braised pork and El Pastor with crispy pork and pineapple. Yum on both with serious high praise for the El Pastor. Hubby tried the pork and Tinga, which was a chicken taco with lots of great flavor.   The restaurant is really cute with a nice rustic style located downstairs off Penn Avenue with some communal and smaller tables plus a small bar. I could see it getting somewhat loud when it's crowded since sound seemed to reverberate.   Lunch service was quick, efficient, friendly & obviously tasty. We'll be back!",

    "text": "Well... After 5 visits to this once awesome restaurant, I have been angered beyond belief at the service, or should I say lack there of, that we encountered today.  We were meandering around the Strip looking for a place to grab a drink and catch the Ghana/Germany World Cup match.  We've had such great experiences here before, and I loved the Skinny Margarita that I have had every time so it seemed like a perfect place to go.  Long story short- it was a miserable experience.   Regular margaritas were what was made and we asked the first bartender if they were the Skinny.  He said yes... He always uses sours mix in it (dude- this is not a skinny then, FYI).  We then asked the rude blonde female that was working who couldn't have been nastier to us.  She said it's how they always make them.  Well- apparently she always makes them wrong then because on my previous 4 visits, the drinks were good, consistent and not full of sours mix.  Her attitude was unacceptable. Pretty much was so defensive and nasty that we certainly were not going to order a different drink or get food there.  Actually- we probably won't be back. Ever. That's how poorly she handled this situation.  Service is the biggest reason why we choose where we go... The bar staff from today needs a major lesson in this arena.",

The guacamole is a must-- it is a huge bowl and a great price for a fresh and authentic Mexican staple! I also had their chicken tinga mini tacos which had the right amount of spice and sauce, and the portion size was just right. We sat outside and enjoyed a nice breeze and good people watching of those walking through the Strip District. The only set-back was that it took forever for us to get our appetizers and then our food, so it was almost a 90-minute meal in total service time. Overall though, this place was great and I look forward to returning!  Pro Tip: If you're in a rush but want your taco fix, you can stop by their taco truck which is out front of the restaurant and order tacos to go (or purchase them to bring to your table too!). They are just as delicious and authentic!",

The service was horrible, starting with the \"just water right\" response from the waitress, even before we sat down.  Our food, which took over an hour to get to us, with no real apology, was given to us, one at a time. Best part, the table beside us ordered what I did, the dry as all hell chicken fajitas, for theirs first before me! My wife was pretty much done with her food even before mine and I had to wait over five minutes, after I received my food, to get shells for the fajitas.  To make it simple the food is over priced, small portions, horrible service, and just not very good. We paid $30 and it was not worth it at all!

Needless to say I am picky about my Mexican food and this place knocked it out of the park.    Their skinny margarita was spot on and a generous size but, really the food was the star.  We had the mini tacos and salsa to start, the chorizo was awesome.  For our main course we had the Cuatro Moles Traditionales,the verdes mole was my personal favorite and my boyfriend enjoyed the gaujillo, but all of it was fantastic. The service was prompt, pleasant and she timed our 3 course meal perfectly. We plan on visiting again and eventually trying everything on the menu.",

I've been here at least 5 times with coworkers and we all just bring our water bottles b/c we know how bad the water is. Bizarre.  The wait staff isn't that helpful or welcoming.  An upcharge of $2 for a tiny container of extra cheese? It's pretty laughable. Imagine adding 50 cents worth of cheese to a bite.   Ordered a horchata once which was pretty underwhelming. It tasted like melted vanilla ice cream with a dash of cinnamon. My friend says, \"I bet this is just plain milk.\" I ask the waitress what sort of milk they use since the menu indicates rice milk (and mostly because any restaurant should be able to and must tell you what you're eating/drinking). She comes back with no answer and is borderline rude, \"So, yeah, I just can't help you. There's nothing I can do. Sorry.\" Umm.. okay, then! Sorry I asked?!  Moral: Al pastor tacos are delish. The whole dining experience I could do without.",

The tacos are in the \"great\" category, as are the more traditional and less Tex-mex-y dishes, such as the Carne en Chile Verde (braised pork), whereas the enchiladas are fine but nothing to freak out about.   I highly recommend all the salsas and house-made chips.  I also like that the margaritas come in a pitcher, which ends up being 2-3 glasses, so that's a good value. Next time I go I am trying the \"Four Taditional Moles\"  Last time I went we sat at the bar and the bartender was pretty knowledgeable about different tequilas, and extremely professional and friendly.

They kept waffling back and forth, trying to get me to order more salsa's than what I asked for (three, just with chips) and then didn't give us a price quote. Well, later I found out why, because they wanted to upcharge it. I get it, I order catering for a big name institution in this city, they want to try to get as much money out of us as they think they can, but if I'd known we were going to be spending $2000 on chips and salsa (yes, really) I'd have told my boss we should get big tubs of salsa from costco.  Then they were late with the delivery and got lost. I understand Pittsburgh can be a tough city to navigate, especially if you're new (as their coordinator kept telling me) but the whole thing was just so frustrating. I've heard great things about their food, but at least for catering, it's just not worth the trouble of trying to get them.",

Compounded by the fact that they have a taco stand outside (especially when the weather is good!) and a grocery store above, this is pretty much a one-stop place for all your Latin American needs. The restaurant offers a lot of options. Decor is not bad--rather dim, but that's because it's underground.   One point of confusion is that there is a lunch menu with sandwiches and tortas on their website, but when we tried to ask for one on Sunday, the receptionist was rather confused, and my broken Spanish didn't help things either. Well, there are lunch portions for some items on the regular menu, so that was a fine compromise (stlll wanted that cubana torta though). I got the enchiladas verdes with refried beans; the enchiladas were not bad, but I really like the beans. Lots of flavor, good texture, and overall portion was good.  In general, I think they're comparable to some other frequented Mexican places, though El Milagro feels more homey and is a bit less expensive.",

    "text": "I came here with several friends a couple of months ago.  I convinced them to give it a try, since my labmate and the reviews seemed to indicate that it's the most genuine (sit down) Mexican restaurant in the city.  Given PGH's paucity of good Mexican options, I was excited to try it out!  The space was plenty large enough for our group, and we were seated without any wait, etc. on a Sat. evening at 6pm.  We started off with some margaritas.  Two of my friends opted for the mango variety, and I chose the strawberry one, which I split with another friend.  They were both delicious!  Per other reviewers' recommendations, we split the salsa sampler with green and sweet mango salsas.  This comes with a batch of their chips, made fresh in-house.  While I expected to like the mango salsa best, I found that I actually preferred the green salsa, as the mango was a bit too sweet for my taste.  If possible, I'd recommend trying several salsa varieties to see which you like best, as tastes vary!  Next, we ordered entrees.  After much deliberation, I chose the mole enchiladas, which came with refried beans and rice.  While the enchiladas themselves were good, I wasn't a huge fan of the mole sauce--it was a bit too bitter for my taste.  The food was definitely quite filling, however, to the extent that I was unable to finish it.  If/when I return, I will order something different--perhaps the chiles rellenos, which my labmate recommends.  One of my friends, who grew up in Honduras and Peru, ordered the fajitas.  Holy Toledo, talk about a lot of food!  Although he has a decent appetite, he ended up taking half of it home for later consumption.  We definitely concur that the food is very genuine, so don't come here expecting Tex-Mex.  Service was generally okay, but I have one complaint.  When we ordered the margaritas, the waiter carded us, which is understandable given the laws and that all of us are in our twenties.  We arrived at different times, and he carded two of my female friends when they sat down, saying he had to be fair, etc.  However, he did not card my male friend, who arrived last, despite that he was not the oldest in the group.  I could be misreading the situation, but as it stands, this seemed a bit misogynistic.",

The sangria was not very good at all, again didn't taste bad but certainly was not as good as almost any other sangria I have ever drank. The Bloody Maria however was grotesque! It was not palatable and a total waste of $9. It was salty, and watery (somehow at the same time), and tasted strongly of really bad tequila.  When all said and done it was $57 for a meal that was not in the least enjoyable. Though sitting out side was nice, I feel we could have achieved that pretty much anywhere on such a beautiful day.

Anyway, they were very good. Good flavor, well prepared, just bit on the pricey side since they were $5 for 2 street tacos (4\" corn tortillas). Anyhow, the tacos are well worth a try.

    "text": "This might have become my favorite Mexican restaurant in town, but it's not perfect.  Since it's under Reyna's grocer it's in a basement, and it's tough to get away from that feeling.  It's not that you feel claustrophobic in there, but no windows are no windows, and it has a bit of that basement feel to it.  The decor/ambiance (aside from no windows) is nice and warm, although the decor is fairly (putting it nicely?) over the top.    The salsa and chips are fantastic, but ask your server about the salsas.  I'm a bit (also putting it nicely) of a wuss when it comes to spicy food.  So I've ordered salsas that were a bit over my threshold, and I regretted it.  The sweet mango salsa is fantastic, but skip the guacamole.  I love some guacamole, and can make better at home.  It just doesn't really taste like anything.    Margaritas - If you balk at the $12 price tag don't be fooled.  You essentially get at least 2 when they bring you a shaker,  so be prepared to drink up.    In my two visits I've tried the enchiladas verde, and the tacos (steak, chicken, and chorizo).  Loved them all.  Will definitely continue visiting Casa Reyna's whenever I want Mexican food, which is quite often.",

Simple requests or questions were answered with eye rolls and sighs.   The food was flavorless,  entrees we had enjoyed in the past tasted nothing like they did before they closed and re-opened. We won't be going back.",

The food is always pretty good and their prices for both food and drink are reasonable. We usually get their tacos, but recently we have been expanding out to their other dishes and we have enjoyed everything so far. I would not say that this place is deserving of a 4 star rating, but since I can't give them a 3.5 I rounded up.  Looking forward to coming back here in the near future.",

I was tempted to try the margaritas (They have, possibly, 90 % of Tequila varieties in existence?!) but since it was a bit early, went with the Horchata. This is what angels must sip in heaven. I ordered the Shrimp Ceviche, and the boy went for the Nachos with Lamb Barbacoa and Carnitas. (The legitimate names of these dishes are slipping my mind, but you get the gist.) We waited quite a while... apparently there was a computer error putting the order in. I swear to you, it was WORTH the wait.  This was the best ceviche I've ever had, the lamb barbacoa on the nachos was perfection, and the servings were insanely generous. Try this place if you like fresh, authentic Mexican food!",

I guess you can eat at the picnic tables that line along the sidewalk.. but we opted for the more quiet indoor option.  Service was exceptional. Food was on point. We also shared an appetizer of chips and salsa. I'd even recommend someone go here for just some margaritas and tasty salsas. I'll probably do it myself sometime soon.",

We ordered their freshly made salsa(There are a few varieties to choose from) & homemade chips as an appetizer. Very tasty.  I had the Tamal entree. The presentation was very nice. It came with rice & black beans.  I found it to be a bit bland but I was trying something new.  My husband had the shrimp tacos which he said were a bit bland as well.  We would definitely give it another try though.  Maybe we just needed to be a bit more adventurous with our entree choices.",

The atmosphere reminded me of the family-style Mexican restaurants back home in California, and the service was efficient and friendly.   My friend and I started with the house-made chips and two salsas, habanero and verde. Both were delicious, and I would recommend the habanero if you enjoy salsa on the spicier side. We also ordered drinks. My house margarita was good but a little weak. It paired well with the food though, so I'd probably order it again. We both had tacos, which came with black beans and rice. Mine were al pastor done Mexican style with onions and cilantro. The meat was a little fatty but tasted delicious, and I really liked the rice and beans. I left full and with plans to come back again next time I'm in the area.",

The restaurant has a really authentic feel and if I remember correctly, some nights they even have live music!   We started off with chips and salsa (the house salsa and tomatillo verde). For $3, they gave a huge pile of freshly made chips! The salsas were very fresh tasting, although I think they could have been a bit spicier. We also got a margarita shaker to share - it wasn't particularly strong (that's how I prefer it) but I could see other people wanting them stronger.   We each got tacos for our entrees. They came with rice and refried beans as well as some spicy cream sauce. I had the fish and the al pastor tacos. The fish was cooked nicely but could have been a bit more flavorful, and the al pastor was a little too salty but I still enjoyed it. Service was quick and friendly as well.   Overall, I think Casa Reyna is a great value for all the food you get and is one of the better authentic Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh!",

(Now ex)bf was working one Friday night and I was on my own for dinner so I moseyed on over to Casa Reyna in the strip district near where he lives. I had read about this place making good enmoladas so I decided to give it a go. But wait! Enmoladas aren't actually on the menu and since I didn't know what was in an enmolada, I wasn't sure what dish might be comparable (I mean hey, if someone on the internet tells me that something is delicious, who am I to question their authority amirite??) Anyway, after asking the waiter about it, he talked to the kitchen staff and you know what? They know what enmoladas are and they made one for me! How's that for superb customer service. It was super tasty and now I want more.  The food here overall is really good. They have a tableside guacamole with housemade tortilla chips that were yummy (and pretty cool to watch them prepare it right in front of you) and also housemade horchata that tastes reeeeeeaalllyyy good with a splash of rum. Or whatever you like - they're very sweet here and made a ton of recommendations for me.  IN ADDITION TO ALL THAT GOODNESS.. the Friday that I was there, they had live music! I'm not sure if it was a special occasion or it's a Friday night thing but I thought that was really fun.  This place is located downstairs of Reyna Foods which is a market right on Penn. It's on some cross street but I can't remember which. Anyway, this place is a nice change from typical Pittsburgh eateries and the staff was so so nice that I recommend coming here 110%!",

I've been sampling Mexican from Leetsdale to Lawrenceville and been mostly disappointed. But now they're onto something!  A great looking space, xlnt service and delicious food. Chips and salsa and tortillas top notch! My carnitas chile verde was super tender and tasty. A little heavy on the salt, but haven't had such good Mx since leaving SF Bay. Also very generous drinks. I'm def. going back to try other dishes. Go dig.",

The tacos and salsas were fresh and full of flavors. The fact they make their tacos onsite likely helps. The margarita was one of the best that I've ever had as well. My only reason for not giving Casa Reyna five stars is the price. It seems expensive compared to other Mexican restaurants. That being said, I'll be back often just not as frequently as I'd like.",

I had steak tacos and they were slightly bland but when I added a bit of salt, it really brought out the flavors. We also tried the guacamole, which is prepared table side, it was great as was the salsa sampler. The heat in the habanero salsa wasnt overbearing and it had a great taste to it. My only real complaint is the entrance is sort of confusing. There isnt any signage and if I wouldnt have read previous reviews about the restaurant being downstairs, I probably would have had no idea. All in all though, the food was great and Ill probably be back in the future.",

    "text": "3rd time, last time.  Not going to get into the food mess that resulted in the gift certificate from visit two, but with much reluctance, we returned.  It was a nice night so we opted for the outdoor table.  (I think this could be a no-no if you want good service because I don't recall getting this neglected indoors) 20 minutes after the seating, we were finally approached and ordered chips and 2 salsas, queso fundito and shrimp ceviche to share.  After traveling to the other three tables first, the chips arrived accompanied by 2/3rds empty standard white ramekins.  Very runny salsa...  Nearly impossible to dip.  Flavors were ok though! Still I have no freaking clue why they don't just serve the oh so delicious table salsa that they sell in the store. A round bowl would also be nice. Nevertheless, all would be forgiven if they brought their A-game with the cheese dip.... but it never came.  Instead, after traveling to the other 3 tables first, our shrimp in ketchup, errr, shrimp ceviche arrived.  Tiny boiled shrimp, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro stirred into about 2 cups of Mr. Heinz special sauce, topped, or shall I say, shielded by a half an avocado. It was literally disgusting. All you could taste was fishy ketchup, and I looove ketchup. (see picture) When I finally got the waitress' attention, before I could request my bill and a vomit bag she realized our queso was not on the table and split.  Moments later we were handed a heaping bowl of the thickest queso I've ever had.  Not necessarily the worst.  The flavor profile and splash of salsa verde were interesting, but the heft of the dairy and thickness were too much.  3rd trip to Casa Reyna and 3rd extreme variation on the classic staple.  We couldn't get out of there fast enough.  I had so much hope for this restaurant.  Reyna Food's is such a strong established store, how could this happen?  Pittsburgh desperately needs good Mexican, and all we got here was substandard food at a PREMIUM price.  I should note, that on previous occasions I have had the tacos.  They are ok, but don't hold a candle to Edgar's.  If the stand around the side near Pamela's is open, for the love of everything holy, go there!",

    "text": "This review is difficult given the fact that I am from Texas and consider myself a pretty harsh judge of good mexican food. Having said that, this place really did not fit the bill. I was excited as the restaurant had come recommended by friends that thought that I would like it. I ordered a margarita, the salsa sampler, and the four moles. The salsas (casera and chipotle) were interesting, not in a good way. The chipotle salsa was thick and almost creamy, not what I would typically eat with a corn chip. The flavor was so dense, it was hard to eat. The four moles were unfortunately a huge let down, which made me upset because I love a good mole! All of my food came out cold. The mole poblano had very little taste, the tomatillo mole was extremely runny and just tasted of tomatillos without any spice or extra flavor, and the guisado de pollo was just seasoning, not a sauce. The only redeeming part of the plate was the adobo mole. The meat was tender and juicy and the mole was well seasoned. The margarita was just okay. I was so excited for good mexican food here in Pittsburgh; however Casa Reyna left a lot to be desired.",

Beware their measures of spiciness may be different than yours - moderate per their description is not so moderate to me. But, they are nonetheless delicious and offer a whole spectrum of salsas. Tacos were likewise fantastic - the chorizo were the star of the meal. This place also has excellent margaritas - not the cheap frozen style mind you. Ambience is great once you make the trek through the mildly scary staircase... Clean with excellent service.",

    "text": "As a transplant from California, I'm kind of a snob about Mexican food. About the best Mexican you can get in Pittsburgh is at Los Cabos (they do carne asada burritos right). As I understand it, the idea behind Casa Reyna is to serve more food from other parts of Mexico (that aren't close to the US border), and maybe that's so. However, I found that the food here just wasn't that... interesting. I mean, everything tasted perfectly ok, but it seemed to lack any real flavor. The chips and salsa were the one exception: as good as everyone says they are. But the rest of it, I found to be really kind of lacking. The ceviche had these tiny, tiny shrimp that just absolutely had no taste to them, for example. I don't get it; serve me some actual crustaceans and charge me more. The entrees were similarly bland; I had a fish entree and my girlfriend had a sort of pasta-like thing, which was the only thing that actually seemed to have some interesting sauce on it. Reyna was ok to try, but I doubt I'd go back there the way I go back to the better restaurants in Pittsburgh.",

I was very surprised after descending the stairs to find a very well lit, clean, and nicely decorated dining room. We were seated promptly upon entering. We tried two of the salsas Casera and Tomatillo Verde. Both tasted fresh and had good flavor, I was happy that they were not at all spicy as I'm not a fan of overly hot(spicy) foods. My main dish I ordered was from the Dinner menu, I thought that was cool that they were setup to make food from their Lunch and dinner menu. I tried the Traditional Moles since I thought it would give me a quick general sampling of what they can do. This dish contained 4 different mole styles. I don't know if they make their mole sauces in house but I would hope that they do... It was pretty darn good, the only complaint I had was that the Chicken in the chocolate mole was extremely dry. The serving size was pretty large and I definitely brought a portion home with me.  The service was outstanding and I can't believe how quickly they got our food out to us after ordering, the place did have about 4 other tables , by no means was it full but for a lunch you could definitely get done in well under an hour. The server was awesome, very knowledgeable about stuff they had to offer and was friendly and fast.",

I ordered the chips with two salsas, chorizo tacos, and mole enchiladas to split with my friend all of which were great.  One problem is that you can't mix and match the tacos.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, the hostess who seated us was friendly, and the host was gracious.   With drinks and tip, the dinner for two was less than $50.  Word of warning: If you're under 5'5\", your feet won't touch the ground when you sit in the chairs.  I chalked it up to the charm of the restaurant.",

The tacos seemed to universally use poor cuts of meat, meaning it was full of gristle and fat. My barbacoa taco came out cool to the touch, leaving me wonder how something that was slow cooked could have cooled down. The steak they replaced it with was hot, but also chewy. They did remove these entrees from our bill, but even with the pleasant staff, I'd be hard pressed to return. I'd rather hit up Las Palmas for a taco any day.",

    "text": "First off, I understand that sometimes an establishment can have an off dining experience, and I always take that into account when I go somewhere. Usually, I would be willing to try a place a second time if the first was less than expected. However, our experience (myself and my family) left a permanent bad taste in our mouths, and we won't be returning. To define our service as slow and mediocre would be an understatement. When we walked in we were seated promptly, but it took another 15 minutes before we saw our server. We were able to order our drinks, but the waitress had rushed off before we could blurt out our appetizer order. It took another 10+ minutes before she arrived back. We ordered the salsa sampler, which was okay, but we weren't very impressed with the overall flavor of any of them, a trend that continued to our main courses. After about 15 minutes without any tortilla chips left (for 5 of us a tiny basket of chips was brought out), we were finally able to get ahold of our waitress to bring some more out to finish the other half of our salsa, which took another 10 minutes. Finally, we could order our entrees, having seen our server about 3 times in the first 45 mins-1 hour we were there. It took another 35-40 minutes before our food came out, which was surprising as the restaurant was not dead, but had a less than packed crowd on a late Sunday afternoon. When our food finally did come out, 3 out of 5 of our orders were somewhat incorrect or missing items, not to mention the food was not hot and seemed like it had been sitting for about 10 minutes before being brought to our table. My mother actually had to send hers back to be heated up as it was room temperature at most. For the price, the portions were inadequate to what we had expected. The food was at most \"okay\". \"Bland\" was a phrase that seemed to be commonly passed around the table. After a two hour meal we had left feeling unappreciated and rather disappointed with the quality of a rather expensive Mexican restaurant. I would rate this a 1 out of 5, but I feel like people don't really take 1 star ratings seriously and as an over-reaction. I was really counting on a nice meal after walking around in The Strip for a while. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice, and displayed a cool collection of Mexican art with somewhat of a rustic feel, but that alone is not enough to choose this over other, better, Mexican cuisine in the area after a \"horrendous\" experience, according to my family. Sorry for the rather lengthy review. Recommendation: Pass on this one.",

I decided to go with the shrimp and steak fajitas Mexicanas combo. This was served with black refried beans and rice. I LOVE Mexican food and this girl usually has a burrito in hand but this dish was just so bland, ah well. The portion size was huge but I wasn't excited to take the leftovers home the way I usually would be.   My mother law said she was satisfied with her red snapper fish tacos and my husband really enjoyed his tacos al pastor (pork with pineapple, onions and barbacoa.)",

While I loved the decorations and the live guitar music the night of my most recent visit, I didn't enjoy the food and neither did my husband. We each ordered several different tacos (I got the al pastor and bistec) and I can't say any of them stood out. Honestly, I thought the flavoring was very bland. Adding salsa helped, but it didn't quite enhance anything enough to make the tacos taste much better. We also ordered a few appetizers that evening and weren't blown away by those either.   However, the margaritas were pretty decent so I do recommend coming here for drinks!",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife and her parents for lunch.  We ended up coming here because my wife and I had walked by here many times before and have always wanted to stop by but for some reason had not.  We arrived to Casa Reyna at shortly before 1 and proceeded downstairs.  At the bottom of the steps we were greeted by a hostess and then seated.  The downstairs here is a completely different world from the crazy traffic on Penn Ave which was nice. The floor is made up of tile and the walls are mostly wooden with some string lights hanging from the exposed I beams on the ceiling.  It's walls are decorated with fancy tiles and pictures of famous/historical Mexicans.  For lunch on this day our table decided to start out with the elote while I went with the Bistec a la Mexicana (skirt steak in a jalepeno sauce.) Our elote came out first and I had to admit that I was a bit disappointed by it.  Sure it tasted pretty good but since it was served with tortilla chips I was expecting more of a dipping sauce and less of individual kernels with some cheese on top.  A binder of some sort would have made it a lot easier and more enjoyable to eat.  After we had finished with the appetizer our entrees came out and mine looked great.  The steak and peppers were on one side of the dish with the sauce on it while some foil wrapped tortillas and a circle of rice were on the other.  I first tried the skirt steak in the sauce and thought it was dynamite.  It was rich and flavorful with a good bit of heat to it.  That made a perfect pairing for the steak which was cooked to a nice medium and was flavorful by itself.  I eventually ended up eating the steak and sauce in the tortillas which made picking it all up pretty easily.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed my entree and am curious what other of their dishes I might enjoy.",

They make the tortillas fresh, as well as a bunch of different salsas, and the menu spans a wide range from regular quesadillas to ceviche. They even had micheladas on the drinks menu, something I can't always find in Boston.   I loved what I ordered (I can't remember the name of it and their website is currently down) -- a piece of seared white fish topped with a jalapeno cream sauce, with black beans and garlicky spinach on the side. I'm not usually a fan of cooked spinach but this whole meal was delicious, and came together really nicely as a whole. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for good lunch or dinner on the Strip.",

Tonight's was lackluster for me.  Sigh.  Ordered an entree of 2 tacos -- one pork with some pineapple thrown in and one beef. Sounds good to me!  I always and I mean always like marinated shredded pork in Mexican restaurants.  Until now, that is.  It wasn't shredded.  It was little pork cubettes -- hard cubettes and without a marinated flavor I was expecting and ittsy bitsy pineapple pieces.  Not impressed.  And the beef?  meh..  And they were over-filled by a lot, meaning they weren't conducive to picking up and eating without having them make a mess.  I know I have liked the tacos in the past but think I ordered the mini tacos then.  Oh, well, the company was good as we met an out-of-town guest and enjoyed ourselves being in the Strip district, nonetheless.  The margaritas were good and my past visits were more memorable, thus 3 and not 2 stars this go-round.  As a side note, I've ordered from Reyna's outdoors setup on the street.  Those tacos and I believe the mini tacos at Casa Reyna were far better and a total delight.  Now I'm remembering why.  They were not overstuffed with ingredients and had cilantro.  Yes!!! Cilantro is what made them some of my all time favs.  But, tonight?  The overstuffed tacos were not a delight and were not in any way shape or design reminiscent of those and I can't recall any hint of cilantro.  What gives?",

    "text": "I feel like Mexican restaurants either have good food or good drinks... and rarely you find a place that has both. This place does well with the drinks, but the food not so much. Their menu is fairly small. It's pretty pricey compared to most Mexican restaurants and you get less food than similarly themed places. And the food just isn't great for the price. I think the salsa is really off there too. I also did not have cell service when I was there. Overall, just overpriced, average-at-best Mexican food.",

Although all their dips are awesome--guacamole and salsas are so delicious and different, definitely get a small sampler to try. Corn tortilla's and chips are made by the restaurant so you can guarantee you'll never be hurting for fresh ones. Vegetables are always fresh but they are so so bland and are typically nothing more than zucchini. Wish the kitchen would get a little more creative there!",

The ambiance was cozy and with a feeling of home. It is an environment I would like to spend time with friends and family. But this is not all! Food and drinks are very good too.

    "text": "I went to Casa Reyna nearly four months ago after a several year hiatus.  I am not sure how to write this poor of a review because I've never done so with as much emphasis on poor as this one.   I went with a group of people who all experienced lackluster service and agreed on bland tasting, watered down food. For a restaurant which, in the past, had an amazing reputation for their genuine, traditional Mexican cuisine, most - if not all - of my party left generally uninspired and unwilling to return.  Despite what appeared to be the same authentic, expansive menu (which excited me beyond words) we all felt the actual food (and slow, rude service) was a waste of our time and money.  I could go into positives vs. negatives like I feel most reviews should have but, to be perfectly candid, the only positive I can think of is the cool set up and decor.  Since this could easily turn into a catastrophically negative review on a public forum I will refrain from writing anything more than:  1.  I should have tried the True staple Nopalas (I have concluded that finding this on a Pittsburgh menu is extremely rare) and 2. Don't rely on Casa Reyna's previous reputation because, for whatever reason, things have dramatically changed (possibly explaining our terrible experience?) ... do yourself a favor and go someplace else.   Local comparison:  El Paso Mexican Grill Not recommended.",

My friend and I noticed their sidewalk stand because our eyes caught the sign that stated they were selling mexican chocolate gelato - which my cousin and I both absolutely LOVE - chocolate with a hint of cinnamon and the kick of chiles at the finish, what's NOT to love?  However when we realized that there was actually a restaurant in the basement below the shop so we decided to have an early dinner before indulging in a sweet treat.    The decor is fun and warm even though it's a little dark, overall it's very inviting an enjoyable place to relax with friends and have a drink and some great Mexican food. I have been back several times and have tried a wide variety of items from the menu.  I'm a sucker for guac made tableside and theirs did not disappoint - it was perfectly made and the avocados were just the right texture and the homemade chips made a single bite a taste explosion on your tongue!  So delish!!  On my first visit I had the Shrimp Azteca soup and the veggie enchiladas.  On other occasions I've had the shrimp tacos and the potato and chorizo tacos, the chiles rellenos, and the gorditas.  You really cannot go wrong - the food has always been fresh and the service friendly and fast.  Oh, and if you have room, absolutely try their homemade gelatos!  If you love ice cream then their gelatos will be sure to please!",

Anytime I am in Pittsburgh I look forward to going there, as it has always been outstanding authentic Mexican food.  This time was an extreme disappointment.  Started off with chips and salsa and they were out of 2 of the salsa selections.  Their house salsa came to the table pureed and warm in temperature and was extremely bland.  The table side guacamole was not made at the table and looked like it had been sitting for a while and was also bland.  The tacos were run of the mill that you could get anywhere and the sides were in tiny condiment dishes.  Beans tasted burnt.  Taco tortillas were dry and chewy and overall poor quality.  I don't think I will be going back.  So sad.",

We were in the strip and getting hungry.  Fortunately I needed to make pozole so we found ourselves at the meximart at lunchtime.  It was too cold to sit outside and eat tacos so we headed downstairs for Casa Reyna.  It was a little funny, with the typical Mexican decor (wanted posters, corrugated metal \"roof\" over the bar, etc), but real napkins, etc.  We got the typical quesadillas for the kids and I got soup, my honey got tacos.  No free chips and salsa, but we ordered some and the chips were thick and crunchy and the salsa was small but good.   Then the soup arrived. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOh.my&s=98edab0cb2c458afb9b59a25bbadcf0054149a3363212accbb9e496ac87121c5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oh.my</a>.god. So it's now my new favorite.   Honey's tacos were good, the quesadilla was \"meh\" so we'll order something different when we come back because I loved the soup and we're going back.  I'm sure I might eventually order something else, and I'll report what everyone else gets, but for now (and for probably the next six months until this baby stops making me throw up) it's soup for me. (Ok, so the menu had a lot of your authentic options like four different types of mole, chilaquiles, regional dishes, etc - highly recommend if you want a better taste of Mexican cuisine.  They even had an elote dish as an appetizer, which I might get....with soup ;)",

The basement lends itself to a dark and noisy atmosphere, a nice contrast to the hot July afternoon. The service from here petered out a bit. Despite only being moderately busy, our server seemed to have his mind elsewhere. My friend enjoyed his margarita but had a hard time getting it. I was always left with an empty water glass.  The salsa and chips appetizer is great. The salsas are diverse and extremely fresh. The chips are slightly over salted. We had the mango salsa, salsa verde, salsa, rojo, and the cilantro based house salsa. They were great.   My entree left me disappointed. I had the carnitas tacos which were very under cooked. The meat was slimy. The refried beans were over salted to the point of being inedible. I could tell the ingredients were very fresh, which was reassuring.   I'll go back and hope they had an off day at the grill and with the salt. This place has a ton of potential.",

The service was great, the drinks were beyond generous and the food was SO authentic. I'll make the drive at least once a month to see my husband that happy.",

    "text": "So they apparently just opened a restaurant and are usually a Mexican grocery store. First of all, LOVED the set-up of the restaurant. Long, family style beautifully crafted tables. Nice ambiance, spacious and yet still cozy. Secondly, huge margaritas for very reasonable prices. And last, but not least, the food is bomb. Super authentic. Price range is pretty size-able, so there is something for most peoples budget's. I do wish that they didn't make you pay for chips and salsa (I feel like those should come free with purchase of meal(s)!!) and the service could have been a little faster, but those are my only minor complaints.  It was nice to have a relaxing dinner out with friends while on vacation - and it was awesome to see the (normally picky) kids eating foods they might not usually try!",

I suppose we have become accustomed to eating more than we should, so I can deal with a smaller amount than you would receive in other restaurants.  My check was $18.73 plus tip.  I just don't think it was worth the money.  I will not be returning.",

The queso dip was great and the margarita was just the way I like it STRONG! I would go back but to try something else on the menu. I see a lot of complaints about the service. I will say out waitress was fine. Checked on us and refilled are water when needed. I'm only giving this a 3 out of 5 for the tacos. I will go back and try something and then I hope to add another star.",

Excellent selection of tequila. And now the tacos....... as an individual who grew up in Texas I always enjoy a good taco and Casa Reyna's tacos are incredible!!! The brisket is probably the best brisket taco I've ever had and I am 51 so I've had a lot of tacos around the world.  Additionally the queso fundido was also incredible. Every thing was great an no complaint...... period!!  Try it and you will not be disappointed",

Began with the guacamole and salsa with fresh chips.  The guacamole is creamy and has chunks of tomatoes with a little kick, delicious.  Salsa is fresh and pairs nicely with the guacamole.  Chips are made fresh!  Shared the shrimp quesadilla and 2 steak tacos. Both were well seasoned and so tasty.  Nothing was left on the plates.  House margarita is also delicious - definitely worth a try.",

It's bright enough to see friends, but invokes a cozy warm mood to me. You have to walk downstairs to reach the restaurant and I was really surprised at the amount of space the restaurant occupies. I wasn't expecting to see such a room from the outside.   The restaurant prides itself in making its tortillas in house. The tortillas are wonderful and don't get soggy on a taco since they double up tortilla shells.   The queso dip with chorizo was a little bland for my liking. The elotes also had too much mayo in my opinion and lacked flavor.   I appreciate the condiment bar that is help yourself. I was able to get just the amount of limes for my tacos. I got the lengua and al pastor tacos which were tasty and were generously filled.   If you're in the strip district and want Mexican food, I would recommend this place because it's usually open, convenient and had a decent amount of options. However, if you're looking for delicious Mexican food with quality service, look elsewhere.",

Despite only having 5 or so occupied tables we had to wait 10 minutes to be acknowledged by a staff member and after being seated and waiting 15/20 minutes the same individual came and asked if we needed drinks. We didn't order food until about 45 minutes after entering the business. However, the food came very quickly and it was all very good. Our server seemed to be the only one for the night and was running around. I think that with appropriate staffing I would have a much better experience.",

However, I was disappointed over all with our experience.  To start off when we got there we stood at the podium for at least five minutes before a staff person approached us. Which we realized would become a trend.  Once we were seated our waited, who was really friendly, gave us our water. However, he didn't come back for some time to take our order. After our meal we asked for our check and it took almost 15 minutes to get it. I understand slow service when business is busy but this restaurant was practically empty. There were probably about 3 other tables occupied when we there.   Not only was the service disappointing but so was the food. We ordered chips and queso with chorizo. When the waiter brought the dish to our table I was sure it was going to be delicious. It looked amazing! But it had no flavor; definitely not worth the price tag. For ten dollars for two tacos I had so high expectations. I ordered one barbacoa and one carnitas. They were also bland and a little soggy. They came with rice and beans. I was surprised to find that the rice had peas in it.   I really wanted to like this place but the service was too slow and the food was overpriced and underwhelming.",

While we didn't go inside and sit down, we did take time to sample a taco from the stand just outside the restaurant...what a great decision!  We tried the steak taco, and it did not disappoint - very fresh, full of flavor, very tender. The queso fresco (I think?) added just a touch of creaminess and saltiness to the bite that was...pretty much perfect. Price wise I think it was about $5-6 for 2 tacos? Not bad at all for the quality. Condiments were available to add to taste. This is one of those times I wish I took a picture, but it was raining and we were in a bit of a hurry. There were a couple of benches to sit on but they were uncovered.  A great snack while perusing the Strip. I'd stop by again!",

I was a little skeptical since it looked empty but once we went downstairs there were a lot of people inside. The quality of food was superb and tasted really authentic. Though there are a few different latin type restaurants in Pittsburgh, this is the only authentic Mexican restaurant here that I've found. I've ordered the same thing (Steak Suadero Tacos) both times that I've gone because it was so good- and quite a large portion. The flavor of the tacos is unreal. I can't speak for the rest of the menu but that and the margaritas were to die for! Will definitely be returning.",

There were 2 seats left at the end of the table and unfortunately they did seat someone there but we decided to ignore it. We ordered the tableside guacamole, and this is not what made the restaurant 5 stars. It was literally avocado and tomatoes lol REALLY could've used some cilantro, salt, and much lime juice. But then we ordered the elote dip... again it left much to be desired and had minimal seasoning but we mixed it with the guacamole and it made the appetizers better. The chips were good. We ordered the mimosa margarita and the strawberry moscato margarita. The mimosa one wasn't bad but it would've been been if they hadn't use Brut champagne. It needed sweetness. The moscato one was great. Both were HUGE. For our meals, we ordered a taco salad (you think its going to be in a taco shell but it literally has mini tacos on top of lettuce), and the breakfast burrito. The burrito was AMAZING and that was solely because of the potatoes on it. The salad was good but I still wish it was in a shell. I was already full anyways from the large amount of guacamole and drinks. Also, beware you will have no service on the bottom floor! I think I would go back again though.",

I haven't been there in a while, so I stopped by to taste their authentic, delicious Mexican food that I've been craving for months.   As soon as we were handed our menus, I noticed something different- their menu changed!! And actually in a good way. I was mind blown when I saw that they have ALL-DAY MEXICAN BREAKFAST. YES PEOPLE. BREAKFAST. I'm a breakfast food lover and I'm especially into Migas and Huevos Rancheros!!!! I really hope that they keep this menu because I want to try their Huevos or Migas sometime.   Despite being tempted by the all-day Mexican breakfast offerings, I knew in my heart that I truly wanted a tamale. I had the tamale dish and it was OUTSTANDING. I love the chocolate mole sauce!!!   Casa Reyna's chips are also outstanding as well. They make the chips and tortillas from scratch, so you always know that they are NOT coming from a bag. The tortilla chips are the best tortilla chips in the city, in my opinion. (2nd place is El Burro) The guac is also very fresh and wonderful, and it is made tableside. Salsas are excellent too.   Overall, if you want authentic and amazing Mexican food, go to Reyna's. You will not be disappointed. Everything has so much flavor and is fresh. Prices are reasonable too. And there's always something for everyone here!!!!",

I overlooked how a simple dish like tacos could have their own spin on them yet still capture everything one expects from the traditional Mexican affair.   I recommend the enchilada, tamal texano and tamal oaxaqueno tacos! Possibly the best I've had in the city. We'll see if anyone can top this!",

When I dined here this summer, I had just come from California (and I live in a heavily Mexican part of Chicago) so I know what good Mexican food is, and I wasn't expecting to find it in Pittsburgh.  The carne asada was FIRE. RICO Y BIEN COCIDO. The generous serving of perfectly-seasomed meat - which I think they may grow on their farm - is SO FRESH AND JUICY. Carne asada is pretty much the indicator of whether not a place knows how to do Mexican right.  When in Pittsburgh, I would DEFINITELY  come back to Casa Reyna - even though I eat Mexican food several times a week back home.  Forget the haters and come here to really enjoy yourself con sabor autentica Mexicana.",

    "text": "Short review for a short visit to the new Casa Reyna restaurant attached to the fantastic grocery store located upstairs/next door.   We stopped in for some chips, salsa and tacos after a long drive to town and experiencing the Incline. We sat at the bar since it was in between lunch and dinner and no one was really there. The chips and 2 salsas (salsa roja and peanut/guajillo) were pretty awesome. The roja was spicy and fresh and the peanut/guajillo was sweet and savory at the same time and a nice change of pace. The chips were fantastic. Thin, super crispy, practically perfect and made from scratch in house.   The tacos were solid but inconsistent. The corn tortillas were fresh and tasty and doubled up on each taco. Carnitas was easily the star of the show with plenty of seasoning and properly cooked with slight crisp and very tender meat. The lamb barbacoa was well cooked but didn't offer much in the way of flavor or salt beyond the meat itself. Definitely needed some spice in there. The least successful was the lengua which was unfortunately chewy and lacking the the luscious texture I love in great tongue.   Pleasant interior feel, very clean and comfortable. Good overall experience and I'd highly recommend stopping in to give them a shot.",

The atmosphere was really cool, it definitely looks like a neat little Mexican place. I went with my boyfriend so there were only two of us for lunch. Even though the place was half empty, it took a good 10 minutes before the hostess noticed we were there and seated us. My boyfriend and I both ordered tacos with no appetizer. It took longer for our entrees than it did the table of four next to us to get their appetizers and entrees! When our tacos finally came, they didn't have much flavor. We were very disappointed. I couldn't even finish my pork tacos because they tasted so bad. The food was way overpriced for the quality and portions. They wanted $24 for one enchilada! No way! To top it off, my boyfriend and I had stomach aches for the rest of the day. We will not be coming here again. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because of the cool atmosphere. We would have been better off going to Taco Bell.",

It took forever to get my water glass refilled and with somewhat spicy salsa, that's kind of important.    The worst though was my food.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce (enmoladas I think is what the dish was called).  I really love good mole sauce but this was not it!  It was absolutely terrible which ruined the entire meal for me.    My kids ordered the steak tacos.  The meat was very tough and hard to chew, especially for children.  It also had very little taste.  This is not a place to which we will be returning.  I am not spending that much money on bad food and so so service.  The two stars are mostly just for the chips and salsa.",

The atmosphere here was cool as I walked down the stairs into the basement,. The staffed seemed really nice and friendly.  I tried the Jalapeno Tilapia.  which is served in a cream sauce over angel hair pasta.  This was such an amazing choice.  The fish was so tender and just fell apart so nicely as I cut into it.  the sauce was a great blend and the pasta was perfect as well.  I wish I was a bit more hungry so I could enjoy more of the meal but I plan on warming back up here shortly for lunch.  For not being a big fan of Mexican food and venturing into trying something out of my ordinary, Casa Reyna made it a very rewarding adventure.",

I am 6'2\" and they were high for me and they have this weird dip to the seat so that pressure is applied to the back of your thighs cutting off circulation to your legs. We waited for our server to approach, and we waited. There were two servers very slowly clearing and resetting tables while one poor haired server was handling all the customers. A very long story short food was bland and tasteless. I ordered the shrimp tacos with the chipotle cream sauce on the side. The \"tacos\" were nothing more than boiled water logged shrimp with fresh chopped onion and way too much cilantro. Very disappointed in the whole experience. Food took too long to come out, was bland and tasteless,customer at other table was arguing his bill, music was too loud, and my personal pet peeve ... Air dryer in the bathroom but you had to turn two door knobs to get out of the restroom area which is just gross to me because not everyone washes their hands when they are done.",

Since the initial device took so long we ordered all of our food at once. In the time it took to get our food one table had arrived, been served, and left and another that arrived after us was on dessert. When we asked to see the manager we were told he wasn't available because it was too busy. When my steak did arrive it had been sitting under the heat lamps so long it was inedible. I seriously hope they can turn this place around and take a good hard look at the service they provide.",

We had three orders of barbacoa at the table, one was good two were bad and even the good one was not as good as Chopotles.... Stringy dry chewy bland lamb...   The cactus salad and beans were very good.   The homerun here was the beef tounge, outstanding fork tender with a flavorful salsa verde. I would return and order this with beans and cactus salad. Dessert....good not great...flan was actually too thick and rich... The tres whatever cake was a little cream cheesy... Some tweaks here and these desserts could be come back kids. Out wait staff was very pleasant and good.",

The table we sat at had remnants of garbage from the last guests. We were pressured into ordering the guacamole in addition to the chips and queso. Both were very tasty. We decided against getting entrees as we were so full from the apps. Server (Axel) decided to push ordering entrees after we repeatedly said \"no.\" He was obviously annoyed and ripped the menus off the table yelling, \"looks like you won't be needing these!\" We had to ask multiple times for boxes and only got one box for all the food we had. When it came time to pay the check was slammed on the table and the server waited right there anxiously as if we we're going to walk out without paying. Everything went from bad to worse after deciding against an entree. I would never return to this restaurant. We felt super uncomfortable and immediately regretted our dinner choice.",

The chorizo were greasy and deliciousness wrapped in corn tortillas.  I ordered the Reyna Enchiladas as my entree, but to be honest, didn't like them enough to even finish.

Then I got even more excited, because they have a version of Tiramisu made with tequila.  As disgusting as that might sound, I could not WAIT to put it in my mouth-hole.  Sadly, they were out of both items.  Completely out.  That's not why this place has 3 stars, however.  It's a perfectly fine Mexican restaurant, but it's a little pricey for the kind and amount of food you get.  I got tacos that, normally, I could get with better ingredients from my local food truck - and I'd get three tacos instead of 2!  Also, the menu makes pains to express \"Lettuce and tomato is not normally part of a traditional Mexican cuisine, but can be added per request.\"  To me, this sounds like a kind of snobby authenticity game that is meant to shame the consumer.  Maybe I was being overly sensitive at the time and reading into things.  But, if you want to make traditional style food, just do it.  Don't apologize.  Perhaps their clients had a lot of complaints or something, but, again, if you just put it out there, the customers you want will come.  Otherwise, it was a nice meal.  A great selection of salsas of unique varieties.  I don't think that I'd head back, though, because nothing was that memorable - and the strip district has much more to offer.",

Our meals came out quickly and our server was attentive.  I ordered the enchiladas verde and thought it was okay. It was a little lacking in the flavor department. The green sauce was good and spicy, but the shredded chicken inside the tortillas was very bland.   My husband got the chorizo tacos and really enjoyed them.  We had the guacamole as an appetizer and I thought it was good. We actually ended up getting a second order and devoured both! The chips were freshly made and delish.",

They just opened, so I'm hoping they are just working out some kinks.  The chips and salsa were great, but the food was just so-so.  I ordered a tamale, and the husband ordered some mole enchiladas--neither one of us thought the food was bad, it just wasn't our favorite.  The portions are also pretty small for the price, if that's something that bothers you.  (I didn't leave feeling hungry, I'm just saying.)  There are some really unique/authentic dishes on the menu compared to the usual Mexican places around town.  I ordered a glass of wine and he ordered a beer--another table had margaritas that looked awesome, so I think if we come back it will be a drinks/appetizers situation.  It's downstairs, kind of dark, romantically lit, and has an old-school Mexican vibe that makes you feel like you're going to run into Zorro or something.  Definitely would be a good date-night spot if you're adventurous!",

Explore the salsa sampler and you won't be disappointed. As expected, the chips and tortillas are both excellent.  For atmosphere, Casa Reyna is also a nice place. You can tell that they took their time getting the restaurant ready. The murals, the decor, the vibe...awesome. The only downside? Don't be surprised when you get zero cell service in the restaurant. The plus side? You'll finally be able to focus on your actual restaurant experience since you won't have the outside distraction. Unfortunately, the lack of distractions also means that you'll KNOW when something is off...and that's why this rating is so low.  Service may have only been bad on our last experience, but it was infuriating enough to make me not want to return, despite the other decent experiences. When we order a skinny margarita on our first four visits, it's safe to say we MIGHT know how they taste. We MIGHT have been told how they make them by the previous waitstaff upon asking. As customers, we MIGHT be \"right,\" regardless of whether the bartenders agree or not. The simplest approach is to work with us to make our drinks enjoyable. Make your customer happy...you know...so we stick around and want to return again and again. Not argue with us. Not try to act like we may be stuck paying for a drinks that we barely took sips from. We stopped in to watch the World Cup, get a few drinks during the game, and enjoy some tacos. Instead, the arrogance of the bartenders made us walk out the door, disappointed, and with our money remaining in our pockets.  Hopefully Casa Reyna tightens up the bar service, but I don't see us checking back in to see if it's improved.",

    "text": "Finally! I've found a good Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh! I'm from Southern California, so I was raised on amazing Mexican food - and this is really good.   I started out with a margarita - which came in an awesome shaker. It was pretty good, but I've noticed that margaritas out east are A LOT sweeter than margaritas in SoCal. If I want a perfect margarita ... I'm going to have to make it myself - at home.   Instead of getting entrees, my mom and I ordered multiple appetizers. We got the mini taco plate with fish and shrimp, sweet corn tamales, the sope with vegetarian toppings, and rice/beans. The tacos were amazing - especially the fish. The sweet corn tamales cakes were just okay, not bad - but definitely not good. I've had tamales before and sweet corn tamale cakes - and they have never had cinnamon like these did. Just not good ... If you want really good sweet corn tamale cakes, go to Cheesecake Factory (do they have those out here?). The sope was good, but a little crunchy on the bottom - not sure if that's how they are supposed to be, but I've never had them like that before. The rice and black beans were good also.   All and all, I will definitely go back - and I will have the fish tacos again! I will try their enchiladas one of these days.",

There was one I didn't like; but, I think it was because it was spicy, had onions and just wasn't what I thought it would be (can't recall the name). Their appetizers are so good we recommend getting a few of those, sharing them, and having a margarita to wash them down. Their margarita's are HUGE. Two people can share one (our little secret). You would never expect such an terrific place in the basement of a store in the strip-but, worth the descend!! Good for veggies as well as carnivores.",

Was VERY busy on a Saturday evening, but you couldn't tell when you walked by-all you see is a door and a sign.    I didn't really like having to sit at a large shared table, some places do that and I don't care for it. I prefer my own table or booth, but considering how busy it was I didn't find it necessary to complain.  The menu was unique, a lot of seemingly authentic Mexican offerings.  A welcome change from the average menu of every Mexican place in a 50 mile radius (wet burritos, grande burrito, chicken quesadilla.....you get the idea.)  The price was fair and the portions were on the large side.  I'll always have a spot in my heart for the classic Mexican joint (can't go wrong with a Grande Burrito) but Casa Reyna will be my spot when I want something a bit more interesting.",

A variety of very comfortable, quality seating choices (high tops, long communal-like tables and traditional seating) peek into windows where tortillas are being made on an old-school conveyor.   Food is authentic and fresh, high quality ingredients. We have tried all the meats now and each was seasoned very tastily and expertly! A full bar lines one wall... so I imagine its lively on weekends!  From a California transplant, this is the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Since its inaugural year of 1988, Reyna foods has operated humbly as a mere grocer of Mexican goods, and for the past quarter-century, I had been completely oblivious to its existence. However, just this year, Reyna Foods opened a basement restaurant, something that may have been seen as inevitable to local patrons considering that a popular taco stand has been operating in the front of the business for some time now.   Facile to overlook during a ride down Penn Avenue, the subterranean eatery Reyna houses is a Mexican Wonderland, and the other evening, Kay and I willingly leaped into the rabbit-hole to celebrate that which is edible and of the Land of the Hot Sun.   Decorated to look like a cantina from yesteryear, aged wood, beer barrels, vibrant murals, and vintage photographs command the scenery.  Luis, dashing and deft, led us on a journey, playing the role of a Latin Cheshire Cat.   \"I'd like the Anchos Rellenos. Did I say that right? I had some Spanish in school,\" I said to Luis.  \"Not bad,\" Luis replied. \"Can you say this?\" Luis pointed to something on the bill of fare called Tamal Oaxaqueno.   \"Oh boy,\" I let out, much to the amusement of Luis who provided service of the highest caliber and with the utmost class.   A blackened shroud of an ancho chile pepper was buried in a bloody coat of a smoky mole poblano and stuffed with ground beef, pork, potatoes, and onions. Rice and refried beans were served on the side. Funereal, dark flavors usurped my tongue, the dish's spices smoldering like a pyre yet failing to overwhelm the starches and proteins. The rice was immaterial, but the refried beans, something I'm usually averse to, were pure comfort on the palate, surprising me with their flavorsome. chili-like quality.   A Salsa Sampler with Reyna's housemade corn chips and some guacamole began the ceremony of the senses. Served in a faux newspaper cone, the chips were extraordinary in their kettle-cooked texture and were more than tasty enough naked. Kay chose one salsa, and I another. Kay's Sweet Mango was a treat fit for stuffing fruit pies or topping globs of ice cream. Quiet notes of cilantro and onion could be heard amidst the glorious sugary, citrusy din made by not only pureed mango but peaches as well. My Casera salsa was also a success albeit a lesser one. Blended tomatoes, cilantro, onions, and jalapenos mingled together in what was a sublime slow burn of a party in its own right, yet I kept going back to that Sweet Mango.   The guacamole was a buttery, chunky tribute to that exquisite yet humble superfood with green chiles, tomatoes, onions, crema, cilantro, and lime making it sparkle.   The dessert known as Tequilamisu nearly intoxicated me with its alcohol content. This Mexican take on tiramisu was a sinister seducer of a confection, its strawberries bulbous, its creamy innards indulgently soft and saccharine...  Thankfully, Kay couldn't finish her kinder and more delicate Chocolate Tres Leche cake, a much milder angel of a pastry than rescued me from the corruption of a strumpet with hard liquor in her veins and bad intentions on her mind.  Casa Reyna takes a cuisine that is humble and turns it into something bold and gourmet without sacrificing its soul. When next you find yourself in the Strip District, willfully fall into Reyna's merry underworld and experience everything Mexican food can be.",

    "text": "Holy mole! There are few things I am too lazy to try to make for myself at home, but mole is one of them.  A good, traditional mole sauce has more ingredients than my attention span can handle and the fake stuff that comes out of a jar (or that is served at any of Pittsburgh's other \"Mexican\" restaurants) just doesn't make the cut.  Imagine my excitement when I got to Casa Reyna and saw that the menu not only includes a traditional chicken mole, but a total of FOUR different moles all wrapped up into one beautiful sampler dish.  I wish I remembered what they all were, I know in addition to the chicken there was a mole verde with tomatillos and poblanos served with the most succulent pork ever, a beef with some kind of red mole, and a fourth that really could have been made of anything (I really have no idea) but I do know I would eat spoonfuls of it.  In addition to my obsession with this sauce, I loved everything about Casa Reyna.  It was like the stairs took you through some magical tunnel and transported you right to a cantina in the middle of Mexico.  I loved the ambiance and decor, our waitress was fabulous, and I didn't even mind the thirty or so pictures of Frida Kahlo staring at me while I ate.   Our table started with a salsa sampler.  I always say you can tell how good a restaurant is going to be by the bread (or in this case chips) and accompaniments you get at the beginning of the meal.  Casa Reyna was off to a great start with crispy, warm, non-greasy chips and four amazing salsas.  Obviously, I LOVED my entree (see above if you've forgotten) and everyone at the table cleaned their plates and filled their bellies.  Another huge plus is that even though Casa Renya is in the Strip, they have- wait for it- NORMAL RESTAURANT OPERATING HOURS. I know I shouldn't be so excited about this, but I was worried they would follow the trend of everywhere else I love to eat in the Strip and cater to the daytime working crowd, forcing me to take personal days from work just to indulge in an authentic Mexican eating experience.  Now I can eat here any time I want, and plan to take advantage of that frequently!",

    "text": "I love Mexican food, I have eaten at so many establishments I could not remember them if I tried... but this place- This place will go down in my gastronomic history. Everything was flavorful, well seasoned, and fresh. A lot of Mexican places opt for processed ingredients that lead to overly salty dishes without a lot of spices. Not Casa Reyna.  For starters we tried two salsas, and the queso fundido. The salsas were pretty good, and the queso was delicious. We got ours with the chorizo, and it added a nice flavor without overwhelming the rest of the dip. Even after we finished our entrees we went back and finished up the queso. The chips were crunchy, sturdy enough to handle dipping, and they had a nice flavor without being crazy salty.  The entrees came out quickly and were visually appealing. I ordered chicken fajitas, which were served in a hollowed out, grilled pineapple half. The meat was seasoned, but not overly spicy, and was served with grilled onions, bell peppers, and pineapple. I really liked the addition of the pineapple. It came with your typical fajita toppings and a size of rice and refried beans. Normally, restaurants will serve you bland and old rice and beans with the expectation (I think) that you won't eat them anyway. The rice was delicious and still tender and fresh. The beans were the best I have ever had at a restaurant. I ate them all! It was served with fresh, home made tortillas which rounded it out really nicely. The others ordered the Quatro Moles dish and the flautas, which were made there, large, and looked delicious (I didn't have the chance to sample around).   We decided to order dessert which I was hesitant about because, again, normally desserts at Mexican restaurants leave much to be desired. But I am so glad we did. We tried both of the desserts they offered that night, the flan and the chocolate ice cream. I assumed the ice cream was your typical food service delivery in a five gallon tub, but it was a creamy, icy Mexican chocolate concoction that I can't get out of my mind. The flan was sooooo good, as well.  The service there was prompt and friendly enough. Our food came quickly, she checked back throughout the meal, and our dishes were bussed and waters filled as often as I could hope for. I would not say that our server was bubbly or insanely extroverted, but I don't dine out to befriend the wait staff. Make sure I have what I need and I will tip you well and we both win.   In short, go here. If you like Mexican food and have tried as many places as I have in search of a meal that is entirely satisfying, you won't regret it.",
