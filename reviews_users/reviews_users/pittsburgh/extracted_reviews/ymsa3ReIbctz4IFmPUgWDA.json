I usually get an 8...  a 6 was perfect.  My hubby went down a level as well and it was perfect.  Our server was very friendly and paced our orders with  the kitchen so our food came out hot and fresh.  Would give 5 stars except that there is a ventilation issue.  It is a small place so when the kitchen is hopping, the smoke filters into the dining area.  Fans and an open door helped.  We will definitely go back and hope for some outside seating or takeout and head to Shelley Park to eat outside.",

The entrees however were outstanding. The green curry was delicious (my favorite green curry is pusadee's garden) and this was a little better. Definitely far better than Bangkok balcony's. The vegetables were nice and crispy and the biggest surprise was the beef, really tasty and good quality. Same to be said for beef with broccoli. Can't wait to try all the other dishes here, this will be my go-to Thai place to pick up.",

    "text": "Was here a couple of times for take out.  So far everything has been great.  Highly recommend their Som Tum and Yen Ta Fo.  The Som Tum really did taste like I was having it out of a street outlet in a Thai night market.  Yen Ta Fo was fragrant and brimmed with many different types of proteins and veggies.  There were some exotic ingredients too like cow liver and tripe, as far as I can tell, which IMO added to the flavor and texture but if you are not into those I guess you can ask them to be taken out.  More common selections like Pad Thai and Pad See-Ew are also very good, although the Pad Thai is a little bit on the sweeter side.  Personally liked the Pad See-Ew better.  Perfect balance and flat rice noodles were springy (not mushy) like they should be.  Some day I'll sit down here.  There is an interesting gentleman from the UK manning the tables who has promised to tell me a story once I do.",

Smell was strong enough to permeate my clothing, which I had to air when I got home.

Clearly, the owner knew how to make use of each ingredient. The kee mao was extraordinary, making ample use of fresh green peppers, and hints of basil throughout.  The dumplings were tender but not mushy,  with a flavor that was easy on the palate.  I don't know what happened with the previous place, but I can assure everyone that this place will easily overcome the restaurant across the street as squirrel hill's best authentic Thai food :)",

It was a little weird having the cook walk through the dining room to the basement to get food items.

I followed that with the peanut pad Thai which was analogous to a religious experience - surreal. The gf had cashew chicken which was incredible.   To cap the gluttony, we ended with mango sticky rice. Authentic and spot on.   It's a shame this place opened a month ago and we're moving in a month. Amazing place.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by this dining experience. I am a big believer that dining is only partly about the food you are eating and is also highly influenced by your environment; and the environment here ruined our meal. A couple minutes into our dining experience all of the customers started coughing because something was severely wrong with their exhaust system. Every time you breathed it felt like a mixture of smoke and horrible spices were filling your lungs. I honestly felt like I was choking for most of the time there. At one point it was pretty comical because all of the women just kept looking at each other in the dining room while everyone was choking.   All of that being said I really hope this was a fluke experience. The waitstaff there were really nice and in theory the environment could be nice minus the air problems.   Now to discuss the food. We started with spring rolls which were really fresh; except there should have been more sauce on the side. I had the Pad Thai which was really scrumptious and a generous portion. They claim to be very authentic Thai food. So essentially that means that a 1 level spice there is actually a 3 or 4 somewhere else.   To sum this all up, I don't plan to dine in here again, but I will definitely order take out.",

    "text": "Definitely a must try in my book. I had the Yentafo (Pink noodle) that was on their menu cover. Best Thai noodle soup I've had in Pittsburgh. Soup was spot on to what I'm used to this did tasting like in California. I ate half of it and was way to full to keep going. If you're a meat lover this dish came packed with giant chunks of pork, amazing calamari and shrimp (and fish balls which I opted not to add).   The Thai tea was one of the best I've tried. Sweet but not to sweet with a lot of flavor.   My date ordered the Minced pork with Basil. At first he really liked it, but midway through he thought it was too salty. I personally thought it was great. But I only took one bite.  Food came out pretty quickly but I definitely think for a Saturday they should have two waiters.   I deducted 1/2 a star because they still hadn't fixed the hood, so with the door closed it did get pretty smoky in there, but not sure why they didn't open the back door instead of the front door. And with the door open it was freezing cold.   Also lost 1/2 a star because we ordered an appetizer that he forgot to put in the computer. We weren't upset b/c he seemed very busy being the only waiter on a weekend. Also, price point was a little high. One noodle, one rice, and one drink set us at $33.17 with tip we spent $40. I hope they can survive with so many other restaurants on the street. It would be a shame to lose this gem.",

But Thai & Noodle Outlet needs to stay and you need to eat there! Located on Forbes Avenue next to the Carnegie Library this small, pleasant space seats probably about 25 people and is BYOB.  Service is fast and very friendly and I have a feeling you could have a nice date here or enjoy an evening with friends. My group of three started out sharing the appetizer Tofu Paradise.  And, you know what, as far as tofu goes, it was its own little paradise!  This is a great app to share and the tofu was fried lightly with no grease or oil to be seen and topped with a tasty peanut sauce.  Personally, I think it could have used a little more sauce, but it was likely the perfect amount.  For my entree I had the pad cashew nuts noodles.  It had a great heat to it and the noodles were a perfect flatness seasoned well and accompanied by fresh vegetables.  I ate every last bite. My friends also enjoyed their meals - we all agreed that it was spicy but not in a  \"HELP my mouth is on fire!\" way.  The price was reasonable and seriously, the service could not have been better.  I can't wait to return.",

I've tried the Pineapple Fried Rice, along with Pad Thai and a fusion dish with Spaghetti noodles. Please be careful about the spice; they're right about it far surpassing any assumptions. However, the dishes are extremely well seasoned and incredibly balanced - the spice adds an intense amount of flavor. Will definitely be back here more than once",

If he didn't know the answers he asked the chef. Plus he had a great smile and energy.  I ordered the Pad-See-Ew with shrimp and fresh roll.

    "text": "I tried looking online so I could find an email address that I could write to about my experience instead of posting a review.  There wasn't one so I decided to call the store to speak to a manager but this was the exchange:  Is there a manager available that I could speak to? No Is there an email address I could write an email to? No there's no email Do you know when the manager will be back in so I can speak to them? No, maybe tomorrow.  So today was a bad day in Pittsburgh.  I think everyone is a bit on edge, and when I was leaving work all I wanted was to grab some noodles before heading home.  I wasn't sure if they would be open due to the shooting earlier in the day so I called ahead.  They were open and took my order and told me it would be ready in 10-15 min.  What they didn't say was that the roads were completely blocked off and there was a candlelight vigil being held less than 100 feet from their door, making it nearly impossible to get there.  A trip that should have taken less than 15 min to park grab food and leave ended up taking more than an hour.  If they had told me when I placed the order I would have been grateful for the information and would have gladly returned on a different day, because I liked the dish I had there before and was anxious to try some new things.  By the time I realized what was up I had already walked several blocks and invested way more time and effort than I would have liked, so I carried on thinking at least the food will be worth it.  When I finally got home (I live an hour outside of the city), I was really looking forward to chowing down as I'm 5 months pregnant, had gotten out of work late, and it took and hour longer than planned to get food.  So I took a huge bite and found my \"mild\" noodles were made spicy.  I had gotten two entrees just to be safe, but the 2nd mild dish was made spicy as well.  And well for me at least, spicy food + pregnancy means unbearable heartburn, so basically it was all for nothing, I couldn't eat either dish.    Any of those things (not being told about the road closure, the food made wrong, or the unhelpful phone exchange) wouldn't have been that big a deal by itself.  It's frustrating but shit happens. Just all of it together, and the fact that they didn't ask once on the phone why I wanted to speak with a manager, makes me think that they don't really care about customer service.",

He was screaming and running around as if the restaurant was his living room. It wasn't until he had a total melt down that they took him out. I found this utterly ridiculous. I do not go out to eat to be disturbed by a child of an employee. Additionally an employee was on his break I guess watching YouTube videos loudly on his phone. We were the only people in the restaurant, but we were dining in, so I am not sure why they thought any of that was acceptable   Again, food was pretty good, but Pittsburgh is full of good Thai places that do not have screaming children in them and have better prices.",

The service was pretty good 4/5, constant water refills.  Finally, the food. We ordered a see-yew (spice level 3), pad thai (spice level 0), and pad peanut sauce (spice level 5). The spice level is out of 10 and is very spicy; the pad peanut sauce at 5 was overwhelming but still edible. Everything was also too sweet to be authentic. The pad thai we ordered was too sweet that it became inedible after a couple of bites.  The food here wasn't very special taste-wise, just too sweet to our standards. They do, however, have a large variety of food entrees ranging from rice, curry, and noodles.   tldr; atmosphere 4/5 service 4/5 food 3/5",

    "text": "This is honestly the best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh. Apparently, the owner of this place also owns Thai Cottage over in Regent Square.  The food. For both dishes we got a spice level of 7. Compared to other restaurants where I've ordered a 7, this is definitely spicier... so stray on the side of caution if you can't handle spice.   We got the minced pork basil on the chef special list. For reference, I'm pretty sure this is called pad ka prao in Thai. The pork had a perfect balance of 3/4 lean pork and 1/4 fatty pork. I looked up a recipe for it to make at home because it was that good. It is kind of expensive for the ingredients they use in the dish though ($15 for minced pork, basil and an egg).   We also got the thai pho soup with beef. This was also great. The noodles aren't your typical pho noodles. They were thin rice/vermicelli like noodles and absorbed the flavor of the broth really well. The broth was spicy, sweet and sour. The meatballs tasted like those beef tendon meatballs you put in hot pot (mmm) and the beef was tender.  We went on a packed Friday night around 7:30, and there was only one server, one expo and no hostess. I understand that the place is rather small, but they seemed a little overwhelmed. The service was still quick, and their staff was amicable.   **When we were there, it seems as though their ventilation wasn't top notch. Anytime anyone got a really spicy dish, the whole dining area would fill with deathly spice fumes causing everyone to cough. Maybe more than a curtain between the kitchen and dining room would be a good idea.**",

    "text": "I stopped by here earlier today with my wife for lunch.  Even though Thai & Noodle Outlet wasn't supposed to be open until noon we saw an open sign on the sidewalk and snuck in a few minutes beforehand.  The inside of the restaurant feels nice and clean with hardwood floors and pink and brown walls.  There is seating for 32 (6 - 4 tops and 4 - 2 tops) and some paintings decorate the walls.  Our hostess/server was bubbly and very nice which made us feel very welcomed.  For lunch on this day I decided to go with the Sukthothai soup, spice level 9.  The menu described the dish as Sukhothai broth with minced pork, roasted pork, peanuts, bean sprouts, scallions, cilantro, fried garlic, and crispy wontons.  Just in case I needed it spicier, they had a tray of three different spices on the table, salt, dried red pepper and a liquid one which I didn't recognize as well as some fish sauce. Whenever the dish came to the table I was pretty excited about it.  I first tried some of the roasted pork and my eyes started to water due to the spice.  However once I mixed it up the spice level of the dish became perfect as it was spicy enough to make me feel/taste it but not overwhelmingly so.  The broth here was fantastic too as it's depth of flavor brought some sweetness, sourness and spiciness which paired nicely with the peanuts.  Actually everything in the dish was quite flavorful and I was impressed with the amount of food as there was an almost ridiculous amount of noodles.  This meant that I actually had trouble finishing it and was absolutely stuffed by the end of my meal.    The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Both my wife and I absolutely loved our food and thought \"it hit the spot\" and our hostess/server was really nice too!",

    "text": "This place has been a favorite for a few specific Thai food options since it opened about two years ago. They have a fairly standard and large menu, but where they truly shine are in the soups, curries, and noodle salads.   The Tom Yum and Tom Kha they make are richly flavored and satisfying. A bit on the salty side in a good way. I've never had another tom yum in Pittsburgh that makes me smile and grin and laugh while eating it. It's that good!  After many visits I can say that the larb and glass noodle larb are excellent. Their limited curry options stand toe to toe with the local masters at Nicky's Thai.   I can't say I've enjoyed it all, but it's a big menu. As others have pointed out, their pad thai takes a departure from fresher brighter flavors of citrus and scallion and instead is based on a much darker earthier oiled flavor. Not my favorite. But the things I've had that they do well more than make up for this and have kept me coming back consistently.   Decor is standard. Dining room is always clean. I have sometimes had issues with service as there are times there are hired servers that are very quick and attentive and other times where I have felt ignored. It's a small family business so I give them some slack. Bathroom is down in the basement and fully stocked and clean.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite Thai place in Squirrel Hill!  Service is fast, friendly, and very informative. The older gentlemen who helped us gave us recommendations, and seemed to really love the food they serve there.   Food quality was very good!  The sever warned us about their authentic spiciness levels from 1-10, so whatever I get at a Thai place that does American spice levels, I should order two down. Well, I heeded his warning and where I normally get a 5 other places, at this place I choose 3. I can take my food pretty spicy, so if you don't like your mouth consistently burning, heed his warning!  They're not joking! My friend thought he'd ignore the warning and got a dish of the chefs special pink noodle shrimp, and asked for it a spiciness of 6, which was toooo hot for him.   The pork pad see ew is a winner and a go to of mine. This one had the biggest chunks of pork I'd ever seen come in this dish!  I saw a girl order the pad Thai, and it was HUGE! Good portions here. My partner got green curry with chicken, which was pretty good but needed more veggies in it to go along with the lots of chicken. Very tasty.  Their Thai iced tea was good but very sweet. Only $2, which is the cheapest anywhere in Pittsburgh.  Their Thai iced coffee was too sweet, couldn't taste any coffee and is served just like the iced Thai teas are.  Again, $2, good price.   A lot of dishes are $11-12, chef specials are $14-17, and there are up-charges depending if you get a more expensive meat / protein option.   Parking on Murray is street parking you have to pay for, and it can sometimes be hard to find a spot right out front, but it's an easy walk from any direction, once you do.",

This was for dinner so the total price came out to be $16--I thought this was a lot for the amount of curry given.  We came in at an off hour, so there wasn't anyone there, but the place was very clean, had sauces on each table, and the staff was very friendly! Service was quick as well   We got the curry at a level 6/10 spicy. I was nervous at first because I wasn't sure if their level 6 was actually spicy but they delivered! It was a nice change because a lot of places don't deliver on the spice, but this was great! I would only recommend getting above a 5 if you are more used to eating spicy food because they actually do a very good job of making it spicy. The only thing about the panang was for an entree, I wish it had more meat and vegetables and tasted more nut-ier like panang usually does.   I would still come back to try their different foods, since we only got one thing on the menu but definitely come try this place out.",

    "text": "This is an improvement over the old Sukhothai (and certainly the other Thai places in Squirrel Hill) for several reasons. First we appreciate that the tables have their own mini sauce / condiment bar of various vinegars and chili pastes, which allow customers to customize dishes to their liking. Second, their focus on noodles allows them to serve a number of items that are not always found in the typical Thai restaurant, but at the same time they also have enough non-noodle dishes to satisfy any craving.   So far we've sampled a few dry and soup noodle dishes. The dry dishes are quite good--in terms of taste, preparation, and ingredients they compare to what you can get at some of the better Thai restaurants in the city. The sukiyaki noodles were interesting since I'm not sure that it's available elsewhere. Good mix of glass noodles, vegetables, and meat, all with a very tasty sauce. But the noodle soups seemed to be where they excelled. While we have only tried the boat and sukhothai noodles, we found both to be very savory and satisfying. The broths had lots of flavor, the noodles were done perfectly, and there ample amounts of tender meat and vegetables. Definitely go for the soups for something different from what you'd normally get at other places.  I do wish that they have the noodle soups for lunch portions, and you might want to be wary of the ventilation there--the smells of the different dishes can be quite strong and often waft all the way to the door! Waiter service was very friendly.",

Don't let the name or signage throw you off, this place is a Gem in plain sight with a title that almost turns you away- Don't let it, you'd be missing out. The spice smacks you in the face as soon as you walk in, you'll cough or sneeze but you'll acclimate just fine and after your meal, you'll feel that you should open the door to the 80+ degree Thai weather outside.   I recently visited Thailand and since have yearned for a less westernized version of Thai food here at home. This place has it. The key indications of authenticity were presented moment by moment from the second I stepped in the door. The spice in the air, the picture of the King, the essential condiments at every table, the strong smell of Kapi(fermented shrimp paste) as soon as your dish hits the table, the proper sticky level of the rice,  the higher spice levels- This place is a piece of Thailand in Pittsburgh.   Albeit, it is a wee pricey(dinner prices + Protein) for Pittsburgh standards, the portions are almost certain to leave you with leftovers and a smile on your face- Plus they use all the right ingredients, no BS here.The presentation is lackluster, but who cares if it tastes good. Service is friendly, fast and informative. I recommend the mango curry. It is cooked with the under-ripe mangos so it isn't over sweet; AKA it is done right and mouthwateringly delicious.    I will be back so many more times.",

This place replaces a different Thai place that I gave poor reviews to, so I am glad to see that it is much improved over the new ownership.  The food was delicious and plentiful.   A tad more pricey that I would have expected with the protein charge; but it was two meals for me, so it evens out a bit.  We were warned by the server that the spice levels are authentic and he said he puts in one level lower as a rule.  I thought mine was good as served, but probably could have gone to the level I asked for.   The mango sticky rice is a favorite for me, so I was glad to see it on the menu.     Four stars instead of five because the space could still use some work.  Gone is the smelly carpet and old feel; however, it was so HOT in there that I was sweating before I even sat down.  It was also really loud, which made conversation difficult.  They need some ventilation and AC in there for sure - I'll stick to takeout in the meantime.",

    "text": "I have to admit, we didn't come sooner because we thought the Yelp reviews were fake. But no, I think they are real. This is, hands down, the best Thai in Pittsburgh.  The restaurant really does smell like Thailand with pungent fish sauce and hot pepper aromas. I fell in love immediately.  Usually, I test a new Thai restaurant with their pad thai. After all, if a restaurant can't manage an adequate rendition of their country's most popular street food, I'm pretty sure their curries will be creamed into oblivion and their tired veggies will be poured from cans.  Based on smell alone, I did something a little different. I ordered a basic red curry (still a good barometer) and their spaghetti variation on drunken noodles, because I was curious what they were thinking.  The dishes came out beautifully prepared. The spaghetti with reds and greens of fresh peppers, little bunches of green peppercorns and still-green kafir lime leaves.    You could taste that the ingredients weren't pre-cooked together. Each flavor represented a separate layer on the tongue. I particularly loved the lime in the spaghetti. While I wouldn't order the spaghetti dish again, it certainly wasn't execution that was the issue - I just prefer a more traditional noodle.  I ordered a 10/10 spice level and it was exactly right and the spiciest I've managed to get in Pittsburgh (I usually try for a 15/10 and get served something that's closer to a 3).   To answer the question that's on everyone's minds: this is NOT just a rebranding of the previous restaurant. I just hope they can keep up this level of quality over time.",

Even though it's a smaller space, I came here for dinner with a group of 6 and had no problem getting a table. All of the food came out quickly and was delicious, and we all took home leftovers!  I got the Pad Kee Mao with tofu, and man, it was delicious! Tons of noodles and the tofu was fried well. Their spice level was pretty accurate too. My 4 (out of 10) had some lingering spice but definitely wasn't overwhelming, and they have spices on the table in case you want to add some more. I liked that it's BYOB, and only 50 cents per person!   I took off a star only because the bathroom leaves a lot to be desired. It's in the basement which heavily resembles a frat house basement. It made me a little worried about how they keep the areas that customers don't see. But the food was delicious nonetheless and I'll definitely be back many times!",

Ordered the lunch portions, but couldn't even finish my food because the portion sizes were so generous. Service was quick and friendly. The shop is pretty small, but very clean. The atmosphere was nice. Highly recommend this place!   While we waited for our food, we each got a small serving of a soup with tofu and vegetables for free, which was light and a bit sweet. We shared the tofu paradise appetizer between 3 people, and it was delicious. The peanut sauce was the perfect consistency and was not overly sweet. The vegetables that came with it were also perfectly cooked, and the tofu was crispy as advertised. I ordered the garlic vegetable dish with tofu at spicy level 6. It was amazing! Everything was cooked perfectly. The amount of rice was perfect for the amount of vegetables. The flavor was great, and it was super spicy. Be warned if you don't like spice too much! My friends got the tofu with eggplant and the pad see-ew, both of which were also delicious and very spicy.   Everyone was satisfied, and my bill was only $11 for all that food. The menu was so long and there are so many more dishes I would like to try. Can't wait to take more friends back here. This may be my new favorite Thai place, especially for lunch!",

I was craving pho and they had it on the menu. We had crab rangoons for appetizers which were pretty delicious. The service was quick and simple. My pho soup was amazing! I briefly wished that it had jalapeno and lime like Vietnamese pho does but it was still really good, and I'd happily order it again! The dining room is rather small but even when we arrived, there were multiple tables open that quickly became filled. For now on, I'll just come here.

We ordered the summer rolls, tom yum soup with chicken, steamed dumplings and Pad Cashew Nut Noodles with beef. All dishes were just extremely subpar, except for the summer rolls. The soup was so sweet and had way too much fish sauce. We couldn't eat it. The dumplings supposedly were pork with celery/water chestnuts/onions/scallions. They just tasted like frozen ground chicken steamed dumplings. I could not taste any of the other mentioned ingredients. The noodle dish was so greasy and had absolutely no flavor. The ingredients had no stir fried char on them that you get from cooking in a wok. The noodles were mushy and all broken up. The beef was fatty. Ugh, just a sad plate of food. When we told the waiter, he said \"Oh\". That's it. No offer of a refund, nothing. Needless to say, we will NOT be returning to this Thai restaurant.",

The tangy citrus of good pad Thai wasn't there either, and it also wasn't that spicy. The chicken was really well done though, so I was glad with that.

I ordered the pork see ew 0 spice level and my friend got the chicken pad Thai 3 spice level. We also had the chicken satay and some Thai iced tea and Thai iced coffee. I'd say the most outstanding part of the meal were the drinks. They were sweet and satisfactory and only $2!   We ordered takeout and the satay looked a bit suspicious since it seemed small being concealed in an aluminum foil wrap. Unwrapping it revealed a few chicken skewers to pair with the two sauces in the box. The pad Thai actually had a lingering spice at spice level 3. So if you're someone who can't take spice, my advice is to stick to a 0. I do wish there were more veggies and meat in the noodle dishes. They seemed to be mostly comprised of just noodles and grease.  Overall, I wasn't impressed but I wasn't disappointed or put off in any way. Just an average Thai joint.",

Our waiter and waitress was phenomenal. I can't even remember what I ordered, but it did taste fairly good. The portion sizes are huge and everything is very reasonably priced. I tried soup with tofu in it for the first time and was pleasantly surprised that I liked it.",

    "text": "In my quest for the best pad thai in Squirrel Hill, I finally got around to trying it here.   It was a larger portion that at least two of the other places nearby. And it was a fair price at $12 including the chicken.   I also got the sweet sticky rice. But, I wouldn't actually recommend either dishes here. The pad thai was good but at least two of the other nearby locations were better. The sticky rice was microwaved with sticky sauce ladled on afterward.   If this were the only option I would probably come again, but with the number of options in the area it's at the bottom of the list.   The staff was extremely friendly however, which goes such a long way to making a place fun to go to. So I want to leave this review on a positive note because of that!",
