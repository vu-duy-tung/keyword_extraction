We had drinks, dinner, and shared a dessert.  I feel that it was quite overpriced for the sizes of the entrees (sea scallops and the seafood trio) and drinks (wine & a martini)...otherwise I would have given 5-stars.  My mom's entree was barely lukewarm...a bit cold even, and we had to send it back...although we dread doing that.  Mine was great though and so was our choc cake/rasp sauce.  Our waiter was very attentive and humored my sometimes overbearing mother.  Thanks for a nice evening out.",

    "text": "Went there with friends for a Thanksgiving meal.  There was a group of us.  The service was horrible - server gave my drink and food to someone else in my group and then proceeded to give me someone else's check.  The food was cold and we learned that they ran out of food and had to go out to their other restaurant in the Southside to serve us.  THIS WAS AFTER WE HAD A RESERVATION FOR TWO MONTHS!  We waited 2 hours to get served.  It wasn't that they didn't know we were coming.  And when we complained about it all they said was \"Happy Thanksgiving.\"  They smirked and acted like we were doing us a favor -- If the restaurant was closed on that day they would have made no money, instead they made a fortune off of us - my check was $35 x nearly 30 in our party!  Took my money but gave me crappy food that was worse than a TV dinner.  This was my first time there and it will be my last.  If you are bragging about being open on a holiday then give first class service -- EVERY DAY -- shame on you for not telling us that you were having problems and at least offering to substitute another meal.  Shame on you for even calling yourself a professional restaurant.",

It was cooked perfectly (it's hard to cook a piece of meat that small correctly), also all three (yes three) of the stuffed shrimp were quite tasty. My girlfriend liked the shrimp trilogy, but  we found the side veggies overcooked and bland (HINT: a pinch garlic and a dash of salt will work wonders guys).  I will go back and try some of the appetizers and soups, but I left the place disappointed and still hungry for a steak. Places like this are exactly why I learned to cook a steak at home.",

Luckily the sweet hosted found us a 6 top in the bar and I was told our service would be the same as if we were in the dining room. It took over 20 minutes for us to even order our drinks. There was ONE server and ONE bartender for the entire bar side. We saw multiple people come in and proceed to leave because no one was getting waited on. We had to ask for water 3 times and order our drinks in multiples bc it was nearly impossible to get our servers attention and she would forget our order the second she left our table. My boyfriend got served the wrong drink twice and the kicker was that she insisted that is what he ordered rather than apologizing and getting the correct one. Our food was cold, and mostly incorrect. We were charged $5 extra for a plates that werent even on the menu. It took 2.5 hours and a $140 bill to have the worst service and experience downtown I've ever had. Never once did anyone apologize for the wait or the incorrect orders. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!",

    "text": "Restaurant week review!  We were seated at a table for two without a wait at 1pm, and the lunch time deal was for $20.15 (+ tax, tip).  I ordered:  Blue Crab and Roasted Corn Chowder (Fresh Roasted Corn, Chili Oil, and Chives) - This was very creamy, and it had the right amount of crab pieces.  Northwest Salmon Saute (Wild Mushrooms, Asparagus, Hazelnuts, Fresh Raspberries, Lemon Cream Sauce) - This reminded me of a stir fry, but the chunks of salmon were the right and best kind of crispy on the outside. The cream sauce complimented the vegetables and salmon very well.   Mini Molten Chocolate Cake (Heath Bar Pieces, Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce) - I love Heath bars! The whole dessert was very rich.  And not included in the restaurant week deal, we ordered the Lump Crab Tower with avocado, mango, and orange vinaigrette. This dish was a mix of interesting flavors, which the waiter described to us as \"light and refreshing,\" which it certainly was. The whole chunks of avocado might have been my favorite part.   Excellent service. The only criticism I may have is that the interior and atmosphere is similar to a dimly lit hotel lobby.  I have seen that they have happy hour specials, so I mean to return!",

We really liked the shrimp and tacos, but the hummus and ahi were a miss. The hummus came with fried pita that was burnt and soaking wet with oil, and the ahi was... well just terrible (fishy, overcooked, gross). The tacos could have used some spice, but the shrimp was great.  I would go back. Other menu items looked really good too.",

    "text": "We made a reservation with ease, very friendly phone staff. Arrived to celebrate my children's (age 12) first stage performance. We were seated right away, however, we were seated in a back room, more like a conference room (we had a table for 5), no music, one other table seated in the same room. On our way to said conference room, we passed through the open and airy, crowded and lively main room. Why we were in a conference room?  No matter, we ordered, all of us getting steaks, filet and ribeye. One person ordered a filet medium well and the other a ribeye, medium. Food and drinks took FOREVER to arrive and our snippy waitress didn't come back to see how our food was for quite a while. Well, the filet (medium well, for my 12 yr old daughter) was medium rare, at best. My Dad's ribeye was RARE, cooked only on the outside. So, they sat there for a while until she finally returned. We told her of the issue, no apology from her, irratated at best (does this happen often?), took the plates and said they would cook it more. Hmmm, ok. The rest of the table was finished with dinner when the server brought back the other 2 plates, seriously, it took over 10 minutes to bring it back. STILL WRONG!!! My daughters was much better (the filet) but missing her truffle butter on side and the broccolini on the plate now cold. My Dad's (ribeye), they must not of touched, cold and still rare. We asked for a manager, told of our complaint, and he apologized and said he hopes we visit again in the future. WHAT??? No, we will not be visiting again in the future, $300 bill for lousy food. Some celebration!!  VERY DISAPPOINTING!",

It was extremely busy and packed in the bar area.. can you blame anyone? TGIF right? The food and drinks took a little while to be served.. well over a half hour.. but like I said it was extremely busy and I had a feeling our server was new. If you want to experience McCormick & Schmick's happy hour, I'd suggest it not being on a Friday.  Bobby and I stopped in yesterday to enjoy happy hour (a Wednesday) It wasn't crowded at all and we enjoyed ourselves. I wish I had taken a picture of the happy hour menu. It's ordered by price ($3.99, $4.99, ect) & everything is under $6 or $7. There are a few options for each price category. They have nice options too! The drink menu is similar. During my first trip, I ordered a margarita. Last night, I had a glass of Chardonnay & Bobby enjoyed a glass of Merlot. Don't judge us, we know it was \"bottom-shelf\" wine for the price that we paid, but we enjoyed it, haha!   Last night, I ordered the burger & fries ($3.99!) I enjoyed my meal and bobby enjoyed his calamari.   You're missing out if you've never experienced their happy hour! It's from 5-7pm M-F",

We had an hour before we both had business calls to attend, and with the sparse crowd figured that we would be a non-issue. While the food was spot on and delicious the service was slow and lacking that special vibe. I asked for a cup of ice when the waitress refilled my tea but was jut happy in the end to get her to come get the checks so we could get back to work. Bottom line food is good but you need more than a lunch hour to enjoy!",

    "text": "Have been at this downtown location, as well as others, many times over MANY years. I have to say, it may be time to call it a day & night, McC & Scmick's!!! I was lured in by a outdoor sign claiming a 3 course crab dinner, only to be told it wasn't the \"day\" it was available. Why put out the big placard-on which NO restrictions were visible?       But, hubby and I were hungry for seafood, it was cold and windy Saturday, so... we were seated poorly, even though there were plenty of nicer booths and tables. We were dressed professionally & acted properly. What's up with that, guys? Our table had goo on it, felt greasy, and the cocktail menu appeared to have some dried barbeque type sauce on the glassed front. I cannot abide dirty!       Well, onward-our waiter placed two filthy paper menus on our table and proceeded to reach across and remove the other two place settings. As he did this, I noticed the 55+ gentleman had on a VERY dirty tie -they are always black and gold striped here, and his looked so filthy I wanted to throw up. He also had no sense of humor. When pouring our $60+ bottle of wine he was cheerless as we remained happy, positive, and smiled our way through the tasting/pouring. But, I came for the seafood, so on we went...I ordered a cup of overpriced lobster bisque and my companion had the bowl of clam chowder. Both were okay. Just okay and kind of insipid. I've made better at home.       Our entrees follow, with the scallops my husband ordered being just fine, though a skimpy portion for the price. They were good though. My crab cakes were simply a disaster. They were not \"lump\" but pureed beyond belief. I expect for $33.00 two cakes that are full of sweet lumpy goodness. Not so. Small pureed cakes, no lump meat, skimpy corn, tomato, onion coulis on top of one/not the other, sides of plain green beans and rice that had a fancy name and was just cold- white rice with a couple minced bits of red and green pepper! Take the 2 sides away-that's a buck there: I know, I cooked prof. before. It took up most of the plate! That's a big trick.      The two 3\" diameter, 1\" high crabakes were tasteless and the texture was paste. Never again--$33.00 for that. No.       Husband, because his scallop dish was okay, wanted an espresso to get us off and on our way home. So, ok...and, cool, he wanted creme brulee. Oh yum! Maybe, salvation? I asked if it was REAL creme brulee-with eggs, heavy cream, etc. The waiter said yes, it was indeed housemade. Out it comes at a whopping dessert price; lovely berries on top, nice crack of sugar...and...it's a mix. No eggy, rich custardy brulee. I know real and mix. Come on, McCormick and Schmick's. This was plain awful. I left with a huge bill. I could have gone up the street and bought a sculpture I saw earlier that day and I really liked... for the price of this sorry, pathetic dinner. Never going back. Ever. Dirty, humorless, expensive, not on trend, poorly prepared. 'Nough said.",

Service was good, if a little aggressive on the upsell side. She said she was new.  She didn't know the menu as well as she should, but I'm sure she'll learn it. We found her very entertaining, so it made up for any inexperience on her part.   I think the food overall was, 'meh I've had better.\" Got the cobia with forbidden rice.'I found the fish to be rather bland and the rice overly sweet.   The presentation could've been better, too.    I'm giving mcCormick and Schmicks three stars, which is higher than the review would indicate, only because I've not eaten there before and the space is cool and the location is good.

Then another 10 minutes for us to get those drinks!!!  My overpriced steak and bland cheddar fries got cold waiting for a very small glass of wine!!  Which was $12!!!!!!!!! The Lobster bites were awful!  $20 for a few chunks of deep fried lobster chunks. Fish and chips rival Long John Silver. The ribeye was small and dry. Just a very very disappointing experience.

We arrived early & was happy to find two seats at the bar until they were ready for us. Ordered two prosecco sangria's. Made fresh with a lovely amount of fresh fruit & cucumber. Tasty & delicious. Although be prepared to pay dearly for this drink. Well worth it for me. After such a cold long winter a fresh summer like drink made me happy!   Calamari was our appetizer of choice. Lightly battered piping hot & served with two sides. Tender & delicious!   I ordered the Idaho Rainbow Trout, grilled. Hands down my all time favorite fish. I was looking forward to this since I've not had trout in some time. Not disappointed! Two beautifully seasoned grilled filets came out on a bed of mashed potatoes & fresh green beans. I proceeded to make a happy plate!   My friend ordered the shrimp mac-n-cheese with andouille sausage. This came out creamy cheesy & hot with a perfect mix of gooey yummy cheeses. Andouille sausage has a nice zippy heat to it as well. She made a happy plate too! Much to the amusement & possible shock of our waiter Alex. We assumed most people can't finish it & take most home.   Speaking of our waiter Alex. He couldn't have been anymore attentive or jovial. Very knowledgable about the menu. Joked & teased us. We never felt neglected or lacking anything. He was fantastic & we left him a nice tip for a job well done!   We both agreed the price versus quality of food & service was by far worth every penny. We happily paid our bill with no regrets!   All in all a most pleasant night out!   There is a large selection of desserts. We ate so hardily  we didn't have room. But they looked very good & I know I'll regret not trying at least one!  Oh! Bonus! There are two parking garages within a walk from this place. No excuse not to try it out!",

Alerted them to their accusing us of walking out on our checks when we did not, then charging our card the wrong amount. All this after a four hour miserable wait and experience. I have also reported the manager Dan who has handled this so atrociously that it's astounding he has a job at all.   Please: do not eat here or support this business. I venture to guess they will be closed soon anyway; especially after the business bureau begins investigating them.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to the SOUTH SIDE location last night looking forward to the Wednesday Happy Hour special of $1 oysters.  We got there at 6, went in and grabbed 2 seats at the bar.  The bar was reasonably busy but the restaurant was dead.    The bartender immediately came over offering drinks.  We ordered 2 draft beers and asked about the Happy Hour menu.  She acted almost turned off when she realized we were only there for HH.  We ordered Bruschetta for $2.95, Mussels for $4.95 and a plate of 10 oysters- 5 Blue Points and 5 Choptank.    The food came out nice & quick and we were set.  The Blue Points were big, meaty, sweet & delicious.  The Choptanks were small but still tasty.  The Bruschetta was a bit confusing with diced tomatoes mixed in with halved cherry tomatoes.  It proved a feat just to keep it on the baguette slices.  The Mussels were more of a 'small plate' than a full order and they were boring and bland- cooked in butter & garlic.  With all the better restaurants going to fancier more complex tasting but just as simple dishes- we were not impressed.           Noticing my beer was empty, the batender offered another.  She was quick to offer drinks at the bar... but as we looked around we noticed just about every other table in the bar area loaded with empty glasses and patrons all seeming like they were ready for more.  There was a stretch of about 20 minutes where not a single server came around to check on those tables.  Thank god we got seats at the bar.  We couldn't tell if it was the bartender's job to wait those tables or not, but we couldn't tell who was responsible for this area and it was definitely neglected.    Our plates were empty but the Blue Points were so good I was going to order 10 more- when I find good seafood I usually go for seconds...  But 10 minutes go by and our empty plates are still in front of us, I decided to just interrupt the bartender and pay our 'passage'.    We would go back... but we learned our lesson- get seats at the bar, order drinks and all the oysters we're going to eat, then leave.  Don't expect good service, cause you're not going to find it here at the bar.    D&K",

The crab cakes came after quite a while, had to ask for bread, silverware and water.....the plate was hot but the food was not.....so bad for a spot that had a great reputation for service and good food",

I work in the area and come in once in awhile for a business lunch or happy hour, and I've never really had a bad experience. I find that the main dining room food can be pretty pricey, and I think there are probably more innovative/trendy restaurants in the area. This is definitely more conservative, traditional dining and I've never really been wowed by the food. The bar offers a great happy hour, especially for downtown where many places don't have happy hour at all. Overall, I'm sure I'll be back.",

    "text": "I would love to give them one star based on last nights Thanksgiving nightmare but my wife says I shouldn't rate them at all based on a holiday.  I think it's quite the opposite and they should have exceeded all expectations because it was a holiday.  They trashed my Thanksgiving.  It's a big deal.  If you aren't prepared to handle it, you should have let go of the greed and been closed.  I could write a novel about this terrible evening.  It was just one bad after another.    We came in a sat at a table in the bar area while we waited until our 7:30 room to be ready.  We were there with a group split into 2 large tables.  There were only 2 people working the bar area and that included running food and making all the drinks for the restaurant.  I gave up waiting and waived for a couple drinks.  We ordered Kentucky Smashes and they were very good.  The Old Blue I ordered later was a lot less successful.    At 7:35, I went to the host stand and they said a previous group was lingering and it would be 5 minutes.  I pressed him and asked if he was lying as I was starving and asked that I be seated in the main dining for dinner if it wasn't going to be indeed 5 minutes.  He insisted.  You all know what's coming next right?  30 minutes later!  We complained to a server while still in the bar and she ran and got us the first course while we were in the bar.  Kudos to her for seeing that we were desperate for some food.    The service in the private room was sparse.  No one asked me if I wanted a drink or checked back to see if I wanted anything.  No one asked us if we wanted coffee or desert after our meal which was fine because it took 2 hours to get dinner!  They ran out of food and had to go to another location to get us food.  I can hardly believe they wouldn't just tell us what was going on and offer us something else to eat.  Meanwhile, Chris, the manager, lied to me again when I asked about food and said it would be up right away. You should have seen the dried out tough piece of meat they delivered to my dining companion!  That thing should NEVER EVER have left the kitchen.  When we said something, he offered to replace it but it was 9:30pm!!!!  Are you kidding me????    The food was ok.  The green beans were raw, the squash and apple casserole was a puree.  There's a difference.  The gravy was really salty and unfortunately I added it without tasting it and my plate ended up salty.  Ugh.  There's so much more I could share here.  I will never ever come back to this or another of their properties.  EVER.",

    "text": "This was my 2nd visit to the downtown location and I learned that even though they are a chain and carry the same menu, this one and the one previously reviewed in the Southside are not the same.  We came to celebrate my neighbor's birthday after seeing a show. We were treated like princesses by our waiter named Tim. On our menus at the top were written \"Happy birthday\" on them. My girlfriend was pleasantly surprised.  She opted for the crabcake dinner while I opted for their salmon specialty of the day. Please note that when you come for dinner you don't get the option of adding a side salad for a small upcharge as you would for lunch. We got there fairly early and by the time we left the place was packed!  We got bread and butter and then our meals. She loved her crabcakes which came with a corn topping along with a pasta side. My salmon came with cut up green apples, asparagus and a pea sauce. I loved every bite of it.  She wanted dessert for her special day so she ordered carrot cake while I settled for flourless chocolate cake. Tim brought both desserts and sang \"Happy Birthday\" to her. Mine was not too heavy and came with a few berries on it. It wasn't overfilling. She said she enjoyed her carrot cake which was several layers.  Having previously secured a Landry's card which can be used at a few restaurants downtown I asked if it could be combined with my AARP card. (As noted before-if you show them your AARP card then you are entitled to 10% off your check). The Landry's card is a reward card which accrues points based on your spend and you get a $25.00 reward your birthday month and anytime your spend exceeds 250 points.  I had been told at the Southside restaurant that I could not combine both cards. Here I was told the opposite. The same thing happened when I was here two weeks ago when I was having dinner with another friend.  Tim gave us great customer service and we both couldn't be happier with our experience. They are open for lunch on weekdays but as we were leaving we saw a sign indicating that they open for lunch at noon on Sats. Considering the price for parking downtown we will return for pre theater dinners we have for upcoming shows. Located on Wood St near Piatt Place it makes a great place to enjoy seafood!",

It's a great place to stop in for some drinks if you work downtown. $4.50 domestic beers. $4.00 well mixed drinks and $6 wines and cocktails. $7 martinis. It's tough to find better deals on drinks downtown! When my friends and I stop in after work, Megan is typically the bartender and takes amazing care of us. Very friendly, quick service and delicious mixed drinks!  They also have a very reasonably priced happy hour appetizer menu, starting at $3.",

Both were excellent, only comment is could have used a little more garlic. Our daughter called earlier in the week and spoke with the general manager. He greeted us and was very nice. Since our daughter arranged this with him he comped the appetizer and dessert!! Would definitely go back.",

For starters our waitress Anna, was wonderful! She took great care of us. We ordered a bottle of Don Miguel Gascon Malbec. I have never tried Malbec before and I have to say I am a big fan. It went down smooth. We ordered the oysters rockefeller and crab cake for appetizers. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked the oysters. They were cooked with spinach, bacon, pernod, and hollandaise. The crab cake was also very delicious and was filled with plenty of crab. For our meals, I ordered the crab stuff shrimp with green beans and cheddar mashed potatoes and he ordered the ahi tuna with white rice. The shrimp was nice and meaty and the crab stuffing was appropriately portioned. I highly recommend this dish, along with the oysters rockefeller. They also have a rewards program that we were made aware of! It's $25 and each time you dine with them or any of their other restaurants (the list is a mile long) you earn points. Our next visit we get a free appetizer! This is definitely a great special occasion restaurant.",

    "text": "My boyfriend mentioned wanting to try McCormick & Shmick's happy hour with me several times over the past year. It's one of the only places he can make it to in time for a happy hour (he works downtown until 5:30 or 6:00 most nights) and he'd heard it was extremely cheap. I'm not a big on chains in a place like Pittsburgh with such great restaurant choices, however this past Friday I obliged him and we went. Coincidentally it was our first happy hour together after almost two years of dating.   We arrived and were instructed to seat ourselves in the bar area for the happy hour menu. It was around 6:00 on a Friday (the M&S happy hour is until 7:00) and the bar was full but there were about five tables free. It felt bustling but not hectic or overly crowded. I'm sure an hour earlier would have been a different story! Our table was equipped with double sided happy hour menus, so by the time a few minutes had elapsed and we'd been approached by our sever we knew what we wanted. I liked the convenience of that a lot. We both ordered the $5 happy hour burger and fries, with a well manhattan for him and a blue moon for me.   Our food arrived within ten or fifteen minutes, and I saw that my bun had unfortunately been very generously buttered before being toasted. I had to explain to our server, who kindly fetched me a new, I toasted one. I appreciated how understanding she was about the whole thing. The quality of the food itself wasn't terrible, however I can't see myself paying full price for it. The burger was extremely salty, and the lettuce on it was super cheap. Overall it was what I expected given the reputation of the place and the reviews I read before going. It's not anywhere I'd go for a special dinner, but I can see myself doing another happy hour in the future.",

It took a while to get my ice tea, and my salad showed up about half the size I usually get from other McCormick and Schmick restaurants (I've gone to several of them in Houston TX area). The salad had hardly any thing on it, too. The bartender told me that this salad was how they normally make it, so I asked to talk to a manager. At this point I had already planned to give feedback to the manager and then go eat somewhere else. It was apparent that the place was short-staffed, and there was little chance of getting good service there. The manager took a while to show up, but had a new salad in hand. She didn't seem interested in hearing what I had to say, and I walked down the street to Capital Grille, where I had an excellent experience.",

However, when we sat down we were told it would be a SHORT delay in getting our food since they were at capacity.   Ok, no issues we were not in a rush.   3 1/2 HOURS LATER we were FINALLY paying our bill.   Our waitress must have thought since she told us that there was a 'slight delay' when we sat down, we should sporatically get checked on.   Drinks were empty alot, and she ignored all the men at the table and only interacted with the ladies.   I guess she was afraid they would yell at her.   Once we did get the food it was warm at best and nothing to rave about.    I am so unbelievably disappointed in how we were treated, the quality of the food as well as the 'oh well, not my problem' attitude we got all night.   Went there to celebrate two birthdays, which were never recognized even though we told them, and thank you McCormick's for ruining them.   We will NEVER return, and our business will go to another restaurant this weekend to re-celebrate.    I truly hope someone from that establishment sees this and does something about it.   Your restaurant....is really bad and completely gone downhill .",

    "text": "My drink was tasty but that is as far as the good part of our experience goes.  Service was slow. At one point a server broke a glass in the doorway to the room picked up the big pieces and left the little shards there the entirety of our 2.5 hour service. After waiting an hour and fifteen minutes our meals finally arrived. NOT WORTH THE WAIT. Every single plate had food that was warm at best some of it actually cold. The $4 mash that came with my steak besides being an incredibly small portion for box quality potatoes was beginning to harden on he outside from sitting around so long. One of our friends was able to pick up the entire side of mash in one piece and flip it over without it shifting in shape at all.  I ordered the ribeye which is $37 it like everything served was cold I quit on eating it after one bite. I have legitimately had better $10 steaks at cheap bars. None of our 11 friends were happy with the food, four of us myself included immediately returned it, my first time sending food back at a restaurant, we opted to not have it remade as we did not want to be left waiting for another hour for food. The manager came of right away as the server knew while serving us that it was far below quality food. He took the food back after trying to argue for the food quitting when my one friend showed him the steak juice was literally dried to the plate. He took off the food that was not eaten and gave us all 25% off (not enough if you ask me) and never truly apologized and didn't really seem apologetic. I opted to go to the McDonald's nearby and got some hot food there. Save yourself some time and money and just don't come here.",

My favorite appetizer is the mussels. They are amazing! It's a must try. Although the portion is small, the mussels come in a tomato sauce with fresh herbs and toast. I also like their firecracker shrimp tacos. They are delicious!  You get three shrimp tacos.  I also come here during lunch. The dishes are a bit pricey but I enjoy every bite of it. I like ordering the shrimp Fettuccini dish. The sauce is not too heavy and you get big size shrimps.   Overall,  I really like this restaurant and come here quite often! Highly recommend it!",

The thing that really made me mad is the quality of the food. The crab cakes tasted horrible. They were mushy and lacked consistency. The fries were over seasoned, mashed potatoes we're runny and my steak undercooked. The creme brulee was not fresh and did not have the sufficient sugar crust. The only good thing was my drink which I needed  after the 400plus bill. I don't mind paying for a good meal when it's good! I won't be back. Very disappointed",

This Place is one of my favorite restaurants when I visit different cities, well I'm living here in Pittsburgh now, this is my 2nd time here at this location, I came for my bday (Jan 25) my Waiter, my food and the service was excellent...today not so much, this time I came alone and went to the bar area and sat to be waited on, I sat there 5-7 mins, 2 waiters walked by didn't say a word, I went to the hostess to ask for someone to come serve me, she went and grabbed a waitress and that worked out fine...well I do want to say my waitress is sweet, but not very knowledgeable of what's avail on the menu and do certain things come with the dinner... I ended up ordering the calamari and stuffed mushrooms... they were cold on arrival and I asked for my dinner to have asparagus and potatoes, I received green beans instead  and my ultimate trio was also cold when it was placed on the table (cold seafood isn't good unless its cocktail shrimp ),  I'm probably not going to come to this location again and try the one on the southside of town... thanks for the worst experience ever",

    "text": "If our waitress was not so nice, and if it was possible, I would have give this restaurant zero stars. We went there for Thanksgiving dinner and we're highly disapointed, not only in the food but in the atmosphere and in the management. Tables were extremely close together, (when my daughter, who is tiny, wanted to use the restroom people at two other tables had to stand to let her get up and then get back to her chair)  it was not decorated for the holidays and the background music was terrible. We try to go to a nice restaurant at least twice a month for dinner and this one was a mistake.      One of the people in our group of four is a vegetarian.  Before making reservations we called three times to inquire if they would had a vegetarian menu available on Thanksgiving. We spoke to a different person each time. Each time they assured us that they would have many options on the menu. We reserved and when they called to confirm we asked again. Again we were assured that there would be several vegetarian meals available.      When we were seated and looked over the menu there was not even one meatless entree available. I asked our waitress for the vegetarian options and she informed us that they DID NOT have any available. My first instinct, which I wish I would have followed, was to walk out then and there but there were no  restaurants with last minute reservations. She went to check with the chef. Returning she told us that they could boil some pasta. We told her it was not acceptable for Thanksgiving. She returned to the kitchen and came back to inform us that all aspects of the Thanksgiving menu, with the exception of the mashed potato, had meat products in them. She then offered a Flatbread pizza with vegtables on it. The vegetarian didn't want to cause issues so with disappointment ordered that and a side of mashed potatoes.      When the food arrived it was very dissapointing. Thanksgiving dinner was salty, presentation was lacking and the Turkey which had too much dry dark meat was not flavorful at all. One person ordered salmon which was good. The vegetarian meal was very marginal especially for Thanksgiving. What we order from our local pizza shop is much better and at least half of the price.       When the bill arrived it was $160. SO NOT WORTH IT!  We felt like it was money wasted. The small side of mashed potatoes was $6.99! At the very least, they should have comped them or her desert  after four conversations confirming they would have a vegetarian menu. Did they really need reservations so badly that they couldn't be honest?        Because our waitress tried so hard, and really felt bad about the situation, and because it was a holiday we gave her a generous tip and left NEVER to return again!  We have enjoyed other Landry restaurants but are unlikely to patronize them either. This waitress told us we were members of their reward program and credited what we spent to our reward account. She was the only one to do this after about 12 trips to the Grand Concourse, also owened by the same company. For us, there are too many other better options available than to go to this restaurant.      Please think twice before eating here, especially on a holiday!",

We were in a virtually empty restaurant on a Tuesday night, and I was served the most flaccid scallops I had ever seen.  The waiter did not even return to check on us until it was time to bring us our bill.  At that time he noticed that I had not eaten my dinner.  Did I want them to remake them?  No, not by then, because I needed to get home to the babysitter.  Could they comp me a dessert?  No, thank you, I would have preferred a dinner that I could eat. Horrible food AND service.

All of the patrons were well taken care of by the service staff. I got 2 rum & cokes sweet potato fries and fish tacos. My coworker got a burger and 2 rum & cokes as well. She loved her burger and said it as tasty. The sauce that came with the fries was amazing. Her and I typically mix BBQ sauce with ranch when we order sweet potato fries but this sauce that it comes with was delicious! The dinning area ambiance was dark and quiet. The bar area was typical of a high priced, restaurant's bar. Dark and semi-quiet. I definitely recommend them for happy hour and I'm anxious to try them from dinner.",

Their menu is quite extensive, changed daily to reflect seasonal fish and ingredients. I always choose something interesting from their cocktail menu, as they have a scratch bar with fresh ingredients.  McCormick's has some very good soups and several salads to choose from, although they cost extra to add to your entree. I will admit that many of their appetizers don't tickle my fancy. I do, however, love the crab dip. It is great for sharing. If you like oysters, they have over 5 varieties available on the half shell. Their mussels are also excellent.   If you are there for lunch, they have over ten entrees for under $10, which is a pretty good deal.   My favorite dinner entree is the Salmon stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie. The serving size is rather small, but the taste is wonderful!   They also have an extensive wine list and delicious dessert menu. Try the chocolate bag with passion fruit mousse and fresh berries. It's divine!",

Coming from the Chicagoland area I was excited to find a McCormick & Schmicks in downtown Pittsburgh. There happy hour menu is like no other restaurant or bar. Mainly, the best deal on the menu is the $2.95 cheeseburger. They also offer great drink specials as well as other food specials.  On this specific visit I was able to enjoy two locally brewed beers, a cheeseburger, and pierogies all for $13. You really cannot beat the prices to enjoy such high-quality food; especially when the happy hour is offered Monday-Saturday!",

I actually got the traditional fish n chips and they were pretty good. They served me 4 decent sized pieces of fish mixed in with an order of fries. I wish they gave you more fries, but overall it was pretty good and something I would get again. The fish was crispy on the outside and beautifully cooked on the inside. It was served with a side of spicy tartar sauce which I enjoyed. The service was good too. We had a party of 6 and they had two servers constantly refilling our drinks and checking in on us. I do think every meal is a few bucks overpriced. My fish n chips were $15.99 and $5.99 for a small cup of soup off the lunch menu. I don't mind paying for a good meal but, for the prices I would like more portions. I think their dinner menu is even more expensive. Inside they have a nice restaurant with a large dining room for seating. Good place to go!!",

    "text": "Went to McCormick and Schmick's on Friday March 21st.  We had a reservation for 9:00 PM.  It was father/daughter night and my \"date\" was my 13 year old daughter.  The restaurant was her pick and I have always heard good things about McCormick and Schmick's so off we went.  We were seated immediately upon arriving at 8:58 PM and the wait staff was quick and attentive.  The restaurant (like downtown Pittsburgh on a Friday night) was not very busy but that was ok because it made for a relaxing dinner.  We started with a couple of appetizers; a sashimi plate for me and lobster bites for my daughter.  The sashimi was served on a rectangular plate and presented very artfully.  It was a combination of salmon and some kind of whitefish and the temperature was very cold...this is a good thing, I am wary of sashimi if it's even CLOSE to room temperature.  I enjoyed it a great deal.  The lobster bites were apparently tail meat morsels dredged in a tempura batter so as not to extinguish the flavor of the lobster and served cleverly in the empty tail shell.  They were, according to my daughter, very good.  We continued with a bowl of lobster bisque for her and a wedge salad for me.  The lobster bisque was the richest one I have ever tasted.  Good, but rich.  My daughter ate some and saved the rest for take home.  My salad was simple, cold and delicious.  For entrees we had linguini alfredo with grilled chicken for her and a grilled cobia with forbidden rice for me.  The alfredo was perfect and the chicken grilled perfectly as well, my daughter enjoyed it and took home leftovers.  My cobia was grilled to perfection as well and served with, like I said, forbidden rice which is a black colored rice (its natural color) but doesn't taste unusual.  It has a bit more tooth to it than regular white or brown rice but was a great contrast to the fish.  All in all it was a very nice meal.  The missing star is because my daughter had intended on getting a lobster or king crab dinner and those weren't available.  I would go back but for me this is a once every 4-6 month restaurant and not a once a month place.  Not because of price but the food is not mind-blowing just really good.  Thanks for a nice dinner McC and S!",

A pleasingly cloistered, wood-warmed atmosphere in the middle of the Point's concrete jungle. TVs in the bar not are mute and not too distracting considering the scope and sweep of the large bar and wall of windows. Bartenders friendly, professional and quick. their computer clock runs a couple minutes ahead of time to cut off happy hour deals, so make sure to get your order in five minutes before the official end.",

We had 18 people and McCormick remained super flexible. We arrived around 715. There were very few people there around that time. Which was surprising for a Saturday evening.   Our table was ready for us when we arrived and the waitress was available and knowledgeable! The entire table enjoyed all of their food. I had steak with asparagus and sweet potatoes. I also had some delicious Brussel Sprouts. They were so gooood. For dessert, I had some delicious bread pudding. Not sure if there was alcohol in it, but the icing had a nice caramel and rum taste. It was so good.   The only downside was that they were out of crab when we went. On a Saturday night, out of crab, at a seafood restaurant? #thingsthatMakeYouGoHmm",

Upon entering the nearly empty resturaunt, we were asked if we had a reservation. No. We were walk ups.  They seated us just fine.   Our waiter seemed a little.. lost?  We placed our order - started with Coconut Shrimp. For $12.00 I certainly thought we'd get more than 4. Alas I should ask rather than think.  I then ordered a wedge salad, which was amazing.  We did order a Beer, but rather than it coming right out, it seemed to take a while, and was finally delivered with the apology of the keg being changed.   When our meals came out, Mine the parmesan crusted chicken and his the fish and chips, were satisfactory, save we had to ask for the tarter sauce, since his fish and chips were served with cocktail sauce, again, very strange.  The food was tasty, the chicken was cooked well, and the sides were yummy.   The prices were .. a bit out of range for what we got, and the service. They were very VERY interested on pressing me into getting the rewards card, even after letting them know that I was from out of state.",

The server came by quickly and asked us what we wanted to drink and what our dinner order would be, which, of course we didn't know because we had just sat down.  We ordered a bottle of wine because a single glass was $18, and he spilled it on the table with each glass he poured, not sure why as the bottle was fine when I poured.  We ordered then and that was the last time we saw him until he asked if we wanted dessert. I requested bread from another server passing by because none was brought or offered by our server.  I got the bourbon glazed salmon and it was fine as long as I scraped off the offensively salty glaze.  The mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach that were the sides were good, they offset the saltiness. My friend got the burger and it was pretty good, she said.   The salmon was not worth the $30 price tag, I have had salmon prepared better at TGI Fridays.  Our server did not meet the bar of fine dining, I have gone to Eddie Merlot and been blown away by the level of service and professionalism.  That was my first time there, so at least I can say I tried it.",

Our food came out quickly and was very well presented. My son ordered the large filet mignon, and devoured it. I had the salmon with a red berry compote and it was delicious.

    "text": "We had dinner last night with another couple at McCormick and Schmick downtown. At 7:30 on Saturday evening, peak time, the restaurant was not full. That's a bad sign. We chose the downtown location because we had a couple of poor service experiences at the south side location. Our experience last night was satisfactory overall. The seafood menu is limited but adequate. Three of us had the fried shrimp and the other a shrimp trilogy, indicating that the fish offerings were unexciting, to say the least. The cocktail and wine choices were decent, with wine prices comparable to other upscale restaurants. Service was a little slow considering the partly empty room. Since they eliminated valet parking it was a little uncomfortable walking several blocks from the garage on a cold, windy night. When McCormick and Schmick opened in Pittsburgh it was one of our favorites, but the thrill is definitely gone. The upscale feel has diminished, the menu has shrunk, service has slipped, and the dining room is a little worn. It's still okay, but not what it used to be. It won't continue as is for much longer. Will it be a makeover or surrender?",

At least 20 minutes late getting seated.  Once seated, the wait-staff tried extremely hard, but the restaurant was so overbooked, the staff could not keep up with drink, appetizer or meal orders.  The wait time was so long, we had to ask the restaurant to serve two in our party before the rest of the group because they had to leave a LITTLE earlier.  Some drink orders were never served and some meals were cold.  Our party would have bought more drinks, deserts etc., but it was taking so long to get served we passed.  Bottom line.  If you are going to dinner on a night when restaurants are typically busy, you might look into other options.",

My boyfriend and I made reservations for late Saturday evening to enjoy a nice dinner in the city. We were seated promptly- but then waited close to 10 minutes for anyone to come to our table, I had to get up and speak to the hostess/manager to find a server to order cocktails. Once we had a server- he was very prompt and quick to help, but the entire experience felt rushed. We ordered appetizers of shrimp cocktail and the lobster bisque- my soup was watered down to say the least and his shrimp cocktail was delicious, but the presentation left much to be desired. Our entrees came not too long after -  I ordered the sesame salmon and my boyfriend the surf & turf. My salmon was okay  (quite over cooked) but my mushroom risotto and Brussel sprouts were great ! My boyfriend enjoyed the lobster tail but it was almost comical how small it was. His steak was also a little over cooked but he enjoyed it and finished it. We decided we didn't want to do dessert after just not being that impressed with anything. I will say - for the price, I expected more. A more complete dining experience ! We both left feeling disappointed.",

As in, you couldn't even go to McDonald's and get a burger and fries at this size for what they're charging.  Now, of course when you go and add in a drink, that's more, but even those are fairly reasonable selection for Happy Hour prices.  However, do note that the beers are fairly limited for  HH.  Only a couple of domestics and 2 or 3 imports; the rest are full price.   The space itself is very classy.  Lots of dark stained wood finish and high ceilings.  Service in the bar area was okay.  I don't know that I would seek it out for a sit down lunch or dinner unless it was for a business meeting (which I suspect is the majority of their clientele because they are right in the heart of the business district), but next time someone wants to go for Happy Hour, I'm in.",

I got seated at a booth by myself and realized that one of the small empty bread plates was still smeared with butter. I picked up the glass to feel sticky grit all over it. Next, I had to check out the silverware but I was afraid to look. They *looked* clean but by this point, I wasn't taking any chances.   It was a full ten minutes before the waitress came by and removed the other settings. That's when I saw all the crumbs under the placemats. Co'mon! Gross! I asked for all new silverware and glasses but the crumbs were never cleared away. I ordered a lunch special and got a bread bowl lobster and corn chowder and a small walnut salad. The salad was spectacular but the soup was fairly flavorless and had a disturbing texture. I did get fresh bread and butter - yay. The waitress did check back with me and asked me how the food was. I said the salad was delish but the soup bowl - super meh. So she brought me an entire bowl of lobster bisque which was some of the best I've ever eaten. That was much appreciated. It took a bit to get my bill and my lunch did take about 20 minutes longer than it should have but it was crowded and a sit-down restaurant.   I will have to really be starving for the soup to brave the dirty dishes again. Which means, in reality, I'll probably be back in two weeks. : ) The bisque is that good. Note: I have eaten at McCormick and Schmick's on the West Coast and this one really needs to be brought up to snuff IMHO. Too bad it's such a mixed bag. There are hardly any decent mid to high range restaurants downtown. But this is about par for course in Pittsburgh. Supposedly a \"foodie\" town but actually, super meh.",

We brought it to the attention of our server and she asked if we wanted to talk to the manager. We said no since we thought she would have taken care of the issue. So we talked to the person who appeared to be a supervisor but he did not do anything except telling us that it won't happen again. So I spoke with the general manager. He apologized and took both of our dinners off the tab that we already paid. That's what service is all about- it precedes the food. That's why we keep going back to places like Eddie Merlots and Morton's where service reigns supreme. Kudos to Dan the general manager for doing the right thing. Food is always secondary to service.",

    "text": "This was our first stop for January 2018 Restaurant week.  Honestly - it has been my worst stop in many years of eating out (for restaurant week and not).    We had lunch time reservations (12:30p).  We had to inquire - twice to get restaurant week menus. Two of us got restaurant week 2 of us did not.  My starter was Maryland Crab soup - described as a crab vegetable soup.  This should just be described as a hearty vegetable soup.  There was no crab.  Crab shouldn't even be in the name.  The spinach salad is incredibly over-dressed.  Once our entree's came we knew this was just going to be a not so hot meal.  All of our food was cold.  I'd requested my salmon rare - it was med-well.  Mashed potatoes - cold.  One of the ladies got a salad - which should be cold - but have you ever experienced when you have cut up tomatoes and then they sit for a couple days so they are a pile of mush.  Yeah - it was gross.    Our waiter was not good.  He interjected into our conversations when he happened to come to the table while we were in conversation.  He blamed a mix up on our bills on a trainee.  He spoke to us like we were country bumpkin coming into the \"big city\" for lunch.    All around this meal was not good.  The service, the food, everything.  If you are going out for restaurant week - don't waste your time here.   Buyer beware.",

Yesterday I have to say; the drinks were on point but the service food and level of professionalism was a total ZERO.    The food came out to customers really quickly.  Which is usually a good sign.  Mine order too came out quickly but was ice cold.  I was never asked how my food was the entire 90 Minutes I was there.  That being said, the number of workers minimum of 4 and up to 8 that stood around the end of the bar near the restroom with nothing to do told me a clear story that customer service was not a priority but rather an endless discussion of their Halloween costumes and how they planned to get wasted.  Unprofessional for this caliber of restaurant.    From the time they took my plate, the signal I am was done, until they acknowledged I needed My check was more than 30 minutes.  I still left an 18% tip when less than 10 was deserving; but there was so few in the bar I just wanted out.    Clearly the management and leadership has left the restaurant over the last year.  It's a shame; it used to be a great professional happy hour in the downtown after work.",

We were promptly seated without a reservation and, telling our server we had allotted an hour before our theater excursion, we had ample time to order and enjoy our dinner.  I ordered the seared scallops and my husband ordered the shrimp scampi. We did without any other accompaniments as the prices were a la carte and pricey.  We were both happy with our meals and the plating was very nice.  My scallops did come with some cooked spinach and a potato hash which were sufficient and I didn't feel I needed another side.  Our server was efficient and kept us on time for our show so I am most thankful for the experience.  The four starts vs. five stars is about price.  Very steep in price for the experience as with most places offering a-la-carte dining.",

    "text": "We were a party of six with a 5:45 reservation for dinner before Hamilton on Saturday evening. When we arrived (on time) the restaurant was busy, but there were still empty tables. We were advised to order everything at once and quickly, because the restaurant was full. It took a little time for the server to return for our order, but we did order then.  Being a spice wimp, I asked if the Maryland style crab chowder was spicy. Our server said it was not. However, mine was too spicy for me; I couldn't eat it. It wasn't too spicy for our friend who ordered it, but she forgot to bring his, so he had to wait.... We were supposed to be at the theater at about 7:15. At 6:45 we still didn't have our entrees. (They were out of my first choice, the wahoo, so I had the glazed salmon.) At 6:50 we were told our food would be ready in 6-8 minutes.  My spouse had the mis-named stuffed salmon. (The \"stuffing\" sat on top of the fish.) He would have liked it better if it was hot. He thought it was okay.  My daughter likes green beans. The ones that came with her fish were too salty and oily to eat. She thought the rest of her meal was okay.  My entree was also only average: a relatively small (but large enough for me) piece of glazed salmon and a bunch of warm, wilted spinach. What you might expect at TGI Friday's or from your local freezer case. (We were never asked how well-done we liked our fish cooked, and what we received was medium-well to well done.) This restaurant has and can do better.  We didn't have time to tarry over dinner or have dessert or coffee (which we might have had, as we were also celebrating our daughter's birthday), so that we could finish at about 7:30.  Slow service. Unimpressive food. This is not what we've come to expect from this restaurant. Perhaps they were understaffed in the kitchen, as well as on the floor. Whatever the problem (and our dinners had many), I hope they fix it soon.  I hope my next review of this restaurant reflects a better experience.",

    "text": "This review is for their bar/happy hour only. I came here recently with a friend for their happy hour, as they have really cheap food and drink specials (and ordinarily it's rather expensive to eat here). We got there shortly after 4:30 (when happy hour begins) and snagged one of the last tables....it quickly became standing-room only shortly thereafter. There was only one or maybe two servers taking care of the entire bar area, which was unfortunate given how crowded it was. Our poor waitress was very nice and apologetic, but it was just impossible for her to provide good service given how many tables she had to deal with. So the service was pretty abysmal...it took us a good 20 minutes to get our drinks. When she finally came back with our drinks, we ordered food from their happy hour menu...a burger for my friend and hummus and a chicken quesadilla for me. After about 20 minutes after placing our order, our waitress came back and said they didn't have hummus (bummer, but okay). Then...no exaggeration...we waited another HOUR for our food. We weren't in a hurry and had planned on staying awhile, so in the grand scheme of things, this wasn't a big deal. But I have no idea why it took an hour and 20 minutes to get our food. And when we did get our food? It was pretty terrible. I am usually a more forgiving critic when it comes to happy hour eats (I mean, I'm getting an appetizer for $5, so I try not to be too picky!), but this food was just not good at all. My quesadilla was cold, so the cheese was congealed on the inside. It was supposed to be a chicken quesadilla, but the meat was sparse and tasted cheap and low-quality. It came with a pico that was strangely dry. Also very strangely, the sour cream drizzled on top of the quesadilla was dry (I didn't even think that was possible....how can sour cream taste dry? But somehow it did). Honestly, it was probably the worst quesadilla I've ever eaten. My friend's burger meal wasn't any better...it was sloppily plated, cooked to a burnt texture, and her fries were cold. We both ended up giving up on our food after a few bites.  I know that M&S has a reputation for being a high-end restaurant, so I'm not sure why they would serve such cheap, low-quality food during their happy hour. Either way, between the poor service and the disappointing food, I don't think I'll be back here for happy hour any time soon.",

But, maybe because it's a chain, I have always thought it was just \"meh\" for the most part. Some place pretty good and quick, but nothing to write home about.  In any event, came with my wife here for January 2018 restaurant week. The dinner was mostly just okay. You could sort of tell how they tried to cut corners on the restaurant week menu (which is a tad irritating because the deal is the only reason anyone was there for dinner).  For example, the crab soup was just a vegetable soup with a little crab thrown in there. The lobster sauce on the mashed potatoes was just their bisque soup base. My wife's steak medallions had to be sent back for very obviously being undercooked-- something that reflects inattentiveness and lack of attention to detail.  That said, much of the food was still good, like the lobster tails, potato hash, calamari. The desserts were decadent, as well. Mostly stuff you can't mess up. Service was good.  So, in the end, it was a pretty good but not a place I would be itching to go to, and I would probably Never come back here during restaurant week Again.",

    "text": "I came here during their Happy Hour and I'm glad I did! Their Lemon Drop Martini ($7) happy hour special was absolutely delicious. I also got their calamari which came with jalapeno aioli sauce, and marinara sauce. For $5.99, their fried calamari was exceptional. The breading on the calamari is pretty light and frail, which I liked. They didn't taste unhealthily heavy and oily.   I haven't come during their regular hours yet, which I have yet to do so. Their happy hour doesn't get too busy until about 5:45pm. So if you're getting off work in downtown and need a quick drink, definitely stop  by here!",

The same girl doing tables!? - weird). Then it took a long time just to get our drinks - wine and champagne for two. Bread came a long time after we were done with appetizers.   My husband's dish came without a black bean puree and some tiny underwhelming side roasted vegetables to feed a toddler. My food (salmon with peas/asparagus) tasted really good. My son's fish and chips were more like fish strips, he joked about not being able to tell the fish apart from the fries. My daughter's kids popcorn shrimp was a nice portion for a kids menu. We also had the fruit chocolate box, with raspberries and blueberries... no strawberry and very little fruit (only a few berries on the top. The mousse tasyef good and the chocolate was rich but the box itself was not that elegant, uneven sides.   I will not come back here... there are so many restaurants in the area, equally overpriced (my mini champagne bottle was $20) but at least the food is consistent and service is much better.",

It was my first time eating here and I really liked the atmosphere it provided for lunch.  On top of that our service was fast and friendly.  For my meal I went with the American Kobe Style Burger.  The burger itself was cooked perfectly.  The meat was very tender and fresh.  The only issue with the burger was the way it was built.  The lettuce and tomatoes were placed underneath the patty which did not provide a solid base for the meat.  Because of this, the burger slid around and off of the bun several times.  This caused everything to become a little sloppy and required me to reconstruct the burger.  Despite this, it was still an incredible burger.  I had fries as my side with their homemade ranch which were also very good.    I would definitely stop back here to have another burger or to try some of their other options.",

    "text": "We decided to come here for happy hour before a show. They have a fairly long happy hour (4:30-7) and from what I saw online, it was a decent menu. We walked in around 4:50 and got to seats right in the center of the bar. Despite being in the center, with no drinks/ food in front of us, trying to grab the attention of the bartenders, we weren't able to even put in an order for at least 15 minutes. My boyfriend managed to wave one down after she checked on the man sitting next to us (for the second time since we had arrived). That was annoying.  I ordered a glass of their house cab and he got whiskey ginger. The price of the glass was probably the same as what you would get at cheaper restaurants. They also had featured cocktails on the menu. I later tried the proscecco sangria, but was not a big fan... too much ice and fruit, very little actual liquid in there. I'm glad I mostly had wine.   We also ordered a couple small plates to share. We were starving by the time we arrived, so we ordered the Jumbo shrimp cocktail, calamari, and truffle fries. Once we finally ordered, it wasn't long before our food came out. They accidentally brought us hummus instead of fries, but that was quickly replaced once we told our bartender the mistake. We ended up ordering the hummus later because it looked sooo good.  The shrimp was more expensive on the menu ($9) and came four pieces. I was a little surprised that it wasn't a half dozen, but regardless it was still really good. The calamari was my favorite. I love fried calamari. They gave us a jalapeno aioli to dip it in, and that was AWESOME. Great pairing. The fries were fine, but they were french fries, so it's not like the bar was set pretty high. Hummus was really good- if you're thinking of getting something like that, definitely get the hummus.   Our opinion of the bar ended up being redeemed once it got a little later and we ended up chatting with the bartender. I don't think I would've noticed how long it took to be greeted if I hadn't been so hungry and eager to place our food order. Everything else came at a fair pace, drinks refilled whenever empty, etc.  I think next time I'll be a little more strategic in what we order, and also prepared to wait a while.",

She offered us some bread while we looked at the menu.  To drink, I had a Arnold Palmer, which was not too sweet and delicious. To eat, I selected the Ultimate Mixed Grill...it came with red pepper mashed potatoes & green beans.  The food came out quickly but the mashed potatoes were a bit cold.  Everything else was a good temperature and the flavors were great.  My favorite was the lump crab cake and grilled shrimp.  Both were seasoned well, but the sauce for the crab cake really set it off.  The stuffed shrimp were ok, but I feel like they relied on the stuffing for flavor because the shrimp were plain and lacked flavor.  I'm not a fan of those.  Overall, it was a very good dish, and I would get it again (minus the stuffed shrimp).  The server was friendly and I would definitely return to this location.",

So we ordered a doz and as soon  as they arrived I could smell something was wrong. On my second sniff I find the bad one and sent it back and they replaced it.   No problem the rest were fine.   But when getting some cocktail sauce from the cup we found remnants of a fried shrimp tail.  REALLY??  The manager came over and apologized profusely but really??  At a classy place you think they'd either comp the oysters or at least discount them. But not here.  It's almost a FU too bad.   So disappointed.   I should have known- it's a chain restaurant and it's all about volume not quality.  I used to think better of this place.   Really the smell of the bad oyster should have set off alarms 3 doors down.  And what manager wouldn't try to make up somehow for re-using condiments from previous table.",

We never received lemon for our water as requested. She never refilled our water or wine glasses. The manager never visited our table.

    "text": "I went to McCormick & Schmick's a while back when I saw them listed as a restaurant week option. I started with the soup which was good but it was just an average cup of soup. Nothing that blew me away. My boyfriend ended up getting the fried calamari and I was pleasantly surprised. It was a very large starter and it wasn't your traditional fried calamari. It had a variety of different things mixed in with the calamari. Obviously they were all fried so I wasn't able to make out what they all were but it was good none the less. I also really enjoyed that it was served with more of a sweet sauce. It wasn't served with marinara.  Entree wise both of us decided to go with the stuffed salmon. It looked really good on the menu and the waitress said it was her favorite dish but I sadly wasn't impressed. In my personal opinion I just didn't enjoy the Brie flavor mixed with the salmon. I love both separately but I wasn't loving them paired together. The mashed potatoes and green beans in the side were delicious however!  For our deserts we picked 1 cheesecake and 1 silk cake. As soon as I saw the \"silk\" cake coming out I thought things didn't look right with the cake. The waitress proceeded to set the plate down and the cake completely toppled over and the waitress thought nothing of it. I'm not sure what exactly we were served but it wasn't edible. You could barely get your spoon/fork to break a piece off. It was as if the cake had been frozen and then served as is. It was really disappointing and pretty shocking that no one else noticed anything wrong with it. We even took it home hoping it would thaw out but 48 hours later it was still hard as a rock.",

    "text": "Went for dinner before a show.  It was very good.  I ordered the Hawaiian Big Eye Ahi Tuna.  It was seared tuna, sliced thin on top of mashed potatoes and a side of baby bok choy.  I really liked it, the ahi was good quality (it had to be given that it was served very rare).  The only thing I wasn't wild about was the table side ahi tartare.  As the name suggests, the server prepares this at your table by mixing your choice of egg, caper, dijon, etc with ahi tuna and serving it with some pita chips as a spread.  We asked for everything to be mixed in with the ahi.  The problem was the server had way too much dijon in her bowl and the taste overpowered everything else.  We told her about it and she seemed a little surprised and said she would make note of it.  Maybe she was new or they don't make that dish very often.  Whatever the case be careful if you order it or the dijon can just take over.  Cocktails at M&S are always good, although a bit pricey.  They always use fresh fruit/juice when mixing their drinks and you can definitely tell the difference.  Service was good and timed everything so we had plenty of time to make the start of the show.  Overall, I always enjoy M&S.  Good place to go before a show or a special occasion.  With all the places popping up that are more concerned about the hip factor, it's nice to go to a place like M&S where service & quality are still the name of the game.",

    "text": "To summarize what I'm about to say - the food was okay, but way overpriced, and the service was pretty sub-par.   Getting into more details - I gave us nearly 2 hours to eat before seeing a show 2 minutes away at the Benedum, and we were still almost late.  We had a reservation and were seated quickly, but sat there for about 5 minutes before our server introduced herself, set down 2 empty water glasses and said she'd be our server for the night and would be back soon.  We then waited another 5 minutes before a manager came by and asked if we'd been helped and since we hadn't been, he took our drink orders and got us our water.  We waited nearly another 5 minutes before our serve came back to take our orders - all-in-all, we waited about 15 minutes to place our order.  We ordered the sea scallop appetizer ($15 for 4 scallops - nearly $4/scallop).  This came out very fast and was tasty, which gave me hope for the future of our meal.   For our meal, I ordered the fried shrimp, and my husband ordered the bourbon glazed salmon.  Both of these items were cooked well and had good flavor, but there was nothing special about them, that made them worth the price of the items.   About partway through our meal, we finished our waters and our drinks and had yet to see our waitress again.  She did eventually come by and notice that we were \"looking thirsty\" and probably wanted more water.  She didn't ask us if we wanted another drink though - luckily, we didn't.   Then, we were silly enough to think that 30 minutes was plenty of time to get dessert and pay the check before our show.  This was not the case.  My husband ordered the apple pie, and  I got the chocolate silk pie.  The apple pie was very good, if not a bit too sweet where the candied walnuts were concerned.  My chocolate pie was so rich, that I could only eat a few bites before being totally overwhelmed by the flavor to continue.    We had asked for our check with our dessert, so we would be able to quickly pay and leave.  The check sat on the edge of our table waiting to be taken by our waitress for the entire time we ate our desserts.  Once she took it, it still took almost 10 minutes to get it back to sign.   As an aside, the decor was dark and drab and seemed dated.  Nothing terribly pleasant, and I even noticed a light fixture by the enterance that looked like a bunch of boobs with nipples.     Overall, I would NOT recommend this restaurant to friends and family, or even strangers.  There are plenty of other places you can spend $100 on a meal at in Pittsburgh that will be much more worth your money.  And honestly, if you want seafood - Red Lobster is just as good.",

    "text": "I have had two meals in the dining room and a handful (or two) of happy hours here.   Dining room is nice but a bit stuffy. Yes, I get that you are trying to appeal to the upper crust, but it's so darn dark! The first meal there was with a larger work group and service was good but not great. Food was delicious but I definitely had my water go dry for a while quite a few times. A water pitcher at the table would have saved a few steps and gotten a higher review from me.   My second meal was the worst of the two. The server was overwhelmed as she was the only one in her section and had a peach of a customer at the table adjacent to mine. I was there with a friend for a quick lunch and we let the server know this. She tried her damnedest to accommodate but the squeaky wheel gets the grease and this guy behind us was complaining about every item he could. We ordered our food (my friend got a salad and I got a bowl of the lobster bisque). It took roughly 40 minutes during the lunch rush to get the food, and we were one of 4 tables in that section. During our wait, we got about one refill of our drinks and some rolls to satiate us during the long wait. The entertainment during our water and rolls was the peach of a customer complaining so well that he not only got the manager to come out but also the head chef. The manager then said \"we're going to comp this meal and then give you a certificate to come back to a meal on us\". The complainer pushed the envelope saying \"will that include alcohol?\". Pssh. I dislike customers who only want something for free, and especially those managers who cater to that type of customer at the suffering of other guests. The food that time was just as good as the last time but I wish we had more time to enjoy it!  McCormick & Schmick's is known to have the best happy hours in town, and I will say that their prices are pretty good. You can get bruschetta or amazing humus and pita chips for $3 from 4:30 to 7PM. How awesome is that?! There's also a bunch of other apps at varying prices, going up to $9 per item. Have a few apps and you have dinner on the cheap! They also have $4.50 dirty vodka martinis and Manhattans, the drinks of choice of my husband and I. There are tons of other specials on liquors and beers but it is a limited selection of special drinks and you're looking at well liquor for most.   I do have a few things to avoid at happy hour: - Cheeseburger: At $5, it seems like a steal. But the patty is obviously straight from a freezer box (those scalloped edges give it away) and is flavorless. Waste of money when McD's is right down the block. - Shots: Not only do they not know how to make many shots, but they charge a ridiculous price for them - close to double the cost of one of the drinks. I was even told \"we don't really serve shots a lot so I don't know how to make many\". Ehhh...bad bartender.  - Night before a holiday: It is a madhouse and service is horrible! It is like they made the schedule completely oblivious to upcoming holidays.   Odds are that I will be back here as it's right across the street from my office and coworkers enjoy going there for a quick one after work. I think I'll just continue to stick with the happy hour apps, my $4.50 dirty vodka martinis, and water. It's cheaper, quicker, and not as stressful as the dining room.",

I was told potatoes and was not offered a salad appetizer or even a glass of wine. the bartender just stood watching football and occasionally complained of being tired to the waitress.I did notice a manager? , but football was more important than the one guest that was sitting at the bar.I was not acknowledged.The food was fine but it would have been nice to have a cup of soup to start, a glass of wine maybe.I was the only person in the bar area you would think they would try to capitalize on every sale they could.",

    "text": "While I do expect more from a place like this that generally has a good reputation, my expectations are still reasonable. Unfortunately, this restaurant did not meet any of of them. (I must note that it was quite crowded for lunch, with many downtowners celebrating the Holidays with coworkers.) We had a reservation, so we were sat immediately - sadly, that was the highlight of our experience. It was extremely loud with so many people AND there was loud music in the background, too. We had a very difficult time hearing each other, which means that we had a very difficult time hearing our server. I don't understand why, after *several times* telling him that we couldn't hear him, he wouldn't raise his voice. It was frustrating, so we all just kind of smiled and nodded when he came by. He was clearly new and seemed nervous, but he made some pretty glaring mistakes. #1 The 3 tables around us that were seated after us got their drinks and table bread first. And when we DID get our bread, he forgot the butter. Then he disappeared for a long time and didn't reappear until he brought the apps. By the time he got the butter, we were over the bread and into the apps. We got the Mushroom Flatbread and it was bland. The only \"flavor\" came from the sparse sprinking of mushrooms. It needed seasoned badly, or some herbs, or something! We also got the fried calimari, which was OK. They weren't crispy and there were other fried things mixed in with it, which I thought was odd. And for a huge plate, they only gave us like 1 tablesoon of sauce. It wasn't worth saying anything because it probably would have taken forever to get more! Next he brought out salads. I got the walnut & greens salad, but when it arrived, it was missing the blue cheese. When I asked the server if it's supposed to have blue cheese, he answered by telling me that he could go get some for me. I wanted to know if it was supposed to come with it because if not, I wasn't going to request it. Again, though, I had a difficult time hearing him. My entree was not good. I was so excited about it, too! I got the Coast to Coast Tuna - \"west coast\" was tuna tartar with a hunk of avocado and 3 drops of something orange with no flavor. The \"east coast\" was seared tuna with some kind of soy/sweet sauce/glaze. The west coast tuna frankly sucked. I didn't \"get\" the avocado and the texture was way too similar to the tuna, so everything just kind of smooshed around in your mouth. There was no flavor at all. Plus, I had to spit out a bite I took because it had a \"tough\" piece that felt like what it feels like when you're eating chicken and you get a piece of that white tendon. I did not eat the last (and biggest) piece because I could see the white tough flesh and knew that I'd end up spitting that out, too. The \"east coast\" wasn't horrible, but there were some issues: Instead of letting the flavor of the sear and sauce speak, each piece was topped with a thin sliver of jalepeno (I think?), a tiny parsley leaf, and then a tiny drop of something red. I didn't get it. Those little extras didn't add anything, so I just removed them before eating. The sauce was yummy, though. In the middle of the plate was what looked like some kind of flat fried bread. It was just bare...sitting in the middle of the plate like it wasn't \"complete.\" Nothing about the dish made sense.  Overall, this was a bad experience. I'm glad I didn't pay for it!",

I wanted a real Pittsburgh place.  We get to the restaurant just before our reservation and are seated in moments.  The hostess was very nice.  The waitress came along in a very timely manner and was also as nice as can be.  Everything got off to a great start.  I ordered the Steelhead (It's Alaskan, but sounded Pittsburgh), a bowl of New England Chowder and a beer.  The chowder was delicious.  Creamy, meaty and oh so good.  The steelhead was absolutely wonderful.  Tender, moist, delicious.  It came with spinach that was also very good, not overdone or over buttered.  We found we were very full and didn't go for dessert, although I did take an Irish coffee.  Very good in place of a dessert.  Don't skip this place if you are in the area.",

    "text": "I ate here the other night for dinner with a dining companion.  I had been here before numerous times for both lunches and happy hours but have never actually been for dinner.  Since I arrived a bit earlier than my dining companion I started out the evening in the bar.  It was during happy hour and so incredibly busy.  If you have never been there before for happy hour it is worth noting that they have one of the better ones around.  When you buy a drink, you can also order a number of different appetizers/bar food for under $6 and including a $4 cheeseburger and $3 hummus.  For dinner my dining companion and I decided to start off our meals by splitting the calamari.  It was cooked perfectly with the breading being crispy and the squid not overly chewy which paired perfectly with both the lemon aioli and spicy marinara.  Even though my companion does not normally eat squid, she and I both quickly polished off this dish.  Next up was a bowl of clam chowder.  The actual size of the bowl was surprisingly large and the creaminess of the soup was sublime.  I especially enjoyed dipping the sourdough bread that was brought out prior to our meal into it to put a touch of tartness with the savory creaminess.  Overall I was really impressed with both of my starters and was enjoying myself.  After our appetizers were finished our entrees came out.  I had ordered the fish and chips which was served with cole slaw, ketchup and a cocktail sauce on the side.  The fish came out at a perfect temperature, hot enough to make it pleasurable but not hot enough to burn your mouth.  Sadly the lack of taste for a beer battered fish was disappointing and I ended up asking the waitress for a malt vinegar.  I preceded to use on not only the fish and but the fries as well which were sans the Chesapeake seasoning (Old Bay) promised by the menu.  The cole slaw also seemed to lack any distinguishing flavor and I ended up leaving it on my plate barely touched.  The whole entree was quite a disappointment after such a promising start to the meal.  For dessert, my dining companion and I decided to split the creme brulee.  It came with the normal caramelized sugar and also a few assorted berries on top.  It wasn't anything spectacular or different than your average creme brulee but I enjoyed it all the same as creme brulee happens to be my favorite dessert.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I was impressed by both the appetizers and dessert here and would be happy if they could only get the taste of the entree up to par.",

Perfect for a family game of \"guess what it is before you bite into it\" (bok choy turned out to be artichoke, carrot was sweet potato) - My scallops were divine, perfectly cooked with a rich butter sauce and unusual, tasty potato hash. - My mom was tickled by the size of her flounder dish (\"I have TWO fillets!\") and the butternut squash orzo that accompanied it just melted in your mouth.   - My eighteen year old brother announced he would try fish and chips for the first time, and is now worried that the dense Yuengling batter and tasty, flaky fish has ruined him for \"regular\" f&c.   - Seared tuna and stuffed shrimp, also lovely.

    "text": "I made dinner reservations for this past Saturday to be assured a table as most other places I checked out were already booked for a pre-show dinner. I have also had this place recommended to me by friends and co-workers. When I arrived after my husband, the entrance staff were very cordial and welcoming. They took me back to the table quickly. One problem is that the inside was very dark. I know they were trying for intimate, but with the dark walls and dark carpeting, it was more cave-like than intimate. I had a hard time trying not to bump into anything on the way back to the table. When I got there, there was only a small candle in the center of the table for illumination. Our waiter, Harley, was nice enough, but he was heavy on the upsell of everything. It wasn't overly busy as there were empty tables when we got there, but it took a while for my drink from the bar to arrive. I kept getting assured that it was coming. When he brought it over, we placed our dinner order. My husband ordered the Maryland Crab Soup as a starter with the promises of something similar to the she-crab soup from the part of Virginia where he grew up. What he got tasted like Campbell's vegetable soup with crab put in just before serving. I could even smell the familiar scent of the veggie soup. The shrimp cocktail had exactly 6 shrimp for like $15 dollars. The number was not on the menu, so it was not worth the charge.   As our entrees, I ordered the 6oz filet mignon with a side of Gruyere and bacon mashed potato. I was not told that the filet had come with a side of broccoli or I might not have ordered the mash. The broccoli was not quite steamed enough as the middle of the stems were still quite hard. There is crunchy and then there is uncooked. The filet was seasoned pretty well and was cooked to order. My husband ordered the Yuengling fish and chips. The \"chips\" in this case were on the menu as Chesapeake fries. The anticipation was Old Bay seasoning on the fries, at least. We think the seasoning was Penzey's Seafood seasoning, which was okay, but not enough to be called Chesapeake. The fish was simple cod in a beer batter. Not really worth the $19 sticker price.  There was a gentleman in a suit traversing the room asking this table and that how things were going. He passed by our table three or four times and never once spoke to us.  One good thing was that they got us out of there in time to get to the theater for our show. Although others may have had a nice experience here, we really did not and will not recommend this restaurant to our out-of-town friends.",

    "text": "Happy Thanksgiving Yelp Nation!   As a transplant from a small town roughly 200 miles west of the 'Burgh it is a treat when I get to see my family. This year, due to work I had the actual holiday off, but no time for travel. My wonderful family decided to make the 4 hour drive in the snow and holiday traffic to come see their beloved baby boy. As a dedicated bachelor my apartment is suited to making spaghetti and meat balls and maybe a salad. Since this is no suitable Thanksgiving meal, we decided to book a table at McCormick & Schmick's. Truly this was a great decision.  To start with the decor, as usual (creature of habit), one automatically knows what one is in for. The place is full of lots of wood paneling, art-deco light fixtures, white tablecloths, and every other cliched trapping of a post industrialist restaurant. It conjured images of Ruth's Chris, Morton's or Capital Grill. Expensive and pretentious. However I am secretly 73 years old at heart so I kind of like it. At least it is consistent.  The service, which can at times mirror the decor in the high end steakhouse world, was actually quite pleasant. Our waiter, Peter, was very friendly and pleasant without being overbearing. This is a stark contrast to the last time I ate in a restaurant in the same style. Unlike that trip to the Capital Grill, which was me and my family suffering through some of the most condescending service I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing, Peter was warm and inviting and treated us like family. When I open my own restaurant I am cloning him about 20 times and calling it a day.  The main reason anyone goes to M&S, and any restaurant really,  is the food. I had a very memorable Thanksgiving dinner. Everything was amazing. We started with the Shrimp Kisses and the Coast to Coast Tuna. Both were wow dishes for me. The shrimp were lightly fried, stuffed with a pepperjack cheese (which was not overly spicy so big plus there) and wrapped with bacon, because bacon. The Tuna definitely had an Asian flavor profile and was comprised of very good seared tuna and a tuna tartar.  I followed the appetizers with an Iceberg Wedge Salad and some oysters. The salad was good, but nothing unique; think the same obligatory wedge salad you find in every steakhouse in America. The oysters were fantastic as well; fresh succulent and just the perfect bite of the ocean.  For dinner I had a grilled swordfish with asparagus, a butternut squash cous cous and a citrus salad on top. I cant even begin to put into words how awesome this dish was, so I'm not going to even try. Just take my lack of word for it.  For dessert, I ended with a chocolate and mocha cheesecake that was a special offering for the day. It was amazing. It was rich and sweet and had just the right balance of crunch in the Oreo crust. The thing I liked the best about it though was the dusting of cinnamon and coco powder put on the plate, obviously as a garnish. However, I had the bright idea to put the garnish on the cake and it gave it a pleasant spicy kick that set the dessert over the top.  To wrap up I like McCormick & Schmick's. Expect to pay top dollar (our bill was pushing $250 and we weren't drinking either) but I feel it was well worth it. The food was amazing, the decor, while a little stuffy, was exactly what I expected, but the star was the service. It is so easy to get caught up in yourself working for a high end restaurant, however our particular server, Peter was absolutely fantastic. I would go back just for him. And the cheesecake. And swordfish. And i need to stop myself before this gets even gushier.",

We asked for the manager and he acted like he didn't know what to do! We rarely complain but this time was necessary. He offered to take our food back and \"warm it up\" but at this point we were starving and wanted out of there. He finally took 2 of 6 entrees off the bill and gave us free entree coupons (which we won't come back to use.) I've been to the other location (Southside) before - although it was years ago - and was never this disappointed. Avoid this place unless you have hours to spare (God-forbid tickets to a show after) and enjoy mediocre, small portioned, cold food.",

My family and I (about 25 people) had a private room to celebrate my grandmother's 85th birthday. It was a very special occasion; family members flew in just for the weekend, so of course I was expecting nothing but the best from this establishment. The waiters took our drink and appetizer orders and they came out promptly. After taking our food orders, we waited over an hour and a half to get our meals. The food was not hot at all; it was lukewarm at best. Some people's meals that came with mashed potatoes were told the kitchen ran out of mashed potatoes --- when the food came out. And instead of asking what they would like in place of the mashed potatoes, they just put roasted potatoes on the plate and served it. Then I asked the waiter to bring out the cake. He brought the cake out, put the candles in the cake, and set it on the table and walked back in the kitchen without lighting the candles or anything. The manager ended up having to take $300 off of the bill because half of the family did not even eat their food. This was not the level of service or quality of food I was expecting from this restaurant. I was, and still am, deeply disappointed that what was supposed to be a joyous occasion turned out so awful. I will never dine here again and will be calling corporate.",

We had lobster bites a the appetizer, lightly breaded with 2 dipping sauces served in a lobster shell - very tasty.  Our son had the lobster bisque soup which was amazing.  Hot sourdough bread fresh out of the oven served with our salads which were a generous portion and very flavorful with a light vinaigrette house dressing.  Main courses were fabulous with a generous portion.  Creme Brule with fresh fruit as a free birthday dessert.  I was worried the price wouldn't be worth the amount of food but I was wrong.  Very much worth every cent.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I really like my food hot and it was lukewarm.",

We had to wait over 45 minutes to have our food brought to us, as we watched every table who were seated after us get their food. When the waiter realized we hadn't gotten our food, he said \"they're re-making it now, it should be out in 5 minutes\" as someone forgot the food! Once the food did arrive it was very subpar and not worth the money. Maybe it's because it's a chain restaurant. The manager (who was walking around all evening) asked how our night has been and when we expressed our concerns, he said \"ok thanks for the input\" and walked away. When you are spending $25+ on a meal, you expect it to be a great experience. Overall poor experience.",

Last Saturday night I took my elderly mother into the city to see the Creche and we made reservations to then have dinner at this location of McCormick & Schmick's. Between the number of patrons wearing greasy baseball caps as they dined and a manager walking around with his shirttail out, the atmosphere felt more like that of a coffee shop than a quality restaurant. Service was generally polite but uninformed. The clam chowder had a slight wall paper paste quality to it but to be fair they certainly did not scrimp on clams. My crab cake entree was soggy to the point of rendering them completely tasteless. I'm guessing they either had been previously frozen or refrigerated for a lengthy period of time. Regardless, they were a real disappointment and not close to being worth the $34 price tag. Doubtful that we'll ever return but that may be a moot point as it wouldn't surprise me to see this place on corporate's chopping block.  As to the baseball caps, Tony Soprano would not have been pleased. ;-)",

Getting a reservation for a snowy, Friday night was easy-peasy and they sat us even though we were 10 minutes late.   The drinks were fantastic. I had a Lemon Drop, and like the M&S in Kansas City, it was the best Lemon Drop I've had. We also ordered a raw tuna appetizer that was just delicious. Unfortunately, that's almost where the glowing review ends.  I just want to say that the service was very good. Our server was attentive and kept our order rolling to ensure that we were on time for our curtain.  I had the seared scallops with sauteed spinach and red pepper white cheddar mash and my husband had the sirloin with broccoli and ordered a side of oven-roasted mushrooms.  The mash in my meal was cold, not ice cold but not even lukewarm and the potato chunks were under cooked. My husband's mushrooms were cold, actually cold and his broccoli crown (whole, not cut up) was literally raw. They hadn't even cut off the end of the stalk that starts to turn brown when it's getting old.  We both chose 1 glass of wine each and the wine-by-the-glass menu is not extensive. Neither of our choices were great. Luckily, the manager comped our wines since most of our food was cold.  For a higher priced restaurant such as McCormick & Schmick's I do not expect and will not accept such poorly prepared food not once, twice, but especially not three times in one meal. We will NOT be returning.",

    "text": "My husband and I started at the bar for drinks then decided to have dinner in the restaurant on a Friday night.  Big mistake.  The disappointment started when I noticed that, having only 1/4 of his beer left, my husband had something big floating in it.  I still have no idea what it was.  Not wanting to make an issue out of it, he simply ordered another one.  Little did we know it was the beginning of a bad evening.  I started my dinner with a salad and ordered blue cheese dressing.  Not only was the blue cheese on the salad tasteless, the dressing had absolutely NO taste.  None.  I have never had tasteless blue cheese before.  My husband ordered clam chowder, which he said was okay.  I ordered the Shrimp Trilogy ($28).  The fried shrimp were FAR overdone and were extremely tough.  The stuffed shrimp was not loaded with lump crab meat as the menu said, but rather a ball of bland stuffing.  The worst part was the shrimp scampi -- the sauce was HORRIBLE!  It was very sour and bitter, like it had vinegar or lime as an ingredient (I could not tell).  It was absolutely terrible!  I tried to eat the shrimp after rubbing the sauce off.  It was inedible.  The side of sweet potato orzo was good, however.  My husband ordered the buttermilk fried shrimp ($21).  As I mentioned with my meal, the shrimp was so overdone and tough.  They butterflied the shrimp so that it was split all the way to the tail, which only allowed for the shrimp to cook even faster.  I think my husband ate 2 shrimp (if that) and took the rest home.  When he tried to reheat them later, not surprisingly, they became even tougher.  They went in the garbage, as did a good portion of my meal.  I watched an episode of the Billion Dollar Buyer where the owner of the Landry's chain, Tilman Fertitta, said he keeps his food costs down to 25% or lower.  It shows!  We left around 6:00 pm on a Friday night, and there were only 2 other tables occupied in the restaurant.  Now I know why.  Not what I would have expected from a higher end restaurant.",
