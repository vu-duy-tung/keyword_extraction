The staff are fantastic,  too. A group of 12 family members and I recently went there, and they were incredibly accommodating, despite the demands of a party that size and with such big personalities.",

They have a great beer selection and while I like how each beer on tap is written on chalk boards hanging at the bar, I do wish they had a beer menu at your table. This was very hard to see. I tried the Sarnac Pumpkin and it was just ok.  We didn't venture far on the menu and ordered the specialties that were boxed. The candied bacon for a starter was delicious-unique flavor. I was disappointed with so few pizza choices. We went with the Black and Gold but did not like the beets-I thought the flavor was too overpowering.  I recommend this place for drinks as the bar had really nice seating and a cute yet trendy decor.",

    "text": "I have eaten here multiple times and this may be one of my new favorite restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh! The first time we sat at the pizza bar which is a Great place to sit and watch your pizza being made in the wood fire oven! A show must have let out shortly after we arrived because there was a rush of people at the door suddenly and they were telling people it'd be a 45 minute wait! We split the carnivore pizza which was absolutely delicious! Bacon, pepperoni, and sausage- the dough was delicious as well!They have a great craft beer selection, the wine prices seemed to high to me, but everything else seemed priced appropriately. I'd also recommend the Bianca pizza or the Forrest if you are looking for a veggie pizza. I've also eaten here for lunch, which was not as satisfying so the \"star ratings\" are really based on my dinner experiences. I ordered the chicken caprese puccia(balsamic-marinated chicken breast / house-cured black pepper bacon / oven-roasted Roma tomato / house-made basil pesto / house mozzarella) The bread completely overwhelmed the sandwich and when I opened it up to see how big the piece of chicken was it was literally half the size of my palm! I'm a very small person so obviously if it's half the size of my palm I don't even think this constitutes as acceptable on a sandwich. The flavors were good but it was disappointing because of the proportion of bread to meat. I will say,however, that the homemade chips were AMAZING and probably honestly the best I have ever had-and I am NOT a chip person at all! My boyfriend had the soup special (chilled pepper with scallops) and the special for lunch (pork and spaetzle with pancetta). he too commented on the size of his entree which looked more like an appetizer but it was tasty. The soup (besides the chips which again were amazing but that's not a reason to return anywhere) was I think the highlight for both of us. I'll still return but I think for dinner instead of lunch",

Awesome selection, equal to or better than Urban Tap. The only place I can think of with better drafts is Caliente. As for the cocktails, I can only say I was disappointed in the Hophatten. Why the cocktail had ice in it after its already watered down with beer is beyond me.  We started with the bacon candy and house chips. Would recommend bacon candy. I liked the house chips dip, wish the chips were fresh made in house.   My wife had the Forrest and I had the Soppreseta. We both LOVED the Soppreseta, it alone is worth coming for. The mushrooms on the Forrest were also excellent, it was just that the Soppreseta was so much more flavorful. Crust was very tasty.   Overrall would HIGHLY recommend, this may be my new favorite pizza place",

Another example of why this is not your grandfathers...or fathers downtown.  They have 30 taps...all with QUALITY micro brews!  The most common beer they had was Bells 2 hearted or Victory Prima Pils.  Had 5 brewers that I had never heard of!  I have lived in NYC, Philly, Bmore, DC, Pittsburgh and sampled the beer scene in every major city in the US.  This place had the highest quality selection of American micro brews I have ever seen...EASY.  Waitstaff and bar tenders were personable and fast.  Pizza was good...not great...but got job done.  I did not sample any of the other food.  If you are in or near downtown Pittsburgh and like craft beer this place should be your first stop...and likely will end up being your only stop!",

The crust has a great doughy chew despite being thin/brick oven, and I was a big fan of the carnivore toppings.   Have to dock one star for service and one for beer price/selection. They only had two bartenders handling a large bar (beer/wine/cocktails) plus getting orders for the wait staff. Our bartender was friendly and efficient, but we waited over ten minutes each time we finished a round, and had to skip our last beer to get the check and run to a ballgame. He was absolutely swamped.   Beer list was long but unimpressive. Focusing on regional beers is great, but four Yards taps is four too many, especially at $6/7 a pour. I'll pay $7 for something brought in from the West Coast etc, but not for middle of the road regional beers. Worth a second visit for a downtown pizza craving, especially if they add happy hour pricing.",

I stopped in with my friend for lunch and left with more than enough to cover my dinner later in the day.  We both took our time looking over the menus before we were firm in our decisions.  There is a food menu and a drink menu, make sure to look over both as to not waste any time when the server stops back.    When our server arrived we both had our order ready.  I decided that the pesto pizza was exactly what I needed at that point in my day.  To say that this is fresh is a huge understatement and does not do it justice one bit.  Fresh dough topped with house made mozzarella cheese, EVOO, nice chunks of tomatoes, caramelized onions, and some of the best pesto I have ever tasted.  And coming from that brick oven made that pizza just that much better.  Each bite did a dance in my mouth, the flavors were so amazing that I was half tempted to eat it all in that sitting.  But I refrained knowing that later that day I would be able to come back to my leftovers and be mighty happy.  The beers on tap are quite extensive and switch up often.

I had the Margherita pizza - perfect sauce (fresh and just a tad sweet), fresh mozzarella and fresh basil on a lovely wood fired oven baked crust that has the right amount of chewiness and crispness. My favorite dishes are those that are so simple yet so delicious. This was all accompanied by a Pittsburgh Mule, made with local vodka, ginger beer and lime in a copper mug.

He brought up \"the place near the eye ball park\" and i knew he meant Proper Brick Oven since we have been meaning to try it out.   We had about 30 minutes of my lunch left and i wasn't sure if it would leave us enough time, but it worked out great. We ordered drinks and then ordered our meal as they were delivered. We went with the Pesto which is described on the menu as: 'oven-roasted Roma tomato, caramelized onion, basil pesto, house-cured bacon, house mozzarella, grated Pecorino-Romano & garlic oil'. Honestly, it was one of the best pizzas i have tasted. I'm not a \"pizza person\" & don't go searching for the city's #1, but i was very satisfied with this one. Every topping was very flavorful and tasty. Oh, another plus- the pizza came out in aboutt (or less than) than 10 minutes. Also, Bobby gave two thumbs up on his long island & the list of beer on tap was amazing!  Service was great as well as the ambiance. As tasty as the pizza was, i wish the toppings were spread out a little more evenly. Some slices were full of bacon while others didnt seem to have 2 pieces & other slices didnt seem to have any of those delicious tomatoes. Again this isn't a huge deal for how tasty the pizza was, it just would have just been better to experience the whole pizza on every slice.",

    "text": "Been here three times. The first two times I dined in and had the carnivore pizza, which is very good. The second time I also tried their chorizo soup, which was good but on the verge of salty and the small piece of bread that came with it was stale and felt like an afterthought. On my third visit, I got their chicken vegetable soup and snapper as take out. I was disappointed to find that the soup was tiny (served in an 8 oz deli), especially for $7. Again, the associated bread was not great. The snapper was good, but some of the vegetables it came with were overly charred.  I wanted to give 4 stars, but I really felt they skimped on the soup and bread. Not sure I would come back for the pizza alone.",

I have been here twice now and will definitely be back. Prosciutto wrapped shrimp starter is awesome and the Pig and Fig pizza is delish! The spiced Mojito is good but tastes like a regular Mojito and I didn't taste the \"spice.\" The atmosphere is intimate with dim lighting but the volume level is normal. Many beers to try as well as wines and some specialty mixed drinks. Service is quick and has been friendly. Can't wait to come back here!",

    "text": "Okay, I am writing this while dining here. So this is being written live (fancy right?).   To start, they have 1 bathroom upstairs - for 1 person only. Others are down stairs to use. No biggy.   The waiter on the other hand, started off saying hello etc. We told him our spouses were in the bathroom ( 4 of us total). We made a joke about them always having small bladders, he proceeded to tell us about he went to a strip club he went to during a noon time and how water was $4 per glass.  The water we got tasted fine. No off tastes. So fine   So, just laughed it off... but pretty weird. Luckily our spouses weren't at the table.   Other wise he's been good so far, he just took our orders and was very plain. Again, no biggy.   Just put an order in.  * 1 pepperoni pagnotta  * BLT salad * 1 margarita pizza  * 1 carnivore pizza   So waiting now. - is its 530 on Sunday - so the steelers are playing. Busyness is about 3/5. We were sat quickly - no wait.   We've been waiting for our food for about 5 minutes only. On a good track so far.   UPDATE: took about 10 mins for the salad and pepperoni pagnotta to get here. BLT Salad was amazing.   The pepperoni bread was not so good. It came with marinara sauce - which was awesome!! The actual pepperoni bread was not good. Hated it actually. It was dry, over cooked, and cold in the center. We don't even want to finish it. - don't get it, seriously if it's going to be similar to that. It's like it's been sitting out. Awful. The sauce again though, great.   We ended up returning it and not getting anything else. They just removed off of our bill for us. They were great about it.   Our pizza took about 15 mins total (for both) to get here. 15 minutes for 2 pizzas i think is great timing.   The pizza - were damn good. The carnivore pizza was awesome tasting with all of the meat. The margarita pizza was also good. Sort of bland. But would def get it again over all.   We didn't want dessert, our 2 friends got \"Emily's chocolate cake\". So waiting for it now. Be back in 1 second when you look below this lel.   (Misc not while waiting for the cake; our water that comes in a stylish water bottle, has been empty and hasn't been refilled for a while. Again, not the end of the world.)   Okie we're back. Took about 7-8 mins max to get here. I think it was well worth the wait. Looks tremendous, the plating looks top notch as well as the overall color pallet.   Out of 10 (10 being one of the best desserts they've ever had), they rated it 9. Which is phenomenal!   Over all I would give it a 3.  Why 3/5? *The waiter wasn't warm & told a very crude story within 10 seconds of meeting him.  * The pepperoni pagnotta was seriously awful * The pizza was soggy even though being baked at 800 degrees *  No water refill at all *  Didn't come to the table often  - What saved it  * The taste of the pizza and salad was awesome * The dessert was insanely wonderful * They were kind about returning the food - which I certainly hope they would be.  Pizza taste and dessert saved it from a 2 star",

At my table everyone was raving about the Bianca pizza which I ended up tasting from one of my friends. That pizza definitely was superrrrr good! I recommend it if you're in the mood to get a pizza. I ended up getting the scallops pasta which is delicious. They even add these flakes that make the pasta spicy. If you like spicy don't remove the flakes!   Luckily I was visiting a friend here in Pittsburgh and he took us here. If you're in the downtown area, check out this great Italian restaurant! :)",

No reservations for parties less than 6 either.    Overall, the place is pricey for both the food and drinks that they serve.  The pizza's are 10\" and cost about $17.  The size is barely enough for two so you do have to order something else unless you are not that hungry.  As for the taste, the pizza is supposed to be brick oven what was way too soggy for the brick oven pizza I'm used to.  The topping and combinations were just okay.  I would not return here.  There are plenty of other pizza places in this city:",

    "text": "The Proper Tavern is a great little place tucked away in the heart of Pittsburgh.   When you stop in, be sure to try their cocktails. The BlackBerry Smash and the Pittsburgh Mule are both excellent for an evening drink.   I recommend the appetizers. They're known for their candied bacon, and so we of course had to try it, along with their pepperoni roll and their homemade chips. A great way to have a light dinner.   For entrees, the pizza is defeinitely a winner, and if they have their specialty empanadas, those come highly recommended as well. If you're looking for a lighter fare, the Amalti Salad and be sure to add the shrimp, they were divine. The chicken and dumpling soup is another great way to have a lighter dinner.   The only thing we had a problem with is the carbonara. Everyone in my party tried it, unbelieving that it wouldn't taste good, considering the high quality of the other food. But the carbonara tasted like wet noodles and flavorless mush. My brother, a carbonara officianado--he's had carbonara all over the world, Rome, Florence, are two stands out and unfortunately this carbonara did worse than just falling short, it was truly inedible.   While I highly recommend this place for a night out with friends or adult family (this place isn't very super kid friendly, but you can definitely get by with a kid or two with an elevated palette or who likes cheese pizza) and definitely a place to stop in for drinks, but my advice would be to avoid the carbonara.",

We got the Pittsburgh pizza with potato and onions on it and could not have been happier. My wife got a Moscow Mule and said it was perfect.  The staff was attentive and very nice.

Overall, for lunch, the cost is reasonable for downtown Pittsburgh. No more than $30 for my two drinks, & pizza. The carnivore pizza is fantastic; I can't imagine ordering anything else!  Be aware- seating is quite crowded and they don't take reservations unless you're a large group. It can get noisy because of this but frankly, with food this good, if you care about that at all this isn't the place for you!",

Though there weren't many customers the hostess seemed to question where to seat us. She ended up cleaning off a small table for us. Our waitress was nice but talked so fast that I had to ask her to repeat herself twice.  I ordered the Tacchino with a side if house made chips. It was a good choice. It has smoked turkey and bacon candy on it. Each bit was savory with a tiny touch of sweetness. The chips were thin and crispy.  My husband ordered the Chicken Caprese. It was also very good. He chose pickled vegetables as his side. They are served cold and are spicy. He loved them.  One of the things that was annoying was a couple brought their toddler and a baby in with them. Now, I like kids, but my theory is that you shouldn't bring young children into places that don't have children's menu. The toddler was loud and all over the place. It was very disruptive to the quiet and cozy atmosphere.  We will definitely be back to try the pizza and beer.",

    "text": "In Proper, I've found yet another great restaurant for pre-show dinner in the Cultural District, and another great wood-fired pizza place downtown.  (As usual, Yelp comes through again!)  I visited for dinner last night prior to seeing the Book of Mormon at Heinz Hall with a friend, and it didn't disappoint.  Based on other reviewers' advice, I suggested that we start off with an order of the bacon candy.  This didn't take much convincing on my friend's part, since he's a major bacon aficionado.  His verdict, and I quote, was, \"This is the best bacon I've ever tasted!\" I haven't been to bacon night at Harris Grill, but he has, and he claims this bacon puts theirs to shame.  For my part, I can only say that I fully endorse his statement about it being the best bacon I'd ever tasted.  The flavor was rich, smoky, and complex, with the perfect salty/sweet balance.  Should you pay Proper a visit, I highly recommend that you try it!  For our entree, we decided on the pesto pizza, which, in addition to pesto, is topped with Roma tomatoes, caramelized onions, bacon bits (the real kind), and mozzarella, with a generous sprinkle of freshly-grated parmesan cheese.  While the flavor of the toppings was good overall, I concur with Jason F.'s comment that some bites that included only one or a couple of the ingredients tasted strange, since not all of the flavors could meld together as intended.  Additionally, the pesto was a bit different than my friend I had envisioned--it was rather concentrated, and dotted on the pizza, rather than having a creamier consistency and the spreading, as we'd imagined--which made its flavor overpowering at points. On the positive side, the flavor of the caramelized onions was good, and added a nice note to overall flavor the pizza.  (This is a really positive endorsement from me, since I usually dislike onions and was considering removing them.)  Also, unlike one of the other wood-fired pizzas I've tried at another restaurant downtown, the crust was a bit on the thicker side, and was crispy throughout, so they did a good job cooking the pie.  The bacon plus one pie was sufficient for the two of us, b/c we didn't want leftovers since we were heading to the show afterward, and it worked out well.  In addition to the food, my friend and I both ordered the cider snap, a seasonal cocktail that includes apple cider and vodka.  It was sweet, but not overly so, and we both enjoyed it very much.  (I particularly enjoyed the piece of sugared ginger that came with it as a garnish!)  It definitely made for a great start to the meal, and complemented the bacon candy well once it was served.  My friend also ordered an IPA--I forget the exact name, but it was the hoppiest one on the menu, according to the waitress.  It actually turned out to be a bit too hoppy for my friend, but he ordered it at his own risk, in light of the waitress's verdict!  In the interest of time, my friend and I opted to sit at the bar--we were able to find two seats at the far end without a problem.  We enjoyed the ambiance, which includes exposed brick and ball jar \"shades\" on the lights dangling from the ceiling.  Service was efficient, and we had no issues making it to the show on time, even though we arrived a bit later than we'd planned.  One more thing: My friend left his sunglasses on the bar when we left.  Ironically, just as he was describing his tendency to lose sunglasses to me, as if on cue, a waiter caught us on the corner and returned his sunglasses.  For that alone, the service gets a 5+ star rating!",

They use the brick oven, which gives a great smoke flavor and puts a nice crisp on the crust.  They do have some unusual combo of flavors on their pizzas.  I tried a Mediterranean pizza. Artichokes and olives and onions, oh yeah!   The restaurant has a few different things to order, but if you get a pizza you wont need much else.  The pizzas are a good size.   The wine list is is fine.  Nothing special on it.  The beers list is better.  You can get a sampler tray, which I love.  They bring you 5 different beers to try on the sampler and you can pick the ones you want to try.",

    "text": "I stopped by here last night for dinner with my wife.  We didn't really get to see much of the inside since it was a nice night and we wanted to sit outside.  The outside of the restaurant had a nice view of the city and while roped off from the rest of the sidewalk it didn't prevent a panhandler from asking us for money.  For our entrees my wife and I decided to split the fig and the pig pizza and also the carbonara pasta.  The pig part of the pizza was prosciutto and it contrasted nicely with the sweetness of the figs.  However there were some instances with the pizza where I just got the prosciutto without the fig and thought that those bites were a bit too salty for me.  The pizza crust itself was nice and crispy and also had a good garlic flavor when eaten without toppings.   Our entree was the carbonara pasta and whenever it was first brought out to us I thought that it looked like a small portion for the price.  However, the bowl was deceiving and there was much more pasta than it looked like.  The carbonara was made up of house-made tagliatelle with house-made black pepper bacon, a fresh egg and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  While I really ended up enjoying the taste of the pasta, most of that was due to the overpowering flavor of the pepper on the bacon.  I will say that the noodles themselves were pretty decent and I did really enjoy the creaminess of the sauce as well.  For dessert my wife and I decided to split their pumpkin cheesecake.  It was rich and decadent with a great pumpkin flavor that we both enjoyed.  The bottom line for me is that I will be back here again in the future.  All of the food that we had was good and I think that Proper is a nice addition to the downtown dining scene.",

Now to the good part...  I'm usually not one to complain so I was reluctant to say anything but the waiter noticed I hadn't touched my food. I told him I couldn't eat the pasta and he immediately got the manager. Kevin (the manager) was AMAZING. I didn't want to make a big stink but Kevin was quick to take care of it. He offered something else but at that point I just wanted to call it a night. He took the pasta off the bill and sent me home with a delicious cheesecake. Yah, I'm easily bought...but I was pretty impressed with how considerate the staff were.   I wouldn't go here again for dinner, but there was an extensive beer list.

The brush they used to 'clean' the bottom of the brick oven- the surface on which they cook the pizza - was being stored on the floor.  Yes, the tool used to brush the burnt cornmeal in the oven was touching the floor.  Ack!",

The decor, exposed brick oven, and display of taps made for an intimate and cozy yet chic interior. The beer selection was extensive and pretty unique, and luckily they offer flights for $10 if you're indecisive like I am. Bartender was friendly and knowledgeable about the beers on tap. Noise level inside was very mild and great for drinks and a conversation. At least from what I could see and smell the food looked good too!",

Sorry :-( We came here after a show at the Benedum, what a perfect location, we just had to cross the street. Upon arriving we were told there would be a 30 minute wait, but we got seated within 10 minutes. It was kind small inside. Pretty much a vertical set up. Bench like seating all along the wall and chairs on the opposite sides of the table. There was also a bar area behind the tables, a bigger, open spaced area towards the back for larger parties and seating at the brick oven. We sat in the chairs at the table and we were constantly being bumped into by the servers, patrons, and the people leaving from the bar seating. The table space was also small with a party of 4. We ordered 3 different appetizers and there was not much space to set them down. The table was cleared before our entrees came out. Our server was very friendly and efficient.  All of our food came out pretty quickly and it was all delicious. A little pricey, but in that area I think they were one of the lower priced restaurants.  The server did check on us multiple times. We got desserts to go, they were good, but a little disappointed that they didn't pack the ice cream for the peach cobbler In a separate container because it was a melted mess when we got home. So it was good food, but small space and packaging of take out was not thought out too wel",

Proper is located in the theatre district and very easy to find. Dine at a table or at the bar---preferred, so you can chat it up with the other patrons. The ambience is warm and casually classy.   I dined on their Amalfi salad and the carnivore pizza minus sausage, add mushrooms. One bite of the salad with the juicy kalamatas and lemon shallot vinaigrette left me just wanting more and more of it. Something so basic yet so full of flavor--it was good. The pizza was cooked perfectly...brick oven pizza with chewy crust and delicious sauce slathered on just right with a nice  throw of meat and oozing cheese. I mean damn...just get you some!  Lastly, my cocktail for the evening was the blackberry rhubarb smash that was simply righteous.  Rum combined with the fruits, iced tea  made edgy with some lemon. It was delish. Nothing left to say...except GO GET YOU SOME!",

    "text": "My son requested his birthday dinner be here. He'd already been with his step-dad and I had yet to try it. We showed up about 6:20 on a Wednesday and there was no wait and there was plenty of space between guests; it didn't start filling up until we were leaving around 7:45pm.  We decided to just go family style and ordered a bunch of stuff to share: -Proper house chips- Nothing fancy here, just a reasonable serving of fresh sliced potato chips with a really tasty French onion dip.  -Famous bacon candy- After trying one slice I didn't want to share this, but alas, there were 4 of us. Sticky sweet and smoky and delicious! It's a small serving though so maybe only share with one. -Beer mussels- I've had some badly cooked mussels, so I often get nervous trying new ones. These were fantastic! The beer/butter broth had a great flavor and the mussels weren't over cooked, they were perfect. -Pancetta wrapped shrimp- Huge shrimp wrapped with crispy pancetta; I brushed the balsamic drizzle off because it seemed like too much but it was really good.  -Margherita pizza- The sauce was -really- sweet; I wasn't a fan.  -Forest pizza- If you don't love mushrooms, skip this; it's loaded with them and the flavor is heavy. I liked it, but one slice was enough.  I also ordered myself a bowl of spinach artichoke soup; by the time it came out I didn't even think I had room for it until I had a bite. I had room. The artichoke was subtle and the cream base was smooth; all of the flavors were complimentary and the texture was A+.   The kids split the chocolate cake. I had a bite of course, and it was extremely rich but good.   Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive.  Overall this was a really enjoyable experience and I'd definitely like to come back and try some of the large beer selection.",

It was however, very good.  I went with a group and we sat at one of their 2 high top tables.  Most of the other tables are along the wall, and there's not a ton of room to walk from one end of the restaurant to the other since the chairs are pretty close to the bar.  This was especially True on a cold November night when everyone had fluffy coats as well.   Anyway, our group got a mix of the house salad and their chicken and dumpling soup.  Both were thoroughly enjoyed.  We then split 3 pizzas 1.the black and gold pizza - potatoes and red onion.  I think this was my favorite, but they were all very good 2. The Bianca - a bunch of different cheeses - also very good 3. The Greco (New) - which had braised lamb.  This was probably the table favorite.  The lamb was such a unique addition to pizza.    They also have a great alcohol selection and the staff was excellent.  I'll definitely be coming back",

We were underwhelmed during our first visit so selecting this location before our show at the theater was a last minute choice. But we are so glad we made the choice to go back. First let me tell you the place was crowded, but we were able to be seated immediately probably because we arrived early around 5:30.   Our waiter, Tyler, was very friendly and helpful to make a few suggestions on what we should order. This time we stayed away from pizza that we ordered the first visit, which was in our opinion just average.  This time we elected to have an appetizer which we chose the crispy duck wings and in all honesty they were just average and we probably wouldn't order them again, however our entrees were beyond fabulous. We ordered the barbecue brisket mac & cheese and the amazing grilled shrimp with butternut squash risotto. I can't say enough about how fabulous both of these dishes were and I would certainly go back there just to order those again. I will be dreaming about that risotto for a long time. I suppose your experience depends on what you order. But do go and enjoy this place when in town.",

    "text": "We weren't overly impressed with Proper on our first visit shortly after they first opened, so we never went back. Fortunately, a work lunch took me back recently and the experience was much MUCH better this time around! It certainly left me wanting to return soon!  Atmosphere was never the issue. It's a comfortable, warm space. The large bar top eats up quite a bit of space, but it does serve a purpose when dining at the bar, as there's never an issue with finding room for the pizza dishes and your drink to coexist. The staff is nice, and service the last time around was much more attentive. The first time we went, we sat at the bar in a relatively-empty restaurant. Service was insanely slow, drinks weren't refilled, etc. On my latest visit with a group of 6, service was quick and drinks were topped off very regularly, so I'll mark that as either an overall improvement, or a sign that table service is stronger than bar service.  As far as the bar goes, Proper offers up a large draft selection and a bunch of mixed drink options which should please the majority of patrons. If beer is your thing, you'll definitely find something worthwhile. If you're looking for a mind-blowing mixed drink, you might not find it here, but you won't be disappointed, either. Besides...you're here for the pizza!  That's what will ultimately bring me back to Proper: the pizza. The margherita pizza is excellent. There wasn't a lot of cheese on the pie, but the highlight was definitely their sweeter sauce and crust. The crust on their pizza almost has the flavor of a pan pizza more than a brick oven-style pizza, but that's simply an observation, not a complaint. It's a bit thicker than some neapolitan pizzas, with a crispier outside and soft inside. Perhaps that, too, is what reminded me more of a pan pizza crust.  I also had the carnivore; Proper's pie for meat lovers. For me, it was the perfect amount of meat. Not too much, not too little. Just the right amount of spice from the sausage and saltiness from the bacon. It was good, despite meat-heavy pizzas being far from my favorite. The most interesting pizza I tried on our visit was the \"harvest.\" Talk about a blast of Fall for your palette. Butternut squash, pumpkin sauce, crispy sage, sweet italian sausage, fresh mozz, and nutmeg. Yes, it tastes as strangely delicious as it sounds, and while the make-everything-imaginable-taste-like-pumpkin craze seems out-of-hand these days, the harvest pizza is worth checking out while you can get it.  Ultimately, the improved service and delicious margherita will bring me back, and as someone who works downtown, it's nice to have another lunch or dinner option to be excited about! Enjoy!",

It is not large so I can see it getting very busy, but we went late on a Tuesday and were seated immediately.  The hostess greeted us with a welcoming smile.   Our server was tied up with a large party, so another server brought us waters while we decided on drinks. This was a great touch! It's the little things that matter to me because customer service is a dying art. When our server, Lee, approached us, she was genuine and answered all of our questions. We went with a beer flight to share which was a great way to sample some of their MANY draft beers.   We started with a pepperoni roll and Cheese platter. The bread was definitely homemade. The pepperoni roll was dense and flavored perfectly with Italian herbs and spices. It was paired with a house marinara that was awesome. The cheese platter came with a homemade fresh mozzarella drizzled with balsamic glaze and fresh basil, a deliciously creamy burrata, and a wonderful grana Padano topped with lemons soaked in honey. We were fighting over the last bits of cheese! Being kind of full from the starters, we opted for a pizza Bianca for dinner. We added pepperoni and basil. What a treat! When it was delivered, we thought we won't eat all of this, but somehow we managed.  We took a piece of homemade pineapple cheesecake back to the hotel for dessert. What a great decision! It was creamy, sweet, and we wished we had more.   Overall, this was a fantastic dining experience. The hostess' greeting, our awesome server (which is rare these days), great beer, and truly delicious food.",

My wife and I got margherita and sopressato pizzas, respectively. Both were delicious. (So delicious, in fact, that several days later when we were strapped to find another late meal near our hotel, we carried out the same order.)  Service was good. A bit hands-off due to it being end of the night, but attentive enough.",

I see a classic brick interior and I'm already comfortable.  Being on travel and eating alone is tough for me .  A good wait staff, comfortable setting, good food and drinks can go a long way to putting me at ease .   This place has it.  Amazing beers, even though I was in a martini state of mind, nice menu, and attentive professional staff.   My choices were all good - vodka martini, up a few olives, a risotto with clams and shrimp entree (perfect except a bit heavy on the butter ) .  No room for dessert.  The pizza looks like a hit based on the orders rolling out.  5 stars for sure !",

Here's what I like: - The setting is comfortable and fresh.  - They have a great variety of excellent and unique beers.  - The brick oven pizza is excellent. - Service is decent.   The Pizza It's thin crust is almost crispy but still flexible. The dough itself has a good flavor. The sauce just tastes like ripe tomatoes, which I like, and is not sweet. There is minimal cheese, but it is in the form of lumps of fresh mozzarella and tastes so good.   I'll be back.",

    "text": "I'd say it's really a 3.5er but I'll give the round up because they so awesomely sheltered us from the green storm. Cool vibe; dark and quiet which was a very welcome respite from the throngs of St. Patty's Day party people loudly stumbling about the city in their green shirts, beads, hats, tutus, socks, sunglasses, face paint, unicycles, etc. Bar was very clean and extremely well organized and the stools were super comfortable after a day of sightseeing.  Lots of beers of numerous styles on tap, mostly local. My triple IPA (Helltown Brewing's \"Idle Hands\") was delicious as was my cocktail, a black pepper Paloma, both of which I highly recommend. Bartender offered recommendations and was more-or-less attentive. Bianca pizza ($15 for the only size; shareable as a snack/individual as a dinner) sat for awhile as I stared longingly knowing it was ours and it was getting colder by the second :( When we did finally receive it, it had good flavor but way too much ricotta for my liking and only my first slice was hot because it sat for so long. Crust was good at the top but more soggy than desirable underneath the toppings. Ultimately, I could've done without the pizza.   I'd absolutely recommend this place for date night drinks at the bar and some intimate conversation or just a relaxed place to sit and drink a tasty beer, not sure if I'd come back for more pizza though.",

For four people, we ordered 3 pizzas and 2 salads and an appetizer - there were a few slices left and we all left stuffed!  The crust is a really good balance - not too thin, but the ring of crust had enough heft to it to hold it straight. B  Bianca - the stand out!!! typically not a big fan of white pizzas, but this was fantastic the ricotta and mozzarella together was sublime. And the crust had a slight oily and garlicky flavor to it.   Carnivore - pretty standard with \"all de meats\" but still good  Margherita - also pretty standard but still good   Bacon candy - delicious, crispy, lean and sweetly spicy. Nice....  Amalfi and BLT salads - both generous, fresh, light dressing",

The beers were great, one was Great White. Oh one person had the bbq mac and cheese it was so good! I loved my pork bolognese it was so good and the noodles were large flat ones.

The restaurant has a sit in bar with a TV to watch which I found very attractive and they do serve food at the bar table!! I felt the place was bit congested because only one way traffic is allowed at certain parts making the customer bit uncomfortable.   We ordered a Mediterranean pizza. Very much liked it coz of thin crust and just the right amount of cheese and seasoning!!!   Will definitely visit next time to try out other menu thought the options are limited to 3 for vegetarians!!",

    "text": "Meh. I've experienced better. This place runs like someone failing at the game diner dash, where people walk out if you ignore them for too long, or don't bring the bill fast enough.   I would say this, if you're a tourist staying downtown Pittsburgh don't waste your time on this place.  Unless you're walking in for lunch, or a post dinner rush meal do not bother.  If you're looking for a quick bite or drink, don't bother.  If you value customer service...don't bother.  I tried to make a reservation but they don't make them for groups under 6....let me tell you there is maybe 1 table for six in the tiny restaurant.  We arrived at 615pm, we waited in the awkward foyer freezing for an hour. The hostess was pretty indifferent and annoyed with our presence.  The only reason we even stayed was that we were waiting for a friend to meet us there.  In the hour that we hovered in the 70s style foyer, we told everyone who walked in to leave because it wasn't worth it to go in.  Probably turned away about 10 people.  When we arrived there seemed to be a lot of groups of middle aged people who were wasted.  Like a lot, in fact as we left drunk moms were piling into a minivan and giving the waitress the finger. Super classy.    So we sat down, ordered beers- the golden monkey was meh.    Ordered the italian cheese plate, and pepperoni bread. 1 of the 3 cheeses was really good, one was meh, and one was covered completely in balsamic. Not great.  Ordered the Margherita  Pizza and the carnivore, both came and were very fresh. So yes the ingredients were very fresh, but it wasn't like something earth shattering.  Maybe I'm just a pizza guru, but it wasn't all that and a bag of chips for me.  Standard brick oven pizza.  We had the chocolate cake, which was very very dense and we couldn't finish it....and not in a good way.  I have to say that while dining we asked for Ranch dressing, and apparently the owner is completely against ranch dressing being at the establishment at all. So no ranch,  in case that's something you like on your pizza.  Also took a lot to get pepper flakes as well.  Over all, I was not impressed. I wish we had gone somewhere else because this place was really not worth the hype people talked about it or the time we spent there.  Pittsburgh has much better places to eat, try meat and potatoes if you can get a reservation.",

Only small point of feedback and I wouldn't dock the 5 point score for it but want to put out there: they only have 1 soup that is sausage based.  I recall  wedding soup or pasta fagioli in the past that was great and lighter.  Would love to see this brought back.  Also they have really good pasta.  They should add a rigatoni with marinara sauce straight up pasta similar to what Il Pizziolo has.  Again, minor items not taking away the 5 star score.  The straight up margarita pie is so awesome and always amazing beers to select from.",

While I notice a lot of wood fired pizza doughs taste pretty similar... proper stands out with its unique tasting dough.   Some co-workers and I stopped in for lunch one day and I couldn't wait to take my mama the next time! The pizza is thrown into an 800 degree brick oven before making it to your dinner table and they let the made from scratch dough rise for 3 days before it is used. I really haven't tasted a dough quite like propers which is why I think it is the best wood fired pizza in Pittsburgh and I have tried a lot. I ordered the Bianca which is delicious! If you love ricotta cheese you must get this pizza. My mom ordered the margarita pizza and she had no complaints. We both took our leftovers home because they are pretty big pizzas and come with 8 slices. My mom ordered the house chips to start and it came with French onion dip on the side. She really raved about these chips for a while! Some people might think the pizzas are a little pricey, but it is so worth every penny because this isn't just your average tasting pizza. Their menu isn't just all about pizza, they have soups, sandwiches, pastas and salads. Also I can't forget the pretty awesome tap selection. Our server was very attentive when it came to our drinks, boxes and making sure our food was tasting okay. If you have Proper on your radar, get there fast... you will not be disappointed!",

Their pre-selected pizzas are very very good. I would come back here in a heartbeat just for pizza. They also had a very good selection of drafts. Service was also very good.   The wait was a bit long and the food took a little bit, but it was a busy night.",

Place is cozy, smell wood fire, and it has nice booths and seating areas, mostly indoor. Few tables outside.",

I went here with my boyfriend the other day and both of us were blown away by how good everything was. We started out with the bacon candy (because we have some semblance of sanity). It was sticky and sweet with a good level of spice. We then shared the carnivore pizza. The pie was cooked perfectly with a good amount of toppings and a delicious, garlicky crust. On top of it, I got to discover my new favorite beer, Green Flash Serrano Stout. Oh my! If you are familiar with how well chilies pair with chocolate, you know this is delicious. All around, the meal was perfect and I can't wait to go back!",

I absolutely enjoyed my old fashioned and my friend the same. Perfect mixture and had a very strong Rye taste.   For food, we ordered the Charcuterie Board, Carnivore Pizza, and Banana Bread Pudding. All amazing! Nothing completely outstanding though. The Board was almost like an antipasto but not quite. Just three varieties of meat with bread. The meat was definitely fresh and the bread was soft, with a nice texture. Freshly baked for sure. The Pizza was outstanding. The meat flavor was not overwhelming, the sauce complemented the meat and the crust very nicely. The cheese was just enough to complement the rest of the ingredients rather than overtake the pizza. The bread pudding was perfect. It was light, not heavy at all. There were chunks of bananas in it but there wasn't a strong banana flavor, but kinda savory flavor. It was nice. The bread was cooked just right to have that pudding vibe to it and complemented the chunks of bananas.   The bartender was awesome! She was soloing the bar with a very busy crowd. But we did not wait a long time and she was always there when we needed it.",

    "text": "Such a cute place in such as convenient location! My dinning companions and I had high hopes for this place after seeing all the great reviews, but we left disappointed. Everything seemed ok at first. It was super crowded on a Saturday evening because of a bunch of events going on in Downtown. The hostess told us it will be a 30 minute wait, but we were seated within 15 minutes (yay!). Our waiter seemed like a quirky fella and the food options looked promising.   We ordered the meat lover pizza and the pesto pizza. The food came in a timely manner. The pizzas were super fresh with top-notch ingredients. The pizza crusts were so crispy and delightful. Everything went so well until we ran out of water. Our waiter was nowhere to be found and we were all parched. The crowd cleared out and still our waiter was nowhere in sight. We had to flag down the manager and asked for more water. After the eating, drinking and talking, we waited again for our bill. A good 20-minute went by and still no sign of the waiter. When we finally flagged him down, he said a few minutes, which turned into another 10 minute. Once we got our bill, it's another 10 minute before we got our receipts and permission to leave.   I spent the majority of my dinning experience waiting around, not much eating. The pizzas were delicious, but the service needs to be reassessed. I'm not sure if I'm willing to give this place another try, maybe one day when I have enough time to afford waiting around.",

Okay, now that's out of way, the food is good. The pizzas are decent sized and they use quality ingredients. I go for lunch sometimes and usually order a sandwich rather than the pizza, but definitely try the Black Pepper Bacon Candy as an appetizer  Alright, the reason I am giving it 3 stars is because I was there with coworkers for lunch and sat by the pizza oven at the lower-level bar. One of my coworkers ordered the \"ocean\" pizza, which contains shellfish. The pizza maker made all of the pizzas without changing his gloves or washing his hands in between.",

I ordered the wings which is a new menu item, do not bother with those, from a wing fanatic they are below average.  Not to mention he wings were $13 for 6.  Though the beer selection is great, though again over priced.  I am drinking the Double Vice CoffeePorter which is also very good, though $7.50/pint.  It is a pricier establishment than what I am used to in Indianapolis, but decent beer selection.  Nothing special, but not bad.",

    "text": "A great place for unique brick oven pizzas! We ordered the Black & Gold pizza, which has white sauce, 2 or 3 different types of cheese, onion, and crispy potato slices. The flavor of the sauce was delicious, I wish there was more of it on the pizza because there was very little on the dough. The crispy potato slices were the second best part of the pizza. It added a great change in texture. The crust was baked nicely and not burnt by the brick ovens, which are proudly on display in the restaurant. The pizza is about 8 small slices, so of you're hungry make sure to order a few or get an appetizer. Our waiter was great, he gave us enough time to choose our meal, came to fill out water glasses frequently, and never pressured us to hurry up and leave the table. The restaurant itself has a modern feel and has interesting seating arrangements at the bar, around the brick oven, and then a bunch of tables against the wall. Seats are pretty close together, so conversations aren't really private. Keep in mind that they will be very crowded if there is a show at the Benedum.",

    "text": "A rewrite is necessary after our last night visit to Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room.  We stopped in before heading over to the Benedum for a Valentine's Day showing of Alice in Wonderland presented by the PGH Ballet courtesy of Yelp (thank you Yelp).  We grabbed a quick beer and Matt decided he wanted to stop back after the show to grab one more since he really enjoyed his wheat beer, a Penn Weizen, from local Penn Brewery.    After the show ended we headed right back over.  All the staff seemed to be polite and attentive.  We ordered another round and by this time of the evening the place was clearing out so there was plenty of room at the bar.  Their bar is very classy and the seats are super comfy.    My tummy began to rumble, and although I am not usually one to eat that late at night I was considering ordering something, though I had never eaten here on any of my previous visits.  After some persuasion from my other half we decided to share a pizza.  They have some very unique pizzas on the menu.  I don't like a lot of greasy toppings on my pizza, AKA sausage, pepperoni ect.  I also rarely eat pizza, as it usually doesn't impress so calories VS the taste is not a fair trade in my mind.  That being said we were eyeing up this pesto pizza.  Quite unique lots of fresh elements and I love pesto, so I was sold.  The bartender told us we were welcomed to customize our selection but the pizza seemed well balanced so I didn't feel a need to customize it.    Our pie arrived quickly.  Perfect size for two, maybe three people.  We took a few slices home.  I really have no complaints.  It was a nice tasty crust, with the wood fire taste permeating through.  The toppings were all fresh and the pesto sauce gave it that extra special touch.  Still a four for being a tad on the expensive side, but now I can say the food lives up to the quality of the drinks.  Definitely recommend trying some food if you find yourself here.",

I remember they had good beer here but I forgot about their brick oven pizza.  When we walked in my wife (who doesn't really like pizza) thought it smelled good in there and it was making her hungry.  That's a good sign that there is good pizza here.       We got a beer each and then headed to our show.  I really wanted to stop back after the show to have another drink but it was nice in here and we were having a nice night.  So we did! We were a little hungry so we went over the menu and picked out a Pesto Pizza.  I like traditional pizza with tomatoes base pizza sauce, cheese, and meat on my pie.  Since we were sharing I went with one that my wife would like and I'm glad we picked this one.  It was so good.  It was a great brick oven pizza.  I want to come back to try some different pizza from here.       The atmosphere was good there too.  It's kind of dark but relaxed.  The seats are comfortable and the bar is nice and open.  It's nice to watch a sports game here.  The service was really good too.   When we go to a ballgame or attend another show we will be back here to get a drink and try another pizza for sure!",

The food was reasonably priced.  They have a few outdoor tables too, but it was a little too warm when we got there. Highly recommend, great place to take a date..",

    "text": "I have eaten at Proper several times so far and my experience has been mixed.  First, seating.  The wait time to eat here is generally long (greater than 1 hour even if you show up at 5:00) which would be acceptable except for the fact that their seating system is terrible.  You show up, your name gets penciled in on a paper list, and then you are handed a business card so that you can call them back some arbitrary time into the wait period to check-up on the table status.    Having to call the restaurant myself after I've already checked in is annoying enough, but the last time I ate here we called the hostess, returned to the restaurant because she informed us that our table was ready, checked in with the hostess in person, and then watched as another party the same size as ours further down on the wait list that checked in after we did was seated at our table by a separate employee who was apparently not in communication with the hostess who had since disappeared.  When we complained to the hostess when she reappeared that we had already spoken to her and were supposed to have been seated, she said that the table was taken and that it would be another 30 minute wait.  There is no reason for restaurant seating to be this needlessly convoluted and prone to failure.  We were seated as soon as another table cleared up, but it's things like this that make me never return to a restaurant.  They are in desperate need of a seating app that will text you when your table is ready and manage seating electronically.  Now, the food.  The crust is good as are the toppings, and all of the pizzas I've eaten here have been well balanced and tasty.  The appetizers I've sampled have been good as well.  Tough to say if the food is worth the wait though.  The beer selection is impressive, but I wish the bar didn't take up so much floor space in the restaurant because everything from aisles to seating is cramped, and if you're sitting across from somebody you're going to be stepping on their shoes the entire time.",

There are a few large tables in the front and the back with smaller tables in a row with bench style seating against the wall in the middle where the long bar is.  Chalkboard tap list over the bar is nice.  Trendy enough for a nice date spot, yet relaxed enough a place to just sit and grab a beer.  Drinks: Extensive beer list with fairly impressive offerings.  Price range for beers is 6-8 bucks.  Nice wine selection and craft cocktails as well.  Would like to try the Maggie's spiced rum Mojito sometime, though last night just had beer.  Food: Excellent all around.  We had the chips and ricotta spinach ball as our two appetizers and then shared the forest and carnivore pizzas.  Their pizza is wood-fired, Italian style thin crust.  Everything was super tasty, especially the forest pizza which had mushrooms and balsamic vinaigrette as well as caramelized onions.  Last time I was here I tried the bacon candy which was an awesome app.  Service:  Our waitress was very knowledgeable, attentive, and happy.  Food delivery was well timed.  No complaints here.  Overall:  Unassuming from the outside, this is a gem of a place in the cultural district with a great beer selection, trendy yet unpretentious ambiance, and awesome Italian style pizza.  As far as Italian style pizza in Pittsburgh goes, I would rate Proper Brick Oven's a half notch below Piccolo Forno and slightly above Mercurio's or Dinnette.",

The crust was very thin which one would expect, however, the sogginess ruined the expected texture.  The chicken was dry, but the crust was nice.

    "text": "We came here for the first time before a PSO concert. It was super packed (very small inside), but luckily we only had to wait 30 minutes for a table. The hostesses were very friendly and I especially didn't mind the wait because the heat from the brick oven flames was so toasty and inviting. They don't have any two-person tables. They only have 4-person tables at the minimum.  It's not a huge deal, but it takes longer to get a table and I can't imagine it's that efficient for the business. I will say, however, that the staff is super efficient. As soon as a party left, there were about 4 different servers working to clear the table as quick as possible.   We ordered the Roasted Roots salad, which was fantastic. The goat cheese truffles and roasted beets are what made the salad. All of the ingredients worked very well together. I would definitely order this again.   We also ordered the Forest pizza. It tasted amazing, but I don't know if I've ever had pizza that greasy. The crust was basically soggy with grease. Literally, grease was dripping down my hand. I could almost feel my arteries clogging as I ate it. Luckily, we shared it between the two of us. I couldn't imagine someone eating all of that greasy pizza by themselves. I'm torn, however, because while it was super greasy it still tasted amazing. It's just greasier than I normally prefer. It was cool to see the pizzas being made in the brick ovens near the bar area. Our server was also very attentive and our food came out super quickly.  Lastly, the craft draft list is awesome. We ordered two different beers from Voodoo Brewery, one of our favorites. I don't know if I'd order pizza from here again because it's too greasy for me. Again, that's just my personal preference. I would come again, however, for the Roasted Roots salad and the beer if I happened to be in the area.",

Had the bacon candy app and the chips and dip. Chips and dip was better as the dip is amazing. Bacon candy I would prefer it crisper but that is just a personal preference. As a special they had a sweet potato bisque that was to die for. For the last week I have been scouring the Internet trying to find a recipe that might be half as good. If this place was closer I would go multiple times a day for this soup.  Pizza and pasta was divine but please order the soup!",

We tried the bacon candy and one of the grilled pizzas.  Bacon candy was great, but not super crisp.  I could have ate a pound of it.  I can't recall the pizza toppings but the crust was on point!  I think anything you put on those pizzas and cook in a brick oven will be a winner.  Good draft beer list too.",

    "text": "Yummm.... I couldn't resist the temptation after hearing so much of this place from Yelp and local suggestions, so my family and I decided to stop here for lunch. We first started off with the house salad. The Bibb lettuce was fresh and crisp and not heavily doused with dressing (which had a great balance between sweetness and acidity- perfect with the pear!). It was topped with candied walnuts and goat cheese that gave the salad a nice crunchiness and savoriness.   As the for the pizza, it was good. But not amazing. Maybe it was just me? I ordered the Margarita Pizza that I shared with my mom. The crust is thin and chewy but the saucy part was a tad bit too soggy for me. Don't get me wrong; it was a good pizza, but it tasted like our homemade version... which is a bit disappointing if you paid $15 to have something more special (like the stone fire oven; so cool!).  My dad ordered the Chicken Caprese Sandwich. I had a bite, since he seemed to be enjoying it so much, and I have to say it was a pretty darn tasty sandwich. The chicken had a smoky char on it, and paired with the melted mozzarella, tomato and pesto, the whole sandwich rocked. I also enjoyed the pickled veggies that it came with.  Overall, I would recommend this place. Not only is the food yummy, but the atmosphere is nice. With friendly staff, dark-ish lighting, and sports turned on the screens, this place gives off a cool vibe that is great for casual dining with friends, families, and dates. Plus, although I don't drink alcohol, it was cool looking at all the choices of beer!",

The atmosphere is also really nice and they have some tvs on by the bar featuring sports games. There is only one bathroom but it is nice and clean. The location is good too since it's downtown near all the theaters and other bars if you want to bar hop after dinner. Worth a try and a return trip to have something new on the large menu. Service was also good. Overall very pleased.",

We did not have much of a wait in the evening after 7 and our group of four was seated quickly. I noticed that it was rather dim lighting which isn't a problem for me but I know some people do not like this at all. We started with the Hummus Trio which was delicious. The only problem was that we had to ask for additional pita because they give you so little. The waiter did not have a problem with this and surprisingly we were not charged extra. Two of us wanted a house salad and the waiter again come to the rescue telling us to just order the large house salad and he would bring two salad plates rather than each ordering a half. Less money and more food that way! I like this guy!  I also ordered a from scratch wood fired pesto pizza. Incredible!  This is not your typical pepperoni pizza place so keep that in mind. What you are getting is an authentic wood fired pie with fresh ingredients.    I greatly enjoyed our experience here and while I may not always be in the mood for this type of pizza, I'm glad to have finally tried it. I'll be back to try a few other options as well. The service was top notch! My one caveat here was their beer selection. Pretty much just your standard drafts. While there were a few craft selections, I'd like to see more variety. There are a lot of local options that would do great here!",

    "text": "I may have a new favorite place to eat downtown! I actually stopped in here twice in one night (yes, really) last week. The first time my friends and I had made dinner reservations, but due to a mix-up on what time our theater show started that night we didn't have time to eat much. So we returned after the show to sample more of the menu, because at that point, why not?  Both times we visited, the staff were excellent and considerate. They definitely wanted to make sure we made our show. Despite the place being jam packed, they took the time to make sure our food made it to our tables quickly They even brought our checks super early so we wouldn't have to wait on them later. So really, before even tasting the food, I was falling in love with the place, just because of the staff.  But oh my, the food! On round one here I ordered the Spinach-Ricotta Dumplings and an arsenal cider. Um, can you say yum? Because, yum. I would have eaten an entire bowl of those tasty tasty dumplings! But I didn't, and as a result, I had room for Brown butter scallops later that night. These are a current special which came with orzo rice, spinach, and a citrus-based sauce. I added a Pittsburgh Mule cocktail to my meal, and I proceeded to eat myself into the happiest state I've been in for quite a while. These scallops were great. I can't think of a dish or experience I could even compare it to. The saying \"explosion of flavor\" is a pretty apt description - every bite was heavenly! The Mule cocktail was admittedly mostly water by the time I finished it - there was a LOT of ice in there...but it certainly wasn't a huge deal, and I didn't care, because oh my gosh delicious scallops!  I 100% want to come back here. Actually, I need to come back, because there's a buckeye tart on their dessert menu that I did not get to sample last week. So watch out, Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room - as soon as the holiday rush dies down and I stand a chance at getting a table, you'll see me again! And I'll be raving about you in the meantime!",

There is a large bar with TV's so if you wanted to have a date night without missing an important game (*cough* a Steeler game), Proper Brick Oven would definitely bring that ambiance.  I'm not in love with the food.  The pizza is good, but I'm just not personally in love. You do get a decent amount of food for your money so it's definitely worth the price.  I think I was most impressed with the staff.  We went to Proper Brick Oven with a sizable group and they were able to split the check AND add the birthday boy's meal evenly to everyone's check.  It's a small thing, but it makes celebrating a birthday or event that much more enjoyable.",

I had never heard any buzz about Proper Brick Oven in the past, but after seeing how many strong reviews the restaurant had listed on Yelp, I knew that I had to check it out.  The location is very convenient to all of the downtown theaters, and the interior was warm and cozy and intimate. The cherry on top was the brick oven aroma that greeted you at the door. Our waiter was friendly, and our cocktails were very well crafted. Finally, the pizza - love love love. A lot of trendy pizza spots have very thin, crispy crust pizzas topped with trendy ingredients. Though Proper Brick Oven does have plenty of trendy ingredients - such as pork belly bacon and arugula - I absolutely love that the crust is much softer and doughier than the often-seen crispy crusts.  Proper Brick Oven was a very nice dining experience and a place that I must remember to try again in the future.",

There are not multiple sizes so I'm not sure how an individual tackles this. I believe it was called Cornerboard and was adorned with pork belly, pepperoni and sausage.

    "text": "I visited on a Sunday evening during a Steeler game, the place was semi full but in no way packed. I will start by saying this place would receive 5 stars if it was solely based on service alone. Our server, Allen (if I recall correctly), was helpful in explaining items on the menu and really made us feel welcome.   I was in a party of five (lol) there celebrating a birthday, it was the first trip to Proper for all of us. We started with the house chips and French dip. They made for a great start to a meal unfortunately the rest of the meal didn't live up the appetizer.   I ordered the Margherita pizza, others ordered the pesto pasta and pesto pizza. I wasn't too pleased with the pizza. Honestly for $15 I expected something more filling and satisfying. The pizza itself was burnt, now I know it's brick oven pizza but it lacked flavor. The middle of the pizza itself was very soggy and once it cooled it tasted half cooked. Not sure if the oven was up too high or too many pizzas were placed in the oven causing it to be cooked unequally.   A friend who ordered the pesto pasta wasn't happy with her meal either, it was too oily and not what she expected. Those who got the pesto pizza however were very happy with their choice.   The bathroom was a mess with toilet paper and paper towels covering the floor. I bet this was the cause of Steeler fans eating prior to the game but we didn't arrive until after half time so that's more than enough time to clean up.   Between the less than stellar food and messy bathroom this place gets three starts from me. I would consider coming back on the service alone but will definitely order something besides the pizza.",

They came with an onion sauce that was good but very similar to the onion packets you mix with sour cream.  The beer was regularly priced but not sure the glasses were a full pint.  We then got the beet salad which included what they called vinaigrette dressing but they might as well call it vinegar dressing.  I will say the goat cheese balls were delicious that came with the salad.  Our family is a big fan of stone brick oven pizza and that is why we choose this place in the first place when visiting from out of town.   I unfortunately would put this pizza at the bottom of our list for stone oven pizzas.  I will wish the owners good luck since they were extremely nice but we will not come back given that we feel there was not enough value for the cost.",

We ordered and my food came out promptly. I'd say for brick oven the pizza came out a lot quicker than I expected. My waiter was super diligent in refilling my drink. I got three cokes in less than 45 mins! Usually I need to beg waiters to refill my glass. Pizza is overpriced at $16 for a pie, but hey. It's new it's hip its the thing to do! Great date place or business meeting. I wouldn't come here regularly but once in a blue moon I wouldn't mind one of their pizza pies!",

The Margherita was good a, but the Black and Gold was phenomenal.   It had Yukon Gold potatoes and golden beets on it....two things I had never had on a pizza....great combo.   Service was great. We were seated right away. Always had our drinks refilled without asking and they split the check for us.  Overall, wonderful experience and we will be back for sure!

    "text": "I had a nice dinner here before a show in town.  We sat at the bar because all the tables left were marked for larger groups, but  I like sitting at the bar, so that was quiet alright.  The menu isn't big, but it's focused.  You're coming here and you know you'll have pizzas, pastas, and maybe a few salads and that's all they need.  The pasta with simple tomato sauce was flavorful and I enjoyed it.  It got a little one-note halfway through; I would have liked more fresh herbs to add some brightness throughout the whole meal.  The bartenders were friendly and fairly attentive for the most part, though they didn't seem very busy just yet, so they should have been keeping an eye on us.  The only odd part was one of the staff members sitting at the bar eating.  I couldn't tell if he was on the clock or off, but I was a little confused because he seemed like he had some managerial position.  Other staff members were coming to him and asking questions, sampling new beers he told them were just brought in, and generally interacting with him while he sat and ate a pizza.  He wasn't being crass or loud, I just wasn't sure if he was being entirely professional.  All in all, I had a great night.  If you're torn between a draft or a cocktail, I'd go with a cocktail.  It seemed like a better value.  Most of the beers were between $5.75 and $7 and anything over 7% ABV (as most of the higher-priced beers were) were served in 12 oz glasses and the Lemoncello Collins my boyfriend ordered was $10 (and full size).  I'd pay 3 more for that.",

In addition, when my friend's pasta came out, she had to decline, for it looked like maggots. Also, my other friend's clams had a horrific stench. They both sent back their meals, and only one got a new meal. On our friend's bill, they only took of a beer. The tables were very close, so we could hear everyone's conversations.

    "text": "Pizza and craft beer are two of my absolute favorite things. Knowing this, my boyfriend scored major brownie points by choosing Proper as the location for my surprise birthday dinner. We arrived in the middle of the pre-show rush crowd (it's located in the heart of the Cultural District), so we found room to sit at the bar while we waited for a table, but just decided to eat there instead. After all, we had a very friendly bartender at our beck and call who was happily allowing us to sample any of the 30 drafts that we wanted and we could watch the Pens game right in front of us. Plus, we probably got even faster service that way.  I really like the atmosphere of this place. Casual yet sophisticated. Modern yet a bit retro (mason jar hanging lights, for example). Overall, just very comfortable and not at all pretentious. After all, it's basically an upscale pizza and beer (and I guess wine) place. There are a few TV's at the bar, but nothing that would distract you while you were dining at a nearby table. And they kept their own music playing the whole time, even during the Pens game, which was awesome because I feel like it could've been a playlist made up from my very own collection.  We decided to order two pizzas so we could share both of them, knowing full well that we would probably have an entire pizza left over. (Leftover pizza is never a bad thing, in my opinion.) We went with the Bianca and the Mediterranean, which were both delicious. I prefer my crust more on the soft and chewy side, which is often hard to do when cooking a pizza in a wood fired oven, but both pizzas came out perfectly done. Not undercooked at all, but not an overwhelming amount of char. Simply delicious. The only other thing we had were some house-made potato chips as an appetizer, which were decent, but not the best I've ever had. I'm looking forward to trying the black pepper bacon candy the next time I eat there.  I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this place. Since their menu is slated to change seasonally, I can't wait to go back and try some new things, even though there were already several things on the menu this time around that I just didn't have the room/time to try. And I just might have to try scoring a warm and cozy seat at the pizza bar in front of the oven this winter!",

    "text": "This was my first time at Proper. The layout is a little weird, You don't get much privacy but anyways when I first sat down I kept feeling water droplets drip onto me and I realized it was the air conditioning above me. I told the waiter about it but said it was no big, and i moved to another seat at our table. He felt so bad that he climbed up on the booth and was wiping it down. I thought that was really nice. Onto the food. My party ordered the pepperoni roll and the chips/onion dip as an app. Both were good. We then shared the Forest pizza. This was recommended by the waiter because we couldn't decide. It was delicious. All the ingredients were fresh. We even kept the last of the onion dip to dip our pizza crust in. All in all a great little spot. I will deff be back.   P.S Our waiter was Kyle and he was amazing :)",

    "text": "While wandering through Pittsburgh along the Allegheny River, I pulled up Yelp to find a pizza place nearby, and I was lucky enough to be very close to Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room in the heart of downtown.  This restaurant is less than a year old, but the good users of Yelp who had already eaten there definitely steered me in the right direction with their positive reviews.  When I walked in I was greeted by the warmth of the beautiful, working wood-fire pizza oven and cozy tables.   I was impressed as soon as I saw their beer list, which had a lot of seasonal variety, and it continued when I tried their house-made potato chips.  The soft chips were pretty good, and I really liked the dip they were served with.  I don't always get too into dip, but its mixture of onion, chive, and garlic was quite delicious.  My wife and I each ordered our own pizza as they come in a personal size at Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room.  Mine was the carnivore and her's was the margherita, and, after sampling each other's, we both agreed that the carnivore is the way to go.  The meat was savory and fresh and really took the pizza to another level.  Still, both pizzas had a nice soft and airy crust with a slight glaze that I believe was olive oil.  I also really enjoyed the flavorful sauce at Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room.  The cheese was probably my least favorite part as it was a creamy-type of mozzarella that was almost nearing a ricotta-type of texture, but it is just my personal preference that is against that kind of cheese texture.  It worked out well for me that there wasn't a lot of cheese on the pizza as I preferred the taste of the crust, sauce, and toppings.  Overall, I am extremely happy that I stumbled upon the Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room and would recommend it to anyone in Pittsburgh.",

Waitress seemed clueless throughout.   Bad drinks, good but overpriced food, spotty service. There are better spots for gourmet pizza on this town.",

The cocktail, wine and beer menus are extensive.  I opted for the Rhuberry Lemonade, rhubard flavored vodka, lemonade and muddled raspberries...very tasty and refreshing.   Our group of 20 sat at 2 separate tables of 10.   Both tables ordered the housemade potato chips with homemade french onion dip (yum).  We also ordered 3 salads which were adequate to share among 10 people.  We ordered the BLT, House and an Arugula salad.   Each was fresh, nicely dressed and tasty.   Collectively we ordered the Margherita, Meditteranean, Bianca, and the Carnivore.  Each pizza was tasty in it's own rite.   The crust was perfect, not too thick, not too thin with the right amount of crunch.  The toppings were fresh and generous.   A co-worker and I split the butterscotch bread pudding, it was served warm and delicious ( I wish that I had ordered one just for myself, it was pretty good).  I would definitely return to Proper Brick Oven when visiting Pittsburgh.",

My parents are simple eaters and when we walked in we were surprised to find that it was more gourmet food than we expected. We looked over the menu and figured we would just share a pizza and order salads. Our waiter came over and was very nice! He explained the menu and offered alterations to our meal (Margaretta pizza add pepperoni) and catered to our individual requests. He explained the beer menu very well to my mom and offered her samples because she was unsure. To top off our superior service, the food was incredible! They make their own mozzarella in house, you could taste just how incredibly fresh all the ingredients were, our salads (house and BLT) pizza (see above) and dessert (peaches and cream trifecta and cheese cake trio) were to die for!!! If we ever come back to Pittsburgh, we will definitely be returning to Proper!!! :)",

We shared the chips app and the bianca pizza with prosciutto added. Delicious.  The chips were nicely salted and crunchy with a French onion style dipping sauce.  The pizza was the star. We ordered it slightly well done, just to get the edges of the crust almost charred. Perfection.  We also ordered drinks that were very nicely prepared. The old fashioned wasn't bad, but I'm snobbish about those so it has to be special to get me excited. My wife had a cherry blossom rum based drink. She enjoyed it.   Tips: We sat at the pizza bar and got to watch them make pizzas. Neat, but got warm.  The staff is very friendly.  Kudos to the manager who told the drunk folks who walked in and sat beside us that they could not be served any alcohol. They came in drunk, and the restaurant was very responsible and handled the situation like professionals.",

I called Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room and they said it wouldn't be a problem to get us a table for two at 5:30. We arrived and were behind this older couple that were taking forever. We stood there for at least 10 minutes waiting on this couple to figure whatever it was they needed. When we finally got to the podium the hostess that I spoke to earlier that day now said it would be an hour wait. We went to the bar but that older couple had gone up and claimed all 8 seats available.   We left and had a great dinner at City Works. We definitely will never return to Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room. How are two people allowed to claim 8 seats at the bar when only two are present? The bartender said \"first come, first serve\". Well, we were there and the other six of their party weren't. So apparently their little motto doesn't actually apply.   Never to return.",

She took all our information and food came out in a timely fashion. Nothing was rushed but we also did not have long waits for anything. We also had leftovers that she promptly, neatly boxed up. The manager also made it a point to stop by every table and ask about the food and service. You can tell they really care about the diners having a great experience. 6:30pm on a Saturday night the place was packed!   DRINKS: Maple Old Fashioned - very strong drink, husband was impressed Gluten Free Beer - amazing they serve it for our gluten free diner Homemade Mocktail - this was iced tea, lemonade, black berry, and mint. The syrups here are made in-house. Refreshing! As a non-alcohol drinker, I was excited to have a fun drink that was delicious but not soda or plain water or plain iced tea!   APPS: House-made Chips and Dip: This is just $4. It's the perfect beginning to any meal. As a person who always chooses House-made Chips over fries and loves onion dip, this is great! It's like artisan chips and dip!  Forest Pizza: Mushrooms are plentiful and flavorful. Chewy crust. Perfect to share as an app if eating with a group. The fresh Parmesan and chili flakes help add to the deliciousness!   ENTREES: Scallops Risotto - the scallops are perfectly seared. The cream and cheesiness makes for a yummy rich combo. The description of this entree says kale. I was afraid this would be too much kale or like sauteed spinach. However, I was pleasantly surprised that this was crispy fried bits of goodness! It did not mess up the richness of the entree. It was little sprinkles of salty kale chip essence that also gave the dish a pop of color.  Bolognese - homemade pappardelle pasta. Flavorful meaty sauce. My husband practically licked the plate. Well-portioned. This dish comes with bread he said was delicious and loved using it to clean the plate of the sauce.   Carbonara - homemade fettuccine pasta. I can't get over the deliciousness of the homemade pasta. The creamy pancetta was paired perfectly with the al dente pasta.  Apple-Sage Sausage And Polenta Special - This is a special. It may not be there when you go there. Specials are changed often and it seems the menu changes almost every two weeks. It's great to always be able to try new entrees. The sausage is homemade and the polenta is very creamy.   All the entrees were amazing and we would order all of them again. I love that everything is homemade. Presentation and portions are also well done.  DESSERT: S'mores parfait - toasted marshmallow, chocolate custard, graham cracker crumbs. The toasted marshmallow is beautiful and I loved toasted marshmallow. It mixed well with a spoon of chocolate and graham cracker. The combo of all 3 flavors is perfect. Unfortunately, there is just one layer of marshmallow and two of chocolate and graham cracker. While delicious, I wish there was more marshmallow.   My sister lives in the city which is why I was here. Apparently, this was her third time here in a month!!!! I can definitely see why she comes here. It's her favorite restaurant in the city. Everything tonight was delicious and we will definitely return. If you take anything away from this review please know this... yes the pizza is delicious but there is also so much more than just pizza.",

Only complaint is the risotto was a bit salty, but if you eat all the bits at once, it wasn't a major issue and I ate it all up :)  Restaurant itself is really nice and cozy.

I've been here a few times and I have to say that it's one of my favorite cultural district spots. The pizzas are delicious and can be served up quickly. My favorite so far is the Black and Gold. I also really enjoy the Free Birds appetizer that comes with two grilled chicken sliders, three full sized chicken wings, and this delicious blackberry bbq sauce that is sweet and spicy and I always just end up eating it with a spoon like a real classy lady.   My only complaint is the lay-out. The bar takes up a lot of the space and there's only a tiny walkway to get to the back of the restaurant. I hate sitting at the tables that line that tiny little walkway because you end up getting bumped all night.   If you plan on visiting on a night when there is a show at the Benedum, allow yourself lots of time. Service is quick once you're seated, but expect a wait to get a table. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more.",

She was able to recommend food items and tell me how she felt about various wines. She was excellent about timely and accurate service, and very personable!  My boyfriend got the \"Forest\" pizza, a mushroom specialty with fontina cheese. He ate the entire pie!  I got the Margherita pizza, and I loved it. It was a bit saucier than what I'm used to, but a welcome change. Kali provided us with fresh black and red pepper, and fresh grated parmesan cheese.   Next time, I plan to try the pesto pizza.

With 30 taps on the wall, the selection here is outstanding offering a mix of local brews and craft favorites.  I went with a Draai Laag Goedenacht (Belgian styled ale) and I couldn't have made a better choice!  It's delicious; just what I was in the mood for.   And speaking of delicious, the pizza and pastas here a terrific too.  This is one of my \"go to\" spots to meet up for dinner with friends or a date prior to a show or ball game.  I usually get the carnivor pizza. In my opinion it's the best pie in the Burgh.   The Brick Oven Proper and Tap Room is  an easy five stars.",

If you want, you can sit at the bar, watch the pizzas get made, and see them bake in the 800 degree oven! I was worried about it being hot, but it's really not at all.   Service: our server was so lovely. She always had a smile and was ready to chat. Plus, she came back at very appropriate times to check on us. I feel like at least three different people asked how our food was, so they're clearly pretty attentive to any potential problems.   Food: YES. AMAZING. Maybe I'm a little biased because I got to see my pizza baby go from dough ball to full-grown meal, but I thoroughly enjoyed what I got. Between the two of us, we had an order of bacon candy, a tacchino sandwich, a carnivore pizza, and a forest pizza. All were great. Try not to get addicted to the bacon candy.   Can't wait to be back, and maybe we'll try some dessert next time too! :)",

DELICIOUS.  I had the pesto pizza ... it was good but a little too much oil.  The chicken with rainbow chard was very good.  The featured fish came out on a huge plate and looked like the chef forgot to add the potato or vegetables based on the amount of white space on the plate.  The other meals were on appropriate size dishes.  The fish was good although small portion.  The red cake was beautiful, moist, & definitely share-able.  Didn't have room but want to go back to try the mushroom bisque.  They take reservations for parties of more than six people.",

Chewy, crunchy, slightly blackened on the edges.  All in all delicious, albeit a bit too blackened in some spots.   M had the bianca which was your traditional white pizza but with homemade ricotta.  Delicious!  I will definitely be returning to try the desserts and the awesome drink menu.",

At this point, I think I have had every pizza on the menu and my two favorites are the Carnivore Pizza and the Ocean Pizza + Bacon (you can add bacon to any pizza!). The pizza's are thin-crust and cooked in a wood-fired pizza oven which gives the crust a great bake and crunch around the outside. The portions are individually sized, and some people will finish while others will have extra.   The best appetizer they have is the Bacon Candy. It is thick cut bacon that is caramelized with brown sugar. While there have been a few nights when it has been subpar, in general it was a perfect mix of crispy, chewy, salty and sweet. The only nights we didn't order it, were those when they had run out.  They also have a chalk board behind the bar with broad selection of beers on tap which change on a regular basis.",

We stopped in last weekend during that odd time between lunch and dinner - so they weren't serving their whole menu.  We had a couple of drinks and chatted for awhile with a guy who I'm assuming is the manager.  It's so good to see that something worthwhile has finally replaced the old and run down Tambellini's.  While we weren't able to try a pizza, we did try their homemade chips and onion dip - YUM!  I'm a sucker for homemade chips, but these were particularly tasty.  Crispy and perfectly salty - it was a great compliment to the cool and creamy housemade onion dip.  I can't wait to go back and try out some of their pizzas.",

    "text": "So, I went yesterday with the same group of people. Proper was packed! I believe we got one of the last tables in the place. Here's the breakdown of the update.  Service: 2.5/5. It took our server about ten minutes to acknowledge us. The hostess got us our drinks after we had been waiting for a while, which was nice of her. Our server spoke to us maybe three times the whole evening. I really felt like I was bothering her by asking her for things (apps came without plates, refills on drinks after they sat empty for a while.) She wasn't bad, but I've had better.  Food: 4/5. The Bacon Candy: It didn't taste anything like the first time. Instead of a savory mix between sweet, spicy, smoky, and salty...all I could taste was a bad mix of salt and spice. It didn't have the sweet, maple-like taste like the first time, but it was overwhelmingly salty and had a serious kick to it. It also tasted...underdone. Not sure of a better way to describe it. It didn't have a crisp bite to it, but it reminded me of bacon that needed to be cooked for a few minutes longer.  Proper House Chips and Dip: It was pretty good. It's an adult version of Lays and Lipton French Onion Dip and we enjoyed it. It was the perfect amount of chips v. dip as well. The only thing I would've done differently was salt the chips before they came out; the dip seemed like it was missing something, but a dash of salt brought it out. It was very good.  Funghi: Once again...fantastic. Can't say anything bad about it.  Bacon and Broccoli Pasta: It was good. It was spicy...I think someone had a thing for Pepper that night as everything tasted heavy on the Pepper. It wasn't a bad thing as it still tasted very good, but very heavy on the pepper.  Carbonara: It was awesome! Very tasty and very well done. Once again...heavy on the pepper, but still very tasty.  Dessert: They were okay: Cheesecake, Chocolate Cake, and the frozen custard. They were all good...nothing too standout, but it was still good and we were all happy.  Ambience: 2/5. It was extremely loud in the dining room. Since it's so small inside, it's not hard to see why it would sound loud, but I felt like I had to almost shout to my table mates. It didn't help that there was an obnoxiously loud, drunk guy at the bar and he stood right behind us the entire time we were there along with a large party. The other thing...it was very dark. I don't remember it being so dark inside the first time, but one of my tablemates had to use his flashlight on his cellphone to read the menu as his eyesight isn't the best.  Overall...it wasn't a bad trip, but I learned to steer clear of the place if it even looks busy. I will be going again as their Microbrew selection is awesome and the bartender makes incredible cocktails and one mediocre trip isn't enough to keep me from going back.",

As soon as you walk in you see the brick oven.  This was enough to make me order the pizza.  I ordered the margherita pizza but was underwhelmed by the flavor.  I think it was the sauce that was lackluster, but it was hot and fresh and had basil on it - I LUUUUV basil.  I still think Il Pizzaiolo makes the best thin crust pizza in this town and the secret is in their sauce so anywhere I go I always compare the pizza to Il Pizz.    For drinks, I decided to go with a glass of the Greystone Cab (I think it was on a happy hour special) and then I got the Sage Suzanne which was refreshing and citrusy.    I shared the flourless chocolate cake with another individual in our group and it was too much and too rich for us to finish.  I wouldn't necessarily call it a \"cake\" either as it tasted more like fudge paired with some cinnamon whipped cream and drizzled with some citrus sauce.  I probably wouldn't order this again, but it was decent.    I'd definitely go back again to try some other items on their menu and their other drinks.",

    "text": "I can't say that I'm impressed in anyway with this restaurant.  I arrived slightly after the rest of my group, but after sitting it took the waiter three trips before he even asked for my drink order.  It's not like the place was that busy as it had only been one hour since opening.  I ordered the Bloody Proper.  This was probably the worst Bloody Mary I have ever had.  It was very sweet, tasted too strong of vodka and it had little to no spice/heat to it.  I didn't even finish it.  I got the carnivore pizza and was expecting to be impressed as this is a pizza place.  Sadly it was lackluster at best.  It was very greasy and when picked up everything slid right off the crust.  I would have sent it back for further baking; however, the crust edges were already so chard that it would have been like eating charcoal if I had it cooked longer.  I will say it that the flavor was palatable once you got past the grease.  The pizza was only big enough for one hungry person so if going out with some one else expect to shell out $15+ for each pizza.  I then got a beer that was not as cold as would be expected.  The original beer that I wanted they did not have, and the beer selection was not all that impressive considering it is a \"Tap House\".  Overall,  the bill came to $40+, which for me is not bad (I don't mind spending decent money when the food is exquisite and the service impeccable); however, for greasy pizza, bad drinks and poor service.  Very unimpressed and will not be back.",

This restaurant is in downtown Pittsburgh and the day we visited this place it was soooo cold and after parking we walked about 3 blocks to get there. Annnyway it's a lovely shindig. Very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. It feels like you're walking into someone's home. :) Well we ordered the meat pizza and I had a drink called reindeer tracks in the snow. It was fabulous! Very posh. He sampled a few beers. We also enjoyed the candy bacon!!!  Sooooo yummy. The food was delicious the waitstaff was so friendly he kept talking to us about New Orleans (oh how we miss home). Overall nice place..yummy food.",

The menu has a lot of enticing selections, but both times I opted for the wood-fired pizzas.  Fancy pizzas equal fancy prices here, but although it can be pricey, I felt like I got a good value for my money.  The Carnivore Pizza was satisfying for my healthy appetite -- very meaty with a very good crust and sauce.  We also ordered the Potato chips appetizer.  The portion size was small but the taste was good and I especially liked the dip that came with the chips.  The atmosphere in this restaurant is relaxed but sophisticated.  The service was very attentive and genuine, and my only complaint is that our pizzas took a long time to come out, but they were slammed with pizza orders all at the time I was there.  I forgave them, and they actually comped our drinks which was nice.  I had a nice time at this restaurant and will hope to return.",

The pizza was okay if you were going there to drink for 2-3 hours, watch a couple of games and then got hungry and had to eat something. Do not go just for the pizza.   We stayed at the William Penn and googled best pizza in pitt. There were enough good reviews to warrant a visit and I was thirsty!! The bar must be set very low for good pizza in Pittsburgh. The two stars were for the beer selection only. We tried the bacon candy. Overcooked bacon with brown sugar? My daughter was impressed, me so-so. I always order the Margherita pie on my first visit to any pizza joint. That way you can taste the sauce, cheese and crust without meat and other flavoring interfering. This is chain restaurant pizza a best. Then came dessert, ugh! My daughter always gets dessert when I treat her to dinner. Triple layered chocolate cake with peanut butter filling I think? We got two forks so I dove in. The cake must have been baked last week. You couldn't stick a fork in it!! The cake would crumble and it got harder deeper into the cake. No wonder they buried it under peanut butter, chocolate syrup and some crunchy something or other. A third of the way through my daughter bit into a piece of plastic wrap.   Our server came over, apologized, removed the cake from the table and the charge off our bill. He also bought me one of my beers. Once is enough.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Proper before seeing Wicked at the Benedum. We were lucky enough to go during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week, so they were offering a special of one appetizer,one pizza, and one dessert from a selected menu. The appetizers were delicious. Bacon Candy was great , as well as the Pepperoni Bread (I believe it was called Pepperoni Pagnotta or something to that effect). The pizzas were top-notch as well. I really wanted a Carnivore, but since it was not part of the special, I chose a pie that had , among other toppings, goat cheese and house cured sweet sausage. My wife had a pizza with spinach and bacon, Both were great. The Peanut Butter Cheesecake and the Turtle Brownie sundae for dessert were also very good. The only issue that we had, and through no fault of the restaurant, is that we began to run short on time, since the show was to begin in about 30 minutes, and we had just finished our appetizers...we did have about a 45 minute to one hour wait to be seated...the place is on the small side. We told our waitress of our time constraint, and she actually helped move things along as quickly as possible (brought dessert and check shortly after the pizzas arrived,as we requested, and got our payment processed and leftovers boxed very quickly!) She was even kind enough to label our bag of leftover pizza with our name and hold it until we stopped in to get it after the show! The beer selection looked impressive, although I am not a real craft beer drinker. I just can't enjoy a beer that is $8 or $9 for a 12 oz pour...that said, it appeared that the selection was quite varied and looked tasty. Again, not an indictment of the restaurant, just a personal preference (I'd rather drink three 23 oz domestic drafts at a local bar for the same price!). All in all, I highly recommend this place and would dine here again ay any opportunity!",

We were a party of 7 (two separate groups of friends) and 5 of us originally got cocktails to which none of us like and we all switched to a beer. Or at least the three of us in the back corner would have liked to do except the server never asked use. Don't get us wrong, she was at our table a couple of times but was only talking to the four that were close to us. We literally had to yell at her to just get water she was already passing out to the other four. Portions were on the smaller side but that didn't bother me much. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. My salad was just ok, my husbands pasta dish didn't have much flavor, and our friend said her pizza tasted just like pizza, nothing special.

We ordered some mussels to share and they were very good...not the best....but very fresh and the broth was tasty. They actually seated us in about 25 minutes. I asked the waitress for suggestions and she recommended the Ocean pizza....it was an outstanding seafood style pizza...white style with a very tender crust. The pizzas a bit large for a personal....but with a salad I would split one. My husband had the carnivore....he loved it, especially the plentiful toppings. My one friend has shrimp wrapped in prosciutto with a grilled root salad...she said it was delicious. Her husband asked them if they could whip up spaghetti with meatballs in a red sauce....and they did!!! In his defense, we were contemplating an Italian restaurant before going here.

    "text": "The first time I visited Proper was last year sometime shortly after they opened.  My husband and I went after work one night and had a couple of drinks and a margherita pizza.  The pizza was very good.  However, the price was $14.  If I'm going to spend $14 on a plain pizza, I'm going to Il Pizzaiolo where a plain is $14 and out of this world.  Proper's pizza was good, but definitely not out of this world.  We were there again yesterday for lunch by accident.  It was my husband's birthday and we were not able to get into our first choice restaurant, so opted for this place since it was nearby and very cold outside.  We were seated promptly to a not very crowded dining room.  I ordered a water, minestrone soup, and Mediterranean pizza.  My husband ordered an iced tea, side salad, and Tacchino sandwich.  He had trouble pronouncing the name of the sandwich and the server helped him, but thought he was talking about the Finocchio pizza, so consequently brought him the wrong meal - a pizza instead of a sandwich.  We had waited a good bit for the food to come out and even though the waitress offered to have his original choice made for him, he opted to just keep the pizza, as we were on our lunch hour and really didn't have the time to wait for something else.  She said she would be happy to discount our bill.  Okay, great.  However, when the bill came, she removed his iced tea and the minestrone soup only.  Really?  The sandwich would have been $10, the pizza was $16.  You bring us an incorrect entree and only discount the bill approx. $7 (soup $5 and iced tea, maybe $2 equals $7)?  This could have been the manager's call, but still.  Why are we paying for your mistakes?  Again, Il Pizzaiolo has WAY better pizza and the prices are comparable.  I just don't see what the fuss is all about here.  Yes, the food is good.  But, I feel like I'm being gouged on price.  It's just not worth it.",

    "text": "We went here to celebrate my brother's birthday a few weeks ago. My husband and I had been wanting to try it for a few months and were really excited to finally have a reason to. The food was excellent. The three of us split two pizzas (I think they were around 12in pies? We ordered the margherita and the carnivore pizzas) and we loved them. We got the bacon candy as an appetizer. I'm not a big fan of bacon, but I thought it was okay and the guys ate the whole plate in about 10 minutes, so if you like bacon, I'd say you'd probably like it. I didn't try any beer because I'm pregnant, but both my husband and my brother said the beer was great too. We also had a very good server, who was able to find a nice balance between being attentive and not hovering over us the entire night.   My only problems with the restaurant were that it was extremely crowded and the menu was a bit pricey. It's a very small restaurant, but they really cram as many people in as they can. I felt like we were eating on top of the tables next to us, and it was difficult to get out of the restaurant because there was so little space to walk between the bar and the tables. Because the restaurant was so crowded, it was very noisy and I sometimes felt like I had to almost shout to be heard. We were repeating ourselves a lot as a result. The prices weren't terrible, given how good the food was, but I did feel like the portion sizes weren't quite big enough to justify how expensive everything was.   Overall, I'd go here again, but only for special occasions with my husband, and next time we'll definitely be sure to make a reservation.",

Their beer selection is almost overwhelming...many, many unique brews, and the list is always changing.  Most beers I had never heard of, and the ones I tried were all very tasty (they have a nice selection of IPAs, as well as lighter beers with a tint of fruit).  I think my favorite IPA has been the Last Chance.  I haven't tried the pizzas (yet), but the Bacon Candy, chips with the homemade french onion dip, herb & onion focaccia, and the roasted peppers are all VERY good.    Worth a visit.  The two times I was there, it was easy to get seated (once at a table with three of us, the next time at the bar).  Also a good spot to watch a game as they have a few large screen TVs.",

Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room came up in my searches consistently, among a few others, so I checked out the menus, prices, locations, and reviews.  Ultimately, I ended up going to Proper, because the menu appealed to me.    It definitely lived up to my expectations.  The food was excellent.  I had the house salad (split with my dining partner), and we shared the Black & Gold pizza, which was surprisingly delicious (surprising because I was a little skeptical at first about having potatoes and beets on my pizza).  The service was great, and the ambiance was exactly what I needed:  not too loud or boisterous but lively enough to feel like the place can draw fans.  I'm not a beer drinker, but they seemed to have an extensive list of beers, and the wine offerings and other cocktails seemed appealing too.  I had a chardonnay that I liked very much.  I recommend Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room for those who like pizza but want variety and are looking for a gourmet touch.",

Don't even plan on sharing these; the little cone they pretend is for the table won't be enough for you--they're that good.  I'm a traditionalist and keep with a fire oven toasty pizza each time, usually the bianca (hello, ricotta & roasted pepper!).  If I can fit in a salad, it's always worth it. Butter lettuce!They are beyond for salads. +1 has to get the lamb sliders. As a non-lamb eater myself I'll have to take his word on the juicy little guys that he can't get enough of. It's a shame we're so set in the incredible items we've found because the menu is extensive! Pasta, pizza, meats, salads, bizarre seasonal items like cold cucumber soup and I don't even know what else. The cocktail list is great too which holds this place in very high standings with me. Drinks I've never seen before, a great wine list, and while I'm not a beer kind of gal, they have tons of taps.  I love to sit on the lower front sections, although it can get a little loud by the bar and pizza oven, there are a few TV's, and even a high top overlooking said oven (great in December, coming in from subzero downtown!). I remember when this was Tambellini's. Old school Pittsburgh family Italian after a show at the Benedum has been updated perfectly to a light, cozy spot to grab something after an impromptu trip to the (relatively newly revamped) tiny cultural district.",

    "text": "The only thing that could supersede this wonderful dinner was our server, Kyle, so let me start with him.  He was flawless!  He greeted us, introduced himself and told us about Happy Hour, making suggestions for our drinks.  He helped us out with our orders and followed our instructions to a tee (the usual for the lady: \"dressing on the side, no onion, etc.!\")  Our salads and drinks were served promptly and then our pizza arrived right on time.  Kyle appeared immediately with fresh parmesan for our pizzas!  Kyle is the quintessential server - he is there for you to take care of all your needs, but he is polite and low key, and doesn't talk your ear off!  The salad was epic (the new \"Root\" salad with beets, goat cheese, etc.) - so much so, that I was worried about getting through my pizza.  Not so for my husband, who inhaled his BLT salad AND enjoyed the carnivore pizza!  He was in heaven, as was I with my Bianca pizza!  Kyle made sure that I had no garlic oil and had the chef use plain olive oil for me, per my request.  The pizzas were fantastic, as were the salads!    You must go to Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room and if you want the perfect night, request Kyle.  He is a professional and an incredible server!",

Tried their seasonal pumpkin pizza and mmm, it was perfectly woodfired. Expertly seasoned and the crust was nice and crispy like you'd expect from any woodfired pizza. Pretty extensive drink selection, too. Beers and cider on tap from local places and mainstream favorites. Wine and cocktails that were well made.   Everyone from the hostess to bartenders to servers went out of their way to be friendly and accommodating. Can't wait to come back! Have heard the place is great for groups, too.",

    "text": "I've visited Proper yesterday with a large work group. My overall experience was A-Ok.  The special sauce of this restaurant is obviously its pizza. Not the biggest fan of pizza and wasn't in the mood for it. Instead, I chose to order one of their pasta dishes (Gamberetto). So felt like I played in part in not getting the best experience. I wasn't impressed by the Gamberetto dish. The flavors that I thought would be jumping out of it fell completely flat. The jumbo shrimp were overcooked and chewy. I could barely discern the flavor of garlic. The veggies (asparagus and spinach) were overcooked. I had to salt my dish a few times, something that I very rarely do.  I was kind of surprised by all of this because the apps we ordered were more solid. The prosciutto wrapped shrimp on top of wilted spinach was very flavorful as was the broth that came with the beer mussels.  I have to say that our server was on top of his game and made the night enjoyable. When he walked over to take our order, I could see a look of confusion on his face because we had not received any menus when we were seated by the hostess. He took care of that like stat! We were almost 10 in our group and while she gave us all dinner menus, she only left two drink menus, but our server quickly took care of that as well. He made the evening run smoothly. And for that reason, I will try Proper again, but ordering pizza next time!",

    "text": "I have to admit, I really enjoyed my time here.  As soon as you walk in, you just smell the wood fire pizza.  For me, this is the scent Yankee Candle needs to make, than again that might be a bad idea because I would be ordering pizza for every meal.  Ok, back to reality.  I opened the door and the smell hits you right away.  The bar is not too bright not too dark, just right.  Gives it a relaxed, quiet yet upscale feel, without being upscale and snotty.    The bar area is extremely long, plenty of seating around the elongated horseshoe bar.  There are some tables in and around the large bar area as well.  What do I love about here?  The support of local beer and PA beers in general.  Lots of players from around the area, Grist House, Voodoo, East End, Rivertowne, Hop Farm, Helltown.  Statewide, you have Shawnee Brewing, Yards, Victory.  They also have a good amount of Great Lakes and some West Coast brews (Ballast Point).  Many of the brews they have on tap fit in with the season, Belgian Wits, American Wheats, Hefeweizens, Session ales (though they are not below 4%, so in my mind, not technically session, but still low alcohol).   A nice menu of food.  Please try the Bacon Candy if you are someone who likes bacon.  The brown sugar glaze on it was fantastic, not over done.  I could eat this as a meal.  We also had the Margherita pizza.  Not the largest of pizza's, but the crust was extra crunchy on the outside, yet chewy on the inside....yeah, good stuff.  Staff here is knowledgable, friendly, fast and efficient.    Huge fan and I will be back, there are plenty of great beers and pizzas that I 'need' to have!",

    "text": "What a gem! We had just one night in Pittsburgh so I chose this place based on Yelp reviews. So glad I did!   The restaurant is in a stand alone building on the corner. Half of the building is covered in vines. The facade is immediately inviting.  Inside, the seating area is long and narrow. You can sit right in front of the pizza oven, along the bar, at family style high tops in the back, or at a booth. We sat at a booth in front of the bar and I would recommend requesting this area if you can.  The waitress was knowledgeable and friendly. She explained that they make as much as possible from scratch using the freshest ingredients. Based on Yelp reviews, we ordered the Forest and Pesto pizzas. Two smalls were plenty for the two of us. The dough is handmade and hand tossed and it shows. Wow, it's amazing! Soft and chewy. The toppings pack a flavorful punch. The Forest was our favorite. Delicious! $17 each.  I also ordered the chips (handmade) and could have done without them. They are good, but I had more than enough to eat without them! $4.  My mom ordered a bottle of wine. The waitress was happy to give her a taste of an open bottle first to make sure she liked it. I ordered a flight of four beers for $10. They had a great selection of wheats, ales, IPAs and stouts all on draft. There were several beers from San Diego and just as we were about to leave, they put a new beer on the board: habanero Sculpin from Ballast Point! No way - that's my favorite!! Of course I had to stay for a pint. #vacation  Insider Tip: the theater parking across the street is worth it for $9 flat rate. Other lots are more expensive. Otherwise there is street parking with a two hour limit.",

It was relatively empty when we arrived and were seated immediately.  Our server, overall, was fantastic. It seemed like he was managing every table of customers with how often he walked up and down the bar and asked how people were doing, but was extremely attentive to us as we dined. Not being particularly hungry, my boyfriend and I ordered a Carnivore Pizza and the Proper House Salad. The salad was good, but the lettuce and apples were slightly watery. The pizza was okay as well. The toppings were not as flavorful as expected, but it got the job done.  Looking around the dining room, it was very nicely decorated and did appear as though they had an excellent beer selection! We overheard another server telling their table that the manager hand draws the chalk signs for the brews.",

    "text": "I just went there the other night for dinner. The decor of the restaurant is awesome. I really loved the light fixtures. The size of the restaurant is very small. There is limited seating for dinner but there must be about twenty seats around the bar.   Our party started with their signature Proper Snack - Bacon Candy. The bacon used is smoked and cured in-house. The Bacon Candy was really good. It has a brown sugar glaze and black pepper crust. This gave the pork belly an initial sweet taste with a kick. I have never had bacon prepared that way. For my entree, I got the Forest pizza. The Forest comes with caramelized wild mushrooms, roasted shallot, balsamic reduction, fresh thyme and fontina. It was a really good pizza. Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room cooks their pizzas in an 800 degree oven. They serve their pizzas as soon as their come out. My only complaint is the crust. When I think of brick oven pizza, I really want a nice crispy crust. I think the thickness of the crust prevents the pizza from getting a really crispy crust.  Overall, I great place to eat in downtown Pittsburgh. Their drink menu is also very extensive. Unfortunately I did not sample any of the beers, but they seem to have a lot of local beers on tap. I would love to come back and try a few flights.",

The warm dressing on the spinach along with red onions and bacon just combined nicely and the nub of bread on the side made it easy to sop up the leftover dressing on the plate.  For our meal we split a carnivore pizza (yes more bacon) that was delivered quickly by our wonderful server April. The thin crusted pizza was crisp with a tasty sauce and fresh ingredients. Probably one of the better pizzas I have ever enjoyed.",

The service that we got was probably the worst part, I could have justified spending that much if we had been treated better. The waiter never came to fill our waters, we had to flag someone down after we couldn't stand it any longer. That was forgivable, maybe the place was busy, maybe they didn't see us. Then the kicker, it took them almost 45 minutes to pay and leave. It was like our waiter didn't want to get paid that day. After 20 minutes we just wanted to leave and tried to flag him down but didn't even see him.   Also they don't have fries. They only had chips and it wasn't a code for fries.",

    "text": "Another trip to the Proper before a show. According to the servers there, it's a normal thing that they experience. Lots of business right before the show and then people hustling out when the doors of the theatre open. My number one recommendation: give yourself plenty of time to eat, drink, and visit. You don't want to short change yourself but not having a relaxing meal here. My second recommendation: come back after the show for dessert and more drinks. Super nice servers and bartenders. We had a great time and will go back again whenever possible.",

    "text": "This a hidden gem in Downtown Pittsburgh -- not an overly noticeable entrance or building, but once inside you definitely feel like you've escaped the city hustle. I sat at the upper bar, which had plenty of space and is really what the entire restaurant is built around. There is also a lower bar with 3-4 seats near the brick pizza oven.  I ended up having the Fettuccine Carbonara, which was honestly one of the better carbonaras that that I've had.  5 stars here. The only thing I'd probably ask for next time is some vegetables to mix in. On top of Foods I ended up having some red wine as well (even though the drafts -- about 20- were plentiful and tempting), but really struggled to find anything worth my money. I tried their top cab and petite sirah, but both were pretty light and acidic. The petite sirah tasted as though it had turned over -- and open far too long. I ended up settling on the Chianti, which was still a bit short of expectations for the cost. Would definitely be all about this place if I could get a better glass of wine -- particularly at the higher end prices!   I really like wine with my pasta and pizza, so this really a big determining factor in my rating -- but take it for what it's worth to you. 5 stars for food. 2 stars for wine.  3 stars overall for me. That might be a different split for others. Might even bring my own wine next time...",

Originally they served us the wrong beers but they quickly realized and fixed it. Our waitress was amazing and checked back many times to make sure we liked everything we ordered. Manager was nice and walked around making sure everything was in order. One pizza is good to split between two people. I will be coming back again, especially with family from out of town.

My favorite part about the pizza was the delicious pastry-like dough even though that meant the toppings kept sliding off (no matter, I just ate them separately). The side salad and sangria were also delicious with the meal, but I was absolutely blown away by the chocolate cake (highly highly recommend). It's on the denser side and feels incredibly rich, but soo worth it!   I've had several of their pizzas (carnivores which has at least three meats, bianca which has several different kinds of cheeses, ocean's with clams and shrimps) which are all delicious, but my personal favorite is the pesto :) the variety ensures you can find your own personal favorite!",

The poutine was made up of fingerling potatoes, meat, and sauce. I was expecting fries so I was caught a little off guard, but it was actually very good! The poutine was the highlight of my experience here. The Carnivore pizza wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, but I'm sure different people have very different likes and dislikes for pizza. The pizza here had a medium crust (not too thin, not too thick), and was more on the heavy side. It definitely did the job, but just wasn't a pizza that amazed me. Perhaps next time I come I should get some drinks, given that it's a Tap Room.",

    "text": "Went for lunch. It was pretty crowded due to a show at the Benedum, but we were seated right away. It's was very dimly lit inside. The service was great, and the food was good, but it could have been better.   Had the chips and dip and bacon candy for starters. The chips and dip were very good, but the chip to dip ratio was way off. There were enough chips for two or three people, but only enough dip for one person. The pig candy had really good flavor, but it didn't seem to be cooked long enough. Some pieces were extremely chewy and none were crispy. I took it home, put it in the toaster oven, crisped it up and it was fantastic. I probably wouldn't order either appetizer again.  My sister had the Insalata Bistecca, it was tasty, but texture was an issue. They use bib lettuce, and it wilted very quickly and got very soggy under the weight of the steak and dressing. The salad wasn't overdressed which was good. It definitely could have used some sort of  crunchy element in it. Everything in the salad was just kind of soggy and soft. I had the Bianca pizza. It was delicious. Among the best pizza crusts I've ever had. It had great chew and was nicely cooked. Not too soggy and not burnt. There was plenty of cheese and it arrived piping hot. I'd order it again.  Had the Pecan Bourbon Butterscotch Bread pudding for dessert. Again, ratios were off. The piece of bread pudding was enormous, definitely enough for two people, but they give you a melon baller scoop portion of ice cream. The flavor was good but the bread pudding was pretty dry and seemed to be over cooked. The bourbon butterscotch sauce and ice cream weren't  enough to cut through the dryness. I wouldn't get it again.   Overall not a bad dining experience. A few tweaks to the items we ordered and it would have been fantastic. I'd go back, but I'd try some other menu items the next time.",

In some ways it met or exceeded expectations,  in others I was a little let down.  Highlights: the decor and atmosphere (warm, inviting,  and trendy), the bacon candy and shrimp appetizers (totally worth ordering), the black pepper paloma cocktail (yum), and the arugula salad. Our waiter did tell us that they specialize in their brick oven pizzas - so maybe I should have followed his advice.  Instead,  I ordered the lamb ragu and gnocchi. There went my night.  While the gnocchi was cooked well, the lamb ragu was pretty flavorless and skimpy.  I tried to revive it with salt and pepper (which I never do) to no avail.  I was so blue! Bottom line - order the pizza.  Maybe you'll have better luck!",

    "text": "This place is definitely worth a try, but it was just a three star experience for us. I was reluctant to try it because I saw from pictures that the seating was mostly banquette (which I strongly dislike). I was right to be concerned. First we were seated in a table by the oven. Within seconds, we were drenched in sweat. I can't believe they actually seat people there. We asked to be moved to the back, and the hostess graciously moved us.  Unfortunately a family sat next to us with a little girl who laid on the bench and kicked me throughout my meal. This is totally out of the restaurant's control, but again reinforced my distaste for banquette seating.  Our dinner was mostly enjoyable. I started with a maple old fashioned, which I can honestly say was THE best cocktail I've ever had. The person mixing drinks at Proper definitely knows what he's doing. My girlfriend had the Propermelon, and it was also quite delicious and beautifully crafted.  We started with the house chips, bacon candy, and mussels. The chips were really tasty and the caramelized onion dip was fantastic - very rich with flavor-soaked onions. The mussels were also enjoyable; the broth was delicious. The dish included a bit of corn. I don't know that it added anything to the mussels. It was ok, but I didn't love it. The bacon candy is definitely something you have to try. It's meaty and sweet and salty. Just a perfect little starter.  For my entree, I had the duck confit which was the special that night. It was absolutely perfect. The duck was cooked perfectly and just fell off the bone. The sauce was savory and delicious. It was served over a corn fritter which did a perfect job of soaking up the wonderful broth flavor.   For a place that revolves around its pizza, I have to say theirs was a letdown. My son had been looking forward to the margherita. He found theirs to be entirely unremarkable. The crust was not as crisp as he'd hoped, and was not particularly tasty. The sauce was decent; but again, nothing about this pizza was memorable.    Unfortunately the most memorable part of my visit was the overall temperature inside the place. It was impossible to enjoy my meal and my time here because I was literally dripping with sweat the whole time. Even in the far back of the space, it's incredibly hot. I don't think I'll return to this restaurant for that one single reason. If they'd turn the AC up a bit, it would make the experience more enjoyable.",

You definitely need to go well before the show as they don't have a ton of seating, they don't take reservations, and its not exactly undiscovered... The pizza is amazing and I highly recommend their Bianca pizza but make sure you add the bacon and chicken... You wont be disappointed. If you're a ranch fan they don't have it and the dressing they have thats closest to it isn't worth the up charge for it. The service has always been quick and friendly too.",

Husband had a beer flight which was neat. I enjoyed the Apricot beer. He ordered the candied bacon which he liked and their pesto pizza which was a special-also very good. I ordered the house salad which I can't say enough good things about. It was just an awesome salad. I also had the margherita pizza which was really just okay. I liked my husbands pizza way better. The server was friendly. However, as it got busier, the service was way slower. It took a long time to receive our salad and bacon and even longer after that for the pizza.  We ended up having to ask for our pizza to be put in a box and took it to our car before it even came to the table so we could walk across the street by 6:30 which was really disappointing to not be able to enjoy at the table especially since we were in and seated before 5pm.  It is a neat place and my husband is excited to go back. I just wish we didn't have to wait an hour and a half for our food.",

The atmosphere is great-- very rustic, cozy and intimate with tasteful decor. It is a bit small, so think twice before bringing a larger group, but for 2-4 people, it is great. I had the best glass of Zinfandel I've ever enjoyed here and saw that their beer list is impressive, consisting mainly of local craft brews. The service was very attentive and accommodating, allowing me to sample the wine before I ordered a glass (I am skeptical of ordering wine by the glass). My boyfriend had the Margherita pizza and we both loved it, especially the crust! I thought it could have had more cheese, but I guess I could have ordered cheese pizza if that's what I wanted. I got a special crab pasta and was underwhelmed-- it was bland and just overall a meh dish. Adding salt and parmesan cheese made it marginally better. That being said, the pasta noodles themselves were really good and I could tell they were freshly prepared. I can't wait to go back and try more pizza flavors here, but will steer clear of crab pasta.",

There is an extensive drinks menu covering beer (mostly local craft beers), wine, and cocktails. Happy hour is 4-6pm with $5 house wines and $1 off draft craft beer.  The food was all excellent. I had the candy bacon (essentially, a plate of bacon with delicious brown sugar coating - crazy unhealthy but so good) and a pasta dish. The menu says the pasta is made in house, and after eating it, I totally believe it. The pasta was so fresh and tasty. I also hear the pizzas are great (they certainly looked great) but can't comment as I didn't have any.   Overall, the bar service is the best service I've ever had at the bar. Normally it can be difficult to grab a bartender's attention, especially during busy hours (I was there at the tail end of post-work happy hour), but I always had several bartenders checking in.

The house salad used butter lettuce with goat cheese and sweetened walnuts was out of this world! The Carnivore was perfect; just enough meat so it wasn't over powering the pizza. The Bianca, Margherita, and Mediterranean were excellent as well! IMO, I would say this was the best pizza out of New York.",

I especially enjoyed the crispy potato parts of the pizza.  I also tried the Forest pizza, which came in a close second. It was loaded with mushrooms, onions and garlic. So remember your mints for later.  I really liked the crust. It wasn't as thin as I thought it would be and I like my crust a bit doughy. Was this a mistake because its supposed to be wood fire pizza? I don't know, but I enjoyed it!  I love the atmosphere in here, as they did a great job making it intimate inside. Can't wait to come back and enjoy a beer from their large list next time!",

You walk in and see a wood burning oven where they make the pizza, so it's very cozy. I went with a group for lunch on a Saturday with no reservations and we got seated fairly quickly. (4 stars)  Unfortunately, the food was a sub par. We got two pizzas, one pesto and one forest (mushrooms). Those were pretty tasty, but the crust was a bit soggy. I usually like my thin crust pizzas to be crispier. (3 stars) We also ordered two lamb rollatinis and one crab pasta to share. They were part of the specials menu. The presentation was nice, but the lamb had too much chewy (and crunchy) cartilage in the meat. I found myself wanting to (sorry this is gross) spit it out. The risotto that it sat on was undercooked and slightly crunchy. The crab pasta was meh. It definitely could have been more dynamic. I was in good company, so I had a good time, but I don't think I'd go back for the food. (2 stars)",

While it is a small place it's warm and cozy inside. I like sitting at the bar in the front near the fire where they cook the pizzas. It's cool to watch them make the pizza and tossing it around.   The service has always been great. Everyone's always been pleasant and cheery which really helps make your dining experience great.   We've been here several times and have always enjoyed our meal.",

I finally stopped in last night with a couple of friends for a late dinner. We were only inside for a moment (since we wanted to sit out front and enjoy the nice evening)--but the smell in there! It was like the most glorious scent of pizza and smoked meats. Do they make that in candle form? Because they should. Next time I will sit inside as it looked very cozy and the ambiance was nice.  I started with the Black Pepper Paloma, a tequila-based cocktail with black peppercorn simple syrup, grapefruit and lime juice, and served with a salt and pepper-rimmed glass. Amazing! I loved the contrast between the sweet fruit juices and the spiciness of the pepper. The salt and pepper rim was a nice touch and enhanced the flavor even further. I'd get this again for sure.  My friend ordered the Pepperoni Pagnotta as a starter, and it was a hit. This thing is tough to describe accurately--but imagine a three-inch tall dome of pepperoni, fontina, and the most delicious bread. The top half was basically hollow, which resulted in the \"roof\" of the dome to be nice and crispy. The lower part (housing the meat and cheese) was soft and packed with flavor. The little bread dome of perfection also came with a zesty marinara for dipping. Wonderful!  I had the Soppresatta pizza, a generous-sized pie with salami, roasted shallot, arugula, garlic spread, olive oil, and fontina. (Fontina seemed to be the theme of my meal?). You can't beat a brick oven pizza and this was no exception. The crust was amazing... soft inside and perfectly crispy on the outside. The flavors of the toppings went together nicely; there was nothing to dislike about this pizza. At $17, the pie was big enough that I have plenty left over for lunch today--not a bad deal at all!  I definitely recommend this as yet another great downtown spot for dinner and drinks!",

We were seated at the bar right in front of the brick oven. Of course it was a little warm (it gets to be over 800 degrees!), but totally bearable.  Our waitress was extremely attentive and took our order promptly even though it was very crowded. The BBQ Pulled Pork Mac & Cheese was everything you'd hope it would be. Gooey, cheesy, beefy, and hot out of the oven. We couldn't finish it all even for two of us, but it was because the pizza was filling too. The carnivore pizza came out perfect. We watched as it was prepared, put in the oven, and delivered right to our spot at the bar. It had large chunks of meat, so you got a great representation of flavor in each bite. You can really tell the difference between standard oven pizza and brick oven pizza!  Would definitely go back again, just maybe not when it's as crowded next time.",

Our waitress was really friendly even when we ended up having to wait for one of our guests to arrive. She suggested different drinks and appetizers and never let our water cups go empty.  The food was good. Better than average, but didn't blow me away or anything (hence the 4 stars). It came fairly quick, too, despite the crowded restaurant. 2 people got the steak, 3 got pizza and the other got the mac n cheese. No one complained, but again, no one was raving about anything either.  The location is great, and the service and food was good, so I would come back and check it out again.",

It was perfect while all the other local restaurants were turning people away even though they had tables available because there was an event at the convention center? ANYWAYS, we started with the chips, then had the pesto pizza and the brisket Mac. We could have done with out the chips, they were nothing special. The pizza was incredible! I absolutely loved it. And the brisket Mac was yummy, I just probably would not order it again.   The thing I loved about this place the most was how it just seemed like a well oiled machine. Everyone was very busy but everyone was getting their food on time and the workers knew what they were doing and were helping one another along the way.

They have really great pizza combinations that are fairly unique which makes choosing which type of pizza to order difficult because they all sound delicious. Finally decided on the black & gold and primavera pizza. I specifically liked the Yukon gold potato slices on the black & gold. The ingredients tasted fresh and the crust of the pizza was crisp. Highly recommend both pizzas and can't wait way to return to the restaurant to try their other choices  Now let's get to dessert. We were already pretty stuffed from the pizzas but couldn't pass up the dessert so opted for the bread pudding and Oreo cheesecake. The bread pudding was just ok. It was fairly dry. I ended up taking the cheesecake home and had it the next day and thoroughly enjoyed it.",

    "text": "I stopped here for a quick bite before heading to the Benedum Center to see Sarah Brightman in concert. The place is small but crowded. Upon arrival the hostess told me I'd get faster service if I sat at the bar. There are actually two bars but I sat at the main bar a few steps up to get out of the cold air.  Their specialties are drinks and wood fired pizza but I wanted something light so I settled for their roots salad. The pizza comes in only one size 18 inch which is not a good idea if you don't have someone to share it with nor are you allowed to bring anything into the theater due to their new security system. The pizza is served hot out of the oven and although part of the crust is a little burnt that's the way it is prepared.  I was chatting with the lady near me who had half finished a pesto pizza and believe me she told me it was good. I got my salad fairly quickly and the veggies in it were a nice size along with the full size kale that came as a base.  In addition to pizza they have other starter items and full size Italian entrees. The beer list is written on a chalkboard and includes gluten free Aurochs as part of their selections.  This is a great place for before or after theater dining since it sits less than a block away from the Benedum. Looking forward to going back with a friend to try out their pizza. Located on 7th Ave near the intersection of Penn Ave there are parking garages nearby or public transportation is available.",

    "text": "Proper Brick Oven is a downtown gem and always a favorite for my out of down friends and family.   They have rotating specials alongside a delicious seasonal menu.   Appetizers to get include the proper house chips (I lick the bowl of homemade onion dip), the panchetta wrapped shrimp, or more recently added their bowl of wings.   Their Amalfi Salad and BLT Salad are really good - large bowls with ample dressing and toppings. The Amalfi salad has olives (in case you don't like olives) and the BLT salad has HOT bacon providing some good textures and crunch in your mouth.   Entree wise - obviously their Pizza is good. The dough is homemade and cooked in their brick oven. The crust is chewy and has a good charred flavor to it. I recommend the Bianca (for meat), Funghi (nice mushroom pizza) and traditional margherita   I also like their Mushroom, Carbonara or Boar Ragu pastas (which is no longer on the menu)   Staff is always attentive! I recommend running there after a matinee show, or getting there around 4:30 on a weekend. Otherwise it will be hard to get a seat as it's always crowded and packed!   Worth the wait though!",

This place was packed, and it was for a good reason we later found out. We found a seat at the bar which was opposite of the wood fire pizza oven. We looked over their menu and watched the pizzas cook. My friends got their drinks quickly, but I kept choosing ones where they were out of the ingredients. I finally settled on an amaretto sour which was great. I got the Oreo cheesecake for a dessert. It was delicious, and more than I could eat, so I got a box and ate the remainder for breakfast the next day.  Overall, this place has a great atmosphere, drinks, and food. Worth giving it a shot if you're in the neighborhood.",

I ordered 4 individual pizzas and she told me the total was $85........say what???? So I cancelled one of them since I figured they were going to be big pizzas which they were still $61. We picked them up and my husband gave the girl $70 and she actually asked if he wanted his change.....ummmm yes he said you didn't deliver them. So I have to say they were not large pizzas and the menu prices are different than what they charged us. I don't know how they can do that but the pizza wasn't even that good. Very sloppy and poorly made. Huge disappointment because the pictures look so good. Bummer! I do not recommend this place.",

She hesitated and said we can't do that. You'll have to come in. I said I live in Mt. Lebanon so why must I come in , pay for parking , find the spot first can't you do this. She than said well call back at 5 there should be a manger in. I did not call back st 5. She was very abrupt.  I have purchased and sent gift certificates all over the US and in some very small places. Its not an issue.  So glad your business is so good that you don't need more. Lot more places in the city.",

Our server's name was Ginger and she was so lovely and attentive! I swear she filled our water glasses 10 times throughout the night.  I wasn't expecting Proper to be as fancy looking as it was, but I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it was inside. Huge bar with nice chairs all the way around.  Proper is perfectly located right downtown in the cultural district. My husband and I stopped by after a show at Heinz Hall around 9. There was people inside but there wasn't a wait for a table.  They had a nice selection of craft beers, but they were pricy. $7.50 for a beer is expensive in my opinion. We ordered the chips as an app and they were not good. They were cold! Not even just room temp, but cold! My husband got the chicken and dumpling soup. It was very good, but again, very pricy! $8 for a cup of chicken soup is ridiculous.  Now the pizzas, however were very very good! We got the carnivore and the Margherita and we loved them both. The pizzas came in 8 cuts, so there was plenty to take home for lunch the next day. The pizzas were like $16-17 which I didn't think was bad, especially because they used pretty good quality ingredients.  So long story short... go to Proper for the pizza and leave everything else behind.",

Unfortunately, on my most recent visit the pizza quality declined significantly. We ordered 2 pizzas and on both of them the crust was over 2 inches thick. Relative to the size of the pizza, this meant more than half of our bites were pure carb. I think the pizza makers were a bit sloppy/lazy on rolling out our dough. We also ordered the amalfi salad which was tossed in a very watery dressing. The salad had absolutely no flavor and desperately needed salt. Cocktails were decent, yet slightly overpriced. Overall, I think it may be awhile before I give them another chance considering there are so many fantastic options for pizza in the city.",

The chips were tasty but not the knockout that others seemed to suggest. The pizza was first rate. But the salad was spectacular. It was (from their menu), \"baby spinach / oven-roasted Roma tomato / house-cured black pepper bacon / roasted red onion / honey-Dijon vinaigrette.\" The oven roasted tomatoes were warm and played well with the dressing and house-cured bacon. This might well be the best salad I've had. My only error was choosing the half size portion!",

The food is awesome and the drink selection fantastic. Since I was alone, I sat at the bar and unfortunately was ignored by the 4 staff behind the bar even though the bar and tables were less than 50% capacity... I ended up borrowing menus from a person near me and then only got attention when I raised my hand to ask for a drink - after waiting about 10 minutes! Seemed the bar staff was very attentive to the other parties at the bar, but for some reason I was overlooked. It just may have been the person assigned to serve me specifically though, as I overheard one of the bar staff (he seemed to be 'in charge') say \" I really have no idea where he is, he keeps disappearing\". Overall- worth the trip and the $ needed to eat there, but be prepared to be a bit assertive to get the service you need.",

All really good! We had the Forest, Carnivore and Black & Gold along with the Amalfi salad. We couldn't decide which pizza was our favorite bc they were all great. I would recommend adding bacon to the B&G as it needed a little something so perhaps that was our least fav but we still finished all of it.   As a non-beer drinker, I wish they had more hard cider options but that's not a deal breaker for me. My friends were very happy with the wide selection of craft beer!  And to top it off we shared 2 desserts-- flour less chocolate cake & the almond thingy. What a wonderful way to end a great meal.   We will return as much as we can before the lines and the wait becomes too long!",

Unfortunately the pizza to us was just average.  We were kinda disappointed.   It wasn't that it was bad, just bland.   The San marzano sauce (which I personally use myself to make homemade pizza with) tasted straight out of the can with no seasoning.   The mozzarella didn't have a lot of flavor either.     The carnivore was just ok too, but must add that the homemade sausage was really good & the crust was decent!    We want to give this place more stars, but a place where the pizza should be a shining star!  It's just a glimmer, compared to the other fantastic pizza places in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I feel like I am being overly critical lately but...  First: great beer selection.  Awesome. I would go back for the beer (so maybe this is a 3 star review?). Bartenders were mixed on friendliness, one was really nice and friendly and another just seemed surly.  we all have bad days though.  ordered the meat pizza with sausage only on half (nice bartender suggested that when we were discussing if we really wanted sausage).  Ordered it \"lightly done\" as we saw lots of pies coming out with really burnt (you can call it charred but it was straight up black charcoal looking).  Great.  So then the pie comes out (i will try to remember to upload picture) and two of the slices' crusts are WAY burnt.  WAYYYY burnt.  we're like, huh, lightly done? ok.  but we were hungry.  after taking a bite, it seemed that the \"lightly done\" had to do with the rest of the crust.  it was not raw or anything like that, but just not that good either. no crispiness or anything; sort of like a microwave pizza.  and maybe that's on us for ordering lightly done, but I thought that was a pretty standard thing (at my fav place Picco, it's on their menu that the crusts come out charred so order lightly done if you don't want it).  But even pretending that we didn't order the pie lightly done, we did order sausage on half.  and you guessed it, sausage was on the entire thing.  and I know it sounds like we were being difficult, but A) the bartender suggested that and B) it wasn't busy. next issue: they left the bacon off of the pizza.  the bartender quickly took care of this by essentially throwing some bacon on it, but...  also, it seemed that they made a margharita pizza and then just threw the toppings on top (sort of like the bartender did with the bacon).  maybe that is just how they do it there but I like when the stuff is all cooked and integrated together, not thrown on top at the end.  so, because it is a pizza spot and our pizza was sub-par, I'm going 2 stars.  And it could be on us for not ordering standard, I know, but...  I will say that the people next to us got pasta and it looked pretty dang good.  I would probably go back for drinks and, if people wanted, try the food again, but I wouldn't make it a destination spot and I personally wouldn't order the pizza.",

Wood fired pizza oven and great bar with amazing beer selection. When eating alone, I usually sit at the bar.  I ordered a beer and started looking over the menu expecting to order one of the pizzas.  They had some specials, one being oven roasted flounder with fingerling potatoes and vegetable hash. Sounded pretty good so I ordered it. This is when things went south.  A couple guys next to me ordered pizzas at the same time I ordered the flounder. Theirs came right out.  After a while the bartender came by and said he would check on it. Still nothing. Finally after another long wait the flounder came out. It was in a very small bowl, and not visually appealing. I took a bite and the flavors were good, but the food was barely warm like it had been sitting a while. The bartender asked me how everything was and I told him it tasted OK but was fairly cold. He said he would let the kitchen know and see if they could do anything.  This was my first real meal of the day and being very hungry I ate it without waiting to hear back from him.  Bar areas of restaurants are usually understaffed and he was very busy.  When he came back I asked for the check and he told me there was nothing he could do. I left so hungry that I stopped by a local market on the way back to the hotel to get some snacks. I should have ordered a pizza, it would have saved several dollars and filled me up.   I feel like if a restaurant has a special, then it should actually be special and they should take care of the customers that order it.",

Awesome wall of taps, thoughtfully curated, represented a wide range of styles and small-batch producers.  While we were there, they were prepping some basil, aroma was so intoxicating (hmm, or was it the hard cider) that we got a Margherita Pizza and the Bacon Candy (caramelized in a pan with brown sugar and butter).  Bacon Candy, was, well, as you can guess, delicious.  The crust on the pizza was thin in the middle, had a nice puffy crust which was airy, fluffy, and chewy, some black bits, but since it was early in the day, the char was mostly from leftover cornmeal in the oven vs. char on our actual crust.  \"Sauce\" was more like hand squeezed whole tomatoes strewn all over the crust, too many and oversalted.  Overall, decent pie, we asked for extra basil, def go for it.",

They have a solid variety of local beers with a good mix of imports and seasonals. Their staff isn't quite as beer savvy as you would want with the selection- they described two beer styles completely different than what they actually are so you might want to look up stuff yourself. We got the black and gold pizza and this is some of the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. The house chips and caramelized onion dip was fantastic as well as the pepperoni pagnotta.

We also tried fresh chips/dip - tastey.  Candy bacon - excellent pork belly.  The Italian donut dessert was amazing!  Staff was friendly, great service!   Convenient location near Benedum.  Right across the street from the theater parking lot.",

    "text": "WOW!  This place was REALLY good.  Started out with the bacon candy!  LOVED it.  Bacon cooked in the pizza oven with brown sugar and pepper...just enough to enhance the flavor of the bacon.  Highly recommended.  Then we shared a BLT salad, again it was surperb.  The spinach was fresh, bacon was spot on and not drowned in the vingerette dressing.  We also shared the Forest pizza...this was at our waiters suggested...I was hesitant as I don't really like mushrooms, but this was good.  The mushrooms were carmalized so they did not over power the rest of the pizza.  By far the BEST pizza crust...it was thin but not paper thin, had flavor and was crispy.",

It doesn't look like much from the outside and my only complaint would be that it is kind of a smaller place, but that is expected downtown. My group of 4 guys split 2 pizzas and they were amazing. We had a \"meat lover's\" type pizza and another with garlic and other cheeses, both were awesome. We also split an app that was like a pizza roll with pepperoni and cheese inside. Small, but cheap and good. They have a cool selection of beers and their Pittsburg (Moscow) Mule was very good. I would highly recommend.",

They had a pretty impressive beer list, including some less common west coast selections; prices were reasonable at $6-7 for a pint of craft beer.    The 8 guys in our group ended up splitting 4 pizzas...that amount seemed about right.  We had the forest pizza, the carnivore, the soppressatta, and the pesto.  I was amazed at how different they all were, and everything was uniquely delicious.  The forest was a perfect autumn umami mushroom bomb.  I thought the soppressata was a better balanced \"classic\" meat pizza than the carnivore, but both were excellent.  The pesto had a pretty strong flavor profile; merely the least-good pizza in an impressive quartet.  Very highly recommended!",

    "text": "A group of us stopped by for an early lunch before seeing a White Christmas. At 11:30 we were about the only people in the restaurant though by 1230, it was packed. I was surprised to see that the majority of the space inside was taken by the bar. There were some tables in font, on the side and behind the bar but, I imagined the inside space to be bigger the several times I walked by.  I started my lunch with a half house salad. Within a few minutes our waitress brought out the first course. The salad consisted of bibb lettuce, candied walnuts, pears and goat cheese in a white Balsamic dressing. I opted for no goat cheese. The sweet dressing paired nicely with the crisp pears and crunchy walnuts. There was even a small piece of a savory bread loaf on the side. I honestly couldn't have asked for a better salad. Everything about it was perfect. Speaking of perfection, within a few minutes, my entree - Margherita pizza arrived. This was easily the best Margherita pizza I have had in years. The San marzano tomatoes tasted like the we're picked off the vine and crushed specifically for my pizza, so fresh. The house made mozzarella was melted to perfection. The crust had the exact amount of crisp and crunch one would desire. I almost didn't want to share but alas, I was unable to finish all of the 8 (!!!!) slices so I offered it around. I also happened to get to try a few of the desserts on the menu which changes frequently. My favorites were the apple jack Gelato and the cherry cheesecake with a fruity pebble crust. Who knew that kids' cereal could be reinvented into something so yummy. I felt like we were in an episode of Chopped. Overall, the service was great, the atmosphere was pleasant and the food was incredible. This will be my new go to before seeing a show.",

We weren't sure how hungry we were, so we just ordered one pizza- a meet lovers with sausage, pepperoni and bacon. Simply outstanding. And filling, Their selection of craft beers must reach two dozen varieties -- if not more. Prices are reasonable. The interior architecture is eye-catching. Open space with a large multi-sided bar offering great sight lines of the dining area and ovens. If you like a traditional Italian pizza, this is your stop. Be aware -- don't expect gobs of rubbery cheese and gummy dough. The pizzas here are works of art. If you want a $2.50 slice, go around the street corner and get something else.",

    "text": "This is a solid place to eat downtown.  The tap list is one of the better in the city and I give them major props for carrying a lot of Pittsburgh area small micro brew beers as well as many regionals mixed in with some national craft drafts.  No crap on tap here.  My fiancee and I started with the PEI mussels which were a bit over cooked but tasted very good with their beer/tomato broth.  We ordered the soppressata pizza, which was very nice.  The crust was a little overdone in some spots, but it's brick oven, so that is a bit expected.  Honestly, I'll take that over the soggy crappy crust so many Pittsburgh pizza places give you.  The toppings were flavorful and the sprinkling of Parmesan on top given by the wait staff set the pizza off well.   For dessert, we split the flourless chocolate cake with berry compote and fresh whipped cream.  It was very good as well.  My largest complaint here would be the drink prices.  Some of the beers offered were $8.50, which is too high, regardless of ABV.  There was not a draft beer on tap lower than $6.50.  If you go for dinner and drinks, you tab will add up quickly so keep that in mind.  You will enjoy dinner no matter how much you spend.",

Sean will great you at the door, Julie will make sure you well taken care of and if you are lucky enough to meet Chef Jerome you night will be complete.  Perfect date night place.

    "text": "This place is awesome, has a really nice and relaxed atmosphere. Really big bar area, very nice bartenders, a little small when dining because the tables and bar are a bit close but it can't be helped, they have lack of room because of the building layout. Not too busy on a nice Sunday night. The cutlery was in good shape i.e. No bent forks, no stains on the butter knifes etc. lots of neat things to look at and keep distracting while waiting for food. For this night, I had the 'Proper chips' which was only $4, comes with crisp potato chips and a French onion sort of dip which was delicious. Also the server brought me more chips after I ran out without me asking. For the meal we had the 'carnivore' pizza, it was absolutely delicious. It was equivalent to a medium/large pizza in size. It came with sausage and chicken on it, sausage was good but the chicken was very good, and had tons of flavor. The pizza was a flat pizza with a thick crust. Was made to perfection. Had the right amount of grease/solidity ratio so you could pick it up and still get a good greasy pizza. The bathroom is located in the front. It was a single person bathroom, but had a ottoman in there next to the toilet, prefect for girls night or if you're a parent. Also was very good looking and clean. The total came to about $26 dollars which is perfect for a date night. Very excellent service, water always filled, nearby if you needed anything. Rated 5 stars because it actually deserves it.",

    "text": "I located Proper while snooping around Yelp for an alternative to Il Pizzaiolo which had been our normal dinner spot when we make the occasional trip into town for a show.  We went on a Friday evening and there was a 30 or so minute wait for a table for two.  Once seated, we had a cozy table in the corner by the pizza oven.  Our server was friendly and helpful and she made frequent stops to check in to see if we needed anything.  To start, we split an order of the house chips and they were wonderful - thinly sliced and had a perfect balance of crunch/chewiness. The onion dip that comes with the chips was nicely done as well -- just the right bite of flavor but not overpowering.  My wife had a house salad and Margherita pizza for her meal and she had great things to say about both.  Her only regret was not ordering outside of her comfort box and getting a more daring pizza.  I started with the Tuscan sausage soup which I enjoyed and had the pot pie which was very nicely done.  It looks HUGE when it arrives but it worked out to be just the right size -- big enough that I was filled but not so big that I had to force myself to finish it.  Somehow the whole thing seemed to remain piping hot the entire time I was eating it -- it didn't seem to cool off at all!  The beer selection appeared to be all domestics, which for me was a bit of a downer.  I am more traditional in my beer preference and tend to stick with established European brews.  I am not a fan of the goofy named craft offerings that are trendy at the moment  - I would have much preferred a wheat offering from Weihenstephaner, Franziskaner, Paulaner, Ayinger or Erdinger with my meal but the available Monkey Boy wheat wasn't horrible.  Overall, a very nice dinning experience.  Unfortunately, we didn't save room for dessert but from what we saw being delivered to some of the other tables, the desserts looked good, really GOOOD..   We'll be back again when we make the next trek into the city to see A Servant To Two Masters in a few weeks at the O'Reilly.  Updated:  12/6/15 - We visited Proper again last night before we went to see a show at the O'Reilly.  We sat at the bar this time as the wait for a table might have caused us to miss the start of the show.  Everything was fine but this time around wasn't quite as filling as the last time -- in retrospect, we probably should have started with a pizza or something.  Service was fine at the bar although no one stopped to check on us to see if we needed anything once our food was served until all we had in front of us was empty plates and glasses.",

Victory, Troegs, Rogue, these are all good, but there are plenty of other exciting beers out there.  That said, my pizzas have been terrific, wood-fired deliciousness. Aside from the wood-burning pizza oven, the atmosphere is fine - not remarkable. Service has been friendly and well-executed both times I've been there.

We have went as a couple and with our 6 year old. The only downside is that they can`t do kids meals at brunch. Their pizza is phenomenal: we have enjoyed the simple Margherita pizza and the meat pizza. The crust has always been perfect and the toppings are not overbearing. The cocktails are on par and absolutely refreshing. Try a cucumber moscow mule! The beer list is ever-changing and full of choices. I would highly recommend the new brunch bread pudding. I \"think\" it was really healthy... even though it tasted like cake and only had one scoop of whipped cream on the side. The alfani salad is simple, but really good as well. We all really enjoyed it. The servers are always so nice and personable. If you are downtown or heading to a show in the cultural district, do yourself a favor and go to Proper! You will LOVE it! They do reservations but for parties of 6 or more.",

The bar chairs are comfy (albeit a little hard to get into and out of because they are crammed in there).  The bar list is excellent, with cocktails, beer, and wine sure to please anyone.   The food has always been very good, but there are weird little annoyances.  For example, they have a hummus platter (which is excellent); but it's served with a super-skimpy portion of pita (which is not excellent).  I feel like they should have figure that whole thing out by now.    Service has been hit or miss, with mostly misses.  On my most recent visit, it was not busy at all because it was still early.  There were FIVE people behind the bar, yet our drinks were empty for at least 5 minutes until we finally caught someone's attention.  That just shouldn't happen.",

We were seated immediately and our food came out quickly.   For a healthy appetizer, try the roasted sprouts with cranberry and bacon bits - they were delicious and flavorful without being overdone, and you get a huge portion. The fish and chips are fried in duck fat, which gave them a perfect crispiness without excess grease; the tartar sauce was perfect. The flavor will a little more savoy/smoky than the typical typical fish and chips, but it still tasted great. The margarita pizza was cooked well, but it could have used a tiny bit less oil and more seasoning (especially salt). Overall, it was an excellent dining experience.",

The food was very good, just a couple things that would make the food better. I started with the pepperoni pagnotta, which I was very happy with, but the dough was just a little too hard and crunchy, not as soft and easy to eat as I was expecting. I also had the fig & pig pizza, which was SO good but I would have liked more cheese/sauce--there was an entire piece of pizza that was only spinach basically. Also shared the crab spaghetti, which was absolutely delicious but could have been a little spicier just to give it a kick of flavor. For drinks, I got the St. Peno, which was a little bitter/tangy for me, but then I absolutely loved the heavy Maple Old Fashioned and would definitely order that one again.  I would definitely come back here to try a lot of other items on the menu that look very good, and especially the desserts.",

Pizza menu will not disappoint.  Amazing beers on tap. If you have just woken up like I did at 4pm try the Mexican coffee porter! It's perfect!  The staff is so friendly and great too!

The Arsenal Christmas cider was on tap, which, if you haven't tried it, you're missing out! It's delicious!  This visit we had the bacon candy, yum! BLT salad... which was so so. Mostly just spinach with a little bit of bacon. No \"T\" surprisingly! My faith was renewed however by the Arsenal dry Cider! Not too sweet, a little tart, just right! For the main course we had the Finnochio pizza. It was great! Onions and goat cheese? Yes please! For dessert (see pictures) he had the blueberry Panna cotta... which was to die for! I had the cheesecake, which was good, but not as great as I expected!  Overall, a great atmosphere if you're looking for a romantic dinner in downtown Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "The first thing I noticed when walking in, was the smell. For me, wasn't a pizza smell, like you would expect, but a coal-firey, brick oven smell. So cozy and warm, it made me want to stay awhile.  We grabbed some seats at the bar after being told it would be about a half hour wait... Literally 3 minutes later, we were told a table was ready. The bar is really spacious (see pics) and the chairs are large and comfortable; we decided to stay at the bar.  The girl that took our drink order wore dreads and a high bun, and was not very attentive. She was kind at best and sort of rushed me with placing my drink order. I saw her behind the bar laughing with the manager(?) and striking a lighter behind the bar while talking (loudly) about her weekend plans. I love when people love their jobs,  but could you get my wine first? Then another lady took our orders (who was much better in my opinion), although I didn't catch her name. It was a little confusing with the flip-flopping of servers, considering there were no introductions or \"let me explain what type of place this is, this is your first time\", but it was fine in the end.  Random, but I really did love the plates, glasses, and cutlery here. Very modern and matched the ambiance nicely, I thought.  I ordered the Ocean pizza and he ordered the Carnivore. Following the obligatory taste test, we both agreed we enjoyed the flavors in the ocean pizza better than the carnivore. The ocean had clams, shrimp, and possibly scallops with a garlic paste and fontina cheese... Some type of lemon aioli was in it, and who knows what else because it was so delicious, I stopped tasting for awhile. The meat on the other pie was very good and not too salty, as most meat pizzas tend to be. The crust was on the softer side. It was perfect, doughy, and delicious, in my opinion. Although my husband prefers more of a crispy-bottomed pie, he still finished it without complaints. The toppings were generous and after completion, we were both full, but not stuffed. Aka, we could walk comfortably out of the restaurant, which I am not used to!   The bathrooms were clean with plenty of mirrors to pick the pizza sauce out of your teeth afterwards... our check was about $65 for 2 pies, and about 3 drinks. Not too shabby.   We migrated for dessert, so next time I'm here, I would definitely love to try out some of their sweets, specifically, the candy bacon.   The reasons for the 3 starts goes as follows: one of the main reasons we chose to stay seated at the bar is due to there being a skinny little aisle to walk down, which you share with the servers and the backs of anyone else sitting in the aisle. So the tables are all in a row and if you sit in a chair, your back is kind of in the open and you're constantly having to move in (I would assume). The bar is huge, but instead I think they should put all that extra space into seating, since it felt a little crampy when walking. I decided I would be really annoyed if I had to constantly push my chair in due to people walking behind me all night.   The second reason is, when I eat out somewhere, I'm always hoping for an experience. I need that something that makes you stand out from other brick ovens, and a large opportunity for that to happen is during the server/customer interaction. There wasn't a whole lot of that for me and it kind of dulled the experience. Great food? Yes. Good prices? For sure. Ambiance? Check... Some small kinks to work out that cost a few stars, but I would certainly return.",

Honestly, this was a great dining experience, from the attitude of the workers, to the decor, and everything in between.   I got one of the specials- the scallops with couscous. It was delicious and cooked perfectly. We also go the Candy Bacon as an appetizer. It was very good but it was literally a plate of bacon (I don't know what I was expecting but again, so, so good).   Kyle was our server and he was engaging and funny and was clearly knowledgeable about the menu. I can really respect when a server will spend a few extra moments with you to make sure you're having a good experience. With that being said- every employee we saw was behaving the same way and I feel confident that my experience would have been just as great where ever I was lucky enough to sit.",

First, it wasn't crowded and we waiting at every single step in the process (except, we were seated immediately)... it took forever for drink orders, food orders, food, interim service & the check. The family next to us didn't get one of their orders until all were done eating. Our food was really good- French toast, potato hash (?) & chicken & waffles. Our drinks were watered down- as in water like (sangria); and, I rarely, if ever, say this. Perhaps the most annoying part was that the server did not bring syrup. Since he was awol, I had to physically hunt him down & ask. He said the waffles had syrup on them... you could see that I needed to convince him of my need! When he gave me syrup, it was a minuscule amount! I had to ask for more syrup- I ran out again. And no, I don't have a problem with syrup... the waffles were dry as can be! All in all, a mixed bag.",

For dessert, my hubby and I shared the Emily's chocolate cake? it was just ok.  My hubby was disappointed because he thought it was a real chocolate cake and the presentation didn't help either.  It was a dense flourless chocolate cake, super rich with a berry sauce.  Our friends got the bread pudding and the toasted almond dessert, which both looked good and the presentation on the almond dessert was nice.  For drinks, my hubby had a stilleto, which is usually a drink he enjoys but the fruit juice they used and whatever else in the mix ruined it for him bc the stilleto he's used to is only makers mark and amaretto.  He's a big whisky drinker.  I had their cider, which I enjoyed bettter than an angry orchard.  It tasted more crisp and less sweet. They have a great variety of beers on tap, but the one thing the birthday boy wanted, they ran out off. oopsies!  The server did make another recommendation, and she was pleasant and attentive to our table.    This place looks bigger on the outside, but it was really small and crowded inside that there's barely a walkway.  We had one of the two big tables in the back for larger groups, but I can see how the smaller tables in the front can have no privacy bc you are so close to others and anyone walking the aisle would have to walk in single file.  I can't imagine having the seats by the aisle always having to be conscious about moving the seat to make way for diners.  Not a lot of room to move.  The decor was very nice and appropriate.  I love the use of mason jars for decor and drinks.  They also have a nice size of a bar with tvs.  The other off putting issue is that my friend said when she made reservations that they had a list of random and strange rules some are understandable like everyone in the party must be present before being seated but there was a 2 hr time limit for the table.  Luckily, it's winter and in negative wind chill, so they weren't too busy.  We did only stay for 2 hrs anyway.  I definitely recommend this place for food and drinks, but not for claustrophobics and parties bigger than 8 otherwise definitely make that reservation.",

We were a bit leery because it was after 9pm and we had 2 school aged kids (just in from a long drive) but they were great. The place is definitely geared toward an adult crowd but our foodie kids found plenty they liked too. A great first dinner in Pittsburgh!",

The food is great, and the place is so cozy that you just want to stick around.  Go at a peak time and you are not getting in.  It would be a destination meal, not a place to go when you are on a time limit. The blood orange gin and tonic is a nice variation, bolognese pasta is a return to dish, and of course the bacon candy is to die for. Go at an off time and enjoy!",

I went with a pesto pizza (I wanted leftovers that would keep in the hotel minifridge) and it was good- pretty traditional, but the wood fired element made it perfectly charred and crispy.",

We tried the Finocchio (comes topped with goat cheese). It's between Proper and Mercurio's for best gourmet pizza in the burgh, but they're slighted edged by Mercurio's when it comes to topping pairings. Proper is truly a restaurant and a bar where Mercurio's offers old-world charm. I still love Proper and it's a standout amongst the prices venues in the Cultural District.",

I have my own wood fired pizza oven at home and take my pizza seriously.   Some people may like this pizza, but I found it lacking of flavor and texture.....most of the shortcomings having to do with the dough. No real taste or structure. Not bad, but IMO not worth the money.  That being said, the people were nice and i did like the draft beer list. Maybe 20-30 beers on tap which I really did enjoy. I would go back to have a few beers but skip the pizza.",

I arrived at 4:30 with plans to meet friends for an early dinner. I was able to get a table without a reservation at this time on a Saturday.   They have an extensive beer, wine and cocktail list, and I chose to have a glass of the 2011 Gen 5 Zinfandel from Lodi. Top notch.   The waitress, Kali, was very attentive and pleasant. She revisited to give us time to make our decisions.   We started with the antipasto as an appetizer. It came with duck, sopressata, buffalo mozz drizzled with a balsamic glaze and basil. There were also pickled veggies and a really good bread-like side that complemented everything. Also unique was the lemon ricotta spread.   All of our dinners were excellent. I had the lamb special, while my friends enjoyed the carnivore pizza and the funghi pasta.   Wonderful experience and we will be back!",

As such, it wasn't too busy but I wouldn't be surprised it was much more busy on nights where there are shows nearby at the Benedum Center (it's downtown near here) or on the weekends in general when people tend to have more time/not have to go to work in the morning. I ended up ordering Bacon Candy and the Carnivore Pizza. Boy did the Bacon Candy end up being a delightful way to start. Did not expect that bacon could taste so sweet, yet so good at the same time. It wasn't dry at all in my mouth, which meant that it was fried just right (not overfried/overcooked) and as such, it was a worthy appetizer to begin the meal. Next came the Carnivore Pizza, which (if the name doesn't give it away enough) is a pizza with a load of meat on the top, including belly bacon, Italian sausage, and pepperoni. The pizza was just fantastic. The meats were incredibly yummy and wonderfully complemented one another and as such, it was just a great meal all around. Highly worth coming here if you haven't been here before. One of the better pizza places to try in Pittsburgh, if you ask me.",

After a bit of drinking on Saturday night, we woke up rather late on Sunday and wanted to grab a bite to eat. We walked the streets, looking at menus in windows, but nothing really sang to us.   We happened to stumble upon Proper and nearly walked past it. Looking at it from the outside, to be honest wasn't too inviting. But, we decided to check out the menu just in case. We opened the door and were immediately greeted by a very friendly man who handed us a menu. I took a look around the cozy restaurant and smelled with brick oven going...glanced at the beer list on the wall and was sold.   The gentleman who greeted us introduced himself as Todd and told us he would be our server. I was a bit overwhelmed with the beer list and Todd gave me his recommendations based on my preferences. He also let me sample three beers, all of which I loved!   I ordered the frittata, which had caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes and was topped with arugula that was tossed in olive oil and sea salt.  BEST. FRITTATA. EVER. It was light and fluffy and the peppery arugula accented it perfectly!   My SO ordered \"proper eggs\" which essentially reads two eggs. I remarked how boring of an order it was, BUT, when it came out it had two pieces of toasted brioche (which I stole and consumed rapidly) and a fresh fruit salad. The brioche was up there with the best I have had, I even inquired if it was made there, hoping to be told it was not, so I could purchase some to take home! But, the bread is made in house daily. Man was it good. I'm drooling as I type this review three days later!  As funny as it sounds, I know it was just a late breakfast, but it was my absolute favorite meal while in the Burgh.   Kudos to you Proper for having such a pleasantly staffed restaurant, a cozy atmosphere and an amazing beer list. Todd was just awesome and I hope that when I come back, he's working!",

This place gets a little busy and I don't think they take reservations.  I can tell you that you definitely won't get seated without your entire party present.  So get everyone together before you go inside! This is a small restaurant that is on the cozy side.  There is a row of tables with an aisle and then the bar on the other side.  This creates an issue if you're on the outside of your table - wait staff and patrons are going to continue to walk behind you so you have to really pull your chair in.  I get easily annoyed and distracted by that, but I'm a high anxiety type of person so it might not bother other people. I am a big fan of the bianca pizza.  It's fresh, has a great thin crust, and while light, it is filling.   Nice wine list and some cool novelty type mixed drinks.   This is a nice place for dinner before a show.",

    "text": "Mmm. I generally liked the food and atmosphere here. We got to sit at the psuedo-bar that looks straight into the brick oven. It was very fun to get to watch the pizza-makers do their thing -- they cooked probably ~50 pizzas during just the time we were there for dinner.  It looked like a hard and tiring job!  The food seemed to be generally very heavy (they are generous with the oil and cheese), but pretty good.  The gnocchi appetizer was not your traditional gnocchi: the pieces were enormous, and covered in EVOO, cheese, greens, and fried garlic.  Greasy but tasty!  We also shared a Forest Pizza.  The crust was amazing...wow!!  The perfect combination of doughy and crusty and flavorful.  The toppings were nice as well, but I was a little disappointed by the flavor and texture of the mushrooms the way they were chopped.  The menu description gave the impression that there would be a larger variety of mushrooms, and I thought they were a bit too chunky (would have been nice to have thinner slices).  There is a large beer selection, but the prices are pretty steep for the pours you get, which are mostly less than a full pint for the good beers.",

It was very close to our hotel and on the way to the ballpark, so we stopped in for dinner before the game.  We ordered the Margherita pizza and the Proper House salad. It was perfect to share between the two of us and we loved it so much we went back the next day and the next!  We tried other Pittsburgh 'musts' like Primanti Brothers and Pamela's Diner, but this was our vote for best restaurant in Pittsburgh!!",

It's a little on the thicker side and there's a nice subtle sweetness to it that I liked. Usually, I need to have a sauce for my crust as its bland or dry, but I could eat Proper's alone. My husband ordered the Carnivore and I ordered the Soppressata. Toppings were fresh. The pizza was very enjoyable.   I also came here another time and ordered drinks and their mussels appetizer. I can't recall the cocktail I ordered but I remember it being tasty. The mussels were in a nice garlic broth that wasn't too overpowering. They also threw some tomatoes in with the mussels which was a nice fresh addition to the dish.   The atmosphere is really nice, really dark, but nice. And the smell of the brick oven that hits you when you walk in is divine. Although the pizzas were solid, the prices are a little high. However, it's kind of worth it!",

Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Previously,  I had tried their pizzas, salads and even sandwiches. Today I got the Chicken Caprese sandwich with homemade chips. It was delicious! The chicken was grilled and tender with the crispy bacon. I also enjoyed the sauce and the fresh bun. Note that I'm picky about bread and this one didn't disappoint.  The only downside is that it was a bit too oily for me to the point where the oil dripped all over my hands and on my chips (perhaps it was olive oil). To top it off, we ordered bread pudding and shared it. The bread pudding was yummy!! It came out warm with blueberries and the white chocolate just made it melt in your mouth.   It's was a bit weird having lunch with a group of people since pizzas have a different kitchen than sandwiches/salads so our food didn't come out all at once. Some people were eating while the others were staring of hunger. Sandwiches are priced at about $10 and pizzas at $16. Other than the food not coming out at the same time and being pricey, I think it's a good restaurant overall.",

I'd be curious to try some of their other things besides pizza, but we were in a bit of a time crunch and our spending money was a little less than we would have liked. I enjoyed myself. The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable.   When I return to try more food I shall update this to reflect, though I have a feeling it'll be just as good as that great wood-fired pizza we had!",

The ambiance of the restaurant was trendy and warm, it's small enough to not feel drafty, but I can see it being hard to get a table on a super busy night.  They have happy hour from 4-6, with $5 wines, and $1 off drafts or something. We got the wine, and it was good. We got the bacon candy which was also good, but it was basically just a plate of bacon. So if you have a problem with eating a plate of bacon, don't get it. I do not have a problem with it. I got the hot honey chicken, and I was SO HAPPY. the chicken was delicious, and the sides were kale and sweet potatoes and they were perfectly seasoned.   All of the delicious food aside, the service was absolutely awesome. Our server, Kyle, was so great. He came over just frequently enough to make sure we were always taken care of, but not to the point of being a bother. He gave me quality feedback on some of the choices I was considering, and he was so friendly. Everyone we encountered was seriously so nice. I basically wanted to hang out with them all night long.  Bonus points for the bathrooms in the basement for being super warm and nice. It was a treat, because a basement bathroom can get super cold in the winter.",

Cocktails are delicious and they have an expansive selection of craft brews to choose from at any given time.   The pizza is all that we have explored to this point. They have a great selection of other food, but we have yet to venture away as we can't get enough! The Margherita, Mediterranean, and Forest are amazing, with the Forest definitely being our favorite. The combination of mushrooms with the balsamic reduction sauce is incredible! Each time we have been, it is usually in the evening hours after dinner. We frequent Proper right before or after shows downtown and each time it has been quite busy. We have not waited longer than about 20 minutes to be seated. The space can feel very tight when they are busy, and this can be a turn off at times. People are bumping into each other and waiter's/waitresses are struggling to get by people and chairs from dining tables. Parking can be difficult as well as street parking is limited. A garage is probably your best bet. Definitely a place to check out if you love brick oven pizza!",

We knew we wanted to do both pizza and an entree and chose the pesto pizza and apple scallop risotto. The pesto pizza was delicious. The olive oil was a bit much so the toppings were slipping off the slice, but we enjoyed it nonetheless. The scallops in the scallop risotto were phenomenal. My girlfriend says they were the best she's ever had. They were enormous and cooked perfectly. The downside, is that the risotto didn't quite match. We both thought it was undercooked and disappointing flavor wise. If the risotto was better this easily would be a five star meal. With the waiters suggestion we ordered the cheesecake for dessert. You could really tell it was homemade and it was quite good. Definitely enough for at least two people. Overall, we would both come again.",

Had the ocean pizza, which was unique and delicious (I loveee seafood but haven't really come across seafood pizza before) and my friend ordered the carnivore, which had a ton of meat on it, although wasn't as special of a pizza (in his words). The crust is my favorite part, firm enough to hold toppings but soft and seasoned enough that it feels like a breadstick!   Little overpriced but would come again.",

I wouldn't pick up the slice because it was either too much toppings or too soggy or both. That already failed my test if I need a fork to eat a god damn pizza. I wouldn't recommend their new dish pizza. From the reviews, other pizza might have been a better choice. I also got the chips for the appetizer. Avoid that as well. The chips has good texture but lack flavor ... Some pre-seasoning would be great.   Anyway the service was great tho! Very enthusiastic bartender. Modern decor and good atmosphere.   Will come back for a second try.",

Pizzas are fresh and creative. The sensational smell of a wood fired oven can be in your senses even 2 blocks away.   Entrees are rich and hearty (seasonal)  Great salads and sandwiches   HUGE beer tap menu with IPA's, Ales, Porters and seasonal beers. Full Bar also with a creative craft cocktail list.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate his birthday. We went on a Saturday, and it was busy, but we were seated in about 10 minutes or so.  We both ordered a Proper House Salad that is prepared with goat cheese, pear, and candied walnuts, and tossed with a white balsamic dressing. You have the option to have the half size ($6) or the full size ($10; pictured). We both opted for the regular size since we were hungry, and it's a good thing we did because the salad wasn't that large. It's not that we wanted to fill up on salad, but for $10 each, I think the salad was over-priced.   We ordered the carnivore pizza, and it was so good that we ordered one to go for lunch the next day. It was just the right amount of pizza. I usually prefer a more seasoned tomato sauce on my pizza, but since there was a lot of flavor with the different meats, the overall taste was pretty balanced. The price of the pizza was a little high ($17-$18), but this was a special occasion.   We finished the night with the strawberry-lemon cheesecake. I didn't get a chance to take a picture of this because it was so good! I didn't even look at the cost on this part of our meal.  Overall, the experience was really great! We had a great time, great food, and great service. We will probably go back, but not frequently due to the cost.",

    "text": "We went here before a show at the Benedum center and it was pretty disappointing. Two people, two appetizers, one 8slice pizza, a couple drinks each and desert for a total of $110.   The ambience was nice except that they had made sure to squeeze a butt into every possible square foot in the room so it felt cramped and hard to get around.   Wait staff was nice, no complaints there other than the fact that we felt like maybe our waitress was kind of hoping we'd eat and run instead of stay and chat over our $13 drinks.   The drinks were the best part of the meal.   Everything else was OK. If the end of the night bill would have been half as much I may feel less negative about it, but clearly this was not good demanding the cost and the ownership obviously just sees the location as warranting charging $18-25 per mediocre dish.  The Cheesecake was not really Cheesecake but a dry bread style cake with a thin layer of cheesecake ontop. The greasy lack luster pizza could have been bested by any number of cheap pizza joints. The appetizers were nothing to write home about.   All in all...The people were friendly and it was a move spot to kill some time before a show with a couple drinks. But nothing more than that.",

It was the perfect happy hour, post traffic, pre show choice.   Four of us shared the pepperoni and cheese starter, followed by the Tuscan Sausage Soup, and various salads, including the BLT Salad.  All very lovely and tasty.    We also chose the Mediterranean and White Pizzas.  These pizzas would have been perfect for two...  had it not been for the appetizer, soup and salads. Both were flavorful with the crust done just right. Our clear favorite was the White, as we left a couple slices of the Med... figuring the other show goers preferred that we not take home!

It took a very long time to get seated because the hostess was no where to be found - not the greatest first impression. The interior itself was beautifully decorated. The darker lighting gives the restaurant a more intimate feel.   Our waitress came very swiftly to take our orders. Our table split the Proper House Chips which came with a french dip. I definitely recommend it for a quick snack before your meal! I had the half Proper House Salad for my starter which was great but so puny! I'm not sure a couple pieces of lettuce is worth $6. For the main course, I kept it traditional with a Margherita pizza. It was very appetizing but surely not the best pizza I've had. It was fairly average, but if I'm paying $15 for a personal pizza, I expect something special. Anyone who knows me knows that I absolutely need ranch with my pizza, and Proper didn't have ranch! None?! How is that possible??   The meal was fine, but for the prices, I would say skip this place and grab 5 pizzas at Pizza Hut for the same quality. Sorry, Proper, I'll get my pizza cravings satisfied elsewhere.",

    "text": "This place was seriously awesome.   They have a rotating beer list which in my opinion is, well, the tops! Every time you go you'll see something different and that's awesome plus tons of local breweries. Which was great for us since it was our first time in Pittsburgh.   We got the bacon candy...yes bacon candy. Do it. It's chewy but hard but sweet but salty. It's perfect. Followed by the Bianca pizza. Which had burrata cheese and like three other cheeses on it. It was amazing. The crust was chewy but crunch so perfect. And to round it out we luckily had the best bartender ever Jason who was able to get us the cookie dough cheesecake even though it was past dessert hours. (After 9:45 they only do pizzas) and when I tell you you need to try this cheesecake, this life changing,gut changing, mind blowing, super delicious perfect combination cheesecake I'm not exaggerating. It was soooooo good, yes six o's good.   Honestly the nicest part of our visit was Jason. He was such a nice human. He let me try a few beers before I picked one, he shared awesome pickles with us (which he said they make a cocktail out of the pickles juice..yes we will be back for that. A pickle juice cocktail, how could that be bad! That's right it can't be) and he was just genuinely a nice dude who is probably the main reason we need to come back. It's rare you get someone who's actually into talking to you and making sure you're doing well and enjoying everything. Really really great dude. You should defiantly stop by and tip him well!   All in all great spot, with really good people and really good food. 10/10 would recommend.",

You walk up a few steps and there is a long bar on the right and tables on the left.  We didn't drink, but it looked like they had 32 different beers on tap.  I had the chicken and dumpling soup, a special, which was amazing.  It was rich and homey and perfect.  The boyfriend had the bacon candy, which he really enjoyed.  We also got a pizza, the margherita add pepperoni.  It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  The crust has an excellent taste and texture, fluffy yet crispy.  The pizza is kind of small.  It was a good size to split with the appetizers, but could definitely be eaten by one person.  We also tried the peanut butter pie, it was okay, but not very sweet.  I would skip the pie and eat more pizza!",

The atmosphere inside is cozy and welcoming- to me it is perfect for a chilly Pittsburgh night. They don't take reservations for parties of less than 6, so I put my name in and was seated at the bar by the great hostess. As we waited at the bar I had the Winter sangria (super yum!), one girl had the \"Cherries In the Snow\" cocktail which was just ok, and my other friend had an IPA. The couple next to us was served extra chips and gave them to us! That was a great start to the evening. They were served with a caramelized onion dipping sauce which was  just as addicting as it sounds. When we were seated, we ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer (I'm pretty sure this was a special) and salads to start. My friend and I shared the house salad. Both starters were great!  For dinner, we shared the pesto pizza and the forest pizza. OH MY GOD! The pesto pizza had bacon on it too which was a fabulous touch! 2 pizzas were the perfect size for sharing with 3 people. I can't wait to visit Proper again!",

    "text": "We decided to drop by on a recent Sunday night.  The place was not busy at all, just a few lone diners at the bar and a couple of other couples scattered about.  First off, I love the decor.  The wood burning brick oven on the lower level surrounded by a small bar for those who want to watch their pizza being made.  Up a half flight of stairs, there is the rich red brick wall behind the massive bar.  Love the rustic light fixtures and the butter yellow covered banquet and chairs and beautiful wood tables.  The menu has some nice choices of snacks, salads and pizzas.  They also have some interesting seasonal specials.  This place is all about the beverages.  They serve 30 craft beers from local and regional breweries, a list that is forever changing.  They also serve wines by the glass and cocktails.  We came in to enjoy a pizza and decided to share The Carnivore.  The menu description is as follows:  San Marzano tomatoes, house-made sweet and hot Italian sausage, spicy pepperoni, bacon and  house-made mozzarella.  This pizza doesn't really look like much.  But it was super amazing.  The crust was absolutely perfect.  Just the right amount of chewy goodness.  The Italian sausage is out of this world.  Perfect in every way.  Just the right amount of spicy hotness.  The pepperoni, bacon and cheese were all very good.  Perfectly seasoned, cooked just right.  BJ said it best.  \"Jules, this is the best pizza that I have ever had\".  We didn't stop there.  We needed to have dessert.  We shared the cinnamon-almond pizelle cones with vanilla mascarpone, cinnamon apples, and candied walnuts.  It was really good, not overly sweet.  And the perfect dessert for two.  We look forward to our next visit.  Can't wait to try something from their seasonal menu.",

I was immediately turned off by her poor attitude but decided to order anyway, since I had walked all the way over there from my hotel. I ordered a beer and the mushroom pizza (Forrest). No real complaints about the beer, but the pizza was bland and tasteless at best. I was so hungry from traveling all day that I ate what I could and boxed up the rest. I handed the box to a homeless man on the street on my way back to the hotel. I figure that was maybe a little less wasteful since I had originally planned on throwing it away.  1 star for the cute atmosphere. I tried to think of something else positive, but am drawing a blank.   If you're used to food having any type of True flavor, this place is an absolute no. While the atmosphere is kinda cute, the service is bad.   Don't waste your money. Go somewhere else. Your wallet and taste buds may thank me later.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I start every Saturday morning with the food network and this past Saturday, we watched a competition about pizza.  I got the craving and after a bit of research, insisted we do a little date night to Proper Brick Oven.  We didn't end up leaving the house until around 10pm and when I called to make sure the kitchen was still open, I was told their main kitchen was closing in a few minutes, but they would still be slinging pizzas until about 1130.  Perfect.  It was relatively busy as Pittsburgh's Beer Fest as well as the nighttime 5K and the Pickleburgh event had just ended, but we were seated quickly and a waitress was over to get our order.  This is the type of place you want to get at least one pizza per person plus an appetizer.  Their pizzas are 8-count and while it was fine to split for a not-so-heavy meal at 1030pm, for an actual dinner, I could've probably eaten more.    We ordered the seafood pizza and it was amazing.  It wasn't crispy burnt like a lot of other brick oven pizzas I've had.  It was chewy and soft and the crust tasted like a breadstick.  Seriously, really good. I would have definitely tried another pizza as well as maybe one of their salads or the candied bacon everyone raves about, but there will be time for that during our next trip!  For drinks - I ordered the Pittsburgh mule per our waitress' suggestion and my boyfriend ordered his typical pineapple beer.  I am not huge on most craft beers, but their cocktail and wine list looked good.  Our total bill was around $40 for the pizza to split and two drinks.  Not bad for a delicious, quick meal before heading out for some more drinks.  I don't eat pizza often, but when I do - this will be my new go-to!",

The beer selection is good- not excellent (have to head to Fathead's to get A+ beer selection) but the food is really great.   Have to get a wood-fired pizza. Totally excellent. I also really recommend the candy bacon appetizer. Holy god.   I'd go back here in a heart beat.",

    "text": "We went to Proper following a performance at Heinz Hall.  The last place we went to open after a concert was Grit & Grace, which had lead me to believe that the finest dining option open late by Heinz Hall was the 7-11.  Clearly I need to get out more, and I'm sure there many acceptable, and perhaps even excellent options (still need to make it to Meat & Potatoes), but I was relieved to have a good experience at Proper.  By 10 they'd switched to their late night menu, which is just pizza.  I was immediately impressed by the beer selection, which was not overwhelming, but a nicely curated collection.  I ordered the Green Flash, Serrano Chili Double Stout, which was surprisingly delicious.  The cocktails looked like they used quality ingredients, but all appeared to be on the sweet side.  We shared the Forest pizza, laden with mushrooms, fontina cheese, and balsamic drizzle.  The pizza was pretty floppy, in fact soggy from the center to a few inches up each slice. Fortunately, it was still delicious, and the crust was much closer to properly cooked: chewy and flavorful.  Otherwise, our service was fine, the atmosphere relaxed, and the clientele seemed to be mostly young to middle-age professionals.  I'd be happy to return, particularly to try the carnivore pizza, and check out the latest beer offerings.",

The pancetta-wrapped shrimp was amazing, though a small portion. The pizza was delicious, and the crust was just perfect. The drinks, however, were yucky. We got the melon sangria, and sent it back. My husband ordered another drink, the black pepper paloma, and he didn't like it either. The food, though, was excellent and well-priced, and we would definitely return.",

Some colleagues and I did just that on a beautiful day that made the walk over here totally worth it.  Now the pizzas here can be pricey in contrast to what you'd pay at, say, Monte Cellos.  But the sandwiches are comparably priced to any decent restaurant around here.  Actually, what they have here are puccias--homemade stuffed Pugliese sandwich rolls.  I ordered the antipasti puccia, consisting of spicy pepperoni with capicolla and roasted red pepper topped off with smoked mozzarella.  Definitely not something you'd find at Subway!  Proper Brick Oven isn't a place I'd eat at everyday, but it does make for a great occasional treat.  I'm going to someday check out their brunch.",

The personal pizza is off the chain (I had the sopressata which was delish)....the beer selection is on point (probably 30 awesome and unique craft beers on tap)...and the bar servers are knowledgeable about the beer and spirits and are very friendly.  Our bartender Mike was friendly, professional and quicky reccomended a beer pairing which was spot on.    Personal Pizzas are $15-$18.  Beers are in the $6 range.  Well worth it.  If you are in Pittsburgh do not pass this place up.  Highly recommended.",
