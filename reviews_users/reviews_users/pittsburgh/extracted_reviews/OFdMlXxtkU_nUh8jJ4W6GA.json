Everyone that was behind the counter (four dudes) all appeared to be the most miserable coffee shop workers I've seen. There was one man in particular (I won't describe him here) who took my order with the absolute worst attitude! I had no idea why! I wasn't being difficult, the coffee shop wasn't too crazy busy - I tried to overlook it. (maybe he was just having a bad day, right?) But then he proceeded to shoot me and my date absolute DAGGERS the entire time we drank our coffees. And we were sitting on the balcony, by the railing, so that we could look down over top of the counter/main entrance. He was just staring up at us the whole entire time, and it just made me feel so weird. I'm not one to read too much into that kind of thing, but I just got bad vibes from every staff member there. My drink was delicious, but I'll pass on Delanie's from here on out.",

I only frequented Starbucks because I truly LIKED  their coffee, but I don't usually support any corporate businesses. I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! They've done a fantastic job of making it homey, warm and inviting. It's updated and cozy without being at all pretentious. Their coffee is nothing short of amazing. Strong and flavorful, but only because that's what I LIKE. The staff is so attentive that I only had to order once before the dark, longer haired gentleman ( sorry his name escapes me right now, which is awful because he always waits on me and is so friendly) had my preferences memorized. It's worth it to ask about their menu because they'll make whatever you like, however you like it. As a vegan, I was also so impressed to know they  offer many organic, all natural selections as well. I love that they serve fresh pressed juices,too. This is popular in other states because of the health benefits, but not so much in the burgh. They're perfectly sized and convenient and are a great natural substitute to coffee. Juices can provide more energy than caffeine, and I'm glad they realize that. I really have nothing negative to say, here! This establishment is clean, inviting, has fabulous employees, and offers great products all over the board. It's refreshing to leave an establishment with a smile on your face and eager to devour whatever delicious concoction they've made for you. Keep up the good work, Delanies. You'll continue to see me on a daily basis! And your staff ALL deserve gold stars.",

It was pretty busy, but all of the hustle and bustle was contained to the upstairs, which looked like a cool loft area. It wasn't loud either. The first thing I noticed is how high the ceiling was and I loved that. The art on the walls was a delight to look at too.  I ordered something vegan with tofu (I'm not vegan by any means, but wanted to try it), and I got it delivered to me on a plate with two small toasted pieces of bread, lettuce, slices or bell pepper, and warmed tofu. There was something else on the bread that I don't remember, but I was really surprised by how delicious and satisfying this was. I am a fan.  For my drink I got an iced vanilla latte and I have to say it's the best vanilla latte I've had around town. I ended up having two more throughout my time there...I just inhaled them. Seriously..so good. I came back on Sunday and had an iced mocha, which was just as good. This is my new favorite place for real!",

I came with a group of girls and was comfortable staying here all day with yummy snacks every few hours.   While my friend who comes here more often says that the staff is typically great, today was another story. There was one guy behind the counter who was truly rude... He looked at me with absolute disdain. He answered my friendly questions as short as he possibly could. The only effort he put into our interaction was his determination to be as unhelpful as possible.  To give you an idea, we were both so uncomfortable that my friend actually had to walk away and laugh. Later on, both the men's and women's bathroom ran out of toilet paper. My friend let him know, and he told the girls to use napkins. He didn't even check to see if there was more toilet paper in stock. I'm sure there was. This man.   I don't say any of this to advise you not to come! We had a great time otherwise and honestly this provided some laughs. Writing this review was in part necessary to shed the severe discomfort of that situation and in part to let other Delanie customers know that they are not alone. Let your voices be heard! You deserve toilet paper. You deserve to know \"how do you make your smoothies.\" Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise!",

They have a pretty good selection of breakfast sandwiches/brunch type sandwiches for a coffee shop in addition to the typical bagels, muffins, and yogurt. I opted for a brunch type turkey sandwich which was very filling and generous. I almost couldn't finish it so it's a great value for only ~$7. The coffee had a good flavor also. It wasn't too sweet which was great for me. The coffee was smooth and delicious.   I love, love, love the upstairs loft. The upstairs is quiet and away from the noisy streets, but you can still enjoy the view and people watch. Music choice is really soothing - was a very 90s rock when I visited. They have great artworks by local artists for view and for sale.  Delaine's has a great, mellow vibe. Food and coffee are both enjoyable. It's a great place to study, read, or hang out.",

I love the wall seating downstairs, but I would definitely take my friends there if I wanted to host a get-together or work together.  I got their Cold Brew, because it's a staple for me and it was perfect. The next time I am in, I would like to try some of their fresh juices or a blended latte.  I also nommed on a Vegan Pita while I was there, made with sesame ginger tofu, vegetables & Daiya cheese. It's been painfully hard to find places that served vegan cheese so I'm extremely appreciative that they carry it.  I will admit that I was on my way to another coffee shop the day I first discovered Delanie's. I found parking out front of their building (on E Carson WOO!!) and decided to just stop in there and check it out. Delanie's greeted me with delicious smells and the natural light was so inviting, I had to stay. I wound up staying for 5-hours and I don't regret it at all. I got so much work done while they played Hozier in the overhead speakers.  It was such an enjoyable experience, and I will most certainly continue to come back.",

The coffee was great, the food was very delicious (hummus pita, ginger tofu sandwich), and the decor was awesome.  We sat up in the loft.  However, unlike most reviews I read, the barista/staff were not friendly.  It took me a while to figure out how to describe them, and what I finally realized is that they were snobs.  I think they would have been just as happy had we walked out and went to Brueggers instead.",

They serve great coffee here, in addition to wonderful pastries, smoothies, breakfast/lunch sandwiches, cookies, and other related items. There's also a second floor to bring your purchases up to if you're looking for a quieter place to converse or chill out while you enjoy your purchase as the first floor is near the entrance, which tends to have people coming in and out and as such, is more busy in general. Certainly more convenient to get to as it's one of the coffee shops not far from the crossing from Oakland into South Side (Birmingham Bridge). Their smoothies are pretty decent as well. Pastries are also pretty well worth it, too. I do recommend a visit here at least once.",

Once you step in you realize there's seating on the floor for a handful of people and then a cute little loft style area up above that probably seats around 25-30.    The menu is pretty extensive for a coffee shop, with the norms being the espresso based drinks, chai (yay!) and teas.  But they also have a slew of smoothies.  They all looked amazing but I opted for the manager's choice, an amaretto latte.  I'm a sucker for almond, what can I say.  It was perfect to my specifications (skim and extra hot that it burns my tongue slightly).  A smoothie will be saved for another day...don't you worry!  I was interested to hear from chatting a bit with the manager that they're connected with Local.  They receive all their wraps freshly made from the restaurant down the street each morning.  The manager is also a pastry chef and makes delicious looking pastries (which I, sadly, did not partake in after eating a oh so bad for you Chinese lunch!).  I love when places have completely fresh food offerings.  It makes you feel better about purchasing them, in terms of freshness and just supporting local businesses.  I'm excited to make this a regular on my work day coffee shop rotation.  Added bonus, FREE WI F!    OH, and I will be back for you pumpkin scone, be sure of that!",

The grilled cheese is to die for and the various coffee drinks taste like the tears of angels. The service is really good and friendly as well. The ambience is awesome and I love to come here to write papers and just hang out with friends. It's super open with the loft up top and especially when the doors are open, and there is always a cool assortment of art on the walls turning those creative wheels in your head when you have a huge paper due but don't major in English (or have an even more huge paper due and do major in English).  Just try it. You will not regret it. (Fyi Saturday, Sunday afternoons are usually poppin which is nice but also can be hard to find a seat)",

Apparently they didn't have the menus on hand, and one of them rushed out to print them. No apology at all.   On the bright side, the upstairs seating area was really quiet and had plenty seating, making it a great place to do work.

    "text": "I've never really known what the hype is about Delanie's, and I hadn't been in recent years. (From what I've heard they've gotten their act together since they first opened in 2011.)  After a lengthy business meeting that left me starving and in need of caffeine, I decided to stop in and give them another fair shake to see if this place was legit or if it just appeals to those who live nearby and/or college-aged women who get a boost from flirting with the mostly male, hipster staff.   I ordered a cappuccino and a chicken salad sandwich. No frills about the service. No one bothered to recommend anything to someone who was not at all a regular customer or would be familiar with the menu. As some other Yelp reviewers have pointed out, the vibe from the baristas tends to be cold and weird. I've yet to experience the \"class\" and \"friendliness\" that others allegedly have, but I'm sure that does come and go in waves with the moods of the staff.  Really wasn't wild about my coffee even though I wanted to like it. Not sure if it was the roast or what the deal was there for me. I did, however, love my chicken salad sandwich, so kudos to you guys for that. The croissant was warm which made it that much better. It took a long time to come out and almost had to ask where it was as I was drinking my coffee, but good nonetheless.   In terms of atmosphere, it is cool that they have a loft space and exposed brick but I wouldn't prioritize that over the coffee or service. The women's restroom looks like it hasn't been mopped since the day they opened. I consider that likely a byproduct of a mostly young male staff.  Overall verdict: other than the Beehive, there aren't many unique grab-and-go lunch spots or coffee shops in the South Side and so I see the appeal and convenience of going there from that perspective. However, compared to other coffee shops in the city, I wouldn't be jonesing to get down to Delanie's if I wasn't already in the South Side. In terms of coffee shops in other cities, I definitely don't consider them to be running with the big dogs.",

    "text": "I stopped in with CM on Tues. for some beverages and conversation.  We originally came by at 7:30pm hoping to try one of the breakfast sandwiches, since CM was hungry and I'd read good things about them from other reviews.  The barista apologetically informed us that they turn off the oven at 7pm (apparently, it takes a long time to cool down), and suggested Carson St. Deli a couple blocks down as an alternative.  We followed his advice, and then returned at around 8 to have the drinks we'd originally been planning on getting at Delanie's.  Since I hadn't had dessert, I had to try the turtle latte ($4.50).  Rather than being a True latte, this drink is a milkshake-like drink with chocolate and caramel syrups, as well as real peanut butter, smoothie powder, and some espresso.  It's served cold, rather than hot, which the barista explained is because the peanut butter won't incorporate into the drink otherwise.  Although the drink involves sweet ingredients, it isn't overly sugary due to the espresso and lack of ice cream--it's what you might call a well-balanced dessert-y drink.  In terms of consistency, it's thicker than a frozen coffee, but not as thick as a milkshake.  If you're looking for a milkshake alternative, or something like an iced coffee but sweeter, I'd highly recommend trying it!  Rather than going with his preferred coffee shop drink, a cafe au lait, CM decided to break the mold and try an espresso con panna ($1.50).  This is a standard espresso shot topped with fresh whipped cream (not the commercial stuff from a can).  CM was quite pleased with this drink.  Even though I normally shy away from straight espresso shots due to their bitterness, which I'm sensitive to, I tried a sip, and was favorably impressed.  The whipped cream helped cut the espresso, giving it a pleasant fluffy texture as well as a nice flavor balance, making for a unique drink.  Service from the barista was incredibly friendly and helpful (thanks for recommending the deli!), and quite efficient as well.  The ambiance is very appropriate for a coffee shop, with art from local artists hanging on walls of exposed brick.  We sat up in the upstairs loft, which provided a great view, but also felt self-contained and cozy.  Overall, we were very pleased with our experience at Delanie's, despite the unavailability of the breakfast sandwiches which we'd hoped to try (we'll have to return another time to try them!)  In my view, Delanie's is definitely the best establishment of AMPD Group, which also owns several restaurants and bars around town, including Local Bar + Kitchen, Ten Penny, and Steel Cactus.  If you happen to be on the South Side, check it out--you won't be disappointed!  4.5 stars.",

The atmosphere is fine, though the few times I've been there, the music has been on pretty loudly (like I feel the beats going through my body). It was 90 degrees out the other day, and the store front was open and the store had fans, but the back of my legs were sweaty. Also, if you sit there long enough, you will smell like breakfast sandwiches, which may be a plus or minus.",

The prices are right on par with any of the other coffee shops lattes. I was a little overwhelmed with the options when I walked in. All the usual coffee shop drinks plus all sorts of smoothies. The food looked amazing too.   I need to go back again to try something other than my standard and a pastry.   It really is the picture perfect space to spend a cool rainy fall day. The music was low and the lighting is indirect with lots of natural light coming through the windows in the front. They have large soft chairs that are low to the ground and very welcoming. I didn't get to venture upstairs but I could see they did make use of the loft area that space offered.  I very much recommend this as a great alternative to chain coffee spots.

We went on a nice sunny Wednesday afternoon and it was *packed*. Packed as in we walked in and there were no tables to sit so we decided to walk around for a bit then come back. I was happy to see more tables opened up by the time we came back. Although it's located right on the main road of South Side but atmosphere inside was very nice and chill.   It was too warm to get a hot drink so we both went for a peach green tea & a mixed berry smoothie. So refreshing! I also tried their turkey club sandwich on a croissant. So. Delicious! I've had quite a few turkey sandwiches around town throughout the years and I have to admit - this is easily one of the best I've ever eaten. My friend got hungry watching me devoured my sandwich so she went ahead and ordered their chicken salad sandwich which she liked very much too. They also have some fresh pastries like donuts, cookies, brownies too.   Overall, this place is a thumbs up for me; I can see myself going back to Delanie's quite often now to get some work done, meet up with a friend, read a book or if I'm in the mood for their sandwich!",

However, while ordering they were out of many things. I tried getting their banana strawberry smoothie, they were out of bananas. I tried ordering their yogurt which has berries and granola in it, and they were out of both. My friend tried making her own breakfast sandwich and they were out of bacon. Even the homemade juice had very limited options and they are known for it.   Overall it looked super cute inside to do homework or catch up with friends. But they need to try harder to keep their food stocked.",

I got bacon, egg, gouda, and roasted red pepper on a bagel. It was a pretty good sandwich in general. I don't think the bagel was the best, but I am picky about bagels. It was too soft and just wasn't a real bagel to me. Next time I'd just get a different type of bread, but I liked that I could get other toppings on my sandwich.  This was the cheapest cold brew coffee I've ever seen. $2.75 for a 16 oz. And it was good coffee. I'd definitely grab some again next time I'm in Southside, or would want to try one of their espresso drinks too.  I thought the space was really cute. I loved the loft seating. And they had a lot of art for sale on the walls, which was awesome. The only bad part was that when I was there, it seemed really noisy. I think a lot of people got smoothies when I was there. So not somewhere I could sit and work for too long, but worth going to.",

When my friend and I got to the door, we thought they were closed because the door was stuck shut.  One of the baristas opened the door for us and apologized.  It was super nice of him, as we were about to just walk away.  I ordered the Turtle Latte ($4.50), which was a cold mix of peanut butter, chocolate, caramel, and espresso.  As others have said, this drink is almost like a milkshake but not overpoweringly sweet.  The barista told us this was one of the first drinks he invented when Delanie's started, which was a fun tidbit.  I really enjoyed this drink, and I have never had anything else quite like it.  The shop is really big, but a few more tables would be nice.  We did manage to get a seat; however most everyone was sharing tables.  While my own neighborhood favorite coffee place is Commonplace Coffee, Delanie's is definitly one of the best coffee shops in Pittsburgh and easily the best in the South Side.",

    "text": "Please update your pricing on your display. When I went to check out, the price was more than 50 cents higher than expected because their computer system is current and their board is more than \"2 years\" out of date. How is this fair or accurate? I did not get a warm response when asking about milk alternatives... it seemed to be a hassle for me to want something that costs .75 cents more. You think they would have been happy to tell me their alternatives.  And there was no discount for bringing my own mug. Overall bad experience unfortunately because I live in the southside and would prefer to support local businesses.",

    "text": "I stopped by here earlier today with my wife for our morning coffee.  We decided to head to Delanie's Coffee because it was on the Pittsburgh Coffee Passport.  Located right on E Carson St, it's quite easy to find.  Even though it doesn't look like too much from the outside it's quite nice inside.  It actually has two levels of seating with a bar and a few tables downstairs and then a couple of tables and comfy seats in a loft type area.  The walls are made of brick which gives it a comfortable feel while the lighting is a combination of track lighting and can lights.  They also have photos and artwork on the wall that is for sale. For my coffee on this morning I decided to go with a cappuccino while my wife went with a mocha.  It was not crowded on the morning that we were there and so our coffees were ready quickly and we headed upstairs to drink them.  My cappuccino ended up being pretty good.  The coffee flavor of it was nice and smooth without any bitterness.  It was the foam layer here that was interesting as it was quite dense and was more like a bone dry cappuccino than any other I have had.  Yeah I had to do the Google in order to properly describe it and learned quite a bit.  In any case, it was still enjoyable and my wife enjoyed her mocha as well.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  My coffee was good and I am interested in trying a couple of their $7 Gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches which I only noticed whenever we were close to leaving.",

It looks like the owner is working too. Unless the manager on staff that morning was just very passionate. I love when the owner is there on busy mornings. Wasn't a long wait and it was way easier to get food for brunch as compared to waffles InCaffeinated. We couldn't get in there ever.   They had everything I wanted so I was happy about that. I'm an avid hot tea drinker and the barista asked if I wanted two tea bags in my large hot tea...which was very considerate. Like, I don't think anywhere I've ever been has asked me that. Wayyyyyyyyyy plus! Plus the food was bangin'. They let dogs inside too.",

There's a myriad of good little spots all over the city, but Delanie's stands alone by measure of affable ambiance and savory treats.   Exposed brick, open second-level, bartop, scattered books and newspapers, accompanied with local art pieces and amiable baristas - this place is simply good all-around. There's an environment in Delanie's that somehow simultaneously breeds whatever you need; whether that be a collective community or working in a solitary locus, Delanie's is malleable to what you need.  The coffee, of course, is incredible. It pairs beautifully with anything & everything on the menu - The Devil Wears Gouda is the supreme choice, by my standard; But even the oatmeal topped with fresh fruit and granola is incredible.   I could go on about this place but honestly, you have to try it for yourself.",

My daughter and I decided to check in here for a coffee and a latte. My daughter decided to go with what they call a sweetheart frozen latte with white chocolate and raspberry.  I opted for the brew of the day which was a Brazilian roast.  The place was packed with people and along the walls were various artwork for sale. They have an upstairs area to sit but since we were under time constraints we decided to stay downstairs and enjoy our drinks at a long bar stool. Sandwiches and a couple of sweets are also available for purchase as well as smoothies, hot chocolate, and juices.  My daughter really enjoyed her frozen latte. My coffee was a good medium blend. Was a bit piping hot that I burned my tongue a little. Still you get a lot of bang for your buck. Coffee was very good. Free WiFi is available here for the many I saw working on their laptops. They have a assortment of expressos to choose from.  Makes a great place to unwind while you're in the heart of Southside's business district.",

The coffee is fresh and flavorful, with no bitterness. I am in love with their State Fair Grilled Cheese: Granny apples, cheddar, caramel sauce, pepper bacon, and American on sourdough.   If you can stick around, check out the seating upstairs and you can watch everyone preparing drinks and food below. If stairs aren't your thing, the first couple of seats near the front are great for people-watching, whether or not the garage door is open.   The bathrooms are single stalls and clean.  There is street parking out front on Carson, lot parking a block back, and a healthy ride station in the parking lot too.   I'll always stop past Delanie's if I'm in the area because the staff are so friendly.",

The person in front of us ordered a blended latte and waited 11 minutes. We ordered a vanilla latte, drip coffee, and two grilled cheeses. The wait time was about the same for more items. It made sense for our order but not for the guy in front of us.   Food: they shouldn't be called gourmet grilled cheeses. They are oily pressed paninis with cheese.  I don't mind an oily sandwich, sometimes it just means it's been buttered. In this case, it didn't help with either of the sandwiches (the Gouda and the state fair). The Gouda one was pretty decent and should just be moved over to the sandwich section. The state fair was something my college nephew has made me before from his dorm toaster oven. The cheese wasn't incorporated well with the sandwich (see pics) which I wouldn't expect for something from a grilled cheese menu.   Coffee: unless it's the cold brew, not good. I've had the cold brew from here before and it was decent. The drip coffee, however, was watery, and the vanilla syrup used in the vanilla latte had a plastic aftertaste. For a place that serves specialty drinks, you'd think a three ingredient vanilla latte would be a pleasant experience. Not the case.  Interior: Cute. Clean. Extra seating on the top floor. It's family friendly. There are bathrooms on the bottom floor.",

All the staff I've interacted with have been super friendly and helpful.   One thing that I'm not wild about is the lay out of this location. There's limited sitting on the first floor and not a lot of room upstairs.

    "text": "My friend and I came here in the wintertime during our finals week and I have to say, I have no regrets - even if bussing here from Oakland was a little stressful/time consuming!   This environment has everything I want in a local coffeeshop. The smell of fresh coffee & baked goods. The wooden tables & large windows for natural lighting. The friendly staff & cozy atmosphere. I sat here for hours soaking in the good vibes while cramming for my final.  I like that it closes sorta \"late\" (8pm) for a coffeeshop. I hate when I'm in the zone and I get kicked out of a cafe at 4pm. There's also many restaurants nearby on this street so you can quickly grab a bite and come back for a cup of coffee!  The only down side is that there is limited seating, and not many outlets. So make sure you charge your devices before you camp out here!",

When you work from home in Pittsburgh in January/February it's really cold out! I've tried several coffee shops and always find myself freezing. My favorite place to sit is in the lofts it's always warm and toasty and has a great view of all the art work you'll find.   I love when I find a great spot with excellent staff. Can you ask for anything better? You'll notice they call multiple people by their first name and know orders by heart. They're happy to make recommendations and will go out of their way to make sure your order is just what you wanted.   They menu is robust. I'm talking coffees, teas, juices, smoothies, breakfast sandwiches and grilled cheese. You can stay all day... speaking of all day they're open until 8:00pm. If you have a lot to accomplish, this is the place to do it.",

The day we went was a nice day so they had the garage door style door open and we got a fresh breeze every now and again. We sat upstairs where we ordered coffees and the grilled cheese. The grilled cheese was a little greasy, pretty typical for a grilled cheese but still filling and tasty.  The overall environment of the establishment is welcoming. There are a lot of people on laptops doing work and customers stopping by for a quick drink to add to their day. It is a cute shop to pay a visit to and study for a few hours.",

I got some veggies on it and Gouda and it was truly delicious! My coffee drink I wanted to try one of their specialty drinks but it was only available hot, since it was 70 degrees that day I asked if could have something similar cold and the barista came up with something delicious!

They have a huge selection of drinks from your traditional brewed coffee to frilly frappuccinos. My favorite is their black & gold latte which is one of their specialities.   My biggest complaint has always been their ordering system. I've only been here a handful of times but one thing is always consistent - they always jack up my order! Nothing gets written down so the barista juggling 5 different orders from memory is bound to forget a detail or two. During my last visit, it took 3 attempts and over 20 minutes to get the order right. Someone get them a pen and a pad of paper.",

When I order, it tends to be something \"basic\" like a chai tea latte, smoothie, or hot chocolate (and a sweet snack, of course). So I can't really speak for Delanie's coffee, but I can speak for everything else!   It's a really cozy environment and I really love going on rainy days with the warm lights and exposed brick. But it's also fun to go on nice days when they open the store front windows! They have a little loft which really enhances the coziness. The employees are always so kind and the drinks so tasty. My go-to is, of course, the chai tea. It's a perfect little place in South Side for someone like me, a Pitt student, just ready to get off of campus and study somewhere new. Whether you're studying, working on a personal project, or meeting up with a good friend, you'll be so at peace in this little coffee shop and quickly lose track of time.",

My goto is the iced coffee as I think it's some of the best around. They always have wonderful flavors you can add in to. They also do fun hot drinks to for those that don't do the cold stuff. There's outside seating here and a place to lock up your bicycles not to far down. It can sometimes get a bit crowded but there's always the seating upstairs as well. Overall I'll definitely be continuing to come here because everything well priced and overall a better experience than any of the other coffee shops in the southside I think.",

One was my coffee the other was what I assumed was left-over coffee, a small amount, but in a very nice looking cup. I was told it was \"special\". Ok. I was in a hurry and just grabbed it.  On reflection, I decided that I had been mistreated, maybe cheated. Anyway, a couple of days later I go back. The same barista is there. I explain what happened. He's obliging and offers me another coffee. I put a buck down on the counter to show good faith. He \"pulls\" a coffee and offers it. It looks like leftovers again (no crema, not very hot). I'm not sure my buck ended up in the cash register.  I was not inclined to make a big deal of it (call the manager over, etc) so I just gave up. I won't go there again (there's another quite nice place down the street). And I suggest you avoid this place as well. They don't treat their customers very well.",

First off, I was blown away by the beautiful space, offering tons of seating and lovely views of original artwork along the walls. I got a small table up in the lofted area after I made my order, which consisted of a drip coffee (delicious and full, and only $1 between 7am and 9am on weekdays!) and a made-to-order breakfast sandwich (like as in I watched my eggs being scrambled and cooked) stacked high with fresh spinach and thick-cut bacon. I found myself cursing all the years of school I spent in Pittsburgh without adding Delanie's to my study spot rotation. Delanie's would be equally awesome for a catch-up with a friend in addition to being work-friendly (I easily found an outlet as well as the Wi-Fi password). Highly recommend the trip to the Southside to check out Delanie's!",

They have everything from your basic cup of coffee to more elaborate coffee creations! Now, I'm no connoisseur of coffee, nor do I claim to be, but I really liked the Vanilla Latte that I had chosen--in fact, I had 2!  What I do know, however, is food! Delanie's was pumping out some very tasty little treats! Pumpkin Cheesecake that was moist, flavorful and beautiful--yes, beautiful!! They also make cookies that are amazing and perfect; huge chocolate chip cookies that are as big as your head!  The other thing that I \"know\" is service and the folks here were very nice, moved with urgency, and were not put out by accommodating any special requests from guests.  I would most definitely stop in again and recommend Delanie's Coffee to friends!  [damnit, I didn't have to use the bathroom and totally forgot to, at least, check it out!

Just hearing her describe the layout of the place (stairs that lead to open seats and a view of the shop) piqued my interest. Since it was only a 15 minute bus drive from Pitt, I went on the same day I talked with my friend. The verdict: Absolutely loved the drink and the ambiance! Definitely one of the best chai tea lattes I've ever had. Next time I'll be back to try their vegan sandwich.",

But I am a lady of my word...  I don't eat or drink a lot of dairy these days so I am hugely grateful to find a coffee shop that offers not only soy milk, but my personal favorite replacement, almond milk.  The friendly hippie hipster hatted gentleman at the counter was a delight, and we bonded over our shared love of the music he was playing, Bird and the Bee (catchy stuff: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FTMy6X5cQul8&s=a80a134cb450c170a73d81792c0d9601285929adf97c489740e1bdffda27b0e5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/TMy6X5cQul8</a>).  My black and white mocha with almond milk was so sweet and delicious.  My friend asked for a mocha with extra espresso, and wow, did he ever listen - that'll put some hair on your chest!  She was thrilled, of course.  The food looks tasty, the space is full of beautiful details, overall, a marvelous experience.",

I stopped for a to-go cup so I could enjoy a non-snowy day walking around South Side while waiting for a group for lunch.  The barista was pleasant (and didn't show annoyance when I changed my order from \"for here\" to \"to go;\" though he hadn't actually poured anything, he did need to wash cups for us).  The atmosphere was calm even though it was semi-busy.  It looks like a great place to stay and work on your laptop or study with plenty of tables and chairs available.  The coffee, a Costa Rican that day I believe was very tasty.  I would have liked something a little deeper, but it was mellow and fresh (and not burned...ahem, you know who you are, chain coffee guys!)  I would love to try some of their lattes - the menu is plentiful and interesting.  I had a sample of a mocha brownie and would love a full version of their pastries, too.",

Some so good I've made a second stop as I walked Carson St. going some place else, just to get more.      I haven't tried the coffee here since it raises my blood pressure but let me tell you, they look so good. I think I gain a pound watching someone else get their coffee last year. It was so tempting.      This year I stopped in after a nice steak dinner wanting something sweet and sort of healthy. Or at least not entirely bad for me. I saw these lovely Oatmeal cookies with sweet creme in the middle. I took it back to the hotel and I was ready to enjoy it in a few bites with some milk. I was very disappointed to find it had coffee in it. So much it over powered the creme and cookie. Which was a big bummer. I was even more displeased to think the sales person neglected to mention it. It's the first time it's happened and it will remind me to ask next time.      Don't let this mishap keep you from enjoying a coffee and sweets. Everything here is fresh and made very well. Some are almost to decadent to eat but I would still eat them if I were you. Just ask if it has coffee in it.      There is also some fantastic art on the walls to view and buy if your so inclined. Unfortunately none of the art is mine.",

They have artwork hanging up on the walls done by local artists that are for sale so the artwork never stays the same.  The baristas are friendly and polite; you can tell they really care about the impression customers have of their coffee shop!   What I like most about Delaine's is that there are two floors.

I had the matcha latte but it was too sweet for me. They have a nice upstairs and it's a good place to catch up with friends, do some work, or read a book. Very chill atmosphere & free wifi (:",

The store offers a lot of gluten free pastry options which is nice. All in all, Delanie's has a nice atmosphere. The biggest perk is probably the huge open window, great for feeling a summer breeze.",

    "text": "Delanie's is my new favorite coffee place, which says something because I have so many in Pittsburgh. A few times a week, I like to walk a few blocks and have a coffee at their nice cafe on Carson.   The staff is always friendly.  The coffee is good, but the breakfast sandwiches are better. I love breakfast. I could eat brinner every night. That being said, their veggie, egg, and cheese sandwich is one of the freshest I've ever had.   Be warned, a few of their frozen drinks taste more like milkshakes than your run-of-the-mill iced coffee. If you fancy a treat, try the \"turtle\", a sweet frozen concoction of peanut butter, chocolate, and caramel.  It's not a bad place for a meetup, a break, or just somewhere to read/work for awhile.  If you're a regular, it's worthwhile to join their loyalty program. You will quickly accumulate free drinks!",
