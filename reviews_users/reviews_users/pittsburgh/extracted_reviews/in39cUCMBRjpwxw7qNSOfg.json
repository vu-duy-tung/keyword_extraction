The food came out quick and the tacos are decent in size (2-3 are plenty per person). The JuJu shell is a must-try. A soft shell/hard shell combo with melted cheese and chorizo between the layers. Game-changer. Overall, the atmosphere is great and inviting and the service is top-notch. Definitely one of the best taco joints in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "A solid bar with very okay tacos.   I've tried Condado three times now (first time at the Lawrenceville location). They have a wide list of margarita options and beers on tap. As for the menu, you can choose from a create your own adventure taco to their signature pre-designed options. Their tacos are definitely more of a tex-mex style with flour tortillas and shredded cheddar cheese. Compared to some of the best taco places such as Edgar's or Las Palmas, taste and quality wise Condado doesn't come close. Compared to Bakersfield which boasts a similar vibe and menu, I prefer Bakersfield tacos, apps, and drinks overall.   Stop here if you want to munch on some nachos or guac with your drink, otherwise these aren't the tacos you're looking for.",

    "text": "Okay. I originally gave this place a 4 star review but have to knock it down for several reasons.   1. I actually hate (HATE) the seating arrangements. It's so cramped and I don't want to sit at the same table as random people, especially when I can't even hear the person across from me because the music is so loud and I have people I'm touching elbows with also screaming.   2. Our waitress sucked. She didn't bring water until we were signing our checks and didn't check on us the entire night, but made sure to check on the bros sitting next to us who were flirting with her several times. I got the tres amigos dip trio that came with salsa the last two times I ordered it and didn't this time. When I asked her about it she just said \"oh it's complimentary so sometimes you don't get it\" what???  3. The food isn't good. Seriously, if you want real tacos with good ingredients and good service, I highly recommend Baby Loves Tacos up the hill in Bloomfield!",

The taco sheet is fairly easy to follow, you can make your selections from each category, and there is quite a big selection of options for any picky eaters. And the pitchers of margaritas are very convenient for larger groups. The only weird thing consistent among the condado's that I have been in is that the seating is crowded, and happy hour only goes on in the front room.",

The music is loud and the seating is communal style so everyone is kind of on top of each other and that makes it even louder. There was a table between us and the entrance though even so every time someone came in (which was often), we were hit with a blast of cold air. Later we found out as we were leaving the outer door of the vestibule was propped open... kind of strange given that it was in the high 30s outside. Bring a coat in case they seat you near the door. Lots of great options on the menu. We wanted the pineapple salsa to start but they were out of it so we got the corn salsa instead, it was great. Their chips are great too. The wait was pretty long for the tacos. The Lucy's Fire was fantastic, I'd recommend it. I also had El Tracional and Bubba Kush, both were fine with preference towards the latter. The tacos are sizable, after chips and salsa I was only able to eat two. Worth checking this place out for sure.",

The last couple of times I have been there with friends our build-your-own tacos came with so little filling that it felt like a rip off. I regret not taking pictures. The tortillas are small and yet you can wrap the taco like a burrito. They are even double layered to prevent the taco to break, although I suspect the real purpose here is completely different. The first time we let it go and blamed it to maybe someone new in the kitchen, but twice in a row it is definitely a business plan so we agree we won't be coming back. If you need to cut costs do it somewhere else but don't mess with the food, or increase the price a bit. Although $9 for two tacos is not super cheap either. Cantina for example charges $1-$2 more per taco but you actually get to eat a meal not just a bunch of cheap corn.",

It's really loud in here and it makes it super hard to even talk to the person next to you.  I also wasn't a fan of the artwork that included a scantily clad woman with avocados on her top in just the right place to indicate what exactly was underneath. I'm not against that type of artwork but it just felt like they were trying super hard to be, I don't know, cool? So again, maybe I'm just getting too old.  The service, though, was 5 stars.  Our waitress was helpful, friendly, and she seemed to enjoy working there which makes it easier to ask questions when you're new to a restaurant.  Food also comes out rather quickly.  We did go on a Saturday evening when it was crowded and were told they didn't know how long it would take but they would text us.  We went across the street to grab a drink and as we received our drinks, were told our table was ready.  We quickly went back but were informed that because we didn't text back within ten minutes (we arrived in 8 minutes of the text) they had given our table away. So if you do this option, definitely text back or your table will be given to the next party.  I rated a three because I think it's definitely a place you need to try out for yourself.",

Their queso is one of my favorites as it is the perfect dipping consistency and doesn't taste artificial. We could have used a refill of chips, but I don't think our waitress noticed. Despite it being pretty busy, we got our tacos fast. The tacos were delicious as usual. I love their chorizo as it is quite flavorful. The prices are so reasonable, as you can fill up the tacos with an unlimited amount of toppings, cheese, and sauces. My only complaint would be that the tables are a bit tight.

I have high hopes for this establishment  -- a meal here with drinks will give you the same hip and fun experience as other bars on Butler but at the fraction of the cost. Furthermore, their happy hour goes until the much more reasonable hour of 7pm (unlike Smoke or Merchant down the street). For these reasons, I can definitely see myself coming here for a drink and perhaps a small bite or two.   Their tacos are customizable, which is a big plus, but I still think a general problem for this chain is the temperature of the food. The tortillas are consistently cold or room temp and the protein slightly warm. I understand they have to crank out a lot of tacos, especially during happy hour but I think serving slightly warmer food will really enhance the flavor of the tacos and make for an overall better experience.   The art is amazing and the staff is extremely enthusiastic and welcoming. I'm glad they came to Lawrenceville!",

Since opening in Lawrenceville, our family has been getting tacos to go and eating at the restaurant multiple times throughout the week.  We never get bored with the menu.   The take out service is amazingly fast. Which is great for a family like ours.  I have two young children who are picky eaters. They love being able to pick exactly what they like on their taco. I like that I can order and am able to pick up lunch or dinner for my family 15 minutes later. And everyone will be very happy with the high quality meat, cheese, vegetables, beans, and grains that are in these delicious tacos.   I also am pleased with the interior provisions that the restaurant has. All members of the neighborhood to enjoy dining there. A changing station is located in the upstairs restroom and high chairs are available.  The downstairs and reserved side room are great areas to dine for families and mature neighbors.  The staff and management are warm and upbeat. While all of the establishment is decorated with a fun vibe that is clean and sparkling.   Finding your favorite meal might be the only difficulty! The food is really good and I suggest being adventurous. Try many items over several visits.  Two tacos fill me up. Our family typically also splits an order of nachos loaded with every kind of cheese available, chicken, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, corn salsa, green salsa, and guacamole. They're delicious. And big enough for 2 kids and 2 adults to pick at as a side!",

    "text": "My husband and I tried Condado Tacos for the first time last night after hearing wonderful things about this new amazing restaurant. And let's just say it definitely did not disappoint and we are already planning on returning this week to try some more of their crafted tacos. We were able to customize our own tacos to try multiple combinations as well as try some taco suggestions. I tried their taco if the month which was a Burger and Fries taco. Delicious. In addition to making my own. Fresh, well seasoned ingredients made for the best tacos we've had. We even had the choice of several shells that are unique to Condado. My husband loved the spicy hard corn and the JuJu that was a combo of hard and soft filled with more goodies. And don't forget about the cheesy white queso that left us regretting only ordering a half portion. Again-delicious. So if you are looking for great service with extremely tasty food and drinks, you should give Condado a try. It will not disappoint!!!",

Tacos are much larger than every other taco establishment I have visited in the city. They include a lot of meat, and the sauces are delicious.  The shells are very fresh, and some have a delicious soft/hard shell combo.   The value here is excellent. My wife and I each had a draft Mex beer, a taco, and shared some chips and wonderfully  spicy homemade salsa. Our bill was something like $19.50. Try pulling that off at other nearby establishments!  The bar is decorated with funky murals. Staff is pleasant if not super chatty/friendly. We have decided to make this our new go-to spot for semi-regular, solid value outings.",

I waited a while, and asked if I could cancel the order if it hadn't been started because I had people not getting good waiting in the car. The hostess got a manager, who went in the back to do something. I then got a text saying my order was ready. I thought he was going to bring out my food, but no. Ultimately I waited over an hour, to leave with no food. I was given a gift card for another time, but I am here on vacation and live 9 hours away, so I will never be able to use the gift card. The staff kept telling me the kitchen was 30 minutes behind, which I understand, but there were 5 take out orders being waited for, and they were not even started.",

I'll keep my $3 Las Palmas tacos with hot, fresh proteins and their self serve topping bar from now on.    Much better/bigger bang for the buck.",

Our waiter was a very talkative fellow, and while pleasant, didn't seem to understand when he was crossing the line from interestingly sociable to downright annoying.   The artwork and ambiance is quite different from what I was expecting. This place is every bit what Lawrenceville is trying to be. It's trying to pull off an effortless sort of cool that is honestly kind of tacky-- it's all too bright, too loud, too much. I did like the small, communal tables, though. It adds a touch of intimacy to an otherwise painfully self-aware establishment.   The food definitely made it worth the chatter. The nachos I ordered came piled high with chicken, cabbage slaw, salsa, and this incredible cheese sauce (annoyed because I can't quite remember the name). It was delicious and my only critique would be to add more of that wonderful cheesy goodness. I also grabbed a few jackfruit tacos and was pleased by them as well!   Altogether, it was a good time and the food is probably what will bring me back here.",

I like the make-your-own options for the tacos, but honestly, I always go with the suggested tacos, because I could never come up with a taco as creative as those can be, or as delicious. Also, I highly recommend the elote queso. *chef's kiss*",

Fusion street style tacos are our thing. We liked the preset taco options there were 3 vegetarian ones we tried 2 of them. My husband loved the pulled jackfruit one and I loved the mushroom one. Was perfect. Chilli tofu was okay. Just dry and lacked flavour. The sauce options are amazing. Love it. I think it was slightly on the expensive side. So I would suggest to go during happy hour as the tacos are $1 cheaper. They have some specials during July month which looked good but there wasn't any vegetarian options in that. Also we got a side of guacamole and rice and it wasn't anything special.",

We only had a 5-minute wait until something opened up. We could have been seated immediately downstairs, but then the happy hour specials (1/2 off house margaritas, $1 off tacos) don't apply. Happy Hour is 5-7 pm. The jalapeno margarita was outstanding! We ordered the Tres Amigos and got blanco dip, chorizo dip, and pineapple salsa.  Tacos are MTO - you fill out a sheet and select all of the fillings/toppings/sauces that you want. I ordered chorizo and pork tacos on soft tortillas, and both were excellent. They made a simple cheese quesadilla for my daughter (off menu) and she was thrilled. Our service was really good despite the restaurant being absolutely packed.  Highly recommend!!!",

    "text": "I love Condado - it's one of my favorite places to grab a bite to eat. The chips are bottomless, the taco's are highly customizable, the margaritas are some of the best in the city, and everything is reasonably priced. Not to mention, Condado is allergy and vegan friendly! I honestly didn't think Condado could get much better until I visited the Lawrenceville stop. The interior is beautiful with great lighting. You don't feel too close to other people even when the restaurant gets busy (which I found in other locations). Not to mention, the wait staff is excellent. I 100% recommend Condado to anyone looking for a good taco or an excellent happy hour! Side note: if you come around peak hours, there will likely be a wait.",

    "text": "Condado is probably my favorite place to get tacos in Pittsburgh. They're build-your-own style is so much fun and the food is AMAZING. Happy hour is a great deal, half of marg's and dollar of tacos.. wow!  My boyfriend and I took advantage of the happy hour specials and each got a strawberry margarita. They only serve them on the rocks, which is preferable for me but not him, however they were a good balance of fruit and tequila tastes.   We then ordered the blanco queso. It was fantastic, and comes with endless chips (if it can last that long...). We each opted to create our own tacos and were incredibly satisfied by the size and flavor of them. The set-up of the Lawrenceville location is really nice.. it allows for more comfortable seating and it's a lot quieter than the downtown location. There is also more space so less of a wait.   Overall, honestly might be my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.",

Tacos weren't that cheap, albeit was cool they were 'build your own' style. I also wasn't particularly surprised by anything, and the dips are pretty pricy. Parking (street parking) is pretty much near impossible to find on a busy weeknight or weekend.   The good news is you can join the waitlist from yelp! The bad news is that sometimes it's pretty inaccurate. I was 'late' for my spot and found there were still parties ahead of me who haven't even been seated yet.",

    "text": "I stopped by here yesterday with my wife for lunch.  We had both been past Candado Tacos before and so decided to head over here whenever we had time for a Sunday brunch.  The inside of this restaurant is sort of deceiving as the area you walk into is the bar area which also has a ton of high top tables.  As we walked in I was hoping that they had enough room to seat us but I shouldn't have been worried as they have another dining room down a hallway.  This room was decorated with a mural (like most of the restaurant) that was soothing with its purples and blues.  For lunch on this day my wife and I decided to start off our meal by splitting the pineapple guacamole.  It came out somewhat quickly and was really good.  The tortilla chips were clearly homemade and tasted quite nicely.  Meanwhile the guacamole had a good consistency and flavor to it which I think was helped by the sweetness of the pineapple.  Then for my entree I decided to make four of my tacos which would end up being entirely too much food for me.  In any case for my first taco I went with a firecracker shell with Thai Chile tofu, fajita peppers, lettuce and chihuahua cheese.  Taco number two was a flour tortilla with bbq jackfruit, jicama and cabbage slaw, queso fresco and corn salsa.  For my third taco I chose the  shrimp ceviche on a flour tortilla with fajita peppers, the smoked cheddar, pineapple salsa and Mexican chimmichurri.  Then my last taco consisted of the fire cracker shell with ghost pepper marinated skirt steak, jicama and cabbage slaw, queso fresco, salsa verde and cilantro lime aoili.  On the side of all of this i got their three hottest sauces: mango haberneo, candado secret taco sauce and dirty sauce.  Now if you made it through all of that I imagine you realize I had a ton going on with each of the tacos.  So let me say that I enjoyed each in their own way but I think that the steak one with the firecracker shell and the jicama slaw was my favorite.  Out of the sauces I really enjoyed the Mexican chimichurri as well as the dirty sauce, the latter of which i put on everything.  At only $3.50 for each of them I thought it was a good price and as mentioned before I was only able to eat two of them at Condado and finished the last two at home later that night.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Condado has a huge list of ingredients to make your tacos from and if you don't want to do that, you can choose from some premade ones as well.  Both our guacamole and the tacos were good and I look forward to patronizing this business again.",

We were so pleased with the food that we actually visited twice during the few days we were there! We chose to sit inside the first time and that was a mistake. It was extremely loud and crowded. You are sat at long tables with other people and you could not hear the person across the table. We created our own tacos and they came out in a decent time. The tacos were delicious. Definitely the best tacos we have ever had! The second time we went, we chose to sit outside where it was not loud. The only thing was the waitress took awhile to come out to take our orders and we never got drink refills. But because the food tasted fresh and flavorful we would recommend this place to anyone! Get the JU JU taco!",

The decor was fitting and apparently all of the artwork is done by local artists, which I love! The atmosphere is loud and hip, a lot of young people chowing down on tacos. We were seated in the downstairs part, which we didn't mind. However, the one thing I didn't like is the way the tables are set up. We shared the table with another couple and I just thought they were a little close to us, but it wasn't a huge problem!  The Happy Hour is by the far the best part, $1 off tacos and cheap margaritas, you can't beat that! I definitely recommend going during this time because you get the most for your buck.   As for taco recommendations, if you like pulled pork, the Bubba Kush is the way to go.",

My group reserved a table about 30 minutes in advance of arriving. It really helped with the wait time.  It's been a while since I've been to Codado but was pleasantly surprised to see they added eggs and bacon to the menu. Breakfast tacos whenever you want. (Of course that's what I had to order).   I'd also highly recommend the Banana margarita. A friend recommended it a while back and I'm hooked.",

    "text": "I soooooo want to give this place 5 stars, but there is a very important reason why I didn't.  It's the ordering / variety of their \"build your own\" style of menu. While some diners may love 48,000 degrees of freedom, I'm often perplexed with menus that are seemingly like something Willy Wonka would put together.  Clearly, this style of menu and ordering works well and the chain is successful - we'll be back, of course, but it was taxing in a loud, colorful space with my whole family looking at me to help them build their tacos. In the end, everything was SUPER tasty and very fresh, so it was time well-spent, but for those 10 minutes, it was stressful!  Our waitress downstairs (they have seating in the basement) was exceptional, and really made the effort to streamline things and help get us settled in. They have a gargantuan drink menu as well, so be ready to sift through that!  Chips were delicious. Perhaps TOO delicious, as they fill you up while noshing on their \"guac of the day\" whilst filling out your taco ticket. Salsa was on-point, too.  Tacos were great - chicken and pork carnitas were good choices, and I loved the shrimp ceviche, but lamented the miserable paucity of shrimp in my taco - I'd rather be charged more and get more for a more expensive ingredient than have a teeny tiny teaser of a sample hidden in my taco!  OK, I hope you kept reading, because the bottom line for this place is that it is an amazing place to come and get some absolutely delicious street tacos with top notch ingredients and lightning fast service. Even with all of my micro-dissection of our experience above, we WILL be coming back for more, and very often!!! I'm sure next time, I'll bump it up a star... once I get used to that dizzying taco ticket, that is.",

Their margarita flights are what keeps me coming back. I have tried the chicken, beef and shrimp. The shrimp is the only meat that had flavor and only because it taste like shrimp...  The taco shell to get is the combo one of hard and soft shell- game changer. Also their guacamole and salsa options are pretty tasty. Some are a little strange- one of the guacamole's has grilled peaches in it. Worth a try but wouldn't go back just to try that.   Fun for a good night out with cheap food (each taco is like $3-4) but I would not recommend if you want to be overwhelmed by taste.",

    "text": "While I was sad to see Tender Bar close, this was one of a few spots that I couldn't get mad about opening up in it's place. The downtown Condado was a new favorite hangout of mine and it was nice to see a second option appear close by. For the record, I can't find any discernable difference between the two locations, but maybe someone can correct me if that isn't the case.  It's a trendy place, dimly lit, with a Mexican Day of the Dead theme and decor to match. Two floors of seating. It always feels decently crowded, but I've never waited long for a table.  For your tacos, if you've been to Burgatory, it's the same setup. You get a checklist and make a completely custom order. There are numerous options for your choice of protein, toppings, cheeses, sauces, salsa, and even down to the shell itself. Chorizo and ghost pepper marinated steak tend to be my favorites. The guacamole and queso are worth ordering to share at the table and other sides are available as well. They have all your basic Mexican and domestic beers by the bottle and draft, with a few crafts on tap also. Several options for margaritas (even by the flight), specialty cocktails, and a good selection of tequila and mezcal round out the drink choices.  This place is hip and contemporary but still very casual. I know I can come here for good tacos and the complete customization aspect means I'll never get tired of the choices. That's what keeps me coming back.",

It could be perfect for a party or company gathering. These tacos never disappoint. I love trying the different proteins and cheeses. The queso blanco is delicious if you want to be the odd person out and just get chips and queso. I fully recommend the margarita flight. If you're like me, you easily get bored with the same flavor of margarita after awhile. With the flight, you can choose 3 flavors. I never had a banana margarita before and it was actually pretty good! In short, the tacos are great. The space is awesome. The staff is friendly. Go here. Now.",

Corn tortillas are dry as hell. They need to be warmed up on a flat top or cooked fresh. All of the tacos we have were a bit watery.

After two or three bites, I was DYING. So spicy I couldn't breathe. Sweating, nose running, etc. Wouldn't go away even with guac, a marg, and two full glasses of water. The kicker? I have stomach ulcers that make eating spicy food completely unbearable for days. I only had a few bites before the burn, but this could make someone (me) really sick not knowing what they're signing up for.

However the prices are reflective in the quality of the food. Looks can be deceiving. I've eaten here several times now and love the ambiance, wait staff, and drink selection, but the food doesn't do it for me. Watch what toppings you request because I've have food served to me cold as ice, with the waitress just saying it's the chilled toppings. Recently the tofu bowl came out as if ordered from a kid's menu, miniature sized, with two pieces of tofu and browned lettuce. They do have a ton of vegan and vegetarian options, jackfruit, portabella mushrooms, and tofu to name a few. Be mindful if you order chips & dips they'll top the salsas with cream or cheese. Great spot for happy hours (only select floors of the restaurants) or late night food given their kitchen is open late. These restaurants drawn insane crowds!

It's in the hip part of town with a small pay parking lot next door. Very convenient.  The decor is urban, bright and fun. I love it.  The tables are family style. All high tops. Its cramped. No place to hang your coat or put your gloves. I do love that they have plenty of small hooks to hang your purse and scarf.  The staff is a mixed bag. Love the bar staff and host was lit.  Our server was lame as hell. I asked for more details on the taco of the month, the Thanksgiving taco.  He told me it was like Thanksgiving dinner in a shell.  I have no idea if the Thanksgiving dinner included mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, gravy.  So I moved on and asked about the California roll guac. He told me it was basically like a California role in guac.  No shit sherlock...can you elaborate a bit? Or even tell me of its awesome. Lol. I was gonna ask about the grilled cheese queso and the blueberry maple margarita but I learned my lesson.  We got queso dip and chips. The dip was good. See the pix of the chips. The sheen is from the oil. You can just guess how well the salt stuck to the chips....it was kinda gross.   My dirty something taco- one the suggestions menu- was great.  Absolutely a highlight.  I took a gamble with the egg taco.  It was hella bland. A total low.. Finally I got the skinny skeleton. It was just okay. Not worth the 8 bones. The place was packed. Had a good enough vibe. You might like it. I wont likely go back any time soon. Too many other superior choices..",

Their prices are affordable, and there are pretty much unlimited toppings. I love the other location downtown, but this location is nice as well. There is a parking lot right next door, and on street parking as well.",

We ordered over $40 dollars worth of tacos for 2 people. Ha! I got the veg ones: the thai tofu and the bbq jackfruit. We also got some from the suggested menu like the ooey gooey and others I can't remember, but I know one had a flavored/red shell! All I know is that the flavors melded together perfectly. There wasn't a bad taco. Well, we did get the taco of the day which we didn't realize was going to be a nod to Thanksgiving. I bet it was good but neither one of us wanted to try it.   We had leftovers and they were STILL delicious a couple days later. The side of rice and beans was not huge but just right for $1.   These tacos are not similar to authentic Mexican cuisine, with hard corn tortillas and soft flour tortillas as your only options (well, that along with fancy selections that sure as heck aren't authentic).  But with all of that being said, they are so delicious. And this Mexican gal can't stop thinking about them! Seriously I already asked my coworker if we can go back again soon.   The ambiance is cool to boot! Def worth a stop. Maybe next time I can sample some bevvies :)",

    "text": "Stopped over here for lunch since I was in a hurry. I was glad to see it is located right across the street from the metered parking lot on Butler St.  A very nice waitress explained the concept to me. I could either choose from the premade tacos or build my own. They also feature what they call the taco of the month. You place your name on a sheet indicate quantity and if you are building your own then you would indicate what you want on your taco.  I did notice they have some vegetarian tacos here. They can be made vegan upon request. I decided to order two \"Dutch dragon\" tacos but without the hard shell. The fast casual restaurant has long tables where more than one party can sit at and a full service bar.  At the end of each table is a roll of brown paper towels-believe me you will need them! I had my tacos within 5 minutes flat and as I starting eating they got very messy. The Dutch dragon taco is consists of guacamole, roasted portabellos, tomatoes, jicama/cabbage slaw, jalepeno's, corn salsa, and salsa verde all on a soft taco shell.  I must say they were good but those jalepeno's sure had a kick to them. The order is served in one of the paper food holders and your only utensil is a plastic spoon/fork mix. That item is not very good at scooping up the drippings that fall out of them.  Condado's has a full bar with TV off to the left side of the entrance. Their wallpaper and layout is truly a Mexican influence.  Service is fast and my waitress they brought my check quickly so I could finish up. This is their 2nd location with the first one still in downtown Pittsburgh. I definitely suggest bring a wet nap because I went through tons of paper towels just to clean my fingers and hands. Overall the food was good. Prices are very reasonable especially if you aren't ordering that much. A welcome addition to Lawrenceville.",

    "text": "I finally made my way to Condado, so I figured I better make my way here to taco 'bout it.  I came here for dinner with a relative and when we arrived, the hostess provided a few options: we could put our name on the list for a table in the front bar/dining area to reap the happy hour benefits (pro tip: they're on NoWait!), grab seats at the bar for the same perks, or be seated right away in the other dining area sans happy hour specials.  Loving a good happy hour as much as the next person, we decided to put our names down and belly up to the bar in the meantime.  One jalapeno margarita and order of guacamole later, our table was ready.    The majority of the seating in the front bar is communal and I've noticed this becoming more and more popular at restaurants  around the city. I didn't find any issue with it during my visit, though I can imagine it may get cramped when they are at capacity.  Our waitress was attentive and helpful in answering our menu questions and she was very patient as we spent a good chunk of time chatting before being ready to place our orders on a sheet that took me back to the days of high school Scantron exams.  For my tacos, I ordered the shrimp ceviche and ghost pepper steak, both on flour tortillas with various toppings.  I was pleasantly surprised by how many things I could add to my tacos without incurring an upcharge.  The shrimp ceviche had a nice balance of citrus without being overly acidic and the portion of shrimp for the price was great. I was surprised that this isn't one of the protein upcharges for that reason alone.  The ghost pepper steak didn't pack as much heat as I was expecting, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I think my only complaint is that the tortillas themselves weren't served warm.  The only thing I love more than a toasty little tortilla blanket of love for my taco fillings is a good deal, and Condado certainly provided the latter.  For five tacos, an order of guacamole, three margaritas, and three beers, our bill was $45 before tip.    I spotted a few other taco options that piqued my interest, so perhaps I'll use another happy hour special to do some R&D for creating the perfect taco.",

Also a new addition than what I'm used too is the fire shell taco (similar to Taco Bell only like 100x better). The appetizer where you pick three dips was also very good! The corn  salsa and queso was my favorite. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I'm coming back!",

Thankfully, many of the items on the Condado menu are perfect by themselves, but a symphony in your mouth once they all come together. We took our kids (one with a food allergy) and even they had a blast building their own tacos. The online allergen menu was super helpful, so we had very little worry heading here for a lunch. We all shared a queso and chips (but really, the kids ate most of the queso). The chips are fresh and shatter in your mouth, not in the dip. The drink menu was equally delicious and just as extensive as the taco list.   If we're looking at things to be picky about, I'd pick the chorizo. It was just alright, more spice, less grease? Just a bit...meh as a filling. Maybe better as the double deckeresque option.  Anyways, go here...now...so many different ways to customize your tacos, taco bowls, bowls etc.",

You can build your tacos with as few or as many toppings as you with. And they don't charge extra if you go overboard. You can easily fill up on food and a few Margaritas for under twenty bucks!

We ordered some apps - we got the salsa Rojas, the salsa verde, the original queso, the traditional guacamole, and the pineapple salsa. Their chips are to die for! The queso and the guacamole were my favorites!   For my entree, I ordered of the Build Your Own Taco - I ordered the chicken tacos with lettuce, cheddar cheese, bacon, sour cream, and tomatoes. OMG these tacos were incredible!!! Mouth-watering good! I also tried their rice as a side dish. I liked the rice a lot and would get it again.   In conclusion, Condado in Lawrenceville will be the new spot!",

    "text": "Wow, very impressed. I've worked 4-5 blocks from the downtown location for the last 6 months and I don't know why it's taken me this long to come check out Condado Tacos.  We had a large party of 7 show up for dinner on a Thursday evening at their Lawrenceville location, while it was really busy, they had no problem seating us in the back away from the bar and commotion where the longer tables are for large groups. Our waitress was friendly and wonderfully explained the at-first intimidating menu to us - on the \"Make Your Own,\" menu, each column is essentially a taco, and you have a ton of customizability with this - a great way to play with the flavors. They also have a well crafted pre-made taco menu in case you're not feeling all that adventurous, but the tacos on there too are insanely good.   Definitely order the queso, it's seriously some of the best queso and chips I've ever had, especially in Pittsburgh. Blows all the other Mexican-queso-serving restaurants out of the water. The homemade chips and queso also come with a dish of two other salsa - your standard red salsa, and a green salsa. The green salsa was surprisingly impressive, very garlic heavy with just a slight kick - just as good as the queso.   We also ordered a pitcher of house margaritas to split among us, and while it felt a liiiitle light on the tequila, the sourness of the margarita made up for it, seriously a delicious cocktail. I found Condado's to be a tad more sour than other Mexican places, which I loved.   After a bit, our personal crafted tacos arrived. While I don't remember the specifics of each one since there are sooo many options for these, I will say that the pollo, pulled pork, and ghost chili pepper marinated steak were absolutely sublime.  Play around with the CYO menu, it's hard to ruin a taco from here because everything is that good. I can't wait to come back!",

Both had a good amount of spice but let's talk about the real star of the show...the chips! They are crispy and fresh. Sometimes a little on the greasy side but typically and consistently good.  I like to build my own tacos and try new combos all the time. It's easy and fun to try new concoctions every time. Typically I go with one chicken and one ceviche. Then I mix it up with the toppings and salsas.   The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the margaritas seems to be pretty inconsistent. Sometimes they are great and sometimes they are waaaaay too heavy in margarita mix.   All in all though, you've gotta check this place out!",

    "text": "Condado is honestly my favorite place to get tacos, so I of course had to check out the new opening in Lawrenceville! The secret to a good Condado taco is all in the combination:  1. Get the Sweet Lucy tortilla--you get a hard shell and a soft shell so it's the best of both worlds! Also it's vegetarian 2. If you like flavor, get the Thai Chili Tofu, you won't be disappointed! 3. Get all the veggies, cheese, and salsa your foodie heart desires 3. Top off your taco with the Chipotle Honey sauce and your taste buds will be so happy!!   The Lawrenceville Condado location did not disappoint! The food is equally as stimulating as the decor on the walls. My only qualm is the size of the space--it was cramped the entire night and the waiters kept bumping into me as they tried to serve other customers. Also, the music was really loud so it was hard to hear other people at my own table. But the food was spectacular as always, so I will be back!",

I would name my first born condado if they added it as a permanent menu item, I'm not kidding.  I took my boyfriend here and he lives in California, and even HE said it was amazing. We got drinks, the tres amigos, and 3-4 tacos each. Basically had to roll us out of there, but worth it.  The best part is, they keep refilling the chips, no matter how quickly you finish them. And honestly? Couldn't ask for better service.  The vibe and atmosphere is so relaxed, and all of the bartenders are attentive and just want you to have a good time. GET THE PRICKLY PEAR MARG.   Overall, I love this place. Whenever I make plans to go here, I truly can't stop thinking or talking about it until after I've had it and even then, I crave their chips on the reg.",

You put your own taco together with a handy sheet you fill out. Add in all the fixin's between meats, veggies, cheese and so many good sauces. Ugh, the sauces!  I love their brisket, pork and shrimp the most. I always end up making a taco with a variety of different sauces, but I do love the crema the best. They also make a killer gauc, so that's a must! The only miss I can see is the queso. It's a little too runny for my taste, but still flavorful. Which is weird. I'll still eat it, don't get me wrong!   Their margaritas are also fabulous. You know those super sweet syrupy margs? You won't get those here. They're super fresh and satisfying. I've been on a spicy drink kick and recently got the deliciouso, which is cucumber and muddle jalapenos.",

I'm not a big fan of places that will only honor happy hour in the bar area, but I am used to it because of the other location. I put our names on a text list for a table. I was told I would get a confirmation text but never did. When I brought this to their attention, they said it didn't matter but I ultimately never got the text about my table either. When I brought it to their attention they weren't apologetic and I was disappointed that happy hour prices weren't honored.   Other than that - awesome experience! I knew I loved the food and it was consistent here, too. We had an awesome waitress who was very attentive. I love that there's a new option in this neighborhood. Go check it out soon!",

    "text": "I had my first visit here and fell in love! It was actually my first time back to Lawrenceville in years since it really started to develop more (other than to a friend's house). It is really cool to see all the new restaurants and shops. The atmosphere is just so chill and very modernly artistic at Condado. The paintings were just so cute that they just added to the relaxed vibe of the restaurant.  My friend and I came on a Saturday afternoon and were seated right away. The only trouble I had was a little difficulty finding street parking as the lot closeby was rather small and full.   My friend was here before and to downtown location so it was her suggestion and she taught me how to order. There are ordering slips at your table where you choose pretty much everything that comes on your dish from the protein, toppings, type of shell for the taco, sauces, etc - just by checking next to each choice. I attached my selections on the sheet. I got the Juju and sweet lucy style tacos with shrimp and steak. I also had rice and black beans (has extra spices on them and taste different than regular black beans but good!) ordered as sides separately. They were both made pretty similar with hard shell on inside and soft shell on outside. I was skeptical at first but the two textures together were delicious! The tacos are pretty filling - only had two and was stuffed. However we did have chips and guacamole (some of the freshest guac I ever tasted!)   The margaritas are delicious as well - I had a blackberry and a peach one. They are made just right and just two give you a happy buzz. I can't wait to go back! Wonderful food and service with the addition of the pleasant atmosphere! Can't go wrong here.",

    "text": "Of all the reviews I've done up to this point Condado is by far the hardest review I've had to do to date. Everything I formulate in terms of an overall experience is established by service, aesthetics, cleanliness as obviously the food.  But, at Candado I felt like there was something missing in the end. I mean, what does this place not have? As you walk in it's clean--there's street artwork painted throughout the entire establishment leaving you a unique means of entertainment as you sit and eat. Hell, they have a very presentable bar with the proper lighting--and a display of the premium liquors the restaurant serves.  But, as you enter into the downstairs area which is where the bar decided to send us; you couldn't help but feel like you were entering a basement. Art work still canvases the entire area and made it feel less like a basement, but a basement still it felt.   Warmer than the upstairs due to a lack of air flow the entire downstairs was not even considered popular by the waitress who served us. She was very nice and served our every need but there was nobody else down in the basement so she was never really tested in terms of her capabilities in juggling multiple tasks.  I would love to describe the formula which I decided to build my tacos, but it was just all too complicated for somebody who would have never seen a menu of this magnitude before-- witnessing the offspring of Burgatory and Cheesecake Factories love child. The decisions were profound and I didn't want to mess up the taco for the price. Which is exactly what happened-- my bill very quickly rose above $40 after I purchase my food.   All in all, this restaurant is incredibly unique and provides a unique take on the term taco. We got a drink, we got some tacos and we got a bowl that were uniquely qualified to leave you remembering the place.   Feeling like we ate somewhere unique and genuine, I certainly advise going at least once. I believe that's why you go to a place like this-- you go for those unique experiences that don't feel like a chain.   Lastly, based on the fact that it's a humongous portion. I would also suggest that \"To-Go\" isn't really great reheated. Order what you're going to eat, and eat it cold.  The reason why I don't give 5 stars is due to lack of air flow and the complexity of the menu for those who are not regulars at the restaurant. The alcohol was good, but wasn't worth $11 and the prices were a little out of left field for a taco. 7.9/10  Tacos: 8.1/10 Bowl:   7.9/10 Salsa:  8.2/10 Queso: 7.4/10 Drink:   5/10  A/C: Not Really  Pepsi or Coke: Unsure  Ketchup: N/A",

I was excited when they opened up a spot in Lawrenceville - going downtown is always kind of a pain, and Larryville is close enough to my office that I can pop in for lunch tacos.  Quality for this location is equal to downtown - food is always good, service is great, environment is loud and upbeat. The big positive of this location over downtown is that I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table, whereas I've stood waiting for an hour at the downtown location. Worth it, but I'd rather not!  Favorite things to get here - I'm a big BYO kind of person, and I almost always opt for the Thai chili tofu and the roasted portobellos as my protein. I vary with filling but always something crunchy (red cabbage or jicama + cabbage slaw), always cilantro and onions, and the pineapple salsa goes really well with the Thai chili tofu. Guac and chips every time, their guac is really good!   I don't bother with drinks here though - every margarita I've gotten tastes like mostly mixer.",

There are no soft corn tortillas, only flour tortillas and corn hard shells. This would be excusable if the flour tortillas where better than the kind you'd buy at at supermarket, but they aren't.  The tacos are pretty expensive, too. The taco quality did not warrant the $3.50-4 price tag.  On the upside, their margaritas are pretty good.

The walk through Lawrenceville was nice, though, as there are a ton of other businesses nearby and it's a lively area!  The atmosphere is great in Condado, with giant colorful taco-themed murals on the walls. They offer a build-your-own taco menu, along with a few premade order-able options. I built two of my own tacos and had a margarita and spent about $20 - but I got a couple of the pricier options on the taco, like the special shell that is basically a hard shell surrounded by a soft tortilla and cheese.  Their house margarita was served in a mason jar and was a better-than average margarita and cost $7.5. I would definitely recommend coming here during happy hour for 1/2 price margarita and $1 off tacos and eating and drinking to your heart's desire. Next time I'll have to add a special flavor to my margarita - they have 9 different choices! though it adds $1 to your margarita price.   Additionally, our server was nice and knowledgeable about the menu and attentive to our table!  I can't wait to come back and try some different marg flavors!",

This time I also got a plain hard shell taco too, and it was really good.   The customizable menu is a little difficult to grasp at first, but the servers should be able to explain it pretty well. There's so many delicious options you can choose from. I highly recommend topping off your tacos with the sweeter salsas on the menu because they compliment everything really nicely.  The margaritas are always really great. I tried the Kahlo margarita this time, and it was super tasty. They also have several fruity flavor options you can add to certain margs. We also ordered the chips and pineapple salsa, and you really can't go wrong there. The salsa is seriously so good, I wish I could have it every day.

Like we had about 3 servers our whole time there, but no one mentioned if it was like \"hey grab any of us if you need anything\" new people just kept popping up. After we ordered our food someone else came out and asked if we were ready to order lol  The food itself was very good. The first time I ever ate at the one downtown I had tacos and they were cold. This time I had a bowl, and it was hot. It was delicious. They give you a card with check boxes of ingredients, and you can make your own tacos or bowl. I'm so indecisive so it took me a little to decide. But when we ordered we got our food fairly quick as well as our cocktails.  Can wait to go back!",

(Quick Plug if you can help volunteer there for meal prep that would be great). We came for the end of happy hour. As soon as you walk in it is a very vibrant, colorful, and upbeat place. Def has that Lawerenceville vibe to it. I don't remember exactly which tacos i got because i let all my other coworkers pick for me, but this place hands down has the best tacos in Pittsburgh. Their queso is so good that I envisioned myself turn into a butterfly and then fly towards the most beautiful flower and then drank it's divine nectar. Yep that good. Our waiter was great. Wish i could remember his name. Had a real good time their. Personal preference for the margs though is that i wish the jalapeno marg was a bit spicier.",

    "text": "We came on a Wednesday night to check out the spot. It's an interesting vibe with large communal like tables. We were seated downstairs where it was quieter, but had a TV playing Jeopardy....  We ordered drinks, with only one local craft available on draft (two others were out). Our waitress suggested the queso of the month dip, buffalo chicken. We ordered those as we look over the taco options. The waitress recommended 2-3 per person.  So, here's what we ordered and thoughts: El Tradicional - Both hubs and I got this one. It was certainly more authentic than the others and the chorizo was tasty. Downside is that it is messy to eat and the seasoning linger on your hands all night, no matter how much you wash your hands.  Dutch Dragon - Hubs ordered this and it was his favorite. The portobello gave it a heartier taste. I took a bite and thought The Mantis was way better, partly because I don't care for corn salsa (preference thing).   The Mantis - My favorite! I love the heat from the mango habanero sauce, which worked well with the jackfruit. The Lucy shell had a soft spice and crispiness to it. Definitely not authentic, but a good fusion of flavors.  El Santo - Our least favorite. I was intrigued by the Condado Secret Sauce in the description. We didn't taste it. It was such a basic taco, so bland and lack of creativity compared to the others. Pass.  Queso of the month: buffalo chicken: Rich and tasted like buffalo chicken. It's a sizable portion. We probably ate half before the tacos arrived and that was too much. Hubs regretted ordering 3 tacos. I was wise in ordering 2.  It's an okay spot if you're in the area and want to hang out with friends. I can totally get that vibe--grab some drinks, some chips, and maybe a taco or two.",

I love their muddled jalapeno margarita - having sipped some of my pals' flavored margs, I think the jalapeno meshes the best with the tequila without being overly sweet like some of the fruity ones. I haven't had a bad taco here yet, but am still trying to figure out which one reigns ~supreme~. Probably one with their double soft-hard shells.   I like that condado isn't really trying for authentic Mexican, bc lbr that's hard to come by this far east, but just tasty food. Veg friendly too!",

Even when it's busy, the food comes out quickly and the waiters are attentive. It can be a bit tight when it's busy, since they'll seat multiple parties at the same table to avoid a wait, but it isn't really an issue.   Condado's monthly specials are always interesting and include a new drink, guac, queso, and taco. I like the options to either make your own tacos or order some of their suggestions--there's definitely something for every taste! Their tacos are stuffed to the brim, unlike some of the other popular (and more expensive) taco places in Pittsburgh. They have plenty of vegan and vegetarian options, which I appreciate. Their margaritas are also always good, not too sweet but flavorful. The best part of Condado is how affordable everything is! We got 5 tacos total, chips and a huge bowl of guac, and two margaritas for $30. We left feeling happy and a bit too full!",

We stopped in after a tiresome day of bowling at Arsenal to refuel, and were pleasantly surprised by the fun decor and tasty food! Plus, they only had two items with gluten that I need to avoid which is a HUGE plus for me!  We started with their chips and queso before realizing that they had tons of different queso options! Next time we hope to try the broccoli and cheese queso. Then we each ordered two tacos which were out in record time and very filling! We sat at the bar, but the rest of the place is set up with community style tables.   They have a very extensive selection to make your own tacos or you can choose from some of their most popular selections! In my opinion, you can't go wrong, but be sure to check out their taco, queso and marg of the month!",

The blackerry margarita (which is served over ice in a short mason jar) was delicious.  So similar to Burgatory, a handful of \"pre-built\" tacos or build your own.  If you have issues with spicy food, either pre-medicate or skip this restaurant.  My mouth and belly were on fire.   I started with 2 shrimp \"pre-built\" tacos and ventured out to a build your own.  Leave it to the experts, their taco was better than mine.  Ample parking next door in an open lot.  The main floor is LOUD.  The typical Pittsburgh basement is cool and quieter EXCEPT when a PAT bus blocks the basement window and the area darkens quickly.  Give it a try.",

    "text": "On a recent Thursday night, I decided last-minute to check out the new location of the infamous Condado Tacos. I figured I'd save myself a table given the time I was visiting, so I logged onto my Yelp app and checked myself into their line. I got a message that it would be a five to ten minute wait, and there were three parties ahead of me. Cool; no problem here, right?  Well imagine my shock when I arrived and was told Condado Tacos doesn't use Yelp and NoWait to reserve spots. Something about how the business owners activated the service on the Yelp page but the staff don't have access to it. Um...WHAT? No. Unacceptable. There are hundreds of businesses in this city that don't Falsely advertise a line service to their customers. There is no reason for Condado Tacos to do this. If anyone from Condado Tacos management reads this, please either disable NoWait on your page or give your staff the tools they need to utilize it.  Anyway. I ended up sitting at the bar since it was the only place where there was (barely) room for me. Not exactly ideal, given the time of year - but I managed to roll my winter coat up to fit into my lap, as well as safely tuck my computer bag under my feet on the floor.   The bartender, to his credit, was very nice. And I soon had a margarita in hand while waiting on a couple made-to-order custom tacos featuring my shells, proteins, and toppings of choice. Think Burgatory, but with tacos instead of burgers - and I think that's the real appeal of this place. I had noticed Condado Tacos does have a \"standard\" menu as well, but hey, why not take advantage of a custom option when it's available?  While waiting, I was able to look around the restaurant a little. The decor is wild - we're talking bright glowing murals surrounding a bar backlit by appealing and calming blue lights. It's a very cool looking place, I'll give them that. But the music was just too. Dang. Loud! Combined with the chatter of a full restaurant and bar, and I couldn't really hear myself think while I was here.  Anyway, I didn't look around long because the tacos arrived pretty quickly. And they were...OK. Not bad at all, but for all the hype I've heard about Condado Tacos this year, I think I expected more in the seasoning and flavor department. I guess the low prices and ability to order exactly what you want are ultimately what people like here. And the quick service was impressive given how busy the place was.  Still, I'm not sure I'll be back to Condado Tacos. The place is too small and too loud for my liking, and while the custom menu option is cool the tacos didn't \"wow\" me as expected. It's an OK place though, and I could be persuaded to return in the right circumstances.",

We got sat next to a couple who was finishing up and they gave us their remaining gift card which had $15 left on it! (SCORE) anyways, the special for happy hour was 1/2 margaritas and $1 off tocos. Let me say... the margaritas were amazing!! They aren't blended with ice, but rather severed over ice in mason jars (another PLUS) and the selection of choices was amazing! After we placed our drink orders we began building our tocos (their menu is set up like Burgatory) and the options to create your own tocos are endless. The service was fast despite how busy it was, and everything was FRESH! Our waitress was super friendly and very helpful & knowledgeable. After we finished our tocos, we sat and finished our drinks. My best friend lives in North Carolina now & is talking about flying back just for this place & their tocos!",

I usually pick one off of there but even those ones are just okay. I would recommend going during happy hour.",

    "text": "Good place, good food, clean, and mostly consistent hours. Although whiskey and tequila selection is great at the other store, selection and perhaps a fair variety of those here, this location has a small beer tap selection that they don't keep properly stocked, and it's worse for their cans/bottles. Also, no WiFi available for customers, unlike the store down on Liberty downtown used to have (may still have?). The music is mostly solid at this location, and fits the theme/format (downtown location can be tough to visit because one bartender likes to commandeer the playlist to off-theme/format hip-hoppy pop--painful), but some staff will come out blaring portable speaker music players (loud) to drown out the ordinary store music well BEFORE closing time (and the store will feel closed as early as 1:30 a.m., perhaps with most of the lights out--little says \"get the hell out of here\" more than that). I've been to this store a fair number of times, and want to come back, but this last time I was hustled to close out my tab perhaps an hour before I was ready to do so--all for server convenience (I can understand a server wanting to close out, but there has to be a way to credit servers by custody of the table, net of tips and all--not hard to program). Why should a customer be harassed over more than one transaction and have to lose the table service they bargained for? Also, how long must one wait at the front of the house to be seated while the host watches television? This place may be slipping fast.",

Great people who are personable and friendly. The queso appetizers are incredible. A real must-- especially the one with corn. Also this place uses the papers with check marks as well. I haven't told a waiter or waitress what I wanted to eat in days! I did the build your own tacos and I got three which I really recommend. Great food, great atmosphere, great service. The only thing I didn't care for was at first they tried to seat us at a long table between two parties. Wouldn't have had much room so I recommend sitting at the bar. But I'm sure they hear that all the time.",

The place was incredible crowded and we waited about 20 minutes for a table.  We noticed the volume of the music was inordinately loud and we basically had to shout our conversation.  But the food was delicious.  A month or two goes by and my wife and I are looking for a place in the neighborhood for a quick bite on a Tuesday night.  We literally walked in and heard the loud music and immediately walked out and over to another place on Butler.  We're not senior citizens that hate loud music but I don't know if we will be back until this place becomes less like a nightclub and more like a restaurant, especially with so many other options in close proximity.",

Pros: High quality food - I've enjoyed everything I've eaten from Condado. Lots of variety for vegetarians and new seasonal items each month Cheap prices- You can get a full meal for under $10 Great service - Everyone that works there (bartenders, servers, hosts, food runners) has a great attitude and actually seem like they enjoy their job. Everything comes out quick and with a smile Rewards program - 10% cash back deal when you sign up. Great stuff  Cons: Literally nothing.   I feel like this review sounds like I work there or own the place but I really don't. I live off 47th in Lawrenceville and couldn't be happier that the perfect restaurant opened in my neighborhood. I will take all out of town visitors to Condado. Keep up the good work!",

All of the food came out very quick, which I was very impressed with. We loved that they refreshed our chips throughout the night. The reason why I wouldn't rate this a 5 is because you make your own tacos. They do have recommendations for quick tacos, but none of us were interested in many of these tacos. One of the tacos that I made was really good, but the second one was mediocre. I would have liked more guidance in regards to good pairings. Additionally, some of the tacos were very greasy and a mess to eat.   Best drink: blood orange margarita",

Everything all the way down to the tortilla chip is amazing. Also, their dips are phenomenal, too. I highly recommend their guacamole- those pickles onions are everything!- and their chorizo queso.

I asked to make the guacamole spicy and got charged for pickled jalapenos. If I knew there were no fresh jalapenos, I would never eat there in the first place. It's a red flag. In addition there is no instructions on how to order the tacos if you are a first timer. I think that is on the server though. Overall everything was bad and I felt the place was dirty.

    "text": "There is no such thing as too much condado. This is our favorite place for tacos for so many reasons. The food is great and delicious. You can customize to build whatever tacos you want. I am a fan of the Juicy Lucy taco shell with pulled pork and pineapple salsa. And the prices are just right, especially for the portions. These aren't wimpy tacos. They are the real deal! We also love their dirty queso and that they have guacamole specials that add unique mix-ins and toppings that unexpectedly just work so well together.",

    "text": "I've been to both of Condado taco's pittsburgh locations. As an avid fan of ethnic cusine with a special affinity for tacos I really and truly want to like this place. I mean I kind of do in theory, completely customizable tacos, queso dips, guac, and nachos. A cool and inventive menu even offering vegetarian and vegan options, who could beat that?? But everytime I go I am unfortunately underwhelmed, I don't know if I'm always choosing incompatible flavor combinations or if I just really and truly don't like the taste of Condado's food. And after three different tries at two separate locations, I'm leaning toward the latter. Customer service is usually not bad here, but the set up of the restaurant/bars are a little funky in my opinion. All in all not a bad restaurant, but definitely not my favorite place to get a taco.",

    "text": "If I wrote this review based solely on the food, I would give Condado Lawrenceville higher marks. Everything was great! Tasty food, reasonably priced and good service. However, this is just part of the equation in this case. I like a place with ambiance and this place just doesn't have the right vibe - at least for what I'm looking for in a dining experience. They squeezed way too many people into the space. The music they played was unrecognizable. It was too loud and just awful - and I like all kinds of music. And most of all, what they did to the beautiful space that was Tender is just criminal. If none of this matters to you, by all means go here because the food is good. But if you want a more chill place where you can have conversation, this might not be that place.",

I wish it was a little quieter and I don't love sharing my table with strangers. However, sitting in the back room or downstairs is quieter and I do a lot of take out. Friendly servers. Keep it up.",

Finally got waters and ordered. Food was cold and they never came back by. Had to go to the bar to ask for refills on water. We also had drinks, but they never came back by to see if we want another. On top of all that, the place if filthy. There is a layer of grim on the tables and floors. Do not go.",
