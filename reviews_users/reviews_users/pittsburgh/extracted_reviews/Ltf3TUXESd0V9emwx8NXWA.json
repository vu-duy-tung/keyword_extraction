They were the best part of the meal. It took the staff 10 minutes to greet us at our table and deliver the food menu even though it wasn't crowded at the time. I ordered the Caesar wrap and my friend ordered the Camburger. Unfortunately, the waitress brought me out the wrong entree and a side dish that did not order. I ended up returning the side dish and the entire. The kitchen staff proceeded to make me a Caesar wrap like I ordered. In the end, I was still charged accidentally for the side dish that I didn't order but that was corrected on my bill. The restaurant was a bit colder which made it a bit uncomfortable. Also, my friend was not given the correct change for her bill. Overall, the food is fine and the service was below average.",

We went to the one in Southside, but there is a Lawrenceville and Wexford location as well. We ordered the donut holes as an appetizer, and it was only five dollars for probably 15 or 20 donut holes and 3 different sauces to choose from (cinnamon butter, chocolate, and strawberry sauce). I think we paid an extra 50 to try all three. The donut holes were warm and delicious. Then I had the morning cheesesteak made with a wrap instead of on bread. It was delicious, but there were too many fatty, chewy pieces of meat. However, it was still really good. It came with a choice of hash browns, fresh cut fries, or sweet potato tots. I chose sweet potato tots with no regret, but I do wish they were crunchy on the outside. The service was a bit slow even though it wasn't busy, but our waitress was kind.

I thought the sweet potato tots were delicious dipped into the cinnamon sugar icing. We also tried the nachos and fried pickles. Normally, I love every type of fried pickle. This time, I wasn't as impressed- the breading was delicious, but slid right off so I was eating the pickles separate from the breading. The queso sauce on the nachos was DELICIOUS. I could have eaten another serving of the nachos, rather than the pickles. I wish they would have had more vegetarian options and maybe a choice for soup. Aside from these few things, the service was wonderful, vibe was cool, and food was good. This is a great place to stop for a drink or quick lunch- I look forward to returning.",

Restaurants that have very diverse menus often fail becuase it is difficult to produce quality and quantity. Dive certainly bucks this trend. Almost everything on the menu is excellent. The only bad expierience I had was the wings (little soggy), but I am going to give them another chance. Everything else has been consistently great.   The drink selection here is optimal- plenty of draft options, and a large cocktail menu. Something for everyone. The ambiance is nice too- defintley something southside has been lacking.  Last but certainly not least- their happy hour specials are outrageous here. So worth it. Check this place out if you haven't yet, you won't be dissapointed.",

The old coppertops had 2 other patrons in the whole establishment, which the bartender said had now been dive bar for 6 months.. it wasn't hard to see why by the attitude and demeanor of the staff. The male bartender had a great personality and even agreed the other two employees were \"admittedly having rough days\".. the tall blondes awful attitude only paled in comparison to the glasses wearing brunette that flaunted her misery. When you work in the highest concentration of bars per  capita in the entire US, you have to stand out somehow. If it isn't by concept, it better be by service. Unfortunately this will be our last stop in.",

    "text": "This place is great! My boyfriend and I always love to see and try new restaurants as they come in and out of our South Side neighborhood.  It's no secret that restaurants turn over pretty frequently, especially in this mid-section of Carson St.  Dive is in the old Coppertops space but they have completely remodeled with a great new atmosphere.  The service is great and the food is even better.  We've eaten here twice now and have not been disappointed either time.  This last visit I had the Shrimp Po Boy but subbed out the shrimp for crab cakes and made it a wrap instead of sandwich - it was incredible!! They've got something good going here..  I checked out their menu from their other locations online and I cannot WAIT until they begin serving Brunch at this location; the Brunch menu items sound phenomenal!",

I've actually never been to the other locations, but the service, food, and atmosphere of the Southside location are spot on.   My boyfriend lives right around the corner and this has become a go-to spot for us. The drink menu is extensive (really solid list of drafts, bottles, wines, and craft cocktails) and they have a good happy hour as well. The bartenders are always very friendly and every drink I've tried here has been delicious!  I've been in for brunch and dinner and I am honestly shocked at how huge their menu is. There is literally something for everyone. Pages and pages of apps, sandwiches, large plates, wraps, salads, bowls... you name it. Everything that we've tried has ranged to pretty good to excellent - we've never had a bad meal. We've even brought my parents here and my stepdad is quite the picky eater. He loved it!  The atmosphere is really great as well. With the place being fairly new it's never been packed anytime we've gone in. I could see it getting busier as the location becomes more popular! I am really glad that Dive has chosen to open a location in the Southside and will continue to go back.",

    "text": "Giving Dive Bar & Grille (SS Location) 3 stars for now. I will definitely go back and check it out again to update my review.I know this business just recently opened, so I think with some time they will work their way up to a higher review. There was simply nothing that stood out at Dive Bar & Grille.   We went early Saturday evening (around 4-5 PM) for apps & drinks. The atmosphere inside is really nice & clean and it looks like they did a great job at renovating from what was there before (I believe it used to be Coppertops). There is also an upstairs but we sat downstairs by the window. There was only 1 other party eating there and a handful of people sitting at the bar while we were there. It was kind of a weird time, but hopefully they get busier throughout the night!  Chris and I both ordered beers from the draft list. If you like beer, they had a lot of good options! I went with my first Summer Shandy of the year, which you can never go wrong with. Chris explained to the waiter what he was looking to drink and he helped with picking one. Their menu is huge and has something for everyone! We ended up ordering just appetizers and split them between the 2 of us. We got the hummus plate, zucchini fries, and kalua pork sliders. Everything was good but nothing amazing. I look forward to going back and trying one of their entrees, everything sounded good!",

I peaked at the menu on the window and decided to head on in.  I ordered a bloody Mary. It was a homemade mix. It was delicious. A little too peppery for me but overall not bad.  I waa stuck between western burrito (peppers onion eggs hashbrowns) or a breakfast cheese steak (shaved steak onions eggs peppers) i went with burrito and decided on French fries since burrito already has hash browns in it. Sadly I got hash browns instead of fries on the side but o well.  Overall great menu and cool vibe. Sat & Sunday happy hour 9-11. Kitchen open til midnight daily. Kids brunch menu (including deep fried pb&j)",

But I gave it a try none the less.  It is loud! Even though everyone was just sitting at the tables talking to each other the design of the room makes it nearly impossible to hear the waitress. Or the people you came there with. Eventually we got tired of screaming \"sorry I didn't catch that\" and just ate in \"silence\".  I ended up with a burger and it was okay. Nothing special. Felt like I could walk anywhere on Carson and get the same burger for a cheaper price.  The one upside is their happy hour and draft list.",

We split a small plate and a large plate and that was more than enough for us, plus a couple of drinks! Service was great and the atmosphere is nice: not too loud, but still busy enough to not feel dead.   The pretzel sticks are bomb, plus very nicely-priced. I would get these again on my next visit here. We also got the stacked mac and cheese, which comes with buffalo chicken tenders on top. Wasn't a huge fan of the added chicken because it was slightly dry and there were only a few pieces - I would probably get the regular mac and cheese next time I came.   Overall, it's a great place to grab drinks and food on a chill night out! I will definitely come back to try out their brunch menu, as it looked pretty good and decently-priced!",

My letter to Dive Bar and the reason I've never returned to this shit April 7, 2018  Dive Bar & Grille Attn:  Tom (owner) 2132 E Carson St Pittsburgh, PA 15203  Tom:  Enclosed, please find a money order for $50 to pay for food I did not order.  This closes the matter between you and I.  Considering the situation, as a wise business owner, you'd be remiss if you didn't take a moment to think about the experience from your former customer's point of view.  Wouldn't you want to know what caused two customers who have patronized your business multiple times to get up and walk out?  From my perspective, you delivered food we did not order.  We asked if we could have a mix of the varieties of tacos and your server said yes. I confirm we did order one of every variety, but your staff was well aware of what they were doing - taking advantage of customers.  I'm sure they were laughing in the back when they put in the order for 15 tacos.  Your server should have had enough common sense to confirm we wanted 15 tacos when I specifically asked if the tacos could be mixed and matched on a plate and then said we wanted 5 tacos, not plates.  When I approached the server after the ridiculousness was delivered, I got nothing but attitude with the summary message you ordered wrong, so too bad.  Then you sent, what I assume was your bartender (as you implied on our call yesterday), to take a picture of my license plate.  This is another thing you should think about.  What if your employee had been injured?  You showed absolutely no regard for your employee's health and safety by sending him/her out into heavy traffic to sneak behind a running vehicle wearing all black at night.  Furthermore, I'd suggest whomever blindly followed your orders should take some time to reflect upon themselves and determine why they're willing to risk themselves for a $50 tab and an owner who doesn't care about his employees.  Last of all, you blackmailed me with your surveillance video to get what you want, $50.  Well, now you have it and everything else that comes with it.  Had you looked at things from my perspective, you could have worked with me to come to an amenable agreement as I'd requested on the phone; however, you chose to create an enemy.  You make poor business decisions and if you continue to do so, your business will suffer.    Now that I've provided all this useful constructive criticism, you can choose to act on it or not.  Either way, not only have you stolen from me and blackmailed me, I've given you advice that will help your business in the future should you choose to heed it.  You're welcome, B",

The ahi tuna wrap is amazing, one of my favs. I also love the chopped chicken salad, it's my go to. The buffalo egg rolls...I mean how can one not love creamy buffalo chicken fried in a crispy wrap! I've also been for brunch and love the build your own bowls. My boyfriend says their burgers are great. I've had private parties upstairs for work and they always do a fantastic job with the catering. The service is always good too. I've honestly never had a bad experience here.

Servers here were super cool and the beer list was good too with a lot of local brews. I had an order of wings which were tasty, my date had shrimp and grits, and we also split a quesadilla that had pulled pork and Mac and cheese in it. Each of us got a drink and my bill was only 24 bucks. Unheard of. Will be back very soon to try more happy hour items!",

There are a variety of apps on the menu, and they are half priced during their happy hour to compliment a drink of the day and reduced wine / beer prices.  The staff has been very friendly each time I've been there and very knowledgeable about the menu. I'm always happy when I ask about the beer selection and they offer a sample if it's something new - certainly helped me find a good one!  The chicken wings are pently for a full meal for me. I had the regular ones with all different sauces for dipping, because I couldn't choose just one. The spicier the better for me, so I went with the sriracha / spicy / garlic flavored ones. Delish!",

Went in nice place, looked like a good menu, beers were good.  Now the service and food a totally different story!  Meals came out before the silverware and napkins...even after asking at least 3 times. Wasn't busy so shouldn't have been any confusion. Couldn't get a water if you were on fire, asked twice and had to go to bar since server forgot. Asked for sliders extra well done - came out as a chopped up patty (not sliders) medium well. Didn't eat them..server never asked if things were ok. Kept disappearing to who knows where.  French fries were decent, wings seemed ok (friends got them). But had to ask for sauce 2-3 times.   Missing the mark here on service mostly. Food not worth the lack in service.",

It was $11.50 for 10 wings, which is decent, and I read the happy hour price is even better. There wasn't that much sauce, and the wings weren't well-coated. It felt like the wings were placed in the box, sauce dumped on top, and the delivery guy was in charge of getting the sauce distributed during delivery. The fries were mainly just a bunch of edge slivers containing skin. The slaw was pretty heavy, and almost a little too greasy for my taste. However, the cabbage/carrots were fresh.   I saw a trend with in-restaurant meal reviews being yummier, so this place is probably not the best for delivery. I'd definitely give this place a try in-person next time during a happy hour.",

Our 4th food stop found us at Dive shortly after church today.  Thankfully the menu seemed to offer something for everyone.  My youngest had the crab/ eggs Benedict, our oldest got the Salmon BLT wrap and my wife and I shared the Pittsburgh Cheese steak (Pittsburgh beer cheese sauce).  Absolutely perfect bar food.  After 3 days of world cuisine we were all ready to go our own way.  Each dish was perfectly portioned and had just enough of a twist to make it unique to the Dive experience.  The atmosphere was perfectly laid back (matching the vibe of the closed street for families biking/ walking dogs/ and an outdoor spin class) and staff seemed to be having fun.  Based on the menu and comfortable atmosphere this was no Dive bar although I'm pretty sure I could have gotten a PBR if I hadn't been tempted by the Nitro option on tap.   Dive is a Pittsburgh must for anyone looking for a tasty food variety and a great beer and liquor selection.",

I ordered the Hangover which was Prosciutto, bacon, provolone, lettuce, tomato, pesto aioli and a fried egg on top.  It came out on toasted, thin cut bread and looked delicious.  It was a tad hard to eat as the bread didn't hold up well once the sandwich was fully assembled but the taste was delicious.  The home made potato chips were a perfect side.    My cousin ordered the Alabama Slammer burger which had a brown sugar glaze, bacon, cheddar, provolone topped with onion straws.  He ordered the fries and a side of slaw.  Judging from the fact that he didn't say a single word till that burger was fully engulfed in his digestive cavity, I would say he loved it.    This is my 5th or 6th visit to this location and everything we have ever ordered has been delicious.  Skip the busy section of Carson St and find this gem for Happy Hour- the specials are awesome!",

We split three apps (all of which are half price). We had the southern comfort (quesadilla with pulled pork and mac and cheese), spinach dip and panko shrimp. Very random selections but all of which were solid.   My friend opted for a beer and I went for a scotch cocktail (just one of those days). They were both $2 off.   The waitress was very on top of everything, even with it being pretty busy since the Steelers were playing.   This place is a great call for HH, but not sure I can speak to any other time of the day.",

Dive Bar's happy hour is M-F 5-7 and S-S 9-11 and consists of 1/2 off apps and great cocktail/beer/wine specials!  In addition to the happy hour specials Dive Bar has weekly specials too, we happened to be there on 1/2 price sandwich night!  I swear between the apps and the sandwiches we could pick from almost the entire menu at 1/2 off!  We ended up choosing fried pickles, loaded croquettes, quesadilla, and the turkey Cobb sandwich with sweet potato tots.  Everything was sooo yummy! I have to say the sweet potato tots were addicting and served with a cinnamon butter that I couldn't get enough of!  I can't wait to go back and try some more happy hour apps!",

My friend and I were looking to get an appetizer and settled on the Pittsburgh Nachos. This plate was their house chips piled high with beer cheese, bacon and other fabulous nacho toppings! It did not disappoint. For my meal, I had the Luau Chicken wrap! It was chicken and bacon, topped with pineapple salsa, red bell pepper, spring mix, onion and bbq sauce. It was both salty and sweet! My other friends got variations of the buffalo chicken sandwich. One friend asked for it to be in a wrap and the other asked for it to be between to pieces sourdough bread and pressed like a panini. The waitress was extremely accommodating and got my friends exactly what they want! I will definitely be back to try other dishes off their menu!",

I got the dirty martinis which were $2 off and they were so delightfully dirty and delicious. They came with bleu cheese stuffed olives.  We split some apps since all of the Small Bites section was half off. Everything came out fairly quickly considering it was happy hour and getting busy.  The Southern Comfort quesadilla was so good! It was filled with smoked Gouda, house mac n cheese and pulled pork. The fried crimini mushrooms came out in a giant basket filled to the brim. They were lightly coated in flour and fried. The side of horseradish sauce for dipping was key. The fried pickles were giant pickle spears again lightly floured and fried and paired with their homemade ranch.  Can't wait to go back and try some more of the amazing sounding food!",
