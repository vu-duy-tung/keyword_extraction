Upon arrival, the bar was pretty much empty around 5:30.  Business picked up as we got closer the 8 PM scheduled Penguin game (hockey).  The bartender can make a mean vodka and soda.  I had a turkey melt that was out of this world.  a definite neighborhood bar, the interior is updated (trendy garage door that I assume opens in the warm months).  I was told there is outdoor seating as well.  A good time had by all, I recommend this place for great beer selections and quality bar food.  Cheers!",

The fish sandwich is a huge piece of Icelandic cod which could not be better prepared.  The awesome sweet potato fries come with an even better brown sugar butter dip to complement the fries. The smokehouse barbecue chicken sandwich was also fantastic.    Selection of beers is also good and reasonably priced with most beers at around $4. They have east end beers on draft and some nice ciders on draft and bottled including Mackenzie's black cheery cider. I. Short, there is nothing that is short of great in this wonderful neighborhood pub. Will definitely be back.",

Even Burgatory charges less than that.   They have a great beer selection, but it's pretty pricey.

First the positive: I liked that it wasn't super crowded, but we weren't the only ones there. There was some picnic table outside seating which was nice. The menu had quite a bit of options to choose from. I ordered the whiskey rebellion burger. I had ordered it medium, but it came out medium well. I think my burger was missing a topping or maybe it was on there and I just had no idea. Regardless, the sauce was really good and wasn't so overwhelming that it made the burger messy or hard to eat. The fries were amazing! I also had a gristhouse draft which was delicious.   For the less than positive: we had decent attention at first from our server, but once we got our food, we didn't see anyone come out for the rest of our experience. We had to go in to ask if we could get our checks, and after 15 minutes or so of waiting, we went in where we all waited another 5-10 minutes or so to get our checks settled. I will say that our server was also the only one servicing the bar, so I'm not sure if it had to do with staffing for a Monday night or if they are normally staffed that way. So considering it was a one person show for inside and outside, I can understand why it took so long.   Overall: we definitely plan on going back. I can't wait to try something else on the menu because everything sounded good!",

Most reviewers here have touted the burgers, but I also highly recommend the chicken Caesar salad. That was yummy, without being overly salty.  Of special note was our server Sam, who was bright, attentive, and all kinds of pleasant. She instantly made us feel at home in the pub, and was extremely helpful in suggesting what to pick from the menu. I hope she's there for a while -- she definitely added to the warm atmosphere.  Speaking of which, there was a definite feeling that BULLDOG PUB is very much a place of neighborhood congregation. The other patrons during our visit there were obviously all locals and/or regulars. There was a nice easygoing vibe that was contagious.  If I lived in Morningside, I would definitely go here more often. (I live in Lawrenceville, and the place that most reminds me of BULLDOG PUB is HAMBONE'S, which is bigger and can accommodate performances.) As it is, I'll still make an effort to get out here whenever possible.  Now, let's see that great logo of theirs displayed a little bit more prominently and we'll have ourselves a complete winner! ;)",

    "text": "How did we not know about this place??  Food was totally awesome, our server was great, and it has a cool vibe.  We visited on a Thursday night around 9pm and it was busy but we managed to score a table with a waitress!  Great Lakes bottles were on special for $3.50 (awesome!) and the food prices are comparable to other bars we frequent.   We loved the atmosphere. It felt like there was a higher education level in the room... all from a visual assessment, but there was an academic feel for some reason. That said, the pretentious level was low. We actually had a discussion about how it felt like being in Shadyside, if Shadyside was cool. It was a mix of young and old, locals and the more hip crowd juxtaposed against photos and neighborhood memorabilia on the walls.   There is a great list of micros - both on tap and bottled. They also have all the usual domestics. For a bar of its size, the wine list is extensive and with much better selections than the usual Yellow Tail choices at other bars.   We ordered medium wings as an app, and I would have preferred they be a little spicier - the sauce was more like a garlic butter than a medium. We ate them and weren't disappointed! Our dinners consisted of a burger/fries and chicken sandwich/fries, which were all great.  My burger was ordered medium and came cooked MEDIUM. YEAH! I also had it topped with pepper jack, lettuce, tomato, and roasted red peppers, which were all fabulous. The chicken was topped with bacon, BBQ sauce, and a something else I forget, but it was gone before I looked across the table more than twice, and received a double thumbs up. Fries are fresh cut and were a little on the greasy side, but still really good.  We reside just over Stanton in the 10th ward of Lawrenceville and will be back to eat our way though the menu!",

I hate how expensive craft beer is sometimes and the Bulldogs owner understands-they're at least 1-2$ less a pint than anywhere else. The wings are the juiciest in the city and are smothered in a collection of homemade sauces. I love watching games here and enjoying the relaxed atmosphere and the great patio. If you're in the east end or surrounding areas don't forget about the Bulldog in Morningside.",

All the food I have tried there has been really delicious, especially the wings! Prices are pretty typical for any restaurant/bar.  The only complaint I would have is the service, although super friends, was sometimes a little slow, but I totally understand that since it's an up-and-coming place.

The pizza is really good: the sauce is the highlight for me. If I had to criticize,  I'd say the cheese to crust ratio isn't quite it for me (very thin crust, pile on A LOT of cheese and a topping or too and it can get messy). The wings are good. 4/5 stars? We got the spiciest they had an imo not very spicy at all. But for me, crispiness and quality meat is much more important,  and they nailed it in that dept. Needed more sauce. But to top it all off, we got these and ERMERGEHD. I think this is one of those menu items that I now can't NOT order. They also have great affordable drinks: nothing fancy, but it's a nice neighborhood spot for good drinks, way better than average \"bar food,\" and friendly service.",

    "text": "My husband and I were hungry following a day-trip to the Pittsburgh Zoo and wanted to find a restaurant close by. A quick google search brought up the Bulldog Pub with great reviews. A short 0.3 mile drive from the zoo and we found ourselves at the doorstep to a hidden pub in a quiet neighborhood.   The Bulldog Pub is a hidden gem! There's an outdoor space that's fenced in with soft lighting. The restaurant was catering a graduation party outside at the time we visited. They have a large variety of craft beer and wine to choose from. When we arrived there was a mixture of clientele. A family of 3 including a toddler was sitting in the booth behind us, four millennials were at the bar, a group of senior citizens walked in, and my husband and I occupied another booth. The inside of the Pub is a tight space, so I wouldn't recommend visiting with a large group unless you were seated outside. The overall ambiance of the place is truly a Pub atmosphere with TVs playing sports and a large bar.  The food was delicious! We ordered wings and a pizza to share. They had an average list of wing sauces to choose from. Everything arrived at our table piping hot and fresh. They offer unique appetizers that you wouldn't find in most chain restaurants, and you can tell that they put some thought and creativity into their menu.   The waitress was very attentive and hard working. She earned every cent of her generous tip! I highly recommend the Bulldog Pub if you're visiting the zoo or in the area.",

This could be a good or bad thing depending on your preference, but it tasted fantastic. The price was respectable and I came out satisfied.

There was nobody here when we arrived which was on a Friday around 3pm.  The bartender was thrilled to have us because we took up the bar.  He gave us some specials and we had a good time.  We ordered appetizers like wings, hummus, and sweet bread that hit the spot after a hot day at the zoo.  They had a nice outside area that you could hang out which gave it a good neighborly feel in Morningside.  Definitely would recommend this and the next time we volunteer at the zoo I'm sure we will be back.  Also free street parking right in front was nice and convenient.",

They were some of the best I've had.  I don't want to do a whole dissertation on the history of the fried pickle, but I will acknowledge that some chips are too skinny and some spears are too much pickle.  Bulldog has found the balance.  Ok so I guess there was more to the the visit.  The bar isn't particularly close to anything else, but parking was relatively easy to come by.  Bar seating was equally ample.  Wing night starts at 8pm and ends at 10pm on Mondays.  The wings were fine and the side of \"fries\" were overabundant.  The beer was cold.  They did have a NEIPA on tap, but for the big ole price of $7 a pint.  Really an all around good bar and worthy of its rating.",

When the weather cooperates, the patio is a great place to sit and relax. It is fenced in so you can bring your kids and actually enjoy your food and drink while they run around. Taking off a star because the temperature inside can be a problem - uncomfortably hot in the summertime and freezing in the winter. In spite of the temperature issues, this place is definitely an asset for the Morningside neighborhood and one we will continue to visit.",

    "text": "I haven't explored this side of town much but was in the area for an event with a friend and we were looking for a place to stop for a quick beer and meal without going crazy. Checking some other Yelp reviews, this looked like a winner. A good combination of quick bar food yet not dive food.  Could not have been more spot on!  Street parking was readily available on a Friday at 6p and they had some outdoor seating with a large rolling door to let the fresh air into the bar itself. The atmosphere was very laid back and seemed like a lot of regulars from the neighborhood. Everyone was very friendly and sitting at the bar we were approached right away. They have a rotating draft list of local beers along with your usual suspects.  Great offerings from Grist House, East End and Eleventh Hour were available on our visit. The menu is something you can tell there was thought put into.  Like I previously mentioned, it's bar food but not dive food. We tried French Toast Sticks with a Maple Bourbon dipping sauce that was just incredible!  My buddy did a build your own pizza that I tried a slice of and I must say, it was quite delicious.  So you can use their custom sheets to build your own pizzas and sandwich's. A nice touch for a place like this! I had the Bullpen which was fried bologna, roasted red peppers, fried egg, provolone, garlic aioli on Texas toast.  Don't ask questions, just order it!  Freaking amazing!  Toss in their homemade fries and this is a winner!  Not to mention when I ordered I asked for a side of the Hot Garlic Parmesan for the fries and when they came out there was no side...or so I thought.  When I inquired the waitress said, \"Oh hon, the chef tossed your fries in the sauce to coat them all. I hope that's okay.\"  Of! Course! It! Is!  Wow was that a great improvised move on their part. I'm going to have to ask for that more often.  Add in that prices were extremely reasonable (I think my meal was $9.00) and you have got a nice hidden gem here.  The only drawback I had at all was that we both went in with the intent to get the meatball sandwich everyone talks about. When we tried the waitress asked the chef who happened to be out by the bar if the had meatballs ready and he said he hadn't gotten around to it and just continued his conversation with one of the patrons. She apologized but apparently there was not going to be any meatballs to be had on that evening. Strange but I guess it gave us an opportunity to try something else and come back for the meatballs.  That aside, I really dug this place and think you all will too!",

A sweet furry face was looking out...the door opened and we were welcomed warmly by Gemma, a friendly pup. Also, some folks who insisted we sit and have a beer as we planned. The staff was busy cleaning and rearranging, but made sure we felt welcome and got us a beer anyway.    We didn't have time to eat, but the food looked and smelled terrific. Bar food with a unique twist here and there. As we were leaving we checked out the cozy fenced in outdoor area. Can't WAIT to come back!",

    "text": "The type of joint that every neighborhood needs. Warm service, great food (with hearty portions), and a broad selection of beers (from the basic Narragansett-type options, to local IPAs, to dark European ales). The best spot in the East End to watch a game, catch up with friends, or bring some kids in for an early dinner. Plus, you don't have to worry that your money is going to some large chain, or marketing firm, or whatever -- Bulldog is locally-owned and employed. I'm a big fan!",

No frills, nothing fancy, but it's a real Pittsburgh gem. Great place to have a beer and watch the game or just to sit on the patio and enjoy a burger.  Morningside is lucky to have Bulldog Pub on its roster!",

Wednesday's (I think) are half off pizza days and there's trivia every Tuesday. Servers are always pleasant and it's a great place to be a regular :)",

I do my best to get my \"cool friends\" out of Lawrenceville and into a neighborhood bar with awesome specials, a friendly staff, and an updated jukebox (which is apparently very difficult to remove from the wall - sorry again about that, guys).  The BDP doesn't hate kids or dogs, either - so bonus points.  I can't wait for 3rd winter to be over so I can eat wings on their killer patio.",

The beer selection is impressive.  You can't go wrong with the Hummus Platter.  I ordered the Grilled Steak Salad, a huge portion size for only $10.  Pair that with East End Big Hop on tap, life is good!",
