It's doing quite good compared with other Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. The biggest problem is that there were really few waiters. Perhaps we didn't arrive at the right time, about 2pm... Perhaps we should say we were lucky it was still open.",

I usually end up getting the General Tso's Chicken possibly because I'm white, but also possibly because it is just that good. I'm starting to think there is something in the sauce!  I've eaten a few other things that have all been good, and the lunch menu is pretty extensive, and inexpensive.  They keep the free tea coming, and the service has always been good.  The only thing that turns me off a little to this place is the atmosphere, it is a little bit run down in the entry way and the dining area.  I'll definitely be going back again, maybe for some more General Tsos, or maybe after reading these reviews for the salt and pepper squid.",

Our regular dishes included fresh vegetables (do miao, bakchoy, bai chai), salty pork chops, salty squid, general tso's chicken, mapo tofu, and other dishes we would miss from back home. Also try the California Roll - it's not typical and has a bit of a Cantonese twist to it. Maybe it's the rice, but I think it's yummy. This place reminds me of a restaurant you can find in Chinatown or Flushing, NY. The food is pretty good, and if you're craving Chinese food (not the take out kind) OK can hit the spot.",

I've also heard the most horror stories in terms of service out of places that I know of. The owner isn't nice, but fortunately, you rarely see him. The lady (the wife?) is a little temperamental but reasonably friendly.  The nicer guy (the brother-in-law?) moved to Orient express when they started that branch.   Just a historical sidenote, OK used to be in the uber ghetto spot in Oakland that Korea Garden now occupies.",

    "text": "I'm Asian and I've been here probably atleast twice a month. The food here is authentic Chinese food. So some people might not be able to eat some of the food on the menu. I ate at probably every Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh besides takeout/delivery. When I eat here, I usually have a party of atleast 6 people. In my opinion the food is very good. The waitress is also the owner. She's a nice person but she has an attitude. So if your looking for good service I think your gonna be disappointed, but if your looking for authentic(real) Chinese food. I would recommend coming here. Even for American Chinese food it has the orient taste to it. They really have lack of service if you ask many times separatly. But are you there for food? Or for service? This is the most popular Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh amongst Asian people. What I recommend as an entree is the steamed oysters, fried calamari, fried or steamed seabass, their fried vegetable(Asian greens), short ribs, any style crabs, seafood soup, general tso chicken(real Chinese style), ginger and scallion lobsters and black beans clams. There's many more but it's for you to decide. Like I mention if your looking for good authentic Chinese food then come here. I wouldnt recommend coming here if your trying to have a romantic dinner.  Hope this post helps you.",

    "text": "A good place to go to for more authentic Chinese (Cantonese) food.  All of the staff are Cantonese, I believe.  This place is decently sized, and it has a drink menu and a sushi menu.  And thank goodness, there is a small parking lot, because we all know that parking is very, very sacred in the area around CMU/Pitt.   My favorite dish: Their Bok Choy (or bai cai) is amazing.  Seasoned just the right amount, neither too salty or too bland!  It's oily but not dripping with oil.  I love it, I could eat a whole plate of this.  The duck is pretty decent too, although it's a bit high on price - about $17 for half a duck, $22 for a whole duck!  But the taste may be well worth it because I haven't really gotten this style of duck anywhere else in Pittsburgh.  Some of the dishes are questionable - they look more like American Chinese style, dripping with strange orange/red/brown sauce but there aren't too many of these.  Recommended for people craving more authentic Chinese food in Pittsburgh, and we all know how hard that can be to find.",

    "text": "First I do not normally review but today was just the last straw for years of bad service overlooked due to decent food. My family and I have been going to Orient Kitchen since the early 90's back when they were located on Semple st. Next to Larry and Carols. All the other reviews about the nasty lady with the bad attitude is the owner Amei. Back during my college days at Pitt. I practically lived at this place. While I am no longer that close our family do still make the trip to celebrate holidays and birthdays. Today we ordered our usual dishes. The salt and pepper squid being our favorite we always order 2 plates for our large group. The squid was not edible. It was small squid pecies almost as if the scraps of what was left over in a regular order. Then it was deep fried much too long. The texture was hard to chew much less enjoy. When it came time for a meal check i mentioned this to our server. The young lady agreed that it looked overcooked. She took it back to the kitchen only for the owner Amei to come out and refuse any type of compromise. She told us that this was a subpar ingredient order from the supplier and that there was nothing she could do to improve the quality. Then she said she still manage to sell over 200lbs of the salt and pepper squid this week, Her regular customers all complained about the quality. To which I politely asked if this was a known issue why didn't she mention this when the order was placed? I also mentioned as a long time customer you could have said the quality may be off why not order just one plate first and see. At this point she went into her usual rant, said what can she do if she takes the dish back she will take a loss and have to toss it in the trash. It sad that all she cared about is her bottom line. The insult that bothers me is I never mentioned or hinted at a refund. I was mearly curious why today's order was the way it was.As a business owner you try to please your customers. Not here. Not with her. It does not matter if your new to the place or a long time regular like me. Why spend your money at a place that treats you with bad service along with a helping of back talk. Take a long hard look at all the other negative reviews. What's the common theme??? All bad service from the same person. FYI she tries to play off her sarcastic attitude as just her personality. Don't buy into the BS.",

We decided to go here because I hit the limit of wondering what the food tastes like at this restaurant after passing by this place for an year and in fact, I live 3 min away from here by walk. The reason I avoided this restaurant is all I heard about this place is that their food sucks. I love the food here and so do my friends. I guess everyone has different taste or ppl just chose the wrong menu.   We ordered General Tso's chicken, Twin flavored fried rice, and Half fried chicken in garlic sauce.   General Tso's chicken- this menu tastes slightly different in every Chinese restaurant. At Oriental kitchen, it tasted a little different but very delicious.   Twin flavored fried rice [half chicken & half shrimp]- I do not recall the exact name of the menu but it was sth like that... anyways... whatever it is called IT IS DELICIOUS! OH MY! It was just... it wasn't fried rice. It was more of sauce on the rice bed. It was moist and never-seen-before fried rice.   Chicken in garlic sauce- I don't recall the name of the dish exactly but this on was fabulous! The skin was slightly crisp and inside was tender with perfect sauce.   Overall, I had a whole new experience of Chinese food at this place. When I think of Chinese food, it's greasy, so I get sick of eating it a little after I start eating it and regret eating it after wards. However, that was not the case this time. It was so good couldn't stop eating and eventually finished all! yay!   The only downside was they close at 10pm or so and we went there for dinner and they wanted us to leave at like 9:45 but oh, well!",

    "text": "This place has been a staple in my life ever since I moved to the city. To the untrained eye, the menu looks fairly simple - standard chinese favorites, a basic sushi menu - no big deal, right?   Wrong. This is as close as you're going to get to authentic Chinese in the city. Fresh seafood (a rarity for Pburgh), traditional dishes on a rotating specials menu and amazing hot pots are what you can expect to find.   I recently tried the basil chicken with crispy milk, and I'm addicted. Sweet, slightly crunchy milk balls paired with a flavorful brown sauce and crunchy sauteed basil are an unexpected match made in heaven. It's not on their everyday menu, but it's always worth asking if they're able to make it. (this place is great for off the menu offerings if you know what you're asking for)  If you're a veggie lover (or even on the fence), the buddah wrapped vegetables are a must. An assortment of crunchy Chinese veggies are baked in tofu skin and doused with a rich dark sauce - its unlike anything I've had before. So good! And I kind of hate meatless dishes.   The hot pots are are always a sure bet. The pork, fish, and tofu with veggies may sound like a mismatched assortment of whatever, but they work their magic. Oh yes, they work their magic. It's my favorite, but that being said, you can't go wrong with any of their hot pot offerings. Shit is dope.  I could go on and on about all the amazing things Orient Kitchen has to offer, but they're open till 11 most nights, so you're better off figuring it out for yourself.",

I ordered the sweet and sour chicken under the impression that we would eat food family style.  There was a Lazy Susan at our table for sharing too.  However, food on the lunch menu comes with rice on the place, and it is not very easy to share with.  The lunch items are $6.50 and come with salad.  My egg drop soup was very good, though the sweet and sour chicken is probably what you would expect of fried food.    When we came in, the waitress complained about how we had reserved a table for 12:30 PM, but showed up at 1:30 PM.  Our administrator said that she had reserved it for 1:30 PM.  \"It's never crowded here.  Only on the holidays.  Next time, don't call me.\"  As we ordered food, a few people needed some extra time and she rolled her eyes.  I thought she had to be the owner to have that kind of attitude, so I asked her if she was.  \"Do you have a problem.  I'm just a worker here.  I'm not the boss.\"  Wow.  I think her attitude got a little better after that, but still...  One of my colleagues said that his wife and he come here a lot, and that waitress always has an attitude.",

I'm used to the way it's prepared in NY/NJ restaurants -- with almost twice as many jumbo shrimp, rather than with slightly smaller-than-jumbo shrimp.  Had 4 entrees and the crispy milk dessert between 4 people.  The flavors were all there, even in the tofu dish that's called Buddha's Delight or something or other.  The price worked out to exactly $15 per person, including tip and tax, which is OK but I think $12-13 would've been more appropriate.    I like coming here with Asian people so I can get tofu dishes without being met by uneasy faces.  It definitely made for a good dining experience and I'm willing to overlook the pricing since I get homesick for the traditional Chinese family-style dining experience with real Asian food and Orient Kitchen does a pretty damn good job of hitting the spot.  It probably won't be competitive if it was located in NY or NJ where the restaurants are more authentic Cantonese and have a larger menu, but it would put up a very good fight.  It suffices in Pittsburgh, though.",

The major issue I had was that my friend clearly and concisely stated that she was allergic to fish and had a seafood allergy. She ordered a benot box and was subsequently served crab and shrimp tempura. She told the waitress she would become ill, and the waitress started mumbling/complaining and just walked away. She came back a few minutes and asked how was everything, and my friend explained her allergy, the waitress started arguing saying she knows the menu and fish is not seafood. We were polite throughout and i just asked for the menu so my friend could order something else. Then she said i will change to vegetarian.   Entertaining but strange. Not to mention, prior to the strange fish incident, the waitress raised her voice and scolded a two year old for using chopsticks as drum sticks... At the time there weren't other patrons in the room... The noise was only mildly annoying and she only made the noise for about 20 seconds, I was re-directing when the waitress pretty much yelled at my child. That being said, unlike many moms, I sincerely encourage other adults to reprimand my child, so the reprimand would have been welcome, had it been either polite or professional. The booster seats hadn't been cleaned from prior use.   This was the first time in my life that I considered not tipping, but we decided to tip regardless of the obnoxious attitude. I really loved the Chinese broccoli at this place but I won't return after this embarrassing service. Also the food was brought back on the same plate, if my friend had a more serious allergy, the contamination could have made her sick. Luckily her throat doesn't close up, it just gets itchy when she has seafood.  The waitress kept calling us lady in a most obnoxious tone, it was a strange lunch. She was so unbelievably rude, it was entertaining. She was quite nice to the business men who came in when we were about to leave. I am not sure what her issue was, but I won't be back to find out!",

Sometimes I've ordered their Peking Duck, but its nothing spectacular, China Palace serves up better Peking Duck.  Also their Twice Cooked Pork is also lackluster.  OC has a decent liquor selection, and their drinks are relatively cheap at under 5 dollars each.  Prices for dishes are typically in the lower to mid teens; a typical check tends to run around 20ish for those with larger appetites, drinks not included.  OC is pretty good Canto food by Pittsburgh standards, but for people who are use to better options for Cantonese style Chinese food found in more Asian-populated cities, the food may leave more to be desired.",

    "text": "This place is probably one of the more authentic tasting Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Don't order your typical american-chinese dishes like General Tso or that sweet and sour bs. That is not real chinese food. Get the salted-squid, and stir-fried chinese brocilli, the razor clams, the seafood soup, etc. I basically ask for whatever popular dishes the chinese customers eat. Closest thing to china-town food in Pittsburgh.  The places isn't the nicest place though. But then again, most places that are fancy, do not have authentic chinese food. lol",

    "text": "I admit that its nickname (\"OK\") made me smirk. Whoever christened it hit the nail right on the head.  This restaurant is above threshold, but only just.  Its menu is classic Cantonese. The food is, on the whole, competently prepared. It's a good compromise between American-Chinese takeout and some more authentic flavors (e.g., a fish steamed in its entirety, head and all).    The quality/quantity to price ratio is not super. For example, the \"fried duck with taro stuff\" [sic] came with more taro \"stuff\" than duck. The pieces are served atop a big mound of shredded cabbage to make the plate seem more plentiful than it actually was.  The taste is good, but I'm not sure if it's $15 good. The fried tofu and scallop balls had more tofu than scallops, and the scallops were not of the best quality.  The whole fish, though I like it, is too expensive for what it is ($24 for flounder; $30 for sea bass).   The service is prompt and, in its own way, friendly. There is no ambiance to speak of, though that's not what people come here for. I have some reservations about the cleanliness of the kitchen (it has the look of LA restaurants that get B or C on their hygiene grade cards[*]), but I'm not so worried as to not eat here.  Summary: Comparing \"OK\" with other nearby Chinese restaurants, I think I prefer Rose Tea and Ka Mei a smidgen more.

We often went there for the amazing lunch specials, back then for literally $3.00 or $3.50  you could get an awesome nice sized aluminum container filled with steamed rice, your lunch choice and covered with a plastic lid to keep it piping hot. And a can of pop for $0.50. My favorite selection was chicken with baby bok choy in a clear garlic sauce or shrimp with egg (the egg was broken over top the rice and shrimp and was cooked by the heat!); mmm such happy memories.",

For every little thing we asked her, she started scolding us in Mandarin.  I came here once with a large group and my friend and I were ordering for everyone. We were just discussing possible dishes to get and she wrote down everything we said even though we haven't actually ordered it. We didn't realize this until the food was brought out. We didn't want to argue with her so ended up paying for everything.  We also thought we ordered too much and just wanted to ask if we could take a dish off the order. She started yelling at us when we were only asking if it was possible. Extremely bad attitude and very obnoxious.  The food here is also not that great. A lot of the dishes we ordered was pretty flavorless. And I'm talking about their \"authentic\" dishes, not their Americanized ones. Their salt and pepper squid was good, though it's hard to mess that up. Can definitely get better authentic Chinese food elsewhere.  They also cater for large parties in their upstairs dining area. Do not do this. They overcharge for parties by serving subpar food and charge a certain price per person.",

In my experience, I have found the lady in charge to be somewhat bipolar. It definitely helps if you can speak Cantonese yourself and hold a conversation with her. A couple times I communicated exclusively in Cantonese and she was quite happy to help us and recommend orders. Another time, I was talking with a friend in Mandarin and switched to Canto when ordering, though she kept replying coldly in Mandarin and didn't really pay much attention to us during our meal. Maybe she was just having a bad day.  Service aside, their food is quite good. It is somewhat pricey, but this is True of their authentic Chinese counterparts as well (think Rose Tea, Sichuan Gourmet, and Hunan Bar). You'll want to try some dishes not found in these other places; their Specials menu is a good place to start. We once had a pork ribs with purple leaves (sorry for the poor translation), and the pork was delicious, all cooked up to the right point before getting burnt. Other nice dishes include various Chinese vegetables such as pea shoots or Chinese spinach, and barbecued meats such as roast duck or the roast pork pot.",

No acknowledgement of received request.  No response to \"thank you\" when she brought it.  When it came time to pay, my friend and I battled for the bill with credit cards, for all of 30 seconds.  The lady loudly sighed as she went to process the payment.    With basic courtesies like this on display, I'm amazed Orient Kitchen remains in business.  Their lunch special is reasonably priced at $6.50, but I'll gladly vote with my wallet and go elsewhere to eat.  I'd rather support a place that wants its customers to return, or at least pretends it does.  If you're thinking of going to Orient Kitchen, I suggest walking a few steps more.  Chipotle is right next door, their food is just as good, same price, and their counter servers are way friendlier (at least the 2 times I've been there).",

I went in with allergies/a cold after 3pm. yesterday evening, hoping to get a soup to comfort me.  She tossed the menus on the table remarking that she was doing me a favor by placing the lunch menu on the table, even when lunch was technically over. She went away and chatted in Chinese with the nearby table.   She came back to my table and I wasn't ready.  It took her 10 minutes to return.  She turned up her nose at me, and began chatting (loudly) with the sushi chef.  My body language showed I was ready, but she came over when she was good and ready.  I said that I wanted soup, and asked her for her recommendation, since I was feeling under the weather.  I guess she was disappointed in my order.  She refused to apply herself to the question, giving short, sharp answers, avoiding eye contact, and then stating, \"Everyone is different,\" so a recommendation was not possible.  She left again for an extended period of time.  I had time to look around at the dirty carpet.  She brought no tea or water.  I asked about the spring rolls; were they fried?  She tried to educate me on Chinese cuisine versus Thai with such attitude.  \"Excuse me?\" I thought to myself, \"Does Orient equate with Chinese?\"  I asked if she had ginger tea.  She said there was only one tea in a yelling tone, and I had better be okay with that!  Finally I ordered the Miso soup.  It came in a very small bowl and was not hot enough.  I asked for the tea twice, since it appeared she did not hear me.  She barked at me with the equivalent, \"Alright already.\"  She plopped it on the table.  Later, when I was finished with my soup, she put her fingers all over the tea nossle.  That was effective in making me leave promptly.  Again, my body language communicated, \"Check please!\" but she chatted with the sushi chef, never letting him get a word in edgewise.  I waited another agonizing 5 minutes for the check and left a 1cent tip.  I mumbled \"Never again!\" as I left, determined to never frequent this establishment, and to discourage all of my friends and family to steer clear.  As I drove around the back, the kitchen staff stared at me in an unwelcoming manner.  I had never had such an experience at a restaurant in my life before.",

    "text": "TL/DR: Best Chinese Food in Pittsburgh  Orient Kitchen's carefully prepared dishes are full of authentic flavor so often lacking from dishes served by Pittsburgh's ethnic restaurants where everything has become lazy, bland, and sugar laden. Even dishes where sweet is the goal, Orient Kitchen serves them full of texture and with a welcome complexity and depth of flavor.   I recommend the General Tzo's chicken as a first go, then branch out. Their pork fried rice, hot and sour soup and ginger chicken are all quite good as well.   I'll be back and will recommend to friends and family.  Bonus points for value: the weekday lunch is just 7.95 for rice, a main dish, soup and hot tea!",

Below is a brief listing of what I tried:  Pan fried seafood noodles:  True to tradition, the edges of the egg noodles are delicate crispy and soft where the sauce meets the noodle.  Plenty of seafood toppings though I think there should be a few more shrimps.  Long clams (razor clams) - I really do not know any place that has this and it is a must have.  Cooked just right and not rubber and the right spices here.  Live lobster made your way!  Ginger and scallions or the salt and pepper method with a reasonable price based on size is also a must here.  Fresh steamed fish, also live from the tank!  Nothing beats fresh.  I totally recommend for a traditional Chinese feast. They have been in business here for a long, long time...",

From all the reviews, seems like their food is great but they have terrible service, which is why I opted for take out.  So I got the General Tso's chicken lunch special and that comes with white or fried rice and your choice of a soup! For $7.95 before tax, that's not a horrible price and I think their portion sizes are pretty decent.  I did not really enjoy my General Tso's chicken. I don't know exactly what it was but it's waaaaay too sweet and also there's a weird fishy aftertaste. They probably used too much fish sauce in the sauce but the surprising fishy aftertaste made eating the food very unpleasant for me... but the chicken itself is fried very well and you get a lot of it! But I just don't enjoy the way they make their General Tso's chicken. The hot and sour soup was pretty good and had a good consistency, which is rare to find.  I interacted with a young woman for less than five minutes but she was really nice and polite to me. Not enough to form a full opinion, but I didn't have any issues with the brief service I received. I hope to stop by again and try some of the other food on their lunch menu since the general Tso's was a miss.",

(Sorry for listing generic items; I forget the exact names of some of the dishes.) Everything is average to good.   There are a lot of negative reviews about the service here and that's definitely understandable. But I doubt it's personal, so I don't think much of it now.

One time when they first opened we had delicious sherbet for dessert and when we went back and tried to order she yelled at us and said they've never served dessert there. Just have to laugh it off.

In the evenings, there aren't many people so I feel like I'm guaranteed to get a table for dinner. The service is quick and very friendly. The food is great; not greasy. I personally think they have the best wonton soup in this area. The broth is full of strong flavor and the wonton is soft with tender pork on the inside. The shrimp fried rice is my go-to. I have a friend who really enjoys their general tso tofu so tofu is an option as well; he's also a fan of the egg drop soup.

The aforementioned woman is usually pretty rude but whatever.

My friend politely asked her why that happened to me while we were ordering tonight and she proceeded to say that if we are so poor we shouldn't be eating in her restaurant. She went on to say that she's rich and has a big house and doesn't care if we are in her restaurant or not. She didn't leave it there, she went on to the next table to talk about us. Jokes on you lady! You just talked shit about me to my friends who also happened to be eating, haha!  Oh yeah lady, one more thing, careful when you talk about customers in front of their faces. Some of us white people can speak Chinese too. I know what you said about me. You've been warned.  1 star but should really be 0.0000000001 stars.",

Not only that, but when they cheat you with the receipt (When the values on the receipt for match the values listed on the menu. OR when they give you rice without asking them charge you for it), at least Chinese speakers can argue the Chinese written receipt.   That said, service by the lady was terrible. A drop of spicy mayo was spilled while we poured it on the sushi, and she made a snark sound while making a face while standing at the table with us. She told US to move our plates and to \"Hurry up\" so she could put more food on the table. She rushed us the entire time and i never felt comfortable until we were finally eating. The only offset was the gentle man who helped with serving.   The ONLY reason i will give them a 2 star rather than a 1 star is because their food was better than the average Chinese restaurant.   I'd never thought I'd write a review, let alone a mean one. That said, this place really ticked me off and ruined my family's experience. 10/10 won't eat here again.",

However, if you are not familiar with the menu and don't speak Cantonese, you are likely to get bad experience with their service. As many reviewers mentioned, the lady owner is likely to be rude. That's why the overall review stars goes down to only 3.   To avoid this bad experience, don't expect that you will be treated like a typical good restaurant should do. Think that the rudeness is her style (even it's not acceptable). Just ignore her bad service. Don't ask her too much about the menu, but a few questions are still ok. Don't rush her. If you are not in a good mood, don't go there. If you won't go with Chinese friends and want to explore some unfamiliar dishes, you should do some research or check out their menu first.  Some recommend dishes: Peking Duck Salted Baked Squid with Hot Pepper Salt Baked Pork Chop Seafood in bird's nest (Stir fried seafood with vegetable served in a deep fried taro basket) Shrimp with mayonnaise (deep fried shrimps  tossed in sweet mayonnaise) Half Boiled Chicken with Ginger Sauce (bone in) (tastes like you dip boiled chicken in a soy sauce mixed with ginger) Etc.",

Their salt baked squid melts in your mouth and has the perfect crunch -- I guarantee it is nothing like the fried variant you'd find at other restaurants.    Their short ribs, pan fried flounder, and spicy chicken with basil are all delicious. Those are my go-to dishes. Unlike the other clients, I've never had any issues with the service here. The food here is great.",

    "text": "The reason why I'm giving Orient Kitchen 4 stars is for just one of the dishes I had there: Sauteed Shrimp with Crisp Milk. WOW, it was so delicious. Crisp milk is basically fried condensed milk and it is a crisp donut with condensed milk inside. You can also order just a plate of them. Surprisingly they're light, fluffy, creamy, and super crispy - the perfect custard donut. And since you can get it with shrimp, it's a savory and sweet dish that really entertains your taste buds.  Their other food is just okay, but I would go back just for the Crisp Milk.",
