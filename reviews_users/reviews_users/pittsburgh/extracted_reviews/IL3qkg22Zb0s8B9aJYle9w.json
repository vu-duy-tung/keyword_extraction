I had the breakfast sampler and she had the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo. Both dishes you can tell were homemade with quality ingredients. One of the best quesadillas we have ever eaten even after living in Phoenix for 2 years being surrounded by excellent Mexican food. We also loved the diner ambiance and color scheme that brought a smile to our daughters face.",

My boyfriend and I stopped in for breakfast this morning and we are both kicking ourselves for not getting here sooner!! There were so many great options on the menu and some fantastic specials, it was really hard to choose. You could tell anything you ordered was going to be great! We finally narrowed it down. He got the sausage and cheese omelette, complete with toast and home fries, and a side of corned beef hash (his favorite). I ordered the 2 eggs sausage and toast, complete with home fries. We also split a stuffed French toast...because how do you pass up cream cheese stuffed goodness?! The portions were perfect and so filling. Eggs were cooked to perfection, home fries delicious and well seasoned, the bread was local and soooo fresh! The hash was some of the best I've ever had, the sausage was delicious, and the coffee was amazing. There aren't even words to describe how insanely good the special French toast was. Topped with fresh berries and whipped cream...HEAVEN!!  Everything there is scratch made with love and it shows!! Our sever was a sweetheart, and very attentive. in fact, the entire staff was extremely friendly. We also got to meet one of the owners, Colleen. She was very warm and welcoming and treated us like family. In my mind this is THE diner in Coraopolis. We will DEFINITELY be going back for more!!",

The bacon was perfectly done and I received a nice portion. I thought the home fries were really well prepared. I was asked if I wanted peppers and onions in the home fries and I'm glad I said yes. The eggs were as ordered. They serve a great Mancini's marble rye that was delicious (choice of at least three types of bread). My server couldn't have been nicer or friendlier. I was also greeted by the owner (Tootsie's daughter) and she was also very friendly. The staff was welcoming (some greeted by name) and friendly to the five tables around me.  This is a great diner that is a new favorite!",

The owners, brother and sister are nearly always around, pitch in when needed, and are very likeable.  Now...the food...is WONDERFUL!!  Everything is well-presented, hot and fresh.  This place makes the best pancakes I have EVER had--fluffy, tender, and just delicious.  Everyone there knows me now, and they remember how I like things, which is nice.  I tend to be VERY particular, and they are patient with me...they have yet to call me a pain in the ass.  To my face, in any event!  Thus far, I've had breakfast on every visit, bit I've seen a lot of lunch items go by, and they all look and smell great.  Come here.  Really, you'll be happy!",

    "text": "Let me do this review while I still have a belly full of hamburger.  What a treat.  I was feeling a little sorry for myself, having had to open my wallet for a nice chunk of change to have some work done on my car today.  The owner of that car shop (which I will also review) was kind enough to give me a gift certificate to Tootsie's Diner to have breakfast on him.  I had already eaten breakfast, so I decided to use it to grab lunch instead.  I was encouraged by both the local endorsement and all of the positive reviews, and I'm pleased to say that my expectations were more than met.  Fast, friendly service, and great food.  I went with a bacon cheeseburger and upgraded to onion rings.  That burger was so juicy and flavorful, and as it turns out, the owner told me that he mixes the hamburger with brisket.  Wowza.  Warm, buttery brioche bun, and the good thick bacon too--not that skimpy stuff you see in pedestrian buffet lines!  Whoever described the onion rings as being like doughnuts pretty much nailed it.  They're cut very thick and must be hand battered right there at the restaurant.  Not too greasy, and served with a side of special sauce that's very similar to bloomin' onion sauce at a certain steak joint.  As I looked around, I could tell that this was a local hangout.  Families, workers on their lunch break, friends, and at least one other lone diner besides myself.  I'm going to have to try it out for breakfast or brunch sometime, because I'm sure it's on point.",

Cute interior design reminded me of an old 50's diner. The people were all great. Friendly, happy and helpful. Go here if you are in town.  And they have the cleanest restrooms I've ever seen in a restaurant.",

We sat at a table outside because it was full inside (10:00 AM on a Sunday). A little noisy with the trucks and all, but fun to be at a sidewalk cafe in Coraopolis!!  Service great, food great, a place I will be sure to come back to every time I am in the area.",

    "text": "Have you ever just wanted to like a place so much you tried to overlook problems or made excuses for things that were not quite right? That is what I did with Tootsie's. The place is cute, unique, and very conveniently located on a road that we frequently travel. Seemingly the kind of \"go to\" place that's nice to have nearby. It's small, but clean and kind of cool. The waitstaff is friendly and attentive. So far, so good. First glance at the menu shows they have some interesting selections, but the prices are about 20-30% higher than comparable places in the area. OK, maybe it's because the stuff is homemade or higher quality than normal. Maybe take one star off. Next came my initial order - Eggs Benedict! Looks great, except they somehow managed to wrap several strands of long black hair completely around the poached eggs (like over, under, and over again!) That turned my stomach but still, anybody can make a mistake, so, take off another star and vow to come back again.  This morning, we tried again. To be fair, my wife had the special, a breakfast quesadilla and it was quite good. I had the steak and eggs, figuring at 13-14 bucks it should be pretty good. When it arrived, it was oddly plated, though pretty. Oddly, the steak was cut for me into bite sizes on the bias. Not my preference, but maybe OK for presentation. It didn't take long to figure out that it was meant to disguise an awfully cheap cut of meat. Thin and so full of gristle it was inedible. The eggs were ordered over easy, but not raw. All of the eggs were surrounded with that slimy clear liquid in which the salmonella (I presume) lives before it is cooked out. The toast was thin, cold, and dry. Take of another couple of stars. So, 14 bucks for one bite of meat, and a bite if toast.  I sent the meal back and, since I again lost my appetite, did not want anything else. When we got the bill, there was no adjustment. Take off a few more stars (How do you indicate a negative rating?) The waitress eventually took off 4 bucks, so if $9 for a plate of crap sounds good to you, this is your place. If not, try any one of the other places nearby.",

Jenny Lee cinnamon french toast good but I don't know any place that serves the heel of the bread (not to mention I hate the heel!) and that piece was so tough I couldn't even cut it.  Eggs Benedict was good but really had no Hollandaise sauce because apparently what little they gave me slid under the potatoes.  Some of the thicker sliced potatoes were not cooked all the way otherwise pretty good with peppers/onions.  Stay away from the homemade donuts; very greasy and heavy - not to mention $2 each.  I'll stick to Dunkin Donuts at 99 cents for a better donut.    A bit pricey for what you get   Note:  No silverware or napkins for my to-go order and they should put the syrup in a souffle cup.  When I got home all the syrup was soaked into the french toast.",

Today was not that day, We went there about 10:00am  and we sat for 35 minutes waiting for the waitress to wait on us, didn't happen. A cook came out and got our drinks, then we were forgotten again.  A party of three came in and a party of two and then a man came in they all got waited on before my boyfriend and me.  Very irratated at this time.  Ten minutes later she got tired of the look on my face and came over to get our order. our food arrived we waited over a hour  this is just not right. My sandwich made the bun soggy, so it didn't get eaten and some of the grilled chicken look horrible. Will I eat there again.........maybe for breakfast. I was a waitress for 45 years and I never did that to a customer.  Wait staff needs help.",

Not sure if it's the kitchen staff but that's probably where I'd start. First off, as others have mentioned,  the potatoes are ALWAYS under cooked and hard. I mean, c'mon, they're potato chip thin. The only way you undercook them is if you just dont care about the quality of your product. Today I ordered the breakfast tacos. Scrambled eggs with chorizo sausage and cheese topped w/homemade salsa. Well, there was barely enough chorizo to claim it had chorizo. I think I tasted chorizo in maybe one bite out of two decent sized tacos. And your lucky if there was even a teaspoon of salsa on either. All in all, breakfast here is becoming disappointing. I'm afraid we're gonna have to find another breakfast spot. Shame too because this had been such a find.",

    "text": "I was not impressed with this place. My husband and I love to find the best local breakfast place, and when we do, we tend to frequent it a couple times each week. This is not that place.   Pros: cute decor, very busy so the locals must enjoy it, friendly staff, decent tasting coffee.   Cons: they were very busy so we waited awhile to be seated... they only have about 10 tables.   food was not that great. My \"home fries\" were not cooked. They literally sliced a potato and (tried to) cook it on the flat top grill. The pieces were still hard and flavorless-- a little salt goes a long way. I had the eggs Benedict. It was just okay.  The sauce was lacking... something.   I don't think we will be back.",

The server spent a fair amount of time on her cell phone delaying the service. The food gets a mixed review. It's took awhile to come but it's clear that it was freshly prepared.  The burger was delicious. No critiques- just delicious. The fresh cut fries were also good- just a little undercooked.  I never did get to try the \"special fry sauce\" offered on the menu. The coleslaw was just cabbage drowned in straight mayonnaise and maybe a small dash of vinegar.",

On a beautiful day you can sit outside and enjoy the location and not even think twice about the prices. Can you say double winning.  2. The prices,diner food, diner prices!  3. The service.   I decided to go with a breakfast burrito since for whatever reason I had really been craving those. Mines was ginormous! Full of flavor and served with A special salsa that really added that extra flavor I sometimes look for in breakfast foods.    Our waitress was extremely helpful and happy to answer any questions that we had. The only issue may be parking as I didn't see any dedicated parking and if it's a week day that may be an issue as there are other local businesses that are explicit in the \"no parking here\" rule. I will definitely be back when I make way back this way!",

He loved it but wished he ordered it well done for more crispy potatoes. I got the western omelette with hash brown. The hash brown was delicious with their own seasoning (onion powder mixed with salt and pepper). Out of all three orders, the pancake was the winner. Very fluffy and delicious! One star off for slow service. I had to ask for my coffee to be refilled. Another star off for no changing table. I'd come back to try a different dish though!",

I got the western omelet and asked for Swiss cheese, but it came with American. I was too hungry to wait so I ate it anyway. It was good... not flat like a pancake but pretty thick. Would recommend their omelets for sure. And you can't beat Mancini bread.  Unfortunately they didn't have cinnamon toast, which my wife loves. They had poached eggs (wife loves), but were out of fruit (not seasonal). The waitress was nice and cut her up a banana anyway (like a little baby).",

Depending on what time you go the pace definitely picks up and gets busy but it's worth it for a nice hot meal. I recommend if you're in the area plan to stop there and grab a bite! Say hello to Tracey our favorite waitress while you're there too!   Oh and last but not least -- Look for their \"After Hours\" nights. A lot of the photos I've included was from their special dinner experience that they do every-so-often. It's BYOB and a smaller menu but there's choices of apps, main dish, and dessert. Mmm mmm!",

Over priced and the server just kind of was annoyed we were there. I've had good service before though so maybe she just was having an off day. They don't have a parking lot, but there's usually plenty of street parking around! The place isn't terrible it's just kind of meh. I had the French toast and it was good. I've had better, I've had worse. But for the cost, it's just not worth it to me.",
