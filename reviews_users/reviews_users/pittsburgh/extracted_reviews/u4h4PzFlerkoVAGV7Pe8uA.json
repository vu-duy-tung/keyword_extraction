The char and quinoa were good but the brussel sprouts were not edible - overcooked to mush.  The server offered to bring a replacement side dish however she had waited til we were nearly done with our meal before checking if all was well so it was too late for a replacement. As much as we want to like this restaurant sadly we will not return.",

I can't truly put my finger on it, but I have tried a wide range of menu items and have never said to myself \"WOW!\" this is and incredible place. It's good but...is a common phrase out of my mouth here. The last time I was here I ordered a steak in an attempt to allow Luma to redeem itself after my last visit when I ordered a steak. This time the steak was cooked correctly, but there was some sort of off flavor of burnt on the steak. The steak wasn't burnt but it tasted like it had been burnt really weird. MY wife just orders the crab cakes every time and has never really had a complaint.   My advice is just go here and try it, great atmosphere and really nice wait staff. Also around Thanksgiving they offer buy one gift certificate and get one of equal value. We have done this for about 2 years now, but we can't see our selves doing this again.",

They have a seasonal menu, so be prepared for items to disappear but feel good knowing they are replaced with new exciting ideas. The ambiance can be considered romantic and upscale, white linens, collared wine bottles. There is a patio that is open in the warmer months and closed off/heated in the cool weather. Diners can't go wrong with the Stacked Chicken, Tenderloin Alfredo and English Toffee pudding for dessert. Wednesdays is half off wine by the glass or bottle. Rotating features I have enjoyed: duck apple ravioli, mahi mahi amandine, flank steak with chimichurri sauce, cajun salmon, muscovy duck breast, all too good! Owner Greg Ackerman always has a hands on presence and the staff is wonderful with suggestions. I recommend Taylor as your server :)",

What sets Luma apart from other restaurants is not only the beautiful decor with up lighting on the walls that changes colors but also the delicious food. Most recently hubs and I joined BIL and soon to be SIL for dinner on a Friday night during lent. We had reservations but surprisingly, the restaurant was only about half full. Every other time I have been to Luma it has been packed and we had to wait for half an hour. We started the meal with a bottle of pinot noir from the 25 for $25 wine menu. So many great choices for such a reasonable price. (FYI wine is 1/2 off on Wednesdays) In addition to the menu, which changes frequently, there were several seafood specials for Lent. I decided on the Spicy Shrimp Pasta entree and the zucchini fries as an app. The zucchini was crispy and delicious. My entree was was equally delicious with large shrimp, al dente pasta and tasty asparagus. My dining companions enjoyed their meals as well especially the seared Ahi Tuna salad. Service was professional and attentive. The perfect blend of getting you what you need while giving you space to enjoy your dining experience. In conclusion, Luma is a great place to go for a romantic night or a special occasion. Sign up for their emails and get frequent coupons for free wine or BOGO entrees. Also, Luma has a black Friday sale and gift cards are half off.",

We decided to use our Groupon coupon yesterday the 19th of Nov. at your 186 Castle Shannon Blvd. location.  We called for reservations, but was advised you were fully booked for the evening, however if we didn't mind, we were welcome to sit at the bar.  So we did arrive and low and behold there were two seats open at the bar where you have open seating.  We sat down got comfortable and before we could order a drink, your manager or host, who not very mannerly or professionally dressed, came over and said these seats are taken you'll have to wait for other seats to open up.  Why would you tell someone over the phone you can sit at the bar and when you arrive tell you the seats are taken?  Very embarrassing situation.  He told us we could wait but it may be an hour or so before any other seats open up at the bar.  Another couple arrived and he had them stand in the corner of the bar and offered to take a drink order.  20 mins later another couple arrived who seemed to have reservations.  Your gentleman took their coats, whispered quietly to them, offered them to order a drink and sat them in the two seats open at the bar.  Four other people came in after that with reservations and were sat right down.  I don't understand what was going on, but why did we have to be treated so rudely and unprofessional ?  This is a first of seats being reserved at the bar area.  After sitting there for a half hour, never spoken to again, we just got up and left.  If this is the way you would like your restaurant's reputation to be know as, I will certainly spread the word around.  I will also advise Groupon of my experience.  Highly disappointed without even being seated.",

We didn't have to wait for a seat, and it was much less noisy this time (though still quite dark, even seated closer to the bar).  Shared a bottle of moscato and a crabcake appetizer.  The crabcakes are phenomenal, but $13 for one cake with a bit of roasted red pepper aoli? No. I got the stacked chicken.  It was cooked perfectly, but the crispy coating was flavorless.  The only thing lending flavor was the spinach and feta between the two chicken breasts, and it was provided sparingly.  The multi-grain couscous was flavorless except for the sherry reduction sauce--again sparingly given. My husband got the filet--to be cooked medium well.  It came out charred in places and was medium rare.  There was red.  I get peeved when a place that charges as much as they do, being located in Castle Shannon, can't cook a steak to specifications. The dessert consisted of the date cake, which was actually quite good.  The cake was tender and not overpowering, though I really wish there were more creative dessert options, but that's a dessert lover talking.  In my second review of this place, I am actually disappointed for the above reasons.  I may consider going back there, but I first want to experience some of the other restaurants in the area that fellow Yelpers have shared.",

It was at least 15 minutes after we sat down to even SEE our server. She would disappear for at least 20 minutes at a time. We would order a drink and it would not show back up for like 15 minutes. 3 of the 4 of us ordered steak items and it was like 6 minutes after our meals came that our steak knives showed up. My medium rare filet tasted like liver ... The meat was barely pink but I didn't want to send it back because it would be another half hour or more to receive another one.  I'm extremely disgusted to have spend over $300 for four people and be soooooo disappointed. Nobody once apologized for the delays.  I entertain clients pretty frequently so I visit a lot of places ... I will not ever return to luma. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the other 3 people loved their meals and their dessert.  For me, service is as, if not more, important than the food. I can forgive if something isn't cooked exactly right when the service is outstanding.  This service could have not been worse.",

Started with Baked Brie in puff pastry with apricot with golden delicious apples and red grapes...very good starter.  Had a salad with a creamy danish blue dressing that was so tasty.  Had been told to try the crab cakes, so I did and was not disappointed, crab cakes were very rich and moist with at tangy red onion caper sauce.  Did I mention the crab cakes were great.  Fresh veggies came with the meal that were nice and crisp...perfectly cooked.  Shared a NY style cheese cake for desert that came with white chocolate mouse and raspberry sauce...the white chocolate mouse was very nice addition.  Some of the deserts are made in house but was told the cheesecake comes from a baker.  Wait staff was very attentive...to much so at times...took my wine glass with one small swig left in it...I usually like to leave it there for a while before finishing and next thing I know it was goooooone.

Do NOT ask for the table in the back of the dining room as it is rather impulsive/disgusting... what I mean is, you can literally see right into the ladies/women's bathroom because they do not have a separator/divider that stretches long enough to not see into it, so it is kind of weird and creepy.

With 22 wines for $22 ($11 on Wednesdays) and a great wine list otherwise, you're sure to get a good bottle of wine at a reasonable price, which is rare in restaurants.   I have been to Luma on two occasions now and I really desperately want to love it, but the food is holding me back . Let me get that out of the way.  For appetizers, we had the zucchini roulade, which is really excellent and not as heavy as it would seem considering that you're talking about something that is fried and covered in sauce.  I tried the macaroni and cheese and was unimpressed - there were huge chunks of chicken in it that were not seasoned and didn't add to the dish.  The goat cheese puff sounds amazing on the menu but in real life was also underwhelming - it mostly tasted of the mushrooms that accompanied it.    For a main course, I first tried the tenderloin alfredo.  This is a serious dish for a serious appetite.  Although it combined most of my favorite things - steak, pasta, and alfredo sauce - I could only finish about 1/3.  The flavor was excellent.  On my second visit, I had the duck and apple ravioli.  The waitress assured me that it wasn't overly sweet, but it was.  It wasn't a bad dish, it just wasn't great.  Jenny ordered the veal cutlet, and it was amazing - I'll be getting it the next time.   What will bring me back to Luma is the atmosphere.  Last week on a beautiful spring evening, my friends and I relaxed on the spacious patio and had half-priced wine.  Even if the food tends toward the mediocre, it's hard to beat that combination.",

My grandmother lives right on Washington road, so when we go out to eat, we always venture to the usual Il Pizz or Sesame Inn, but now that we found this place, I think we have a new dinner and lunch stop.  The decor and atmosphere of this place is beautiful.  I honestly do not think I have seen a nicer and trendier restaurant recently.  The lighting and the bar is mind blowingly beautiful.  If you are old enough to drink you would love this place and the view from the bar.  Now the food hit the spot too.  The french onion soup and the crab bisque were both spot on.  My french onion had Gruyere cheese, which I really thought was a great touch.  Also, my stacked chicken meal was delicious.  There was even a real sized side portion of mouth-watering broccoli.  If you like chicken with mushrooms, this is the place for you.  Hell, if you like good food that is accompanied by a nice atmosphere, this is also the place for you!",

So, I was glad we made reservations.  Our server was polite, attentive and helpful.  My wife who is gluten sensitive was directed to a few menu items which were gluten free and the server said other items could be modified to be gluten free.  My wife had the Asian flank steak and I had the pork chop.  We both had salads.  The food was excellent.",

    "text": "We visited Luma on a weeknight early in the evening; when we entered there were a couple patrons at the small bar and one table with a party of two.  Despite all the empty tables we were seated right next to the party of two, which quickly became a raucous party of four when their loud friends arrived.  They were so noisy we were unable to hear our own conversation.  But as we didn't have reservations we decided to grin and bear it.  This was our first mistake, we should have asked for a different table.  The server was friendly and helpful and we had high hopes for a delicious dinner after perusing the menu. Unfortunately the execution was lacking.  I ordered a half portion of the roasted beet salad on which I could not taste any salad dressing.  My entree was the Saku tuna which was nearly inedible due to all the silver skin and gristle that was laced throughout it.  I could barely cut it even with the steak knife they gave me. Once I managed to get a forkful without gristle it was mealy and not pleasant to eat at all, the texture was all wrong.  And it wasn't cheap at $28 - I should have sent it back but I hate to do that.  My dining partner ordered the she-crab soup, which he enjoyed, and the crab cake salad which was fine although somewhat bland.  I ordered the winter sangria which was so sweet it reminded me of Hawaiian Punch.  Throughout our meal the table next to us continued their rowdy obnoxious behavior with no consideration for their neighbors. We were not offered dessert which I felt was strange.  Such a bad experience, never again.",

It seems that the kitchen might have been having an off night because the other table also had issue with the cooking of the food (sent their dish back twice which we also had to do)  What we sampled:   Bread (decent bread, nice that it was served warm, the oil didn't taste like anything.  We asked for butter and received some slices off of a stick that tasted like it was left uncovered in the refrigerator so gross).   Croque Monsieur appetizer (was just ok.  Very difficult to cut so we had to pick it up and eat it with our hands which caused all of the filling to come off in one bite.  Not easy to eat and plated with the saddest looking mixed greens ever (refer to picture)).   White Sangria (decent, a little to sweet, but an ok option)  Seafood pasta (probably the best dish of the night (that's not saying much) the salmon was overly charred in spots and tasted like old grill, but the sauce on the pasta was tasty).   Muscovy Duck Breast with Butterscotch Gnocci (the worst dish of the night.  Asked for the duck to be cooked per chefs request and got the most unevenly cooked piece of duck, one part was medium rare and the other was clearly well done (you could see the line) and the butterscotch gnocci where too sweet and definitely prepackaged)  Overall we didn't spend anything on the meal because they took off the duck from the bill and with the groupon it covered the cost.  We did leave a nice tip for the waitress because this definitely wasn't her fault.",

My wife ordered duck breast which I often avoid unless I trust the chef; many cooks overcook duck so it's dry - not the case with Luma. Moist and juicy. Dessert was a fruit creamcake - light and heavenly.  Waitress was attentive.  One annoying flaw:  the she-crab bisque while flavorful was lukewarm. The cod was skillfully-prepared was also lukewarm.  The food stood on the counter too long before serving.  With wine, the cost without tip was $80 - a bit pricey, but I will return.

The only reason I gave it 4 was because service was a little slow. Other than that, the food was amazingly good (and well worth the wait) and fresh.   I had the chicken dish with portobello mushrooms in a sherry wine sauce, lemon asparagus, and mashed red potatoes. The chicken was very tender, juicy, and flavorful. The potatoes were incredibly fresh and creamy with the skin on too. The asparagus was good, but not wow (how 'wow' can asparagus be?).   My husband had a meat dish - I think he ordered the tenderloin - and he said it was amazing. I tried it as we'll and it was delicious. He ordered it medium and it was cooked exactly as he had asked. Juicy, flavorful. No complaints. It was also served with fettuccine Alfredo. I honestly would order his dish just for the fettuccine alone. So. Freakin'. Good.   They have a great wine selection including a list of 25 wines for $25. The total bill came to $85.00 (excluding tip) and was worth every penny.   I recently went to Eleven in the Strip District and paid almost $200 (excluding tip) and thought it paled in comparison to Luma. If there were half stars I would have given it 4.5. Go. Now. Don't.

    "text": "Luma sits off the cobble stone road on Castle Shannon Blvd.  I was coming from Washington Road and BOOM there it was once I hobbled my car over the bumpy stone road.  The parking lot was packed so I had to find parking on the street which wasn't too hard.  It was a Wednesday night and this place was jumping.  We didn't have reservations but luckily we found seats at the bar which was crowded as well.  My friend had a Groupon which is why we came here.  It was also 1/2 priced wine Wednesdays...but we'll get to that in a minute...you'll want to stick around as this the primary reason I gave them 3 stars.  Lets start with the food.  My friend and I shared the calamari, which was very good although the portion seemed a bit small for the price.  I had the crab bisque followed by the vegetable stack entree.  The crab bisque was great, everything a crab bisque should be...creamy and flavorful, with discernible pieces of crab!  It's a bit heavy in that I was full from the calamari and bisque before my entree arrived.    As far as vegetarian dishes go, I would rate this as delectable and fresh!  From the few bites I took of the grilled portabella stuffed with kous kous and spinach accompanied by cauliflower, I could tell that a new standard had been set for my vegetarian moods!  The standout vegetable was definitely the portabella - it has a smokiness from being grilled but still firm and flavorful.  If you don't like mushrooms then stay away from this dish.    Since I was stuffed, I took most of the entree home to enjoy for lunch the next day.  Now on to the reason why I only gave them 3 stars.  So as I mentioned we had a Groupon and it was also \"wine Wednesdays\" where their wine (glass or bottle) is half priced.  But here's the kicker, you can't use these discounts in combination.    The Groupon already states that it's no good towards alcohol so what's the problem?!?!  Why can't we take advantage of the 1/2 priced wine (since we came on a Wednesday) and use the Groupon...and I get it, from a business perspective you want to make the $ from at least the alcohol if you're discounting the food but it's not very \"customer friendly\".  We even asked if we could put the wine on a separate receipt from our food - the answer, \"no\".  It's just something they can't do...more like won't do.  You have to choose if you'd like to use the Groupon discount or use the 1/2 priced wine discount.    This irked me because without the Groupon we wouldn't even be coming to Luma...are they taking this in to consideration?  I think they should re-think this strategy.  But as I mentioned, the food was very good so if you don't have Groupon issues then check it out.",

Let's start with the food - the menu looks good, but Luma fails to deliver on quality. While the food certainly wasn't bad, it definitely was not worth the price points given.  The roasted cauliflower was hard. My grilled pineapple was cold (when asked they said they grill it and then put it in the fridge...) and my dad's burger looked like something he could have gotten any chain restaurant.  The crab cakes were not extraordinary.   The service was meh. Our server was friendly but inattentive and slow. It took what seemed like forever to get butter for our bread basket (the bread was actually  pretty good.  Now my 'favorite' part of Luma was the decor.  It was trying to be trendy but the serve ware and the tables contrast greatly with the colored 'ambient' lights that changed colors throughout the restaurant from purple to blue to green.",

This is off the beaten path, so you'd expect it to be a bit \"neighborhood-y.\" Like an old house converted into a restaurant. But even though it may have been an old house, it is ultra modern inside. Then when you walk out back and it's a beautiful deck with a great setting in the back of the woods.   Expectations were then set high for such a pretty place. We hit a couple snafu's as a water glass was pretty dirty, then a wine glass came with floating specks of something inside. I think it might be time for a new dishwasher. But, we could shake that off with a great appetizer!  We ordered the baked brie, as it had been talked up in previous reviews. I'm no brie expert, but it just didn't have that bite it usually does. The outer crust was light and flaky, but the brie itself just didn't taste like it should. I wouldn't order it again.. womp, womp.  I ordered the seafood pasta in a tomato cream sauce. This dish was definitely the best, but still missing some flavor I thought it would have. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not great. I thought the large scallop was delicious, I just wish there was one more! There were two pieces of shrimp and mussels and a handful of crab, so it wasn't a total bust. With Bistro 19 and Il Pizzaollo up the street, I don't think I'd be running here again anytime soon. Well, maybe for the half off wine on Wednesdays. That's speaking my language! Plus, how you gonna mess up that?!",

To say as some have reviewed that there are different chefs, how about just saying there is NO chef, just someone with an Easy Bake oven.",

I ordered the crab bisque , as I am a big fan of seafood chowders and bisques. I was very disappointed. It was not creamy & thick, more like broth and thin. It also lacked any depth of flavor, actually it was quite bland.    My stacked chicken was decent, although the sherry sauce was flat and the jasmine rice was sticky and flavorless. I sampled my friends crab cakes and they were quite delicious.     I chose the toffee cake for dessert, another tasty treat.      Overall it was a decent meal ( except for the bisque & rice).  The menu is not too ambitious and the atmosphere is nothing exciting.     I probably won't be returning anytime soon. There are many other places to chose from that are not so pricey.",

You would think with the bustling atmosphere of Hitchhiker across the street, this place would take more of an advantage of their location. However, upon arriving at 920pm on Wednesday, we walked in the door and were told \"They were closed\". Lights were on, staff was there. It was really bizarre. I ate here once before and it's not that special to begin with especially when considering the other options in the area, however, this incident put the nail in the coffin for me. Here's a recommendation: Don't specifically advertise a special for Wednesday nights then close 40 minutes before your posted business hours.",

But my guess is that on any other night, it's a cute, quiet, cozy patio to eat on.   I wasn't incredibly hungry, so I decided on a salad and an appetizer rather than an entree. The salad was good, nothing crazy special. My appetizer was fried calamari. And it just wasn't very good. It needed salt and overall just lacked flavor. My husband had a spinach Alfredo dish with filet medallions. My husband loves everything spicy, and asked if they could make the dish spicy, which they happily did. It was delicious! I stole a filet medallion and wanted to steal more, as it was cooked nicely! He said they spiced up the dish well and overall it was a delicious dish. I would have to come back to get an entree for myself next time for a more well rounded review, but based on my husband's stellar pasta and steak dish, it's worth coming back again!",

We frequented the restaurant and mostly were accompanied by friends and/or relatives. We always promoted Luma to others.  Around Christmas 2016 we were offered the buy a gift certificate and get one free. We purchased $50 certificates during the promotion.  My wife and I stopped at the restaurant this evening and placed an order and presented 1 of our certificates. We were told by the waitress as we were settling our check that the certificate was invalid and that it had to be used by the end of 2016. We were never told this while purchasing nor is this information written on the certificate. We wanted to talk to the owner or a manager and no one was available to speak with us. We reluctantly paid the entire bill, including 20% tip and left.  Unless this situation is rectified with the owner we will NEVER STEP INTO THE LUMA MT LEBANON AGAIN.   We will also encourage our friends and relatives to do the same.",

I would not say that it is fine dining, but it is a nice, dimly lit, white tablecloth atmosphere (I especially like the outdoor seating) and I typically enjoy my food.  I do believe they have 2 different chefs, which could account for some inconsistency, and they seem to have some operational issues at times ( like not being able to accept Mastercard and forgetting to mention it to the customer).  The menu is small, but I have liked everything that I have tried.  I do think that on occasion they serve less than high quality meat (fillet and tuna).  Sometimes the fillet is amazing, but I did get it once at lunchtime when it was not so great.  I only go for diner service now and have yet to be disappointed.  4 stars is for being a decent dining option in this area without being too salty, greasy or rich (a big gripe of mine), having a more chef specialized menu than you would find at a chain, decent service and outdoor patio.",

    "text": "WOW!  I don't give out a lot of 5 stars because my experience with a restaurant has to be top notch. My whole experience was definitely top notch. My son and I had lunch there one day during the week. We always look for smaller places tucked away. This place was not exactly tucked away but there was a lot of construction going on around it. It's a part of a property that has 3 businesses-Hitchhiker Brewery, an attorney, and Luma.  When we walked in we only saw one table full of people. For a moment we were a tad skeptical of eating there but decided that the lack of customers was due to the construction. After we were seated a large group of ladies walked in to have lunch.  I ordered the Stacked Chicken and my son ordered the Entree Salad that was a Pittsburgh chicken salad-complete with fries.  We were given warm bread with some delicious dipping oil. It had herbs and Parmesan cheese. It was a great combo for the warm bread.  Our entrees came and they looked amazing!!!  The Stacked Chicken is two chicken breasts stacked one on top of the other. In between was feta and spinach. There was a finishing sauce on top of it. The chicken was fried but the sauce didn't take away the crispiness of the chicken. I'm not sure what was in the finishing sauce but it was wonderful!  I have never tasted anything like it. There was asparagus as the side and it was cooked perfectly. I took half of my meal home. Usually when you ref eat something it's not the same as when you first ate it. This chicken dish was just as good the next day. The chicken was even still juicy.  My son's salad looked really good. It had big pieces of chicken in it. But it was the dressing that elevated the salad. Again it was some of the best salad dressing. It wasn't a heavy ranch type sauce. It has to have been house made.  Fantastic food with fantastic service =5 Stars!!",

I've had the pleasure of trying and absolutely loving several of Luma's cocktails, its crabcakes, it crab-stuffed salmon, and it's Ahi tuna dish. I have never been disappointed. The seasoning and sauces that Luma uses completes its dishes of perfection. I even liked their scallops when I got to sample those, and I am not a scallop-loving person; something about the way Luma's cooks designed the dish elevates it to a level where even I like it.  I'm not sure why people are saying service is bad here, but I suppose off days happen. As for me, I've never experienced a grumpy face; the waiters and waitresses have always been extremely attentive and really helpful when picking a dinner item or a wine.  Before I wrap up I have to ask, does anyone know what the dessert menu here is like? I've never had any room after my meal to have any and I'm really curious about whether or not I need to come here to just enjoy dessert one of these days.  5 stars!",

Luma can just about always be found on groupon, which is always a good score.  We get the lunch groupon which gives you $20 for $10.  It never covers the bill, but its a start.    The food here is very good, but I feel as though its a tad bit inconsistent.  They have changed the way a few items are prepared, such as the stacked chicken dish and the fries were not the normal skinny little fries.  The stacked chicken appears to be battered now, as opposed to the previous times where it was grilled.  We loved the skinny little fries, but they must have just been out of product.    A few of this things I've tried have been the filet medallions over pasta, crab cakes, onion soup, fish sandwich, stacked chicken, and the house burger.  All the food is a high quality product, and I always leave a happy customer.    The restaurant is on the smaller scale, so I would suggest a reservation.  The patio is awesome.  We sit outside any chance we get.  I do however feel as though the interior has a bit of a sewage smell.  This isn't the first time I've noticed it.  It wasn't terrible, but not pleasant at the same time.    All and all, its a quality establishment, with a good quality product.",

    "text": "My dear mother, who somewhat resembles Ina Garten, called me last Friday night in a panic!  \"Darren! Darren! I have a Groupon for Luma! It's gonna expire! Luma, Darren! Luma!\"  \"Mum, calm down. What's Luma?\"  \"It's in Mount Lebanon, so it must be good! \"Did you Yelp them yet?\"  \"Um, no. I guess we can go.\"  \"It's for $40! Darren, it's gonna expire! I forgot about it!\"  \"Ok, ok, mum. We'll swing by and pick it up.\"  \"Dress nice. Don't go there in your work clothes. You can borrow one of your dad's...\"  \"Mum, I have some nice jeans and a sweater. Geez.\"  \"You have to make a reservation...\"  \"Ok, Mum...\"  \"And wear something nice. Make sure you take Kay...\"  \"Ooook, Mum...\"  In a little-traveled section of a modish South Hills suburb, one will find Luma (their secondary location is in Aspinwall) on a brick road near an oxidized underpass. Had I been dropped here blindfolded, I would think I was in the East End, and when the two of us strolled in, I still felt that way.   With the ever-changing lights on the walls that segued from a cool blue to an even cooler green put me at ease, Luma proved to be one of those restaurants where I knew I'd be in for a fantastic supper even before I had a fork in my hand, and partake in a fantastic supper we did.   An alabaster wedge of brie began this gourmet ceremony. Baked thoroughly, ideally, oozing, bleeding with a chutney of fresh berries and toasted walnut, we spread the cheese's gluey sludge onto crackers and luxuriated in smooth, lardy, tart essences, saving the waxy, pale cortex for last.   Before arrival, I scouted Luma's menu, and was immediately taken by The Billionaire Burger. Some would consider it to be a churlish dining choice in a restaurant like this, but its description and price (hey, I wanted to get the most out of my $40!) made it irresistible despite Kay's protests.  My doll would kvetch,\"You're ordering a burger? Here?\"   Hell yes I did! The Angus beef was newly ground, adorned with grill mark tiger stripes. Slathered on its underside was aioli. Draped atop the patty was the underutilized bibb lettuce, sweetly roasted tomatoes, and aged Beemster,  a Kaiser roll baked by the finest artisan and toasted by the deftest short order diner cook holding it all in. As juices and dressing dripped onto my hands, I knew I had to continue to eat this burger with silverware as more elegant weaponry was required for this very civilized beast in such baroque environs. I was Kenta Kobashi doing battle with Samoa Joe in a Big Apple ballroom...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5gEGHgqcsgA&s=ad0093c8f69344caa2215dc676107e167ac45464cf8cd56898a44bae7f79aa61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=5gEG...</a>  Caramelized vegetables clashed with crisped dough, acuate cheddar, creamy mayonnaise, and a medium rare, severely succulent ground protein to make for an elaborate burger for an elaborate palate in an elaborate setting. The frites were properly crisp ferrules of chip pan-cooked perfection. No regrets have I.   Kay partook in the cannily candied seafood celebration that was Stuffed Salmon. Flaky, moist, grilled without defect, and captured in the Bay of Fundy, the flamingo-colored fish was stuffed with heavy, humid jumbo lump crab meat and garnished with a Grand Marnier jelly for a fanciful touch. A spoonful of caviar would have been excessive yet welcome.   Dessert was the brownie sundae-turned-miniature souffle known as The Chocolate Saucy.  An exercise in simplicity, white and dark chocolate in liquid form was drizzled all over the whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, and the warm, spongy, salty chocolate choco-chip cake, forming a lake under everything. It's been done before but not with such class. After grandiosity of the preceding courses, all that was required was The Chocolate Saucy's sweet, sweet economy.   The complimentary sourdough bread was thickly cut, rich, porous, and served as a phenomenal vessel for the brie when the crackers were gone. Be wary of filling up on it for its impeccable quality can tempt you into doing so.   Our server was joyful, conscientious, adept, attentive, and had a culinary song in her soul.  Thus, we enjoyed her company. Enjoy Luma with some of your own and realize that Pittsburgh's South Hills are not to be dismissed by lovers of good, good food.",

    "text": "Holy Luma! This place is awesome.   So full disclosure, I live right down he street & have been to Hitchhiker brewing a handful of times (attached to Luma) BUT I have never even noticed this place. Thanks to GROUPON, I received $40 food voucher for $18. I will mention, that wine Wednesday ($5 glasses, and 1/2 price bottles) (and I'm sure all other specials) are not included with the voucher, you have to choose one of the other.  It's a hidden gem. When we arrived around 630 the restaurant was just starting to fill up. We weren't dressed properly (in the process of moving) so we sat at the bar area. The bar area is super nice, and the restaurant is lovely. Neon lights, very metropolitan vibe. The dining room is formal, cloth napkins, set tables, very nice! I even noticed an outside dining area in the back.  The bread, and dipping oil was phenomenal. Very fresh and you could tell that it was all homemade. The menu selection is giant, American fare with a combination of meal styles. Pork chops, steak, TONS of fish options ranging from Mahi Mahi to Sol (which is a difficult dish to find)  The prices were very reasonable. Low $20's for entrees, and I will tell you that the entrees are high quality. The Tuna was superb, and the wasabi mashed potatoes are something that I have never had but will talk about forever, because they were so unique and delicious!  If you're painting in cut off T shirts, you will feel welcome here. I like that about this place.  If you're planning a date night, this is a lovely spot.  All in all, if you want high quality food for a very reasonable price, with some friendly service, Luma may just be the place for you!",

The friendly server allowed us to eat out in the covered back patio where there was a nice breeze after some pouring rain.  Notes:  Server was actually from California and did acting before.  He was extremely nice and even offered to have our bread grilled since we liked our bread toasted.    Appetizer was their homemade crab cake!  Probably the best crab cake I have ever had thus far!  Perfected cooked, fresh abundant amount of crab and just the right combination of flavor.  Have this if you visit.  The two dishes we had were also delicious.  The barramundi fish and the Asian steak flank did not disappoint!  Lastly, to finish we had the toffee date cake!  Lovely end to the night!",

My husband had the pork chop special with white wine sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus. He couldn't get over how great it was cooked and so tender. He even picked up the bone to make sure he didn't miss a bite. :) I had the shrimp and corn chowder to start which was amazing as well and the spicy tiger shrimp entree.

Although the space was intimate and romantic, the food didn't really create an experience that matched the fancy restaurant feel (and not to mention prices). The hubby and I were here for restaurant week so we had the opportunity to sample at slightly lower prices.   The calamari was probably my favorite dish of the night; it was light, crispy, and flavorful. I especially liked the peppers in the dish. The most disappointing part of our dinner was our entrees. My cod dish was incredibly bland: almost as if they didn't use any salt whatsoever. The cod wasn't seasoned, served alongside unseasoned cous cous and asparagus, again unseasoned. My husband's chicken dish was dry, which our guess would've cost around $20 normally and for that kind of price, you'd expect the chicken to be prepared properly, right? Unfortunately our desserts weren't memorable and didn't quite redeem the poor quality of our entrees, but definitely were a slight step higher.   Well, at least they have 1/2 off wine on Wednesday's. I will probably be back for that but I won't be giving dinner a try there again anytime soon.",

I don't blame the waitress for that.  She appeared to be as accommodating as possible.  She brought wine, bread, and an appetizer in a timely manner.  In fact, I was pleased with the timing of the service at that point, having read reviews that this had been a problem.  Well, it turned into a problem at that point.  The kitchen was backed up and our entrees took forever.  We received them close to an hour and a half after were seated, or about an hour after we finished the appetizer.  Apparently, the kitchen is not good at timing the delivery of the food, either.  My panko stacked chicken was piping hot when it finally arrived, but my boyfriend's mahi mahi was lukewarm.  It must have been sitting on the counter until my chicken was ready.  I doubt we'll make a return visit.",

    "text": "Have been wanting to try this restaurant since we moved to Lebo 2 years ago. Having a hard time understanding why the reviews are so good. We made reservations and were seated right away but forgotten for 10 minutes before anyone came to our table. The bartender even \"adjusted\" the place setting of the empty table right next to us without acknowledging we were there. Once our waitress came over and we ordered a bottle of wine, it arrived very quickly. I believe our waitress was either new, inexperienced or dealing with a language barrier because the special was described to us very incorrectly. Besides the initial hiccups we were excited to see the choices the menu offered. Deciding on brussel sprouts to start then the wild mushroom ravioli for me and the stuffed salmon for the hubby. Well that's when things started going south. The Brussels were mushy and not seasoned. They had been boiled like my Mom used to make. Yuck. At least roast or deep fry please for some texture. The wild mushroom ravioli came swimming in oily sauce and was hiding a lump of spinach that had been boiled as well with a few cherry tomato halves hanging around. The large garnish of fried onions tasted as if they had been deep fried for too long and had been made last week. The stuffed salmon had a tasty sauce but was over cooked and the potato quinoa hash was glorified hash browns that desperately needed seasoning. We also waited a very long time between appetizer and entree. The pacing of the meal was off the entire night. For a higher end, more expensive restaurant I was not impressed. Would rather travel downtown to Union Standard or The Commoner and know I was getting good food and service for the price.",

On the friendly bartender's recommendation, I went with the 'Mango' which was delicious! My next drink was the 'Grapefruit' which was less sweet and even better than the first. The food too hit all the right spots! Don't miss the grilled cheese dippers - tiny bite sized grilled cheese with a yummy delicious tomato bisque dip - What a brilliant idea! Like sharing warm comfort with every bite! I also enjoyed the zucchini straws but the wild mushroom ravioli was truly just perfect! Service too was on point.

We said no and then waited almost ten minutes to be asked if we wanted anything. I ordered a captain and coke and was asked if I wanted that on the rocks. I am almost sixty and have never been asked that for a rum and coke. When our party showed up my wife and sister in law ordered two of their specialty drinks. They were so bad as to be absolutely undrinkable. They did take those off our bill. The appetizers were ok. My wife and I ordered filets with their special butter medium rare. The food was barely warm. The soft butter that was on top of the filet didn't melt. My wife's filet was done almost medium well. It took a long time to get our food and was told it was because they had a large party on the outside patio. This place came highly recommended by my sister in law and her husband but half of our group was underwhelmed. To say that this was a disappointment would be an understatement.
