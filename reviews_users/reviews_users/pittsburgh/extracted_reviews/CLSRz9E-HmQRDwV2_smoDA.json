I only order gyoza as grocery store sushi is better than theirs. I travel a lot and i am used to variation on sushi but this was just not worth the expense. Last trip for gyoza got me very dry inedible filling. Not sure what happened and i assume it was a one time thing since all other times the gyoza was wonderful.",

    "text": "I'll come right out and admit I'm a huge nerd. I like to read, no matter where I am, and I carry two notebooks for journaling and jotting down project ideas.   I'm also a big fan of sushi. If it's within my (now rather meager) price range, I'll make it a point of seeking out a restaurant I haven't been to before.  I've been to Ichiban a number of times now, and I have to say that it is an excellent place to visit. The interior is gorgeous, the lighting low, the music not too loud. There are three dining areas - the sushi bar, the general dining area and a very large separate room for hibachi that houses several tables capable of accommodating large parties.   The thing that really stands out for me about Ichiban Waterworks is the staff. After having lunch there once or twice both the hostess and the waiters remembered me and, having taken notice of my odd reading in public habit, made sure I had a table with the best lighting possible. They are always friendly and make me feel comfortable, visiting the table enough to make sure I have tea and water but not hovering over it.   The food at Ichiban is incredible. The sushi lunch is extremely well-priced. For lunch you can order soup, salad and two rolls for around eight dollars, and for the same lunch plus an additional roll you'll be paying around eleven dollars. Not too shabby. The list of rolls to pick from is long and full of delicious combinations. My favorite so far have been the eel and cucumber, the spicy tempura and the eel and avocado.   The spicy tempura alone is worth visiting Ichiban for. Yellowtail is lightly dipped and fried, not too heavy or oily, and rolled with just enough pepper-infused mayo to give it a kick. I've found myself jonesing for it more than once and have had to make a pick up order to get my fix. It really is that good. The miso is perfect and the ginger dressing on the salad is delicious.  I've only had hibachi there once, for a friend's birthday party, but I can safely say that it was one of the best hibachi experiences I've had. The chef was friendly, the food was great and the quantity of it was amazing. I was surprised at the time that I could put it all down, to be honest.   Sushi purists may turn their noses up a bit at the idea of a place that serves hibachi, sushi and general entrees in one place, but the price is right, the staff is awesome and the location is incredibly convenient. My only complaint is that they don't serve lunch on weekends, but quite a few restaurants observe this practice and, honestly, they're probably busiest on Saturdays.   I can't vouch for their drinks because I've never had alcohol there, but the bar is gorgeous, the first thing you see when entering the restaurant, with a tall replica of a New York skyline etched in glass situated directly behind it. I'm not sure why there's a glass wall of New York inside a Pittsburgh sushi bar, but it's lovely.  In short, it's a great place to go to sooth a sushi craving, and you'll never find a better restaurant tucked inconspicuously in a strip mall.",

Although, the waiters are nice barely understand English. Don't think we will comeback.",

We found our waitress rushing to take our order and then brought our appetizer at the same time she brought our dinners.  Both the mens and the ladies room were dirty and appeared to have a plumbing leak as both the floors were wet all along the walls and toilets additionally my husband stated there were no paper towels.  There were fruit flies buzzing around our table throughout the meal.  The sushi was just ok.  I found it to be \"thick\" and the fish wasn't sliced with any type of care.  Anyway, the enitre experience was poor and I have been at high end sushi establishments and found the prices to be the same for less quality....Anyway, never, ever going back",

My fiance and I had the full hibachi dinner, and it was as good--maybe even better-- as the similar meal that I had at Ron of Japan in Chicago. I ordered the red snapper hibachi dinner, and it was delicious. The accompaniments (shrimp, soup, salad, vegetables and rice or noodles) were good, too, especially the miso soup. The salad was a small one, comprised of overdressed iceburg lettuce.  My fiance ordered the shrimp and steak hibachi dinner, and he was pleased.   The service at Ichiban was excellent, and the fellow dinners who were at our table seemed to enjoy their meals. One detail at Ichiban that I especially liked was that people sharing the same grill top were not situated too close together, making it less awkward. In all, I had a pleasant, impressive experience.",

    "text": "so hubby and i have been in pittsburgh for almost 2 whole months now. and this is pretty much the best meal we've had eating out so far. however i'm only basing this on the food we got that day: i ordered the sashimi lunch (12 pieces of asst. sashimi) and hubby ordered the spicy girl roll. maki rolls with fresh salmon, yellowtail, and avocado with spicy tuna and tempura batter crumbs to top it off.   sashimi lunch: it comes with either a soup or a salad. i chose the salad. it was a simple generic iceberg lettuce with some shredded cabbage and carrot salad with an interesting tomato-y dressing. the sashimi was really good, especially for the price. for only $12, i was able to get 12 pieces of sashimi. and their sashimi slices are incredibly generous, especially for japanese restaurants. their slices are at least DOUBLE the size of typical sashimi slices from most japanese places. i got 3 slices each of tuna (red), white tuna, and salmon, and seared tuna (red). the raw tuna and salmon were the best. they were so soft they almost melted in my mouth. the salmon had quite a bit of white striping on it, but it wasn't fibrous and still tasted good. those two were incredibly fresh and not fishy-tasting at all (the sign of old fish that's been sitting around for a while). the white tuna was alright, but not as soft and fishier. the seared tuna would have been amazing if it was hot off the pan, however it was cold. perhaps it was seared yesterday? but it's a great value for the price. hands down the thickest sashimi i've ever had!  spicy girl roll: hubby accidentally ordered the wrong thing. he thought it would have fresh pieces of salmon laid over the outside of the roll, however it was tuna and tempura batter crumbs mashed up in a thick layer over the top. i think they put some hot sauce on top too. it was pretty good. the avocado inside was fresh, and the salmon and yellowtail tasted fresh as well. so not bad for an unintentional order. that and their rolls are decently priced. $10.95 for this one. i believe they have a lunch special menu with simpler rolls where you can get 2 for $8 or $9.   they plate pretty well. both our orders came with a lovely purple dendrobium orchid and some parsley for a touch of greenery. my sashimi order came on a large square glass bowl atop a bed of shaved ice with a mound of shredded white daikon radish, greenery, and the orchid. hubby's had the orchid, parsley, with sauce artistically drizzled over his rolls.   also, their decorations are pretty nice. i have to agree that it is kind of surprising considering the exterior of the location (i.e. in a strip mall with a non-descript sign outside. however, once you walk in, it's actually pretty nice inside. it is well lit, not too bright or too dim. and there are cherry blossom branches peeking out in a row along one wall and the partitioning screens between each seating area are nice too. the bar has a large glass piece with a dramatic bridge landscape frosted into it. we had a nice and attentive waiter, who didn't rush us at all. the portions are pretty good, especially in terms of sashimi. hubby and i had a hard time finishing all our food. we were sadly too full for dessert. we actually contemplated taking leftovers home, but then figured it wouldn't do well in the heat and we wanted to run other errands too. so we over-stuffed ourselves. definitely plan on coming back for more sashimi. it seems to be quite rare to find this quality at this price in pittsburgh of all places. and trust me, we know japanese food when we see/taste it! hubby is half japanese, and my grandma thinks she's japanese (japanese education).",

So he had to wait until the scallops were cooked, while the rest of his food sat cold. After dinner he asked for the manager, who advised it was policy to give back the food. I told him it was the tackiest thing I ever seen or heard and they will never again get our business. Thanks for losing a loyal customer!",

    "text": "A large group of us came here for a going-away party for one of our coworkers, and I will start by saying that Ichiban can certainly acommodate a large group well.  They have a separate, back room for even bigger parties, but the hibachi tables can easily seat most large groups without a problem.  I'm not a huge fan of hibachi, so my husband and I got the sushi instead.  I liked that we were able to order something other than hibachi but still sit with our group, although we got our food later than everyone else at our table, because the sushi bar was apparently a bit backed up.  I had the miso soup to start, and it was perfect.  Additionally, it was really cheap, which I appreciated, since we were all sampling martinis with our meals, which were a little pricey.  We also got an order of the crab rangoons, which were excellent: creamy on the inside, and crisp and crunchy on the outside.  Our waitress Kiki tried really, really hard to keep on top of drink refills and delivering the non-hibachi orders to our table, but it seemed like they had her working with our group, and also another table farther down in the restaurant, so I felt bad that she had to keep running back and forth.  She was also really sweet about taking a group picture for us after we were done with our meals.  The sushi was quite good overall.  They have a lot of specialty rolls on their menu, but we were trying to keep our dinner a bit light, so we went with a few standards (California, spicy tuna, and shrimp tempura rolls).  We did try one order of the 'beauty and the beast' roll, which had avocado, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail.  It was super meaty and delicious.  Next time, I swear I'm going to try the Steeler roll just because I'm that much of a yinzer.  :)  One thing I found odd was that occasionally, these rainbow-colored lights on the ceiling would flash and the music would shift to some loud, peppy song.  After about the third time this happened, I was able to make out that the song was \"Happy Birthday,\" apparently sung in Japanese.  I know this makes me a supreme nerd, but I like the idea that on your birthday at Ichiban, they give you a few moments to feel like you are the star of an Anime film.  I kind of wished they had a 'bon voyage' version of that to play at our table!  Some pointers if you're going to try Ichiban:  ~ The one at the Waterworks is actually IN the strip mall.  I almost drove right past it, thinking it was going to be one of the standalone restaurants across the parking lot.  That said, the interior is SO much classier than I would have expected from a strip mall restaurant.  ~ They do coupons in things like Clipper magazine.  We had a coupon for 15% off our sushi order, but there are also deals like 10% off your hibachi order, and free stuff on your birthday.  ~ If you're doing a big group event, you can arrange to bring your own cake.  We did a 'bon voyage' cake for our guest of honor, and they sliced it for us and everything.  All in all, I liked it.  We are searching for a replacement for our favorite sushi place here in Squirrel Hill, which just closed.  I don't know if we'll make the drive over to Waterworks again soon, but I thought the place was just as good as pricier hibachi/sushi places like Nakama.",

    "text": "As soon as my date and I walked in, I instantly felt as if I was about to face the late Mitsuharu Misawa with a valet at my side. I swore I could have seen streamers flying about. Down the ramp I walked into what my imagination allowed me to pretend was The Egg Dome.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5ANvKlcT6F4&s=fce5f0b698eab7d018166066450bdf8d951b4953ac02151e97352a8ed4a8bf4b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=5ANv...</a>  Ok, ok, that was obligatory.   Anyway it was her idea, and it was a good one.  I found Budokan at the Waterworks strip mall of all places, and Loudness and X-Japan were the dual headliners.  For the first time in my life I threw the horns at a chef.   And he threw 'em back!!!  So yeah, I never did the hibachi thing before.   Well, it began unassumingly. I got a Emperor's Combo. She got Hibachi Steak.  You start out with soup and a small salad. The soup, called Clear Soup, looked like water with some wood chips in it, but upon first sip I realized what a perfect example of the sublime economy of Asian cuisine this was. It was utter ambrosia. Broth, mushrooms, and scallions -- that's it. Nothing else was necessary. I could wake up to it each day.   The salad was crisp, fresh, and some kind of tasty orange dressing on it Thousand Island?   Then came the samurai, his blade kept in a sheath at his side, his silent company making itself known with swift actions.   The family that dined with us (I had forgotten how much fun eating with complete strangers can be) were jolted into attention when the chef created a blaze in the middle of the grill with sake.   He squirted some in my mouth!  Hell yeah! He got some egg on me too, but if Ozzy Osbourne sweats on you in your front row seat, do you complain?   Yes, we got the onion volcano. That's like waiting for Iron Maiden to play \"The Trooper.\" It's a staple of the set, man.  Theatrics aside, everything was amazingly good. There's nothing like eating dinner cooked this quickly, this ready to eat, because it's ingeniously cut into bite-sized pieces. And get this, you can dip your morsels in a \"Japanese mayonnaise\" and some other gingery/peanut sauce, both of which defeat any and all American condiments.    At first we were served the fried rice complete with the egg-cracking tricks, then noodles, veggies. We each got two pieces of shrimp.   Y'know, I hadn't had lobster in ages. The last time I got it (at a certain South Hills seafood dive I haven't been to in a few years) it was overcooked, tough. This lobster on the other hand was flawlessly plump, tender.   I mean, everything I had from the grill was caramelized goodness. I loved how the chef pressed the noodles and rice onto the hibachi as if they were burgers.  My chicken, pieces of which I couldn't catch in my mouth when the chef catapulted them, was awesomely appetizing also.   What a way to cook! Having only seen this sort of thing on television before, I never realized what a rockin' experience this is for all the senses.  You should have seen the little triplet girls at our table, their mouths and eyese agape, transfixed on this culinary warrior from the Far East.   If I had one regret, it's that I didn't order the steak, but I did taste my date's. I would have learned to love steak much, much earlier in life if I had it the Ichiban way: small, tender, juicy meat cubes. The side sauces just made them that much better.   My date didn't know what \"Ichiban\" meant. Man, what you can learn from pro wrestling.   #1 indeed.  And to think I was just gonna order sushi.",

But the Waterworks sushi has been consistently delicious for the last couple of years since we've been dining there. Haven't tried their hibachi but the sounds from the other room make me believe it's entertaining at least. The environment in the non hibachi side is quiet and lovely. Service is always excellent. And there is a full bar!   Added bonus: Ichiban does take away. Sushi dinner for two is our go to meal.",

The hibachi was fine, but the one thing that did disappoint me about the sushi was that I had ordered my roll specifically because of the masago on it, and the masago turned out to be almost like a dusting of either really tiny or crushed masago, no flavor there whatsoever and not at all like the juicy round balls I'm used to... One upside though is that somebody had a birthday, and they put on this epic music and had flashing disco lights and a dessert with a big flaming sparkler for the birthday boy, and it was a pretty cool experience for him I'm sure, much more elaborate than most other restaurant's bday celebrations",

    "text": "Ichiban is extremely overpriced for the quality of food you get.  However that is not what prompted me to write this review (I only recently joined Yelp)....  Our family has a tradition of eating out on Christmas day evening.  Two years ago we chose to eat at Ichiban in Waterworks because it is asian food/hibachi & because it is very close to our home.  This was not our first time and I was extremely underwhelmed previously.  But I thought on such a slow night our service would be better, even though I was expecting the same quality of food.  I was not wrong on those counts.  But this was new.  As we were leaving and putting on our coats at the front door, our server approached us with our bill in hand.  She held it out to us and asked if the tip amount is what we meant to leave.  I immediately assumed that she was calling our attention to a math mistake.  NO!!!  She was letting us know - by chasing us down across the restaurant,  mind you -- that she didn't think we'd tipped her enough!!!    We are a family of 4.  The service was adequate, or less so considering there were not many tables to serve.  We tipped 15% of the bill total.    I was shocked.  I've never seen or heard of this happening to anyone before.    My husband, who is a kind man, gave the waitress more money in cash.  I would not have.  I was appalled that she would do this.  I have not and will not ever eat at Ichiban again.",

    "text": "If you want bargain sushi, come here for lunch.  Actually... if you want to just stuff yourself silly come here for lunch.  I don't think the \"lunch portion\" is actually a lunch portion.  Or if it is, I can't imagine how big the dinner portion is!  The best part is you can order up two rolls of sushi for $8.  No, you did misread that!  $8 gets you all the rolls you want... or at least what's on their designated list for that price.  I was sad to see the yellowtail not included, but whatever, I can settle for spicy tuna and a philly roll.  They were decent, definitely a notch above Giant Eagle or Whole Foods but not even close to my beloved Penn Ave Fish Company!  For lunch you can eat like a king for around $10-15 at the hibachi, depending on what you get. I wasn't really a fan of the salad (which had dressing DUMPED on top) or the miso soup (tasteless).  But the lunch was okay.  I ordered scallops, which were nice and fat with about six of them cooked up.  You also receive a hefty portion of fried rice and noodles but they scrimp on the mixed veggies.    If I was around Ichiban and was craving sushi, I'd be down to order up a couple rolls.  Perhaps more than two or more than 4 or... the skies the limit really!",

Most of the time there is a gathering of people at the entrance waiting for a seat but we always opt for the normal dining room side (same old Hibachi chef tricks at a table with strangers, no thanks). Our servers have always been pleasant and our meals came out in a timely fashion. The sushi is inexpensive and good, but it's nothing to write home about. We typically order their huge portioned hibachi dinners, which seem to come with even more food than the hibachi side of the restaurant. Overall its a good place to go if you're craving some delicious hibachi standards but it carries the typically inflated hibachi price tag.",

    "text": "This was a visit from 7 months ago but there's 2 listings for this restaurant....  Let me start by saying that I have never been told not to come back to a restaurant as I was heading out the door and I'm no spring chicken, jus sayin.   Just so there is no confusion, I've dined in and purchased lunch takeout on many occasions from Ichiban. Mainly I would get Hibachi or some sushi and Gyoza on my previous visits and it was quite tasty. Sadly, today's visit will bring an end to my patronage of this establishment.   The problem started when we were seated. We sat in the seats in front of the Hibachi grille instead of the sides. The server came over with horns and said it was their policy for us to sit on the sides...\" just in case they got a party of four\". I asked if we could sit there and move if a party of four came in and she, very rudely, responded with no because that's their policy....which made no sense after that. Since her tone was very unfriendly and sharp, I asked to speak to the Manager. Ten seconds later, this guy comes up to us and starts going over their policy with major attitude.  At that point, my date and I look at each other amazed and decide to go somewhere else. The words that earned me \"leave my restaurant and never come back\" were: \"Managers seek to understand and not attack their customers. It's my business and the business of other faithful customers that keep the establishment going and ensure you get a paycheck. All you had to do was listen, acknowledge and apologize for the service we received.\".   So, no cursing or disrespect but pure honesty that the Manager could not take warranted this man telling me to get out and never come back. This is probably the worst service I've received in my dining history.  AGAIN, I WILL NEVER SET FOOT IN ICHIBAN EVER AGAIN AND I WILL SPREAD THE WORD OF THIS EXPERIENCE I HAD HERE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I VEHEMENTLY DETEST THIS PLACE AND WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO GIVE ANY STARS!   Now, I need to go pray. Seriously, I am THAT upset...",

We waited over an hour at the bar area with our children  in which it was very cramped with little seating.  the hostess guided us to a table and we waited there for another 20 minutes until a waiter came to take our orders. the cook came out right away after we saw the waiter and made our entire meal for us but we waited another 20 minutes to get our drinks. so we all are sitting at the table with our children eating and our waiter still did not return. took for my friend to get back up and ask for a manager for our to come back out and ask us if we needed anything. \"um yes we are eating and we didn't get our drinks\" the waiter thought it was some what funny, and silently giggled and said she will be right back with our drinks. and shortly after she returned she handed all of us our checks, so we packed up and ask for the manager to at least take off the drinks because we didn't get them until the end of our meal at the same time my son is with me while are back at the bar area and mind you he is 2 years old he accidentally breaks a wine glass that was floor level in his reach while we are discussing the bill with the rudest manager ive ever encounter. the bartender yells \"you are over there complaining you better get your child\". when i tell you the whole experience had me heated..... i was 2 seconds from going to jail. Just because everyone was very rude and had a careless attitude i think this establishment should be shut down not only because of the ppl working there but i swear i since the same shit stains on the bathroom wall since 09'.  and there are always fruit flies flying around even in the winter.",

Usually if a restaurant is busy we get ignored but not here. I'm not a heavy tipper but the service here was so good that I had to fork out the extra cash.  As for the food. You have to try it to believe it. Their sushi is very fresh. If you know anything about fresh fish you need to come visit this place and see for yourself. Their have some custom made rolls but if you are here try the Monster Roll. For appetizers we got Rock Shrimp and Kani Salad. Both were delicious. For entree we tried their Hibachi and it was amazing. Apart from the show, the chefs are very friendly and the food was on point. The sauce they give with the Hibachi is like heaven.

    "text": "BEWARE of this restaurant!  We chose to go to Ichiban in the Waterworks Plaza for dinner tonight solely because they advertised an offer on the radio for a free birthday dinner if your birthday is within 5 days (proof required). My wife and I share April 4th as a b-day and my dad's is the 6th so Hibachi it is.  I wasn't born yesterday so of course I asked for details about the deal before ordering. There's always the fine print.   Here's how it all went wrong.  1. The waitress said there is no Birthday deal. I explained where I heard it multiple times and even though she continued to deny it, I insisted on speaking to the manager.   2. She returned and said he was too busy to come over but acknowledged that she was wrong at that there is in fact a b-day special. We EACH get a b-day dinner for up to $25 with proof of a b-day within 5 days. She proceeded to check EACH of our id's. I even upped my order to the chicken and lobster for $25.95 from the original order of just chicken.  3. We enjoyed the meal and then the bill came. $25 off the total bill. NOT for each of us as the waitress described. I asked her to adjust it and she said she was wrong; it was just $25 off the total bill, not $75.  4. WHOA!!! NO! That is not how it works. When someone asks for the terms and conditions BEFORE they order and you change them AFTER the fact, that is NOT OK!  5. After spinning my wheels with the waitress I demanded to speak with the manager who now suddenly was able to make time for us. He explained that the deal was for just 1 free dinner. I explained what transpired with the waitress and he did not care. After going back and forth a few rounds I gave him an ultimatum. Either he honors the deal as the waitress described (why else would you check 3 id's?!) or we will never return as customers.  6. The manager literally said \"that's fine.\" Wow. So here we are. Posting this on Facebook, TripAdvisor, Google & Yelp asking all of you to keep it mind and share or like if you want.  7. You can choose to go here and roll the dice with them hoping they'll treat you with respect or you can go to one of the following Hibachi alternatives. Shogun is my favorite.

Comparatively speaking, this place sits right along with the other hibachi steakhouses I've been to (Nakama, Robokyo).  The chef we had this last time was friendly, and all of our meals were superb.  I'm a vegetarian, so he cooked my meal first so as not to have the utensils touch the meat stuffs.  :)  I appreciated the consideration.  Also, my son wasn't so hot on the big flame throwing.  I think he toned it down a bit, which was considerate as well.  The only complaint I have is Ichiban not having tofu on the menu.  They have vegetable hibachi, which includes tofu, but only a few, scant pieces.  That was a bit of a disappointment.  Oh, and be prepared.  You WILL be going home with leftovers.",

The chefs are really good at their jobs and offer very entertaining shows, albeit its also exactly the same as any other Hibachi place I've been to with no unique alterations. Regardless though the real highlight is the food itself. You get a soup and salad (with a fantastic dressing on it) to start, followed by the hibachi dish itself which features your choice of meat, noodles AND rice, as well as vegetables; all of which are delicious. I often go with the chicken and it is always extremely delicious. Overall for the price, this place is an amazing value and I definitely recommend going.",

When we got a table and ordered our food, I wanted double noodles and made it very clear to the waiter that I still wanted rice. When the cook came out and verified everyone's orders, he told me I ordered no rice. I had to clarify my order 3 times. I hope the chef gets most of the tip because our waiter wasn't that great. Didn't even box our food like the other servers do or ask us for a refill on our drinks.",

I then ordered steak and scallop hibachi - which also came with shrimp - and loved it. The salad that comes with it is pretty basic but the flavored broth that comes with it is super delicious. All of the meats that they serve with the hibachi appeared to be of very high quality - the noodles could be a bit more flavorful but the fried rice is good and I also like the vegetables - the broccoli, mushrooms and carrots - that come with it as well.   The customer service was quick and attentive despite us having such a large group and the atmosphere was clean and professional. I imagine high safety standards are followed by the feel of it - something important in a suchi place.",

Come on Adam!  This used to be such a nice and clean place.  What happened??  The whole upscale vibe is gone and now it's become trashy.   The hibachi chefs don't even try to interact with the guests.  Most of them can't even make a proper onion volcano let alone put on a show.   I'm probably going to go to Saga in cranberry from now on.",

It doesn't even matter how the food was (which was good- not great, not bad, just good) because I wouldn't consider going again after the experience last night. She was irritated when we asked questions about the sushi, then when she brought the wrong roll (the specific one we asked for) her response was \" well I didn't understand your question).\" Okay, so then why didn't you clarify that? She returned the food and brought out what we ordered by slamming it on the table and walking away- and we didn't see her again for the rest of the night. No refills on our drinks, no checking in to see how our food was, nothing. We had to ask for our check from another waiter passing by. Absolutely terrible, will never return.",
