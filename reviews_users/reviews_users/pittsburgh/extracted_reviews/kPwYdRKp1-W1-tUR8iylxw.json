I drove by another location last week on McKnight Road, and it was like the clouds parted and bright white light shined upon the shopping center.  Shined enough that I decided to put this location into Yelp; it wasn't already here.  This place was *packed*, with a line, and we were still seated, fed, and out the door in 45 minutes.  The food was outstanding in every way, the variety was just shy of overwhelming, and did I mention the service was lightning fast?  Everyone in town should try eating here at least once.",

Never had the desserts but the pastry and giant cakes look over the top! Sorry if this review is a little underwhelming, but when I went here the first time I was very excited but I was turned off by the smarmy wait staff who seemed uppity and snooty. I thought the service could have been better, I was not offered water. The food at times can be overspiced. To me, a little cumin goes a long way. The hummus was good, for starters. The falafel sandwich was greasy. The iced tea I ordered was good. This location is right next to Starbucks on McKnight rd.",

Had the lamb wrap. Good as always. Juicy and perfectly cooked.  Had the hummus and pita for an app. Good too. Only complaints are, as always, the foil wrapped wraps are a little tacky and fast foody. I've never liked that about this place. Also, the service was a little off. The hummus app was brought out, but it was just the hummus; no pita. That did come eventually without asking but still, it's like ordering vegetable soup and bringing out the vegetables and then a few minutes later, the broth. Then the server didn't come back for a very long time to take our food order so we ate the hummus and pita with our menus in the way for while. Then after our order was taken it took a while for the food to come out. Everything else the rest of the time went fine. Maybe just an off day.",

I sometimes order some Diwali if I'm nearby and starving, because I can eat those while driving and they're wicked delicious little green tubes of love! One time I had A lamb rolled pita and some bits of the meat were a little chewy, but the flavor was awesomesauce...so I just chewed a little longer, no worries. Due to schedule conflicts within my house, we can rarely go out for a meal, so we order take-out from here at least once a month, they pack everything up really nice and have never forgotten anything. They always ask if we need plastic cutlery too. The only dessert I've had is the fruit and yogurt salad because I'm a celiac, I LOVE that salad (dessert, to me!) drizzled with honey and a sprinkle of walnuts, so yummy!  Before I knew I was celiac my favorite dish was the Fatayer Plate, I miss being able to enjoy that!!  I ALWAYS order the large Hummus so my son and I don't fight over it! He eats it with pita, I eat it with veggies I cut up at home. When I have dined there, the service has been really good. TRY IT!!",

The staff has always been very friendly and helpful here and they come by very often (I guess since it is such a small place!) and check on you.  While most of the food is delicious and spiced just right, for some reason their hummus is a little bland. You can fix this easily though by asking for the hot sauce, and mixing some of it with the hummus. But I like things a bit spicy sometimes. Other than that, the rest is all great.  I recommend it to everyone. If you are new, I would suggest tying the appetizer sampler and trying it all, and also order one of the pita pizzas (falafel pizza is one of my favorites).

    "text": "Aladdin's is a chain I first discovered in Columbus, Ohio. The food is pretty good, on the whole, and the reasonable prices make it a nice fresh alternative to, say, Eat n' Park. The portions are pretty huge and I always leave with leftovers unless all I get is a rolled pita.   They really hawk the health aspects of their food on the menu, which gives me a giggle since I don't think I've ever gone there without tacking a huge piece of cake on to the end of the meal. It is True that the appetizers and entrees are made with fresh ingredients, plenty of veggies, and olive oil -- so the cake doesn't make it entirely a lie.  So what's good here? Everything I've ever tried is at least reasonably tasty, but some items stand out. The almond dressing, first and foremost, makes anything better. I could drink it if it weren't completely unreasonable to do so.  Aladdin's hummus is great. It's a thin, smooth version, topped with olive oil, kalamata olives (just one or two) and cucumber. It's heavy on the tahini, which gives a faint bitter taste that contrasts nicely with the sweetness of the flour in the pita. If you don't like that, you can always try adding a little salt, which also counteracts bitterness.  Speaking of the pita, it's a little hit-or-miss here. I've sometimes gotten baskets of dry, stale pita and sometimes nice warm fresh pita. If you luck into the latter, it's nice and chewy. If the former... well, send it back and ask for fresh instead.  The mujadara is good, but not as deliciously filled with caramelized onion flavor as when I make it at home. Best eaten in the salad pocket pita, then, to add contrast in taste and texture.  One of my favorites is the shawarma hummus plate, which boasts all the above hummus features plus pine nuts and pretty tasty grilled beef strips. It's enormous, though, so plan having it for two meals if you are of average appetite.  My standby, though, is the tuna shawarma rolled (pita). It takes them about 15 minutes to make this; a bit of a wait, but worth it for fresh-grilled tuna. Now, we're still in landlocked Pittsburgh at a casual restaurant, so it's not going to be the best tuna you've ever eaten. It's almost invariably slightly overcooked, but the tahini yogurt dressing remoistens everything. And the pickled turnips lend crunch and tartness.  As for the smoothies, I've only ever had the fresh fruit one, which is mixed up with strawberries, bananas and orange juice. It mostly tastes like strawberries and bananas, and does have some bits of apple or grape skin lingering about, but it's pretty good and almost the same price as a Coke.  And then there are the desserts. If you elect to have dessert, they walk you over to the case to give you a guided tour. I kind of hate that, since I feel like I'm awkwardly blocking the entrance/exit and can't remember the top of the case by the time they reach the bottom. But hey, OK, that's how they roll.  The cake is good. I've been a pastry chef and worked in a bakery, and the cake itself is well-executed. It's light and has a good crumb going on, and since they keep it refrigerated you get a smooth, cool texture that isn't overly sweet by itself. Their mousses are decent, and the ganache is reasonably good, too. Put them all together and you have something rather tasty. I like the peanut butter and chocolate variants they often have, as well as the espresso. Best cake ever? No, but it's better than most.  I've never tried the cheesecake, but want to. Today they had a baklava-topped cheesecake which sounded amazing but also kind of ridiculous. We decided to save it for another visit.  Service is friendly and prompt at this location. The interior is pretty laid back; nothing to write home about, but it's clean and not distracting. With plenty of vegetarian options and health-conscious ingredients (NB: you still have to watch the calories, if you're watching them, since the portions are so large), it's a good place to visit if you need to accommodate varying dietary preferences. Maybe not so much with the low-carb, but who still does that, anyway?",

    "text": "This review is specifically for the Aladdin's on McKnight Rd.   One day I ordered all this stuff. I was really pumped to get it and I live far away from the place. Of course they're not going to deliver it so I drive all the way out there. Again, in my excitement I pick up the stuff and put it in my car. I'm trying to hurry home and it eat it, mainly because I'm excited. And the person I'm with is excited too. We both were - because we know how good Aladdin's can be.   And then we got home.  And there was like one piece of meat all crumpled up like someone stuffed it in there without a second thought. C'mon man. I'm not a 75 lb. child. I need something larger than the size of one golf ball. And what about our other food? It was dry like sand and not worth eating. NOT THE STUFF I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO.  In the end, my excitement was all for naught. I wasted all that time driving to this place that prides itself on being called an eatery. Pick up a Pez dispenser or some tic-tacs, you'll get more of a meal out of them than a beef kabibby from this joint.",

My Mom and I stumbled-across Aladdin's Eatery while out shopping and my taste buds are still celebrating. I had the Vegetarian Sampler Appetizer as my main course: no I didn't eat the whole thing, which had Tabbouleh, Hummus, BabaG(sp?), Grape Leaves and Falafel (and of course Pita).  I ate half and as my appetite slowed, I was sad to think that it was almost over: thank God for leftovers!",

So glad we did the pita pizza was excellent. They slice it into 4 slices which made an excellent starter into our new food journey. I had Alladdins favorite plate. Very good well seasoned good serving size. My wife had the lamb and judging by her empty plate it must have been good. My daughter had shanshawma (steak). Also very good. Almost all the entrees are under $14 and tons if salads and wraps to try. Overall  from one former Applebee's diner to all the others out there don't be afraid to try something new",

The dishes are much lower in quality, cleanliness, and flavor compared to the Cranberry and Squirrel Hill locations. My partner and I have visited and had take out from this location many times and have been consistently disappointed. Disappointments include, burned greasy bits stuck to the bottom of out peta roles, waiters forgetting to get us pitas on more than two occasions, missing ingredients in dishes, and complete lack of flavor. I think the biggest disappointment is that we know how good it can be and get our hopes up each time. \"Maybe this time it won't be half bad\" We have yet to be impressed or even satisfied. Quotes from my partner about this location: \"Smells better than it tastes\" \"It's better than not eating anything, but not by much\"",

It tasted fresh and was a generous serving for the price...around $6. The serving was equivalent to the size of a container of hummus you'd buy at the grocery store. It was garnished with a little olive oil, seasoning, and a slice of tomato and cucumber.   When I was ordering my hummus I couldn't help but notice the display case full of cakes. There was an apple pie cheesecake that looked like it would have been heaven, but I was trying to be a good girl and resisted the urge to order a slice. It wasn't an easy feat!  It was a great first encounter with Aladdin's. I'll definitely be back! Next time I think I want to try one of their rolled pitas or pita pitzas.",

    "text": "I always forget about Aladdin's and I don't know why because, each and every time I eat at one, it's just so dang yummy! My bf is not from Pittsburgh and was visiting this weekend and our major destination was the new Trader Joe's in the North hills (review ill come later). It was about 2:00pm Sunday and we hadn't eaten yet and were famished. After racking my brain for good options in the North Hills, I remembered Aladdin's, so off we went! When we arrived there were 2 or 3 other tables in the restaurant and we were quickly sat and greeted by our server. We each got a water and I also ordered a \"constant comment\" hot tea. Our server brought those quickly and since their menu is HUGE (although I always end up ordering the same thing), we still needed some more time to look everything over. Our patient server came back within a few minutes and I ordered my usual the chicken shawarma rolled (Marinated char-grilled chicken with tomato and onion topped with Tahini Yogurt dressing, rolled in a pita) and my bf ordered the Arayiss Pitza ( Hummus serves as a base and it's topped with seasoned ground meat, diced tomato, pine nuts and garnished with chopped parsley). I'm always amazed by the size of the chicken shawarma-it's huge and leaves you feeling full but not overly stuffed. And it's relatively healthy to boot! I gave a piece to the bf and he agreed that it is awesomely delicious! He really enjoyed his pitza-basically it's a flat pita personal pizza- and also noted that he was full but not overly stuffed after consuming the entire dish. I tried a bite-mostly because I've always wanted to try their pitzas but habitually order the same chicken shawarma regardless-and it was very tasty! I really liked the addition of the pine nuts for that added crunch. Best of all, this delicious meal came to $17.50 for the both of us! Yummy food at a great price point....we will be back!",

It's also very healthy, and fresh, so you don't have to feel bad about eating here. They are one of the few places that offers organic wine, which is awesome- delicious and no headache after consuming. Not to mention the deserts! I am usually pretty full after the meal, but I always take a piece of cake home.",

We decided to   give the restaurant a try again tonight and I'm actually angry upon leaving.  -We were seated and waited over 15 mins to be acknowledged.  We placed our order.  I got the chicken chili to start and the Jasmine beef shawarma.   -We waited for a half hour, watched people sat after us get their drinks and entrees, no sign of her.   -She brought everything including my chili out at once and disappeared again.   -She brought me the wrong order - a beef shawarma roll but she never came back so I ate my chili in hopes I'd see her again by the time I was done with my chili.   -I ate my chili, my husband finished his entree.  We never saw her.  No refills, nada.   -She asked if we wanted the check and we explained that I was given the wrong dish.  It was uneaten.  She seemed confused.... Said she'd talk to the manager.    -She came back and said the manager told her they'd have to charge me half of the Jasmine beef shawarma price.  She actually thought this was acceptable.    -So instead of having the $14 beef shawarma I didn't receive get taken off the bill,  they charged me $7.  The roll I was given incorrectly and DIDN'T eat only cost $6.25!  -I was charged $7 for something I didn't eat or receive.  I was charged for having a bad experience by the manager.   I will not be back, not even for take out.    Worst customer experience I've ever had.",

I passed the Aladdin's driving home from Wexford and decided to stop for an early lunch on Saturday at around 11:30 AM.  The place was not yet very busy but was packed by the time I left around 45 minutes later.  I asked my server what she would recommend and she suggested the lamb plate with the garlic sauce and hot sauce.  It was absolutely fabulous.  It was the perfect lunch (brunch) for a chilly day.  The desserts all looked divine, but I opted to forgo dessert but did have coffee which was delicious.  I plan to go to Aladdin's more often but plan to go on \"off\" times to avoid the crowds.  Highly recommend!",

She couldn't give recommendations, didn't bring sweetener for our tea or refill the pita until we asked 3 times. Food was meh. We love trying new places and two of us are vegetarians. Was expecting a lot from the reviews. Order baklava as a birthday treat. It was dried out, not warmed, with wrapping on it. Left it largely uneaten. Never did check on how we liked it, even though most of our food was not eaten. Never got refills.   Service abysmal for a party of five. I was a server in college and give people breaks, but she was terrible. Someone else ran our food and just walked away.   Waste of my birthday dinner & wasn't cheap. We all agreed we will never go back. I'm not willing to risk that maybe it was just an off night because others who came in after got their food before us and saw them get refills.",

I love that they are sensitive to food restrictions and clearly label things to that end on their menu. I love that they have healthier options if you want to go out to eat but not kill your waistline.   But unfortunately, the thing I need to love the most about Aladdin's -- the actual food -- was just not all that impressive during my visit. I ordered the Jasmine Favorite dinner with chicken. The medley of beans, veggies, and rice that sounded tantalizing from the menu description was bland and devoid of the promised seasoning. The bits of veggies looked and tasted as though they came straight from a freezer bag. And the chicken tawook adorning the top of the dish was tough, flavorless, and had an oily coating of what tasted like Sysco-type industrial cooking spray. The dish just didn't taste all that fresh (or all that Mediterranean, frankly).   They have a huge menu, so perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing or went on an off night. I do like the concept, so I may go back again and try something else. But for now, I can't give my very average meal any more than 3 very average stars.",

    "text": "After eyeing this place for a while, I decided to stop in for take out. I got beef shawarma plate with hummus. It came with bread. The whole ride home, it smelled so good that I wanted to pull over and have a taste (ok I was also starving).  The hummus and beef was excellent - i wish there was more meat as it was delicious. The people who took my order were the nicest and friendliest that I have met for a while! I would go back just to be surrounded by these kind people and amazing food!",

    "text": "Aladdin's is an amazing local restaurant chain, and I was excited to finally introduce the restaurant to my husband! We've been here twice recently, and unfortunately, I must admit that our experiences were pretty different.  Food: Aladdin's food is excellent, particularly for the price. Getting an appetizer is a must, and I usually order the hummus. I'm not a hot sauce fan, but trust me, order some of their hot sauce and add a bit (to taste) to the hummus. It will blow your mind! I've also had the tabouli here before and would highly recommend it, too. In addition to the appetizers, I have enjoyed the rolled pitas (particularly the Aladdin's kabob and the chicken shawarma). The rolled pitas come packed full of meat and veggies, and I believe are a great value for the price. I also tried Farrouk's falafel pitza and was a bit disappointed. I didn't love the flavors or the thin, toasted pita crust and wish I had ordered one of the rolled pitas instead.  Service: The first time that my husband and I came here, service was phenomenal. Our food was delivered promptly, and our female waitress (not sure of her name, but she has a very sweet, high voice) was amazing! However, the second time we've been here, we were very disappointed in our service. It was extremely slow and seemed to be because of our male college-student aged waiter. The table next to us arrived and ordered after we did but finished eating when we had just received our food. Our waiter was MIA for long periods of time during our meal, including not refilling drinks promptly and taking a very long time to deliver our tabouli appetizer (which I can't imagine took the kitchen more than 3 minutes to make and plate).  Overall, Aladdin's is a great restaurant. However, I am definitely going to pause before coming here again to make sure that I have plenty of time available for a meal that could potentially take a very long time to be served...",

    "text": "My favorite thing about this place is that they're open til 9 on Sundays. It's nice to not have to get fast food after work in the evening. The service is always quick & I've never had to ask for refills on anything. Their cakes are SOOO good. My favorite thing to order is the falafel hummus wrap. It's simple, filling & only $7. My boyfriend always gets the lamb platter & it costs $14 so it's pretty reasonably priced all around.",

The hummus is a MUST and get it with their hot sauce. That sounds weird but trust me on this..... best combo to hit the 412. Anyways my gf and I decided to share the lamb platter and it was cooked to absolute perfection. Also I got the tabbouli salad which was so perfect, i love the amount of lemon/lime juice. Makes for a great complement to any meal there.",

Today I ordered takeout and remembered after making the call that one of my guests is deathly allergic to tree nuts. I asked if that would be a problem and the hostess went out of her way to ensure that the kitchen had changed their gloves and that the pita bread bag had been unopened to avoid cross contamination. It was just one of many fantastic experiences.",
