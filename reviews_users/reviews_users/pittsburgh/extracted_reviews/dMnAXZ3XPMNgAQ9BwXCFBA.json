The hostess greeted us upon arrival, and told us to sit wherever we'd like... after which we sat at a table and were ignored. Very disappointed. The hostess delivered water to the table next to us, was chatty with others, but did not acknowledge us at all after we sat down. Not a good way for a new spot to build a positive reputation. Living nearby, we wanted to support a local business, but just can't abide with such bad (non-existent) service.",

    "text": "My husband and I went with his parents last night, and we had an absolutely excellent dinner.  My mother-in-law heard a while back that they had haluski, and she really wanted to try it.  Knowing that spring produce would be on its way in, I figured we were running out of chances.  When I called for reservations, I was told I was speaking with the owner, Don, who is basically the nicest guy ever.  I asked if they had haluski, and he told me that it was no longer on the menu.  I figured the menu might change often, but I knew my mother-in-law would be so sad that she'd missed it.  After chatting, he said, \"Let me talk to my chef and I'll call you back.\"  He calls me back and says, \"Your mother-in-law will eat haluski on Friday night.  Come on in.\"  They made her a beautiful plate of gnocchi and braised cabbage, which she loved, and she felt very special and taken care of. Just such a lovely gesture, but that is not the sole reason for my 5 stars.  Our whole dinner was amazing.  First, they have great cocktails, and our entire table was happy with them.  I had a sparkling daiquiri and a sazerac, and I loved both.....that sazerac was seriously awesome.  We shared the hummus and the brussels sprouts.  The hummus was smoky, smooth and delicious, and it was served with a very generous portion of really great grilled bread.  The brussels sprouts were a huge hit, served with slivers of pears, nuts, goat cheese and a cider reduction.  My father-in-law (not a lover of brussels sprouts.  at all.)  kept saying, \"I've just never tasted anything like this.  These are delicious.  I've just never had anything like this before.\"  Very generous portion, and definitely enough for the four of us to share.  I had gnocchi and escargot, and the garlic breath I'll have for days is well worth it.  The gnocchi were not gummy in the least; they were light and wonderful.  The herbal green sauce was bright and pungent, and it was perfect with the escargot; I loved my entree.  My husband and father-in-law both got hanger steak, and it was so tender and cooked perfectly.  They shared fries.  Go there and order fries.  I swear they were the best fries; they were like pillows of potatoes.  We were so full, but my mother-in-law (who was wise enough to eat half of her plate of haluski and have the rest packed up) wanted dessert, so we shared the panna cotta, which was, again, enough for the four of us to share.  It was perfect, and it was topped with pistachio crumble and blood oranges.  The wait staff is lovely, and they clearly work well together.  The restaurant is beautiful and has a great atmosphere.  There are some really unique touches in the decor.  My father-in-law remarked on the way home that he appreciated that it wasn't too loud.  We will be back soon and we will be telling our friends.  If you don't often venture to Troy Hill, start now.",

I have no relation to scratch whatsoever, with that being said \"beef cheeks\" and \"beef tongue\" is exactly what Troy hill needs. And comfort food is exactly what Scratch does. Comfort food with a refined twist easing people in to a finer experience with things like a classic Ruben with a progressive twist. Also it's all made from scratch, even the ketchup! It's hard for some yinzers to understand that real homemade ketchup does not taste like Heinz. Great decor keeping the classic look of an old beautiful space, great service, and can not wait to go back and see what els is exciting on their ever changing menu. Scratch is a must visit and a great new addition to Troy Hill!",

The menu is limited and I went with the pancakes made with Rivertown pineapple beer. I was pretty disappointed as you only got 2 pancakes for $9. Also the pancakes were globed with way too much cranberry sauce that was over powering. I unfortunately left still hungry. Others in my party got the chicken and biscuits which they were then out of and a very small portion. The also had poutine which was a hearty portion and a favorite at our table. The service was great, I just which the portions were bigger for the price.",

I had cocktails that were well made and the staff was quite friendly. I felt like the space the bands took up was a little much for how small the bar area is, but most people didn't seem to mind.   The second time I went was last night. A friend and I went just for dinner and sat at the bar.  They had a duet playing and I felt like it was a lot nicer than the bigger bands they had the first time I was there.   For dinner I had the vegetarian tacos but requested they be placed on lettuce instead of in taco shells. They made me the most perfect lettuce shells and the tacos were declicious. Lots of flavor and the perfect texture for the tofu.  We also split the Brussels sprouts and the summer squash + eggplant. First, the squash dish was very fresh and herby, but it wasn't a total party in my mouth. I felt like it was missing something. HOWEVER...the Brussels sprouts caused a hella mouthgasm to occur. They are deep fried sprouts with a balsamic drizzle and some ricotta cheese. I couldn't stop eating them, and I actually haven't stopped thinking about them since. I need them again. And if you're reading this review, you need them also.",

    "text": "When I moved back to PGH from LA, I lived 1/2 a block from Billy's. It was a local bar with casual (and good!) dining.   Fast forward 14 years, and I know own a house on top of Troy Hill ... just up the street from Scratch. (If anyone ever tells you life doesn't come full circle, they're a liar!)   While I love local dive bars, some of the old-school places on Troy Hill can be a little scary (and I'm a tough girl). I mean no offense to my neighborhood, but really .... they are. When I have 10 friends that want to do a bar crawl, I'll go into some of them. Until then, I'll hit up Scratch, Tammy's and the Troy Hill Inn.     So, when Scratch opened, it was a breath of fresh air.  If you've read my other posts, I'm not into trendy, pretentious establishments. I like a blue collar-feeling places that serves high-quality food and drink.  While the decor and menu are a hip and trendy, the vibe is down-to-earth and people are friendly ... it still feels like the Pittsburgh I love.  Definitely try the poutine and, when you're free on a Sunday, stop for brunch. If you're into a shot and a beer, you can get a Jameson and Miller Lite for $5.50. There's always a great selection of crafts on tap, many of which are regional brews.  The prices are completely reasonable and much less in comparison with other city neighborhoods.   The sometimes have live music on Thursday night -- I think it's the third, maybe last, Thursday of the month. We've also stopped in for the Tuesday trivia. We're both smart people and feel like idiots ... it's hard! But, if you're up on your pop culture knowledge, it may be up your alley. It wasn't for us :)   My only complaint ... the bartenders aren't always attentive. I've been in when it's not that busy (5-6 people at the bar) and rather than engaging with patrons, they're chit chatting themselves. I'm cool with that ... if my beer isn't sitting empty on the bar.",

The bar/lounge area is casual and homey with a mix of sofas and chairs along with normal bar seating.   Two things that impressed me immediately with Scratch's service was they were able to transfer the bar tab to the table, and they had tables assigned for reservations rather than overbooking and scrambling for a table. These two characteristics are becoming less common in the age of Millennial dining and it's great to see Scratch is aiming higher.   There was a wide selection of unique cocktails. In chatting with the bartender most of their spirits are sourced from smaller boutique distilleries. As a Grey Goose loyalist, he suggested a different Pennsylvania disliked vodka which was like nothing I had ever tasted.  The food could be best described as comfort food tapas. For the group of three we ordered 7 dishes which was adequate for the table. The three favorites were the brussel sprouts, chicken biscuits and fried risotto. While the group are a more intellectual healthy bunch, all had a unique presentation, flavorful seasoning and excellent texture that modernizes your grandmothers favorite recipe!  The only critique I could find was the fact they had no deserts available. Even though we were one of the first groups in, the very friendly server stated they had run out. Other than this minor detail, I'd say the food and mixed cocktails were like none other I've had. I'd place Scratch on a short list of restaurants that set a higher bar. For a split second I thought I was in New York or San Francisco... Until I walked out the door.",

Honestly I would have to say that for me they were the best fries that I've ever eaten in the city in my 25 years here. Huge portion and very good.

The food was good but wasn't great or what we were expecting and much more expensive than we were anticipating. My husband and I had the salmon croquette which was ok, a little on the dry side. My friends are both vegetarians and had pretty limited choices, which is a change from the old menu as well. Anyway, it is still a great little spot in Troy Hill I just don't think we'll be heading back with the new menu and prices as we have other restaurants we'd rather spend that kind of money at.

Despite the great renovations made to an old building, the service was lacking and the food was mediocre.   We tried Scratch on the Tuesday prior to Christmas around 8 pm and they were jumping. What the owners have done with this place is incredible! I've been to the old Billy's Bistro and always thought that with some TLC it had a lot of potential. The owners of Scratch saw that potential and capitalized on it. It's modern, but rustic, very casual, but it still feels like you're having a cool night out. The building is split into a bar side (the bar and about 6 2-4 tops), and a dining room side, we sat in the bar side. The bar side is very loud, and could really use something to help dampen the noise.   The service was slow and gave off the air of being inconvenienced. Due to a food allergy we asked if anything on the menu was, or could be made, gluten free. The server went back to the kitchen to ask, then returned to tell us that most things on the menu are vegan. We re-stated that we were looking for gluten free options, and after another trip to the kitchen the server said \"IDK, just get a burger without a bun.\" If you don't offer anything gluten free that is completely fine, but it would have been helpful if the server could have guided us through the menu with a little less attitude.   We ordered the Brussels sprouts (delicious), their house burger with out the bun, and their Reuben. The burger patty was decent but overcooked, and the fries were heavily seasoned with black pepper and their house spice. The ketchup that accompanied the fries was more akin to tomato sauce than ketchup, but we appreciate the scratch made effort. The Reuben was tasty, but by the time it go to me the bottom slice of bread was completely sogged out, and I couldn't even pick it up to eat it.   Overall it took us about an hour and half for an appetizer and 2 sandwiches.   I'll try Scratch again, I really want to like this place, hopefully the food and service improve.",

The mushroom gravy was rich and luxurious and the cheese curds were fresh and plentiful. Amazing dish which paired nicely with a local Belgium beer from Draai Laag.",

    "text": "Since it's replacing Troy Hill's flagship restaurant, Billy's, Scratch's opening has been highly anticipated. We went tonight during their opening weekend, and the suspense was worth it.  The drink menu includes fairly-priced craft beers and creative handcrafted cocktails, along with the standard Miller, Yuengling, etc. and classics like an old fashioned. The Bertha, with lemon shrub, gin, and muddled cucumber and mint, was delicious.  The food menu features creative takes on familiar recipes and ingredients, with much-appreciated vegetarian and gluten-free options. The Brussels sprout appetizer was amazing. Seriously, just order it. I also had the Vegetable Pot, an updated veggie pot pie, which was perfect comfort food that still felt healthy. The thin, crispy crust was poured over the top and well seasoned with herbs and cheese. Because there was no pie crust on the bottom or sides, it wasn't too heavy. The filling was a blend of potatoes,  carrots and peas in a creamy vegetarian gravy.   The renovation is gorgeous, with lots of exposed wood, windows and open space. The atmosphere preserves the comfort of Billy's, but with a vibe you'd expect more from Lawrenceville than Troy Hill. Live terrariums on every table, well-spaced seating, and fun touches like board games, an area with couches, a jukebox, and pinball make it feel inviting. All of the staff were super friendly, too, and checked in to chat and ask for feedback.   I'm so glad to see this place in Troy Hill. It's great to have somewhere in the neighborhood that's casual and affordable enough for happy hour and hip enough to bring friends for a fancier date.",

    "text": "We came here specifically because the online menu had so many vegetarian options.  Their menu was totally different from OpenTable and even their own website, which was disappointing because the vegetarian options were what was missing.  That being said, we decided to stay and try it out because I eat meat and there were some vegetarian small plates for my boyfriend.  Everything that came next is best framed from the idea that we were not happy within the first 2 minutes because of the unexpected lack of menu diversity.   My boyfriend said his drink was very good. My wine was a standard deloach Pinot noir but tasted like the bottle sat open for days. It also was a very small pour for $13 which would lead me to believe it was the last of the bottle.   My boyfriend ordered the zucchini. None of the menu items have much description about how the items are actually prepared. We asked about the zucchini and it was not well explained by the server. It was...very different. A cold marinated zucchini dish that did not work.  My boyfriend is a chef and is usually pretty tolerant of things that reimagine common agreements, but this was not good.   The ricotta with the focaccia and the olives were very good.   I made the mistake of ordering the hot chicken as an entree. It tasted off from the first bite. Either like old meat or meat that was cooked and held. It was similar to chicken you'd expect to get in Chinese takeout. I was told it was confited then breaded and fried, which it clearly was, but there's no mistaking the flavor of meat that is \"off.\"  Our server was good aside from not describing the zucchini dish very well.  She was very nice.  The menu just was very disappointing and the things we ordered that they actually cooked were bad.  I heard great things about the restaurant previously but I don't know what changed as far as the menu or the kitchen to explain our experience tonight.",

Gone were the 2 levels of tables ... new hardwood floors modern decor.  Then it went down hill quick.  The alcohol options were a 2 sided 8.5\" x 11\" piece of paper.  The menu had 10 items ... 7 were vegetarian.  I was dining with a carnivore.  They don't serve ice tea. No steak option.  One chicken option.  We had cheeseburgers that were ok.  The homemade pickles were interesting.  Troy Hill residents are blue collar people who would walk to the restaurant.  The owners kept a waitress and cook from Billy's... I suggest you ask them what kept the seats filled with return customers.  If your goal is yuppie bar,  at least serve yuppie bar food.  If your goal is a restaurant change the menu.  One reviewer said closed by 4th of July.  I agree.",

    "text": "We had a reservation at Scratch to celebrate Father's Day and my husband's promotion. The GM Don was very friendly and accommodating - even making sure that our server knew about the special occasions. All of us huge fans of small plates, we were ready to eat!  We started by ordering...nearly the entire left side of the 'Smaller Plates' section.   -- The ricotta spread (thyme, black pepper, focaccia) was so delicious, we ordered it twice.  -- The corn zeppole and dipping sauce (jalepeno, lime, crema) was a savory take on one of my favorite sweet treats.  -- The asparagus (pistachio, soft boiled egg, horseradish) paired nicely with the crab arancini (old bay, scallion, lemon).  -- The zucchini (goat cheese, almond, red onions, herbs) was just as great as the ricotta.  -- My most favorite dish was the lamb sausage (basmati, deep-fried chickpeas, lemon, pomegranate, mint), which we also ordered a second round of because we devoured it.  -- The artichoke (Caesar, parsley, chilies) was my least favorite - but that might have been because we ate it last and I was starting to get full!   Although we drooled every time a server walked by with the hot fried chicken (cayenne, pickles, buttermilk, brioche), pork belly (crushed potato, egg, Aleppo honey), and hanger steak (broccolini, sunchoke, chimichurri, paprika - a patron and staff favorite), we moved on to desserts - both of them!  -- The vanilla (cream, almond, citrus) was a cool custard dish that played a great opposite to the other desert. -- The chocolate (chocolate ganache, fluff, graham) was my favorite, with a gelatin-type consistency to the ganache, marshmallow fluff, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch-esque graham crumble.   In addition to the voluminous feast: my husband enjoyed the curated beer selection; my father, who isn't normally that adventurous when it comes to drinks, enjoyed a craft cocktail - the \"Kali\" (lavender earl grey infused Faber vodka, lemon, Wigle rosemary lavender bitters, Zardetto); and, my mom and I enjoyed many, many glasses of Zardetto private cuvee, which is ON DRAFT.  A few notes on things I think could improve: Drink orders came out pretty slow. Order timing was fairly nonexistent. At most small plates places I've loved, servers understood cook times and adjusted accordingly to not overwhelm the diner. In this case, almost all of our food came out at the same time. I would have like a slower procession and a bit more time in between dishes so we could enjoy eating. Also, until we said something, there was no A/C on a pretty warm day, which made the room a bit uncomfortable - especially since we at so much!  Overall, the food at Scratch is absolutely worth your time and money. The drink options only improve the experience. And the restaurant is impeccably decorated, with a beautiful blue color on the walls and unique art pieces everywhere. I highly recommend Scratch for your next special occasion - or for no occasion at all!",

I started with the riccotta appetizer. It was very light, flavorful and fresh.  It certainly did not fill me up. For my entree I had the lamb sausage over basmati rice. The roasted chickpeas added a great texture to the dish.  The only constructive criticism/request that I would put into the chef is to please always maintain at least 1 to 2 appetizers with a protein.    While there are a ton of great options now in Lawrenceville, Shadyside, downtown, etc...I'd highly recommend taking your sweetheart up to mount Troy and visit this lovely establishment.",

    "text": "I have to look at some of the reviews and scratch my head - me and my wife live nearby in the North Side and had heard great things from our neighbors since they opened.   We stopped in on a Friday evening after work and sat down right away. Our server was awesome - really friendly, and helpful with any questions we had.   For drinks me and my wife ordered the Bertha, which was a slam dunk...make sure you try it. To eat my wife ordered the Halusky and I went with the low country Stroganoff, one of my favorite comfort foods. Now I'm polish, and this Halusky was a creative take on the dish...a bit different than our family recipe but still delicious. The stroganoff was served over cheesy & buttery grits instead of noodles that I'm used to, but it still rocked my world. I almost licked the plate because the grits were so good, and I typically don't even like them that much. I hope they decide to start serving them as a side or by themselves!   We were both pretty hungry so we decided to try an order of the Mac and cheese with hot sauce, and we cleaned that up as well. They must have thought we had never eaten before   When we were finished Don, their owner, stopped by our table and talked with us for a bit - really nice guy and clearly interested making sure this place succeeds.   Don't let the iffy reviews throw you off, this place rocks. If you want something vegan or a huge menu, you can find that nearby in Lawrenceville.   If you want some delicious comfort food that soothes the soul, come here - its what they're good at.",

    "text": "I have been here three times now and was surprised by the menu on my latest visit.  Other visits had very reasonably priced comfort food options.  Not anymore.  I keep seeing recent reviews with poutine, which was no where to be found on the latest menu.   That doesn't mean the food is bad, but just not what I expected and it was much pricier for a meal than before.  The quality of the porchetta was high, but it just didn't taste that great.  Especially with honey on it.  That is just a personal preference and I guess part of it was just my disappointment at the new menu.  It seemed extra fancy and that is not the type of person that I am.  My friend got the octopus.  The portion wasn't huge (he paid double for the dinner sized portion) and he complained that it had a ton of cilantro, which he isn't a fan of.   I also HATE the small two seat tables.  They are way too long and it felt like I was really far away from my friend when we were talking.  That has been a problem since they opened.   I am still giving the place 4 stars because I think the quality of the food is high and people who like a fancier dish should check it out. I am probably not going to be back, unless they go back to something like the older menu, but I think others with different palates should give it a try.",

    "text": "First review! Decided to write because I was so impressed with this little hidden gem in Troy Hill.   Beautiful and super quaint decor inside, sat on the dining room side. Went in for an early dinner- I recommend reservations, we didn't have them but they were able to get us seated.  Our waitress was SUPER helpful. We had looked online, (please update your website! We came for halusky and crickets, neither was on the menu!) Since we had kind of picked out what we were eating we had no idea what to get at that point. But our waitress knew exactly what to recommend, and answered all of our questions. We didn't plan on getting a big dinner but we couldn't help ourselves at that point, she made everything sound SO good. (You can really tell when someone takes pride in their job, and she was definitely proud of the food they had to offer - we were also a little taken aback at the small size of the menu, but she explained they value quality and with the small size of the kitchen they are able to make some really delicious food.)  My husband ordered the chicken liver pate and I had the soup of the day for starters. Both very tasty! I got the porchetta as my entree and my husband got the steak frites. The porchetta was delicious and like no dish I'd ever had before. The waitress told us it's a traditional Italian dish, and they cook it for 36 hours. My husband loved his steak, it was a perfect medium rare and the fries are house cut.   The drink menu was also very good! We had ordered a prosecco on draft and a cocktail called a Sexy Vamp. The cocktail was so good my husband had to get one for himself, I wouldn't share. Also very impressive was that the waitress told us that all of the signature cocktails are made with Pennsylvanian liquors and all beers are from within 300 miles.   Really, with the great food and amazing service we will recommend this to our friends and definitely be back. Just don't look to the website for menu info!",

    "text": "Upon moving to Troy Hill a few months ago, we have been anxiously awaiting trying Scratch. Troy Hill is about to boom and Scratch is just the beginning.  I am very conflicted on how I feel about my experience. There are so many things right and so many things wrong. Let's start with the ambience... Very good! Love the rustic look they're going for. It almost reminded me of a more modern ski resort. There's so much space as well! You have your main room with the bar and dining tables, then two separate dining areas.   On to the food-- I ordered a burger and loved it. Very tasty and the fries were awesome. They use a very unique seasoning that is making my mouth water as we speak. Their ketchup is also homemade apparently. Nothing better than fries with ketchup! For ten bucks, it was a good deal and very comparable to other establishments in the city. My boyfriend ordered the haluski. It was listed under \"dinners\" on the menu so we assumed it was going to be a huge bowl. Wrong. For ten freaking dollars, he got a bowl filled with 1/4 of haluski. We couldn't believe it. Not only did it take forever to come out, but it is a shame that management feels the meal is worth that much. It honestly could have been passed off as a side. HUGE rip off. He enjoyed it, but nowhere near worth the ten bucks.   Now here's what Scratch needs to work on-- It took someone a few minutes to seat us and give us menus just to wait another five or so minutes to have the waitress come over to grab our order. Both staff members didn't come off as friendly. I felt a sense of entitlement for some reason and I didn't feel truly welcome. Almost like they were better than me. Very pretentious. I understand the place just opened and they have to work out kinks, but staff is a major MUST. Don't hire people who don't understand customer service.   Following up with food and service, because my boyfriend was obviously still hungry after his meal, he ordered a burger to go. We waited, waited and waited at our table for it to come out. Finally, we noticed a brown bag was put out on the bar. It probably sat there for about five minutes till the waitress brought it over to us. We couldn't believe that the food sat there to get cold. I understand she was the only staff member at this point, but before serving drinks to a huge party of about six people, maybe she should have rung as out and sent us on our way. No sense of urgency.   I honestly want to give this place two stars, but I'm being generous due to the quality of my burger and atmosphere. I would like to stop back for their drinks because their cocktails looked fun and decently priced. However, I may wait a few months for them to work out kinks before returning. Hopefully management reads this and takes my advice.",

    "text": "Scratch is ok, but I don't know how often I will be heading back.   It's about a 2.5. I was going round up to 3 stars, but as I wrote more of the review, I realized how little I enjoyed it, so 2 it is.   Went recently for trivia night, which was fun, as most of these are around town! We met friends there after being assured there was food, and headed down for trivia and a late, much needed, dinner.   So it was cooked pretty rare (and with no asking how well you would want it cooked,)but the burger was very tasty. Though at $12 and served with 0 sides, not something I was happy to pay for and would not order again. But I was starving. My friend's poutine was pretty good too, but again. 9-10 bucks. Way too expensive for fries with gravy.   Actually, I don't know if I'd pay again for...any food on the menu? The rest of the offerings, aside from the salads-which sounded pretty good, were not things that I really enjoy. The menu was pretty limited...I'm not sure if it was that way for late night only? Or if that's just how small it is all the time. There was very little to it, not what's shown here on the yelp menu page.  The drinks were limited too. And though my signature cocktail was delicious, I had two drinks at this bar and did not feel a buzz *at all.*  And I'd barely eaten all day!  And I'm a total lightweight!  So, just order beer/wine order with care?    Our server was totally friendly, but it took 40 minutes to get our checks, pay, and leave at the end of trivia. Splitting checks is a pain and I get that, but they were not busy and it shouldn't have taken anywhere near that long. We'd been planning to hit up another bar after trivia, but when it was almost midnight as we left, I started the party killing trend and just went home.  Overall, good food but not worth the prices. I raise an eyebrow at the yelp rating of $$ (under 30pp) Good luck getting an actual meal under $30 here",

    "text": "Came here a second time because my first visit was so good. I'm sad to say my second visit was a great disappointment.   The wait was forever long for our party of three. I think the problem with this place (in terms of wait times) is the tables are way too large and they'll seat parties of two at tables that seat six. The menu was small before and it is still small. They replaced the Reuben with a cheese steak this time. We were expecting the quality of food to be the same but sadly, it was not. Our table ordered the soup of the day (cream of cauliflower and leek), mac and cheese, gumbo, halusky and cheese steak along with several cocktails. Of all the dishes we sampled, the soup and mac and cheese were the best. In fact, we could've licked the bowl clean after the mac and cheese. We added hot sauce to it for an additional $.50 and it was worth it. The worst was probably a tie between the gumbo and the cheese steak. The gumbo was basically a shredded beef stew, lacking much depth of flavor. And the cheese steak consisted of mostly bread. The roll they used was perhaps too thick for their small portion of sandwich makings. I remember raving about the homemade pickles before but they fell short this time. I don't think they were ready as pickles yet; this time, they were basically just slices of cucumbers. I really hope they're not cutting corners now after having found some success.   Darn. I really thought this was going to be a gem of Pittsburgh but after tonight, I will sadly not be returning any time soon.",

Did not play it. A comfortable dining area that was not real busy when we were there.  Started with the Ripe Tomato crostini that was very tasty with brie and a balsamic glaze.  I questioned, before ordering, if the tomato was ripe and not greenhouse tasting.  Our waitress assured me that it was ripe and tasty, she was not wrong, very good tomato along with tasty cheese and a wonderful balsamic glaze.  For the main course I had the Cricket-Chorizo taco.  The taco was OK but really lacked much flavor except for the cilantro, maybe I was expecting more.",

Great atmosphere, a pinball machine, reasonable prices and GREAT food. The owner, Don, is usually there and is extremely welcoming and hospitable. I forgot on two different occasions to check in with my Open Table reservation before our meal, and he very kindly took care of it both times to make sure I got my points for the reservation.   I've had a few different servers and they have all been wonderful! Rich took great care of us during brunch and was so friendly and personable. Noel was our server on multiple occasions, including a huge party of 11 for dinner, and we were all SO impressed with her service!  Their cocktails are great. My favorite so far was a warm Jasmine drink that had a dried Jasmine flower that slowly bloomed as it steeped. Now, the food....OH THE FOOD. This place is great to go with a group because they offer a lot of small plate options that are great for sharing. I've had the poutine with mushroom gravy, arrancini, tacos, chicken & biscuit, brisket hash and more...and everything has been amazing. I'm constantly impressed with the menu and the quality of the food. Check it out!",

The sour cream pound cake tasted like, and had the texture of, a cake made from scratch, a rare find at a restaurant.  The beer menu was varied, with a wide selection bottles and tap.

As for the menu on our trip to Scratch last weekend, we were all left disappointed in the food we received. A friend tried the goulash and was unsatisfied. My husband tried the tacos and gave me a bite. They were super bland. The fish had absolutely no flavor. He asked for more sauce hoping he could resurrect them, and it did help some, but not much. Then our waitress charged us for the extra sauce which was a little surprising. The portions are also super small so I'm guessing it is intended to be more of a lite bites or tapas type establishment even though you don't see any indication of that in the restaurant or on the menus. I would have loved the Reuben, Mac n cheese, haluski, cheese steak or the other items I see pictures here on Yelp but they are no longer served!",

And delicious they were.  Next came dinner.  I had the Stroganoff.  I was disappointed that the portion size was half that I remember from the last time I had the same dish.  The beef was also tough and the plate was fairly bland.  This is shadowed by the fact that the fork I was given tasted like metal with every bite. The presentation of the food on a plate was less comforting than my previous experience.  I addressed my concerns with the bartender and she was friendly and offered to bring out more grits.  My friend order the goulash.  For 16 dollars he expected a larger sized portion than the two pieces of beef and carrot on a plate.  He described the meat as slimy, flavorless, and generally terrible.  The seitan tacos were decent but took a while longer to come out as the sauce was not in on the side as ordered.  Overall we would come back for a drink due to the nice atmosphere, but the food needs some work until we will eat here again.",

The ceviche is so fresh, it has perfect balance in flavors with just a little heat. For my entree I got the beef per my servers recommendation and it was amazingly tender, the whipped truffle potatoes and carrots complimented in perfectly. My boyfriend got the chicken and did feel it wasnt enough of a portion for the price. My experience was excellent though. I hope to come here again to try more of the creative and delicious menu.",

    "text": "My first visit and came for the music, but food looked great, too.  And I always like to support a place that supports local musicians.  Classy spot in an old Pittsburgh neighborhood.  I got there early so I could eat before the show.  Food was thoughtfully prepared, fresh and delicious. An elevated drink menu with a creative collection of drinks, wines and beers. Good service from the bartender and host.  When I called for reservations the day before, the host did inform me there was a local sports podcast being broadcast from the bar prior to the show, so when I arrived, the best sounded like a typical Pittsburgh sports bar.  Annoying but I'm used to it.   I figured the sports guys would pack up when they were done and the musicians would set up. Well, the sports show ran over, the musicians started late, and the sports guys stuck around, pretty much continuing their podcast at the bar at maximum volume after the musicians started.  They continued talking thru the whole performance at top volume, paying no attention to the show.  Other guests that came for the music were equally annoyed at their disrespect.  While I realize it is hard to control which shows up at a bar, having the sport broadcast on the same night as the music makes no sense. It is not respectful to the musicians or the people who came to see them.  There are literally hundreds of sports bars in this town where these people can go and yak about sports. I was hoping this was a classy, elevated location that was bold enough to provide acoustic music in a sports town  but I was mistaken.  Please reconsider your schedule and I'll be back with my friends for the music. I still gave a good rating,  as the food and service was excellent and I'll be back someday to try the dining room.",

Small but quality beer selection. Nice mix of cocktails. We had the duck egg, halloumi, rack of lamb, and cavatappi. Each one was very well prepared. The duck egg was a soft boil with great crispy shallots. The halloumi was rich but paired nicely with a light sauce and blueberries to brighten it up. The rack of lamb was cooked to perfection and very well paired with salsa verde and shishito peppers. We topped it off with an extremely rich and delicious chocolate dessert. Something like a panna cotta or a thick mousse with coffee. Overall a great meal in a nice setting in an unexpected part of town. Highly recommended.",

It sounds like a delectable burger-- how about add a dining room fee or charge extra for the sides? Plenty of restaurants serve gourmet burgers.

The neighborhood was quiet and building is regal in a royal blue! I couldn't wait to walk inside! Greeted immediately and seated to our table. Server was knowledgeable and helpful but not pushy and did not hover. From start to finish this was an amazing experience with beautiful, flavorful dishes one after another. We started off with drinks and Giardinier seasonal pickles (which by-the-way is so much MORE and NOT pickles but PICKLED), I never knew green beans, celery, cauliflower and carrots could taste so delightful! Light, refreshing and only enhanced our appetites for what was to come! We had Sweet & Sour Pork Belly and the Fresh Cod (be sure to see the pics and descriptions), side was a delicious polenta! After pleasant conversation, enjoying delightful ambience and music (not too loud so we could actually hear each other) we decided to box some of the main course to enjoy the Olive Oil Cake. OH-MY-Goodness! How divine! A crispy, yet moist, flavorful cake on its own but then had all these incredible layers of fruit, cream and warm perfect pistachios and dusted in sea salt! It hit all the taste buds with an explosion of delight! GO to this place!!! Do it now!!!! You will NOT BE SORRY. I cannot wait to go back!! Mmmm....oh, and those leftovers - the BEST leftovers EVER!!! drooling yet?",

We were actually the only people at the restaurant for the entire time we were there (3-5:30) which was shocking.   Luckily, there wasn't any other reason other than weird timing that the restaurant was empty. Our waitress recommended ordering a bunch of plates to share, which we ended up doing. The arancini were not your typical arancini...but that didn't mean they weren't delicious. They fries were obviously freshly cut: potatoey pillows of fluff (other reviewers were right though...the ketchup didn't get the seal of approval from your heinz-loving guests). The chicken tacos were great, but the best thing we had was the mixed grilled veggie platter.   I had the strawberry mojito as a drink (which they also made virgin for one of our guests) which was refreshingly delicious! I really hope they start to fill up and get the recognition they deserve...I can't wait to go back myself!",

When we walked in there was an area that had a bar and some tables and the other side/room had a lot more tables.  We got there around 6pm and there wasn't a large crowd yet but was filling up throughout the night.  We started at the bar and had all of their signature cocktails.  The Pendennis Club was by far our favorite.  It had a nice chocolatey taste, but all of the cocktails were all delicious and the bartender was very friendly.  After drinks, we sat at a table across from the bar for dinner.  For appetizers, we had the Ceviche, Cheese, Pickled Vegetables, and Marinated Olives.  They were all very delicious, the Ceviche was different (almost vegetarian and they come on a cucumber slice) and was definitely a winner in our book.  For dinner, we all had something different to share amongst each other.  We had the Lamb Stew (2 portions to make it more of a bigger meal), Pasta Citronette, Barramundi, Beef Bourguignon, Pan-Roast Chicken, and grits.  The stew was awesome and the pasta had a nice lemonly flavor. The Barramundi was a really tasty fish, the beef was delicious as well as the chicken and the grits.  Honestly, every single meal was amazing and so delicious. The waiter was extremely friendly as well. It was a great time, and the food and drinks were outstanding.  I would definitely go back in a heartbeat and would recommend Scratch as a must go.",

It's a little pricy and your traditional \"small plate\" type of dinner but the quality of food and drinks were spectacular! Highly recommend it. Especially the small plate: Burrata and the Duck. Large plate I would recommend the squash!!! So yummy!",

    "text": "I had a great time at Scratch with friends! We made a reservation through Open Table for an early dinner and were pleased that it wasn't too packed when we arrived - we were able to have a drink at the bar before moving to our table. The bar area has plenty of seating and a large drink menu. We loved that there was a small area to the side with board games.  The dining area is cute and we loved that each table had a different set of salt & pepper shakers and the window seats had cat pillows! We sampled several small plates and enjoyed everything. The beets had great flavor.  Scratch is a good place for a special night out. I don't think we'll be regulars, since it is a bit pricier. But we're glad we tried it out and will likely visit again to celebrate something special (or to sit and have a beer while playing board games).",

Knowledgeable and efficient service.  Varied menu of small and larger plates.  We started with the Ful Madames which is a nice change up from hummus.  The kitchen sent out the Lardo which was appreciated and enjoyable.   Delicious but don't tell your cardiologist.  We then tried the two soups.  The Gazpacho was good, although we prefer a diced chunky style rather than pureed.  In fairness there were  some diced cucumbers and radishes added to the top of the puree. But the Corn Soup was outstanding.  Really delicious and satisfying.  We then went with the Gnudi, also very good, and the Lamb Ragu which was deep and flavorful although, the angel hair seemed more like ramen.  Just an observation not a complaint.  We finished with the mascarpone panna cotta which was also really good.",

I've read this in other reviews and it's my only reason for not giving 5 stars -I had to google a lot of the terms on the menu. I don't claim to be super well versed in culinary terms but I also get out quite a bit and some of this was beyond me. Regardless the service was great and I didn't have anything that wasn't outstanding. Our foursome got the 40 mike salad, pickled vegetables, asparagus and some other small plate (hallouli?? Something like that) and it was all outstanding. My amberjack could not have been better and the tomato/yogurt it was served with was unmatched. Owner stopped us on our way out and was nice. Supporting locals business is easy when it's this delicious.",

    "text": "I am newer resident of Troy Hill, but because my mother grew up here with my grandparents, I am all about supporting local business. I love seeing new faces and things come to the Hill, so this is actually my second time coming to Scratch. I will still be coming for a brunch sometime soon as it is on my to-do list!   I brought my mom here for her first time, hoping to grab a light meal and check it out. We always went to Billy's for a fish sandwich when I visited my Grandma, so it always brings back fond memories.   When we both read the menu, I truthfully had to google a lot of the food items that were listed. Slightly intimidating, and different but change isn't  necessarily a bad thing! I was looking forward to getting the poutine that I loved so much last time to see it was no longer on the menu :(  Regardless, we wound up getting two \"seasonal vegetables\" or salads.  1) The Apple - Hit the spot! (Celery, Peanut, Aged Gouda, and buttermilk) Highly recommended and delicious! As our waitress described it \"an afternoon snack in a bowl\".  2) My mom got the chicory salad. (Endives, radicchio, citrus, walnut, currant, herbs) Truly, not bad either.  Service was good, atmosphere feels like you're not on Troy Hill, but it does bring in some new people.  What I would recommend is some staple food items that are big hits at the restaurant, consistency is key! Or as someone previously wrote - a bar menu with a few Troy Hill staples (burgers, Pittsburgh salad, fish sandwich). I think that would bring in more locals.  Hoping to see to see some changes here!",

    "text": "Soooo this one is tough. Please let me start this review by saying when people walk into your restaurant the appropriate greeting is \" Good evening and welcome to....\" Not, \"Can I help you\" as though the garbage man came in through the dining area.. So that was strike one. This place is also not easy to find and about as far off the beaten path as you can get. Parking was also not great. So to continue on my initial contact I was asked if I had a reservation. Now that's not uncommon even at opening but after being there for over 30 minutes there were two tables. So please refer back to my comments on how you greet guests....Ok let's try and get past this... So we ordered a vieux carre and a gimlet and they were both great cocktails. I looked over the menu and please let me clarify this is in no way a two dollar sign establishment. No worries there,I have been fine dining all week. My yellp record will support this. The menu was a bit limited. We ordered some olives and the lamb rilllette as a starter. I was encouraged to order everything at once and we requested some more time. Not well received.  So after watching complimentary cocktails given out to the table next to me I am perplexed? I hope they are regulars. The server comes back to the table and asks what we would like. I say I am still waiting for the lamb rilllette... I watch her write it down and go and place the order.. why are they just placing the order?? To make it worse she points out our table to the ball hat wearing kitchen staff in shorts and the exchange does not look pleasant. Ok now I'm done. If you are.a local I guess you can try this. I'm a Native son from out of town. The rilllette was good looking and the cocktails were good but not enough to warrant a trip up this hill to have horrible service. Sorry Yelp fans keep looking",

I loved the fresh English pea salad and the black rice arancini...outstanding! Cocktails are great but may be viewed as pricey for this neighborhood. The owner is a fabulous and welcoming host.

The hostess did this weird thing of giving us the worst table, alone in the bar next to a drafty door, and then gave us like the next worst table when we asked to move. Each one is different, part of the eclectic, and appealing, decor. The few best looking tables were unoccupied by anyone the entire night. Not sure of the logic; maybe they were hoping for some more glamorous drop-ins. That being said, the service was pretty good, and the food was really outstanding. Lots of labeled vegan and gluten free options. Would def go again.",

We came in last Saturday during Restaurant Week and will definitely be back, many, many times. We had a couple concerns about parking, but were pleasantly surprised with the amount of street parking around the restaurant.   When we arrived, Mary, the hostess, greeted us with a smile and was very kind.  David, our server, was attentive and helped make recommendations about some of the starters we were looking at. He was not wrong with his recommendations! Their mushrooms are delicious! It was the perfect size as a starter to share. Their corn soup and peach cobbler were amazing as well. During our meal, the owner Don, stopped by our table to check on us. We appreciated that he took the time to talk to us and make sure everything was satisfactory.  Shortly after our arrival, we had an emergency come up, and everyone was very accommodating and helpful while we had to deal with a slight crisis.  David, Mary, Don and the whole Scratch team- we cannot thank you enough for the hospitality. We will be back soon!",

    "text": "This place is wonderful. The food is superb, the staff is knowledgeable, and the atmosphere is amazing. I came to Scratch with my family on a Friday night and we left feeling satisfied but not stuffed, and with smiles on our faces.   My sister, my mom, and I are gluten and dairy intolerant (although we eat it occasionally) but the chef was very kind and understanding and went the extra mile to make sure that we felt comfortable eating at this establishment. There are multiple gluten free, dairy free, and vegetarian/vegan options at Scratch so there's something for everyone. For our appetizers, we ordered the moussaka, the baccala deviled eggs, the gravlax, the Spanish marinated mushrooms, and a special halibut ceviche. All of the appetizers were fantastic, but my favorites were the moussaka and the mushrooms. The moussaka had a creamy and thick tomato sauce that was very fresh; and the eggplant was not too mushy. The mushrooms were probably some of the best mushrooms I've ever had, the marinade was perfect and my tastebuds just wanted more.   For dinner, I ended up eating gluten and got the lamb ragu, because our server recommended it and it sounded great. It was worth it, but I actually didn't get a stomachache or any symptoms, which means they probably used a high-quality flour (since their pastas are homemade). The homemade pasta had a nice texture and the lamb was juicy and not too salty. My family members enjoyed their dishes as well, and we were so excited to order dessert. {I honestly could've eaten another lamb ragu for dessert though since it was so delicious!}  For dessert, I had the chocolate cake which was gluten free. It was so decadent and chocolaty; which made my sweet tooth extremely happy.   I would highly recommend Scratch if you are an adventurous foodie and want to have an incredible dinner experience in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I'm always thankful when I choose a restaurant based on awesome reviews from my yelp friends... this restaurant in particular, definitely lived up to the hype!   First, of course I waited until the day of to make a reservation... on a Saturday evening for tour people we were able to grab a table at 8:15. The restaurant was packed when we arrived so I would highly recommend making reservations in advance (especially if you would like to come earlier in the evening)  The atmosphere of Scratch is so artistic and cozy. One of my favorite parts about this place was that all of the tableware was mismatched.. the silverware, the dishes, the glasses. I thought it was an awesome touch... just like little pieces of eccentric flair everywhere you looked. Even the salt and pepper shakers on each table were different (we had the cute penguins)   Our food, and service was stellar. During the evening we all looked at each other and mentioned how great the night was going. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu, and pointed us in the right direction when selecting our food. She also noted that the menu is printed daily so the food rotated frequently.   I'm a vegetarian and I have to say that I was impressed with the amount of food on the menu was meatless. I did sneak a bite of the chicken liver pate and it was amazing.   Everything that we ate was extremely fresh and well prepared. The only thing I will comment on is that although the price per plate was comparable to other restaurants, the portion sizes were a bit small. The mushrooms($6) and ceviche ($10) were absolutely delicious, but the portion size was quite small. Also, my entree (trout) was small for the price, and I would have loved to have some type of vegetable with it, not just the grains.   When we received our checks some of our menu items were charged incorrectly (higher on bill then what was listed on the menu) but our waitress apologized and updated our checks with no issues.",

The choices are creative with reasonable prices and portions. We had a pasta and pork entree and, unusually, each had a desert. The food was very good overall. Service started slowly but turned out to be satisfactory. The wine selections were somewhat unusual. Bottle selections were all pretty expensive, but quite fairly priced relative to wine store costs. There were by-the-glass choices that could be bought by the bottle, but the lone Chardonnay wasn't available by the bottle. We will definitely return to try some of the other entrees.",

We sat at the bar and had some great conversation with the manager and the bartender. They were both really helpful in giving suggestions on what we should order, not pushing anything. I got a smoky bourbon based cocktail that was amazingly aromatic. My friend got a cucumber collins that was equally intense, but in a completely different way. Both were sippers with intense flavors.  For our meal, we ordered the seafood tartine, the chicken liver mousse, and the octopus. I would suggest at least 2 plates per person if you want a full meal. That said, these were beautifully plated and full of flavor. Fresh seafood, slightly metallic liver (as it should be), briny caviar. Advanced flavors, each standing on its own.",

I've had the rutabaga soup which is beyond amazing and the same can be said about the tagliatelle which is made with walnuts and ricotta.

Went there with a large group and order multiple items from the small plates and entrees.  Every dish had great flavor and was delicious.  Ditto on the desserts.  The place is billed as \"comfort food\" which it is to some extent, but I don't remember comfort food tasting this good.    It's definitely the type of place where you want to order several items and share.  I would go back in a heartbeat, but I imagine as more people find out about it, reservations will be harder and harder to come by.  You should go try it now before it becomes so popular you won't be able to get in.",

    "text": "My wife and I went for a date night. Scratch is in the top 3 restaurants in the city. Unpretentious and approachable, a unique spot in the city. If Scratch were in Lawrenceville or East Liberty the chef would be up for a James Beard (that said, please don't move). Literally every flavor combination is on point, the service is amazing, and the story is awesome.  Our menu: Course 1: Marinated mushrooms Salted cod deviled eggs  Course 2: Asparagus salad Gravlax  Course 3: Lamb ragu (Special) trout cake  Course 4: Asparagus salad (it was that good)  Drinks: Vermouth flight Phantom wine 2011  The marinated mushrooms were all flavorful and unique. We were able to pick up the unique flavor of each type of mushrooms and its marinade. The salted cod deviled eggs would be our favorite bite if they were served at any other restaurant in the city.   The asparagus salad was to die for. The fresh flavor of the asparagus and truffle were mixed together to perfection. Sometimes you get a dish with truffle and all that you get is truffle. Here it was a great accent.  The gravlax which was smoked salmon, a small pancake, a fresh slaw, yogurt dressing, and citrus was a great bite and well constructed.   Our mains were delicious, there isn't any way around it. The special trout cakes with roasted vegetables was light and delicious. The lamb ragu. Wow. Typically I would think of ragu as somewhat heavy, but this bucked the trend. It was served of a great perfectly al dente angel hair and prepared with fresh tomatoes and butternut squash. The lamb was perfectly cooked and fell apart; it picked up every flavor. The sauce was not too heavy and mouth watering. I would have licked the bowl if I weren't in public.   Neither of us have the biggest sweet tooth so we opted for another round of asparagus to cleanse our pallets. Again, amazing.   Our drinks were on point. The wine list is complete with a lot to choose from and a price point for everyone. The vermouth flight was both unique and delicious. We both preferred the dry vermouth, but everyone would find something they liked.   Will be going back again soon!",

    "text": "I moved to Troy Hill in July and although we have been walking around exploring the neighborhood, we haven't really ventured into the local food scene on the North Side much. I lived only a few blocks from Scratch and have heard great things, so when I got home from work last night and really didn't feel like cooking dinner, I figured it was as good a time as any to give it a go. Myself, my 11 and 5 year old, and my 5 year old's dad arrived right as they opened at 5pm. It has a very open and welcoming atmosphere with fun decor, and the kitchen is out in the open so you can see the hustle and bustle.  This place is marked as not good for kids, and while I wouldn't bring them there during a night out meal, we were all hungry, and they are really accommodating despite not having a kids menu. They made my daughter a grilled cheese, and my son had some buttered penne, both of which they have cleaned their plates on prior occasions when their dad had brought them in.  I ordered a Troy Hill Iced Tea to sip on while I looked at the menu; it was stout and tasted delicious! I went with the heirloom tomatoes as a first, since it'll be off the menu soon, and the lamb chops as my main dish. Both were visually pleasing, very nice presentation, and both were very tasty dishes. The heirloom tomatoes were heavy on the basil, which the feta cheese did well to balance the strength. The lamb chops were perfectly cooked and the plating was beautiful!  Service was EXCELLENT, from being very accommodating to our kids, to making sure we were well taken care of. Very nice group of folks working here. The chef even came out to check on us once!  I'd love to come back and explore their menu more, everything on it sounded superb.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Thursday night for dinner with my wife.  Honestly I had never heard of Scratch before I saw it as the top rated Pittsburgh restaurant for August 2018 in an email from OpenTable.  Since my wife and I are always game to try a new place we almost immediately made reservations.  We arrived to the restaurant at around 6:20 which was a little bit before our 6:30 reservations and had no trouble getting seated immediately.  The restaurant itself is interesting from the standpoint that you walk into a large bar area first and then an equal sized dining room off to the right.  On the day that we were there the host/hostess wasn't around and so I poked our head into the dining room where we were greeted and seated.  The table where we were sat was a 2 top but was abnormally long and so I felt like I was a lot further away from my wife.  What I did like is that this allowed for multiple dishes to be comfortably on the table at the same time which often isn't the case with 2 tops.  Anyways the decor of the restaurant consisted of hardwood floors, black rooms, track lighting and windows.  There was also a side wall which was made up of squared off sections which had mirrors in a lot of them.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to start off by splitting the patty pan kimchi and duck egg.  The Patty pan kimichi was described as having  gojujang, Calabrian chili, Aleppo chili, sumac, ginger while the Jarosinski Farm Duck Egg was described as having spicy mayo, crispy shallot, chives.  I started off by trying the kimchi which had a nice subtle flavor to it.  None of that funkiness which it can have and then I was actually surprised by the rather tame nature of it considering the gochujang and chiles.  After I finished that I tried the duck egg.  While I would be hard pressed to tell you it was duck egg instead of a chicken egg I did enjoy the spicy mayo with it and loved the textural component that was the crispy shallot.  Then for my dinner entree I ordered the Cavatelli which the menu descrived as English peas, spring onion, basil, ricotta, walnut and pecorino.  The cavatelli was cooked to a perfect al dente and I loved the delicate nature of the sauce.  It both looked and tasted fresh with all of the green that was in it.  My favorite part may have been the walnuts which I initially mistook for bacon (I forgot everything that was in the pasta after ordering) only to crunch into a pleasantly nutty flavor.  Then for dessert my wife and I split the  Olive oil cake which came with house made ricotta and berries.  It was delicious as the cake was moist and the berries added some sweetness.  What really made the dish for me though was the ricotta which added a little saltiness to the dish.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Everything that my wife and I tried here was delicious and we both enjoyed our meal.",

We ordered several starters for our group of 5 and I wish I had ordered the Spanish mushrooms for myself, because they were so good I didn't want to share. The pickled veggies were perfect. I'm not a pate person, but my friend practically ate the whole thing with a spoon. I got the beef bourguignon and it was the perfect size and exquisite. The server submitted the wrong dish for a friend, but quickly fixed her mistake by bringing the right dish and left us to share the Locust Point Farm Chicken, which was bright and lovely. We ordered a bunch of desserts to share and the apple spice cake was divine and my favorite. Such a wonderful gem and worth going to regularly!",

Our table was right by the door an an awkward set up with part table seating part corner bench seating ... oh well, the food we were told was unbelievable.  Unfortunately it was just ok.  Some items better than others.  The cheese polenta/grits were a mushy miss.  The prices reflect local, day of, fresh made but portion sizes (outside of grits) were tiny.  Hopefully you'll hit them on a better night.",

We got small plates to share and I had scallops...divine. I had 2 mules to drink...very refreshing. I only wish I had gotten at LEAST one more scallop on my plate. For $30, the plate was definitely skimpy. Overall would absolutely go back and sit at the bar for a different experience. Top marks!",

    "text": "Brunch is it! This was a seriously hearty breakfast meal worth sharing among friends. We were visiting from out of town and wanted to have  a meal together on our last day. They take reservations online which was a huge help for our group of 6. The space is cozy and kitschy with mismatched dish-ware and mugs. They also serve dinner and have a bar. The only thing that was a little wonky was the service, there were about 3 different people handling out table, but instead of a seamless flow of roles, it came across confusing to us. We had to double check a couple things after ordering, but it all worked out.  Their menu changes pretty regularly, but expect local, seasonal fare, lots of vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options in the mix too. The coffee was strong and delicious, I enjoyed a couple refills. For my meal, the omelet was a serious win. I was raving about it the whole time I was eating it. Honestly, one of the better omelets I've ever had. The eggs were perfectly cooked and fluffy with the veggies and cheese all baked into the mix - sauteed and well seasoned roasted red peppers, kale, and feta. It came paired with homemade bread. So tasty! My boyfriend enjoyed the basic breakfast plate with bacon, scrambled eggs, and pan-fried home fries (tender and semi-mashed, but crispy edges). Others enjoyed the breakfast sandwich and the pancakes. Overall, everyone was super satisfied with their meals. It was an all around great time!",

We like to support local business in our area. So we chose Scratch & definitely was not disappointed. We had a toddler with us for brunch and the staff brought over a magnetic puzzle for her to keep entertained with. We knew we would return soon & we did but this time on Friday evening for Karaoke. It was again a very nice vibe where everyone seemed welcome. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The only thing that I would mention was that one of members asked for vodka & cranberry and was told that they have no cranberry because they like to use local-which is awesome. However another ordered vodka & oj and it was poured from a Tropicana bottle. 100% for local but just needs to be consistent",

    "text": "We went here last night for a birthday dinner and our experience was incredible. My husband and I decided to go early and check out the bar and happy hour. Our bartender was fun, knowledgeable, and very nice to talk with during our bar visit. He made our first experience at the bar a great one! We tried a few cocktails and a few beers on draft. I love that they place high emphasis on Pittsburgh beers, that is just awesome. The beer that I tasted was from Draai Laag and it was delicious! The bar atmosphere is great....there are games to play, couches to sit on, magnet tiles to build with, and a pinball machine! They even have a little library. I just love that!   We had a party of 5 for dinner and made reservations so our table was ready at 7. Everything on the menu sounded amazing so it was hard to order. My husband and I thought it would be a great idea to split a bunch of items on the menu so we could try more. We started with the brussel sprouts and the poutine fries. The brussel sprouts are out of this world!! I have always been a huge fan of the vegetable, but I have NEVER experienced such a remarkable blend of flavors. WOW. I am still yearning for them this morning and I just ate them last night. Seriously...the best thing EVER. The poutine was also a delight. After we devoured that course of food, we moved onto the chicken and a biscuit. We opted to try it with the maple syrup. HOLY cow...delicious!! The definition of comfort food at its finest. The flavors blended so well together. After we inhaled the chicken and biscuit, we tried the halusky and the risotto. YUM and double YUM. I absolutely loved the flavors in the halusky. Everything meshed so well and it was delightful. The risotto was out of this world...we actually shared this with the table. Everyone loved it!   Scratch is WONDERFUL. If you are looking for a comfortable place to go for dinner or a few drinks, check it out!! It's really close to some cool breweries, too!   Thank you for a great experience!",

    "text": "live just down the street and I was very  excited about a new venue opening up but unfortunately that was the end of my  excitement.  I've given them 3 chances to win me over and each visit was more disappointing than the previous.  All I want is a medium rare burger, a cold beer and fresh cut fries.  Tonight again my burger is medium well, the fries greasy and dry. I could barely swallow it, especially after I watched the bar manager put his fingers in his mouth and wipe them on his shirt and not wash his hands!  I asked for salt to try to improve the tasteless dry burger. It was served in a bullet which is usually used to serve sides of sauce in, who knows whose hands had been in there before mine!  I heard the bar manager talking to two gentlemen who called ahead to ask if they could watch the Penguins game. The bar manager stated that they do not show sporting events unless it's requested?? Is this not Pittsburgh \"The City of Champions\"!?? The menu keeps shrinking and shrinking.  There is only One kind of dessert.  One of the entrees is grilled cheese and I think that it's  $8.00.  If you cannot cook a burger, then you are in a lot of trouble!  I asked for bacon and mushrooms and the bartender had to make sure that they had them? I'm thinking big slabs of thick bacon, succulent mushrooms and a thick slice of cheese,  no not even close.  The menu states Pennsylvania cheddar cheese and it's shredded? Seriously? The bacon was thin and cooked in the deep fryer. The mushrooms are seasoned with the same seasoning they put on the fries. No flavor.   $10.00 for a small dry burger and a handful of nasty fries. I showed the bartender that my burger was over cooked. She asked me if I wanted another one. No. There were 7 people including me at the bar, two couples at the tables and a few people in the restaurant. 25 minutes for a burger.  She comps my $2.50 beer.  I will not be back. I'm so disappointed. I'm a chef. There's no excuse for over cooked food and unsanitary practices.  They could have had a gold mine. \"The Strip\" is 5 minutes away where they can order the freshest foods available to serve in this restaurant???  They also have forgotten to cater to the bread and butter that kept \"Billy's\" in business all those years! What they can't make local food from scratch? You have to work with the clientele that patronize Troy Hill and give them what they want, consistent fresh food at a reasonable price. The place would be packed for lunch and dinner. Run daily specials, put the damn game on and we're happy.  I'm left scratching my head. I wish them all the best but I think by the 4th of July they will be scratched out. Don't go by the reviews on Facebook because it's censored by the restaurant.",

The chicken and biscuit was incredible! The burger was fantastic and the fries were the best we've ever had. Even simple chicken fingers were perfect!

The bartender was making a mixed drink on the menu which was fine, but after doing so he decided it was more important to talk to some friends (or co-workers off duty) than to help someone else waiting to get served.  Finally, a different server who randomly showed up ended up taking care of me.  My buddy showed up about another 10 minutes later, and had the same experience.  We looked at each other and could only shake our heads in disbelief.  There's not much competition in the area, at least for what this place is trying to offer anyways, maybe that's why they don't seem to care about service much.",

The waitress never came to check on our table and I had to flag her down each time for another drink. Not once in about 2 hours did she organically stop to check in. Will I go back? Yes. For sure. And look forward to it. Would have given a solid 4 star rating but the service overall brings my review down to 3.",

That's how good the brunch at Scratch was on Sunday. Amongst my group of 4 we had the Breakfast Poutine, Chicken & Biscuit, Beer Cakes and 20 hr Pork Shoulder Hash. Everyone left very satisfied, save for the Beer Cakes buyer. And I agree, they were a bit too drowned in cranberry sauce and, in general, didn't seem that appetizing. The good news for me is that I ordered the Pork Hash and it was INCREDIBLE. Pork shoulder+scallions+egg+grits+other amazing stuff = SATISFACTION. I left full and happy, and at $13, it was the most expensive thing on the menu and worth every single penny. The atmosphere at Scratch is also cozy and welcoming, and the staff is friendly and quick. Unfortunately, they don't serve decaf, which I find silly considering how easy coffee is to make. But if that's the biggest brunch problem I have, then I'm okay with that.",

I chose the Rust Belt Charcuterie platter which was large, very well,priced ($13) and extremely tasty.  My wife had the Chicken + Dumplings ($14).    Excellent taps.  I had a Dry Laag. Catherine and I had well made craft bourbon cocktails.    We will come back. This was an excellent experience, very reasonably priced and worth the trip to Troy Hill!",

    "text": "Really not worth the price. I ordered the tagliatelle.  The sauce was bland, and there were not a lot of shrimp.  My husband really enjoyed his pork belly, which is why I gave the 2 star rating instead of 1. The arancini was average, nothing special. Scratch was just no where near as tasty as other restaurants at the same price point. Overall a pretty disappointing meal.  I did like the atmosphere of the bar area, would to back for drinks only.",

    "text": "Enjoyed a very pleasant evening at Scratch last night.  The atmosphere is welcoming and cosy.  Our party ordered the artichoke appetizer which was very different and delicious! The heirloom tomato salad had truly local, fresh tomatoes!  Also excellent!  We ordered the trout and the spicy lamb sausage over rice!  Both entrees were perfectly prepared and so flavorful. The green beans with the trout were a big hit!  The chef stopped at our table later in evening.  Very gracious, nice touch. We ordered the vanilla and chocolate desserts which were gone in minutes!  I liked the fact that portions were nice size not too large.  Also it was a pleasure having just a few choices for a change.  Loved the evening and will return for sure!",

The food was absolutely delicious. The main dishes were pricey given the portion size was much more like a lunch plate. That being said, it was worth the food quality.  It was REALLY cold in the bar side which is where our table was. I had my coat and gloves on. Overall I would recommend this place if you're looking for a delicious meal.",

    "text": "Wow this place has a new menu and it is really spectacular.  We had the homemade ricotta on amazing grilled bed.  So creamy.  We loved the two salads- they are really unique- the kale ceasar and the citrus salad with pistachios (blood oranges and grapefruit) with an amazing dressing which was so light and refreshing.  The gnochi was really light and the chicken was about as tender as I have ever had with a fresh lemon sauce.  The two deserts were amazing.  I have been to some top restaurants all around the world but these deserts were the best I have had- try the smores and the panna cotta.  Delicious.  Chef Brandon is a star!!!  We love that he is changing the menu and bringing new flavors.  The decor is very comfy- a great place for a great evening with friends and family.",

    "text": "I would give this less than one star if I could.  This was definitely the slowest service I've seen in a really long time.  We both had the burger and fries.  I'm not sure why the  staff kept saying \"Isn't the burger AMAZING?!\" because I'm pretty sure I could go to Costco and get a 24 pack of frozen burger patties and have a better meal than I did there.  Also, if you're going to charge for ranch on the side, you might want to give the diner more than a .25 ounce serving.  The fries were good but with the amount of salt dumped on them, you'll need about a gallon of water with your meal.  TLDR - Don't waste your time.  Go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that I WANT to like Scratch and because of that, I am willing to let minor things slide.  My first experience at Scratch was one I would consider average. I love the concept of taking you back to eating in your grandmothers kitchen. The comfort food and mismatched place settings add to the charm. I was a little put off by the tarnished silverware, but I get it. The drinks were pretty decent, but it seemed like the bartender wasn't stirring or mixing the drinks. I realized this after I got to the bottom of my first drink. The food, however, was fantastic. I am a huge Brussel sprout fan and I feel that they have some of the best in the city.  Tonight was my second time returning to Scratch. We did not have a reservation when we arrived. When we asked for a table for two, the girl replied with, \"You don't have a reservation? We're pretty booked tonight.\" I asked if there was a wait time and if we could hang out at the bar and drink. She looked at the computer and replied with, \"Looks like it's about a thirty minute wait.\" My fellow diner point out two open tables in the bar and the girl replied with, \"Well...that one is reserved, but that other is open. Let me get someone to bus it for you.\" Already off to a bad start. We get seated and our waiter, who was also the bartender, came over and took or order. He was a delightful character, very upbeat and positive. We ordered a cocktail, soup, two appetizers, and our main courses.  My cocktail arrived and was quite good. No complaints there. This was the last time we saw our waiter. Another server brought out our food...our main courses. I politely asked for our soup and appetizers which were promptly brought out to us by two other servers. The timing of things could have just been a little better. The food was fantastic once again, however we did order the pate which was a larger than average portion, but only came with four little baguette slices. When we asked for more bread, they gave us three more slices. Half way into my meal, my water glass was empty. It continued to sit empty through the meal, then through the twenty minutes we sat there waiting for the bartender/server to bring us our check. Literally sat there for 20-25 minutes with empty plates, no drinks, while the bartender continued chatting with his friend's. it wasn't until another waitress noticed the annoyed look on my face that she asked if we wanted our check. Finally here comes the bartender! All smiles to hand us our check! I work in customer service and I am the type of person that will still leave a tip for less than satisfactory service. But come on! Making sure a guests water glass is always full is rule number one for any serving job!! I still left a tip although I'm sure it's not what he was expecting. The last thing that really killed me was the fact that when we arrived, the host made it sound like it would be impossible for us to get a table, yet as we sat and ate, the restaurant began clearing out. To the point that it was just us and two other tables. Why did you make such a big out of the fact that we didn't have a reservation when we were clearly able to pick out our own table and the restaurant was empty by the time we finished our meal? I'm sorry. I really want to like Scratch, but the service is very lackluster.  I only gave two stars because I really think the food is fantastic.",

Their chicken and biscuit is incredible, and they've got a great draft selection and interesting cocktail list. They change out their menu often (a little often for my taste. I found a sandwich I loved and it was gone the next time I went...only a few days later), but I've always liked what I've gotten (with the exception of carne asada tacos, which were a little dry). The staff is very nice. We've gone for trivia on Tuesday nights, and it's been great. A really nice addition to Troy Hill.",
