I don't like many GF pizzas but enjoy this one. The wait will be a little longer than usual due to them putting on gloves and making sure its cooked right for you but its worth waiting for because they do what they should. I definitely recommend to stop there!",

Everything stands out and works well together.  You can taste the smoke on the meat and all of them have distinctive flavors.  The sauce is just tangy/tomatoey enough and the wheat crust is unusually chewy under the toppings but crispy at the edges (nice work).  The only weak point is the cheese which was there and tasty, but comparatively just holding it's own.  All in all, great pizza.  I'll definitely be having it again.",

I noticed most everyone in the place had pizza and it all looked good, but after glancing over the menu I decided on the Sausage and Peppers sandwich. The guy behind the counter who took my order was pleasant enough. He asked if I wanted my sandwich with wheat or white bread (I choose wheat) and if I would rather have a side of chips or a cup of pineapple. I went with the pineapple thinking it would be a nice contrast to spiciness of the sausage and peppers.   He even offered me a cup for water without pressuring me into purchasing a soft drink (who does that anymore).  My sandwich was ready in about 5 minutes.  The bread is tough to describe. It's obviously made in-house and it kind of resembled a toasted flat bread... delicious never the less. It came with a generous topping of sauteed peppers and onions and I was also surprised to see that the sausage wasn't a patty or a link but rather crumbled.  The sandwich was very tasty.   I have mixed emotions on the atmosphere of the City Oven. While it is well lit, very clean, modern yet casual, it was also a bit cramped. I'd say that's about my only negative on the place but it won't deter me from going back. I'd like to try the pizza next time.  Thumbs up for the City Oven.",

The margarita pizza is a little messy but worth it and the buffalo chicken is an amazing slice on a day you just need to get something great to push you through the rest of the day.   Sadly, City Oven is closing - at least their current location given a stand-off between the restaurant and the building owner.

I will miss you City Oven!  *******************************************  City Oven is a great lunch spot for those who work downtown. They have a nice menu including pizza, sandwiches, and salads. They even have lunch combos which is nice if you can't decide. They usually have a weekly special if you want to try something different.  The prices are reasonable and the food tastes great. Try the veggie pizza or the buffalo chicken pizza. Both are really good.  When you order a \"slice\" you actually get two. So keep that in mind.  The dining area is a bit small, but it's very clean and super easy to take out if you want to lunch in a nearby green area.  The service is absolutely spot on. The staff are friendly and helpful. After you're there a couple of times they'll remember you. It gets very busy for lunch but they keep the line moving and get the orders out quickly.  All in all, this is a solid lunch spot in the downtown.",

The menu does not have a lot of different options, but they seem to focus on certain things and so it well.  My group split Cajun wings and a buffalo chicken pizza.  The wings were not very good.  Definitely needed more flavor and cooked better.  Too crisp on the outside and not juicy enough on the inside.  However, the pizza really saved the place.  It was one of the best buffalo chicken pizzas I have ever had.  Each bite had a perfect amount of spicy chicken.  This went perfect with their delicious house made ranch.  Can't wait to go back and try some other pizzas and their sandwiches.",

I visit once a week or so, usually getting the lunch pair of a \"slice\" of specialty pizza (cut down the middle and pretty much the size of two slices) and a side salad for around $10. Pizza is made to order, like this veggie pizza on wheat crust, my favorite. So it takes a few minutes, but they have you out the door quickly (or you can stay and dine there; the place can probably seat 20 or so). Side salads are very good with a balsamic vinegar, spring mix, red peppers, red onions and blue cheese. Everything is quality here. They also have a frequent buyer card where you get a free lunch after 10 visits.",

It was a brown sugar blueberry bacon ricotta pizza that was actually very very very good. The reason I am giving 3 stars though is because I also tried the plain pizza and for me, I judge a pizza place on their plain pizza. Also because that Pizza Week special was only available during that time. The plain slice just was not good. I am confused by some of the reviews, but everyone has a different taste in Pizza. I've eaten a good deal of pizza in my life and this one just wasn't hitting.  However, if they ever do that pizza week pizza again? I AM SO THERE.",

Bit into an exceptional, delicious, wood-fired puzza. I haven't had that since leaving  NY.  HUGE, fresh dollops of Ricotta cheese topped the pizza. Not greasy! (Pet peeve: greasy pizza) Had perfect amount of garlic, mozzarella,  etc. Fantastic  crust. I ate every bit.  They have fresh salads ($7.99-9.99),  pizza, whole, or by the sluce,  on white ir wheat crust, and sandwiches. All specialty  sandwiches are  $7.99, and house sandwiches,  $4.99-6.99, all available on white or wheat, or on flatbread.  Breakfast ranges from $1-6.99.  They do catering, too.  City Oven is open M-F, 7am-3pm, a convenient walk from just about everywhere. Bon apetit!",

    "text": "Stopped by for lunch today. It was my first time but all of my bosses rave about city oven. I waited in line while looking at a menu. You can order the pizza whole or by the slice. You can also choose the crust which is awesome. I noticed a few people with flat bread sandwiches that looked delicious.   I decided on a margarita pizza. The manager was very kind as well as the employees. The pizza was ready quickly. While it was tasty, I found it to be an average margarita pizza. The sauce could have used some seasonings or flavor. It wasnt a very exciting sauce. Also they either used dried basil or it was just diced up very tiny. Larger pieces of basil would have been appreciated since its one of the main ingredients in a margarita pizza. One good thing is that i only ordered one slice, but it came up as 2 (i guess the slices are just large so they cut them in half)   I'll be sure to try them again.. maybe ordering a buffalo chicken pizza slice or a flat bread sandwich.",

It's hard to find a good pizza dough that's not too thick, thin, burnt, etc.   My personal favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza. It has just the right amount of sauce to crust ratio.  They don't throw on fried food like a lot of other buffalo chicken pizzas which I really like.   Ambiance: 3 Food/Drink quality: 4 Presentation: 4 Price: 4 Overall: 4",

Nice employees too. They were so respectful.. offered to throw away people's garbage while they were on break, said bye to me and remembered my name!
