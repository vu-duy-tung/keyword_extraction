    "text": "I ordered the \"Average Joe\" which is pretty much a cheeseburger with LTO.  It was the blandest hamburger I had ever had.  Didn't seem like the meat was seasoned at all!  I get the same thing at the diner down my street, for about a quarter of the cost, and it's better.  The bun was okay, toasted but still soft.  My husband got the \"Fire in the Hole\" and he loved it!  From the rest of the reviews, it seems to be a star on the menu.  Everything here is priced ala cart - so you have to order the burger ($8 - $12) and then sides like fries, fried pickles, etc are around $4.  They have some $10 specialty cocktails and alcoholic milkshakes, and what appeared to be a good beer selection.  We ordered a side of fries and it was enough for both of us to share.  They put Parmesan on them which was a different touch.  They taste like little garlic-bread sticks!  We also got a side of the truffle dipping cheese.  It really complemented the fries very well.  Atmosphere was relaxed on a Saturday afternoon.  There's mixed seating (hi-tops, tables, bar, and sofas/coffee tables) so something for everyone whether you're going to eat or just hang out.  Server was efficient, but I wouldn't call her friendly.  Indifferent, maybe?  Game was on and there are several TV's.  Volume can get loud.  Even though it is in East Liberty, parking was a cinch.  Use the garage across the street for free.  As we were leaving, they were setting up valet for the evening crowd.  All in all I'd say \"Eh\", but I would give it another try.  Maybe order something else next time, or spring for the Basil cocktail.",

She said that since the beer was listed as \"nitro,\" it would be smooth and have a light pumpkin flavor. The beer ended up tasting like watered down, light beer. The \"Shrooms\" burger was satisfactory, however the sauteed onions turned out to make me severely ill. We visited the restaurant on a Sunday night and happened to be the last two left in the dining room around 9:45 when the owner came to our table and curtly asked us to leave. I doubt that I will visit again because he failed to even ask how our meal was or give us warning the establishment was closing; to top it off he made it quite evident as we finished our conversation outside to pop his head out and lock the door (as if we were going to break back in to sit down). I can think of several other locally owned  restaurants where the owner would be more than happy to thank me for my patronage.",

If the place was packed, I could MAYBE see it, but a) those 4-tops are just sitting there empty, b) there's one guy sitting at a 4-top all by himself, and c) if I wanted to be snubbed by an indifferent staff, I'm not going to pay BRGR a premium for it.",

    "text": "This place is actually pretty awesome, but I feel like we managed to come at a perfect moment, just before the mad rush that forced people to wait for an hour, while I luxuriated like Caesar on a comfy couch stuffing my face with delight.  Waiting anywhere sucks, and BRGR doesn't have quite enough room to fit the herd of people that were forced to wait in the cramped entry way.  I imagine if I had to wait an hour for a burger, I'd be inclined to bitch about the font choice on the sign as well.  But as I said, we had to wait for about three minutes for our glorious table.  As the sign would suggest, this place is primarily a burger joint, though it does have an excellent bar.  I'd recommend the Button Buster for your burger, and a Scotty Karate beer to accompany.  The addition of flat screens doesn't really seem to fit in with the rest of decor.  For the most part, it seems to be striving for a high end, jacket required type of restaurant, and on the other hand, you can watch women's basketball.  Service was very good for how busy it ended up getting, with a special shout out to the animated male host who was our initial welcome into the joint.  Recommended for a group of four or more.  Don't take a first date there.  We watched several awkward couples trying to politely wrap their mouths around gargantuan burgers.  OH!  And try an alcoholic milkshake, because, we're all going to die from something, and it might as well be from a novelty drink.",

    "text": "I have always had a good experience at BRGR.  My boyfriend and I usually share our burgers with each other so I have tried a good amount of different burgers there.  I have had the Kobe Beef, Shrooms, Gobble Gobble, and I believe some sort of Asian inspired burger that they don't seem to have on their menu anymore.  Every burger I have had has been juicy and delicious. I always get a good medium or medium-rare piece of meat with great bread.  If you're really hungry, go for the Kobe.  Not only is it delicious, it is also huge!  I always get their perfectly cooked and crisped thin(ner) cut fries with the AMAZING truffle cheese whiz.  It is really what makes every trip great.  I don't think my meal at BRGR would be complete without the fries AND truffle cheese whiz.  It is so good it actually inspired me to go and try and make my own truffle cheese concoction at home!   But of course, it never comes out the same as BRGR's.  But I digress...  I wish I could write more about the place but almost everyone knows what a burger tastes like, right?  All I can say is that I will vouch for BRGR and think their burgers are pretty darn good!",

Overall, it mostly satisfied my need for a beer and a burger but for a burger-centric restaurant, I expected a better than average experience.",

For 7 o'clock on a Friday night it was pretty slow. We got seated right away and our waitress seemed almost bored, constantly checking on us which I guess is better than not. Now on to the food. We all had the summer shandy cocktail, which was citrus vodka, yuengling and lemonade and it was delish. For apps we had the chips and crack dip and also the fried grilled cheese. Both of which were delicious. We had to get a second order of the chips, the cheese dip is that good. We all had burgers which were also good. Was it OMG best burger I ever had in my life, no. But all in all, great service, great drinks and a good burger = a good time. Oh and they also have valet for $3 which is a deal because parking down there can be a nightmare!",

    "text": "Warning: I've been here a lot, so this will be a long review.  I've always had a fairly pleasant experience when I have eaten here. The cocktails are excellent (whiskey shot with pickle back, basil gimlet, etc). The service is usually prompt and courteous. And the outdoor seating is nice.  Things I disliked:  -You are limited in the drinks you can order if you are sitting in the outside seating upstairs. Um, what? You mean the servers can't walk up and down the stairs to the main bar? I work at the three-story restaurant...we don't limit what you can order according to each floor.  -The baskets. I can't cut my burger in half very easily when it's in a basket. Additionally, the burgers are so greasy that by the end of the meal, the paper in the basket is falling apart, and it's disgusting.  -Not enough cheese whiz for the fries. It is the smallest cup ever given, and I'm not a cheese-eating monster.  -The tuna burger is gross. It is mashed up tuna pieces formed into a patty. Why can't they just have a tuna steak so I don't feel as if I will become ill by ordering the tuna rare, as I usually would with Ahi tuna? If it was a tuna steak, it would be an excellent sandwich.  -They don't take reservations...not even for large parties. So, on my roommate's birthday, we waited over an hour for a table even though we called ahead and they said they would save two tables for us. I understand a no-reservation policy, but for large parties, I think they could make an exception. It wasn't even a Friday or Saturday night.  -Pretty limited menu. And you can't modify anything. What if I like every single thing on a burger except the spicy cheese? Or I don't like onions? Come on. It's really not that hard.  -The crack dip is really not very good. It just tastes like cheese.  Things I like:  -The button buster. Oh my goodness, delicious. Especially with some of that stone-ground mustard. Nomz.  -The salmon burger. All those ingredients, arugula, the aioli, bacon...all go so perfectly together. It is an incredible burger. And the salmon is always cooked just perfectly so that it isn't dry.  -Service is always fast. I guess that's easy when your menu is basically all burgers.  -The truffle cheese dip. But, see above.  -The basil gimlet. That drink gets me messed up every time! In a good way, of course.  All in all, it's a great place to have a burger, but there are definitely some things that I'd like to see improved before I can give 4-5 stars. Will I be back? Absolutely. Is Burgatory better? Yes.",

First my boyfriend and I wait several minutes before even being acknowledged by the waitress and another several before getting menus. I decide on plain and simple, The Average Joe. Im fine with an up charge for fries but I've never seen a burger at a restaurant that doesn't at least come with chips! I give in to the $4.50 fries because I like a side to my burgers. The food at least came quickly but our waitress neglected to bring silverware, napkins, ketchup etc. After finally getting settled with all the proper condiments and utensils I bite into my food. The burger was over cooked and seemed to lack a juicy flavor. You could get a better and cheaper burger from 5 guys! Our waitress was not great at refilling drinks and even forgot when asked. I do think they were understaffed but the neglect was ridiculous. Overall for a high end burger joint they did not deliver on service or quality of food for the price you are paying.",

The theme inside seemed slightly confused-- sort of a classier place but still with sports blaring on a million screens. Cozy though.  The lady I went with has nearly the total opposite diet I currently eat (vegetarian vs low-carb carnivore), and yet we were both able to easily find things we thoroughly enjoyed.  I ordered a fairly standard burger (sans bun) which came as a lettuce wrap.  I can't put my finger on what it was-- perhaps higher quality ingredients-- but I savored every bite.  Overall a great experience, and the first place in a long while that I'm actually excited about going back to soon.",

    "text": "I finally got my fried pickles! Brgr is bustling with the young professional crowd. Clean modern decor with booths and swirling metallic wall art, a place to mingle with friends, and dim lighting that always adds an air of privacy.  We arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday evening, I was prepared for open tables but we were put on the, hold for it... 1hour wait! Wow! Isn't Brgr Pop pop pop POPULAR. We decided to wait for the rest of our party and have a seat at the bar. The beer selection is interesting, I had a Guinness draft, usually my beer of choice because it is supposed to be the \"Healthy beer\" right? Plus it tastes great with savory grilled burgers!  The rest of our party was running late so when they came to get us and they had not yet arrived they kept us at the top of the list. We struck up a conversation with the bartender while we people watched. One of the managers was walking around like he was some sort of FBI agent. He was Intense and had us giggling!   John was the bartender, formerly from Ceviche downtown, so so happy to run into him because he makes a mean Caipirinha. Best in the burgh that I have tried. When warmer weather roles around I'll be packing my sugar in the Raw packets(they only have simple syrup at Brgr...Ick) and caling ahead to see if John is there to muddle me that tart, exhilarating summer drink.  The couple we were meeting are great friends of the executive Chef so we were sat instantly and ordered right away. I had the fried pickles as my starter. They came out in a short metal cup. They come with 2 pickles one big, one small. Hmm not very impressive. I took a photo. My 1st fried pickle experience didn't have me begging for more. I let everyone sample them and our couple ordered them too. I thought the grease in the batter was slightly off.   My Brgr knocked my socks off! Wow really bees knees! Juicy, tender, with the hint of that smokey char grilled taste. Braised beef short ribs on the \"Button Buster\" white cheddar, crispy onion perfection. Fries sold separately, they have a truffle cheese wiz and a truffle aioli (the aioli not on the menu) that had me licking my fingers! Must have!  Our friends had the Kobe beef brgr and next time I would like to try, possibly with fois gras! Interesting.   For dessert I sampled the Chocolate Covered Cherry shake, it tastes exactly like those old time chocolates given to grandma. I was so full that I had no room for dessert!   I can't wait to bring J and sit on the rooftop patio!   Notes: Valet parking $3, Get there early because it's busy, ask for separate checks beforehand because they didn't want to split them afterward",

    "text": "It was a really nice Saturday afternoon here in the 'Burgh, this spring has yet to be nice, so I was taking advantage of the nice weather and having a meal out where I could eat al fresco. BRGR came to mind, I have passed by this place and knew they lifted the garage style door on nice days, and sure enough it was opened.   My big complaint with this location is parking, DO NOT park in the garage located across the street from BRGR, you will be towed, signs clearly mark read \"parking for East side only\", BRGR is on the west side.....* grumble* I found street parking, and put 4 quarters in the meter, yes meters are watched on Saturdays!  Forget everything I've said about bland, boring, fall apart vegan burgers, BRGR has got it right, and wow, with a burst of great flavor. I had the Tree Hugger, awesome name and very flavorful! A falafel style burger that came on a baguette with pickled cucumber, roasted red pepper, and tomato. Delish, and Jamie, fellow vegetarian friend of Joe, had the tree hugger as well, only he had it with the parmesan fries (4 bucks al a cart) which he said were outrageously good. I had my burger with the best cole slaw (3 bucks al a cart) ever, very course cut cabbage with golden raisins, celery seed, carrots, caraway seed, and a wonderful sweet vinegar slaw dressing that makes primanti bros slaw seem like swill. The falafel burger goes great with any of the IPA's they offer on draft. Something about an IPA with the flavors of cumin, indescribably good.   The decor is awesome, this place would look great in NYC, San Fran, LA, or any big city, but I'm happy they are here. Very big city looking without being snobby.  Well, after eating eating here, this totally throws my burger loyalty out the window, BRGR is my restaurant of choice now!",

It was a decent experience, but Burgatory is way better for quality, ambience, milkshakes, and general value for money. I ordered one of their beef burgers with spicy Sriracha and an added fried egg. It was a good burger, but I just wasn't wowed. My fiance had the fish and shrimp party burger, which he said was good. None of the burgers come with fries - they only come with a slice of pickle - so we had to order sweet potato fries on the side. The fries were too salty for our liking. Service was not great - servers felt like they were a little snobby and disinterested in their job. Overall, 3 stars for a very 'blah' experience that wasn't very memorable.",

During my first visit I didn't order food, only the spiked milkshake, and it was amazing, a little sweet for my liking, but nonetheless, great! During my second visit I had the Grilled Cheese bites, which were great, a perfect blend of crispy and butter bread with a tomato soup for dipping. I also had the Smokehouse Bison Burger, which was cooked perfectly to the temp i requested and had a spiciness that wasn't overbearing, but really tasty! Their sweet potato fries are really good as well, I like mine dipped in honey!",

    "text": "Poor Brgr! I went here about a week after I went to the new Wingharts burger joint down in Market Square. I think Brgr would have held up in the bigger better burger contest if I had tried this burger first. Since it was after Wingharts KILLER char-grilled burger deliciousness, it's sadly going to get a much lower rating.   Don't get me wrong, the shroomz burger at brgr (I had to...) was tasty, but it just doesn't hold a pickle to this other burger. And by pickle, I mean the tiny little gherkin they perch on the top of Brgr's burgers.   The thing I will rave about was the boozy milkshakes. I wish it was humanly possible to slurp down 5 of these like you can any other delicious cocktail, but really, that's not humanly possible without feeling like you're going to die. I got the boozy Almond milkshake, which had Ameretto and Kahlua mixed in with ice cream. To top that off, there was sugary almond treats at the bottom. My heaven would include these milkshakes being served at the pearly gates entrance!   The service initially was so so. I had called earlier in the day to try and reserve a table for our party of 15. The person on the phone was a little pissy and told me they don't take reservations. I said, well I just want to let you know then that we have this large party coming in. He said, and I quote, that they only had 70 seats, with some being couches and two tops. Those 15 seats would take up most of their seating. I'm no mathematician, but really dude?! Do they not understand that we'll be spending a lot of money, especially with the part of the crew that likes to overindulge on the booze.   So we get there and the hostess, and what I assume are the manager, are just walking back and forth around an L shaped area of seats and a longer set of seats. I went up to them and was like....we'll squish, just put that long set of tables together. I worked at a restaurant for 5 years, I picked a thing or two up I suppose. After that, service was just fine!   I would totally go to Brgr again and space out my boozy milkshake intake after a meal, but I'm not sure I would come back JUST for a Burger. So for Brgr I say no burger but a round of boozy milkshakes for ALL!!",

They also had TV's positioned conveniently all over the restaurant so that every seat was able to see one.  I was pleasantly surprised whenever I opened up the menu as we had been planning on visiting the Cranberry location but ended up switching to the East Liberty one at the last minute.  The East Liberty menu has a nice list of unusual burgers while the Cranberry one seems to be a make your own, much like the Burgatory.  For dinner I decided on the Thai Pork and Shrimp Burger while my dining partner decided on the Shrooms Burger and we got an order of fries and fried pickles on the side.  The shrooms burger had a nice taste and the mushrooms added some earthiness while the Pork and Shrimp burger was nice also although I am not so sure where the Thai part of the name came in.  The fries were crispy and cooked to a nice temperature while the fried pickles were also good although disappointing in serving size.    The bottom line for me is that the food was decent and reasonably priced so I would come back to BRGR in the future.  I am not sure that it would be the first sit down burger joint on my list but the food was good enough.",

    "text": "Foie Gras burger was Da Bomb!  It took me a while to come and try this place because I saw that the rating on Yelp was only a 3.5 star. But after finally deciding to give this place a try, I am surprised that the place only receives a 3.5!! Granted this may not be THE BEST burger place I've ever had,  but so far it has impressed me for the two times that I did come here.  If you're willing to dish out an addition 13 dollars, definitely try their Foie Gras burger. There is no way that someone would not give this place a 4 star after trying that! Once in a while, that additional $13 dollar is totally worth it. But even if you're not in the mood to pay that much for a burger, there are still plenty of other options. I love mushrooms, so I tried their Shroom burger, which in my opinion, was also very good!! Love the mustard aioli they add, gives the burger a burst in your mouth feel when you eat it. My fiance tried their Turkey burger with lettuce wrap, and it's pretty delicious for people that's going for the healthy option. Of course, go with the REAL burgers if you're going for the full flavor.   BRGR also offers the some pretty interesting drinks that you won't find at many other places - the Beertails. My fiance loves trying their different Beertails, where a beer is paired with a shot of hard liquor and a very unique chaser. I think they offer some pretty interesting combinations that's worth a try.   Aside from Winghart, this is probably my favorite burger joint in the Pittsburgh region - I would chose here over both Stack'd and Burgatory when I am feeling for a good gourmet burger.",

Thank you Brenna/Jenna (I feel like an asshole that I forgot...whoops) whatever your name is ladyfriend for the wonderful service.  Went in to eat with my ladyfriend Terra sat at one of the lovely high-top tables near the window. Ended up ordering their Thai Pork and Shrimp Brgr and their King Salmon. One half for me the other half for Terra.  Thai Pork and Shrimp - Simply delicious. The end.  King Salmon - Unfortunately this one wasn't so delicious. Terra has requested for her initial temp for this sandwich to MR (medium-rare) and Brenna/Jenna let us know that their MR would be more on the rarer side and Terra requested just as long as it wasn't translucent and not dry to go for M(medium). Upon shoveling the Thai Pork and Shrimp BRGR down we made our way over to this sandwich and it didn't quite hold up very well the texture wasn't quite what we expected (the bad way) so we were a wee bit disappointed. Oh well. You can't win them all. I'd say stay away.  Brgrs brgrs aside we definitely did start our busy day with a milkshake. I was feeling kind of seasonal so I ordered The Great Pumpkin although it was a pretty tough decision between the peanut buttery \"The King\" shake though. I requested to have an extra cup be brought over to share which Brenna/Jenna graciously brought over. I kid you not happiness in the pants. :)  All in all fun times at BRGR will go again soon. Next time maybe Ill do dessert.",

Either way, I've went with some good ole 'Merican red-meat-eaters every time, who attested to the excellent in the beef patties.  So I've tried three burgers personally (in ascending order of worse to best): -The Tree Hugger (falafel burger): Dry, tasteless, just about the worse falafel I've ever had. -The Locavore (lamb burger):  I think lamb is just not for me.  I don't blame the burger so much in this case since everyone else I was with who tried it, loved it. The relish was quite good and the mint was a nice touch. -California Lovin' (turkey burger): Overall, excellent.  I could have done with less alfalfa and more avocado though.  The bread is uninspired, which is my main general burger compliant.  The pickle also made it a little soggy.  But put better buns around those burgers, and I will upgrade by a star in a second.  The appetizers were all great and large enough to share amongst 2-4 people.  I strongly recommend the BRGR fries and the onion rings.  The milkshakes would earn a 5-star review alone if this were a milkshake shop, but it's called BRGR so no go.  Here's the run-down: all excellent, boozy or not!  The Bourbon Cherry float was STRONG on first sip, since until the ice cream melted a bit not a whole lot of cherry soda could fit into the glass.  Luckily, the waitress left the soda bottle so I could fill as I went.  The Salty Caramel was also incredible, but the prize for best milkshake has to go for the White-Russian-In-Shake-Form called The Dude Abides.  It's not on the menu anymore (for shame!), but the staff is pretty cool about making it anyway if you ask.  The decor was a little trying-too-hard-to-be-trendy.  It took about 5 minutes to seat a party of four at 7pm on a Saturday, but it was taking about 40+ minutes for groups that size as we were leaving around 8:30pm.",

Normally I just go with my girlfriend and the experience is great. However today I went with a party of 6 to show how nice it is, how good the shakes are, and just how the comments about them being snobby are False.   Well, today proved me wrong in every way. I went in and we waited at the bar for our party to all get there (that is normal). But when my party arrived, I went to the hostess and said our party was here and she said give me 5 minutes to get your table set up. I wait 5 minutes and walk upstairs to the open air roof. No table... No wait staff even expected us.   While sitting there, we all ordered shakes and said no food right now. We got a look like, why are you even here? Then sitting close to the upstairs hostess, I hear her say to the downstairs staff; \"Make sure the people you send up are ordering food.\"  We ordered side orders, but I did not go there to eat. I went only for their shakes.  I know my friends and I spend more money drinking than eating. Especially when the shakes are $8 and the burgers are $12.   We left shortly after hearing the comments from the staff because it was an environment we did not want to stay in.",

Going to have to remove a couple for a single bathroom per gender (what small bladdered planet do you come from?! The place is half bar!!) Apparently when you ask \"The burger doesn't come with any mayo or anything on it, does it?\" and they say, \"No.  No mayo\"  It is code for 'we will now slather both sides of your burger with mayo.  And while I love an edgy place, the reality is I have no doubt cool edgy 'chef' type would surely spit my a redo for someone whining about mayo, so there's that. While I'm in favor of uplifting the neighborhood as much as the next suburbanite, the folks doing some low riding drive by's with their bass blaring makes it necessary to read the lips of the people you are with.   A much needed funky joint and good vibe but don't bring the kids and run serpentine style back to your car if its after dark.",

However, the wait staff was as bad, rude, inattentive and will prevent me from returning.  We had a group, called ahead, the day before and the day of, several times.  We arrived was told it was going to be a bit, so we all got a couple drinks and waited..and waited.. and waited.  ended up getting tables that were not together and not enough seats for our group.  i know things get busy, but we were treated very rudely and told to \"make do with the seats we have\" and many more snippy, impolite comments.  Even waiters were bumping into me while i was waiting for a table and giving me attitude (\"you have to get out of my way\").  The wait and the tables being apart could be forgive, the way we were treated, not forgiven. We were spending a lot of money, lots of drinks, food, etc.  I hate to give a poor review, but honestly this was the rudest i have ever been treated at a restaurant.  I will not be back to BRGR.",

I'm fine with its medium rare-ness, but I think a burger should be a warm, not room temp. The bun was soggy due to the juice from the pickle spear served along side the burger. But the fries and chips were tasty. The \"adult\" root beer float I had was fine for what it was, but I probably wouldn't get it again. Overall, I wasn't really impressed with the burgers or the drinks. But the upstairs outdoor seating is great on a nice evening. The staff were very accommodating of our large group (14).

    "text": "I was really, really disappointed.  Nothing about this experience, save the pretty patio and the ho-hum milkshake, was good.  I started off with the Salty caramel Bourbon milkshake.  It really got my hopes up that this would be a place to return to.  These positive feelings were soon crushed. The bourbon was prounounced and the ice cream was good.  It needed more vanillia bean flavor and more caramel.  I also did not like how thin it was, but I suppose that might have something to do with the extra liquid from the Bourbon.  I wish they served it in a more attractive glass with garnish, to really make me feel less of a jack ass for spending $8 on a shot and a half a milkshake.  I had the 'Kobe' burger.  It was ok.  It was not worth $13, considering it did not come with fries.  The patty was well formed and the burger did have good structural integrity.  I ordered it rare (if it's real American Wagyu it should be eaten as close to raw as possible) and it made me sad.  the meat was really unevenly cooked.  Parts of it were well done and others were more towards medium.  Unacceptable.  The toppings were nothing to write home about. The boyfriend had the short rib burger.  It was even worse than mine.  The patty was poorly formed and started to fall apart as soon as he started to eat it.  He ordered it medium rare, but there was no pink to be found.   There was a quarter sized dollop of actual rib meat.  It was flavorful but it did not make up for how shitty the rest of it was. We split an order of the chips and 'crack sauce'.  I'm not sure they make the ships in house, but if they do, they had been sitting way too long.  I suspect they are actually DRRTY brand chips that they have the gaul to pour in a bowl and serve me for $5.  The sauce was  a joke.  It's caned cheese sauce like you would get on nachos at a baseball game with some canned peppers thrown it.  It was offensive to my palate and my sensibilities.     Severs/hosts in Pittsburgh must not smile.  It's been a running theme. I am baffled.  It's like they are actively trying to not be tipped.  I would not go back.  I wouldn't have minded the prices if the food had been even passable.",

I've never heard a complaint about a burger there and every single shake, spiked or otherwise, has been fabulous. Service is pretty good and even though there is often times a wait, you can have the hosts text you when your table is ready. I've only had one issue worth mentioning: I usually get the veggie burger, which is awesome, but recently tried the mahi mahi and shrimp burger. I expressed my concerns about the possible texture issues, but was encouraged by a table mate to try a different burger. I wish I could say I was wrong cause it looked so delicious, but it was the wrong texture. I'd give it 2 stars. Besides the chewy fish sandwich, everything else is worth trying.",

As for the burgers, I couldn't have a bun because of food allergies, but my mom was able to get a Gluten Free bun. The burger patties have a nice char on the outside and are extremely juicy and flavorful. I didn't even miss the bun because the patty was so good.

Such a mediocre experience.  Parking: -Zero parking in the immediate area as there are typically no spots on the street as there are many businesses around Highland St. and Penn Circle that compete for parking. Valet is available but this type of dining doesn't merit valet.   Hostess: -The entrance is nice enough but finding a table can be tricky, I smartly used the No Wait app (also used by Burgatory) to skip the lines and ensure a table was ready. I arrived with \"1 party ahead of you in line\" status on the app. When called to the hostess podium I was told we could sit at a high-top table at the bar or go upstairs and look for seating. The bar is no place for a nice dinner so we went upstairs and felt the air conditioning slowly taper off to nothing. Arriving on the rooftop area there was no airflow whatsoever on a hot and humid day. I went back downstairs to ask if we could get a regular table as it was intensely hot upstairs. Surprise surprise a table was ready. I can't imagine how some guests were eating upstairs, the AC on the first floor was appropriate for the weather.   Service: Our waiter clearly had better days, maybe he was upset he was working during the Pen's Stanley Cup game or was just over the day in general but his service was unimpressive. Does anyone have customer service skills anymore?   Food: The food was the best part of the experience which is a positive but still can't save a poor experience and two star review. I had the salmon burger which was decent but a little dry. The tater tots I ordered as a side were the best part of the meal which is a little disappointing. My girlfriend ordered fries with the famed truffle cheese wiz. I didn't care for it but I'll chalk it up to possibly not liking truffles.   Definitely won't be going back to BRGR, go next door to Spoon or across the street to Plum Pan Asia and get some much higher quality food.",

    "text": "BRGR is a convenient spot to grab a burger (...as the name suggests) on the Shadyside/East Liberty border, especially when the weather is nice enough for the upstairs deck to be open. There is plenty of seating between both spaces, and I don't remember having much of a wait during the handful of times I have eaten there over the past few years.  The menu is fairly simple and straightforward. There are a number of meat (as well as non-meat) options and flavor combinations, as well as sides and shakes. I had the Fire in the Hole burger on my last visit. I'm a fan of all things spicy, so this seemed like the obvious choice. The burger comes with pepper jack, chipotle mayo, sriracha, and a layer of jalapenos under the burger. It's all cooled down by the addition of guac. There was a ton of flavor between all of the sauces and toppings, and the heat was present but not overpowering.  My friend and I split an order of fries with the \"truffle cheese whiz.\" The fries were tasty in the cheesy, truffle-y (is that a word?) dipping sauce. The sides are pretty big and meant to share... we had more than enough food with a burger each and the fries to split.  I think it would be nice to see some fresh menu options; I don't go here too often, but it seems like the burger options have remained largely unchanged since the location opened. It seems like there is always a new burger place opening in Pittsburgh, but this is a reliable option in a good location.",

My favorite is the King Salmon, which I've had with the lettuce wrap and on a  regular bun. The lettuce wrap option is a healthy alternative, but it's most definitely a knife and fork situation.    I'm also a huge fan of their table-side sauces. With the tater tots, especially I like to experiment and  mix ketchup with the other types of sauce on offer for a variety of flavors.   On of these days BRGR I'm going to get that Grilled Asparagus salad and show you!",

My burger came out at the desired temperature and protein-style like I like (can't take the In-N-Out away from me).  With that said, I do think that the food was overpriced for what we got, nothing incredibly special in my opinion.  With regards to the service, I will say our bartender/server was very attentive and pleasant, and very helpful with the selection of our beer.  However, when we first entered the restaurant, we were not acknowledged or welcomed, and upon leaving the restaurant, we were treated the same way.  They just stared at us.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good enough, just not a well-rounded experience.",

    "text": "Having missed my bus home and being thoroughly polar vortexed, I happened upon BRGR while wandering the streets of East Liberty trying to warm up. I was there during happy hour and though $2 off drafts and the $6 cocktails looked appealing, I decided to go the granny route and order a hot tea in a trendy burger joint. The tea selection was what you'd expect it to be a burger joint, but good nonetheless because it was piping hot.   My server was prompt, professional, and friendly. She had only me and two other tables, so everything moved along smoothly. I ordered the mushroom and brie burger with a side of Cajun tots and crack dip. The burger was done perfectly medium but could of used a little more S&P. I only noticed the brie in about 1 or 2 bites because the burger was SLATHERED with the mustard aioli. A bit overpowering, to say the least, but nothing I would ever send back--after some scraping with the knife I was A-ok.   The Cajun tots were solid, and I thoroughly enjoyed the house made ranch it came with. The big cup of crack dip was entirely forgettable. It tasted like an 4 day old chili and was a weird color of orange that I just couldn't get in to. Not worth the $1.50 for me, but I'm also not a huge chili fan so it may work for some others. Not enough crack in it for me to ever order it again, that's for sure.  Overall this place was decent. Not the best burger I've ever had but certainly not the worst. I'll be interested to go back and see what their cocktail menu is all about.",

I ordered the Santa Fe hippie burger and the table split sides of fries and onion rings. I have never had a veggie burger like the one at BRGR. It was really dense and hard. It also lacked flavor. It had a slight falafel spice, which was strange with the guacamole topping. Also, the burgers are all $12-$15 and do not come with a side. At Burgatory you can get a much more delicious burger with a side for the same price. Will not be coming back here.",

    "text": "BRGR's website claims to employee an executive chef. That's interesting. An executive chef for a place that serves burgers and fried things? Why? What on earth does he do there? Time the fries? Discern if every burger is indeed medium and not medium rare? By my estimation it is absolutely ridiculous. BRGR is a burger place. The burgers aren't very special. They are burgers. Yes, you may be able to get Gouda or perhaps Gorgonzola. In the end it is a burger. Despite the executive chef possibly being a real thing, which again is an absolutely ridiculous notion, the burgers are just, well, pretty normal and certainly not special. They need to upgrade the fried things. They are not good. The fry on them is just kind of soggy.  What is special is the particular terribleness of the service and ambiance. Notably at the bar and with the selection of totally inappropriate whiny metal music dabbled with teeny bop girl scream pop. Think Katie Perry B-Sides. Think Everlast. Think some 17 year old screaming about dying young on her highly engineered track daddy payed for.  I look around the place and almost everyone is over 30. A majority of patrons over 50. Imagine the bartender, while forgetting you are there while you wait with a twenty on the table and empty glasses singing along, self assured with every word as the minutes drawl by. Sure, perhaps it was a one off night. It was Saturday at about 6pm. There were only 4 people behind the bar milling about. Perhaps, the didn't see us or anyone of the silver haired guests as they spoke among themselves, audibly enough for us all to hear, about being perfectly drunk on that one night, at that one party, that one time. Perhaps, as they sang along to the terrible, annoying, loud, inappropriately selected songs, about dying young, they were so touched with internal empathetic emotion they were transported away, far away from the bar at BRGR in East Liberty on a Saturday night in November at 6pm, to a dark room, where they fantasize about people missing them if they die young.   Them: \" Ohhhhh....My....Gawdaaaaaah!!!!!!!! I was like...just perfectly drunk. Like not too drunk to the point where you're like, you know, all sloppy. Just perfectly drunk and stuff.\"  Us...after 10 minutes with empty glasses: \"May we please get a check please.\"  BRGR look around and see whats going on in your restaurant. You are supposed to cater to your guests and not your own terrible taste.",

I got \"the brgr\" (8 oz. handcrafted dry-aged prime beef, pickled red onions, arugula, creamy blue cheese, oven-roasted tomatoes), AND got to add a healthy piece of seared foie gras. (Aside: fois gras is not so easy to find in CA anymore...). Our little party also got both the herbed fries AND cajun tater tots. Both were delicious, and getting the truffled cheez whiz was a good idea. My alcoholic milkshake was also a win.   So, after that, why only two stars?   THE SERVICE WAS HORRENDOUS.   It's like everyone who works here doesn't want to be there. They chat with themselves, they disappear for a while. If you're going to be in some sort of service position, you should look like you give a shit about the people you serve. Service was terribly spotty. The nicest, most polite person there was the busser - we asked him if he could send our server over (because we had basically been ignored for a while), and when I saw the exchange, it's like I could feel the eye-roll off his body language. And it still took a few moments longer than it should have to come over (of course, he had to finish that conversation with the other server).   It's really unfortunate that, despite the good food, I'm really dissuaded from ever wanting to come back. The people that work here just suck that bad. Although, I would highly recommend that that busser go work somewhere that he'd get more in tips - I'm sure the lackluster service that the servers provide really affect his bottom line.",

Had to wait about 30 minutes for a table (they don't take reservations for small parties).  When we were finally seated, they took us up two flights of stairs to what I believe in warmer weather is an open air roof deck.  They enclose it and add heaters to accommodate the crowds.  It took a while for anyone to even acknowledge us and get drinks.  We ordered everything all at once.  One of us ordered the \"Average Joe\", one of us ordered the \"Schrooms Burger\" and I ordered the Salmon Burger.  We also ordered some of the burger fries.  It was all just average.  By the time I food actually got to the table, it wasn't hot, just mildly warm.    I guess I should mention that the service we received was just plain horrible.  I know it was a Saturday night, but at one point, when it was clear that nobody was going to refill our drinks, my boyfriend actually had to get up and walk over to the bar and ask for a refill.   After our food was delivered, we never saw another server.  Nobody cleared the dishes away.  Nobody came by to ask how everything was.  We waited and waited for someone to give us a check so we could get the hell out of there.  Suddenly our original server showed up...a bit befuddled and apologized to us because he said he \"forgot\" that we were his table.  I felt kind of bad for him at one point when he kept apologizing and offering us dessert.  Too late.  It was only a so so food experience.  No need to go back.",

We then had a problem with the bill and instead of handling like a \"manager\" she continued saying things under her breath and rolling her eyes. I asked our waiter for her name. Apparently our waiter told her that I did so because at the end of the meal she confronted me, which I thought was also inappropriate. I told her the reason I had an issue was because of her attitude and she denied doing all of these things. When I gave her examples, she said \"well the transaction was really hard\" I said that's no excuse for your attitude and two of the ladies at the table had a \"hard\" day lost their mother and I think they made it through the meal with more grace than you.",

    "text": "Some coworkers and I came here for lunch last week, to order \"A burger, hold the vowels.\"  We were seated right away around noon on a weekday, but there was a pretty decent sized lunch crowd.  The door/window thing was open so we got a nice breeze - it can make it chilly if it isn't a warm day outside, so bring a sweater!  Our server was friendly, and was nice about waiting to take our order until our last friend came about 10 minutes later.  We desperately wanted alcoholic milkshakes, but stuck with water since we were on the clock - pity.  So we decided to split some side dishes, which came out first as appetizers.  We got the \"BRGR fries with truffle cheese whiz,\" and the \"Housemade chips with crack dip.\"  Yes, crack dip.  Apparently it does not contain real crack, so don't be afraid.  The sides were okay - I love French fries in all situations, but the \"truffle cheese whiz\" didn't add much to it.  I'm not really a big fan of processed cheese food, even if \"truffles\" are involved. I prefer plain old ketchup.  Fries were totally decent, with a little smattering of herbs and parmesan on top.  The potato chips were tasty and freshly fried, but the crack dip was essentially more cheese whiz, only this time they added sriracha instead of \"truffle.\"  It tasted pretty much the same to me as the truffle cheese whiz, and its neon-orange nacho cheese appearance was not really appealing.  So I say if you're getting sides, avoid anything with cheese.  Sides can easily be shared between several people - the four of us couldn't finish the chips and fries between us.  I'm being weird and healthy lately, so I decided not to get a regular beef burger.  I asked the server which was the best of the non-beef burgers, and he suggested the Asian-flavored tuna burger, aka the \"Love You Long Time.\"  Really?  Can't say if I was Asian I'd be a huge fan of that title (imagine ordering matzo ball soup and it being called \"big nose take all your money\" soup).  Anywaaaay, you can order it seared rare or cooked through - get it rare, tuna cooked all the way through is not yummy.  There's some avocado in there, also wasabi, sweet soy, pickled cucumber and daikon, and \"chili aioli\" which was a pretty creamy, somewhat spicy sauce.  It was all pretty good, had lots of flavor, but it was a bit heavy.  I guess I'd hoped for more sushi-on-a-bun, but the creamy sauce and somewhat messy toppings made the meal seem a bit rich.  Still, I ate most if it before I got full. Didn't think it was worth taking home.  The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and sunny.  I'd like to come back this summer for a boozy milkshake and a beef burger.  Oh, it's a wee bit pricey as well, I think the prices are better suited for dinner, so keep that in mind.  And watch out for the rcst brgrs.",

Overall, my experience wasn't horrible but it definitely wasn't great. They had a pretty cool selection of beer so that was a good start. Our appetizer was yummy - fried pickles. Obviously can't go wrong with that. But we asked for extra plates since the pickles were like 3,000 degrees and impossible to eat at first, but the plates never came. Our burgers got to our table super quick so that was nice and we weren't concerned with getting plates for our appetizer anymore. The burger itself was good but the bun was super mediocre and thin so I wasn't impressed with that. BUT the worst part of it all was our waitress. She didn't have even the slightest smile on her face, was super impatient with me when I couldn't decide which beer to get at first, and rushed us through our meal when there were only two parties in line. I totally get that's what restaurants need to do when they're busy but uhhhh they weren't busy at all so why be so rude about it? Especially when there are 2 or 3 empty tables around us. I'm glad I tried it but I probably won't be going back!",

I like the bread they use. I requested crispy bacon and they did not disappoint. I believe there were 3 slices of bacon too, a lot of places skimp and only give you two. My only gripe was the white cheddar cheese I got was bland...I might request an extra slice next time.  The fries were nothing to write home about, and not really worth $4 extra IMO. I'll try the onion rings next time. I got a salted caramel (non-alc) milkshake and it was pretty amazing (thanks to Dave & Andy's ice cream) and plenty big enough to share. Our service was very friendly. The decor is great.  My only major dislike of the place is that they say no substitutions or additions to their burgers. The recipes all sound great, but I'm a rather picky person. My husband had the Shrooms burger, but he thinks it would be great with blue cheese instead of brie. Well, no can do. There's nothing wrong with having unique recipes that you don't want to mess with, but I think if you're going to do that you should also have an a la carte, build your own burger option.  I likely won't come back again on a Sunday afternoon though because there were way too many kids in here. Why do people bring their kids here? Come on, it's expensive. Go to Applebee's or something so we adults can enjoy a nice adult atmosphere. Good grief.",

There were enough toppings to keep things interesting, but it was still very manageable to eat without making a mess of myself and the table.  We split the Parmesan fries which I'm mixed on. The fries themselves were perfectly prepared, but the Parmesan? Just a few shavings over the top, not even melted.  Slight fry disappointment aside, I will be returning to BRGR for sure.",

Good vibe to the place -young crowd and families. Seats are a little close to other diners. Dinner included Root Float, o rings w truffled Cheese Whiz - I know, who thinks of these crazy concoctions - which was good and crispy but needs a little larger onion. Had the Fire in the Hole burger med rare (very pink center) and it was really good. GF had the Button Buster w the short ribs and white cheddar but we could not locate any cheese - serious bummer. They do iphone paging system so you can check your progress! Overall nice experience. Ladies room was clean and big.",

I got the Button Buster and my dinning partner got the Kobe Beef burger.  We requested it medium and medium rare, respectively, and they came out right on point.  Nicely done, brgr.  The best thing about these burgers were the buns.  They did not come out soggy (looks like someone rested their meat before plating!  Yes!), which is a huge bonus in my book.  Soggy buns are disgusting.  Their buns also withstood the manhandling they had to endure while being devoured.  Another huge bonus for not falling apart.  The shoestring fries weren't the best fries I've ever had, but they were plenty better than school cafeteria fries.  :p  We also got the daily special milkshake which was vanilla peanut butter.  It was amazing!  Probably one of the better milkshakes I've had in my time.",

    "text": "I personally love Brgr!  The 'adult' shakes are always a good way to start or end a meal.  I have been there multiple times and have tried almost everything on the menu.  I do have a few favorites:  Gobble-Gobble burger; which is like eating thanksgiving in a burger.  The combination of the turkey burger, stuffing patty, pickled green beans and the cranberry sauce, make a perfect burger that doesn't leave you feeling to stuffed and is great cold!  Amore burger: is a beef and pork burger kinda like a meatball and topped with marinara sauce and two fried mozzarella sticks.  It sounds like a fatty burger but it fills the body with happiness.  I love their skinny fries which come in a basket big enough to share with at least 4 people.    Their onion rings are perfect and taste great with their brgr sauce.  There is normally a wait on weekend nights but it is open from lunch to dinner so if you're in the mood for an early dinner I say GO For it!!  Great place with friendly staff.  I love this place, and I love it more since its walking distance to my house :)",

Immediately we were greeted and our waitress rocked. Didn't leave us hanging, checked in on us periodically and didn't dilly dally.  My boyfriend ordered the turkey burger and I ordered the fire in the hole burger along with a side of the parmesian fries. I ordered mine medium rare which looked more medium so there was enough juice. The peppers and the guacamole added nice flavor though the meat itself was bland so those fixings carried the burger. Nice buns! The fries were good though a little over done.",

The meat is always cooked the right way i want it to be, shakes are to die for (I don't like vanilla and my boyfriend got the vanilla milkshake-I loved it!!!) and of course the fries and onion rings as well are SO GOOD. If you just add on beer, the best burger joint you have right there! Definitely recommnd BRGR to anyone and the menu is not too long, not too short so i'ts perfect to just put in your order and chit chat w/ your friends as you drink your beer. I visit Pittsburgh about once a month for the weekend, and I've been to BRGR all times for the past 3 visits. It's just inevitable:)",

I've noticed a trend with this place and Burgatory where there is a lot of talk about the fanciful and impressive burgers, but what I want with a burger is just delicious food.  Don't get me wrong-- I enjoy fussy burgers with lots of various toppings, but the actual beef has to good.  Both times I've order burgers here, I've asked for medium-rare, and every time it comes out well-done.  The fries the first time were delicious, but the second time I came here, they were lukewarm, over-salted, and dry as if they'd been sitting under a heat lamp for too long.  I think the two things that make BRGR a worthwhile trip are the alcoholic milkshakes and the rooftap terrace (only open in the Spring and Summer, I believe).  I doubt I'll ever get food here again, but if some friends want to relax under the sun/stars and get fat/drunk on some shakes, I'd suggest BRGR.    Random sidenote - did BRGR really pay for the rights to play the Rolling Stones song \"Gimme Shelter\" on their website?  I'm skeptical.",

    "text": "Burger wars!! Let's dive in to the battle eh.  Brgr has a nice ambiance to it; casual, sophisticated but not too pretentious. TV's spaced out so you can catch a game; they even had Fox Soccer  Channel on!  There's upstairs outdoor seating but it seems to fill up pretty quickly. I came here on a random weeknight and we were able to get seating for two without a wait.  Service is a little slow and the server forgot to bring out my drink until we were halfway through the burgers. There's a pretty broad selection of burgers and I wish I had gotten something more exotic. Both of us got the kobe beef burger, which was cooked nicely (I prefer a medium for burgers). It had a nice crunch and the bun held up. The fries were good and the cheez whiz sauce was delicious! I don't know what they did to the ol' standby cheez whiz but it was excellent.  Overall, I don't know that Brgr does anything to truly distinguish itself. I'll be more than happy to come back and try it again but in one sitting, the fare didn't impress me the way Wingharts and Tessaro's instantly did. (Note to self to try the milkshakes next time as that might up the star rating by one if as good as reviewed on Yelp).  In the Pittsburgh burger wars betwixt Brgr, Tessaro's, Wingharts, I think Brgr comes in third. No shame in losing out to those two joints as Brgr does produce a decent quality burger anyway.",

    "text": "February Burger of the Month Club! (Road edition)  Last meal from a great weekend included a trip to BRGR. One thing that I must say is that PIttsburgh has great bread. Sandwiches, buns, pastries...all have been fresh and tasted EXCELLENT.   To drink..Spiked Milkshake. My choice? Salted Caramel! (Bourbon, caramel sauce, sea salt and vanilla bean ice cream) I was worried the bourbon may over power but when the tall steel cup came out with the large straw, I was thoroughly impressed. (Note, try spiked milkshakes more often.) It wasn't too thick to enjoy and surprisingly, I didn't feel like I was on a sugar rush afterwards.   To eat....Cease and Desist burger (American cheese, carmelized onions, thousand island dressing) and for a shared side...Housemade chips and dip.  As I said earlier, bread in Pittsburgh has really impressed me. (random, I know.) But with the wheat bun on the Cease and Desist I was transported to burger heaven. The caramelized onions were a perfect shade of brown and the sauce and cheese did not overpower anything. BRGR cooks burgers to order and had great descriptions on the menu so you don't order incorrectly and my medium was definitely the perfect medium. The housemade chips and dip were tasty too. The dip is their own concoction that reminded me of nachos. Cheesy, a few black beans and some ground beef. I could've done without the meat in it because it was a giant clump, but I simply ate around it.   The prices were closer to DC prices I pay back here at home but it was definitely a great lunch. Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I come to BRGR a fair bit, as I live right around the corner. It's not the best burger in Pittsburgh, nor is it the cheapest, but it's still damn good.  My go-to burger here is the Button Buster cooked medium. Braised short ribs and a fried onion ring on a burger? Yes, please! I haven't tried many of their other beef burger options, besides the Shrooms burger (which is decent, but is no Button Buster).  For those not into beef, their pork, salmon, and turkey burger options are also excellent. The turkey burger, topped with their take on stuffing, cranberry sauce, and green beans, is literally Thanksgiving condensed into one delicious bite.  BRGR's sides are all excellent and the portions are definitely large enough to be shared; I've never been able to finish a basket of fries by myself. As good as their fries are though, my favorite side has to be the fried pickles. You get four large, golden-brown spears accompanied by their excellent housemade ranch dressing.  Finally, their beer and drink selection is excellent. I'm mostly a beer and cocktail person, so I can't comment on their popular spiked milkshakes. However, they always have a dozen or so beers on tap, with a cider thrown in there too usually. The taps rotate very frequently, which is nice. For those into whiskey and/or cider, one of my favorite drinks on the menu is one of their \"deconstructed cocktails,\" the Faded Pig. It's a shot of bacon-infused Jack Daniels, followed by a shot of balsamic onion brine, finished with a can of Jack's cider. It may sound a bit weird, but it's such a great flavor combination.",

My boyfriend and i went out on a date here and paid $30 for food and about $30 in drinks and we only ordered a total of three all together (two special drinks, one beer).

I worked in the industry for a loooong time and know what fails a place.   I hope the owners are paying attention.  You've got a good product and a nice physical space, but the front-house team needs something: encouragement, leadership, a system, all-of-the-above.  I felt bad tipping 12%, but it was warranted and probably too high.    Note to owners:  PLEASE do NOT blame the front house staff.  Blame only yourselves and fix it with compassion.

I like not having to stick within 10 feet of the host, especially in a crowded space like Brgr. 2. Spiked Milkshakes. Seriously, this was pretty much the only redeeming factor. These things are the bomb-diggity. Salted Caramel and The Dude (think White Russian) are to die for. Prepare for multiple brain freezes. 3. They can cook meat to the requested temperature. Sadly, this can be a rare quality, and Brgr nailed a Med Rare, Med, and a Med Well. 4. The fries were good, and the truffle cheese whiz was OK.  Cons: 1. Our server sucked. I won't go into the details, but she was a space cadet. 2. The fried pickles are spears, and they're nothing to write home about. Especially since they're, like, $1/spear. 3. My Kobe burger was just OK. Honestly, I took 2 bites, and was done.  I didn't get onions on mine since another burger at the table requested no onions, and there was barely any bleu cheese. The whole thing was dry. 4. It's expensive.  I'll try you again, BRGR, and hopefully we can go up a star or two next visit.",

All in all, the food was good tasting and flavorful. Unfortunately their service was pretty bad. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table when within our sight there were 3 available 4-person tables. When we asked about it we were told they liked to save those tables in case larger parties came in and need to be seated. We were appalled and almost left. We had to wait so they could accommodate people that may or may not show up after us to get seated BEFORE us. Our server was very unfriendly and not at all interested in answering our questions. The Average Joe burger was completely different from how we ordered it. And we had to ask to have our water filled from the hostess because we asked our server three times for more water and she just kept forgetting and going to talk with her coworkers. Would've given this review one star but the food was actually good although I probably won't go back until they've turned over the staff.",

The cease and desist burger was initially called the Double-Double after the famous In-N-Out burger but they got a letter from their lawyers asking them to cease and desist. Viola. They are usually spot on with burger temps and even if they go over the burger is still juicy and enjoyable. The Mrs. always gets the salted caramel spiked shake(Jim Beam) and it is delicious. I love that they have Coke products because frankly Pepsi sucks. Nice comfy atmosphere and the service is good as well. French fries are the thin kid which I like and the fried pickles and Cajun tater tots are snacky sides to get. It's reasonably priced and there are lots of tv's if there is a game on you want to watch.  8.5 of 10 stars",

Bun, pickle, and toppings are so-so; if you're not quick, the bun disintegrates into a sloppy mess. Not that a burger place would be ideal for vegetarians, but the veggie burger is decent. It's best described as spicy falafel with some black beans sprinkled in. Overall, a pretty good experience.  Service and food prices were good. Beer prices were a little steep.

    "text": "Perhaps I expect too much from an exclusively burger joint, but I was deeply disappointed by my experience.  While Brgr is purely a burger restaurant they had a mere 5 burger options! WTF? And no 'build your own burger option!  The menu was rounded out by such dubious choices as tuna steak, falafel burger, or turkey burger, as well as a slew of salads.  Really? The place is called burger, just stick to one thing!  At any rate, they offer 4 or so burgers, none of which sound nor tasted good.  My 'medium' burger was virtually rare, cold center that was purple and a barely seared outside.  I ate the thing so fast just to get the ordeal over with.  The rest of the table did the same.  It was curious that 3 us ate there and said nothing about the food til we went to a bar afterwards and everyone admitted that they hated it, but wasn't willing to say so at the restaurant to destroy the evening.   Also for sides, you have to pay $4 or so for fries or onion rings and what not.  Those were all okay, but nothing amazing. And the beer selection was very good, a standard 10 or so beers w/a good mix of local and national micros.   Overall, I'll never return.  The burgers were subpar and the prices, while not super high, aren't worth such mediocrity.  Sadly, w/fries and a burger you're paying $16-20 for a very average meal.  Add to it the lame atmosphere which includes far too many remnants from the space's former owners.  Stay away!",

First the good on the burger; the buns are amazing, toasted to perfection, and the ingredients are clearly fresh. What fell flat then? I mid-rare burger without a trace a pink, and lack of creativity, and more importantly texture and zip in the toppings.  I will indeed be back for their post 10pm specials which include a cheap average Joe burger and deals on their wonderfully creative ice-cream and liquor cocktails. I also want to try the lamb burger.

She had been there before but I was dying to check it out after hearing every single one of my friends rave about it!

My girlfriend ordered the Shrooms Burger ($10).. the brie on it was amazing and for an extra charge she asked for arugula .... I was quite envious!   Not sure if our waiter was really busy or just good at reading tables because he didn't come around that often.. but we liked that because we were catching up for the entire 2 hours we were there!

Not that the newer menu isn't better ... there is a lot more variety on it in terms of the kind of burgers you can get and they added some flair to the appetizer menu. The one thing that really made this place stand out was the fact that they used to have half-off on the Average Joe burger after 10 PM. $4 for a premium burger that is customizable fixings for $1 each is simply such a steal ... that just doesn't exist anymore. The new menu is nice though ... appetizers are good and them milkshakes are always nice to have.",

They also served their special crack dip ( it's a chili-esque, thin dip) served with tortillas. My favorite part was the potato salad. It's filled with fresh dill, and absolutely delish! The only improvement I would suggest is that they don't have capabilites to have a full bar upstairs. Soooo, they had to climb up and down the stairs to get drinks and it took forever....",

I debated between a 3 or 4 star review but when I consider the fact that I've been back for more on more than two occasions, I had to go higher with my rating.  I can't really hate a place that has tater tots and the Cajun Tater Tots at BRGR are well seasoned and very crispy.  I like homemade chips and I've had their crack dip.  It's good, but I don't get the hype.  I've haven't yet tried any of the spiked shakes.  When I do a burger and shake, I usually go with boring vanilla.    I have enjoyed the Average Joe, Cease and Desist, Fire in the Hole and Button Buster.  Each burger is tasty and exciting in its own way.  The Average Joe is a good way to go at BRGR if you're looking to start simple.  Fire in the Hole has all your hotter ingredients (pepper jack cheese, jalepenos, sriracha sauce).  Cease and Desist is a good combination that's not too filling (cheese, caramelized onions and thousand island dressing) while the Button Buster is stacked high with short ribs, cheese and crispy onions.  I might have considered that 5th star if the burgers were cooked consistently.  My usual request is medium and I've had a few burgers more medium well or well done.  While I've only gone with their beef burgers, they do offer seafood, poultry and veggie burger creations as well.    BRGR occupies an open and inviting space in East Liberty.  Great place for some people watching while you enjoy a burger and fries.",

Anyway, I moved into the neighborhood and decided to give it a try.  The waitress was a little new and was a little hesitant with my gluten free status.  Whatever it was fine.  I ended up ordering a bison burger on a gluten free bun with cucumber and smoked cheddar with a side of coleslaw.  First let me say the side of coleslaw was enormous and looked amazing.  As for the bison burger... well the burger itself was a bit bland and a bit dry.  That being said the added toppings on the burger and the gluten free bun made everything much better.   Also, there is an upstairs and it is worth it.  The view is pretty good and it is nice and breezy.  Overall, the waiters are nice and the food ok.  I will, however, agree that if you want an excellent burger maybe try Burgatory.  BRGR is really about the location and atmosphere.",

I'm happy to say that BRGR is a solid burger joint.  We started off with a salted caramel and vanilla milkshake spiked with bourbon. The flavor combination works, but I almost wanted a separate vanilla milkshake and the bourbon on the rocks in another glass. We wanted to try both The BRGR and the Smokehouse Bison burger, so we ordered both and they cut the burger in half for us so we could each try a bit of the other. That was nice of them.   The BRGR was eh, kinda just a normal burger. The Smokehouse Bison was awesome. Juicy, spicy, and the chipotle aioli worked really well the rest of the toppings. We also got fries with parmesan and herbs and the \"truffle cheese whiz.\" The server assured us that it was actual cheese whiz mixed with truffle oil, but a housemade blend of cheese and truffle oil. It was awesome. If I go back, I'll definitely order those fries again.",

We were seated right away at the table of our choosing. Waitress came up to us very quickly, and was smiling and sincere. We ordered drinks and fries to start, and they came very quickly. The fries! So fresh, with a perfect amount of parm and herbs. I got a sly fox pils, it was very refreshing. My mahi mahi (Maui wowie on menu) burger was obviously freshly made, not a frozen pattie. I had it on the lettuce wrap, which actually worked well! My friend had the shroom burger, and she said it was great... It must have been because she never finishes anything and there was only a bit left!  All in all, extremely pleased with the great lunch, atmosphere and service.",

They do give you a pretty sizable helping of fresh cooked fries when you order them, and every ingredient on the burger is fresh. It's the kind of meal I don't think I'd typically pay $10-15 for, but I enjoyed it and didn't feel bad about it. Plus the staff here were all super cool and friendly. I can think of worse places to go get a gourmet burger and a drink or two.",

I loved the taste of the onion with the foie gras and crunchy greens.  It was delightful. The Greek salad was you standard preparation; tasty, fresh and crispy. I have to commend service here by saying; I mentioned that we were going to share everything and they brought our food to us in 1/2 portions so we did not have to cut and separate everything ourselves.  This extra step was a pleasant surprise and our server was helpful and friendly.   I would totally come back here to try more off their menu.  Prices were affordable, service was very good and the food was delicious.  Oh and they have a full bar with drink specials.",

Pros: Cool atmosphere and vibe, generous portions (if that's a good thing- not sure), crispy fries and friendly staff. Choose a more interesting burger- the braised rib burger, one with caramelized onions, and an interesting dressing or cheese makes for a yummy experience. (ie. what my husband orders)  Cons: If you like a juicy burger, you have to order the burger medium rare.  Medium doesn't have any pink color and all the juices are gone.  This has been tested a couple of times, so not just my bad luck.   The basic cheeseburger is bland, especially if the burger is overcooked.

    "text": "Food: *Disclaimer: all food comments come from a vegetarian perspective*  BRGR serves exactly what you would expect, burgers.  And thats pretty much it.  They have two salad options, neither of which look exciting, a few sides like chili, and french fries.  There are 10+ burger options, all of which can be made with veggie burgers, and 2-3 hot dog options, which can't be made veggie friendly.  The burgers range from sweet (carmelized onions), to spicy (jalapenos), to mexican (guac), to BBQ style (apple wood bacon), and more.  The veggie burger is huge and comprised of mostly falafel with some corn sprinkled in, but lacks flavor.  Other restaurants in the city make homemade veggie burgers, and this one doesn't rate in the top 10, or even close.  The descriptions of the burgers sound considerably better than they actually taste; nothing has blown us away in multiple visits trying multiple items.  Even the unusual condiments on every table are skimpy on flavor.  The fries are enough to share, and are above average but not spectacular.  Wheat buns and gluten-free options are available.  The non-veggie burgers include beef, turkey, and even seafood.  Carnivorous friends have been satisfied, but not amazed.  Price: Burgers range from $7-12 and sides from $3-6.  The burgers are very big, so you'll definitely get your fill.  The fries are meant for a group, so at $4, you get a pretty decent amount.  Cocktails range from $6-10, but are worthwhile (see below).  There are late night specials that include burgers and Pabst Blue Ribbon, which is definitely a plus.   Drinks: You would think hamburgers would be what a place named BRGR does best, but, if you thought that, you would be wrong.  BRGR's bar is fantastic, with a large and diverse beer selection, unique cocktails and liquor choices, and bartenders who know how to make the drinks well.  There aren't many restaurants in Pittsburgh I would say this about, but it is worth going to BRGR just to drink.  The cocktails aren't cheap, but they're large, interesting, and stiff.  There are seasonal specials, and BRGR also offers spiked milkshakes, all of which sound incredible.  Atmosphere: The downstairs and upstairs rooms at BRGR both have great atmosphere, a True strength of the East Liberty location.  Downstairs, there is a garage door in the front which opens to the the sidewalk and street and allows sunlight and fresh air in.  The bar is big and is a good place to hang out until your table is ready.  Upstairs is even better.  In front, you can look out over Centre. Ave., and from behind, you have a beautiful view of gothic East Liberty architecture, which looks beautiful as the sun sets.    Service: The service has always been attentive, helpful, and friendly over the course of multiple visits to BRGR.  The bartenders know what they're doing and are more than willing to carry on a conversation if you're alone.  BRGR provides Valet parking at a $3 charge plus gratuity, which may be necessary on a Friday night.    (+): great drinks, solid service, and truly nice atmosphere  (-): overall, the food is average at best  Would I go back again? For drinks, absolutely, and after 5-6 of them, I may be convinced to try another burger.",

    "text": "My first experience dining at BRGR was for a girls' night...because, evidently, when it comes to my friends and I, \"girls' night\" means \"chow down on burgers, beer, and milkshakes\"...the picture of femininity and grace. I've been there many times since, happily introducing my family and a handful of friends to this fun little burger place, and it's definitely at the top of my list for \"best burger joint.\"  With a trendy indoor dining and bar area and fantastic little outdoor section (located upstairs, with a view of...well, the street...but still nice), this place is perfect any time of year (the upper area is open even in the wintertime, thanks to a generous collection of heating units and patio torches). If you're not looking for a burger, you should avoid it, because that's about all you're going to find on their menu (aside from a salad or two and a selection of fattening but oh-so-delicious sides). This place is called BRGR (supposed to kind of look like and sound like \"burger,\" I believe) for a reason: they offer burgers; handcrafted, sloppy, delicious burgers. On top of traditional beef patties (topped with ingredients that actually make them far from traditional), the restaurant also offers a selection of nontraditional burgers (tuna, turkey, vegetarian, salmon, and more, depending on the season and the chef's changing interests). Some burgers, like the kobe beef burger, are pretty much always available, while others come and go throughout the year (my favorite disappearing burger was an amazing lamb burger with Greek cheese, cucumber, and other Mediterranean-ish ingredients). The \"Average Joe\" is about as basic as you get, but I recommend you travel outside your comfort zone and try one of their other delicious, handcrafted creations: \"Fire in the Hole\" (with jalapenos and sriracha, for those who like a little heat), \"California Lovin'\" (a  turkey burger that will make you rethink the whole concept of turkey--it's not just for Thanksgiving and school lunch sandwiches anymore), \"Kamikazi\" (the best sushi ever, but burger-style), and \"Kobe Beef\" (featuring bleu cheese, oven-roasted tomatoes, and other deliciousness). Be sure to add a side of fries with truffle cheese whiz (this is not your average cheese out of a can--it's a creamy cheese sauce blended with truffle oil), or perhaps the house-made chips (served with \"crack dip,\" an amazing concoction that should come with all chips ever). If you have a dessert stomach, like me, or if you simply plan ahead and don't stuff yourself, save room for one of their spiked milkshakes. \"Salty Caramel\"--made with vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce, sea salt, and bourbon--is phenomenal. \"Cupajoe\" is great for coffee and chocolate lovers alike, and non-alcoholic shakes are available for the kiddos. Aside from all of this, they have a pretty good beer selection and offer mixed drinks too.  This is a fun place to head to with friends, or visit for a casual date night, and it's in a great location (near lots of shopping and a few other restaurants). Parking can be a bit tricky (you can't park in the garage across the street, because it's reserved for shoppers at that shopping \"mall\" area), and the area a few blocks over is a wee bit sketchy, but neither of these things are major issues.  So, if you've got a hankering for a burger, skip the craptastic offerings at your local fast food joint and head to BRGR. Just make sure to come on an empty stomach. And don't forget about the truffle cheese whiz. It makes everything better. Everything.",

First off, the menu was totally unimpressive.  I eat fish and no other meats, and was sorely disappointed to see so few options for me.  My fiancee eats meat and was equally disappointed.  I got the lentil falafel burger, and it was so unevenly done.  Exterior was burnt/crunchy and the insides were lukewarm.  No flavor whatsoever.  Her meal was the BLT salad....which was basically a half-head of iceberg lettuce and not much else.    It wasnt expensive....but for what we got, it was a rip off.  I could have had just as much satisfaction with a veggie burger out of a box from the grocery store.    They offer no \"build your own\" menu like Burgatory, and none of the seasoning/condiments/toppings of Burgatory.  This menu was completely boring.  Oh......and we were given plastic forks and knives.....seriously?  This place is awful....no chance i'm going back.",

    "text": "Three words - I loved it! I loved the vibrant atmosphere, filled with burgers and fries and tall tumblers of shakes with ambient lighting and customers of all ages and kinds of groups. The food is delicious! I got a shroomz (mushroom, brie, some kind of mustard dressing) and my companion got the kind with guacamole and jalapenos. The fries are crisp (pretty close to pomme frites) and sprinkled with herbs and parmesan.   I am not sure what is there not to like about BRGR! I think the place adds awesome and much needed twist to Pittsburgh's American cuisine. Well if you do not like guacamole on your burger, then may be this place is not for you. However, if you appreciate the line of contemporary resturants like Avenue B, Salt, Elements, etc. go to BRGR and enjoy!   Oh for those non-Shadysiders, parking is free in the covered lot by Fedex, Plum, Borders, etc. Don't go to the paid lot on the other side on Highland. Also it gets really busy, so go on a weekday if you can. Otherwise, totally worth the wait.",

I ordered the P450 (or something) with grapefruit, and I didn't like it. It tasted... funky. I also ordered the Little Bloody, which was fun to drink. A shot of tequila, a shot of spicy tomato juice, and a can of Tecate. I felt pretty damn cool.   Service was good, considering my group was getting a bit drunk and rowdy.   Fried pickles were delicious, and they were my favorite order of the night. I almost ditched my burger to order another round of pickles, but I'm glad I didn't. My burger was good. Grilled cheese bites were nothing special.   Conclusion? Get the Dark & Stormy and Fried Pickles. You're welcome.",

    "text": "Alright, upon returning to BRGR after my not-so-good experience last year, I found myself hoping for a better time.  Well, I got my wish!  BRGR competes bigtime with the other burger joints in the area.  My burger, the Button Buster, was absolutely delicious.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare, just as I asked for.  You can tell that BRGR puts extra care in their meat.  One can taste the difference in the quality and preparation of the meat at first bite.  The toppings were great on my burger, and unlike last time, I did not feel jipped at all when it came to packedness factor (the amount of toppings they pack onto the burger).  Still, my one complaint is you have to pay extra for sides.  Just give me a side of chips, and charger me an extra buck.  I would rather have that then to pay a la carte for a side.  Also, gimme some more non-alcoholic milkshake options.  If they'd do this, they would easily be competing for the spot in my heart as the best burger in Pittsburgh.  All-in-all, it was a great meal.  I will definitely be coming back and bringing my family.  They deserve to have their minds updated and refreshed on what BRGR brings to the table.",

The wait staff was very polite and chatty as can be.  Attentive to our needs and always coming back around to refill our drinks.  The food was delicious.  I opted for the California Lovin', I was craving and in need of a turkey burger and it hit the spot.  The pesto mayo and alfalfa sprouts was quite the nice mixture.  On a wheat bun was a great choice as well.  My only downside here is that I was unaware that a burger only came with a pickle as a side.  I was kind of expecting to receive chips or fries as a side, but just a plain old dill pickle.  Next time I'll be sure to add a side or get an appetizer to start.",

I'm a big fan of the salty caramel milkshake with bourbon, and the fried pickles are really good, but everything else that I've ever tried has always fallen flat, from the ahi burger...to a regular burger...to the sante fe hippie veggie burger. I've tried REALLY hard to be impressed, but it's just not happening. The buns are dry, the burgers are overpriced, and the flavors are simply lacking the interest to justify going back. If I'm paying a premium price for an a la carte burger, there are better establishments in Pittsburgh to choose from.  Not to mention, the beer prices at BRGR are laughable. $7 for a Strongbow bottle? You've got to be kidding me. I guess they've got to get all the money out of you during your visit since the food isn't going to be bringing you back.",

But the service has always been quick and friendly here from the servers and bartenders. The shakes are good, but I usually order one of the well-priced craft beers (they have a great selection) or a deconstructed cocktail.  My favourite is probably the deconstructed tequila cocktail - a shot of tequila with a chaser of sangrita (yes!!!) followed with a can of tecate for $7. My boyfriend got the pickle back - a shot of whiskey with a pickle juice chaser followed by a PBR for $6. Nice! I think these are really fun.  The crack dip is good, but the truffle cheese wiz is even way better. That's the dip that brings me back for serious bar snacks. Yum!",

It was A comedy of errors from beginning to end. the worst service I think I have ever gotten anywhere.  I sat for 10 minutes before the waitress came and brought me water. QI had to ask for her to take my order. When my meal came somebody else brought it it was the wrong order and over cooked.  After several minutes of sitting alone with it I began to eat the part I was not allergic to   after a timethe waitress came to check on me (mid bite). I alerted her to the situation but as I was needing a quick bite to get onto the next thing I decided not to send it back but asked for A plate to separate the food I could eat out    the plate never came   I ended up taking it home for my dog-   another 10 minutes sitting with my forks forks down before she came by and I could ask her for a to go box. (Biodegradable). Then had to ask her 10 minutes later for my check.   I am lucky to live in Pittsburgh that gives me the option of finding real local food elsewhere",

After that 45 minutes passed and I noticed the delivery time had changed to another half hour later, I called Grubhub customer service. They said they would contact the driver, then said it would be another 10 minutes. Once again, the ETA had been changed. But it wasn't 10 minutes later, but another 20 minutes!!! And the driver didn't even get here within that time frame! It was at least another 30 minutes that I had to wait before my food FINALLY arrived!!! And the driver was rude and just handed the bag to us without any pleasantries, apologies or anything!! I'm so mad I tipped on my card prior to receiving my order. I want my TIP BACK!! And my money back!! Horrible service and the sandwich wasn't even good. I ordered the Cod Burger and there was Barely any fish on the sandwich. And of course by the time I got the food it was cold. So I had to warm it up in the oven, which meant more time that I had to wait before I could even eat it!!!! And all grubhub customer service wanted to do for my 'inconvenience' is offer me $10 off my next order.  How about refund me for this current terrible order because I surely don't want to use y'all again and won't be ordering from BRGR again. I'm not sure if the hold up was from the restaurant or the driver but either way it was terrible service.",

The service is nice when the waitress is at your table, but for a place that wasn't so busy, I'd say it was a little spotty.  What was exceptional, however, was that when we ordered our Salted Caramel (spiked with Bourbon) shake and said we'd share it, the waitress automatically brought it out in two glasses, which was thoughtful.   In terms of the burgers though...My friend and I got a Shrooms  (mushrooms, brie, caramelized onion) burger and a Double Yoi (pastrami, egg, swiss cheese, slaw) to share.  The burgers are super oily and unfortunately, the beef patties seemed so sadly underseasoned.  It was so so so underseasoned that the burger probably would've been just as good without the patties.  Sad.  The Shrooms came out on top though- the Double Yoi ended up being really heavy, even with the slaw.  I liked the ideas behind the burgers, but felt that the execution wasn't so great.   The fries are pretty bomb though, so if you come, get some for the table to share.",

I can make a better burger on my own at home (and one that would be more healthy), I will say though that the homemade chips are yummy and they have a lot of good milkshakes.    The staff can use some help in terms of their attitudes as well... what ever happened to service with a smile?  It definitely did not exist on this most recent visit to BRGR.

It's a bit out of my way and parking can be tricky in this part of town, which is the only reason I haven't gone back.   So, most importantly, the food. BRGR definitely has some fantastic options. I love their cheesy toasted grilled cheese bites and would so order these again. And the burgers! I'm seriously in love with their burgers. I read their menu and zeroed in on the fact that they have a Brie cheese 'shroom burger. I'm all about delicious, cheese-loaded 'shroom burgers - particularly big juicy ones ones that you can order local ales with. Plus, I went to dine here during the summer, so I had the chance to sit by the wide open floor-to-ceiling windows. I had a perfect dinner, and it was the perfect atmosphere for dinner.  Be careful if you choose this seating option, though; I went during the end of rush hour so it wasn't a big deal, but the music combined with car horns could easily have been pretty hard on the ears. Not to mention, near the end of my meal it began raining before anyone could shut those windows, which I'm sure could have negatively affected my meal if I'd arrived later in the evening and sat in the same place. It probably wouldn't hurt for the staff to double check weather forecasts before opening those enormous windows, especially on a busy night where guests can't exercise caution and ask to sit anywhere else.  Last note: looking at other reviews, I wonder if this place is hit or miss depending on the day you go, because my burger was perfect and my fries just excellent. I'll have to see what happens when I get the chance to eat here again!",

I ordered a burger for 10$, but that does not come with sides.The food came out very quick; which isn't always a good thing because I go out so that I can sit and relax for a little while, not just eat and get the hell out the door! The burger wasn't bad, but certainly nothing special, and definitely not worth the price. The beef was cooked well, but I dont think they used any seasoning, the cheese tasted like cheap flavorless cheese. Of note; neither the fries or onion rings are homemade :(  The place is ok, but doesn't live up to it's name BRGR. I was expecting a damn good burger!  BURGATORY is much much much better. The food is better, sides are homemade, and the selection of burgers is way bigger and they have a 'make your own burger' menu.",

We ordered and split one of the adult milkshakes and it was amazing.  I now believe that no vanilla ice cream should be served without bourbon.  I had the button buster which was delicious and rich, my husband had the smokehouse bison which would be my choice for our next visit.  We shared an order of fries which were tasty.    All in all, it was a very good experience.  Only 4 stars because our waitress was too busy socializing to give us the caliber of service I have come to expect with any restaurant, but especially for a restaurant with what appeared to be an abundance of wait staff for a relatively slimly populated dining room.  We would certainly return.",

The braised short ribs on top of the burger were quite fatty and unappetizing. I took off the remaining short ribs and finished more of the burger. I wish that it would have come with a side as well. Overall, if I go here again I will definitely get a different burger.",

It pleases the meat lover and vegetarian alike.  I have had the \"Tree Hugger\" burger:  lentil + falafel burger, hot + sour cucumbers, tomato, red onion,goat's milk yogurt  - it is so delicious that I feel guilty about eating a veggie burger!  I have also tried the \"Love You Long Time\" burger  - 5 oz Ahi tuna patty, avocado +wasabi puree, pickled cucumbers + daikon radish, chili aioli, sweet soy sauce -- since this is sushi grade tuna, i simply had it seared and it was AWESOME!  My boyfriend is a huge fan of the meat burgers... and we always get the fried pickles to share.  The salted caramel spiked shake is awesome and they have a great selection of beers too!",

Give me a choice of bread for the price you're charging! The menu could have been a little more innovative; to say the least; I think they're playing it safe like so many restaurants around here do. As it turns out, BRGR is also the name of a restaurant chain in New York, but unlike the Brgr in Pittsburgh, which says nothing about organic and grass-fed on their web-site, New York's BRGR only uses grass-fed and organic AND the prices are the same if not less expensive. The sad thing is, this restaurant will probably do well because most Pittsburghers naively accept over-priced mediocre food being disguised as something high end and special. Just look at Nakama.",

    "text": "First of all, let me say I rarely eat red meat.  I'm more of a chicken/turkey/seafood kind of gal.  This was my third time to Brgr, and I had previously tried the Salmon Burger (just so-so) and the Tree Hugger (lentil & falafel - not too fulfilling). This time, however, I decided to take the plunge and try an actual BURGER.  So I went with the Shrooms burger, topped with forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, brie cheese and mustard aioli.  I ordered it medium-well, and it was prepared accordingly.  For me, a person who eats red meat only a couple times per year, the burger wasn't mindblowingly, extraordinarily outstanding.  It was tasty, but I wasn't rocked to my core. The mustard aioli was pretty yummy, though...unfortunately, I couldn't really taste the brie.  My friend ordered the Double Yoi Burger, which came with pastrami, Swiss cheese, fried egg, cole slaw, and Thousand Island dressing. He moaned and raved his way through the thing - definitely sounds of pleasure and satisfaction. I was happy because it was his first time to Brgr, and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  We also shared an order of the fries (just with the parmesan and herbs), which were pretty standard (but nicely cooked), and a salty caramel milkshake (delish!).   So....from a culinary perspective, it was pretty good fare, though I have heard Burgatory blows it out of the water...  As for other factors, my friend and I had a short wait time, and our server was a very personable, patient, attentive 20-something woman who was very pleasant and helpful with our menu questions.    I would go back to Brgr - it's very convenient to my apartment, and I really want to try the Thai Pork & Shrimp Burger. :)",

I had the Oi Vey Burger which was fried egg, pastrami, cheese on the Burger. Wow.  The wait staff handle the huge rush of patrons really well. Our server was excellent despite the fact he had to big tables that all wanted separate checks (I hate that-embarrassing).  My only gripe this time is that the music was far too loud outside. We couldn't hear each other to have a conversation. The music was actually great, but too loud.",

    "text": "I really like the concept of Brgr and the menu sounds great on paper.  But Brgr is sort of like the new age pizza joint that is everywhere.  The toppings and menu are fantastic and the decor is nice, but they gloss over the most important thing: the basic foundation.  I ordered the \"Button Buster\" which is a burger topped with braised short ribs, white cheddar cheese, bearnaise, and \"crispy onions.\"  The crispy onions turned out to be house-made onion rings which was a pleasant surprise!  That's about the only good thing I can say about this burger.  The braised short ribs were rather tough and not flavorful at all.  The bread at this place is definitely not house-made, which is surprising considering that it's an up-scale burger joint, and is bad and dry.  The worst part?  The burger itself.  Three of us ordered med-rare burgers and ALL of them were WELL DONE.  I mean, c'mon, even Red Robin and Denny's can do better than that.  Could it have been a misplaced order?  Not likely considering the wooden toothpick skewering my dry, dry burger said \"MED RARE.\"  After my first bite, I lifted the bun so I could cut into the burger to check the center.  To my surprise, it looked like the cook had already done that, confirmed that it was to his/her liking, and still served it to us overcooked.  We also tried the spiked shakes which were quite tasty but that's a given with Dave and Andy's.  I wish there had been more milkshake like at a diner where a typical milkshake is really 3x the volume necessary.  I'm not sure if our burgers were a fluke as the restaurant was pretty busy for a Sunday evening.  So I'd suggest going to Brgr at a really off-hour, like maybe 3pm on a weekday, so that you have the kitchen's entire attention.  Or if you prefer well-done burgers, then this place may be okay for you.",

There were 4 of us - 2 of which were newbies and came on our recommendation.  All was good up until the very end.  We had paid our check and were sitting there chatting NO MORE THAN 5 minutes when our server informed us that they needed our table and requested that we leave.  Granted, we were offered a to-go milkshake but, in my opinion, that HARDLY makes up for the embarrassment and humiliation of being asked to leave a restaurant for ANY reason.  I would have certainly understood more if we had been sitting at our table for 20-30 minutes - but 5 minutes?  Really?  We will miss you BRGR - but I simply refuse to be treated that way no matter how busy you are.  And you weren't even all that busy.  Bottom-line - good burgers and food but they are more into turning tables over than making their customers feel valued or caring if they ever return.",

Mine was cooked--eh, it was close enough I didn't send it back but it was a bit overdone for medium rare (which is what I ordered).  And the stick in it said rare, which is proably just a simple error but could be a tip off they're not that serious about getting things cooked right.    I got the Average Joe: At a burger joint I want to taste the burger, not the flavor cover-ups and add ons.  But even a simple burger should come with good condiments and be well-dressed.  Lettuce: iceberg.  Tomato: overripe.  Onion: harsh white onion.  Condiments: French dressing and harsh yellow mustard or just average dijon.  In a place where you can put foie gras on your burger, you should be able to expect better than that.    Pickle: Fine, but it's a pickle after all.  Bun: a bit on the stale side.  Waitress: Gruff and slow.  Go to Tessaro's or Burgatory.",

    "text": "Went for my first try on a Sunday night. Sign is a bit hard to see, even right underneath it. It's he dark blue color, methinks. Two people, seated immediately. Nice and cozy with various comfy couches and tables and chairs. We had a bench seat/chair combo. Almost immediately we were asked if we'd mind moving to another table since a large party would be arriving shortly. No pressure at all - we were told we could stay put if we wanted. I had no issues with moving, and we soon relocated to a barstool-type table. It took a bit of time for a waitress to come over, but she finally arrived to take our drink order. Nice selection of draft and bottled beers, and good to see Natrona Bottling pops offered. I ordered a Shroomz Burger (forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, brie and mustard aoili) and my friend had a Fire in The Hole (guacamole, jalapenos, pepper jack and chipotle mayo). My burger was one of the tenderest I've had - almost too much so, like biting into cream cheese - but had decent flavor. My friend seemed to like his too. The only real issue I had was with the side of onion rings. They would have been wonderful - nice and crispy, tender onion circles, good-sized order - if it had retained at least a degree of warmth. My bad for not sending back. The fries were pretty much the same. When the bill came, the waitress told us our drinks were on the house for the inconvenience of having to move. That's class!  Overall, don't think there's anything in particular that would draw me back for super expensive burgers, but I wouldn't caution anyone to stay away. Just make sure to ask for your sides to be hot.",

    "text": "Forgive me for writing yet ANOTHER review so quickly after my last one, but I really gotta take BRGR down a star. I came here with my friend for his birthday and actually, this time, our service was pretty great, which was a nice surprise from last time. However, last time my burger was just a bit overcooked, and this time it was very overcooked (I always order rare). What happened here? The burgers used to be red and juicy and so good! The truffled cheese whiz hasn't tasted quite as truffley as usual these last two times either. And like I said previously, the fries are totally forgettable. So tragic! Get it together, BRGR!  And the kicker? After eating, we continued to chat for a while while I finished my sangria (which, albeit being basically just spiced wine, was pretty delicious). It was a Sunday and I guess they close early. Well, at about 9:45, maybe about 5 or 10 minutes after the last party before us left the restaurant, a man decked out in a suit whom I can only imagine to be the owner approached our table and said, direct quote, \"We're closing. You guys need to leave.\" and walked away. So rude. SO EFFING RUDE! No \"Thank you for dining with us,\" no \"Hope you enjoyed your meal,\" not even a casual \"Hey, just to let you guys know, we're closing in a few minutes.\" I've had bad waitresses, bad hostesses, but never in my life have I been treated this rudely by management! Oh yeah, and as we were saying our goodbyes outside the door, he popped his head out and looked us in the eye like an evil demon as he turned the lock on the door. WTF? Did he think we were going to try to get back in or something? It was totally creepy.  I don't know how I feel about this place now. I used to love coming here since it's a block away from my apartment, but now I'm kind of over it. I was always a bigger fan of BRGR than Burgatory, but I might be switching allegiances. Or I'll just go to Winghart's...why do I even bother with these other places again?",

I'm sorry but burgers are 100% about perfect proportioning of quality ingredients.  If you want to make a bigger bugger, make it bigger in a direction that makes sense.  Burgers are my favorite food, but I was not thrilled by this place.  Stack'd in shadyside is better for 1/4 the price.  Also the restaurant was freezing cold!  I was sat at a teeny high table where our plates could barely fit even though the restaurant was mostly empty.  I didn't like the way the burgers were served also, they were crammed in a tiny basket that made it hard to eat.  Don't get me wrong this place isn't bad, but there are so many other places nearby that will give you better food/atmosphere for a fraction of brgr price.",

I pick it up, take a bite and I feel something strange in my mouth. I feel it on my right side and pulled this strange thing out, I realized I had bitten into a large rubber band. I immediately called the waiter over and showed him what was in my sandwich. Took it away instantly and had a new one made for me.

We came around 530 on a Thursday and it was decently crowded in the restaurant area, but the bar wasn't- so we sat there :). Our bartender was friendly to us right Away and was very helpful in assisting me with figuring out what beer I wanted! I ordered four seasons bang bang double IPA, my boyfriend ordered helles lager by southern tier brewing. The happy hour special was that each beer was $2 off, which was pretty awesome! My beer was incredible and so was my boyfriends! I was really glad that the bartender suggested it for me!   After drinking a beer, I decided to try the grilled cheese bites for a small appetizer! They were a little pricey for what we received. The presentation demonstrated well how this appetizer isn't meal for more than two people and that it was basically grilled cheese on a stick. Having said that, it was incredibly tasty! The chipotle sauce on it was amazing and i loved dipping the bites into tomato sauce, how cool?!   I really like this place. It was my 3rd time being here and I was never disappointed .",

The first frustrating thing was that our food took a very long time to get to us. We ordered and it took about 30 min to come out. Then when we got our food I was unimpressed. The waitress did not ask how we would like our burgers done and never came to ask so they were put in as \"medium\", as we later found out. On the menu, medium is listed as having pink in the middle - both mine and my boyfriend's burger were cooked to \"medium\" but anyone who saw it would say it was well done. The meat had no pink and was so dry I had to dip it in ketchup just to get it down. I also got bacon on my burger, and let's just say that I've had better hotel buffet bacon. My takeaway was that it was a worse version of burgatory that doesn't include fries with the price of the burger, I mean what kind of burger place charges extra for fries?",

    "text": "On a crowded Saturday night, our party of 4 was able to score a table near the back.  BRGR has a great atmosphere for a weekend dinner, and the $3 valet parking on this crowded street is a definite plus.    Our table ordered a Greek salad, fries to share, and 3 burgers: the Button Buster, Fire in the Hole, and Maui Wowie.  The salad was as expected, and the fries were plentiful.  The burgers came out very cutely presented with little wooden picks indicating the doneness ordered.  Since it was our first experience at BRGR, my partner and I were indecisive on whether to order our Button Buster rare or medium rare, as I am endlessly wary of overcooked meat.  After speaking to our server, who pointed out the \"Doneness Guide\" on our menu and assured us that they were sticklers for turning out the burgers with the correct expected doneness, we opted for medium rare.  Our burger came out medium well and tasted overcooked even to my other half, who prefers his meat more cooked than I do.  I prefer my meat rare, so to me, it tasted like someone had ruined some perfectly good short rib.  I would definitely have sent it back had I not been sharing the dish with my decidedly unpicky partner.  I did not try the other two burgers, but our friends were in agreement that they much preferred the Maui Wowie to the Fire in the Hole, which they deemed only okay.  Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed by the food and won't choose BRGR for its burgers again.",

    "text": "Honest question: does BRGR even want my patronage?  Or your patronage? Or anyone's, for that matter? Seriously, what will it take for this overpriced and overhyped rehash of a burger concept to actually, I don't know, invest in some basic training on how to run a restaurant--starting with Hospitality 101? Do they actively not want to make money, or are they just that bad of a restaurant?  Three times I've been to BRGR, at three different times of day, with three different sets of people. Each time, I've been underwhelmed by the food, and truly astonished by how poor the service is. The hostesses are downright rude. The servers--and calling them that is generous--seem to resent speaking to customers or delivering food or doing anything remotely related to their jobs. The bartender was cold and condescending when we ordered beers...which we had to approach her for, since she was ignoring us. The only thing the employees of this restaurant seem to be good at is wearing inappropriately short shorts and chatting among each other as they congregate near the bar. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed trying to flag down our waitress as we attempted to order another drink...as she leaned on the bar with her back to us. I know I've been out of the industry for a few years, but I'm pretty sure that \"if you have time to lean, you have time to clean\" still applies.  The food is overpriced, entirely uncreative, and executed poorly. I asked for a burger medium rare...which arrived extremely rare and very greasy. My SO's medium burger was a well-done, and also very greasy. We also accidentally received someone else's (presumably greasy) burger which sat on our table, getting cold, for five minutes before we were able to get the attention of the waiter who had wordlessly placed it on our table and then wordlessly retrieved it--seriously, do the managers beat them if they smile at or speak to customers? It's also downright cheap that the burgers come with nothing--that you have to order fries, etc, on the side. I once ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer, which were soggy and bland. People rave about the adult milkshakes, which are decent enough but nothing that I haven't had at, say, Red Robin before. The fries are fine if you like salt and Costco-brand shredded Parmesan.  As if the awful service and mediocre food wasn't enough, the concept and flow of this place don't even make any sense. Each time, I have been rushed through my meal--even when the restaurant has been almost empty, as it was one early Saturday evening last week. The decor is bland, except for the too-numerous televisions, which are not generally the hallmark of a gourmet experience. To top it all off, both drinks and food are overpriced--you'll pay more here for a beer than anywhere else, and for no apparent reason, because their selection is decidedly \"meh.\"  Bottom line: I would rather dine at the Petsmart across the street than experience the complete failure of a restaurant experience that is BRGR again.",

I probably wouldn't resist going back here, but I don't think I'd make a strong effort. (4/5 for the burger)  The fries were also a little bit of a disappointment.  Fries tossed with Parmesan and herbs sounds good right?  Yes, if it can be if done properly.  However, I thought BRGR's fries were a bit overcooked and hard.  The cheese and herbs kind of just stuck together and didn't seem to add a lot of flavor. (2/5 for the fries)",

The parties I went with may not be the restaurant's average clientele, but that doesn't excuse the fact that both times it took us seven to nine minutes to find a hostess to seat us, nor the fact that when we did hunt one down, she more or less sneered at us.  (The service issue persists through the entire meal--the most recent time I was there, my table waited for 20 minutes for our check after our table had been cleared, while our waitress chatted with a co-worker behind the upstairs bar).  Most disappointing michelada ever, and I (for some reason) once had one with Braggs and Thai basil at Cantina. The fact that my friend comes here on the regular specifically for beer cocktails baffles me; I seek out a michelada, as with most spicy, tomatoey cocktails, to make myself a little more human after having a few too many the night before. That BRGR managed to craft a hangover drink that tastes exactly like vomit seems to be missing the point. Truly undrinkable, and I never abandon a cocktail.  The second time I had learned my lesson, and opted for the Little Blood deconstructed cocktail. This, I was into. I'm not much of a shots person, so I alternated between sips of tequila (Espolon, my personal mid-shelf favorite) and the thick, sweet, and slightly spicy sangrita served with it. The cold can of Tecate was refreshing, and let me linger over my drink the way I want to on a Saturday afternoon, without forcing me to make a shot last for twenty minutes. It could have used a lime, but not so badly that I thought to ask for one.  Next time my friends and I need an early afternoon drink, I'm headed to the Thunderbird. But I'll admit that I'm curious to try their other deconstructed cocktails, so I may return someday. But I'll know to dress up, and give myself a lot of time.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch before heading back to New York and it was a bit disappointing.   Parking was easy on Presidents Day, but I don't know what it would be like on a normal day.   What we sampled:   Button Buster Burger             Overall it was cooked alright, but a bit overcooked when compared to the amazing job done on the burger from The Porch.  The toppings were delicious, but I was looking for something light to break through all of the heavy flavors, and it could definitely have used a bit more cheese which was almost nonexistent.   Fries with truffle cheese wiz on the side             O.M.G. truffle cheese wiz!! The fries were cooked well and were delicious, but the cheese wiz was amazing.   Fried Pickles             According to my other half Rotem these were the best fried pickles he has had outside of Mississippi, and I have to agree.  I never really understood his obsession with fried pickles until I at the ones from here!   Overall the food was just ok, but I could not stand how I could feel the vibration each time someone passed behind our table, and the service was just bizarre.  Our waiter was efficient getting our drinks and food, but then things got weird.  He collected our stuff after we were finished and then we waited....and waited....and waited....a good ten or fifteen minutes without any food or anything in front and no offer of dessert or anything before we finally had to ask for our check.  Rotem wanted to just wait and see how long it was going to take for them to bring over the check on their own, but I had to make it to the airport!",

They are creative but not overly so, flavorful, and extremely tasty.  I typically order the \"Button Buster\" cooked medium, and it is always enjoyable.  I also find both their onion rings and french fries to be excellent.  The atmosphere is very nice, and service tends to be very good as well.  However, on one or two occasions, when the restaurant was very busy, I have had disappointing service and my burger came out overcooked.  Their staff was nonetheless extremely accommodating for this issue.  If you're looking for a restaurant where you can have some very tasty burgers, a few other sides or starters, and get out spending no more than $15-20 a person with tip, Brgr is a very solid choice.",

It didn't really doesn't differentiate itself from other local gourmet burger chains like Burgatory.  The roll that was used appeared to be fresh baked and quite soft but unnecessarily greasy.  Burgers are greasy enough.  I don't think it's necessary to wipe the top of the bun down with grease just so it appears shiny.  Prices are on par with Burgatory but your burger includes no side.  Not even chips.  I really hate this trend of charging $10 for a sandwich and then charging $4 for fries, $5 for onion rings, or even more for a side salad.  At least Burgatory includes chips with their food.  I don't see this as a place I'd go to again.  There are better options for burgers in the 'Burgh.",

    "text": "It wasn't bad, it really wasn't.  But I guess I just don't understand what the hype is all about.  One quick note:  There is no light on their sign, so if you go at night, it might be tough to spot.  This place is sandwiched right between Spoon and Goodwill.   I went with a group of three and we had to wait a few minutes for our table, but were seated fairly promptly.  Our waitress was very patient as we tried to decide what we wanted, so the place gets at least 1 star just for her!  Drinks: My friend wanted a Hurricane and either they DON'T have a truly FULL bar, or the bartender didn't know how to make it because they asked if there was something else she would like instead.  She ordered the Sangria instead and said it wasn't very good.    I had the Salted Caramel Spiked Milkshake. YUM!  It was the best thing I ate all night.  The bourbon came through but not so much that it was not palatable, and the shake was just the right thickness.  I think it is the best thing I had all night.  Other than that, we all drank water.  I thought the spiked floats sounded very inventive, and if I go back I would probably try one.  Food: We ordered the Homemade Chips with Crack dip and the Fried Pickles.  The Fried Pickles were tasty, if not a bit greasy for my tastes.  They are also fried in spears, not chips, just and FYI if you're thinking of trying them.  I don't really have a preference over how the pickles are cut, but some people are picky about that kind of thing. The Homemade Chips were fresh and crisp.  The Crack did was pretty good, and we were impressed with the multiple layers of flavor, although we did note that it almost seemed like it was just melted cheese with chili mixed in.  Not sure I would call it Crack, but it was pretty good.  We all agreed the burgers were... MEH.... Not bad, not good, just a burger.  The meat tasted great and was well-cooked and I LOVE the fact that they source many of their ingredients locally, but the FLAVOR just wasn't there.  I had the Button Buster and it was like unflavored rib meat on unflavored burger meat with cheese.  The onion ring added some nice texture, but the flavor of that didn't jump out at me either.  It was just missing something... We decided, well, what do you cook ribs in?  Barbeque sauce.  So we asked for some, added it to my burger, and YUM!  So... tip: If you order the Button Buster, ask for a side of BBQ to go with it, sooooo much better.    My friend had the Fire in the Hole and thought it was a solid burger, but wasn't blown away by it.  She also said she was still hungry after dinner, but it had been a long time since she ate, so take that for what it's worth.    Our overall impression was this:  The menu seemed creative, but there was no mention of ordering a \"custom\" burger, so we didn't ask.  Alcoholic shakes = YUM.    We wouldn't recommend this to someone who was asking for a phenomenal burger, we would send them to Tessaro's.  However if we had a group of friends going to BRGR and wanted us to join, we wouldn't say 'no.'",

I had the Cease and Desist burger with carmelized onions, American cheese and 1000 Island dressing with a side of onion rings. This is the best burger and the best rings I can remember ever having...bar none!   The burger, cooked medium well, was perfectly cooked and combined with the toppings delivered a mouth pleasing experience! The burger was also sized right....not oversized to make up for inferior meat. The onion rings had a homemade crispy coating with a real circle of snappy onion.   The restaurant was comfortable, not overly noisy(except for the chatty women at the next table) with two flat screens in my line of vision.   Would it be wrong to have lunch and dinner here today? Doesn't matter....I'll be back often!",

The only real complaint that I have is that one of the hostesses needs an attitude adjustment.  I went in a couple weeks ago with a dear friend visiting from out of town and wanted to bring her to BrGr for a quick welcome drink when she arrived.  We arrived around 4pm on a weekday, when the place was virtually empty, and asked to sit on the couches (again, the whole area was empty) and the hostess curtly refused to seat us there on the grounds that we weren't eating.  It is my experience that the best way to handle policies like this is to say to the customer that they are welcome to sit where they would like as long as the place is empty, but that if a large table comes in they will have to move.  After all, we just wanted a quick drink and, based on my experience of the place, would have been out before the rush.  In any case, what was a pretty good opinion of the restaurant was seriously soured by this experience.  The hostess wasn't even apologetic, she was off-putting and generally seemed like her decision was based on power and pride, not care for the customer or the business.",

    "text": "5:30 dinner scheduled in the heart of East Liberty, or is it East Side these days.  My friend Tammy and I started at the bar of BRGR, which was surprisingly quiet for a Thursday happy hour.  However, we soon learned why the inside was quiet.  With several beers on tap, I enjoyed a cold white Belgium beer as she sipped on a glass of red.  We seemlessly closed out our tab and worked over to the hostess.  The plan was to sit on the rooftop deck and soak in the beautiful spring weather, but it was seated to full capacity (around 6 PM).  The next best table was available, a high top along Centre Avenue (great for people watching).  BRGR is a great place for folks with food allergies, as my friend made some special requests that were all met with ease.  We had a duo/team serving us, 1/2 in training.  Tammy did not want the bun, but the trainee confidently offered a lettuce wrap to replace the bun.  She also had an option to choose a healthier side vs. fries (which I ordered) and decided on a vinegar based coleslaw.  Not for everyone, I ended up eating the majority of that slaw, mixed with raisins and carrots.  My Turkey Burger was juicy and heartily topped with avocado, tomato and a sweet dressing.  A great place for candid conversation, the interior of BRGR did not change much from its previous occupant, 2Red.  Since its inception in the Pittsburgh market, BRGR has expanded to the North (Wexford), South (The Gallera Mall - Opening TBD) and PNC Park.  There is a food truck option for catering and festivals.  With higher end burger joints serving as a huge foodie trend, the price for drinks and food was a bit pricey.  That would be my only constructive comment about the experience.  Cheers!",

It has a casual, relaxed atmosphere, with plenty of TVs for sports action and big garage doors to let in the natural light.  In the late spring and summer, they open up the rooftop seating area.  It's a great place to grab a bite to eat or a drink while being outside and enjoying the warm weather.  We have dined here several times in the past few months and always order the same thing: a california turkey burger and a salad (the current seasonal salad, pickled beet, is delicious).  We order just one of each, and ask that they split the order up for us.  This means they bring out two bowls of salad and two baskets each with half a burger and pickle.  The half salad/half burger is a pretty decent portion and comes in at under $20 for two people...not bad for Shadyside.   Be warned, the parking situation at BRGR is a little sketchy.  You can either take your chances and hope you don't get towed by parking across the street, pray for a street parking spot, or cough up $3 for the valet parking.  Also, be aware that some of the menu items change seasonally.  On one occasion, we ordered our standard turkey burger+salad combo...without realizing that the turkey burger had taken on a \"Thanksgiving\" style preparation complete with cranberry, stuffing, and green beans.  Although I enjoy these side dishes as part of my family Thanksgiving dinner, I didn't like the taste of these piled onto a turkey burger and a bun.  Luckily, they've since switched it back to the much tastier cali-style burger.",

Not enough brie, or mushrooms, I would say this is a regular burger joint with a cooler atmosphere.  Came here twice already, and i think the trend is that im going to be sticking with the fries/onion rings and forget about the burger! I can't get enough of the truffle cheese whiz!",

On the downside, it is a bit expensive when you consider that the burgers don't come with a side--that is, it's $10-12 for the burger alone, and then another $3-5 for fries. So, kinda pricey. But I've been here more than once, so it's worth it!  Also, the parking situation is atrocious--either street parking on the extremely crowded Penn Circle, or risk-getting-towed parking across the street at the PetSmart lot. Try to take public transit if you can, or I guess you could pay for the valet.",

    "text": "BRGR is a great place to get drinks and comfort food with friends. The clientele and bartenders are friendly and chatty. If you want to watch a game, there are about 8 HDTV's all tuned to one of two sports channels. The burgers come in all shapes and sizes (beef, lamb, salmon, tuna, etc.) and the cocktails are very inventive (Miller Lite + Rhuby + Bitters = Genius!). The beer list is very respectable. My only gripe is with the milkshakes.  They are some serious sugary whisky-crack, and I'm just into whisky.  The downstairs has a leather-bound chair/couch and sports bar vibe that is kind of fun if you are having a night out with the peeps and want to eat some place that is not going to destroy your wallet (expect to spend ~$30 bucks per person). Most of the people who would watch a football game here are a little more on the yuppie than yinzer side, but hopefully that scene will improve. At present, it's less hipster than Kelly's but there is none of the MD-brofest that is endemic to Shadyside. The upstairs patio is nice in the summertime, but has stellar views of the now defunct Borders, AAA, and CVS East Liberty (i.e., its virtue is that you are eating outside).   It is  EASY to meet up with people here after eating at Spoon. You can literally walk from one restaurant to the other, and the cocktails are arguably more creative on the cheaper side.    On a final note, if you are stuck at Bakery Square due to your or someone else's poor planning and are not a teenage girl enthralled with the shabby-chic overpriced yardsale that is Anthropologie, it is probably the best place to spend a little downtime in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "I'm a little confused by the goal of BRGR - is it a place to hang out and eat a good burger and drink some nice beers, as suggested by the multiple TVs with sporting events?  Or is it more of a high turnover joint, wham bam, thank you ma'am, as the service would indicate?  The burgers are good, around $10-12 for each; no sides, which are extra - $3 for the chips w/cheese sauce, and $4+ for the fries.  The Kobe burger I thought was a bit disappointing, and maybe the extra $12 would have made it better - but I thought the flavor fell flat.  The Button Burger, which also has short ribs and onion rings was very, very tasty.  It was a shame I had to share half of it with my wife.  And there is a nice selection of microbrews to choose from.  So I was hoping for a nice night of a big, juicy burger, and drinking some beers -- but essentially, we got a fast-food type of waiter -- who was taking food off of our table, even though we were still grazing on the chips and fries -- and dropping off the check without asking if there was anything else, which in fact, would have been another round of beers.    I'm sure if I had a better experience, one which lasted longer than a Kardashian marriage, I'm sure I would come back.  And if you haven't been here, I still think it's worth trying.  But in the future, when I want fast-food service, I'd rather just drop the $5 for a 5 Guys Burger -- at least eating there is like having a friend with benefits... no expectations.  Oh well, I guess Burgatory is next!",

We were sitting in our car in their parking lot and I was Yelping to find a restaurant nearby (yes, I do not know the neighborhood).  Well, I think 450 feet is close enuff to walk!  So, that we did to BRGR.  I noticed from the street that they have rooftop dining so that is what we opted for this warm October day.  They even had overhead heaters and curtains so that it was sufficiently warm enuff.  I ordered the steakhouse brgr for 13.00 which was, per their menu, \"8 oz handcrafted dry-aged prime beef, A1 aioli, arugula, onion straws, dry bleu cheese\".  I ordered it medium and it came out just the way I wanted.  I also ordered a side order of tater tots.  I must say their sides are portion sized for two so keep that in mind if you and your dining partner are ordering.  I didn't have room for a milkshake (next time).    I enjoyed my burger and tots and the family-friendly atmosphere on the top deck.  It was fun people watching as we sat by the edge.",

It was literally the best shake I've ever had... Amazing.   For dinner, I went with the Shrooms burger-- burger, forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, brie cheese & mustard aioli. My Burger was fabulous. I ordered a side of fries which has a nice season to the and sprinkled with cheese.  My bf ordered the Button Buster-- burger, short ribs, Cheddar cheese & an onion ring. He also ordered potato salad as a side. I tried both his Burger and salad & both were great. Burger was a little too much for me, but I loved the salad which was topped with fresh bacon.   While our server was kind, he gave off this 'I don't really wanna be here' attitude. I initially wanted to give 3(.5) stars but decided to round it up to 4 because I know we'll be back.  I'm excited that we finally experienced BRGR. it was a good meal. I do want to note that I've never had Burgatory before.. I noticed a lot of reviews stating that it was better than here.

It took about 15-20 minutes for each meal to come out. The meals were sloppy and tables were greasy. The service was slow and the waiter didn't check on us. Sadly, I'm going to have to rate this restaurant 3 stars.",

The chipotle BBQ sauce and smoked cheddar cheese toppings made it delicious.  The burger itself was juicy and had lots of flavor.  I, personally, prefer a little thicker of a patty, but my wife thought it was perfect.  The spiked chocolate chip cookie dough milkshake was good, but it was basically a vanilla shake with a couple big chunks of cookie dough.  The pork and tots appetizer was also good, but it seemed like something was missing.  I think it needed some more onion in addition to the few green onion bits on top of the dish.  But the concept was commendable.  All in all - a pleasant experience.",

For one, they changed ice cream suppliers. Used to be Dave & Andy's as I recall but new vendor does not furnish quality ice cream and the shake was not only smaller but lacked flavor. Our server suggested that we ask for more chocolate syrup next time but that won't cure the problem.   Burgers were smaller and not the best in the Burgh that they once were. At this pace BRGR will follow the demise of Grit & Grace for basically the same reasons. No customers because there are too many better alternatives.",

You can build any kind of burger you can dream of - but look closely. Those add-ons can really rack up your bill! I'm also a big fan of their Greek salad if you're looking for a lighter option, and of course, you top off your meal with a milkshake (alcoholic ones are delicious!) Just be hesitant that the bill can get expensive quickly! Great location and valet parking available.",

I arrived 30 mins before closing and was greeted warmly, without any of the usual \"have you seen what time it is?!\" attitude. I ordered a Woodford and ginger, and an Angus on brioche, with avocado and cole slaw to-go, topped with smoked cheddar and a taste of aioli; the avocado is a standard, gratis topping (HUGE bonus). One of the staff cheerfully brought my burger out, as he was leaving; again, with a warm disposition. What greeted my mouth when I got back to my room was nothing short of tongue heaven.  The burger was exactly as I ordered it, the ingredients were fresh and overall this was one of the best burgers I have ever had. Whatever they do with this cole slaw is both unique and amazing; it is a thick-cut, deep and complex topping -- not something most places even come close to.  Could my experience have been a fluke and some of these other less thrilling reviews here are True? I doubt it. What other restaurant in the world puts their best food and best foot forward at 10:30 at night, mere minutes before they close? To me, BRGR is a gem and I look forward to a repeat dinner tonight.",

I guess I can't be too upset though because that's what you get with any burger.   We ordered the grilled cheese bites to start, 3 different burgers, and fries and onion rings. All of us liked the flavors of the burgers and we're impressed with the onion rings. They were the best onion rings I've ever had!!!! I really wish the fries were able to just come with truffle oil and not the combo truffle oil and cheese wiz.   Overall, great service and good burgers. I would definitely head back there with my dad and brother (haha)!",

On the other hand, that's a nice place (despite the very many TVs...: that's a bit distracting): adult, comfortable, slightly upscale but not pretentious.

This burger has a turkey patty, cranberry aioli, pickled green beans, stuffing, and gravy--basically, it's Thanksgiving on a bun!  What a novel--and delicious--concept!  It was as delectable as it sounds.  My only complaint is that, if you put the gravy that comes on the side on it, it's quite messy, so make sure you ask for some extra napkins to clean up!  I ordered the tater tots with it, which were great for splitting between my dining companion, if a bit pedestrian.  On a subsequent visit, I ordered the homemade chips with it, which were also great to split, but again, I've had better (at Fat Heads). I also ordered the chocolate cherry bourbon spiked float, which had a nice smooth flavor.  I'm not a huge bourbon fan, however, and I preferred the adult root beer float, which I tried on a subsequent visit (yum!).  I went on a Sat. evening, and there was no wait.  Per the hostess's suggestion, I dined on the rooftop deck, which has a relaxed atmosphere and a great view of East Liberty/Shadyside.  Even though it was chilly, I didn't feel cold, thanks to the heat lamps.  Service was attentive without being overbearing.  Re: the question of BRGR vs. Burgatory, I thought the burgers (turkey and chicken, respectively) were very similar in quality.  Given that I don't eat beef, I can't comment on the beef burgers, or matters such as doneness.  I preferred the atmosphere at BRGR, whereas the shakes at Burgatory are more innovative.  I also felt that the sides were better at Burgatory, and I like that Burgatory provides free chips, at least (BRGR serves all entrees strictly a la carte, with no sides).  Location-wise, BRGR is more convenient to me.  Between all of these factors, it's a close toss-up, but Burgatory has a slight edge on food quality/innovativeness and value.",

Lightly 6 big spears, lightly breaded, with good ranch dip.  Got the BRGR signature burger, medium.  Cooked to specification, unique toppings/flavor combinations.  Agree with others that you should share a basket of fries.  I can eat a lot, and the two of us could not finish off a basket of fries.  Recommend the truffle cheese whiz to go with them.  Did not have room for a shake, but they sound good.  Will get one next time.  Decor is nice inside.  Our waiter, Brian was very nice.  Would go back.",

I had such a bad taste in my mouth that I almost didn't want to go when a group of friends suggested we have dinner there.  BRGR seems to have re-tooled during the time that I was refusing to go, because my last visit was fantastic. The hostesses were awesome, our server (Sam) was spectular, the food and drinks were great - the menu is different.  I won't hesitate to go back.",

The veggie burger was too soft and salty, so on our second trip here I got the king salmon burger and it was muchhh better. I wish the buns were not so soft, maybe they could grill them, since the veggie/fish burgers are not very firm.   What makes this place for me is the sides! I love the fried pickles, they have the perfect crunchy shell and the pickles themselves are tasty! Onion rings were good but not amazing, I really enjoy the dips you can select for the fries.   I got a beertail last time I was here and it was pretty good, not too sweet so it goes well with the food!  Not the best burger I have ever had but it's good and we've never had a problem getting a table.",

I got the smokehouse bison with sweet potato fries. DELICIOUS. My boyfriend got the fire house which he also loved. The best part was honestly that \"crack\" dip that comes with the housemade chips. I literally laughed at it but my boyfriend got it and that was the first thing we finished! It tastes like some kind of meat chili dip!   The cocktails were a bit pricey for its size but the bartender was so friendly. He really didn't pour us \"cheap\" drinks as in, he didn't water down the drinks at all! They were talkative with us and even gave us some tastes of milkshakes! They have happy hour Monday through Friday 4-6 PM.   Can't wait to go back ASAP!",

There are create your own burgers and menu options, sides, shakes, and spiked shakes. The food is all good, not great, but there unfortunately is never much of a crowd from the times I've gone or stopped by. The rooftop seating area is very pretty, but it's very quiet (no music, background noise) and the main dining area is usually a little \"dead\" too. Not a bad place to get a snack or a spiked shake for dessert, but there are better options in the area including other burger options.",

It's wasn't busy at all so I was hesitant but it turned out to be a really good burger joint. It was a stormy night so that is probably why it wasn't busy. My husband had the salmon burger and I had the Average Joe burger with bacon. They do not come with fries; the sides are ala carte so we ordered the half Greek salad and sweet potato fries which came with a chipotle bbq sauce. The Greek salad was a generous helping and so were the fries. All of our entrees were delicious and packed with flavor. The bartender who was also our waiter was welcoming and helpful. I would definitely come back if I was ever back in Pittsburgh :)",

The interior is pretty hip, warm, trendy etc. But the food is fairly standard bar/burger items with a few twists like spiked milkshakes and multiple sides that interested me.   The service was pretty abysmal but our waiter admitted they were understaffed and he was clearly doing the best he could. But our food came out in a timely manner and was pretty tasty.   I got the Santa Fe Hippie, their version of a black bean/falafel burger that was good and the rest of my group was pleased with their angus burgers. We got a side of chips and the house crack dip, which was a little cold from probably sitting around and the ratio of chips to dip was way off IMHO.   Overall if I was back in Pittsburgh this would by no means be my first stop, but it is worth a look if you happen to be nearby.",

They have regular angus, dry aged beef, bison, chicken and just anything you would want on a burger. I really like the condiments as well.

    "text": "I've been here a few times in the past, and it was honestly just alright. This night however was awful. We went in on a Thursday evening, and it wasn't too busy. We sat immediately, and was greeted by our server who informed us that she was training another server. We order drinks, which took a bit. I ordered a Cookies'n Cream milkshake, and when my milkshake came it didn't look like Cookies'n Cream. I took a sip, and I was definitely a peanut butter shake. I informed the waitress who said, \"Oh, I saw you pointing at Cookies'n Cream, but I thought you said peanut butter.\" Well thank god I don't have a peanut allergy, because that could have been a really bad situation if I did. After waiting a while longer, I received my shake. Not that it was worth the wait, because it was totally melted, with the center being really thick. Wouldn't surprise me if they didn't even blend it. A while later, my food came, but my mom's did not. It appeared that they forgot her food, and they said that they would go to look for it. A little while later, the server returned with the wrong burger, and immediately took off. We flagged down our trainee, who tried to claim that's what she ordered, but said she would try to find our server. I realized at this point that my order was half wrong, but I was too hungry and annoyed at this point to complain. Instead of our server coming over, the manager came over and we told him that basically everything had been wrong. He offered to bring the correct order, and our original server was nowhere to be found. The manager came back shortly with the correct order, and told us that he would take half off the bill. Frankly, at this point the meal should have been free. Our server came by later with the bill and said, \"Well, due to my horrific performance you got a pretty good discount.\"  Ignoring all the service problems, the burgers are really thin and nothing special. If you want a good burger I would recommend Butterjoint in Oakland, Murray Avenue Grill in Squirrel Hill, or just go to Five Guys. We do not plan on returning and I would not recommend to anyone.",

And of course you'll want a milkshake, which will cost you $6 more. That's almost $20 a meal! A little too steep for me, BUT the food was tasty. I used Postmates for delivery and they didn't have milkshakes on the menu, which was disappointing. I'm pretty sure Grub Hub does though.

    "text": "For someone who does not really enjoy the flavor of meat (I know either discredit this review or write me off as not-human), I've gone to BRGR a fair number of times because their hamburgers can be made so well! From my experiences their Average Joe burger is the classic lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, burger patty that really hits the spot whenever I crave a salty, medium-rare, juicy, delicious hunk of beef. I would say 3/4 of the time they grill the patties perfectly. On the side I often order onion rings. The batter is light, crispy, flavorful, and fairly light.   Overall, the average joe is a burger that you cannot go wrong with! The only gripe I have is that some times they are not made consistently, and I sometimes end up eating a salty, meaty hunk of \"cardboard\" between two fluffy brioche buns with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and a pickle on the side. But again, the upside is that it happens less than the majority of times.",

The restaurant is right in the center of the regentrified East Liberty, and the inside feels just like that - upscale urban. Our waiter was super-attentive. We shared the grilled cheese bites, the poutine with the short rib and the caprese burger. Everything was delicious, but the caprese burger was the best burger I've ever had. By the time we were leaving, it was starting to fill up, and they had valet outside.",

Call me crazy but usually I'm offered a drink by now. We tried calling for her but she walked past us...twice. When she finally returned another 5 minutes later we both asked for a beer. we were answered with a \"ok gimme one sec\" in which she walked away...AGAIN. So after spending 15 minutes at a bar in a burger joint the only thing I was given was a glass of water. we got up and walked out. I'll never be back  *also just to be clear the place was NOT busy. especially the bar which had one other customer at it only",

    "text": "Today a friend and I arrived BRGR around 2:30 PM and after a minute of waiting, a server came up to us and said that there were people leaving a table and that it would be cleared so we could sit. There were about 4 servers on duty, and the place was pretty full, so that was totally fine. However, as I watched the server of the section near the windows walk by the table that was supposed to be cleared for us without doing ANYTHING about it a few times, I started to wonder if anyone was going to clear it. Finally, after 5 minutes of multiple servers continuously walking by the table and other servers literally just CHILLING near the hostess stand doing nothing, the busboy seemed to come out of nowhere (we hadn't seen him up until then), and cleared the table.   Once the table was cleared, we expected someone to come bring us to our table. NOPE. Two servers, a tall guy and a young brunette, literally just stood there, occasionally looking at us, not saying anything. It was absolutely ridiculous. And just for the record, I have been a server at multiple restaurants so I know how hard of a job it is, and I understand why little things go wrong and don't stress out about them. But this was absurd. Like seriously, how are the servers (at least the ones we encountered today) at this restaurant so completely incompetent?! Anyway, we just turned around and left! Never coming back here again.",

If you are vegetarian or pescatarian, there are reasonable options.  The setting is casual and the food comes quickly even when the place is busy.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night just because we were hungry and in the area. It wasn't the worst experience we've ever had, but neither of us would ever go back or go out of our way to suggest it to really anyone who would ask our opinion(s).   PROS: Pretty good burgers, temp well maintained, chairs were comfortable, tons of TVs if that's what you're into, solid selection of liquors, sleek/modern design that I really liked, decent amount of seating for parties of 3 or less for quick seating.  CONS: -SMALL! -Although we only had a party of 2 it took almost 5mins to get a seat because whoever the guy up front was couldn't find either of his hostesses in the restaurant that was barely bigger than your average local drugstore. -It took almost another 5mins just to get waters we didn't ask for and get blown off by our server for another 3mins until we could place a drink order. -Despite the full bar and 2-3 bartenders it took 10mins to get drinks and place our food order. Also, a top shelf baybreeze (Belvedere, pineapple, and cranberry juice) somehow cost $12 which is absurd even for a restaurant. -The chips with \"crack sauce\" we ordered was terrible. The chips tasted like they were baked lays from a bag, refried in old peanut oil. And the \"crack sauce\" tasted like tostitos cheese sauce with chili powder or maybe taco seasoning.  Once we had our food we didn't ask for much because we figured we'd be done eating by the time any of it actually came, so there weren't many opportunities to screw up, but somehow we were left with only 2 napkins for our meal despite asking twice. The only reason they're getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because everyone we dealt with was actually really nice.  My biggest warning would be for those in parties of 4 or more or even smaller parties that show up too late: There are only 3-5 designated 4 seat tables, and then there's this enormous L-shaped booth seat with small, 2-person tables. There are literally maybe 18\" maximum between each table and there are the designated bigger tables in the not-so-open space next to that mass. Extremely crowded. To the point that if I were to go back I'd call and try to reserve a tall table, and if they couldn't accommodate I'd just take my business elsewhere.",

We split a couple of apps and a shake, and I was pleasantly surprised by both the food and the service. The grilled cheese bites were flavorful and not overly greasy, and it's hard to go wrong with the ingredients in the pork-n-tots. The only thing that disappointed was the \"crack\" dip--the description sounded like huacaina dip, which truly is crack, but we found ourselves dipping our remaining chips into the other dishes' respective sauces. Salty caramel milkshake gets two thumbs up, especially since I can't get my PB&J shake at Burgatory anymore...the world needs more not-overly-sweet milkshakes!",

I have never had the experience of dining at BRGR and feeling as if the staff cared about their work or the quality of product - as a server myself, I can only assume this has something to do with management.  My most recent meal at BRGR was especially disappointing. I ordered my burger medium rare, but it arrived really very rare. I can get down with a rare burger - especially at Burgatory, where they get a great sear on the patty - but not this one. Inside, the beef was cold and mealy, so I asked for it to be brought up a bit. My server said, \"So you want it medium?\" I responded that I wanted it as ordered - medium rare. It came back medium, and was honestly just not very carefully prepared. The lettuce was wilted, the tomatoes were watery and the cheese not melted.  Again, I am a server, and not much bothers me more at work than the first world problems of entitled guests. What gets me down about BRGR is not necessarily the fact that I wasn't served a perfect meal, but that their disregard, both for customers and product is painfully evident. BRGR could be great if their team cared to make it so.",

I've been here a couple times and the burgers are always perfectly cooked to order. It's usually pretty busy but with any luck you can sit and eat at the bar. I also love that BRGR is at PNC Park and they often do promotions at the ballpark where you can text to get free fries and stuff like that.",

It's probably because the last time I was here, I asked for medium plus on my burger, and our waitress looked at me like I was crazy and told me that was not possible. Ok? How is that not possible? I understand that there is no button option on the ordering screen for \"medium plus,\" but I'm pretty sure it's possible to jot a note to the chef. Anyway, needless to say, the meal started off on a sour note for me.  I've been back two times since, and on both occasions, my burgers were dry. I tried the salmon burger once as well as the hippie burger on the other occasion. The burgers were fine, and the fries are actually very delicious, as well as the milkshakes, but I prefer Burgatory.

    "text": "Since I have been here twice now; once during a busy Friday night and once during a regular weekday dinner, I feel I can more accurately review this place.  (And since having a burger at Burgatory - I had to come back and take away another star) Yes, SOME burgers are as amazing as everyone is claiming; however, it's other areas that only make me give it 2 stars. The service is hit or miss.  Busy Friday night, don't expect to see your server all that much because they get busy.  Plus, the first time we were there, we were directed to go upstairs by the hostess because our \"table was ready\". When we got upstairs, all 3 servers acted as if we were the next inconvenience and there wasn't a \"table ready\". Also, if you are sitting upstairs, you can't start off with an appetizer because the food runner only makes one trip per table, and everything will come out at once. Sitting downstairs, you can enjoy a Pre-meal app. The menu changes.  I am all for change, but you definitely can't go back for a \"favorite\" if a particular burger really won you over.  We went back for \"The Devonshire\" to only see it's absence from the menu. Also, if you're famished, like can EAT A BURGER famished, sadly, this isn't your place.  The pricey burgers don't come with sides and are presented in a basket with paper.  A side of chips or fries to add to your burger are $4+; so you may be more likely to share if you're on a budget.  Both times, I have left still hungry because there is A LOT of bun on those burgers, and sharing a side of (cold) \"homemade chips\" doesn't cut it.  Plus, for what we pay, I at least expect a bit more creativity in the presentation besides a burger basket. And I won't lie - I think the TVs downstairs are really tacky and totally take away from the ambiance.  They have this sleek and modern interior that totally gets lost with everyone's necks craning upwards to watch TV.  Is it a sports bar or a restaurant?  I'm confused... This is a great place to get a \"bite\" to eat, especially if you're craving a quality, yet very creative burger - this can be your place.  However, if you still want a good burger, but a MEAL that will leave you bursting your buttons, go to Buffalo Blues, Tessaro's or Burgatory.",

    "text": "If you've been keeping up our restaurant reviews, you may have read my recent article on Spoon.  Spoon is an eclectic restaurant in East Liberty with carefully prepared, delicious food.  Brian Pekarcik, the Executive Chef and owner of Spoon, recently opened up another eating establishment next to Spoon.  The new restaurant Brgr, can be described as a contemporary burger joint, with a heavy dose of sophistication.  Brgr, located at 134 South Highland Avenue, enjoys a prime location in the east section of town that has recently experienced a rejuvenation of sorts.  New businesses have been popping up in this section of the city, attracting a diverse and loyal clientele. The decor of Brgr is understated yet sophisticated.  The front of the restaurant has large glass garage doors that provide an excellent view- I imagine, in the summer when the large doors are open, this will be a prime location for people-watching.  There's plenty of room in the dining area, so you don't have to worry about bumping into your fellow diners, and the wait staff has ample room to move around comfortably.     Drinks: Brgr has a fun drink menu.  I ordered a Jamaican Ginger Ale.  It was spicy, and had a heavy ginger after-taste- awesome.  We also got a Spiked Float (a Brgr specialty with booze) which included root liqueur, local seltzer, and vanilla bean ice cream.  Here's the cool part- the waitress finished off the drink with an old-styled seltzer bottle!  The drink was refreshing, and the rich vanilla ice cream was a nice combination with the root liqueur.    My favorite beverage was the Dark Horse Brewery Special Black Bier- it was thick, rich, and had many layers of complex flavors.  If you prefer lighter drafts, Brgr carries 14 to choose from.  Food: The menu at Brgr isn't complex, but it covers a wide variety of selections.  If you're not in the mood for a beef burger, you can opt for the Gobble Gobble ($7.00).  This turkey burger is served with pickled green beans, crispy stuffing, and cranberry aioli.  If you're a vegetarian, try The Tree Hugger ($8.00), with lentil, falafel, sour cucumbers, tomato, red onion and goat's milk yogurt.  We chose the Salmon Burger ($9.00), 6 oz. of wild king salmon with cucumbers, tomato relish, apple-wood smoked bacon and caper aioli.  Also ordered- The Tree Hugger, Kobe Beef Burger ($13.00) served with pickled onions, arugula, creamy blue cheese, and oven-roasted tomatoes (add fois gras for $12.00).  A spicy Fire in the Hole ($9.00) was chosen by one of our more adventurous guests; it comes with guacamole, jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, and chipotle mayonnaise.  Burgers come without fries- (order for an additional $4.00).   If you're not interested in having a burger, try a Smith's local hot dog ($5.00) a BLT Salad ($7.00), or the Greek Salad ($9.00).    Our food arrived in 10 minutes- we were all a bit surprised and quite happy because our hunger had really set in.  All of the burgers were served in a small metal basket with parchment paper.  When I took my first bite of the Kobe burger, I noticed how sweet and soft the bun was.  The yeasty roll was toasted with butter, and reminded me of a good brioche.  The Kobe beef was cooked medium, and was juicy and well seasoned.  The creamy blue cheese and spicy arugula were a tasty grouping of flavors and texture.  The cool roasted tomatoes were naturally tender and fresh.  I tasted the falafel burger, and was pleasantly surprised at the generous amount of spices in the mixture- the goat's milk yogurt cooled off my palate, and the cucumbers, tomatoes, and red onions readied my mouth for another bite.  The French fries were definitely a high-point; the thin, crisp strips of potato were salty, and covered with fresh parsley- the portion was generous; plenty for two to three people to enjoy. Dessert: Desserts include a cookie ice cream sandwich ($5.00), and a chocolate brownie ala mode ($6.00).  We decided to try another house specialty, their milkshakes.  A vanilla bean milkshake arrived in a large, stainless steel filled with creamy goodness.  The oversize green straw assured that each mouthful of this delicious, smooth concoction was delivered appropriately.  Yum. Service:     Service at Brgr is excellent.  From the time we entered, we were treated with great care.  We were seated immediately, and introduced to our waitress.  The drink order arrived promptly, as did our food.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable, and easy to talk to. Conclusion: Brgr is a fun place to eat- its hip, contemporary vibe is comfortable, but not trendy.  The high-quality of food and drink will surely impress you.  If you're looking for a great burger at a reasonable price, swing by Brgr for a meal with your family and friends- just make sure to get there before 6pm, the place is packed almost every night.",

    "text": "I've tried this place once, and did not have a good experience.  BRGR bills itself as, \"Pittsburgh's first gourmet burger bar\".  Well, first of all, you might argue that Tessaro's, BRGR's competition located in an adjacent neighborhood, is Pittsburgh first \"gourmet\" (I hate that term, so overused) burger joint - predating BRGR by a couple of decades.  Secondly, for a restaurant that bills itself as a \"first\", you might wonder why they chose a non-novel name - the very same abbreviation is used as the name of several \"high-end\" burger restaurants in NYC, Kansas, and Texas.    So let's talk about the \"gourmet\" burgers served at BRGR.  I don't really understand why they describe their burgers as \"gourmet\", as nothing is noteworthy about the meat used to make their burgers.  In every other \"gourmet\" burger restaurant that I've been to in other cities, I noticed that the restaurant had gone to great lengths to describe the locally-raised, grass-fed beef that went into their freshly-ground burgers.  BRGR never mentions the source, feed, or freshness of its burger meat.    Upon tasting the burger, you quickly understand why - the burger is made from everyday commercially-raised meat.  It doesn't taste like anything particularly special.  It's a reasonably good burger - just nothing special.  It isn't anywhere near as good as Tessaro's - which is about the same price (for the burger alone, more to continue).  My girlfriend and I ordered both ordinary potato fries and sweet potato fries with our burgers.  The sweet potato fries were inedible - limp, wet, and oil-laden.  A single fry, lifted by two fingertips at its end, would double back on itself under its own weight.  We told the server that they were inedible and sent them back uneaten.  The potato fries were edible, just not very good - they were soft, undercooked (a soft yellow, without any crust that you expect in a good fry) and disappointing.  A \"gourmet\" burger joint ought to be able to serve a proper french fry: par-fried first at a lower temperature to first cook the interior creating big pillowy granules of fluffy starch, then flash-fried to order at a high temperature, properly caramelizing the exterior leaving the fry with a delicious tasty crust.  This isn't hard folks - I can do it in my own kitchen - why can't a self-professed \"gourmet\" restaurant do it in a professional kitchen?  The service during our visit was awful.  I was unfamiliar with a beer on the draft list and asked what type of beer it was.  Our server said, \"I don't know\" and stared at me.  I asked her to find out.  When she returned, I was told, \"It's a kind of a dark-type of a beer\".  Yikes.  Our server then proceeded to bring the wrong beer - and told us, \"I'm sorry, I was talking to my friends and forgot which beer you ordered\".  Yikes.  She also didn't deduct the inedible sweet potato fries from the order, until we reminded her.  All in all, she was a human conveyor belt - without knowledge, charm, or any detectable interest in her work.  It was way below par.  The atmosphere isn't to my taste - it has the look and feel of a high-end sports bar, with plasma TVs blaring sports entertainment from virtually every wall/corner.  There are a few plush-looking leather couches, likely remnants from the space's past life as a high-end cocktail bar, but I think you're paying for them.  Meaning, the prices are too high.  The burgers themselves seem reasonable ($6-$13, average over $8.50) - until you see that they do not come with any sides, which cost extra ($4 for fries, $5 for onion rings).  Draft beer is expensive - over half of the draft selections were in the $6.5 to $8.5 range for a pint of beer!  Dinner for two (two burgers, two sides, four beers) was over $57 - before a $4 fry was removed from the tab.    All in all BRGR simply isn't worth the price.  If you want a far better burger, for a far better value, you're far better off going two miles away to Tessaro's.",

    "text": "After reading lots of mixed reviews, I am here to offer yet another mixed review! I really enjoyed the atmosphere, we were seated on the first floor at a table in front of the large garage doors that open out onto the street. Had we not been seated here, the other dining spaces looked cramped and very, very close to guests at the bar. Our server was friendly and efficient, but the hostess was not. We walked in with our (almost) 3 year old and your could immediately tell she was disgusted...even heard her mumble to another employee about why you would bring a child to a bar? Meanwhile, there were at least 2 other toddlers in the restaurant at the time AND and infant in a carseat/carrier on one of the sofas! Also keep in mind this was a Thursday evening at 6 pm, not Saturday night at midnight! And did I also mention that BRGR HAS a separate kids-only menu! Prior to actually dining at BRGR, I had no idea it was being billed as a BAR, rather I thought it was a burger restaurant with a full service bar. Management might want to check into how they want the employees branding their business.   Other than that the food was okay, not bad, but not anything that has me in a real hurry to go back. Burgers were large enough but did not come with any sides -- fries, orings, etc -- were all ala carte. I like that they were happy to accommodate my special requests in modifying one of their signature burgers, but feel like there should be a few more options on the menu. In theory the Spiked Milkshakes would be good, but they were seriously over the top sugary. I will definitely return to BRGR at some point, just probably not on a regular basis.",

We each had burgers, fries and I sampled the cole slaw.  Walked away only $65 poorer ($80 with the tip).   I mention the price at the beginning only because I was impressed that a place this nice with a staff so professional and friendly wasn't charging FAR more.  I honestly didn't expect to pay $6 for a burger in a place like this.     We ordered the 'average joe' with provolone and bacon.   Decent burger.  Well made.  Fresh bun and toppings.     Have to agree with Alan about the fries.  Very nicely cooked but I had a hard time tasting the parmesan.     The cole slaw was very good, and I like the large \"chunky\" approach.  The bar staff was attentive, prompt and friendly without going overboard.     I also appreciated the good mix of people at BRGR: families, older couples, young singles, etc.   And though the place had an energy to it, you could still hold a conversation without having to shout.    I think this is going to become one of my regular hangouts.   Decent food, priced fairly in a comfortable atmosphere and with solid service.",

Sometimes it gets filled with too many hipsters and the whole bar is circled with people drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon.  I like BRGR more than Burgatory.

The burger was a bit dry and the sauce overpowered the aftertaste. Again, if you are strictly a burger joint the burgers should be prepared perfectly every time. The fries were excellent with a little cheese and spice on a standard order. The menu offered enough of a selection to meet everyone's needs.   The atmosphere is great. Great beer selection and a knowledgeable bar staff. Great place to hang out with a few friends.   I would go back to try another burger on the menu. If I got this burger in a standard restaurant I would have been more than happy. But in a specialty burger joint I have higher expectations which BRGR did not live up to.",

On prior trips I've gone on the weekend and had to wait longer than Kim Kardashian's marriage.  We were quickly seated and our server was very friendly. For some reason, I wasn't feeling terribly adventurous tonight and decided to just get the Average Joe with feta bacon and a side of fries.  The food came out and looked great, but my burger seemed out of place on such a large bun. In prior experiences I hadn't noticed this because it was covered in so much other deliciousness (see the short ribs on the button buster). The food tasted ok. The burger wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The same can be said for the fries as well.   Overall, the food at BRGR is decent, but it's probably not going to knock your socks off, especially compared to some of the other burger places in Pittsburgh.",

So I assumed that perhaps someone that had recently made the salmon burger was assembling my burger.  But other than that it was really good - it was medium well as I requested and it was spicy which was a plus.  I ate the whole thing and enjoyed every bite, other than the salmon tasting ones - which were about 4 bites.    You have to order fries separately which I did, and shared with the people I was with.  The fries were crisp and perfectly seasoned to my taste.    I would recommend this place.  I'm glad I checked it out.",

This is obviously why I LOVE the plethora of burger joints in this city. BRGR is at the top of my list. So far I've had the Ceast and Desist burger and the Average Joe burger both of which were incredibly delicious in their own ways. The Ceast and Desist incorporates one of my other loves: Thousand Island Dressing! The Average Joe burger is your basic burger but I am a strong believer in the idea, \"if it's not broke, don't fix it!\" I encourage you to add bacon though!   The shakes are another one of my favorites at BRGR. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the caramel milkshake. My husband got the Hot Chocolate one the other day for his birthday and he said it was delicious too. I definitely recommend splitting a basket of fries with whoever you go with. I usually hate sharing my food but the basket is too big for even this die hard fan to eat by herself.  The only downside is BRGR's popularity. I've gotten lucky a few times and got a table right away but the last time we waited for a half hour for a table on a Thursday night.",

Our group got several baskets of various fried things, all of which were very tasty. I hear they also have an extensive menu of milk shakes that are good, but I didn't try any myself.  Trendy decor and dining accouterments, even if I thought it pretentious that the name of the restaurant is actually \"B\" \"R\" \"G\" \"R\" and not \"burger\". This restaurant is right next to Spoon, and both are owned by the same person(s) and share kitchens   Similar to my experience with Six Penn Kitchen, I took a colleague here for lunch as a farewell for good luck in his new job he was moving on to. BRGR was a great place to go for the occasion and it had a nice atmosphere. The front of the building has garage doors, so I imagine those get opened in the summer months.",

    "text": "Unable to visit the much-hyped (and farther away) Burgatory, our party heeded a friend's recommendation to visit this more conveniently located, burger-focused eatery for Sunday lunch. We had tried to go the night prior, but the wait for four was 1.5 hours (!). Fortunately, the wait for our party of 7 was a more reasonable 30 minutes, but the bar was mostly empty so we chose to dine there immediately. I can't really speak to the normal, table-based service, but our bartender was quite gregarious and affable. She provided great menu suggestions and even helped us make plans for later in the evening.  BRGR has a fairly solid tap and bottle list, with only a draft line or two dedicated to common swill and the rest to quality, craft brews. The food didn't quite match expectations but still hit the spot. My bison burger was overcooked past the requisite medium rare and seemed to lack the promised crunchy onion straws, but was nonetheless tasty with smoky chipotle aioli, tender mushrooms, and sharp cheddar. In contrast, my companion's \"Fire in the Hole\" arrived at a perfect medium rare and was quite delicious.   Ditto on another friend's short rib \"Button Buster,\" which leads one to believe the kitchen possesses more skill with cooking beef than the menu's more exotic offerings. The quality of the patties (both bison and beef) shone in the burgers. Vegetarian friends enjoyed their veggie burgers, which boasted a falafel patty rather than the de rigueur fake meat/mixed vegetable variety.  Sides were exemplary, especially the wholesome, crispy-creamy-zesty Cajun tater tots. It's unfortunate you have to pay extra for fries/tots/onion rings but that's the way this joint does things, I guess. At least the side portions are big enough to share. I couldn't taste what was \"spiked\" about BRGR's coffee milkshake, but it nonetheless was tasty and a good example of dairy craft. BRGR can be a little pricey and the waits can be surprisingly long (no reservations and a 1.5 hour wait for 4 on Saturday night), but if the burger craving strikes this place's creations will undoubtedly hit the spot.",

The restaurant didn't seem to be at full capacity; however,  we ventured to the neighborhood in order to try this burger spot, so we didn't want to overhaul our plans. #endrant  Once we were seated, I ordered the BRGR fries and a alcoholic milkshake (the Cupajoe). The fries were thick cut and soft - not quite to my liking. They were also covered in shredded Parmesan cheese which didn't work for me. The shake was where the night started to improve. The alcohol the used was a bit poignant - not strong but overwhelming in taste. Otherwise, the shake was decent. I enjoyed the alcoholic shakes at Burgatory more.  The night hit it off for me when we switched from a high table to one of the cozy couch areas. These areas are meant for about five people and are great for talking with a group while chowing down and watching the game on a multitude of screens (inclduing a large projector screen).  The high point was the burger. I ordered the shrooms burger cooked at rare. The rare is more like medium rare at other places which was perfect for me. It was so juicy. It came with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and a drawing mustard aioli. It was so sweet and savory. Just a superb all-around burger. I would certainly return for it.  In terms of the overall experience, I prefer Burgatory to BRGR, but I wouldn't discount BRGR for a good burger especially when you're in the area.",

    "text": "Seems like reviews for BRGR are quite mixed. I was pretty happy with the food and service though; it probably helped that it wasn't so busy on a Sunday afternoon. I really like the setup of the place, being both festive and casual at the same time. Our waiter got us seated and our orders taken pretty quickly, and the food came out shortly after.   I don't think the burgers here are that much pricier than elsewhere, although I guess one reason might be that they do not come with a side by default. I'm not too sad about the lack of side though, as the burgers are pretty heavy already. I found mine very juicy (got the one with the short rib strips), with a large tender patty draped with cheese and onions. I feel that this can hold its own against Wingharts (and personally I may even prefer BRGR).",

Decent size, comfortable, airy( hey I've been to some stuffy patios before)   CONS -it takes a lot of walking to get the patio. So if you're elderly or have bad knees/joints/etc forget it -small food selection. It's like a mini, crappier Burgatory.  -It wasn't even busy and the food came quick but it was cold. The cheese was congealed. The meat flavorless and grainy. Not fresh whatsoever! Seems like they were cleaning out the refrigerator. I'm over this place.  -you don't get chips or fries with your cold, over priced,  flavorless sandwich.   BONUS ROUND -me and my friends all got food poisoning the last time we went. So, nope not coming here ever again.",

    "text": "I have been to the BRGR location in Shadyside several times since it first opened and while it isn't a fine dining restaurant, I have always enjoyed both the food and the service. It is a good neighborhood spot for a decent burger. Or it used to be. I was extremely disappointed when I went there last week (Saturday) for several reasons: 1) The Service or lack thereof - we were promptly seated when we arrived which was surprising for a Saturday evening. The restaurant was not as crowded as I have seen it in the past. Perhaps our experience that day is an indicator of why it was so quiet. The hostess was pleasant and very friendly. We remained seated for a good 20 plus minutes and not a person showed up with water, silverware or to take out order. I had to finally get up and go to the hostess and ask her if she could send someone to take our order. Again, she was extremely nice and apologetic and immediately sent someone over. She even compensated for the wait by not charging us for our shakes. She was the only good thing about that evening. The server assigned to our table was terrible! She was indifferent, seemed to be in a huge rush (no idea why given how empty the restaurant was) and just didn't care. She got our orders and went off. During our entire meal she came once to ask us how our meal was but never bothered to follow-up about our beverages or water refills. She did however come to our table several times to ask if she could clear our plates even when there was food on it. We had to tell her again and again that we were still working on our meal. I am not sure if her shift was coming to an end or she just didn't want us sitting there! It left a terrible taste in my mouth and I felt rushed and uncomfortable. Which leads me to 2) The Food - in a few words - terrible, under cooked and tasteless. Like I mentioned, I have been to the location several times so this was a first. The food came quickly and on eating it we realized why! Our burgers were under cooked (at least two people in our party including me got sick) and the buns were stone cold....right out of the refrigerator cold. Two of us ordered the spiked salted caramel shake, something I have had many times and enjoyed. This time, we were served a vanilla shake where the ice cream was not even blended thoroughly, barely a drizzle or taste of caramel and a shot of bourbon. That is not what i remember having the dozen other times I have been there. And most certainly overpriced for what we received. It was a good thing that the hostess had been gracious enough to not charge us for the shakes to compensate for the long wait. But it definitely ruined our meal.   The shadyside BRGR is in a prime location with a very discerning demographic and plenty of dinner options available. If I were them, I would not get complacent and make sure that both the service and the food quality is fixed. I am not sure if I am going back. Burgatory seems to be a better option if you are looking for a \"gourmet burger\" or even McDonald's for a decent meal!",

For 2 people we each ordered a burger and 2 different sides plus beer, the burgers came out and we asked where our sides were and they told us they were coming. We finally got the sides 10 minutes AFTER completely finishing our burgers and clearing our plates and when they came they didn't bring any napkins or silverware or plates for us to eat with. Then 5 minutes after giving us our sides the waiter came back and handed us a check without asking if we wanted anything else but went to the table next to us and asked if they wanted any shakes or anything and then offered to get them the check. I like the quality of the food, but I will never come back to this location, it was a very disappointing experience.",

    "text": "It was the first time eating here and we ordered fries, tots, Chachos, and a Regular Joe Burger. The Fries were amazing, loved the cheese topping. The Cajun Tots were GREAT too, but probably not the best match with the Chachos. I liked the twist using potato chips instead of tortilla chips in Nachos, but i wasn't expecting a barbecue type seasoning on the chips. It was really good at first, but after eating half the dish I had enough. The chips would have been better plain since it was topped with other delicious flavors of shredded chicken, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and another type of sauce. The burger was GREAT, very juicy and a good size and presentation.   I would give 5 stars but they lose one for service. The host seating us was nice, but the waitress seemed a little MIA. Normally I don't mind if they are busy with other tables/guest, but there was only 2 other tables and it was 4pm. When I finally saw her walking by I asked for togo boxes (and assumed she would bring the check). She brought two small boxes and then walked away. I waited for 5 more minutes for her to come back but didn't see her so I walked over to the host and asked for my check and a third box for the rest of my food. He said he would get the waitress for me, who came back 5 minutes later with another box and the bill and then quickly left again. You would think that it would be common sense to bring out a bag for my left overs considering I had three boxes, but guess it wasn't to her. We waited a little big for her to come back to get a bag, but just got annoyed and asked the host to get it.  I hope they split tips because aside from taking out order, the waitress wasn't very helpful.",

It was a cold night and we ended up sitting on the rooftop area that was being heated with propane heaters.  It was chilly as we sat next to the streetside in an open area but bearable.  I wasn't impressed with the burger that much. It was OK but nothing special.  For the price I was expecting something much better.  And there are no sides with your burger.  If you want fries expect to pay extra.    Overall, it wasn't bad-i'd eat here again if someone wanted to treat or I wanted to just blow some money.

It is very manly with lots of TVs on the walls, nice shades of blue and grey. Two huge all glass garage doors that open to let the warm weather in. There is a decent size bar area also, There is even a outdoor level on the second floor.   We were seated promptly and handed menus. We order our drinks. My wife and I got Cokes and our daughter got a chocolate milk. When our drinks came my daughter tasted her milk and said it tasted funny. My wife smelled and tasted it. It was spoiled! I'm glad I didn't get a milkshake if they are using spoiled milk! We flagged down the waitress and told her that our daughter's milk was spoiled. She apologized and said she tasted it before she brought it out. You tasted my daughter's chocolate milk?! Are you going to taste our burgers too? I knew she was full of it because if she did taste it she would have know it was spoiled! She replaced it with a Coke and all was well.   We already knew what we wanted as we looked at the menu already online but, the burgers we wanted weren't on the menu. Maybe they change ever so often.   They do offer kids meals. Don't ask me why they are not listed on the menu. For kids meals they offer a cheeseburger, grill cheese or hot dog which includes fries and a drink. My daughter got the cheeseburger and loved it. I believe the kids burger is the same size as a adult burger as she could only finish half of it.   My wife got the \"Cease & Desist\" which consists of a burger with American cheese, caramelized onions and 1000 island dressing. Pretty much their version of a Big Mac. I had the \"Button Buster\" which consists of a burger topped with braised beef short ribs, white cheddar cheese, bearnaise aioli and crispy onion rings. It was outstanding! I especially liked the bun as it was coated with butter and then lightly toasted.   My wife and I shared a order of BRGR Fries tossed with parmesan and herbs and topped with cheese whiz. They were really good as well.   Our waitress came over with drink refills without being asked I might add (which always gets you a few extra bucks in your tip from me), as we were eating to tell us that her shift was over at BrGr and she was going over next door to Spoon to start her shift there. And that we would be taken care of by her replacement. We sat waiting for a good ten to fifteen minutes for our check and a doggy bag. My wife flagged down a waitress would then got our replacement waitress to bring our check.   Other then our daughter's spoiled milk and taking forever to get our check we really liked BrGr and would have given it 5 stars. We will defiantly be back!",

I wouldnt order it again...i could only eat a small amount of house chips. They were too hard and very oily. I normally get the Parma fries which r way better. I still like Brgr i just didnt enjoy my food today.",

    "text": "On our second visit, our food and experience was much better.   We sat near the front in the armchair and couch section. The furniture is pretty worn but it's still comfortable and feels like home, although it's a little difficult eating over a coffee table. Service was a bit slow - and shouldn't have been - as there were not many people there for lunch.   My friend and I had the California Lovin', which was the best turkey burger I've ever had - and among one of the best sandwiches in general. The flavor combo was fantastic. My husband had the Shroom and, by the looks of his glazed-over eyes after he finished, it was fantastic as well. I will say, however, that my friend's order was wrong - a lettuce wrap instead of a wheat bun and a mysterious order of bleu cheese that he didn't ask for. My burger was also on the wrong bun. My son's grilled cheese didn't look special but he certainly chowed it down. Our table shared an order of the regular parmesan fries, as well as the sweet potato fries - and both were fried to perfection. I love the selection of craft sodas; and, my husband, ever the hophead, loves that they have Ballast Point's Grapfruit Sculpin - albeit for $8/bottle!  I really hope that they: revamp some of the interior, improve service, and consider lowering their prices ($65 for three adults and a kid at lunch is sort of pricey).  Overall, I'm still a fan of BRGR and plan to visit again.",

We asked where the meat was from and one of the servers went so far as to tell us that they got their meat from Curtze Farms. The menu says Curtze Meats. So because I am serious about ethical farming I called Curtze and they said they are a distributor and their meat is from all over the mid-west (where most American meat is from). It's not local at all they just deliver within Pittsburgh. It is just frustrating that they are using the term \"local\" in a dishonest way.  As far as the flavor of the food goes, it's ok.",

I was sitting right next to a pillar and could only move my right arm a few inches when eating my sandwich.    My burger was cooked just the way I like it and was very tasty, although the bun was rather generic and a little mushy.  They have a nice selection of craft beers, and I was able to find one that I had never tried before and it was delicious!  The only disappointing part of the evening was our server. She was not friendly at all and did not smile once through the entire meal, and did not even ask us how our meal was.  I would probably head back to Burgatory before I would come back here again.",

The service was slow and both dishes took a long time to get to the table.  But they have a wide range of burger choices and I can see why so many Pittsburghers frequent the place.  The burgers don't come with a side which is a negative, we didn't bother ordering a side like fries but I will try them the next time I go.    I'm not a big fan of burgers in the first place but love short ribs.  I might go back but not really anytime soon.",

Every burger comes loaded with stuff- waffles, foi gras,  pickled onion....The plain comes with lettuce tomato and onion.  Limites saucea.tried to get aioli that comes with one of the apps.The bartender told me truffle aioli is like marinara. Wtf.   The reason for the toppings became immediately clear on the first taste of the burger (which I ordered med rare and got med well) To hide a tasteless unseasoned beef patty.  With a slice of white cheddar cheese that could not have been thinner. Bacon that tasted like it had been cooked 2 days ago. Reminded me of the cheapest fast food burger to be had.  I cannot believe the high praise heaped on this place. Save your money and go to mcdonalds",

    "text": "The best way to describe BrGr is it's a young teenage boy trying to fit into his father's big boy pants. I have eaten at this place about five times now since it opened. Every time the experience has been inconstant. The burgers are good, but I've had better at places like Tessaro's. The service is questionable, particularly on the weekends, as you never know if the server will be attentive or not.  Also, I think their menu changes too often. Perhaps it's because they are trying to find the right menu mix. But it only adds to the inconsistency. For example, my friend had an amazing burger salad he told me I had to try. I came in the next day and it was already off the menu. Same thing with the sweet potato fries. One day they were there and the next they were not.  I had one of their specialty drinks at the bar. It was called \"Lemonade\" but it had vanilla vodka in it which overpowered the entire beverage. Nancy, the bartender, overheard me making a comment to my friend that the drink was not very good. She offered to fix it for me, which was a very nice gesture.  Much like a teenage boy, this burger bar is clumsy and awkward as it still tries to figure out its place in the new East Side dining scene. There is hope it will grow up and be the strapping young man we hope it will be. I want to like this place and hope it will become a neighborhood staple. It just needs time to figure things out.",

    "text": "BRGR is the new \"gourmet burger\" bistro opened by the owners of Spoon Pittsburgh.   The menu focuses, as you'd guess from the name, on burgers.  Not strictly limited to beef burgers, the place offers a variety of choices:  the turkey burger, for example, comes with green beans, stuffing, and cranberries, (\"It's a little too much like Thanksgiving on a plate\" said someone at my table).  There are salmon burgers, a lentil-based burger for vegetarians, a variety of beef choices, and at least one pork-based burger.  The pork-based alternative, the Banh Mi burger, was what I got.  A pork patty, pickled vegetables, and chicken liver pate, it reached (but did not go past) the limit of structural integrity.  It was creative, juicy, and I plan on going back for more.  Side dishes include french fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings, as well as coleslaw and a few other alternatives.  I'll follow up to this review once I've tried more of them.  The fries and onion rings were both excellent, and a side-order easily feeds more than one person.   Price-wise, you're looking at $7 - $9 (on average) per burger, plus a few bucks for a side dish.  This means you can go with a few friends, split a side dish and get in and out for around $10.  That's a good deal.  The drinks, particularly the alcoholic ice-cream shakes, can fatten up your bill like a corn-fed cow, costing around $8 each.  A friend of mine had one, and while they're not to my taste - I don't go for sweet drinks generally - they're fine examples of the booze-and-ice-cream category.  Criticisms: at least on the first day, when we ordered onion rings ahead of time they politely informed us that \"everything comes out of the kitchen at the same time.\"  That rule is not going to last long, especially if they expect people to be ordering drinks from their bar.  Hopefully they'll also realize it's a bit off-putting to be told you'll get your food on their schedule instead of yours.  I also deducted a point for their having a \"Kobe beef burger\" on the menu.  Come on, guys.  Your menu is strong enough without needing to engage in that sort of make-believe.    These criticisms, however, are fairly picayune.  The core message here is: they nail the gourmet burger bistro thing, they can execute on the food, and I plan on dining there often.",

Basically Button Buster substituting pastrami for the Braised Short ribs (which I thought was nuts). Even though it is clearly stated on the menu--no substitutions--they were kind enough to accommodate an eyelash-batting 17 year old girl. Interestingly enough, most of this burger went home in a take out box.   1 lamb burger (cooked medium--was my mistake. The burger was cold. I mean COLD) Loved the interesting curry and bits of feta, but was totally jealous of the steam coming off the others' burgers even on their last bites. I probably would not order this one again.  Also tried their fries with the truffle oiled cheeze whiz. Loved the fries, cheeze was ok. Also 2 orders of fried pickles. They are not spears or slices, but biggish whole pickles. Pickle-to-breading ratio a bit disappointing because they are whole, but nice crunch and flavors.  The girls (3) got shakes as dessert to go. I mooched a few slugs. WOW!",

Their tater tots are the best in the city, and some ofd the best I've ever had. I am a big fan of their turkey burger, and I feel like all of their burgers have been a little better lately. Plus they have a good vegetarian burger that can easily be made vegan, and they're sensitive to those needs to.  Cons: the atmosphere is a little too loud and unfocused. I think a place like Burgatory does a better job of balancing the casualness of the burger restaurant with the higher prices. And BRGR's beer selection is a little boring sometimes, and cocktails can be hit or miss. But overall, it's a great option, and I'm glad to see it's gotten better in recent months. Those tots, man...they're really terrific.",

    "text": "I've been twice now and have not had a good experience either time. First I tried the Kobe beef burger ($12) and was disappointed. The toppings were flavorful and good, but the burger itself was more medium well than the medium rare that I ordered. And then when I finished I realized I had paid $12 on a singular mediocre burger. This was over a year ago so I can't be more specific  Just today, I tried the \"Shrooms\" burger and found it utterly disgusting. In theory, all of the ingredients (brie, mustard, sauted mushrooms, and caramelized onions) are delicious. In execution, they sucked. First, my burger was dripping with oil. This was not the natural result of a nice fatty mix of ground beef but was (presumably) due to the mushrooms being sauted in copious amounts of oil. This resulted in me consuming a great deal of what I assume was canola oil considering it's lack of taste. They also used what tasted like an ultra-pasteurized creamy brie in lieu of the type of brie I prefer and call \"stinky brie.\" The mild flavor of this brie was lost in the burger and it's primary impact was imparting it's somewhat mushy texture. This would not have been a problem if the too-large bun wasn't soaked in grease, wrapped around a burger with no crust, or topped with sauted mushrooms and caramelized onions which both provided the contrasting moutfeel of... soft vegetables. I don't know if the burger was ill-executed or ill-conceived but it lacks flavor and there is absolutely zero crunch to this burger. Each mouthful was just a somewhat bland pile of mush that left a grease trail around my mouth.   Using raw red onion and blue cheese instead would probably help the flavor and texture, but the lack of char on the bun and patty is inexcusable. The mustard was the shining star in the flavor category but do you really want the best thing you can say about a burger to be, \"Well the mustard was good?\"",

Beer selection on tap was weak by local standards. Decor was sort of faux industrial arty, with Restoration-Hardware-style details and canned \"art photos\". They also do the scammy valet parking thing wherein the prime spots in front of the restaurant are out of commission so they can charge for parking. I hate that.  We are in this neighborhood often but would not be tempted to return.",

    "text": "I'm officially done with BRGR. The service is lackluster and they can't seem to make their food correctly.   When I moved to Pgh 2 years ago BRGR quickly became my favorite restaurant and I would eat there at least once a month. At first it was great every time. But after a few months, my experiences changed and not for the better. For about the past year or year and a half, my food has been wrong 9 times out of 10. I have a lot of allergies, so I am never able to order straight off a menu without adjustments, so I am used to some errors, but 90% of the time is ridiculous. And frequently my companions' food has been wrong as well, even when they ordered exactly as the item is listed on the menu. Additionally, not once have I been apologized to by a manager, even when I have mentioned to the server the frequency with which I have issues. In fact generally the servers themselves barely apologize.  I have stopped going to BRGR for the most part, but the other night it ended up being the most convenient option for a friend and I to grab a bite to eat. First my burger had an item on it that I am allergic to and had asked to have left off. They had to talk my burger back. When they brought it out again I cut into what should have been a well done burger and it was clearly pink. At that point I told the server that they could take it away and not replace it. Getting my order wrong twice is unacceptable. Once again, no apology from a manager and a half-hearted apology from the server. Additionally my companion's burger was ordered medium rare and although he ate it as it came, it was less less than rare. His burger was barely cooked. Then about 15 minutes after I sent back my second burger and clearly stated to two different bartenders that I wasn't interested in a replacement, one of the bartenders brought a new version of my burger telling me that there was a miscommunication and the kitchen remade my food anyway. They really can't get it together. I refused the burger because at that point my companion was done and I didn't want to spend any more time at BRGR. And who's to say it would have even been right? And if it had been correct, at that point I didn't want to pay for a burger it took them 3 times and the better part of an hour to get right.  Let's talk about the money for a minute. Obviously at this most recent visit, my burger was taken off my bill since I never even had a bite, but otherwise I have never had a discount of any amount or any sort of compensatory offer to make up for any of the times I have had a poor experience. Why should I keep giving BRGR my money when they can't get it together and they seem to not be bothered about that fact? The food is good when it is right, but it is not so good that I am going to keep taking that chance. But the ultimate thing for me: the overall service experience is ABYSMAL and I refuse to keep rewarding that with my business. And I will be telling my friends to stay away too.",

The light and sunny \"beertail\" was pretty tasty and would recommend it if you like wheat beers.  The bad.    Sadly BRGR's biggest failure was what it has centered its name and menu on.  Both my date and myself ordered a \"Fire in the Hole\" burger.  Despite coming with jalapenos (jarred), chipotle mayo and sriracha, it didn't even register on the heat scale with me or my date.  We both just found it to be kinda bland.  The burger itself was also tiny for what I would have imagined from a place called BRGR.  The beef patty was probably only 4 ounces or so, which I'm sorry, but for a $9 burger that doesn't even include fries (Yes you read that right, french fries are $4 extra).  The only positive thing to say about the burger was that it was correctly cooked as ordered.  I will gladly pay for small portions of good food, or even big portions of okay food, but they fail to deliver either.  There are several places in Pittsburgh which can offer both a tastier and bigger burger, for cheaper (Fat Head's, Burgatory come to mind).",

    "text": "I went to Brgr last night with some friends. Before heading out I checked the reviews here. Some good, some bad, but working in the industry you're going to run into that no matter where you go. Here's my take: I got there first and told the host a table for 3 with the possibility of 4. After I was sat I got notice that it was going to be 6. One of the reviews talked about having a hard time getting a table for 7 because they wouldn't move the tables. Well, when I said that I was sorry but the number was now six, the host told me no problem and slid a table over to accommodate me. It all depends on when you go and honestly who you get. I went on a slow Monday.   My server came over and started a nice conversation with me while I was waiting. I wanted to start off with a beer and then get into a spiked float and a spiked milkshake later on. She was able to give me her recommendations on her favorites and when I told her what I liked and didn't like she helped me narrow it down. I ordered some appetizers for when my friends did get there...homemade chips with their \"crack\" sauce and fried pickles. I ordered two of each and it was plenty for all of us at what I thought was a good price. Once my friends got there we ordered more drinks, I got the spiked cherry float, I like Maker's Mark so this was a good choice for me. It was a little strong but after a few sips I put more cherry soda in it and was able to dilute it enough. Right after that I asked for \"The King\" milkshake, I imagine named after Elvis' love for peanut butter banana sandwiches. This drink was so good I had to share it with my friends...after all was said and done I only got half of it. But I convinced one friend to get one too so I could have some of hers. I want another one right now.   As for a burger, I had the Bison Wing, bison meat and chicken skin covered in buffalo sauce and bleu cheese and a carrot-cole slaw. I could have done without the slaw, but that's just me. I still ate every bite. The meat was cooked exactly the way I asked for it and looking around, I saw that everyone else was enjoying their meal as well.   As soon as I got to work this morning, I told a couple guys that they had to bring their wives here and I am sure that I will be returning. So what I will tell you is that you should go. You're reading some reviews so you'll know what to expect and you can make your own opinion about the place. I, for one, like it.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review because I was very happy with BRGR's service, and I happen to think their food is pretty great, too.  A group of 8 friends was planning to invade BRGR on a Friday night, so we knew it would be a long wait.  A few of us went about 45 minutes early to secure a place on the waiting list and have a drink while we waited for our friends (we're pretty nice friends, don't you think?!)  Anyway, as luck would have it, our table was ready within the hour wait time that BRGR gave us, and our other friends were late!  We begged and pleaded with the lovely hostess to not give up her table, but rules are rules, and she had to (FYI - BRGR won't seat you until your entire party is present).  When all of our friends finally showed up, we were convinced that it was going to be another hour.  But, within about 15 minutes, another large table became available, and it was ours!  We were all really pumped, as there were some BRGR first-timers dying to try out the eats.  In addition, the hostess came over not once, but twice!, during our meal to make sure that we were happy with our meal.  Great job all around, BRGR staff.  And, because you want to know about the food ... I've been to BRGR a few times. The salmon burger is awesome, as is the one with carmelized onions (the name escapes me at the moment).  Fries are pretty standard, but still yummy.  The shakes are great!  And, I tried a sip of my friend's spiked root beer float, which I found to be creative and very tasty.  They also have a great selection of craft beers and a good happy hour special (1/2 price drafts, I think).  I'll be back to BRGR and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it!",

    "text": "from its name, \"BRGR bar\" sounds like a bar/lounge that sells specialty burgers. from the way BRGR treats its customers, it's a snobby expensive restaurant that turns away paying customers for no good reason.  first time i went there, i came with a group of 7 people for dinner and drinks. we waited for about 30 or 45 minutes patiently waiting for our table (as other smaller groups got sat). then we saw 2 tables open up right next to each other and we asked if they could put them together.  they said NO, but couldn't give us a good reason why (they actually said they just couldn't move the tables). there was no one behind us in line. the only tables that could accomodate us were still eating and clearly wouldn't open up for awhile. the two adjacent smaller tables just sat empty for 10-15 minutes when finally, we got fed up and argued with them until they realized they had NO good reason for why they couldn't put the tables together and finally sat us.  it seemed like they initially didn't want to do it b/c they are too \"good\" to move tables around to accomodate patrons.  the last time i went to BRGR, i tried to go there for drinks at around 9:30pm.  the restaurant area was mostly empty, 5-6 tables were open downstairs and who knows how many open on the patio.  no one was waiting in line.  we had a group of 4, but they refused to sit us because we only wanted drinks...they said we could sit at the bar (all the bar stools were taken). i said i \"might\" get an appetizer, but they still wouldnt sit us. we asked when we could get a table for drinks, they said around 11:30 or 12am.  two other larger groups came in at the same time, wanting to just sit and drink, and they wouldn't sit them b/c they weren't ordering food.  those groups left.  my group left and went down the road to mad mex (funny thing is, i actually ended up ordering food).    anyways, management needs to realize that they are supposed to be the more casual counterpart of Spoon. probably never going back.  for the other stuff:  -waitstaff service is good. -shakes are good. -the burgers are ehhhh and overpriced.",

    "text": "I went to Brgr for the first time a few days after it opened and have a mediocre burger and awful service.  I was really excited after reading reviews which implied that the service had been improved and that the menu has been changed.  I tried it again this past Friday night.    First off...the positives:  1.  The service (at the tables) has ABSOLUTELY improved!  We had a party of 8 and had very attentive waiters.  The bartenders still need some improvement.  2.  The rooftop seating is really beautiful.  This place gets an A+ for atmosphere.    Unfortunately, the negatives outweighed the positives:   1.  The bartender was still disapointing.  He made several mistakes, and one resulted in me paying for a $7+ bottled beer instead of the half off draft that I actually ordered.  He also forgot that my friend had already paid her tab and wanted her to pay twice.  2.  The menu is, in my opinion, way too small.  They only have a few shake combinations, which compared to Burgatory is very disapointing.  Also, they do not allow any substitutions on their burgers.  PLEASE PLEASE add a make your own burger!  3.  I have not had a beef burger at Brgr. I think if you have a turkey burger or a salmon burger on your menu, it should be high quality, just like your beef burgers.  If these nonbeef burgers are going to be afterthoughts, please don't have them as choices!  I had the turkey burger this time, and the burger was much smaller than the bun, with the toppings (avacado, mayo, sprouts) completely overwhelming the flavor of the turkey, which after I took everything off of it was actually decent.  Overall, I think that the food is a bit overpriced, and that the quality of the non-beef burgers are much lower than other burger joints in the area.  Harris Grill and Burgatory have much better turkey burgers, and Burgatory completely surpasses Brgr when it comes to choices.  I probably will not try Brgr again, but if I do, I will make sure to stick with beef.",
