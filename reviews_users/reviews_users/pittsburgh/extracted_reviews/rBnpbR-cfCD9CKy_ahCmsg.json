I've eaten here dozens of times over the last several years and my recent trip was just as expected - wonderful. The food is the best Thai in the city as far as I'm concerned. I ordered the green curry chicken pot, but also ordered won ton soup for my son to go. It's amazing and full of garlic. He would have disowned me if I didn't bring him some. The service is also always wonderful. I never feel rushed and the time between courses is just right.",

    "text": "Thai food for white people.  We ordered a 10/10 spice level and my three year old daughter ate it without difficulty (as did my in-laws who can barely handle the spice level of salt). So, we asked for some fresh Thai peppers and they brought sauces instead (red flag). When we again requested peppers they wanted to charge us an extra $1 for the spice in the food they failed to deliver in the first place.  Had the flavor profiles been more interesting I may have been much more forgiving, but it tasted like average, over-sauced Pittsburgh Thai.  The coup de grace was actually that we were charged an unearned 18% gratuity because we were a large group.  As a note, the corking fee for beer is $0.50/bottle, not $5 as some had previously mentioned.",

It's under the noodle soup section and I'm telling you it's the best broth you will ever have. I feel the same about their hot ginger tea, it's medicinal. The food is delicious, the service is great, the price is right. What more do you need when you're out to eat? Try both locations. Downtown is a little more upscale in its decor. Full bar in the back. Great date place. North side is quaint and fun too. Especially outside when the weather is nice.",

As for food, I think it really depends on what you order. For the first two times, it was good but not great. The third time, I came here with a few friends who really loved this place. We had the spring roll and papaya salad as appetizers. Both of them are pretty good, the papaya salad was really fresh and tasty. The texture of papaya combined with a little bit vinegar and peanuts stimulated my appetite. As for entrees, we had tom kha hot pot, soft shell crab, duck curry, crab fried rice, Spicy Basil Fried Rice, and some kind of tofu(?). The tom kha soup seems simple, but it's tasty if you like coconut. The spicy basil fried rice was so good that though I tried not to eat carbs, I still had quite a lot. Soft shell crab was a must for my friends, and they are good.",

They renovated the garden since the last time I was there about a year ago and freed up a lot of space. It was a little dark in our corner, but you should try and sit in the garden.  While everyone enjoyed the food, the spice levels seemed pretty arbitrary. Some 6's were spicy and others not at all. We also ordered an order of spring rolls that never arrived.   The Tom Yum soup was excellent. Highly recommended if you're headed to Nicky's.",

    "text": "Now, I'm no Thai connoisseur but in the last year since first trying Thai food, I've tried it just about everywhere I can in Pittsburgh and anywhere else I've ventured. I've also been obsessed enough to take Thai cooking classes and begin cooking at home. So, where did this little obsession begin? Nicky's Thai Kitchen.  My wife and I frequent Nicky's about one-a-week, on average, and it's currently one of our two favorite Thai places in Pittsburgh. We love the Smiling Banana Leaf, as well, but our proximity to Nicky's usually gives it the nod.  We've sampled just about every part of the menu at this point, and I can't say that I've ever been truly disappointed. The biggest food disappointment was probably the choo chee fish, but not because of flavor. The complaint is due to the new dish that they serve it in. The tables are just too small and cramped to deal with the giant fish-shaped metal serving dish they're using now.  One other potential complaint goes out to those of you with a lack of love for spicy food. My wife usually orders a spicy level of 3 or so, but we've had a few meals of hers come out in the 5-7 range. Considering how often we've eaten at Nicky's, I'd say your odds are still good, though, that you'll get what you want.  The only other complaint is that when it gets crowded, you REALLY feel it in the winter. Your personal space can feel non-existent depending on the layout of the tables, and the noise levels start to get a little too loud, but hopefully your food will make up for it. The warmer months ease this issue, as the outdoor patio - while also small - provides enough alternative seating to open up the floor and make for a more relaxed dining experience. Not to mention, the outdoor space is really nice.  As far as the food, I've tried an assortment of curries, noodle dishes, rice dishes, soups, and appetizers. I'm a huge fan of their fresh spring rolls. The rest of the appetizers aren't going to standout too much from the pack (all good...just pretty typical), but the fresh spring rolls are done really well, with a nice balance of flavors, and perfectly-softened rice wrappers. My favorite app there was the corn tods, but those were only on their specials menu for a while. They were excellent corn fritters that weren't too greasy and heavy. I hope they bring them back in the spring/summer.  The noodle dishes are all very good. My favorite is the spicy noodle, but the pad thai is an addictive go-to, as well. In fact, I could probably eat either dish every day of the week.   All of the curries that I've tried have also been excellent, as well as some of the chef specials. The Gaprow Lad Kao is a fun spicy basil & ground meat dish over rice with fried egg on top. It came as a recommendation from our server once, and it's become a regular dish of mine, although it's usually a little too much food. The other basil dishes are excellent, and their Tom Kha soup is very good. Recently, they've had crab fried rice on their specials menu, and it's incredibly good. When you think \"fried rice\", you tend to think of that heavy, greasy kind from your hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant or hibachi, but Nicky's pulled off a fried rice that's light, simple and incredibly flavorful with a nice amount of crab meat!  Stopping short of reviewing every dish I've tried at Nicky's, I'll just say that it's worth checking out if you're looking for good Thai in Pittsburgh. Nicky's is a nice BYOB spot that doesn't charge a corking fee, has nice, speedy service, a great outdoor area, and wonderful food that you'll likely become slightly addicted to.",

    "text": "I had my first Nicky's experience last night and thoroughly enjoyed it! This place is really cool and I will definitely be checking out their downtown location.  The restaurant itself is very small inside. I thought it was interesting that the host/hostess desk was situated in a spot with a full view into part of the kitchen. In a way, I guess this transparency should be appreciated--they have nothing to hide.  It was raining when my friend and I arrived, and we were quite confused when they asked if we preferred an inside or outside table. Once it was explained that the outside was covered, we decided to go with that option. No regrets! The garden area is really cute and unique. Lots of kitschy statues and a wide variety of plants made the area charming without being tacky. There was something oddly enjoyable about eating outside (under a roof) during a rain storm.  We started by splitting the crispy fried tofu which was served with a thick sweet and sour sauce. The portion was very generous (eight triangular pieces) and honestly I could have eaten the entire plate myself. They were delicious and I definitely recommend them!  Whenever I'm eating at a Thai restaurant for the first time, I like to order Pad Thai.. I guess it's sort of like a gauge for the quality of the restaurant. The portion was generous, but it was so good that I almost finished the entire thing (I was looking forward to having leftovers for lunch today, but just I couldn't stop!). They have a ten-point scale for spiciness, and at our waiter's recommendation I went with a four. It was fairly spicy--I could probably do a five next time, but it was spicy enough for my liking (and I DO like spicy foods quite a bit).   The place is BYOB and the prices are reasonable. I'm not in the North Side too often but this place alone makes it worth the trip!",

Next time I went, I told the waitress that last time I ordered, I said \"Thai hot\" and got bland. She seemed surprised and well, maybe the last waiter just didn't hear me? Ok, so, just in case the last waiter didn't hear me and they actually do know how to do something other than bland, I told her an 8 out of 10 on the spice scale. Yeah, no. I poured in some chili powder and ate it.   I usually order medium spice at my local Thai place in Maryland. Nicky's hottest setting is like eating ramen noodles by comparison.  If this is the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, I'm really glad I don't live in this city anymore, because clearly Pittsburgh doesn't know Thai.",

We wondered into this little Thai restaurant this afternoon and we left amazed.  We walked in the front door, a little confused by the entryway that looked like we were now in someone's home.  We were seated in the small but cozy dining area that seats about 30.  The waitress was quick to come over and grab us a couple drinks.  We love crab rangoons and got an order asan appetizer.  She ordered Beef Pad Phet, and I got their Beef Pad Thai.  Within 5 minutes of entering the restaurant, we both had drinks, and our fresh rangoons were in front of us.  Our favorite rangoons to date came from a small Chinese restaurant in china town in Chicago and these blew the china town rangoons out of the water.  They were light, but PACKED with flavor.  We had barely finished the rangoons when our food arrived.  Everything was delicious! We have had some Thai food in the past so I wouldn't consider us experienced by any means, but this was incredible.  After our delicious meal, they boxed up the rest of our lunch and brought the check.  The food was incredible, but I was even more amazed by the great and quick service.  We were done eating and the check was paid within 20 minutes.  I have never had more quick and thorough service anywhere.  Overall we would rate Nicky's a 5/5 for the cosy atmosphere, great food, and even better service.",

    "text": "I always go for the Green Chicken Curry to see what a Thai restaurant can do. It's a dish easy enough to make if you're authentic and know what you are doing, and it is easy enough to screw up to reveal your True (non-) identity!  Unfortunately, for this place, the latter was True... I want to give these guys a fair review, but I have to do this within the frame of my past experience. In that, I think 2 stars are more than appropriate:  The entrance reminded me of how you get into those really cheap backpacker hotels. It is a victorian style house, with a stair case right behind the door leading upstairs. Downstairs, the probably once nice looking wood flooring is replaced with off-white bathroom floortiles. Walk all the way inside, do a U-turn, and then you are in the restaurant - in two rooms that were once sitting and front room of the house. The layout is not my problem, but it is the feel of the place. It really looks more like a day spa than a restaurant, and the floortiles everywhere are not helping. Also the scent candles don't help - especially since I nearly torched my jacket by one of them standing right next to my chair on the floor.  Weird also is the staff. They appear to be locals that own the place, and they were definitely not Thai! The only people that look Thai were barely visible in the kitchen. But maybe they were not Thai. What do I know.   But what do I know - maybe, I thought, this place looks odd, and the people are not authentic, but maybe they can cook up a storm. Well.... I ordered the typical serum of truth - Green Chicken Curry! And what did I get? A salmon colored vegetable soup with chicken! Dare I ask - I thought - and dare I did. Upon which a blushed response came that indeed, this was the green curry. Also the rice - not so good looking.  However - and this is why I gave 2 stars, and not one - the food actually tasted pretty good! Also, the sticky mango rice at the end, not bad.  Still, for San Francisco prices, with $10.50 for a curry, and no liquor license at this resto I am not sure it would be my recommendation...",

    "text": "Atmosphere - I've only had takeout in the past and this time I made reservations for the back patio filled with green plants and covered with umbrellas so I didn't even need my sunglasses on this sunny day. The tables are close together and the serpentine entrance path is almost single file.  Service - other than having to overcome the language / accent barriers on the reservation the service was in line with other family-run ethnic restaurants with good intentions though lacking in a higher end restaurant polish this doesn't detract for me.  Food - ubiquitous for a reason the pad thai had peanut flavor without the sometimes too sweet ketchup sauce found too often - delicious. The spicy noodles had lots of fresh basil cooked into the spicy noodles and the tofu tasted fresh and did not have any off flavors from the oil which indicates fresh oil. The spring rolls are simple and vegetarian and cut into sushi (maki) style rolls which makes them easy to eat. The fried egg rolls were thin cigar style rolls with a small amount of vegetable filling. Overall, wonderful Thai food and that's what it is all about.  I'd be happy to go back and try more offerings especially the soups on a colder day. For me I'd choose take-out or the patio seating.",

I wanted to like this place a lot but a las its so-so. There isn't a lot of flavour  with any of their curry dishes and they ARE EXTREMELY RUNNY. Maybe its me? Maybe I need to up the spice level a bit? I don't know but I was hardly impressed with either their Yellow Curry or their Pineapple Curry.   The staff is super friendly though!",

When I was seated inside the restaurant, it was so loud I couldn't hear our private conversation at all. We had to yell at each other to be able to talk. On the other hand, I actually liked when I was seated in the outdoor garden. The ambiance is quite nice, and the decor is cute. However in this restaurant, the space is so tight I could hear everyone else's conversation as if I was sitting with all of them. It was not a very nice setting for a date. The food was just okay. Pad Thai was probably the only dish I liked enough to have it again next time, if I ever go back. Another curry noodle dish was way too salty, I packed the whole thing and had to eat it with white rice.  On top of all this, the service was slow every time I went to this restaurant. Mediocre food, noisy environment, pricey dishes, and slow service - why would I every go back there? There are so many other thai places in Pittsburgh that are better than this one.",

Well I wasn't let down at all...in fact impressed - this is bar far the 2nd best Thai I have ever eaten! Their food is fit for a king and is extremely authentic.

I still stick to my favorites, the Massaman Curry and the Pad Thai. Notable things left out of my prior reviews is that every few days they put real flowers into the table vases and switch the arrangements each time. There has been a serious effort designing the interior walls and decorations, but the place can feel really cramped on busy days as the tables are really close together. Each dish comes with a flower made out of carrot, and a crab/cheese ragoon placed on top, which is a nice touch. There is a nice looking outside dining area with a little fountain and lots of canapes. Some of the Thai servers should smile and be a little more happy, but you can expect several water refills throughout the meal. Each lunch dish comes with a salad or soup. I tried the soup once and wasn't a fan, but the salad has a really nice dressing. They could improve by using a more green salad and skipping the iceberg, however. Hopefully they will keep their lunch prices about the same ~$8, because I have to commute from downtown to get here for lunch and i would hate for them to stop making it worth my effort.  Food Quality/Taste = 5 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 3 Stars (could be more, but I don't leave starving) Price = 4 Stars Service = 5 Stars Experience with Staff = 4 Stars Decor = 5 Stars  Enjoy!",

I couldn't hear the person I was with sitting across from me. The food.... nicer than some.. but mediocre flavors. The \"fresh\" flowers were not so fresh. The basil chicken had copious amounts of water at the bottom of the plate totally diluting the sauce and adding a tinny flavor to the dish. Won't go back.

They recently opened another downtown location but the Western Avenue Nicky's will always hold a special place in my heart, especially in warm weather when the Zen Garden around back is open for dining with it's beautiful foliage, Buddhas, and trickling water fountains. You forget you're on the Northside!  Nicky's seafood dishes have won my heart over the years so much that I pretty much order whatever seafood dish is on their specials list. In the summer it's often Seafood Phad Cha and I'm always delighted to see that because its my favorite one ever - the sauce is amazing! Their sauces are always so flavorful with lots of fresh veggies & delicious fresh seafood like shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, tilapia and often some crazy corkscrew looking piece of seafood that I can't identify but thoroughly enjoy! Recently the special was Chili Mango Seafood which had a slightly sweeter sauce with the addition of the fresh mango. You can order your preference of heat from 1-10, and I always go 6 - I enjoy a good kick!  Since 2 of our family members are vegetarian, we've probably ordered every vegetarian appetizer they offer over the years and they are all delightful. There is often a sampler vegetarian option on the specials menu. You also can't go wrong with the veggie spring rolls or samosas.  Nicky's on Western Ave. is also BYOB & typically there's no corkage fee.  Love, love, love Nicky's!",

Not only is this frustrating for vegetarians/vegans, it could cause someone allergic to take a trip to the hospital.  We also waited 20 minutes from paying for the food to getting our credit card back. I finally had to walk up to the front and ask for it back. I would give one star but I added one back because we asked for a manager, who was helpful in finding us something to eat (we had to choose from a few options, none of which were on the vegetarian menu, and ask specifically for no fish/oyster sauce). Another waiter came over and said he heard we were vegan and was also extremely helpful, as he was also vegetarian. The food was delicious in the end and the atmosphere was great.",

Service is great and food comes out fast. Their papaya salad is not bad... but not the greatest. I've also tried their pumpkin curry which is on the sweeter side from the natural sweetness that the pumpkin brings. I didn't like that too much. Oh... I've also had the Basil stirfry with tofu and that's yummy. This is a street parking kinda place so if you come after 6pm M-S or anytime Sunday, you can avoid paying for parking. I've never had trouble finding parking. This will probably be my once a week place if I can help it. :D",

    "text": "I love Thai food, my favorite in Pittsburgh is the Smiling Banana leaf in Highland Park, this is a close second.  I have been here 2 times for lunch.  I have eaten on the patio both times which feels like you are in a beautiful tropical garden nowhere near Pittsburgh.  I had the Pad See Ew and the Rat Na/Lat Na/Lad Na.  The Rat Na is not on the lunch menu however the chef was nice enough to make it since they weren't super busy.  I do have to warn you that they do NOT mess around with spice.  I normally get a 7 at most place, but at Nicky's I get a 4.  I got a 5 the first time and needed extra napkins because my nose kept running.  So please be mindful of the spice levels here.  Overall I think this is a wonderful Thai restaurant, great service, and delicious authentic Thai.",

Man, I wish I would have got a level 2 or 3. At level 0, their pad thai is REALLY sweet. But otherwise, their service is EXCELLENT. My water glass was always full and the staff was ridiculously friendly and warm.",

    "text": "Winner Winner REAL Thai Dinner.  Anybody who has had authentic Thai can attest to the fact that Nicky's is hands down Pittsburgh's most authentic Thai food.  Don't be swayed by the entrance or the shady North Side around it Nicky's is a diamond in the ruff.  Nicky's does it right. What is right? Well ultimately it's subjective but my opinion matters damnit. Sooo soak this in. BYOB to begin with bottle and corking fees on the weekend, but completely reasonable and not at all minded.(.25 a bottle for beer, not sure for wine)  AMBIENCE: Their outdoor seating area takes you outside \"the city\" and transports you to Phuket island...Not really. But its a lovely little atmosphere perfect for dates and what not, but certainly no good if it's a hot afternoon(in which case you should stay inside where it is air conditioned) It really does have nice ambience with water features and thai-ish decor.  APPS: Now the important stuff. Apps are great. Crab Rangoon, Crunchy Spring rolls papaya salad. All perfect and not all that expensive. Each cooked to perfection and with the flavor and taste you ultimately are looking for in a good app with actual thai roots. Their chicken noodle soup is also delightful and garlicy with flat rice noodles. A nice twist on an otherwise 'american' soup.  MAIN: For the main dish the Red, Green, Yellow blue whatever curries(had them all) are ALL great. Chicken, beef, shrimp or seafood you can't go wrong. The complex spices of indian cuisine collide in a blissful manor with the far east as Thai food is expected to do and you are presented with a delightful filling and delicious dish. Their spice scale is as you should expect and they are darn good and gauging how spicy you want something. Their \"brown\" rice is beautiful and purple and beautifully presented so don't be alarmed when you ask for brown and it comes out purple.  Drinks: Well you can bring your own alcoholic beverages but their thai iced tea and iced coffee are made the real way, the way they do in Thailand and for a reasonable price since you'll want to have two most likely.  Overall: GO HERE! it's great for dates and good for familys. The staff is friendly and forgiving of indecisiveness and alterations to your specifications. Compliments to the chef and Nicky for opening a great authentic Thai food restaurant in Pittsburgh.",

A con was that we were seated at a table for two with the table umbrella exactly in the middle, which was cemented to the floor tho we just shifted our seats over.  Food errs on the cheap side for dinner generally speaking - $10 - $20 for entrees and under $10 for apps. Nicky's Thai Kitchen does not skimp on the portions. We ordered fresh rolls and I ordered the Beef Phad Phet. Delicious. Waiter was friendly and checked in on us periodically.

When we were approached at the host stand, the first person we spoke to told us to \"hold on\" while she checked to see if they were \"still open.\" A second person came up to us and expressed that it was fine for us to come in and be seated for lunch. We both were very understanding that we had arrived very close to closing time, and said we would have no problem waiting until the kitchen re-opened at 5 and we would come back. The worker assured us that it was no problem.  Upon being shown to our table, I sat down to look at the menu, and my boyfriend went to use the restroom. As I was looking over the menu and waiting for him to return, a third, very rude, worker came up to me with a pitcher of water and said \"how many of you are there?\" I let her know there would be 2 of us for lunch. She very disgustedly responded with \"you need to order right now, the kitchen is closing!\" I told her that my boyfriend was in the restroom, and neither of us knew what we were going to order, but as soon as he returned, we would decide and let her know.  Once he joined me, we were almost instantly approached by a different worker, and once again we were practically forced to make a decision about what to order. Our food was dropped off at our table, as well as the check at the same time.  While we were eating our meals, nearly every employee in the restaurant came out into the dining room with their own meals to eat. This wouldn't have bothered me, however, our empty water glasses were ignored while they ate their own lunches.  I couldn't enjoy my meal whatsoever, and actually ended up leaving over half of it there because I wasn't offered a to go container. After our check was paid, 3 completely new workers came up to our table at the same time clearing everything on our table, including the vase of flowers.They were doing everything possible to get us out of there!  This was a complete disappointment, and such horrific display of business practice. I will not be returning, and most certainly will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone!",

Here I ordered the Lhad Na with tofu and at a number 8 on their spicy scale.  Very good.  However, I feel like they didn't give me a real \"8\" on their scale, because I'm white.  My asian companions ordered 8's and their dishes were notably spicier.    Nonetheless, very good food!  I can't wait to come back.  Definitely the best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh.",

Unfortunately, the night I went was chilly and rainy so we chose to sit in the dining room. We were seated next to the patio door, which 6 out of 7 servers were not courteous enough to close as they entered/exited.   The dining room itself is one giant rectangle of a room, decorated as you would expect with Thai art. It's brightly lit and extremely loud when the room is full, as it was that night. All in all, the indoor dining room does not make for an intimate dining experience.  Lastly, the service was good, but the staff were slightly over zealous filling water glasses; there's a fine line between being attentive and annoying, and that night they edged towards the latter.  Would go again, but would choose the patio.",

    "text": "For a man who claims to love Panang curry as much as I do, how on earth did I resist their special of softshell crab panang curry?  I can totally see why this place has gotten the high reviews, it's cozy, the service is good, and they even have an elderly Thai woman working in the kitchen (can't get much more authentic than that)!  Instead of the softshell panang, I went with their \"signature\" mixed seafood pad thai.  As soon as I saw it.....smelled it, I immediately regretted my decision.  When you think of ideal seafood, you might think of pristine scallops and shrimp, and crabs gently plucked out of the crystal blue waters surrounding, say, Fiji.  The seafood in this Pad Thai looked like it was dragged in off the coast of New Jersey, pulled up in oily nets and left to sit in the smog filled air.  It was not good.  To be honest, the shrimp wasn't even edible, and the pungent taste kind of scared me off from the rest of the large white \"seafood\" chunks on my plate.  The rest of the flavors were decent, although I got absolutely NO heat from my medium spice preference.  Don't get me wrong, I'd definitely come back to this place, and I'm sure it's great, just avoid the seafood pad thai.",

    "text": "Best. Thai. EVER.  This small, neighborhood delight is unassuming at first glance. Make no mistake about it, those chefs in the kitchen you see upon first walking into Nicky's are hard at work, creating not only the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, but perhaps anywhere. The dining room is small but nice enough, but the real treat occurs when the weather is nicer and you move your dining experience to the patio. Beautiful foliage, babbling fountains, subtle twinkling lights, glass top tables with protective umbrellas...it's what I imagine dining in a secret garden would be like if Buddah was watching. And then, your food arrives.  The spring rolls are light, tasty, with just a hint of crunchy peanuts. They are served with an amazing sweet dipping sauce. The samosa are incredible, lightly fried, and in addition to the traditional fillings such as potatoes, peas and carrots, they have added a very welcome layer of...pumpkin. Any samosa I've had since trying these treasures has fallen way short. Now, I'm the kind of girl who orders Pad Thai pretty much everywhere I go. I can't seem to stop myself. Nicky's Pad Thai is in a whole different league. The plate that is presented to you is vibrant, fresh, the tofu is always perfectly cooked, beautifully sauced, and the portions are definitely enough to provide lunch the following day. After trying the Pad Thai, it took me probably 5 visits to Nicky's to finally branch out and try something else on their ample, tasty menu. Other standout dishes for me? Definitely the yellow curry, the spicy noodle dish (rice noodles, cabbage and a yummy spicy basil sauce), the kao soy (yellow curry remix with rice noodles, pickled cabbage, tofu. My new go-to dish).   There is another Nicky's location in Verona, and we have gotten take out from here on a few occasions. The menu is the same. The quality and consistency of the food, however, is not. It's decent Thai food, but certainly not what I've come to expect when I think of the extraordinary flavors of Nicky's.  This is a special, wonderful restaurant. The service I have had here has always been nothing short of stellar. I will continue to frequent here and hope that they continue to be successful. I just hope with all the new people that discover this North Side gem, there continues to be a table on the patio for me.",

Come during the summer, and sit outside in their back patio, which is like a little slice of Thailand tucked away into a quiet pocket of Pittsburgh. The service is very nice, and the food is wonderful. Our favorites so far have been the mango tilapia (tilapia is usually just meh, but this is legitimately good!) and the pad see eu. The sticky mango rice is divine for dessert.  I'm not sure how this place makes money during winter, because it doesn't seat a lot of people. So, I bet the line for this place can get long. But, come anyway! It's truly a great little gem.  Note - the thai ice tea is a bit on the watery side for us. But in no way did it deter us.",

    "text": "I ate here this past Wednesday evening with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  Our dining companions got there before us and had a 5 minute wait before being seated outside on the patio.  Whenever we arrived we had a hard time finding them since no one really stepped up to ask us anything but we eventually did. The patio here is actually a really cool place.  It has a jungle-esque feel with plants all over the place with a fountain in the corner as well as a large amount of umbrellas to block the sun and space heaters for the winter.  It took about 20 minutes after we were seated to order and my girlfriend and I decided to start off our meal with the crispy tofu.  It came served on a plate with what was supposed to be a sweet and sour sauce although I believed it to be a sweet chile sauce.  In any case I really enjoyed it.  The tofu itself was fried up nicely and the outside tasted great.  However it seemed to made with semi firm tofu whenever I would have much preferred extra firm.  Whenever we finished up our appetizers we were once again subjected to another long wait before our meals came.  For my entree I ordered the duck curry (Thai spicy) which was a regular menu item.  Confusingly there was also a grilled duck curry special that was $6 more that I did not see but ended up getting.  It came out in the normal coconut and red curry broth with tomatoes, peppers and a side of jasmine rice. The duck was actually perfectly cooked and not greasy at all which made me happy to have gotten the special.  The curry also had a good flavor and was slightly spicy but not Thai spicy in my book.  We had originally been thinking about ordering dessert as well but after the long waits we decided to cut our losses and head home without it.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  The food by itself was easily 5 stars, now if their service can only match the food.",

    "text": "I've heard positive things about Nicky's Thai Kitchen downtown, and when I was checking the website for their weekend hours was super excited to discover their northside location with an outside patio! Whaaaat a disappointment. If you don't read this further, Pusadee's Garden on Butler has everything Nicky's has +10000, go there instead!  I was relieved when I got a reservation for 2 outside on their patio on a Saturday night calling as late as 5 to make it, and that was the most rewarding part of our experience! When we arrive (the area is really quaint around it), we stood infront of the hostess table/ entry to the kitchen for at least 8 minutes while so many servers bustled infront of us. We hate to be the rude people who butt in, but it really did make us feel uncomfortable standing there without being acknowledged! A simple \"hey!\" would have totally eliminated the awkward situation. Eventually someone said \"YA?!\" to us and I explained our reservation, they crossed a name which might have been mine, and we were told to wait 10 minutes until they were ready. The wait wasn't long, but once we were seated on the patio (nothing compared to Pusadee's..very loud, a little tacky, just overdone) it was another 10 minutes before someone came over and just flat asked \"Ready?\". We ordered our app (6 spring rolls the size of a string cheese) and it took another 15 minutes and talking to 2 separate people to get our bottle open (BYOB 5$ on weekends). The food came via some other server, 15 minutes passed, and a different one came and tried to take our plates when we were still eating. The food itself was decent at best, the pad thai was wet like other people have described and the sweet and sour chicken was food court caliber. Between the poor/ lack of service, the mediocre food, and the overwhelming patio, we won't be going back. We will appreciate Pusadee's a lot more our next time around.",

This place is only half a mile away from my North Shore office.  It's tucked away on a beautiful block of Western Avenue.  I would have driven by this place had it not been for my GPS alerting me to the fact that it was on my right!  I lucked out and got a parking space right in front of the entrance - street parking only, no lot, so factor that in to your lunch break if you are like me and on a tight schedule.  I got there about 12:45pm so it wasn't quite the lunch rush.  Good thing because there are just a few tables for dine in service.  They were doing a very brisk takeout service.  I went with my old Thai standby: - Pad Thai with chicken and tofu, medium spice  It was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious.  I asked for the spice tray which was very comprehensive: Sambal, Thai chiles in fish sauce, dried red pepper flakes and something else I couldn't identify (sugar? that doesn't make sense but that's my guess).  The Pad Thai was very tasty without it tasting like a ton of MSG.  It even came with soup (chicken rice today) and a little crab rangoon.    The damage including tip was right at $15 (Pad Thai plus $2 extra for tofu and $2 for a Diet Coke).  A little pricy for lunch, but well worth it.",

Since I just moved to Pittsburgh, i was unaware they closed at 3 and open back up for dinner, so i was unable to sit on the patio and had to box up my food to go... my fault. Seems like a really great little restaurant though and plan to spend many summer days eating pas thai on their lush back patio. neighborhood is really adorable too.",

I obviously didn't try every ones, but I'd like to say the vegan duck curry was stupid delicious.  The vegan duck was definitely canned seitan, but the curry and veggies were amazing.  They will slice each dish to your tolerance, and I went mild cuz I had a drive back to Ohio, bit would definitely consider returning if their weren't so many other places I'd like to try in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "At long last I had a chance to eat at Nicky's - I am REALLY late on this one, aren't I? - which has always been praised by friends as a great place to eat tasty Thai food. And I have to agree!  Admittedly walking in to this place is a little funny since it was built in a classic old Pittsburgh home - so, compact in the front but long overall. You have to walk down a long hallway towards what just looks like their kitchen to get to their seating area, which is on the other side of the wall in that long hallway. From there we were seated in their lovely looking if not a little small dining area, had our orders taken quickly, and also got our food fairly quickly. It was definitely a pleasant dining experience.  Firstly, can I just say that I'd come back here just for a glass of their jasmine green iced tea? It was infused with something - Milk? Cream? Seriously message me if you know what it was! - and the result was a really unique and absolutely delicious beverage. Don't worry, though, the food's good too. I enjoyed a fantastic order of Pad Thai that can be summed up in one word - yum! Everything was cooked, spiced and mixed perfectly, and after some of my past experiences with Thai food it was a relief to enjoy a meal that was tasty even though I ordered a mild meal. Thankfully Nicky's is not one of the places that confuses spiciness with flavor!   Oh, and just to make everything even better, my meal (and my friend's salad) both came with a single crab rangoon on the side. Seriously, more places need to do this! I adore crab rangoon but ordering a whole appetizer can be a bit much sometimes. This was the perfect compromise and it added yet another layer of flavor to my meal.  I am now 100% dying to return here, explore the rest of their menu, and eat in their gorgeous outdoor seating area out back. Is it too early to start a to do list for summer of 2015? Well, even if it is, eating at Nicky's is on the list now - and hopefully I can come back before then!",

    "text": "Yes yes yes yes! Those are the first words that come to mind after my experience at Nicky's. This is one of those restaurants I've been dying to try for so long. Not only does it have a great Yelp reputation, but many friends have tried it and say nothing but positive things.   I arrived around 5:30PM and I was one of the only tables in the dining room. By the time we left, nearly every table was full. The dining room was quite small and sort of awkward, but the food definitely made up for that. I know Nicky's is known for it's beautiful patio section, but unfortunately I visited during a snowfall. Bummer.  The food was incredible. Not only was the presentation beautiful, but the quality and taste were superb! I'm not too much of an ethnic food fan, but Nicky's has me making an exception. I ordered the cashew chicken dish and ate every last bit. Everything from the veggies, to the sauce to the meat was excellent. It definitely had a bit of a zing to it (they ask you how spicy you would like your dish beforehand), but I wouldn't have it any other way! Two meals and a tip came out to be around $40. Not bad considering how much food you get.   Service was decent and we didn't have to ask for more water as they were already a step ahead. Oh, btw-- It is BYOB! Nothing better than that. There is a $5 corking fee.   I can't wait to return and check out their patio. Now with the weather breaking up, I'm sure I'll be visiting soon!",

Nicky's Is that friend.   Up the front stairs, step in a long narrow hallway, bump and shuffle to the teeeeeny hostess area and put your name in, call ahead if you're bringing you're crew.   When your name is called, you get to enter the small dining area.  The size of my moms living room.  Who cares?  I'd stand in a coat closet with my arch nemesis if it meant I could eat this food.   It's noisy, tight, warm and fabulous.  The food was pretty spot on. There was 6 of us, once seated, all comfortable. We had some wine (BYOB no corkage fee except on weekends!!), and had a fabulous 2 hour dinner party.   We did a sampling of appetizers.   Fresh rolls were good, they had tofu in them. Would've liked to have had an option for shrimp.  I'm pretty sure they were pre-made and stored in fridge which isn't the worst thing in the world....except it's a FRESH roll.  I know fresh rolls, my friend. Anyway, still tasty.   Dumplings. Flavorful, a little chewy.   Crab rangoons. Good.  Fish cakes. Good.   Chicken satay. Great.   Tom Kah soup. The bomb. A nice spicy sour base broth with a lovely lemongrass balance with lots of fresh veggies and seafood. We got the large pot to share...an okay size. I'd get this again in a heartbeat.   I had the garlic chicken/mild spice, delicious. I'd def go back for it. Smooth sauce with rich flavor, snap peas/chicken/mushrooms.   My dinner companions were pleased as well.   Portions were good. Not ridiculously big but ample.   Not great for kids.   Outdoor seating are looked nice, but it was just to hot outside. Lots of plants and a pergola.    I had mango sticky rice for dessert. Perfection.   I will alert you that I am a Thai food fanatic. So any Thai food makes me happy. But this ranked above average.",

However, I will say that I had a much better experience at the North Side location. We started the meal with the Thai toast which I would highly recommend. The pairing with the dipping sauce is a great combo and it has so much flavor.   As my entree I got the Pad See Eaw and it had the perfect amount of sauce. It wasn't swimming and it wasn't lacking in sauce like some other dishes I've had there.   In comparison to the other location I think this location is set up a little better with more room between tables. I don't feel like I'm eating dinner with the people next to me or like I'm going to elbow them as I try to leave my table. The waiter was also very nice and didn't bother us when we sat for a while to finish our bottle of wine which was nice.",

Since it's still pretty extensive but with lower prices overall (plus a soup or salad with most items), there's no reason not to! We chose the rice soup to start with, and it was so hearty, being seasoned with some herbs and spices and some pieces of meat. Our entrees were the phad see eaw and wild curry. The former was made just as well as you can find in many other Thai restaurants. The wild curry came with an assortment of different vegetables; it was interesting because it lacked coconut milk and was more like a spicy soup. They also came with a crab rangoon each, which I found kind of weird, but it was an interesting bonus. The food here tends to be on the sweeter side, so that's something to keep in mind.",

Get there before 11:30 or after 1 and you should be ok. The portions are big enough that I can generally take home leftovers. The soup or salad prior to the meal is great. I highly recommend the salad with the pineapple dressing. My mouth is watering thinking about it. I kind of rotate between a few different dishes. Phad Thai, Phad See Eaw, and the pineapple curry.  The level of spiciness changes every time I go. I can get a 3 one visit that tastes like a 0, and a 3 the next visit and it's more like a 7. If you don't mind being surprised you'll be fine. The atmosphere at lunchtime downtown is fast paced so you never really have a chance to chat with the servers.  One other recommendation.... go to the northside location in the summer and sit outside. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "The hubby and I have been wanting to try Nicky's Thai Kitchen for years now. I recently had an amazing experience at Nicky's in Downtown and had been really wanting my husband to try Nicky's. Since we were leaving for NYC the next day, I decided Nicky's would be delicious yet affordable for New Year's Eve dinner.  Though I thought it may be silly (since I didn't imagine Nicky's being a popular NYE spot), I did make reservations. However, the restaurant was full the entire time we were there! It was a lot smaller than I had expected, and my hubby and I were packed at a small table between two other couples.  We started our meal with a glass of Riesling - gotta love BYOB! - and some appetizers, the Crab Rangoons and Thai Samosas. The Thai Samosas were delicious. I loved that instead of being filled with regular potatoes that the lightly fried pastry was stuffed with sweet potatoes. Crab Rangoons are a favorite of mine, and these were literally the best I've ever had. I could drink that crab meat and cream cheese mixture. So yummy!  I ordered my typical Pad Thai for my entree. It was tasty, but not quite as delicious as the Pad Thai that I had gotten a couple weeks prior at the downtown location. I was a little disappointed... once you've experienced a 10/10 on the Pad Thai scale, having an 8/10 is a little bit of a letdown.   Though we were stuffed, I just had to try one of their desserts. My husband and I split the Black Stick Rice with the Pumpkin Custard. I immediately felt cheered up... it was incredible. I am often disappointed by desserts in Asian cuisine due to their lack of sweetness, but this dessert was the perfect balance of sweet and savory.   Overall, I had a very nice experience and enjoyed my NYE dinner. I look forward to coming back again!",

I ordered the green curry noodle dish (which I've had numerous times at different Thai restaurants) and it was delicious here! I was happy the server gave me the warning that all curry dishes are rated around a 3 to begin with because of the spice in the sauce.

Their back patio is extremely nice, great atmosphere with Thai decor and gardens. Everything is always great and I have yet to find a better yellow curry, anywhere. Their tofu is always spot on too. In addition to everything being so delish and consistant, their prices are excellent. Lunch is especially cheap and comes with soup or salad.  They are BYOB Pros:  Summer, great outdoor seating. cheap excellent quality food Cons: Always busy and quite loud inside",

They all heard my clear order, which I repeated at the end of our phone conversation, but when I arrived and checked my order it was a mess. 1 entree was missing, 1 entree had the wrong protein & 1 appetizer was missing.  Unfortunately, they swiped our credit card right before we thought to look through the order to make sure it was all there (tip from fellow yelper on this same restaurant) so they charged us for the wrong entree and the missing app.   When I politely asked that she remake the entree with the wrong protein she told me I was wrong, that's what I ordered and I had to pay for it, but they would make me a new one with a new price.  Worst customer service I've ever encountered and I will never go back there. Also, glad it was a to-go order because the place is really cramped and loud.",

    "text": "Nicky's is a wonderful option in the North Side, located in a brownstone on Western Ave, just a couple blocks from Heinz Field. Parking on the street is metered, but usually easy to find (unless it's game day, of course). Free street parking is easy to find but might require a little bit of walking (but not much!).   While the main dining area can get quite loud, the outside patio out back is like a little oasis -- charming, relaxing, and a great place to enjoy dinner. Try the Choo Chee Tofu. If I could eat it all of the time, I would probably get sick of it. But since I can't, I wish I could because it is amazing. Thai basil AND kaffir lime leaves? Sign me up! It's probably worth noting that the portions are pretty big -- too big, really, but worth taking home.   The waitstaff varies pretty dramatically night to night, and sometimes they can get a bit spotty (and occasionally there's a bit of a language barrier, but nothing that can't be very easily overcome with a little patience). I've never had a really bad experience at this restaurant, though, and I go regularly since it's in my neighborhood.  Special note #1: if you go in to get take-out and have to wait, they go out of their way to give you a glass of water or tea, which I've always found charming and have been very appreciative of.   Special note #2: the bathroom is kind of amazing.   Special note #3: yum.",

I had 3 different waiters.  I told one of them I didn't like it and he had a manager (I assume) and I told him that I did not like it.  I didn't want to eat it, honestly.  He said he would take it back and fix it. (I was wondering how they were going to fix it.)  He said their recipe is sweeter than most to balance out the heat.  Weird.  Pad Thai isn't super sweet.  He took my plate back and they added tons of fish sauce to it.  So, you can imagine how it smelled and tasted.  The manager told me had tasted it and it was very sweet.  It was just a bad experience and they still made me pay for the gross food.  Needless to say, I didn't eat it.  I was supposed to get free soup or salad with my meal also and never got my salad.  I won't be back.  I think it was overpriced and just gross.",

I believe the last time I was here I sorta wanted to be impressed more. This time, I was!  I went all in and swayed from my usual Pad Thai and get crazy with another menu choice. Okay, I admit it wasn't super crazy. It was still a noodle dish, but hey, you gotta start somewhere, right? I ordered the Phad See Eaw, which is rice noodles with stir fried broccoli and sweet soy sauce. I 'm always into the shrimp, so I had to add some into the dish.   And you know what? It was awesome! Maybe better than the Pad Thai. Wait, it was better than the Pad Thai! Huge portion, enough to enjoy the next day. Now I'm excited to go back and try other dishes. Since there's a new location downtown it will give me that much more of an excuse to head down there to \"try\" the new joint out.   Hot Tip: BYOB and they do take reservations.

Mom ordered the vegetable pad thai and she really liked that too. Every entree comes with a house soup or a house salad but by the time we came the house soup were out so we settled for the salad. Which is fine too bc the dressing was very good.   Definitely will come back soon bc we loved the food and the service was very friendly.

Even though I am not vegetarian I sure do eat that way most times..   The service is always friendly and fast also. You can BYOB but I do believe there is a cork fee. But hey why not we brought a liter of wine with us last time haha!",

Neither of us have ever had anything other than top notch, and I try something new every time. Seating is tight, but I see that more just as the way it is as the food makes the squeeze well worth it. Dining on the back patio is very pleasant when the weather cooperates. The only thing I wish is that they would open another location in the South Hills somewhere. We have three Thai places within 10 minutes, but 5/6 times make fight the traffic into the North Side because it's just worth it.",

    "text": "I have resisted writing a review of Nicky's for a long time since I've tended to view this place as my own for the last 5-6 years. I've only ever recommended it to my closest friends in an attempt to keep the crowds down and to preserve this as a special, hidden gem for only MY use. I've taken friends there to introduce them to the pleasures of a truly great dining experience and EVERY ONE of them has been blown away. Alas, when the Pittsburgh Magazine list of top 25 restaurants included Nicky's, I knew it was over. Now I have to share this place with the great unwashed who haven't grown up with it like I have over the last several years. It pains me. Simply stated, this is WAY better than top 25. It might be top 2 or 3 in Pittsburgh. It's THAT good. But you won't like it so don't bother to go. (Will that keep you away and restore my own private relationship with Nicky's to what it used to be???)  First off, the appearance from Western avenue is not very inviting. You walk into a somewhat decrepit looking building down a hallway to the hostess station. You can see into the kitchen and all the activity and smells that emanate from there are assurance that you've come to the right place and that this is gonna be GOOD! You don't know the half of it. Seating options are inside or out. Outside is a magical garden filled with plants I didn't know could exist on the Northside. How they keep the appearance of an urban jungle is beyond me - but the atmosphere is instantly relaxing and soothing. A host of Thai-related accents, umbrellas over the tables, brick walls - all take you so far away from the Northside you can't even imagine you aren't in Southeast Asia. With a no corkage fee (except on weekends) policy it's one of the best places for BYOB in the city. So bring some wine or champagne and feast your eyes on the menu. Oh my. If you can read through that without needing to wipe the drool from your mouth you need to have somebody check your pulse I've eaten here probably 35 times or more and have sampled so many things - not one of which I didn't rave about or wouldn't order again. The flavors are unlike anything you'll see anywhere else. Thai food is one of my all time favorite cuisines and Nicky's tops the list! And don't associate Thai food with HOT - it isn't unless you want it to be. I always do - on a scale of 1-10 I always order \"Thai Hot\" which is above 10. But the flavors? The curries, noodles, spring rolls, pork/chicken/fish dishes, the soft-shell crabs - all filled with amazing sauces and flavors that you want to savor every bite. My mouth is watering even now as I think about it. Amazing. Plus, if you're a vegetarian, you have a huge selection of entrees that will knock your socks off.  Service is always excellent and attentive. Specials are so tempting and the price is right. I couldn't recommend it more highly. I could eat there several times a week. Wonder if they have a meal plan????",

Maybe it was what I ordered (pad see ew with chicken) because I ended up comparing it to another place I go to, which is a bit cheaper and delicious. The portion was a good size and the waiter was wonderful despite it being somewhat busy. I ended up having leftovers for the next day...bonus! I disliked how small the inside was, which is where two of us sat in a corner. Walking in is crowded right off the bat with us standing by the doorway waiting to be seated while other people try to escape through the narrow hallway. We didn't make reservations at all and it worked out for us somehow. I would give this place another chance and pick something different off the menu because I love Thai food.",

So you've heard how the rice can make or break sushi, well with Pad Thai that's the noodles.  They have to be dry, but not undercooked, and moist, but not wet.  Nicky's has that perfect balance.  I wish I lived closer so I could take out on a weekly basis.  Also that Thai Iced Tea, every day if I could.  Eating at the restaurant is also a great option, they have that covered garden in the back of the restaurant that makes it a perfect place to grab food and BYOB.  I love this place and highly recommend, but I'd feel guilty if I didn't mention one instance of contention.    My fiancee ordered the Massaman curry, which came with potatoes and there was clearly a rotten potato in the batch.  It had black going through the inside.  The kitchen came back and said it was because the potato had oxidized, but I cook often and know that oxidized potatoes don't go black through the inside!  Also keep your potatoes in cold water so they don't oxidize!  We didn't push the issue, but were miffed about the bold face lie.  I have always had quality every other time since I've been, but my fiancee still refuses to eat there.",

    "text": "Went To Nicky's Thai Kitchen in the North Side on a Thursday night, made 6:15 reservations for 2.  Was greeted and seated promptly.  The good:  We got chicken satay as an appetizer and both enjoyed it.  As his main entree he got pad thai with chicken at a \"spicy level\" of 4 and I got chicken noodle soup-- it was a cold night, so that sounded really good to me.  We both enjoyed our food, but neither one of us was particularly impressed.     Our server was attentive and prompt, our water glasses stayed filled, dirty dishes were cleared quickly.   I think the space is interesting--it's obvious it used to be a home-- but I have to admit, it wasn't very comfortable.  Seating was cramped and the room got very noisy, so it was difficult to have a conversation.  There is only one bathroom (which needed some cleaning attention) and I was only in there briefly before someone was knocking on the door to get in.  For me, that's a problem.  I like to take my time in the restroom, possibly fix makeup/hair, check teeth, that sort of thing, and being rushed to get out by the next person really chars my cupcakes.  It's BYOB and they charged a $5.00 corkage fee.  I've been to other BYOB places in the Pittsburgh area and this is the first place I've been to that charges a fee higher than $3.00.  I know it's only $2.00 more than other places I'm used to, but I brought Casillero del Diablo Pinot Grigio which has a screw top, so paying $5 for a corkage fee really seemed unreasonable to me.  Maybe I'm just being picky.  We had tickets to see a performance of A Streetcar Named Desire at the New Hazlett Theater nearby, so I chose this place because it was convenient and other Yelpers seemed to have good things to say about it.  My assessment:  I will probably never go here again, if there's another event I wish to attend at the New Hazlett anytime soon I'll try to find some other place.  I like to be able to talk to whomever I'm with and I need a restaurant to offer me something exceptional for me to return.  There was nothing exceptional about Nicky's.    My advice to you:  If you're looking for a dining experience that's just \"meh,\" go ahead.",

Oh and they are also byob, which is great. Although it is winter time and the outdoor patio is not open, I absolutely cannot wait until that warm spring day when they do open the patio again.

Also, the price was right (around thirty dollars for an appetizer and an entree, the latter of which yielded leftovers). My husband got the tiger cry beef salad, which despite its name does not involve any tears. This came with sticky rice and a Thai vinegrette and was enough to fill him up. Minus one star for my 1/5 spicy green vegetable curry being almost too hot to eat. I just finished the leftovers, and they were really rather uncomfortable for such a low spice level. Many people we know say Nicky's has the best Thai food in town, but I will only go back if I can find something on the menu I like that leaves my taste buds intact.",

That being said, it can be rather loud - during our last visit there was a bachelorette party and a rather loud family sandwiched on both sides of us.

One thing, though, the north side location has an interesting smell (that doesn't smell like food) when you walk in. Has anyone else noticed that? Or maybe it's just me, heh. North side, however, has outdoor seating that is quite nice in the warmer months.   The food has always been great here, whether it's take out or dine in. I've never had anything I hated. The service is also always great; your water is refilled after every single sip you take. My complaint with Nicky's Thai Kitchen is its selection of noodles; I wish it had more options that you usually find at other Thai restaurants.   My favorite dish to order at Nicky's Thai is their pineapple curry, but I haven't had this anywhere else so I don't have anything to compare it to.

I highly recommend it and ask to sit on the patio weather permitting.   When we got there the place had an old home feel to it. The staircase and thick wood rail were very unique. After we got waited on we were sent back to the patio. This patio was amazing it felt like you were whisked away to another world. Even though right through the dense is the road like a little slice of paradise. Place filled with fixtures and statues. The fountains and waterfalls give it a nice touch.   We were seated we were quickly given water and explored the menus. So to start we got the chef special spicy  mussels. They were delicious but bordering on my tolerance for spice level. For my main course I got the mix seafood grill pad Tai since I was familiar with it. It was AMAZING! It had a nice flavor with right amount of spice for me ( I got level 3 ). The seafood was not scarce either. It had mussels, squid, shrimp, crab, and scallops. There was not a bite that didn't have seafood in it.  My date got the SeaBass which he absolutely adored. I had a bite of it and the kefir lime gave the dish a lovely citrus taste.  I found everything about this place intriguing and can't wait to try it out again. The dishes I saw come out of the kitchen all looked so yummy!",

I always go for the Pad See Ew with vegetables, but the last time I had Nicky's the food really had zero flavor. I don't see consistency with their cooking. I ordered a spice level 9/10 last time and it had zero spice; the workers warn you anything above 5 is extremely spicy. Also in recent times my noodles have not been fresh, tasting hard and stale. And the flavor was basically all oil and zero spice/flavor. Sad to review this because the staff is truly wonderful, as is the outside garden for dining. If you do go definitely go in the warmer months to take advantage of the beautiful ambience of the back yard.",

And the server didn't even apologize but gave another bowl of soup saying that this is clear without any fly in it. Then after having couple of spoons I again noticed a fly sticked to coriander in the soup. This time he didn't apologize and asked for another one . I said and he just went way in negligence. I don't know as we were hungry we had the food and left. They didn't even bothered that they had served that kind of food. Guys please check your food while eating. I know taste is good but make sure that you don't end eating flies. So observe while you eat .",

    "text": "Yeah, so it pains me to write a poor review about this place because the food is not bad (I still like Thai Cuisine, Bloomfield better) but here goes the sad, short story.  I take a client to Nicky's.  Arrive at 11:50, check.  Place order at 12:10, check. Receive salad at 12:15 (not enough dressing), check.  Then silence. Food going everywhere except our table.  12:40: We flag down the waitress.  Hey waitress, everyone is getting food except us. Could you check on our order? 12:45, waitress returns: yeah, sorry, big mistake.  They bagged all of your food for take-out and it's been sitting on the counter. 12:50: Fine, guess we're not eating lunch.  So shit happens, right?  Here's the kicker.  We go to get our food and after wasting an hour of  our time, leaving us famished, and turning warm green curry from a tummy pleaser into cold, congealed take-out, they ask us to pay full price for our meals!  Like, what part of keep the customer satisfied don't you get?  So we do, and there it sits on my desk for another two hours.   This is not rocket science.  You fail to serve a customer for an hour, you give them their food and maybe a discount coupon to get them to return.  Apparently not here.  I'll take my business to Thai Cuisine, Bloomfield.  Recommend you do as well.",

Most in our group went was thinking the same and got the chicken, shrimp and veggie with varying spice levels. My veggie was FULL of fresh veggies and the sauce was super light and refreshing. Others got the pumpkin curry, chicken teriyaki, wonton soup and all cleaned their plates. Next time I am eager to order other fresh spring rolls, fat noodles and a curry as they all looked so good coming out of the kitchen!  Drinks: BYOB which is always nice. $5 cork fee per wine bottle and 50 cents per beer bottle  Atmosphere: Outdoor patio is great! Covered top and lots of greenery around. Our party of 10 sat comfortably in the back.   Value: $13.75 is quite pricey for pad thai, however, the BYOB helped in keeping the whole cost of the bill down.",

I had the Pad See Eaw which I've had at many Thai restaurants and is my staple at Thai Taste in Charlotte. It was on par with Thai Taste which is saying something. We also had the spring rolls which were okay in flavor, but a bit dry. I give them a pass on this as I honestly feel like they maybe weren't prepared fresh as the rice paper seemed a bit dehydrated. This could be because we were in not too long before close.   Overall, great service and a great experience. We will be back next time we are in Pittsburgh.",

While a roof does cover the space, you still feel like you are dining outdoors in a lush Thai garden complete with a water feature.   The food was really good. It's the most authentic Thai food I have tasted in the nicest of spaces. Normally the best food comes out of a hole in the wall dive, but the latter doesn't come anywhere close to describing this place.   For appetizers I tried the crab rangoon. These slightly crispy wontons were stuffed with crab and cream cheese, the latter being the overwhelming flavor. They were served with what the menu called a pineapple sauce; while I found the sauce a great accompaniment, I didn't sense an overwhelming amount of pineapple.   I also tried the Thai Toasts appetizer which was my favorite of the two. The presentation of this dish was really creative - they really were made to look like little mini finger sandwich triangles.  These contained pork and a wonderful selection of spices. They were also a little crispy on the outside as they were fried in egg. They were served with a really light sauce (cucumber according to the menu).   I ordered the pepper steak for my main (dine-in only). The meat was cooked to a medium well temperature I would say. It was thinly sliced and atop of pile of fresh veg. A large side of white rice completed the dish.   I can't wait to come back and try something else from the rather extensive menu.",

The guy in charge of water refills was totally on his game, however, and though we were hungry, thirst was not a problem.  The food here is really good.  The menu offers a decent and well-rounded selection of the standards (curries, rice noodles, soups) plus some more interesting house specialties which add the restaurant's own flare on top of traditional choices.  They also provide some welcome rarities, like the Wild Curry (a curry dish with no coconut milk for those who want a change of pace or something less sweet) and some dessert options (like pumpkin custard).  Recommendations: -If you live nearby, make this a take-out place.  Call in the order and avoid the rush. -If you don't live nearby but are in the area, stop in if and only if you have a lot of time and are craving Thai (there are plenty of other good nearby options as well, like Carmi Family Restaurant practically across the street). -If you aren't in the area and want Thai food, there are lots of other good options in Pittsburgh, so you might consider passing this one up.",

    "text": "In sum, lovely and cozy place tucked back into the North side. If it is nice outside you MUST sit at the outside patio. The food has been inconsistent between the two visits I had here. Sadly, that is not very encouraging. They do offer affordable lunch specials and I believe the scenery alone is worth a trip.  I work in the South Side, driving over to Nicky's on my lunch break is easy peasy. What I really come here for is the unique outside seating. Sitting in an office all day long with very dirty windows makes one long for the sun and wind. I love all the pretty greenery on the patio at Nicky's, the large umbrellas to block the fierce afternoon sun, and enjoying the mini vacation while sipping on the most excellent iced Thai green tea.  The service here is S-L-O-W. I am salary, I can bite this bullet from time to time. Yet, I wanted to put it out there if you are pressed for time, one might consider stopping elsewhere. In their defense, we always bring at least a party of 5. Perhaps, the slowness is due to the party size?  The iced Thai green tea, if you are not familiar, if quite delicious. It is a yummy concoction of brewed green tea, spices, and milk. If I had to venture my best educated guess I would say I could taste a bit of star anise. Maybe ever-so-slightly a bit too much of it? Methinks the aftertaste is quite unmistakable. The milk is a nice touch, I think it might be condensed milk as the sweetness of the tea is something a little more than mere sugar alone could bring about. I typically do not take milk in my tea, but this drink has me reconsidering. Quite a refreshing beverage to drink on a hot, sunny summer day as it was today.  I *technically* kept my word. I promised when I wrote my last Thai review, for The Smiling Banana Leaf, that I would something other than Shrimp Pad Thai- my go-to entree at any given Thai restaurant. Well, I did not order it, but I did order two appetizers I have already had before! Come on, it was lunch I did not want to overeat and go back to the office =)  I choose the crab rangoon. Rumor has it, this is an island dish. Naw, I am not buying it. This totally sounds like a made in the U.S.A type of dish. Do not get me wrong I am a complete sucker for it and will order it when I see it on a menu. This rangoon was a bit disappointing. The filling was perfect, sweet cream cheese, scallions, and crab. But the wrapper needed another moment or two in the fryer. It was only partially crispy. I was bummed.  For my other appetizer I ordered the soup. Another go-to Thai soup I love is Tom Kha soup. Now here is where it get very depressing. I never considered that one could scold coconut broth. However, after eating this soup today I am convinced this phenomena can happen. The shrimp was presence lacked in my opinion (two of them). The plus side, they were large shrimp. The fresh spices were sparse, for a medium heat level this was not medium.   A lack of spicing took me back. I have ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai at a medium level before and I felt like a horse diving my head into a water trough the way I was throwing down glasses of water. I either caught this place on a bad lunch- else their standards have slipped since I came here last summer. The jury is out on this one...",

I order everything from there \"Thai\" hot and it is usually just the right heat for my palate.  I also like the crab fried rice,  Phad See Eaw, and the Sriracha Seafood Noodle Soup.

    "text": "They should add a tagline to Nicky's Thai Kitchen as Thai food heaven. If you are from out of town (like me), don't be fooled by the entrance of this restaurant. Once you go it, just ask for a table outside and you would be surprised to see the decor and the Thai cultural design of their outdoor seating.   My wife and I visited the National Aviary which is less than a mile from this restaurant. We spent almost 5 hours at the aviary and wanted to eat lunch at around 3PM. So, I looked up nearby Thai restaurants on Yelp and Nicky's shows up first on the list. Quick look at the reviews and menu on my phone and we were on our way to check this place out for ourselves. Luckily found metered parking right in front of the restaurant. We entered not being very sure how much longer the restaurant will be open for lunch. There were hardly any people dining inside the restaurant. My wife asked to be seated outside even though it was around 90+ degrees heat. When we walked out through the wooden structures and plants and golden buddha statues and entered the outdoor seating area, it was 75% occupied and the Sun didn't even seem to bother any of us.   The menu is extensive with all the traditional Thai dishes. We ordered a veg fried rice and a eggplant stir fry with tofu. Both the dishes came with a choice of soup or salad. Everything tasted real good and the staff service was very nice. We clicked a ton of pictures of the place as it was very beautifully done with waterfalls and statues and wooden wheels etc. When the bill finally arrived it was less than $20  for a heavy meal with excellent service and ambience.",

    "text": "Nicky's Thai Kitchen was truly a great experience. I was really surprised with everything here, and did not expect such an experience.   I had heard about this place once or twice and was all about going. I ventured over with two friends (one who has been there before) It was a stormy summer Pittsburgh night, but he insisted that we sit outside, which was fine with me!  We got there around 5:45 on a Monday evening so it wasn't busy at all. We walked out through a small dim lighted dining room then out to the patio, which was beautiful little oasis. Filled with plants and Buddhas. It was actually the perfect environment to sit outside during a storm. There were about 20 different colored/patterned umbrellas covering the patio, which made it all the more charming.  The service was good, and the waitress was patient with us while we decided what we wanted. She also carried food outside while it was raining (the patio was completely covered by umbrellas so she didn't get wet at all!) But nonetheless we tipped her well!   My friend & I ordered the Grilled mint Beef Salad & Pumpkin Curry with pork to split. I could not pass up either of these entrees! The waitress asked us how spicy we wanted it, and we said very spicy.   The Beef salad was first, and might I add it came out rather quickly. It was a refreshing combination of tender beef, lettuce, red onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, cilantro, mint, and a spicy Thai chili sauce. It was an excellent array of flavors in my opinion. Although, I can't say I've ever had a similar dish, so it was easy to impress me.  Next was the Pumpkin Curry. I've had pumpkin curry one other time and it was good, but this blew me away. Soft nibblets of Asian pumpkin, basil, coconut milk, and a spicy red curry. It was a good level of spice for me, but I'm assuming they brought us the spiciest level, I would expect a little more for 'the spiciest level' though.  I also ordered a Thai iced tea, sweet & refreshing. It is BYOB, which we didn't know. Next time we will bring our own bottle of wine for sure!  I gave this place 5 stars ( I am easily impress though) The food was excellent, I left there completely satisfied, Service was friendly & quick, the outdoor seat was perfect! If you go there definitely request a table outside, even if it's raining. Honestly the stormy atmosphere made it more enjoyable, for me at least! And all for just under $25, you can't go wrong. All the curries were $12.50, usually good curry is around $14 so I was super impressed by this.",

I ordered the green curry with tofu, spice level 3. Yeah, I was being wimpy as I wasn't sure of how they handled their spices. It just tasted so very bland. I was a little disappointed as I had heard so many people call them the best thai in town.  Round 2: since I work in north side three days a week my immediate options are rather limited. Fast food or a handful of other places, most of which I do not want to visit. I decided Nicky's deserves another try. I ordered the same lunch entree, but this time spice level 6. Whenever I'm giving a restaurant another try I also reorder the same thing (unless I found it to be really disgusting) to see if maybe they were just having an off day or I really don't like it. This time it tasted absolutely phenomenal! I still should kick the spice level up to a 7 or 8, but I was pretty happy with what they did.  I've only ever done take-out so I can't speak to the waiters/waitresses, but the front of house people have been fantastic both times. Very nice and welcoming. Sitting and waiting for my food, I've noticed that they treat each person who walks in very well. Gotta love service with a smile. :D",

What I really noticed was a unique Thai restaurant in a converted Pittsburgh house that happens to have a very extensive menu which took me well over 10 minutes to analyze before making a selection.  That in itself was quite impressive.    The fun continued when the food came out: very hot, very spicy (as requested), and incredibly tasty.  There are so many options to appease even the pickiest of Thai connoisseurs.  You will not be disappointed.  To be blunt, this is perhaps the best Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, or at least in the top 2.   It's really tough to say, I guess when you consider the awesomeness that is Smiling Banana Leaf.  You really should do yourself a favor and check this place out.",

Also, the price is amazing - $8.51 for a lunch portion and they give you a decent amount of food. I definitely had leftovers.  If you don't like loud noises, I suggest you sit outside. You're jammed into a small room with a tall ceiling so the noise carries to the point where you don't know if you're even talking anymore. Other than that, I give Nicky's a thumbs up!",

    "text": "I must preface this review by saying that this is the only time I visited Nicky's Thai Kitchen (or Pittsburgh for that matter), so it could just be a fluke - maybe the chef had a bad day - but this is the second worst Thai food I've had anywhere in the world...  The worst was in Aruba.   I'm a fan of Thai food as you can tell - craving it even when on vacation in Aruba - so I have a certain expectation when I saw the 4-star ratings for this restaurant.  But wasn't I disappointed!  We ordered Drunken Noodles and Panang Curry, both with beef, and spicy.  Typical Thai dish right? Wrong.  What we got are two tasteless dishes.  The Drunken Noodles dish is not just bland and way too mild, but both the veggie and meat tasted stale.  The Panang Curry was equally unimpressive. The color of the broth may be right, but there is only a hint of curry taste in it.  The meat was chewy to the point that I gave up on most of it.  As hungry as we were after a long day of driving, you would think that we would find anything tasty.  But unfortunately for us, we threw away at least half of it and had to look for a second dinner.  I don't know, maybe the chef just isn't very good at the common dishes.  Not sure if I'll have a chance to give it another try, though.",

We were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation time, but that wasn't a big deal.  The food was quite good and reasonably priced.  We have a sampler appetizer platter, and everyone had different curries for dinner.  I had the Massaman curry (red curry with potatoes), which was good, but could have used a bit more variety of ingredients.  It was basically just the curry, chicken and potatoes.  My friend had the panang curry, which gave me a bit of food envy.  I think I'll order that the next time I go to Nicky's.  The spice level requests are a bit of novelty too.  We had different curries ranging from a 5-8.  There was a noticeable difference in the spice levels, but even an 8 wasn't spicy to the point where you couldn't taste the other flavors in the curry.  I might go for a 6 or 7 next time.  It's BYOB - I'm a huge fan.  We knocked down a couple bottles of wine and some beer during dinner.  The only real negative of the evening was that they asked us to give up our table for a large group coming in who had a reservation before we were done drinking... I suppose I can forgive them for that.",

    "text": "What a fantastic time I had at Nicky's Thai Kitchen during my first experience with Thai food! Now, going into this I was pretty excited yet nervous to try Thai food. I had heard nothing but great things about it, but what makes me so nervous was the heat factor. Anyone who knows me, will tell you I'm a huge baby when it comes to spicy and hot foods. On the other hand, my girlfriend enjoys eating spicy foods. Leave it up to her to sike me out about how hot the food might be.  Upon arrival, we walked in and headed up the stairs to a somewhat dim dining room. Did not bother me much at all because we had just come from Lefty's (local bar nearby) where we had 2 very Strong Islands! So needless to say, nothing bothered me about the lighting, but for some maybe too dark. We were then meet by our kind server, who was nice.   My first time being at a Thai food spot, I wasn't sure what I would like and maybe wouldn't like. I was actually able to come to a pretty quick decision when I saw the Pumpkin Curry Chicken! I'll be damned, how good that turned out to be! Now I was a bit nervous because I was preparing myself to tell the waiter how not hot I wanted my food haha. It was painless, my GF got a 3, and I ended up getting a 1. I just thought folks would maybe judge me because I was getting a 1, I know right, how silly of me to think that.   All was well when the food hit the table. The pumpkin curry came with 3 chicken thighs, the curry and white rice. Also had some peanuts tossed on top for texture. Unreal good! I am also very happy with my visit because other than my girlfriends curry, this has to be the best curry I've had! The chicken was cooked wonderfully, and the flavor of the pumpkin curry was unlike anything I've had. A tasty dish indeed! I would recommend Nicky's Thai Kitchen! Even if you are like me and not too big on spicy food, you can still come here and enjoy your Thai food. No worries about how spicy things can get, if I can take a 1, anyone can handle it. Great place to come get stellar food!",

Having been to the downtown location as well, North Side definitely has more space and wasn't too crowded! The outside area is probably one of my favorite outside restaurant venues, similar to Pusadee's Garden in Lawrenceville. They preserve a lot of traditional Thai pieces outside amongst the greenery and fountain decoration!   In terms of food, I had pad see yew with chicken and was pleasantly surprised that the chicken wasn't as dry as other places I've had this dish. Since we came for lunch, all orders came with soup or salad as well! A lot of my friends enjoyed their curries here, although they serve in more elaborate dishes at the downtown location during dinner. And their Thai Tea is quite good, although I prefer thicker and creamier than their recipe. They serve Green Thai Tea which is special though!   Service was so kind, I accidentally knocked over my water, and they helped me clean up and brought a new one out immediately. Most of all, we were able to split the check with 7 people (THANK YOU) and overall loved the space and food!",

Literally, if I was going to die and had to choose a final meal, I would choose it. It's incredible. I order take out from here incredibly often, but had the wonderful opportunity to come here for a friend's birthday last week. It's so beautiful inside- the indoor area is quite small and cozy and the outdoor area is an incredibly beautiful oasis. We tried their massive appetizer sampler, which was great. Everything was so tasty! I love their crab rangoons, and I found the shrimp cakes to be really tasty as well. I also ordered a small garden salad- theirs comes with mango, pineapple, peanuts, cucumber, tomato, etc. and a delicious pineapple dressing. It was so tasty. Of course, I had the masaman curry with chicken (spicy level at a 3- there's only goes up to 5, so keep that in mind). Incredibly amazing. I tried the coconut sticky rice for desert, it was SO good. Not too sweet, but really satisfying. You cannot go wrong with Nicky's.  Word to the wise: if you want to order extra rice to go, just ask for extra rice to go. Not extra \"sticky rice\" to go, like I did. I came home and was a little surprised to find coconut sticky rice in my bag. It surprisingly wasn't bad with the leftover curry, but still.. something to keep in mind :)",

    "text": "I was recommended this place by a Yinzer I used to work with.  He is a foodie and beer connoisseur.  Since I'm not from the Burgh it has taken me a long time to get out there.  So I finally was able to take another Yinzer friend of mine for his birthday when I made an impromptu surprise visit.  I am so glad that we went.  It was raining and dismal.  We walked in and they asked if we would like to be inside or outside.  Anyone who knows me knows that I will choose outside 100% of the time when it is gorgeous outside.  I look at her and say it's raining.  Is it covered?  She said it was covered.  Sold!!  That choice was simple.  What a beautiful patio.  Serene is the best way to explain it.  You could hear the rain drops on the roof.  So nice.  Calming.  There was a fountain in the middle of the room and plants and statues everywhere.    Onto Service.  Our server was V.  I say like Vee and she said nope just V like as in victory or vendetta...hmmm this is going to be an interesting meal.  I am a server and I can appreciate her wittiness.  She comes across dead pan serious when she is talking to you but with the things she is saying you can understand that she is intelligent and knowledgeable.  What is not to love!!  We find out that she is studying for some god awful intelligent subject.  She is destined to make some difference in the world.  She did a fabulous job and I hope that she will be there when I visit the next time.  So we look at the menu and it is vast...all the options are represented.  My buddy is a Pescatarian.  So his options are limited.  I am thankful that my options are limitless.  However, I do have to concede on a few things if we are to share an appetizer.  Oh well...I'll make due.  We choose a dish I believe is called Veg for You or something like that.  It is like a sampler of sorts.  It had the Fresh Spring Rolls, Somosa, and another item I just can't place right now.  But everything was delish.  I would easily get that again.  I also order the Shrimp Cakes.  After all it is his birthday so let's Fish it up.  Onto the main course.  A dish catches my eye not for me but in general because of the name and the location on the menu.  I know that my buddy would probably enjoy this dish if it fits his dietary requirements.  So when V comes back we ask what exactly is the Vegan Duck Curry.  Completely serious she says that they feed the duck only vegetables for 12 months and then waits for the response.  Wow...funny!  She says she is kidding and explains that it is a vegetarian protein...yada yada yada.  So he chooses that and because I want to try something new I ask for suggestions.  She gave me three and I settle with the Garprow Lad Kao (I just called them to find out the name since it is not on the online menu).  Say that 3 times fast.  It had two cooked over easy eggs on top.  She asks both of us the level of heat we would like to have 1-5.  5 would be the typical Thai Hot that I am used to.  I usually get that and then ask for more powder to up the level of heat.  V then says Thai Hot?  No refunds?  Now that gives me Pause to think.  I have been to several places and gotten Thai Hot.  I have always added more heat at the end...Can this place be so hot that they are like No refunds?  What do I do?  I say what the heck!  If it is too hot then I deserve that.  I order Thai Hot and she also gets us the Sauce tray.  Why not right?  Everything was so good.  The sauce tray was a nice added touch and I did still add some more heat.  I found out that she could have done a 6 Level of Heat!  Maybe on my next trip.    Now it is time to find out if I can surprise my bestie with a Birthday embarrassment.  It would only be the second time this weekend.  V is more then happy to oblige.  She comes out with a nice Pumpkin Curd and a candle and of course we sing and embarrass him.  The curd was also amazing like the rest of the experience.  Thank you V for helping me make this time special.  Thank you Nikki's Thai Kitchen for just having the right atmosphere and food to match.  Anyone who is planning a trip to the Burgh make sure you add this to your visit itinerary...ask for V she is delightful.",

    "text": "This is a review on take out only since, unfortunately, we were not able to dine in this past Friday night. In an old Victorian house, this is such a cute building with a gorgeous outdoor patio, tucked away in such a revitalized area of the city. I called to place a take out order at about 8 pm this past Friday. My call was answered quickly and I was advised it'd be ready in 25 minutes. We ordered a basil chicken entree at a 6 and a pad Thai chicken, also at a 6 spice level. Both portions were absolutely ginormous ! The basil chicken was plentifully packed with green beans, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and eggplant. The meal was flavorful and not overly spicy at all. The pad Thai chicken was also flavorful but not spicy.  I tasted a small bite of it and it was the best pad Thai I've had in quite some time! The food was ready when I arrived after 25 minutes so it was great I didn't have to wait. Parking was very easy too although it is street only. I'd love to go back in the future and up my review to five stars once I get a taste of the in house service!",

The tables are adorned with fresh flowers from the nearby flower shop. In the warmer months the outdoor seating is the best way to eat a Nicky's. As far as their scale of spice, an essential element of anyone who likes to indulge in the more sadistic culinary elements, Nicky's does stick to a 1-10 scale. However, ask your server for \"Thai spicy\" and the scale gets delightfully more brutal to the palate.    My only gripe about Nicky's would e the pad Thai. I'm a fan of soft cooked veggies when they're steeped in a curry. However, when I see a pad Thai that looks like a wet noodle bowl I am instantly turned off. With ingredients as fresh as they pull out for garnishes, I would have expected something crisp or even raw in the pad thai.",

I had the Grilled Duck Curry which came in a brass looking bowl with candle underneath to keep everything warm and a bed of rice to accompany it.   We also had some sweet potato samosa and some crab rangoon both were delicious.   Nicky's has great food and when it's not freezing outside you can sit on the back patio which is hear is pretty nice.

They were both well done items. The thai iced tea was also a hit.  I got the Thai Style Fried Rice for me meal and thought it was kind of bland, but maybe that was my fault for picking a fried rice.

The pork larb was new for me and quite tasty. The Phad Thai was flavorful, but too juicy. The crab fried rice was bland but plentiful. One of the people at our table ordered a red snapper dish that was quite spicy but pretty good. The fish was crispy on the outside, yet tender inside.  The dining room is small and very loud. My companions and I had to raise our voices above normal talking level just to hear each other. And a $5 per bottle corkage fee for a restaurant of this nature is, in my opinion, ridiculous. We paid more to drink our three 12 oz. bottles of beer than we did to buy them.  Overall, it wasn't a bad experience and we'll likely go back to try other menu options. We'll just make it when we don't have much to say, and don't want a beer with dinner.",

I was not happy about leaving this amazing city and flying home to a city I've grown to loathe, and our attempts to eat in the Strip District had been thwarted by crowds, traffic and a restaurant who refused to serve us. We walked into Nicky's and it was warm, it smelled great and the staff actually smiled at us.   Honestly, they could have served us dog food at that point and I would have been satisfied. The fact that they actually served good food was a bonus. The lunch special, somewhere in the vicinity of $6.99, was a bowl of chicken and rice soup and an entree. I got Chicken Pad Thai, and it was delightful. It's not the best Pad Thai I've ever had, but it wasn't too sweet and it filled me up. With drinks, the two of us got out for less than $20.  Nicky's was the last meal I'd have in Pittsburgh, and after loads of sandwiches stacked with french fries, possibly the best. It'll always have a special place in that cold dark place that resides deep in my bosom.",

We had a few pregnant ladies in the group who brought sparkling juice and they charged $2 per bottle which I think was unnecessary. We started off with the spring rolls and samosas. All fresh and tasty with a good size portion of each. I really recommend the samosas.  The menu has many options and you can pick your spice level.  For my entree I went the pineapple fried rice with veggies. Also have  your choice to add shrimp, pork, chicken or tofu. Not liking hot things I went with a zero spice level-yes go ahead and laugh but it was not too spicy at all. Great flavor combo of pineapple with nuts and raisins.  Others in my party ordered various types of curry dishes which are served in a really neat bowl. The service was excelled and we had a huge group.",

The food is quite good with many familiar dishes.  I'd give this place a slight edge over the location on Penn avenue which is more crowded.",

With reservations, the hostess said we have someone coming in in 2 hours so we need you to be done with your meal. That is OK with us as long as the kitchen doesn't take to long, we reply.   BYOB.  Maybe it was because we had a few bottles of wine, they thought we might linger. We were eager to order...love Thai food.  We were not disappointed. The veggie dumping was delicious.  Soft with some nice spiciness, yet mild. I order the Gaprow Lad Kao with pork.  Stir fried with bell pepper, garlic, basil leaves, spicy brown sauce, topped with fried egg, served over rice. Nice and spicy, but not to much, some sweetness too.  Well we finished with no room for desert and easily made or deadline!",

I've both dined in and gotten take out and haven't seen a difference in the plates I order. Recently I had dinner outside on their patio which was beautiful!! I definitely recommend checking their patio out. It elevates the entire Nicky's experience.   Sometimes Nicky's is a little rough around the edges in terms of staff friendliness when picking up to-go orders, but it doesn't effect the food so it doesn't bother me. One time, they accidentally gave my to go order to a GrubHub driver and I had to wait an extra 20 minutes for the GrubHub driver to bring it back. While I waited they offered me a free thai iced tea while I was waiting and one to go with my food, so I appreciated their kindness in that situation.   Overall, I highly recommend Nicky's for Thai food in Pittsburgh!",

Off Western avenue, Nicky's has ample street parking opportunities and is across from 412 Brewery and near War Streets brewery. What sets it apart from other Thai places is that it doesn't look cookie cutter. The fresh spring rolls were a delight, and the pad thai was delicious. Not greasy. I ordered a medium level of spiciness, which was adequate. Just remember, go low and get a spice tray on the side. What is done can't be undone. The service was quick, and the prices are very reasonable. Its summer patio is like a Thai oasis. You can't not take pictures of the place. I now live in Pittsburgh, so I look forward to eating more at Nicky's in the future. I encourage everyone to come just for the experience of sitting in the patio. You won't regret it.",

While the downtown restaurant is always busy and a bit crazy, this location is calm and has a fantastic back patio with fountains, statues, and plants. Our server was excellent too. She continuously filled up our water glasses and brought us everything we needed without us even asking; it's like she could read our minds. I ordered the Cashew Chicken entree and it was delicious. The dish is full of peppers, carrots, broccoli and onions, as well as chicken and topped with cashews. My spice level of 3 was just enough to give it a bit of heat but not too much to not enjoy the flavor. I would have liked the veggies to be cooked just a little bit longer to be less crunchy, but I still really enjoyed my meal. Portion sizes are quite large too, so you have leftovers.",

I really like the decor, it reminds me of home. The server was attentive and friendly, so that's always a plus.  I got the tofu appetizer, wish its dry and not soaked in oil, i like my fries soggy but not my tofu.  The first dish I got salmon green curry, I could taste the coconut milk and it's tasty and rich with flavor, they also put enough veggies(mangoes broccolies onions carrots)  The second dish I got thai style fried rice in Thai Hot, they cut up thai chili and it was spicy. The flavor was just okay to me. I cook all the time so in my head, I could make this fried rice at home lol.  I found that Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh area set their price pretty high compare to the other states. I could get the same fried rice veggie dish less than 15bucks. Overall, it was an okay experience. Will try more dish next time I'm in town.",

I'm obsessed with spring rolls so that was the first thing I ordered. Unlike other places, they cut up the rolls into pieces and I actually appreciated that. I would definitely order these again when I come back. I wanted to order noodles but I decided to get the basil tofu eggplant and I'm so glad I got it because it was so delicious. The tofu was firm enough to my liking and the sauce was so good. I couldn't stop raving about the sauce. I also love how they place a crab rangoon on top of the rice!   * Cost vs. Worth: We came around lunch time for their specials which was around $10. The entrees also came with a salad which I thought was a really good deal. I saw for dinner it's a little more than $14 for most of their dishes which I would honestly pay that amount as well!  Will I come here again? - Definitely.",

Either case, after stepping in, I felt like I was in Bangkok. There was a counter and kitchen. My food was ready so I was happy.  Chicken Pad Thai (spice level 4): 4.1/5 Just what I was looking for. By the look and taste, you can tell they know what they're doing. Subtle peanut undertones compliment the savory noodles wonderfully. This is what pad Thai is supposed to taste like. The chicken was under seasoned and over cooked, however. For a few bucks less and no chicken, this would have gotten a higher score.  Soup: 2.9/5 This came with the lunch special and I'm not sure what it really was. There was rice in some kind of ginger broth. if it was just powdered ginger in water, I wouldn't be surprised.   Crab Rangoon: 4.2/5 Light flaky outside; sweet, flavorful inside, exceeding in filling-to-shell ratio. The dipping sauce which I expected to be thicker was actually a delight. These didn't disappoint.   If I was in the area I would maybe come back, but would try a different protein with my pad Thai or a different dish altogether. Noodlehead in Shady Side still holds the title for best Pad Thai in Pittsburgh.",

There was already a line building up to get in here.  If you plan on coming here make sure to call ahead for reservations just to be safe.  Even though we were early they still sat us at our table right away.  It's a small dining room and it was packed.  So if you don't like eating in a small place maybe just order take out and go to a brewery.  Hey that's not bad idea!  Anyways we were seated and got comfy.   We have been eating a lot of Thai food lately and we both have been in a wide noodles type of mood so that's what we ordered.  First we started with Spring rolls with shrimp in them that were delicious.  We were hungry and ate every roll with no problem.  Like I said we have been eating a lot of Thai and this was up there as one of the best rolls.  Carrie asked for their hot spices to whip up here own spice which turned out pretty good.  I used some it too for my rolls.   It took about 15 to 20 minutes to get our main dish.  I ordered the Phad See Eaw and my wife ordered the Spicy Noodle.  Her dish was really good so check out her review on that.  My Phad See Eaw was good too.  I ate about half of it cause I wanted to leave some to take for home.  I'm glad that I did.  I thought my Phad See Eaw was a solid 4 at first.  I thought at another Thai restaurant my wide noodles were slightly better.  It wasn't until I got home and reheated my food the next day that I liked it even more.  I'm not sure why but sometimes reheated food does it for me and it sure did here.  It's a solid 5 just like a lot of our Yelp friends who love this place.   Overall we had a very nice dinner here and we are looking forward to coming back soon.  It is a little small in there but it's not too bad and it's a decent price for a lot of food.",

    "text": "Mmmmm. This place gets an extra star just because they were able to accommodate my extra cilantro request and actually delivered!   My friend and I went on NYE, thankfully we had made a reservation because I didn't know how tiny this place is!   We ordered & split: Vegetable 4 U app: Two fresh spring rolls, three crispy egg rolls and three samosas with dipping sauces. Spicy noodle: Wide rice noodles stir-fried egg with tofu and Napa cabbage in a spicy basil sauce Tofu tamarind: Deep fried tofu, over steam mix vegetable Topped with a sweet Tamarind sauce. Extra cilantro on both the entrees! Yaaaas. Spice level 1 which actually varied between the two dishes.   Our server was pleasant and helpful and overall the night was a success. I definitely can't wait to go back and try more of  the menu.",

    "text": "This place is cute but we had a few issues here. First, when I walked in the front door, I could smell a dog. I'm guessing the dog lives upstairs, but it was noticeable and bothered me. Second, the dining room is small and has quite an echo. There was a table with 2 ladies across the room talking very loudly and we couldn't hear ourselves think, much less hold a conversation. They had a patio that looked adorable, but I didn't have insect repellant, so we had to pass. Sadly, the door to the patio was repeatedly left open during our entire lunch, so bugs came inside anyway. The food was decent. The appetizer sampler was fun and we enjoyed it. The salad was simple and fresh. The curry I ate for lunch was okay, but both mine and my husband's food was over salted. I don't think we would go back to this place because of the issues.",

The one complaint was the bold birds. One flew so close to my girlfriend's head, it left her hair tousled. We understand there are some things out of the restaurants control, but just a friendly suggestion to seek ways to ward off these little creatures. The food was as expected with Thai, full of complex flavors of sweet, sour, and spicy. The salad portions were a bit small but could be a great appetizer. Overall, a positive experience and we will be coming back.",

It was a hot day but we could help but go out into their garden/outdoor eating area and check it out. So serene and beautifully decorated.   So about the food. We started with the Happy Hour special: Crab Rangoons. They were SOOO GOOD!   Next my husband and I each ordered the Chef's special: Phad Garprow Combo which was delicious!!! I ordered medium heat which was spicily perfect. It was stir fried ground chicken, bell peppers and basil in a sauce served on jasmine rice with 2 fried eggs on top. It also came with 2 egg rolls, 3 crab rangoons (which was awesome because I could have eaten just these by the platterful) and a bowl of Tom yum shrimp soup. Oh. My. Goodness! The food was divine.   Our grown daughter ordered another one of the chef's specials: Hung Ley Curry with Grilled Scallops. Another winner! Curry was complex and rich in flavor with lots of nicely sized scallops.   We couldn't stop saying, \"This is SO GOOD!\"",

    "text": "When I first moved to Pittsburgh three years ago I lived in Pleasant Hills, which is pretty deep into the South Hills. I found Sawasdee Thai and enjoyed everything I ate there, but every time I brought it up, a native friend would say, \"Oh, if you like Thai you really need to try Nicky's.\" I recently moved to the North Side and have been very much over-utilizing GrubHub and UberEats when I'm feeling too lazy to cook. Last night I got in at 8:30pm and was starving, so I opened up both apps to see what was open and delivering. Nicky's was the first thing to pop up, so I figured it was time to give it a try.  I ordered the cashew dinner with chicken, and a Thai iced tea. Delivery took about 45 minutes and they forgot my tea, not sure if that were the fault of the deliverer or the restaurant. The food, however, was VERY good. Garlicky and just spicy enough for my taste, and the portion was big enough for me to get 3 meals out of it. Definitely bookmarked for future Thai cravings!",

The panung curry with shrimp had great presentation but there was just something missing plus the Thai basil had stuck to the roof of my mouth.  I had to pick it out as they were like twigs. Shrimp was so rubbery. Just not worth an $80 meal. Plus the girl had an attitude when we told her she brought the wrong appetizer.  Mango tilapia was good. Crab rangoons good but they're near impossible to mess up.  Eggs rolls looked like the tiparella old time skinny cigar which probably would have tasted better.  I will go out of my way for Thai in Bloomfield... the best",

But the food just doesn't knock my socks off and the place is cramped and noisy.   This last time was my last straw. We had made reservations two weeks in advance for 8 o'clock. When we got there we found that we weren't the only ones with reservations that night and it seemed that most people weren't getting seated. We were told our table wasn't ready. After 15 minutes we pulled the 'we have a babysitter and she won't wait' line and got a table about 5 minutes later. I know that I wasn't the only one with reservations (people were being vocal about the situation) and others had probably been waiting longer, but it ticks me off that the whole point of having a reservation is so that you don't have to wait and then you end up waiting. And it isn't like they have a nice place for you to wait.   We ordered the Fried Tofu as a starter and I got the Tom Yum seafood soup. The soup was fantastic and I thought that would prove to restore my faith. But the fried tofu was not as stellar. I ordered the Shrimp Red Chili for the entree and it was not worth the $15 price tag. There were about five shrimps and two pounds of bell peppers. The sauce was also ho hum.  Sorry Nicky's. I will be exploring other Thai options in the future.",

    "text": "I went to Nicky's Thai Kitchen last night for the first time. My friend was in town visiting from Cleveland and we both wanted to try somewhere new.   Upon entering the restaurant, it was full of people in the hallway. Our reservations were at 8:00pm and we didn't get seated until 8:30pm. It seemed like a common problem on a busy night, but we weren't in a hurry and didn't mind waiting for our table.   We started with the fresh spring rolls which were all fresh vegetables wrapped in rice paper with a peanut soy dipping sauce. They were delicious. I felt like it took the place of a traditional salad before dinner. We also got the fried tofu which came with a sweet and sour sauce. That was also amazing. I would order either of these appetizers again when I go back.  For our main courses, I got the Pad Thai with shrimp (I figured I'd try their signature dish since it was my first time there) and my friend got the Yellow Chicken (Chicken curry) with potato dumplings. I did have a bite of that and it was a little too spicy for me, but other than that really good.   For dessert we got a black sticky rice with pumpkin (we had two bites and couldn't eat anymore of it - definitely not a favorite) and the fried banana dessert which was amazing.   Overall - I give it three stars. Thai isn't my favorite cuisine but this restaurant had great food. It's a very small room and you're sitting very close to the people next to you. I probably wouldn't recommend it for a first date situation because it is a little loud.   Being BYOB makes it nice - we brought a red wine (a $5 corkage fee) and Rumchata (a $10 corkage fee). We were confused about the difference in price and the only thing the waitress could tell us was \"$10 fee for liquids\". Eager to sip our Rumchata over ice after dinner, we just went with it, but not sure why the difference.",

I have tried numerous versions of green curries and Nicky's is one the top 2. Red curry all right. Pad Thai delivered a sweet taste not typically found but worked well. No grease in this pad Thai, a refreshing take. A delicate flavorful sauce with the Thai basil that made the whole dish.   Very affordable food and attentive service  Easily 5 stars. Drop by.",

They do their spicy food by numerical value. 1 the least spicy 10 the spiciest. I went with a 5 and was pleased with it but could have easily have gone hotter.  The best part besides the food is the reasonably priced food. My wife and I didn't pay over 20 dollars for our meal.",

I picked it up 15 minutes later, and brought it home. I pulled the lid off and prepared to crush some Thai. I got some peanuts, chicken, and peppers on my fork and hungrily plowed them into my face, at  a medium pace. It was delicious.  I was going for a second bite, and very suddenly my forehead was as wet as Lake Elizabeth.  My mouth was ablaze. I ran to the sink to get water to get a small measure of relief. When I bent my head down to put my lips to the spigot, blood poured out of face hole.  I spit 4 teeth out, my gums were melting!!!  I started stuffing wash rags in my mouth, I lit a sparkler and chewed on it to cauterize the flow, I then gargled bleach.  I burst a few blood vessels in my left eye, and suffered minor hearing loss after a 20 minute bout of vomiting.  I am now recovering, doing well, and am slowly coming to peace with what happened.  I will order out again from Nicky's.",

The vegan duck was superb!.veggie spring rolls perfect, fried rice very tasty. If I had to say anything negative I would  say a bit much oil was used in the fried rice.  We left very content. They accommodated us by putting 2 tables together for our comfort..",

It's getting to be a very popular place, and for good reason.  They serve excellent food at reasonable prices.  Also, I absolutely love the patio garden in the back.  The decor and plants are beautiful.  I asked the staff who waters the plants, and they said they do the work and that it takes an hour to water everything.  Regardless, I love the Spring Rolls, plus just about any dish on the menu is good.  I ordered a \"7\" on the 1 - 10 spice scale and my dish was definitely spicy enough.  The wait staff is attentive and helpful, and our food came quickly.  I had the Chile Mango Scallops, and they were delicious.  I highly recommend Nicky's.",

    "text": "I've only had Nicky's Thai Kitchen twice, but I will definitely be back.  The first time I ordered the garlic chicken lunch special and crab rangoons to go.  The garlic chicken I ordered was a spice level 6 which I found was a bit too spicy for me.  The portion size was fair for lunch and the chicken and vegetables were cooked very well.  They didn't separate the garlic chicken from the rice, which I didn't mind because I mix them together anyway.  The side salad that comes with the lunch special had expired lettuce in it, but the pineapple dressing was really fresh tasting.  The crab rangoons were a little bit soggy on the bottom, but they had a generous amount of filling and tasted delicious.  My second trip I went there to eat with a co-worker on a Thursday afternoon.  We got there just after they opened around 11:45 and sat on the back patio.  It was a really nice afternoon, about 75 and sunny.  The patio was decorated with flowers and other ornaments like Buddha's and dragon statutes which made it a really fun atmosphere.  It started getting more busy as time progressed and the temperature started getting a little uncomfortable, so if it's any higher than 75, I'd recommend eating inside.  I ordered the cashew chicken with a spice level 4 and it was a good spice level for me.  I might go up to a 5 next time just to see what that's like.  The salad this time was great, the lettuce was fresh and the dressing was sweet.  The chicken and vegetables were cooked perfectly and it even came with a crab rangoon which was again delicious.  The flavors were great, sweet and spicy just like I like.  My co-worker ordered the panang curry with vegetables and said it was good, but a little salty.  She said she prefers Thai Foon's panang to Nicky's.  Although I would still eat Thai Foon over Nicky's, I really enjoyed my lunch and thought it was a better value than Thai Foon and a better atmosphere.  If I had one gripe it would be that they didn't give us any type of knife and both the lettuce in the salad and the vegetables in both dishes were rather large and hard to eat without cutting.  I'm sure they would've given us a knife if asked.  I'll definitely be back for lunch again!",

The owner is Thai but worked in restaurants in L.A. and Las Vegas(I was told anyway)before settling here in PGH. to open the 2 locations.  I have been to both locations and even though the Verona building is not as elegantly designed and furnished, the food seemed better, somehow but at both places, you will find the BEST Thai grub in this god-forsaken city ... The crab rangoons are mind-blowing.  Pad Thai is perfect.  Other dishes on special are always good .  Hard to go wrong here.  Just wish they had more space. During warm months, try to get seated out in back in the very lush garden patio.  You'd think you were tele-ported to a jungle in South East Asia, somewhere and not the grubby crappy North side . Amongst Top-5 PGH. restaurants, imo . Gods help you if you walk in with a group and haven't made a reservation(especially at night ...) you'll be turned away or waiting forever .",

    "text": "I have been to many, many Thai restaurants from NYC to Philly, Allentown PA, Orlando, San Francisco, and even in the Midwest.  I was in town this past Friday (June 12th) visiting my daughters (in college taking Summer classes) to celebrate the birthday of one of them. When deciding on where to go for dinner, one of her friends recommended this restaurant.  What a surprise this little restaurant was!  I understand that the entrance is a bit unconventional, but for me that was part of the charm. We asked to be seated in the back patio, it is MUCH better than the inside seating (which is adequate) with a center fountain and lots of flair. On the way there you walk past a lovely garden of flowers and vegetables.  Everything we ordered was wonderful - we started with Crab Rangoon and Chicken Satay which were both amazing. The Peanut Sauce was very tasty.   For dinner, my Pineapple Fried Rice was the best I've ever had. I ordered that because it is a simple enough dish and I thought at least I would be able to eat it. The surprise is that it was soooo good that the rest of the dining party kept asking me for spoonfuls of it.  My daughter had the Pad Thai (another safe choice) and it was also the best we've had. The other people in the party had dishes that were also very very good.  The dessert blew us away: not the usual choices and very good. I had the pumpkin custard over sticky sweet black rice (YUMMY). My daughters had the coconut-banana roll and loved it. The fourth person had the sticky rice with mango and he was very happy with it.  The service was very good; from the hostess to the server everyone was very friendly and helpful.  Reading the first review on this page I was scratching my head. Did this person go to the same restaurant I did??   I am definitely going back the next time I am in Pittsburgh.",

The pumpkin curry was really good - a bit on the spicy side for a '3', but I'll know that for next time.  These spice levels are all relative to the chef anyhow.  The crab rangoon was probably some of the best I've had - not too fried, not overly creamy - just right. The ONLY complaint I'd have is the tom kha was super sweet and super rich (probably the 'worst' I've had in Pittsburgh...but by NO means was it bad.)  It had good flavor otherwise, so the super sweet coconut milk won't prevent me from getting it, but I'll make sure I have a bit of chicken broth around to water it down a bit.  Of course, that will only work when I get it to go.  I likely won't order if it we are dining there.",

Well, I just tried the North Side location tonight and am SO disappointed!  We ordered three appetizers and two entrees: crispy spring rolls, crab rangoons, Thai shrimp toasts, pork pad thai, and cashew chicken.  There wasn't a single thing I liked.  We did takeout, and the appetizers were all soggy in our 15 minute door-to-plate trip.  The crispy spring rolls had a curry filling which was unexpected and unwelcome.  The crab rangoons had a sickeningly sweet and very soupy filling.  The shrimp toasts had the texture of cold fried tofu or savory Bread pudding chunks:/. And the pad Thai - It may have been the pork that caused the pad thai to be bad... It smelled weirdly like dog food - don't get me wrong, I don't mean they serve dog food; but the smell was bothersome.  I didn't end up eating any of the meat. Lastly, the cashew chicken was waaayy too heavy on the fish sauce.  This is my favorite Thai dish and I couldn't eat it because of the strong fish taste.  I will continue looking for my favorite Pittsburgh Thai restaurant.  So disappointed!",

Spicy Noodle Lunch Special (very good flavor and nice and spicy like I asked for) Pad Thai (a great version!  Peanuts were on the side to make it easy to add as much or as little as you wanted!)  Food was good and service was quick.  Will definitely return!",

    "text": "This place saved my life. I was in PGH for business & the restaurants around my hotel were pretty dismal. A local recommended I check out Nicky's and now I can't stay away!  I eat a ton of Thai food at home in LA and I had very low expectations for Pittsburgh. Nicky's is the real deal. Every time I go I try something different and let the waiter order for me.  The portions are big enough to have a tasty lunch and leftovers for dinner.   The mango chicken curry with brown rice is divine. It's very basic but the mangoes are freshly cut & dropped right into the curry sauce which may not feel right to some people but trust me. I asked for heat level 6 which was just enough to give it a kick & I was not clearing my sinuses every two minutes. I've also loved the garprow chicken lad kao.  It was spicy, delicious and the egg on top brought another savory element to the mix. Every dish I get has chicken and here it's the real deal. It's lean & good so don't worry about weird grisly meat.  The only bummer was their pad kee mow, or spicy basil leaves. For some reason every Thai place in Pittsburgh serves it with very little basil and a bland gravy... much different that anything else I've experienced.  If you're on the north side, tuck yourself into Nicky's. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "On a recent trip back to the burgh in June,  we had already had Thai at our usual hangout and decided to go out for Thai a second time.  Being that NTK had made the top 25 restaurants in the burgh, i had to try it. So we made a rez and headed over.  Let's start by saying it is in an interesting neighborhood.  They are rehabbing lots of houses so there is some other activity on the street.  But it is a teenie tiny little house converted to a restaurant.  When you enter, you will look at those front steps and think \"it's not too late to turn around\" - but ignore the cracked steps and keep going.  Then you enter the house and walk down a long hallway when you think \"i should have turned around at the steps\" but keep walking.  When they seat you, you immediately realize that you are in a tiny little dining room and it is rather cozy.  And then - the menu comes.  Wow. Just wow.  Yeah, they have pad thai. and they have curry. and they have rad na noodles. and then they have lots of other choices - vegetarian, thai-hesitant (for those who don't like thai or are fearful of thai), and just some really really cool dishes.  So here goes the rundown of what was ordered.  The appetizer dog choice was the fresh spring rolls. So how do you differentiate yourself from the competition?  Slice them into manageable chunks so that they can be shared easily and dipped into that Yummy  dipping sauce.  I start with me as I can't rave enough about what I had.  Phar Luck Chicken.  it was a plate of steamed veggies (gr beans, snow peas, broccoli) covered with rice noodles, chicken breasts that were lightly spiced, then a peanut sauce on top.  I ordered a level 5 not knowing how it would be as one restaurant's 5 is another one's 3or 7.  Veggies were nicely steamed and crisp.  The chicken was mildly spiced atop a bed of noodles. And finished with a medium spiced peanut sauce. Just enough to taste but not over soaked.  And the surprise?  Two shrimps and some lump crabmeat.  Ok chef - one comment here. I loved the seafood but I know not everyone can eat that so including something that can trigger an allergic reaction without disclosing it can lead to disaster. And no customer would ever assume to ask about shrimp in a chicken dish.  Maybe add it to the description or have waitstaff mention it when it is ordered?  DH had green curry with chicken.  Lots of veggies, nicely spiced but nothing out of the ordinary.  It was good but maybe not as strong of a curry taste as he was used to.  But it held its own with the other Thai restaurants.  DSS had crab pineapple fried rice.  Ok. Seriously. How could you not love that combo. It took self-restraint on my part to not just grab that plate from him. Now THAT was an unusual combo I have never seen elsewhere and according to DSS, it was great (first sign of a good dish?  No offers to share :)  Our server was excellent.  Never was a water glass empty.  plates were removed promptly. We were never rushed as we lingered in conversation.    So this is now added to my \"places to visit when back in the burgh\" list.  7/16. Update. I decided while back in the burgh again on business to revisit NTK.  I ordered takeout to nibble back at the hotel.  A few comments.  1.  The Phar Luck was as good as I remembered.  Yum again 2.  I passed on an appetizer so I could Try their sticky rice with custard.  Imagine my surprise when I opened it and discovered black sticky rice....oh my....wow.  Topped with a square of creamy smooth custard topped with coconut.  Again the little details that make NTK just stand out from the pack. 3.  I was surprised to be charged a surcharge for a takeout order.  Seriously? Each item was marked up for the privilege of saving them the salary they pay their waitstaff when I took the food out. No, it is not a big deal (a little over 10% or so). Again, disclosure would have been nice. Or no surcharge at all. 4.  Speaking of takeout, chef, how about using some of that surcharge to pay for decent plastic ware? I don't do chopsticks and found that it was impossible to spear the steamed veggies with those dollar store forks. Since I was in a hotel without a kitchen, that was the only fork I had and when it snapped in the broccoli....well....let's just say it wasn't pretty.  So maybe think about some decent flatware, so I don't need to pack my own next time I get takeout?",

My date and I had lunch on a Friday and the only seating available was in the garden. It was a chilly day but that didn't stop the Burgh's Thai lovin' crowd! Nicky's also posted up a few standing heaters to keep the patrons warm, if their spicy food didn't do the trick.  Before I got to the restaurant, my date ordered green tea. To our disappointment, it never came. The lunch rush was in it's prime so we opted not to re-order the tea. For starters, we ordered the Tom Yum soup, Thai spring rolls (the cold, non-fried ones,) massaman curry with shrimp and spicy basil noodle with steamed tofu and vegetables. Our spice level ranged from 7 for the Tum Yum soup and curry to an 8 for the spicy basil noodles. I am a huge spicy food fan so I am happy to report that Nicky's got it right this time. I've discovered that it's a hit or a miss with a spicy level of 8 actually being an 8. All of the entrees include either soup or salad. Simple chicken and rice soup and the salad is mixed greens (mostly iceberg, unfortunately) with a tomato, single piece of pineapple, ground peanuts & sweet ginger dressing. Along with the spicy level being on point, our food was delicious. I have never had a bad meal from Nicky's! The portion sizes are enough for two meals. I love that patrons can really get their money's worth at Nicky's :)   Our service wasn't the best but with the mass of people there for lunch, I didn't make the less than attentive service an issue.  If you head over for lunch, keep in mind that this place gets very busy. It IS worth the wait, especially the outdoor garden!",

We waited about 15 mins around 1:45 pm and boy, was it worth it! We ate chicken pad Thai, beef noodle soup and Thai fried rice. We went light on the heat (6) since our little girl was with us, but we could have stepped up a level I think. The food was amazing and my husband declared it the best pad Thai he's had.

The dining area was already nearly full, and by the time we left people were cramming the hallway waiting. I got the tom kha (which was nice) and my boyfriend got pad thai, not being familiar with thai food and unsure what to try. We ordered spice level 9/10 after being heavily warned by our waiter not to do 10/10; he convinced us to get the spice tray instead, since it's easier to add spice than remove it. Well... after tasting our food, we both hit up the spice tray pretty hard, so I was expecting a little spicier! But overall it was good. (Warning for those reading: we are probably more accustomed to spicy food than the average pittsburgher.)",

    "text": "Nicky's Thai Kitchen (in both the downtown and northside location) has some seriously great Thai food. Nice restaurant ambiance with plenty of different selections to chose from. Lots of vegetarian options, which is something I am always looking for! I particularly love the Pad See Ew.  I'm actually writing this review just to point out a weird thing this place does... in both locations... you can't go more than 3 minutes without someone filling up your water. I think management has told them that people always need to have a full glass of water but the amount of times they refill your glass is actually disruptive. It's a running joke between my husband and to see how many times they will fill up the water! Sometimes they even top of the water after they already filled it up and I haven't even sipped it yet. Both husband and I try to move our glasses to the back of the table and stop drinking water so that they stop disrupting our meal to fill our water glasses.  So next time you are at Nickys Thai Kitchen, count how many times your water glass gets refilled. We can't be the only people this happens to. I'm thinking about starting to ask for a pitcher of water on the table so they quit with water barrage.",

Although the hours state that it is open all day - at least on Saturdays - do not be fooled.  They are closed until 5 PM for dinner; there was a line of people waiting at the door 20 minutes prior to that time.  Parking is on the street, so it could be a problem, but was available on the evening of our visit.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  The dining area is attractive, but extremely noisy, with tables set very close together.  We were unable to have anything resembling a pleasant conversation.  The Crab Rangoons were excellent although the sauce could have been kicked up a notch in seasoning.  My husband and I judge every Thai restaurant by its Pad Thai, so he ordered Chicken Pad Thai and I ordered Shrimp.  Both were very good, but the sauce was too sweet for our liking.  (We prefer a savory flavor.)  All in all, we had a good dinner, but the excessive noise will keep us from returning.",

    "text": "I have always heard great things about this place and have several friends who always give it huge accolades.  We decided to go to dinner here this past week with those same friends.  Expectations were extremely high, so high that you can easily be disappointed, however, that was not the case....not even close.  This place met and exceeded all expectations (mine anyway).  Located on the North Side, it would be very easy to pass the place when driving by.  Even if you did see it, by looking at it you may not stop in.  I would not blame you, but that would be a mistake.    Our party of 7 was promptly seated in the outdoor garden.  It was a tad brisk that night, but the outdoor seating is covered and they do have large heaters, so it was perfectly fine sitting outside.  The garden is a very relaxing environment and really set the tone.  The dinner menu is fairly robust to begin with, offering plenty of soups, salads and appetizer options.  On this night, we let our friends do the picking of the apps and they were spot on.  We started with an appetizer special, which was a combo platter of an assortment of appetizers including small crispy egg rolls, chicken satay, and I want to say small steamed dumplings ( am missing two items but for the life of me I cannot remember exactly what they were, but let it be known, the plate was empty).  We also got the Samosa appetizer which was delicious.  The main entree list is expansive, very expansive and I find myself wanted to try pretty much everything on the list.  All entrees can either come with seafood, chicken, pork, tofu, beef, shrimp or vegetarian style.  You can also determine the style of 'hotness' you would like your dish cooked at on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the hottest).  I opted for the Pork Ginger on a level 8.  It was absolutely fantastic!  This place is also BYOB, so that is an added bonus.  The staff was very friendly, prompt and willing to answer and questions.    I would highly recommend hitting up Nicky's, it really is fantastic food and the prices are extremely affordable.",

Crab rangoon and spring rolls are great ways to start the chow session. Usually able to get in, order, eat and pay within an hour if you're going on a lunch break. Flavors are great here and the wait staff is pretty consistent with refilling water but often forget if you order a different drink. Spice levels range from 1-10 or 1-5 depending on the waiter. Ask for them to bring out the sauce tray for even more flavor. You used to get larger portions where you would almost always have some left to take home, but they've decreased the amount of food given. You also get even less food if you order takeout. Save the rangoon for last! Be careful sitting by the front window as there are almost always flies buzzing around up there.",

For under $20 you are treated to a large portion of perfectly seasoned and spicy noodles, sprouts, and chicken. The spice level ranges from 1-10, which really allows each person to tailor the dish to what suits them. The more you go back, the better understanding you get of the spice levels.  Overall i could not be more pleased with all facets of Nicky's truly a treat each time i order.",

The curry was excellent (ordered at spice-level 10) and was not overly spicy despite this. It had plenty of thinly sliced duck, potatoes a side of rice and a tiny shrimp puff. The flavor was quite good and had a wonderful creamy texture.  The condiments were also welcome as the fish sauce/hot peper/garlic combination added some extra heat to the dish.",

Anyways, I was pretty impressed with Nicky's; It's hard to distinguish between the two, for me at least. The service and quality of food at both were on the same level - excellent.  I mean, the service alone was just outstanding. Super attentive and very accommodating.  On top of that, the most important thing is obviously the food. I'll admit the only entree I've had each time I go here is the curry. It comes in this great metal bowl with a side of rice. For me the flavor is a 10. I usually get around a 7 on the spice level. I got 9 once and my face hurt, and certain parts of the next day weren't pleasant. But. If that's your thing, go for it!  I've also had the thai toast appetizer, which are yummy little bites of fried pork served with a vinegary sauce. And the thai tea, good strong flavor, no complaints.   Last time I went, I was with someone who is obsessed with thai food, and he said it was on his top two thai places he's ever had, so I'll take his word for it... can't wait to come back!",

I got like two pieces of chicken amongst a soup of flavorless pineapple curry and one tiny scoop of rice!  Way OVERPRICED and tasted awful.  No THANKS will not be returning.  Anyways we always have to get take out because it's a terrible cramped uncomfortable spot to eat.  Not worth it anymore. It's worth the drive to Bloomfield to get some better Thai!",

    "text": "I've recently begun eating Thai food and can't seem to get enough. Pittsburgh, for whatever reason, has plenty of Asian influenced cuisine options so I seize the opportunity to eat Thai as often as I can. I must admit, Nicki's is my favorite.   Tonight I dined plus one; we shared the samoas appetizer followed by green curry with chicken and shrimp pad thai. What really impressed me was the pad thai (typically left underwhelmed). Generally, I find the rice noodles quickly soak up the sauce and you're left with a chewy, greasy dish. Not here! Plus, they finely chop the peanuts which gives each bite a nice even consistency.  Not only is the food fresh and flavorful but presentation can't be beat. Curries come in decorative golden dishes with burnetts to keep the food warm. Portion sizes are generous, perfect for sharing. The restaurants decor is adorable - patio diners are surrounded by plants, fountains, and Asian inspired statues which enhance the experience.   In addition to accepting reservations, indoor/outdoor dining is available upon request and staff are accomodating to parties. This joint is BYOB so don't forget the wine! Upon my last visit we brought three buckets of sangria and the plesant (and efficient) staff only charged us for one cork fee. Side note: I believe the staff is on tip share, something to keep in mind when the bill comes.   Whether searching for a quiet dinner get away, a date night, or even a group get together coupled with a delicious (and fairly priced) menu I think you'll find what you're looking for in Nicki's kitchen.",

    "text": "This place is one of the best Thai food restaurants I've ever been to in terms of flavor.  The appetizers...yes I love them.   Spring Rolls were flavorful and the dipping sauce was heaven.  Crab Rangoon (C.R.) is my barometer for most every type of Asian cuisine that I encounter.  My friend, when you buy this version of C.R. it will ruin every other C.R. you have ever or possibly will ever eat.  The shell, unlike most C.R. shells, is soft and easily opened revealing the sweetness within. The filling: sweet, decadent and creamy with seasonings I've never experienced in such a simple appetizer.  I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore, but whenever I'm in town this is what seduces me to come back to Nicky's Thai the most.  Ok, Ok on with the rest of the review...  Nicky's has a spice rating from 1-5. Usually, most menu's \"spicy\" is a mild to me (raised eating habaneros), but this spice is legitimate.   A friend of mine recommended I start with a Pad Kee Mao with a rating of 3 or less. I chose the 3 and boy am I glad I did. It was like fire in my mouth in a good way. The sauce on the noodles was not overwhelming and it left me licking the crevices of my mouth for any residue goodness.  Even after the meal the small cup of sherbert they serve makes me warm, while ironically cooling my still smoldering lips from the entree.  What more can I say if I speak of the curry dishes, the tofu dishes, the other desserts.  Just try it and taste the greatness for yourself!   Maybe you'll even see me there.    I'll be the guy stretched out on an outdoor patio seat holding a Crab Rangoon puff in the air and nodding my head approvingly.",

I usually get take out since but have eating in the restaurant.  Nice outdoor seating in the warm months, but inside it can get loud.  The only negative aspect of the menu i can think of is that the appetizers are nothing special and can be skipped and the spicy level is not consistent between dishes.  You can request the spicy level you want but a 7 one day might seem like a 3 another day.  Food is still great though!  FYI bring you own beer/wine.  There is a bar on the coner that sells six packs and also a wine bar close buy where you can grab a bottle.",

Sitting outside on the back patio is really lovely, as it really does feel like a little oasis.   I had the red curry, which was excellent. Spiced perfectly and the vegetables were just cooked enough, but not mushy. The jasmine rice was also well prepared (I loathe mushy rice). I also had the spring roll, which was easily the best spring roll I ever had, with the balance of cilantro and basil perfectly complimenting the noodles and vegetables. The dipping sauce was also light, without veering into sickly sweet territory.   My husband had the noodle curry which was AMAZING. I like my curry, but kept trying to steal his. Again, perfectly cooked vegetables and the rice noodles also weren't overcooked. However, Nicky's has only four levels of hotness--mild, medium, hot and thai hot. I ordered hot and my husband ordered medium, and his dish was easily as spicy as mine.   Our two dinner companions ordered the chef special soft-shell crab, which I wasn't overly impressed with, but it wasn't bad, necessarily. The coating for the crab was a little greasy and a little soft.   The wonton soup which everyone else ordered was very delicious. The broth was extremely flavorful and the wontons were so light and well seasoned. I could eat buckets and buckets of the stuff.   They were quick to refill water glasses and attentive in their service. I wish I lived here so I could get takeout from here all the time. I would recommend for fresh, quick and extremely flavorful thai food.",

The dining room is very \"cozy,\" and the table I was sitting at experienced an icy cold draft from outside which forced me to wear my coat  through dinner. The servers were not very attentive, but I'll assume that was because of the holiday rush.  On the plus side, the menu had many interesting choices, and the quality of the food seemed decent. I think I was expecting the best Thai food ever due to all the positive reviews, but I came away thinking it was no better than the other Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. On the other hand, it wasn't really any worse either.  To sum it up, since the North Side is a bit of a drive for me, I probably won't be back, but if I lived in the neighborhood I would certainly give it another try.",

It was too high to eat directly out of the bowl, but since it was a bit soupy, I couldn't exactly move it onto my plate.

    "text": "Boy, has this place gone downhill. When I moved to the North Side of Pittsburgh in 2009 I was excited to discover that a Thai place was within walking distance, and that it was pretty good! Over the next couple of years I'd order from Nicky's occasionally and the quality of the food seemed to slide. I just got takeout from Nicky's for the first time in a while. It was packed, with a bunch of people waiting outside for a table. I ordered Pad Thai and a mango salad. The salad was disappointing - the pineapple in it actually tasted fermented and not in a good way. The Pad Thai was straight up disgusting. As hungry as I was I couldn't finish it. After a few forkfuls all I could taste was SALT and a sour vinegar-ish flavor. Sorry Nicky's, good for you for having throngs of customers and a new downtown location, but I'll drive across town for Thai takeout before I walk down the street for your nasty food ever again. Yuck.",

    "text": "Nice, cozy, warm, and a little surprise outdoor seating area. We came very early around 5.10 pm on Wednesday. Entrance is a bit crampy, but, once you are seated, and look around, you'll feel warm and fuzzy. Because we came is early, the place is still empty, except for the four of us. Then, slowly tune in your ears to the soft, exotic Thai music in the background. There is a door leading to the outdoor seating area. The alley leading back to the outdoor seating is nicely decorated, green with plants, and some waterfalls added to the serenity of the area.   We ordered the Crispy Egg Rolls for starter. It came in 6 pieces, and they tasted wonderfully crisp, no oily feeling. Dip it to the fish sauce that came with it, to add a bit of tangy, yet sweet after taste. Next, we ordered the house salad. They tasted fresh, and crunchy, and add to that, the fish sauce, to bring more exotic flavour to it.  For entree, we ordered the Pad Thai with chicken. It tasted a bit salty,  yet the chicken are tender, and easy to bite, unlike some other Thai restaurant I've been to. The Thai Iced Teas were ordered along with the food order, however, they came after we reminded the hosts 3x..  Nevertheless, the food is better than average Thai restaurant I have been, and the ambiance of the restaurant is nice to go back again for a second visit next time.",

Other dishes were ok, but didn't stand out.  These included: Beef Noodle Soup, Massaman Curry, Red Curry, Pa Ram Chicken, and the Somosa, and Steamed Dumpling appetizers.  The place was full by 7:30 Saturday night, so you should probably make a reservation.",

The waiter was super sweet and friendly and recommended a dish for my mom to order... Basil something, with chicken and rice. I forget the name, but it's one of the specialties. She was ballsy though and ordered it a bit too hot even though the waiter warned her... The dish started at a 2 or 3. I of course got the pumpkin tofu curry AGAIN (I have issues) and it was a home run. Great amount of pumpkin, tofu, all mixed in the lovely coconut-y sauce. Heaven. This is my new favorite place to take people!",

    "text": "I am just getting into Thai food and I do have to say that Nicky's Thai Kitchen is getting me hooked on.    First, I am impressed with the interior of the restaurant.  While walking in, I thought this was just some cheap restaurant that my friends dragged me to.  But the moment I walked into the dining area, I couldn't stop looking around.  This place was TINY.  Super tiny but it was nicely decorated EXCEPT for the chairs.  The chair corners kept stabbing me in the legs.  I love their Tom Kha Soup.  The bowl was large, it was rich and all the vegetable in it made me feel good to eat it.  I also had their Pad See Eaw with beef.  It reminds me of Beef Chow Fun but with a sweeter taste (and less oil).    I also had their Basil Duck and Seafood Noodle.  The Seafood Noodles were good but I didn't prefer it over the previous two dishes.  I wasn't impressed with their Basil Duck but did love eating all the vegetables from the dish.  Their Thai iced tea was good but isn't the best I've had.  I could be a tiny tiny bit sweeter.  If it is your first time, try the Tom Kha Soup and Pad See Eaw.  As a college student, I found this place moderately priced.  Definitely wasn't cheap.  If you're eating by yourself here, you'll be out a pizza and some wings.",

The servers are very friendly and know very well about the foods (which sounds odd but some restaurant EEs dont know much about the foods they are serving). I usually go there with a group of friends to share appetizer plate, tom yam soup, main and a dessert. Anything with basil is my personal favorite. it is BYOB.",

    "text": "Awesome authentic Thai food. I had the spring rolls as an appetizer and the Pad Thai with chicken as my entree. Both very delicious. I like that you can tell them how spicy you want it based on a scale of 1-10. Just be careful, my friend who loves spicy food got her meal at a 6 and it was very spicy. I got my pad thai at a 4 and it was perfect. What i also LOVE is that its BYOB. $5 corking fee but totally worth it. BYOB restaurants with great food can be rare. My only dislike is how small the north side location is. There is absolutely zero space to wait, just a crammed hallway so my recommendation is to make a reservation. I did hear the downtown location is much bigger. The service was great, we stayed an hour after our food to drink some wine and no one rushed us out. I am definitely going back and telling all of my friends!",

The food however was just fair. Started off witht the vegetable dumplings-the dipping sauce was great but the dumplings were doughy and the center quite mushy. Then had the Tom Yom soup and ordered an 8 spicy but was more like a 15 and almost not edible. We order spicy between 8 and 9 everywhere we go so it's not like we want mild-we likd spicy. They merely sprinlked red hot pepper flakes onto  and into the soup. The soup looked good but was hard to eat. The tomatoes were not cooked and the pieces too large to fit in the mouth. Did not finish it. The green curry tofu was very light and weak with little curry and little flavor. The broth was thin. Also ordered this one an 8 spicy but it was more like a 3. The fried basil rice was good but the rice was overcooked and mushy. The coconut ice cream was the best part of the meal. I don't think we will retrun.",

I had the spicy green bean and peppers and it was seriously some of the best food I've ever tasted.

Flavor balance was way off.   The dishes tended to be a bit too sweet with little subtlety in the flavors, even when ordered with a medium to hot level of spiciness.    Pumpkin Curry was a disappointment - hard chicken, bland squash.    Outdoor seating is great, indoors is pretty packed, but overall a fun place to go.",
