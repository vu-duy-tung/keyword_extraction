They use legit-style Tofu! Oh mercy me, I'm gettin' the vapors just thinkin' about it!  I have to give them credit for that.  Also, the reasonably-priced lunch special really saved the day on a hungover Saturday morning.  BUT let us not think the entire picture has changed.  I'd like to dock them half a star if I could, because they charged me $2 for an egg roll! Insaaaaaane! It wasn't even that good.",

    "text": "People who reviewed this place as being GOOD... obviously retain the taste buds of a snake (fyi: snakes have no taste buds).  Came here with my parents while we were scoping out apartments for me to live in. Wanted to go to Pamela's, but the line was too long so we walked a few doors down to China Palace. I was REALLY wary because I did a quick Yelp search before we walked in, but my dad insisted that it was probably \"not that bad\".  Here's what we ordered: - Cheese wontons (Um... they literally just fried american cheese in the wontons. Who does that?! It's supposed to be CREAM CHEESE!! And they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in.) - Chicken Lo Mein - Beef Lo Mein - Shrimp and Broccoli w/ Sweet and Sour Soup (The soup was the most disgusting texture of I-don't-know-what. Needless to say, that was left untouched.)  Let's just say, not only did it take 30-40 minutes to get our food (for food that was of LESSER quality than Chinese takeout), the food itself was just utterly disappointing... A complete travesty to Chinese cuisine. It was bland, yet greasy and MSG-ridden (if that makes any sense). Not only that, they also didn't have BEEF CHOW FUN (ok, so whoever claims this restaurant serves \"authentic\" Chinese food clearly has no clue on what they're talking about). And the kicker? It came out to about $32 + tip for food that we DIDN'T even finish half of. We literally just got up mid-meal when we overheard the table behind us complaining about how they found a dead fruit fly in their bowl of rice.  DO NOT GO HERE!!! ... unless you're a snake that is.",

I guess the trick here is that they have both authentic food and Americanized food. I never tried the Americanized dishes but the Chinese ones are decent. I always just order their specials, which are listed on the first page of their menu.  My favorite dishes are:  Chinese style mapo tofu,  Beijing duck (you need to order it ahead),  fish with the spicy sauce (The spicy flavor does not just come from the spicy dry red peppers but also sichuan peppers. It has a special tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug.),   and the pork stir fry with bamboo shoots.",

In the West Coast, it's glazed with coconut and its supposed to be sweet, but in this restaurant, its salty and does not have any coconut flavor, so I don't order it anymore.

It was cheap, fast, and the service was good but the food just didn't wow me.  There was nothing WRONG with it, but it was just middle-of-the-road americanized Chinese lunch special.  (Which I suppose I can't complain about, since I knew that when I ordered it.)  That being said, this Chinese place has an amazing vegetarian selection!  I'm not just saying that because I moved from Omaha, beef capital of the universe.  I ordered General Tso's tofu for lunch--and I could have ordered General Tso's soy protein!  Ha!  I would come back here, maybe, if I was looking for a quick bite in Shadyside.  But for now I think I'll stick to trying other Chinese places in the 'Burgh.",

The food is averaged-priced for a Chinese restaurant which is a nice touch, being that it is located in Shadyside. I always have leftovers too-their proportions are huge!  The beef with scallions is delicious and so is the cheese wontons. The chicken lettuce wraps are pretty good too. The sweet and sour chicken was okay...the chicken was great but I found the sauce to be a little stickier than I prefer (maybe it's just me though).I do wish they would have crab rangoons though.

    "text": "I think I actually want to give China Palace four stars, but I am not sure yet...   I avoided this place for awhile because of its generic sounding name. Once I saw the extensive menu, with vast vegetarian selections, I realized that there is hope for a vegetarian in need of a quick fix. And I have found the food to be well above average American-Chinese takeout .   I really like the chewy consistency of their soy protein. I am a fan of chewy...I know it's not for everybody.   They do have brown rice! At least, they do now, and it's mighty good. A little chewy, too.   Last night, I tried the \"Sizzling Sensation\" wheat gluten (mock beef). The sauce was not as spicy or peppery as I would have liked, but it was flavorful and the texture of the gluten was pleasantly soft and chewy (not as hard as the soy protein, though my dining companion who is not a fan of the chewy likened it to gristle). I also had the broccoli with garlic sauce, which is the dish I usually count on in Chinese fare, and it was a delicious compliment to the other dish. Unlike the broccoli and garlic sauce of most places, the broccoli was not swimming in goop and it actually tasted garlicky and even tangy. The broccoli was crisp and fresh. The meal was entirely satisfying and I will order both of these dishes again.   Speaking of dishes, one entree that I can warn against is the \"Taro Bowl A-La-King.\" Looks and tastes as if cooked in dish water...   If you do not like greasy food, order from the selection of steamed dishes, or \"weight watchers\" items. That goes for just about anywhere!   Delivery from China Palace has been quick in my experience, almost unbelievably so! In-house service is also quick and notably friendly.",

A good portion of their menu is populated by items such as General Tso's Chicken and Moo Shu Chicken, but there are also more authentic dishes such as Szechuan Water Boiled Beef (shui zhu nio) and Yu xiang Eggplant.  Personally I have to say the Water Boiled Beef is both the best Water Boiled Beef I've had in Pittsburgh and also the best dish I've had at China Palace, I like all my spicy dishes with extra spicy.  Their Americanized offerings are also cooked pretty well, definitely better than take out restaurants.  Contrary to popular belief, China Palace actually has a Taiwanese owner and not an American owner.  China Palace is nice as you can go there with people with more Americanized palates if you have a more Asian palate, or vice versa, and you can please everyone.  Prices run from around 9 dollars to upper teens for some of the chef's specials.  Highly Recommended.",

It's a little sweet, but not too oily. I can't vouch for their meat dishes, as the person I went with is also veg. They really manage to create satisfying, typical Chinese dishes, with meat substitutes that would fool most meat eaters.  It's definately expensive, we paid $40 for three entrees and a salad. And there's other Chinese food that's just as good for less money. But for vegetarians who miss \"typical\" dishes, China Place is so the place to go!",

    "text": "After searching around Pittsburgh for the kind of Chinese food that can fill the void for Golden Chopsticks in Wheeling, I finally had a stroke of luck and found this place based on another Yelper's review.   As a vegetarian, having so many options in one restaurant can be quite novel. Their menu is extensive, for both meat and vegetarian dishes. Oh, and the soups! There's veggie wonton, egg drop, corn soup, and vegetarian hot and sour! JOY! The entrees list is far too long to get into, but I'll say that proteins include tofu and soy protein \"meat\". My personal favorite and go-to entree is kung pao soy (it is really good with extra spice if you like that sort of thing) and veggie wonton and egg drop soups are my favorite. A nice pot of tea accompanies your visit and the entree potions are large enough to share if you are in the sharing mood. They also have a large lunch menu that includes a big portion of the dish you order and a soup.  The atmosphere at China Palace is pretty relaxed and calming, with minty green walls and dark cherry-stained chairs. The dining room is spacious and can easily accommodate groups of 10-12.   Vegetarians, if you are feeling unsure about what is in your dish, look for the manager (owner maybe?) who seems to be a constant fixture there and who has a complete knowledge of the menu items. He'll gladly quell your fears and help you out with trustworthy information.",

I literally still have enough for 2 more meals. With a total of $22.50, it was the best quick & tasty Sunday dinner for a non-meat eater!",

    "text": "I only go to two Chinese restaurants in Pgh and this is one of them. They offer an impressive Vegetarian Menu with soy protein, wheat gluten, and tofu. They have a nice lunch special too that features several dishes from their regular veg menu, including vegetarian hot and sour soup.  The atmosphere is nice and the place looks much nicer inside than you would expect from the outside. The waitstaff is both nice and attentive and because I eat here a lot, they remember me.   My boyfriend is neither vegan nor vegetarian but almost always orders soy protein, his favorite is the Orange Soy Protein.   I recommend the Kung Pao Soy Protein for lunch and Shredded Heaven for dinner. Seriously, you need to try the Shredded Heaven. It's comprised of wheat gluten (seitan), tofu, bamboo shoots, and an assortment of other awesome things.",

The rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy \"pork\". It tasted nothing like pork, or meat for that matter. I tried adding soy sauce for some kind of flavor but dear lord that didn't help. The soup was a weird creamy mess. My friend got the general tso chicken, which should generally be a safe choice. WRONG. cardboard. Cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster. Seriously we've never been so grossed out that we had to throw out $20 worth of food but that's what happened.",

The staff was helpful and prompt to bring a straw for my daughter to have her water. We shared a palace duck, which consists n boneless strips of duck with stir fried veggies (broccoli, baby corn, bamboo, the usual) covered with sauce. It was not memorable but definitely heartwarming and a good choice for a quick Sunday family lunch. We also had fried pork dumplings for appetizer and egg drop soup, which were average.  The general Tso chicken we spotted on another table seemed to be a popular choice and looked tasty; next time we will try that one for sure.",

Rick had to teach a night class and Mom had a meeting to go to.  Besides, I hadn't been here since my last review.  Yeah, I know the chow here is Americanized Chinese food.  Who cares--it's great stuff!    Now when eating Chinese, you should never begin by diving in to your main course right away.  First you've gotta have some soup and some egg rolls!  Dad and I both began with some r-e-a-l-l-y good hot-n-sour soup.  Man, that was good-n-bold.  Warmed my insides right away!  Now I know that vegetable spring rolls are supposedly better for you.  Yeah right--what's a great Chinese dinner without some good old fashioned egg rolls?  I like to put a spoonful each of sweet-n-sour sauce, duck sauce, and hot Chinese mustard on my plate, dipping my egg roll in a different one with each bite!    I love the names of some of their specialties here, including the Triple Crown, Three Afire, Sizzling Trio, and the Royal Match.  Feeling a little adventurous--and why not:  the old man was paying--I went for the Jaded Affair.  Yum, scallops and shrimp marinated in white sauce.  Usually seafood isn't my first choice.  My dad went for the Kung Pao Chicken.  I've got to give him credit--how a guy his age can eat that and not reach for the Mylanta is beyond me!",

It's pretty much straight forward American Chinese food, not amazingly authentic or True to actual Chinese cuisine, but good enough for our western taste buds.",

The girl on the phone couldn't find out order (but swore she remembered entering it into the computer) eventually she did find it and said it had been fulfilled. I asked if it was out for delivery and she couldn't tell me. She couldn't tell me how much longer we would wait. She provided no reassurance; she provided frustration. The delivery driver arrived about 30 minutes later. All of the food was cold; when I called back to share this information, I received a lackluster apology from the same girl and she hung up. It wasn't the deliver driver's fault - we understood that he had a lot of orders. But plan ahead - it's a holiday. Call in additional drivers. Have back up plans. Forewarn customers of wait times before they order.  It's changed our view of a restaurant we used to enjoy.",

They used fake crab in their crab and corn soup which was basically hot water thickened with corn starch with some chicken fat from a melt capsule with egg white dropped in and a minute amount frozen corn and peas. This was a tasteless, unseasoned, unsalted -terrible. Zero stars.  Our entrees were only fair at best. My Kung Pao shrimp was peppery but had mostly celery with a few pieces of red pepper and some mushrooms with very few peanuts. Generous amount of tender shrimp. The sauce was oddly, overly sweet and it was the same for sauce on my husband's hot grilled shrimp, chicken and beef with veggies. My sauce had bottled hot sauce added to the brown sauce.   Service was friendly. The restaurant was very clean.  This is why there are 2 stars instead of one.  We only went here cause Pamela's was jammed and had a long wait. This was 2x the cost and bad food.  In addition they had 3 beef dishes and 4 INTESTINE dishes listed under vegetables/tofu specials. Seriously.",

The won-ton soup is vegan friendly too, at least that's what the server told me. Portion sizes are generous, the soy protein is to die for and the price is right. This place is a little piece of heaven for vegetarians and vegans, but omnis won't know the difference.  I've visited this location a handful of times, and each experience has been nothing but pleasant. I have tried the fried mushrooms, the sesame soy protein, the orange soy protein, the sweet & sour soy protein, the wheat gluten veggie mix, the general tso soy protein and the hot and sour soup.   My favorite is the sesame soy protein, but I plan to try all of the soy protein dishes at some point. The wheat gluten is tasty, but it's not the best I've ever had. I prefer the meaty and solid texture of the soy protein over tofu and wheat gluten.   The spicy dishes are never spicy. You can always ask for extra chile paste like I do though. It's weird that they aren't spicy enough, but that could be because this area isn't as likely to have a preference for the spicy foods.   My last visit here on April 1st was definitely the most memorable. The sweetest young male was our server. He forgot sesame on our sesame soy protein, and he apologized profusely and fixed it. He kept bringing us refills, especially on my diet coke. Restaurants can be a little stingy with soda refills, but he was generous. He also gave us free rice refills, and since we all love rice, we were immensely grateful. I can't say enough good things about this kid, but I hope the tip we left him conveyed our gratitude.  China Palace is a win for sure!",

I remembered I had an All Menus coupon for takeout, and China Palace was one of the participating restaurants.  This is the friendliest Chinese eatery for a Pittsburgh vegetarian/vegan.  There are tons of dishes with wheat gluten and soy protein in addition to the more standard tofu.  They even offer veggie shrimp on the menu.  I ordered a spinach and seaweed salad, and the Sizzling Sensation, which is wheat gluten and stir-fried vegetables in a very peppery sauce.  The salad was pretty much what you'd expect, and the Sizzling Sensation definitely perked up my taste buds.  I usually love black pepper, but this was a little much for me.  The vegetarian dishes aren't cheap, running around $12-15 for an entree, though the minimum order for delivery is $12.  The portion size provides at least 2, if not 3, servings.  I should also note that I placed this order on Super Bowl Sunday and wouldn't have been surprised if it arrived later than my requested delivery time--but it even arrived a few minutes early.",

I am now 24 (just abouts!) and I still eat at China Palace and love it. You really must come here for their dinner. FAR FAR FAR superior to their lunch!  Portions are fucking massive. And tasty. We spent about $85 for 4 people and still had 2 days worth of leftovers. Hell yes.  PROTIP: If you come here and you secretly wanted to go down the street to Sushi Too instead, rejoice! They are owned by the same people and you can order from Sushi Too if you know what you want (they don't have Sushi Too menus at China Palace, obviously!) They will oblige. That is how cool they are.  Oh, and get the Wonton Soup, Hot Tea, and the Shrimp Soong. You are welcome. ;P",

I'm not expecting anything crazy, but I have had quality American Chinese food and a little flavor/quality goes a long way.  Our delivery order was over $40 for 2 entrees, veggie wonton soup and 2 veggie egg rolls. For the quality of this food, that is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for the quantity and quality of the food. We could have gone to many other places around the city and gotten a quality meal for that price.  We ordered General Tso's and Beef & Broccoli, one $13 and the other $14. I wasn't overly impressed by either... both were pretty bland and nothing to write home about. Honestly I probably wouldn't have been able to tell the difference between the two meats if I was blindfolded... they didn't taste different at all! The broccoli was cooked well and still had a nice crunch to it.  The egg rolls were ok, but it's kind of impossible to mess those up. I was really excited that they had Veggie wonton soup. It had been so long since I've had wonton soup because I don't eat pork, but the broth was extremely bland and I found myself adding a ton of salt and pepper to flavor it.  This is only one of 2 places that will deliver to the Polish Hill area, so it looks like I'll be going for take-out next time.",

One of the dishes was cold, and my Kung Pao chicken seemed as if it was pre made chicken and they just dumped pre made sauce on it; about 50% of the dish was celery, which in my opinion should be a majority of chicken. Our server was not very personable and quickly rushed away from our table as soon as we ordered.  The last time we were here about two years ago it was very good, but I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the service and food this time.",

I got the General Tso chicken which was extremely deep fried but I don't have super high expectations there and hey I wanted fried food which is why I ordered it. One of my dining companions returned a dirty dish. Mine just had water on it so I wiped it clean with a napkin.  Another companion went for the famous Peking Duck. In the menu, the duck is supposed to be served and cut table side. Turns out it was served cut and on the plate there was what seemed like an orange painted chicken. I could imagine it being a very small duck but honestly, it didn't taste a bit like chicken! It wasn't even tasty. Just bland, boiled kind of chicken meat. Did I mention that the duck also comes with a high price tag.  Very disappointed!",

The soup broth was oddly thick and they put the crispy wontons in the soup, so when I went to eat it, there were soggy wonton strips floating around.   The beef? Inedible. It tasted rotten and disgusting. I picked out the broccoli and ate it over my side of rice. I've noticed the Pittsburgh Chinese food scene isn't great but this place is by far the worst. Stay away",

How this place can stay in business in an area that I consider to be more sophisticated is a real mystery.  It was just awful and the service was terrible.  I wanted to have the assorted appetizer platter, but asked if I could substitute one of the items with dumplings.  Our waiter had to ask the manager.  After much whispering, the manager came back to me and told me that I could have dumplings...then I asked if I could get the fried dumplings with that instead of steamed.   Well I was met with an outraged \"NO\"!!!!  It kind of surprised me that I got this kind of reaction.  I was told that the chef would have to fry 2 dumplings just for my platter.  I looked around and there were only 2 other people in the entire restaurant.  Isn't that what they're supposed to do?  Cook food for people to eat?  I would have never asked if I thought it would be such a big deal.    Anyway, the food was not very good.  In fact, it was awful.    Were they having an off day?   I'm not sure they were.   There's never any reason to be rude to your patrons.  No need to ever return.",

Today I went out on a limb and officially ordered my last meal from this restaurant.   Living right down the street this used to be quick and reliable food. They used to have some of my favorite chineese food in the city. I have no idea what happened.  Today, it took an hour and a half to get food that was pretty much inedible. My girlfriend ordered sesame chicken and it tasted like fish. I had chicken and broccoli with limp foul tasting broccoli. One of the better things we ordered was the hot and sour soup which was dull and only slightly offensive. The best thing we ate, apart from the stale fortune cookies, was one of the greasiest egg rolls I ever had. Unfortunately, we threw out most of our entrees.  It's truly sad to see a place that used to be so good lower their standards like this. I will not be ordering here ever again.",

Delicious and plentiful (I'm eating the leftovers today for lunch.) My husband had the General Tsos. It was hot and tasty although a little too sweet for his liking. My daughter ordered rice noodles with tofu and she was pleased. The flavors were mild but that is her preference. Our friend order sweet and sour chicken. Tasty hot pink sauce (the typical) with nice pieces of chicken in a crispy tempura ( the only thing that matters here is that the tempura was still crispy.)

It had the feel of being upscale, elegant interior, wait staff in black slacks and white shirts...the works.  The food then was excellent. Let me just say that time has not been kind to the China Palace.  The slick interior has been replaced by wall clinging booths, hospital green walls, absolutely NOTHING on the walls in the way of atmosphere or art or ethnic cultural representation. I was seated in a booth and I looked to the wall to my right.  Hand prints, specks of food, traces of liquid that had run down the wall. The food certainly has taken an easy ride down hill.  The Cold Sesame Noodles had an aftertaste of some kind of chemical cleaner, the sauce was oil with a dark liquid floating around in the suspension...nothing peanut or sesame or tahini tasting at all.  The egg roll was mediocre.  I ordered probably the safest thing in any Chinese Restaurant...General Tso's Chicken.  I will admit that it was crispy and the sauce was actually tangy.  And I would give it four stars.  However...how do you cook something crispy and still leave it a beige color? My dining partner had Won Ton Soup which had a yellow broth, two won tons and for some strange reason, flat noodles floating on top...This qualifies for the Meh! He ordered Orange Beef which had a great appearance but the eating and chewing capabilities of a tenderized wallet. I was more saddened than disappointed to see a once GREAT restaurant  down scale to a below average enterprise. If you like it, good for you...bon appetit!  But merely take my opinion as advice from someone who had had the best there to someone  who will never return.",

Food was bland; even the dish that was marked with a \"hot and spicy\" symbol was bland and flavorless. The main flavor was the sweet sauce, which was used in great proportions. The atmosphere was just sad.  Head to Squirrel Hill for a nice variety of quality Chinese restaurants.",

I got the Hunan soy protein after seeing a picture of it on yelp. It tasted just as good as it looked. I enjoy the slight ginger taste it had. Everyone agreed it was the best dish we ordered. Even some of our friends who never tried tofu before. Also ordered hot and sour soup because I enjoy it. Theirs was delicious! Perfect amount of spiciness.We were all sharing our food and sampling each other's. The vegetable lo mein was lacking flavor but not bad. I'd say meh and wouldn't order that again. Egg rolls were crisp and delicious. Everyone enjoyed their food! I'd definitely go back just for the Hunan soy protein and hot and sour soup.",

The reviews are so mixed on here that it's really hard to find any consistency. So I'll start off by saying to give this place a shot because reviews won't cut it.  You may have a bad experience, you may have a good one - it's really hard to gauge based on everything here; be adventurous and try it out and then write a review!  For our experience, we ordered steamed dumplings, sweet and sour pork, and chicken fried rice. We unfortunately got sweet and sour chicken instead but it was all still good quality food.  As a New Yorker, the environment felt incredibly similar and reminded me of Asian food \"back home.\"  For the price, I enjoyed the food and had plenty to take home.  For me, I couldn't beat the location to my house and I would definitely come back.",

I got to try the chicken and garlic and general tsao's. The chicken and garlic sauce was good, but I disliked the veggie that they cooked with. Not sure what it was, tasted almost like a bitter celery. I ate all the chicken out of it but left the veggie. It's kind of hard to know what you're going to get since the lunch menu has no description of the dish, just very generic names. The general tsaos sauce was good but the chicken was a little dry. I liked the soups although the hot and sour could have been both hotter and more sour.  It's certainly not the most amazing food, but for convenience and good service, I'll probably return for lunch.",
