Finally I told him I was ready and he said they didn't have any tapioca ready. I asked how long. \"Long time. At least 45 minutes.\"  What? How can you say you are open at eleven if you can't serve your primary product until an hour later? Either prep earlier or open later. What a joke.",

From the dishes that I sampled, including the friend pork chops and fish over rice, the dishes tend to lean toward the more oily side with definite traces of MSG. To be honest, I'm still surprised that it's still in soft opening mode seeing as it's been open for quite some time now ... which really puzzles me. Frequently busy especially during weekdays in the afternoons/early evenings due to its nearby proximity to Pitt and CMU campus so it may take a while to receive takeout orders if you go that route instead of sitting in. While they offer bubble tea, it really quite lacks the consistency that great bubble tea has and the bubbles in general are a hit or miss, either just right or more so than not, way too hard.",

    "text": "If they kept up their quality from when they first opened, I would give it five stars for the braised chicken over rice. It was SERIOUSLY delicious. I actually had rose tea three days in a row. Unfortunately it seems like this location is declining in service and quality.   First Time: Braised Chicken over Rice. The sauce was not too sweet, not too oily, overall delicious. The vegetable was something similar to cucumber and complemented it nicely. Boiled egg, also good. :)  Service: vibe: You are there to get food, not to talk about your day with the people serving you.  I won't take one side over another because frankly it's kind of an American thing to expect someone to chat, and since the food was great, I thought, wow, that was rushed, but boy that was good.  Fourth time onward: Braised Chicken over Rice. The sauce was hot, but the skin on the chicken felt (soggy?) Like the chicken itself wasn't freshly cooked. Not saying that it wasn't, just commenting on the actual taste. Also, it's becoming increasingly oily. The vegetables were store brand frozen vegetables. Boiled egg, same as before.  Service: Previously I felt like they were conspicuous in trying to get customers out to make room for the next batch, which was fine.I understand efficiency and the mentality of this place, so I'm used to having every single detail of the order thought out before going up to the counter, as well as having cash ready.    But the new girl at the counter is rude to the point that it wears on the customers.  Somehow though, the new girl at the cashier doesn't understand that while she doesn't owe customers a smile, the impatience she has gets old.   Where does that leave us?   Rose Tea would retain more regular customers if the quality was consistently good over time. Also, the aggressive service would benefit from a little organization/toning down. If the cashier doesn't like taking orders, that's fine. But she would probably be happier if she wasn't antagonizing everyone that walks through the front door.  At the moment however, I would say take your money to the Porch. Or Salem's Market on penn ave. Or even kai mei (though that's cantonese). Just until Rose Tea gets the message that they won't be popular as long as the experience and food are declining.",

The service is awful even when there are barely any other customers. The main owner, a middle aged man who is always there during the day, will take his sweet time to wash dishes when there is a line of people waiting to go. I understand you need to get to the dishes and other tasks but where are your priorities? I've worked in the food and retail industry before and if I saw a customer waiting, I would take off my gloves and go help her. The owner even had the audacity to snatch the money out of my hand and throw my change on the counter. Oh, did I mention he will obviously glare at you if you ask one of his servers to help you since he's taking freaking forever! This isn't the first time it has happened. I've been here three times and on all occasions the same guy had the nastiest attitude.   Second, we ran into a couple of my boyfriend's colleagues at this cafe and they were not allowed to dine in because the only table available was a three-seater not a two-seater even though it was super tiny. The owner was planning on squeezing three people at that tiny table? how? I'm petite and I even felt uncomfortable thinking about how cramped I would be with two other people. After some haggling, they were able to sit down. How cheap and transparent can they be?   The only good thing about this place is the boba/pearl drinks are consistent with their other location.",

The 2 stars are for the few items that are worth eating on the menu, and maybe the overpriced bubble teas, but not much else is worth praising.   Their food in general tastes better than the likes of OE and definitely Lulu's, but the amount of selection is abysmal. If you're looking for a meal, you only have a choice from around 10 rice dishes or noodle dishes; and of course the fried chicken leg and pork chop are greasy and accompanied by a tiny bit of vegetables in their attempt to recreate an authentic Taiwanese rice dish. It appears as though they are catering more to American tastes, though to their credit the dishes also come with a tea egg.  At least you get quantity over quality. One of the better choices is the zhajiangmian (Peking sauce noodles). While this is actually quite different from the Beijing version of the noodles (their name has nothing to do with the Beijing version of the noodles), their Taiwanese version is not too bad and also comes with a decent amount of vegetables on the sauce and noodles.  Their milk tea is of the same quality as the Rose Tea in Squirrel Hill, pretty decent but pricey as compared to Taiwanese enclaves on the west and east coasts (and hence not really worth it imho). You get a discount on them if you order them with a meal.  My last gripe is that they don't accept card. It was understandable when they first opened, but after half a year now it's just annoying. When every single place around you accepts card in place of cash, you're not going to attract a lot of people if you demand that they carry cash with them.",

    "text": "Rose Tea Cafe, I had really high hopes for you. After the mediocre (nicely putting it) service in the Squirrel Hill location, I was really hoping you'd become more people friendly so costumers would actually want to go to your restaurant.  I rarely give out one stars, but the service was so poor that I feel obligated to. When me and my friend went into Rose Tea, there was a huge clump of people at the door waiting for their food. There were also no seats available. With no clear signs stating that there was a difference between the takeout section, and the sitdown section, when the person serving asked us hurriedly if we were ready to order, we did.   When we tried to sit down, we got yelled at by the waitress. She accused us of trying to cheat them out of tips by ordering take-out and sitting down to eat it. She also told us \"not to speak Chinese\" when we tried to clarify.  Excuse me? If you guys had clearly marked what costumers were supposed to do, or if the waiter had even asked if we wanted to sit down, or order out instead of expecting us to know what to do, we would've been more than happy to accommodate.   Needless to say, this whole experience left a bitter taste in my mouth, and the greasy food couldn't chase that down either.  This restaurant is definitely entering my list of never-to-return places.",

Also, so, so much MSG and oil, I'm drinking a lot of water with this one. Feeling huge. The food left a lot to be desired.  Here's the thing - Rose Tea, since you are what, the 4th Asian restaurant within 100m (Little Asia,. Lulu, Oriental Express), you need to do things different and better. I've heard the boba is good - awesome there. But why would I decide to go there for a meal? I'll probably try the chicken, which my friends like, but other than that, I don't have a compelling reason to return.",

The food costs too much for mediocre quality; the real Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill is much better.   I had the marinated pork over rice;  it is essentially chopped pork, rice, and a boiled egg. The meal was far too salty and I didn't like it very much.  The server recommended the Taro bubble tea, which was \"very very popular.\" They are supposed to have a rich, creamy texture but the one I had was very watery and not sweet. I'll regard this as a anomaly, but overall the experience wasn't worth the cost.",

I didn't asked anything but it doesn't mean I was not pissed off.

Okay! The point is I don't know your store's rule! Though it's a small store for people who live around there but I'm not the one who should know anything about it.

They have a much smaller menu than the other location though, and seem to be more catered towards selling bubble tea. I have come here to eat a few times. The service is like your average Chinese restaurant, they take your order, bring you your food, and bring the bill and nothing extra, but personally I have never cared much about anything beyond the basics of service.  The food here is pretty good, although options are rather limited. I have had the noodles with a pork chop and noodles with chicken and they were both decent. My favorite dish here is the salt and pepper chicken. It's more expensive for the amount you get than the nearby Orient Express but is slightly better in quality. You have to pay extra for the rice to eat it with. I've also had the scallion pancake with egg which is also decent but probably not enough for a meal, but good to get if you come with friends and aren't that hungry. Not the best option for Taiwanese food around, but decent and reasonably priced.",

The bubble tea menu is still extensive, but the food menu is considerably smaller with only a few options in the appetizer and entrees section.  They said they may be expanding their menu later though.  I got the egg scallion pancakes and cold noodles and both were good though a little pricey for being appetizer sizes.  I spent $15 in total for a bubble tea and 2 appetizers.  The green tea bubble tea I got was also good.  The atmosphere is interesting since the way the countertop and cabinets are setup makes this look like a kitchen inside a home rather than a restaurant which is kind of cool.  All the staff were very friendly.  Seating area is pretty limited so I got mine to go and it came out quickly.  UPDATE: I went a 2nd time and got the pork noodle soup to go.  It tasted good, but was really hard to eat as a to go item because they give it to you with the soup base, noodles, and pork all in separate containers!  The soup base container was almost filled to the top so it was impossible to mix in the noodles and pork into it.  Also the pork came as a whole gigantic piece bones and all so it was really difficult to eat (especially with no knife).  I would have preferred to have the pork chopped up and to either put it all in one container or use a bigger container for the soup base so it's possible to mix it all together.  Since this place doesn't have a lot of seating it seems important to have the to go items packaged in a convenient matter.",

They also sell some Chinese bakery items at the counter. There are about five tables that seat two or four people and a counter seating area, and the shop is bright and cutesy--cartoon tapioca pearls are painted on the wall, and your check is delivered in a little pail. The owner is brusque, which doesn't really match the decor, but the waiter is nice.  I usually only get black milk bubble tea here; it's the best I've found in the Oakland area. It has the perfect amount of sugar--not overwhelmingly sweetened--so there's actually tea flavor, and the bubbles have a good texture. They also offer it both cold and hot, though the hot costs a little extra.  I've also tried the taro cake (). It wasn't bad--nicely pan-fried--but the taro flavor wasn't strong.  I plan on trying some of the entrees sometime. Bubble tea is discounted with the purchase of an entree!",

If this place stepped up their sides, it would make such a difference!!",

Taiwanese sausage over rice (Also has marinated pork in this), Eggplant with garlic sauce over rice and Peking style meet sauce noodle are also good, but not as good as the first two.   But their bubble tea is bad. I can taste the power in the drink.",

The cashier is always super nice -- one time I got stood up for a lunch date and she talked with me for about fifteen minutes since traffic was slow, and it made it easier to laugh it off! Their salted pepper chicken is BOMB, and a perfect snack for studying, in my opinion.  I've had their eggplant now, their beef and broccoli, and their braised chicken, and Curry Over Rice is still my personal fave!  Their bubble tea is also really good, I'm not a huge fan of their boba, so I tend to get it without, but it's always made right in front of you!",

    "text": "It was a crazy hot day and we were walking from CMU to the Natural History museum and spotted this bubble tea shop around the corner.  Bubble tea sounded really good so we decided to stop in.  We didn't really look at reviews pior but now that I see it, I understand why the ratings were so low.  The lady behind the counter was impatient for us to order and wasn't very friendly while we tried to decide what we wanted.  She was quick making our order after it was placed though.  The bubble tea came out pretty diluted and a bit on the bland side - I wish they used a stronger tea and maybe less milk?! The boba was good, though not the best I've ever had.  They were maybe slightly overcooked.  The only thing I liked was that the bubble tea wasn't overly sweet - but this is probably more due to the fact that it was diluted and not because they deliberately made it less sweet.  They do not have an option to adjust/choose your sweetness level.  Maybe they are better in their slushy/food options, because there is a dine-in area in the small cafe.  But I don't think I'll drop in again anytime soon.",

Their fried chicken is literally fried chicken - nothing Asian about it at all and doesn't seem like they're trying very hard to emulate True Taiwanese food.   In any other city, I dare say this place would have closed already. But it seems to be hanging on just fine, so keep doing you, Rose Tea. Clearly my expectations were too high.",

The bubble tea is not bad and there are a ton of options. In my opinion, this is the best lunch option I've had so far on that block of Craig street and seems really popular with CMU students.

I did see what some people were eating, and it looked and smelled pretty good.  On to our bubble tea, though - I ordered a black tea and coffee milk bubble tea, hot. It was really good; maybe not to the level that they serve up at those special places in HK, but I thought it was pretty tasty.  My wife ordered taro tea, and it had pretty good taro flavor without being too sweet, but there was hardly any tea flavor to it. It basically just tasted like taro powder, so she didn't end up finishing it.  Overall OK, I might try another flavor if I'm in the area again",

That confirmed my intuition that I must be in the right path towards some Asian food.  As I continue to walk; two more Asian with boba tea!  That confirmed there must be some Taiwanese/Asian food close by. Surely enough, I found the restaurant!   I ordered black pepper beef with noodles.  For $10.00... I'm not sure it's exactly worth the money.  There's literally 6 pieces of meat and one piece of green onion tossed with spaghetti in a pre made black pepper sauce.  Come on... If you're going to claim yourself as Taiwanese food; at least toss it with Taiwanese type of noodles.    The bowl surely fills your tummy, but can probably get better food elsewhere for the same price",

I end up getting their braised chicken over rice, which comes with two large pieces of chicken, and egg, and some rice. Their fish fillet over rice is also among the nicer dishes. I try to avoid their pork dishes since I don't think they are of very good quality. I ended up having tummy issues after eating those twice.   They have some of the rudest service I have ever seen.

Like many of the other reviewers have said, the middle aged guy behind the counter is pretty rude. The older lady that works at Rose Tea is also really rude - seems like she lives with a constant chip on her shoulder. I remember that during the first time I came to Rose Tea, the older lady basically *told* us we need to tip them. Excuse me?  I only come here when there's nothing else around for lunch. Normally I get the eggplant in garlic sauce, but the most recent time I got that dish it tasted absolutely disgusting. The eggplant was only barely cooked, meaning it wasn't at the right mushy texture. I had to stir fry it again for dinner in order for it to taste somewhat decent.  I used to come here for bubble tea, but ever since Fuku Tea opened down the street near Pitt campus I've basically avoided Rose Tea at all costs. Fuku Tea has the best bubble tea, and the service is much better. Also, they take credit cards with no minimums. Why risk raising your cortisol levels by going to Rose Tea at Craig when you can have better food and service somewhere else? A silly question, if you ask me.",
