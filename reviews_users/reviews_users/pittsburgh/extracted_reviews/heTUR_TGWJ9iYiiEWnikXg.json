I ordered the cream of tomato with feta and basil with a grilled cheese with bacon. I was a little disappointed by how dilute the soup was, as usually a cream-based soup should be thicker. Nevertheless the grilled cheese hit the spot.",

I came here twice during a quick trip to PGH, once for dinner and once for lunch.  For dinner I had the mushroom melt, recommended to me by the cashier, and got it to go.  Little did I know what gossip I may have missed by this decision!  I ate the sandwich in my hotel room while watching Friends reruns.  Not. The. Same.  (The sandwich, btw, was fantastic.  As was the pumpkin cookie I got with it.) The next day (a Sunday), I couldn't think of a lunch option I wanted more, so I returned, this time getting a \"fresh mozz baguette.\"  Saying \"mozz\" instead of mozzarella kind of weirds me out, but it's not them, it's me.  The sandwich was great.  This time I ate in, in the little room behind the ordering area.  This was both the best and worst decision I made while at Eat Unique.  Because I didn't know it at the time, but a nearby table had two hungover sorority girls, dishing about a party they'd gone to the night before.  I was both riveted and disgusted for the rest of my meal.  Recommended.",

Hearty and has a bit of a kick to it. Black bean burger is the bomb, minus the goopy cheese. The sweet bean hummus was a wonderful surprise on a recent sandwich I had.   Sometimes, I feel that it is a bit expensive for say a lunch meal but as the hubby. has pointed out, it us comparable in pricing to Panera, and much better.   The desserts are not the goopy kind full of thick icing or heavy cream. Instead, large Sea Salt and Choco Chip cookies, Pumpkin bars, Thick and just a bit dry (the way I like 'em) Shortbread cookies adorn the dessert case.  I like the adventure of going here. Trying new combos of ingredients is always a treat when you trust the culinary integrity of a place, like I do of Eat Unique",

The soup and sandwich combo feels like a good bang for your buck too. I'd recommend the hummus sandwich or California chicken or avocado chicken. The desserts are AMAZING, too.

Having lived in California most of my life, I value a vegetable-heavy meal, especially for the right price, and that can be more difficult to find in this otherwise lovely city.  So thank you Eat Unique, for consistently supplying me with a hearty, healthy option on a tight budget. Your fresh meal-sized salads for under $7? You are awesome. Your chicken chili with chard and corn in it for $4 and some change? OMG I love you.   If y'all want to talk about crappy sandwiches, go across the street for an overpriced bagel, or better yet, hit up Panera (ew). But if you want delicious fresh food, a big selection, and not feel robbed? I'd totally recommend this place.",

The food is fine, but everything else about the place is annoying. -Your half sandwich, half soup options are limited to the most boring sandwiches on the menu.  I understand that not all sandwiches halve well, but this seems like a cheap trick to force the customer to buy a whole sandwich when they only want a half with their soup.  If you read my other reviews, you'll note that this sort of upselling gimmick is a huge pet peeve of mine.   -The area in front of the register is always crowded with fidgety hungry people scrutinizing the four-digit numbers on their receipts and waiting for their food.  There's a second register behind all these people, but it's difficult to see and even more difficult to reach. -The decor is well-painted dinginess.  The demeanor of the staff waffles between deadpan and morose, probably because they're tired telling customers that they can't order the half sandwich they want with soup.  The water fountain is a weird little sink.  The tables wobble.   It's like they're not even trying to be a good restaurant and are thriving on the low standards of craig st diners (myself included).  I will praise their southwest sizzler, and turkey chili as very solid (and, dare I say, \"unique\") culinary offerings, but most of what I've had there has been boring and overpriced.",

All of their creations are very inventive and delicious. And at a very reasonable price considering the quality of food you're getting. A sandwich is about the same price as a Subway sandwich, but SO MUCH BETTER.  I recommend getting the half and half option (choose 2 from half sandwich, soup, salad). Their Tomato Basil and Feta soup is phenomenal. For sandwiches, I recommend the Southwest Sizzler (veg), Hummus (veg), Summer (veg), and the Tuna Melt.",

I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon so Eat Unique is great location wise and price wise.   I ordered the white chili and the chicken pesto sandwich with gouda.  Both were delicious but so filling, I should've ordered just one thing!  The chili is thick, but really yummy, a little spicy (but I have low tolerance for spicy).  Unfortunately, for both me and my friend, the woman who took our order messed up for the both of us when it came to the sizes of our chili orders.  I ended up taking my chili home, and it tastes just as yummy when microwaved a few hours later!  The chicken pesto sandwhich was absolutely wonderful.  I'm not big on vegetables or pesto that tastes what I call too \"green\", so this pesto was really good.  Not too raw tasting.  The chicken was really good and fresh.  I really liked the bread that the sandwich is made on, but not quite sure what the name of it is.  The only thing is that the pesto was a little oily, so the sandwich kept dripping as I ate and the chicken kept sliding around.    Overall, I am now a much bigger fan of Eat Unique!",

    "text": "In Pittsburgh we have no shortage of delicious, locally owned restaurants, as you can see from the loads of reviews posted here.  But, these are mostly sit-down with entrees and service, best for dinner.  When it comes to lunchtime, 'burghers are often at the mercy of national chains like Subway, Quizno's, McDonald's, Qdoba, Chipotle, etc.  Don't get me wrong, those chains have a place and a time (maybe), but I want more from my lunch.  Where's all the delis in this town anyway?  There's not enough!  Not enough, I tell you!  But I'm on the hunt, and for no particular reason, my first stop is Eat Unique.  It may not be fast, or particularly cheap, but their sandwiches are eponymously creative, and when they are good they are eminently satisfying.  The food here is by and large tasty.  They've got all the standard lunch fair: soups, salads, cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, coffee, tea, and bakery items.  These offerings are sometimes just straight up classics, like a Reuben or BLT, but often there is a slight twist.  So... tomato soup with feta.  Or a chicken sandwich, Hawaiian style.  Or a meatloaf melt with blue cheese and BBQ sauce.  This is the kind of place where you'll find golden raisins instead of regular, lots of different kinds of bread (toasted and grilled),  and spring greens, balsamic vinaigrette, pesto, and banana peppers as regular toppings.  Oh, and of course they have wraps.  In this century, everyone has to sell a wrap, lest they be mistaken for an old-person restaurant or someplace located in a state like Arkansas or Idaho.  (And even they have wraps now!  And smoothie huts!  The world, it is a changin'...)  So they get bonus points for their consistent attempts at sandwich originality.  I have to warn you, though, sometimes the sandwich does not quite pull together like you'd imagine.  For example, the day I noticed the Hawaiian style chicken sandwich I immediately had all sorts of hopes and dreams for how it would solve many of my lunch, life, and also the world's problems.  I thought, based on the description it must be the most amazing delightful sandwich in history. C'mon: Chicken salad topped with crushed pineapple, roasted red peppers, and shredded provolone cheese; baked in a sour dough sub roll, garnished with field greens and balsamic vinaigrette?  Sounds frickin' awesome, right?  Sadly, it just doesn't live up.  For me.  Especially for $7.  Something about the sourdough-provolone interaction, or the pineapple-balsamic combo...  But that's just me. Mostly you have to try a lot of different things to find what appeals to you here.  And you should definitely give it more than one chance because there are loads of really delicious things.  I lovvvve the fresh mozzerella baguette.  It reminds me of this Bread Salad stuff I make at home sometimes, and also is reminiscent of the best bruschetta of my life, at a dinky pizza place called Gigi's in Jensen Beach, FL, where ostensibly the owner has three balls, as in testicles (note: I have not personally verified the accuracy of this statement with my own two hands... yet).  But I digress, at Eat Unique, I also love that if I just want a little soup, I can get a cheap hunk of baguette to eat it with.  I also love that they have the most AMAZING herbal iced tea ever, only one available at a time, on rotation (currently a delicious Blood Orange, but it used to be the most amazing Peppermint).  And I love that they have Chocolate Chip and Sea Salt cookies.  People definitely do not appreciate this sweet and salty combination of flavors nearly enough.  You gotta dip your fries in your Frosty if you want to experience life!  So Eat Unique is going to stay put, for a while I am sure.  It doesn't always live up, but it does most of the time, and for that reason I will always be their customer.  Plus they have a really giant eating area now, which is much improved from the early years (though I wish they'd fix the ordering and pick-up area, which is annoyingly cramped and confusing for everyone involved).  Moreover, this place is excellent for vegetarians, who can find the same sandwich creativity extended towards all-veg fare.  If you are in Oakland on the CMU end of things, or are planning a trip to the Carnegie, and want an interesting and probably pretty good lunch in the 'deli'-ish category, you should definitely try this place.  It all around qualifies as good.  GET: Iced tea Fresh Mozz Baguette is my current pick Soups  UNDERWHELMING: Hawaiian Chicken Sub Sweet Bean Hummus Sandwich      (I was very sad about this; I really wanted this to be the best ever!!)  SNEAKY TIP: The lunch hours are ridiculously slow here, and to be honest, the non-lunch hours are still ridiculously slow.  If you are at all pressed for time, do NOT order something from the grill.  In fact you may be best off not 'ordering' anything at all and instead getting one of their pre-packed things to go, like a salad, or phoning in your order ahead of time, or going after 2pm.",

Usually because I just make my mind up that that's what it's going to be.  Totally solid reasoning, right!?  What I was excited about where the alternative food sub options.  I ordered a Taco Salad and instead of beef chili I ordered turkey chili.  That, in my head, was healthy.  In reality I don't think a heaping portion of gauc, sour cream and cheese added up to zero calories.  Let's also consider the fact that for a moment I thought I had ordered JUST a nacho platter because the ratio of nacho chips vs lettuce was about 20 chips to 1 piece of lettuce.  Don't get me wrong...it was really REALLY good...but it was a nacho platter.    And you know what...I am TOTALLY ok with that!  Eat Unique folks!",

Here's the other thing about Eat Unique: if you go during the lunchtime rush, they will take forever to finish your order, and then there's a good chance they will have gotten the order wrong.  The counter is a whirling nightmare of poorly designed space, with various customers milling around waiting to order, waiting for their order, or trying to figure out if the mysterious back register is open or not.  If you're here during the lunch rush, your only hope for not dying of starvation is ordering pre-made food: salads and soups.  If you order a grilled sandwich, you're completely screwed.  This is a shame because, as I said, the food is actually pretty good.  If they could turn an order around in less than 5 minutes, I'd eat here every day.  But until then, I can only take eating here about once a month.   I want lunch to lower my stress, not increase it.  On a positive note, they do have good breakfast sandwiches, and the place is usually not busy at breakfast, so you can grab a good bite to eat there in the mornings.",

    "text": "Unfortunately I think I've had it with Eat Unique. Being stuck in the restricted options of North Craig Street I've been a customer at Eat Unique a number of times. The food is fine, nothing special. A couple sandwiches are better than average, a couple worse. Overall it is overpriced for what you get.   But let's get to the real problem: this place is a terribly run restaurant. My experience today is rather typical. I go in and order at sandwich to carry out at about 2:30pm. So it's after the lunch rush and not extremely busy. And I wait for 14 minutes for my sandwich!! While I'm waiting I start to fume a bit as I make some observations. I count NINE employees currently working (and maybe more in the back I couldn't see). That's a heck of a lot of staff for a soup and sandwich shop with no table service that isn't even that busy.   But here's the real kicker: I counted SEVEN tickets while I was waiting. That means there were two more people working than there were orders, and it still took me 14 minutes to get a sandwich. There is something very wrong with that. Most of the problem was obvious, the majority of the staff seemed to be wandering around behind the counter not exactly sure what they were doing, not at a particular assigned station, and moving really quite slowly on whatever task they were attempting to figure out. It's sandwiches, not haute cuisine. It should be fast, efficient, and good. And just because the staff looked mostly like college kids and 20 somethings is no excuse. The campus pub I used to work at was all 19year olds in the kitchen and with a little training, three of them could crank out solid food at about five times the rate of Eat Unique with a much more complex menu including a flattop and fryer.   My suggestion to the owners/managers: fire half your staff (which should allow you to lower your prices), and get 3-4 solid line cooks that know what they're doing and how to work in a kitchen. I guarantee your business will improve when people don't have to wait 20min for a sandwich and a cup of soup.",

Also, in the summer they have peppermint iced tea, which is delicious.   My only problem is their space set up- there are very few tables and if you go at lunch, the entire place is packed with people either waiting in line to order or just standing around waiting for their food.

    "text": "The chilly, rainy weather today put me in the mood for some nice hot homemade soup. However, it also deterred me from going to the Strip to get it, so I decided to head down the street instead to Eat Unique.  I must admit that after having picked up an unimpressive sandwich (don't remember which) from here a couple of years ago before a trip, I'd been hesitant to patronize this place again.  Having reviewed other Yelpers' comments, I decided to opt for a small tomato basil feta soup and the pesto chicken sandwich, which came to slightly over $10 together.  Because I went today (Sat.), it wasn't very busy, and I didn't encounter any confusion or hostility when ordering.  After ordering, my food took about 5 min. to prepare. Since I live nearby, I took it back to my apt. to consume.  The tomato soup, which was reasonably warm, although not quite as hot as I'd like it, was pretty good, albeit not mind-blowing.  The sandwich was solidly okay, and not as flavorful as I would have liked, esp. for something containing pesto.  Although it stayed together fairly well, the ingredients slid around a fair bit, and it cooled off pretty quickly, to the point that I put the second half in the microwave before eating it.  While the food was solidly okay, esp. for deli food in PGH, I've had better.  I prefer to patronize independent local businesses over chains, but I'd say the food is a step up from Subway, but doesn't quite meet the standard of the food at Panera.",

    "text": "Very hit or miss busy lunchtime place. Sort of overpriced but since it's the only place of it's kind within a 6 block radius I'd say there isn't much incentive for them to lower their prices.   The wait times can be extremely long so call ahead for your order if you can. The line can also get out of hand because folks don't properly know how to queue once they've placed their order. Be sure to go to the back counter and ask for a soup sample before buying--they say they make their soups daily but I've definitely had an old batch or two of chili that was clearly a few days old. When it's fresh, it's great. But when it's not it's the absolute worst.  I'd be more inclined to give this place another star if everything was simply $1 cheaper, but since I work nearby I'm sure I'll be back for another $12 lunch soon.",

    "text": "My only regret about this place is that I never came here when I was a student. It was so good!  Yes, the check-out space wasn't designed very well and often results in human traffic jams. Yes, the food costs more than you'd want it to here. But c'mon: EVERY place costs more than I want it to, and as someone else pointed out: Eat Unique's prices compare to Panera's, only Eat Unique's food tastes even better (and I say this as a solid Panera fan). There's a ton of seating options in here, too, so before you complain, just think about how many fewer tables there may have been if they knocked out a wall to try and expand the line area.  I had the Grilled Pesto Chicken sandwich during my first visit in an effort to avoid some of the \"unhealthier\" options on the menu and have to say, I was very, very pleased. It's very rare that I get a sandwich that perfectly balances toppings and meat; usually I get too much of one or the other. Plus, the toppings were crisp and fresh, and the chicken well cooked. Not the juiciest chicken ever but not dry by any means. It was right on, it hit the spot, and it left me feeling satisfied and yet ready for more.   Don't worry: I was good and opted to keep the place in mind for another day, rather than pig out on a second sandwich. I am already excited to come back and try many, many more options on the menu, including the veggie and the beef and brie sandwiches. I may eventually get to the soup and salad options, but those sandwiches, man...they're calling to me!",

It's rare to go to a sandwich shop and find gluten free bread. That being said, I was charged an extra $1.50 to have the gluten free bread. The extra fee is not what I'm upset about; I am use to being charged to have a gluten free substitute. What stunned me was the portion size. As you can see in the picture, the \"small soup\" I ordered is BIGGER than my sandwich. Inside my sandwich included ONE slice of tomato,ONE slice of Mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 of a cup of lettuce. If I am going to be charged extra for gluten free, make the inside of the sandwich the equivalent of a regular sandwich. COMPLETE RIPOFF. Had I not ordered the small cup of soup I would have left hungry. If you are going to EatUnique for gluten free options, don't. Buying the ingredients at the store would not only be cheaper but more filling than coming here.",

There is also some limited  outdoor sitting for the summer time.    My absolute favorite is the summer sandwich, while I highly recommend the tuna salad as well.  However, whatever I have tried is very good, so I do not think you can really go wrong with any option.

The standard soups are pretty decent; I like the tomato feta, and the white turkey chili is great if you like turkey and beans.  I have tried some \"special\" soups of the day that really missed the spot.  Fortunately, they can give you samples of soup before you choose to order it -- don't be shy to ask for them!  Their salads are reasonable -- the greens mix is fresh, and the meat is fine.  I've also tried the pesto chicken sandwich, which I like (although the chicken isn't the best quality), the italian veggie wrap, which I found to be way too oily and heavy, and the BLTTA, which I did not like.  The \"avocado\" part of the BLTTA is some kind of soft guacamole-like paste clearly squeezed from a tube.  Don't expect fresh slices from an actual avocado!  Their desserts always look super appealing, but I always regret them once I get them.  They are super heavy...TOO heavy -- either saturated with butter, or sugar, or both -- I often feel sick after eating a whole one!  They are also not cheap!  All in all, I would expect the quality of the food here to be better for the prices they are charging (you'll easily have a $10 lunch here).  If you want to give it a try, the best bargain is to get soup.  Oh yeah, and the other reviews are right about the shitty checkout-line space!",

    "text": "This place is great if you're looking for a delicious lunch and are not short on time. Their soups are all pretty solid choices; I highly recommend either the tomato feta basil or chicken florentine! I normally get the half-sandwich/half-soup combo, but their sandwich options for the combo are pretty limited. Their chicken pesto sandwich is decent, but it can get pricey especially if you get it with a soup.  The biggest downside I can think of is the inconsistency in wait time. Depending on how many people ordered and how many people called in, the wait can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. The layout of the place is also a bit weird; you can't really hear the number of your order from the tables, so many people crowd by the counter where food comes out, which is right next to the cashier. As a result, it gets super crowded around an already small area. Everything's great once you get your food, but the ordering and waiting process can definitely be refined.",

One day I forgot to pack my lunch so I wandered down to Craig and Forbes.  I wait for the bus by Eat Unique so I figured I would test it out.  I ordered a spicy grilled cheese ($5.99 w tax).  I think it had pepper jack and cheddar cheese, tomato, and banana peppers.  There was supposed to be bacon, but it was either a negligible amount or they forgot it.  Maybe I was starving, but this sandwich was great.  I really loved the combination and the price is so fair.  Panera charges twice that for some of their sandwiches.  This place gets crazy at lunch time.  I think I waited about ten minutes, which is ok.  If I ever forget my lunch again, I'll be back!",

    "text": "I'm not trying to knock this place in any way, but I was not impressed at all.  First off, I did not dine in here, I called in an order and stopped to pick it up.  The space itself is unique, very colorful, and definitely not like any other place I have been in the city.    The order I called in was a rather larger order so I expected that there would be a little wait.  When I showed up on Craig St. I was surprised to find a nearby street parking space and not have to circle several times.  But that did not matter, my order still wasn't even started by the time that I was quoted the order to be ready.  Then add into that the fact that when I called in the order and by the time they started to prepare the order, the soup of the day was out.  So instead of setting aside the soup for our order, they sold it to someone that ordered after us.    To say the girl that was running the register was frazzled is an understatement.  She literally was running around.  I think that she was new or inexperienced, and that was unsettling.  Especially when she went to make a cappuccino and didn't know how to steam the milk or how to pour the milk into the espresso.  Then when it came to getting the orders comprised and ready to go, my order was split between another lady's order.  Even though I was being rushed to leave and make space at the counter I'm glad I looked at my order before I left.  Why?  Because it still wasn't correct.  Anyway, enough with that, let's talk about the food.  I ordered the Spicy Grilled Cheese and Bacon with a small bowl of Cream of Tomato with Feta and Basil.  The grilled cheese was definitely the star of the day.  The soup on the other hand was extremely salty and I could not finish it.    To sum it up, This place really did make eating unique, and not in a good way.",

I ordered more food then I normally would have because so many people complained about small portions. I ordered a taco salad with white turkey chili on top, tomato basil soup, vegetarian pineapple burger on a regular bun (not gluten free) , and a chocolate chip cookie. This was enough food for 2 or 3 people. I was full after the salad but managed to eat half of the burger and half of the cookie. It was absolutely delicious. I did not taste the soup yet. The salad had guacamole, cheese, tortilla chips, sour cream, lettuce, and the homeade white turkey chili. Yum! The burger was big and very tastey with sweet and savory. The cookie was warm, soft, and had tons of chocolate chips in it. I would say it is a little overpriced for lunch even if I ordered just enough for 1 person. I would definitely recommend this place!",

I sometimes love it and other times they don't get it right. I like the soup (cold Pittsburgh winters). I also love the cookie selection. I can never finish a cookie since it is really big, but I get one if I feel like treating myself - my favorite being the sea-salt cookie. You can also get great coffee.

Full disclosure, I've worked within blocks from Eat Unique, which I still call Craig Street Coffee, for years.  Is the food good?  Yes.  Is the service good?  Meh. Is it insanely chaotic during lunch?  A resounding YES.   The food here is vegan friendly for sure. Lots of homemade soups and delicious sandwiches to choose from.  I'm fairly certain their soup is made from scratch daily.   I can't give Eat Unique five stars because every time I go there for lunch I'm under extreme duress. This is due to the two register chaos, lack of room to wait for your order, and the amount of time you have to wait for a sandwich.  But it's good food and a good pick if you're wondering aimlessly on Craig Street, as I often am.",

Everyone else seemed as though they liked it more than I did, and I resented the frequency with which people would suggest it for lunch. (Actually it's totally possible that other people's love for it fueled my resentment. \"It's ok,\" I'd say, resignedly, anytime it was suggested. \"The sandwiches are quite small,\" I'd thrown in, pointedly.)  But towards the end of my time there, I found myself craving the various delicious soups and going there on *gasp* my own. The white turkey chili, the Italian wedding, the lemon chicken rice... mmm, soothing and savory.  Especially in comparison to the other Craig St. options, Eat Unique is a fantastic, generally healthy lunch option, and I must admit that I miss it dearly.",

The only thing that sort of bothered me was the fact that the service didn't seem to even know what was on the menu or what I was ordering when I asked questions. At first, I thought it was just my order, but someone else came in right after me and asked some questions and also got the same blank stare and \"I don't know\" response.   I got a grilled veggie wrap and it was decent. A little greasy (but I was expecting that from a deli style place like this) but it was satisfying enough to make a dinner out of.  It looked like their baked goods were pretty popular (saw a few vegan things which was nice!) but I didn't get the chance to try any.   Like I said, for a college town, this is a pretty great place to eat. I'd also imagine it was a really nice place to study as well. I was in Pittsburgh on a business trip when I went here and it was quiet enough to relax and not be bothered, which I do appreciate.",

Their burgers are awesome - Zesty pineapple and Chipotle black bean burger are awesome, but expensive. You can make these burgers yourself, as the patties are commercially available in costco/trader joes. Tex Mex Taco salad is my fav among the salads - enough protein and everything! I'm not a big fan of cold sandwiches, so I can't tell. Although, I would say, their very veggie sandwiches are balanced and have a lot of protein. I love that they have half sandwich/half soup option, but I really don't feel like eating sandwiches all the time. Mushroom melt is another one of fav! Their daily special herbal ice teas are great! I have them during summer and they are very refreshing.  Overall, if you don't mind the expense, it is a great place for seasonal lunch or desserts!",

For example, it said it came with avocado which I assumed would be slices of fresh avocado, but instead it was a guacamole that was not fresh made with no chunks in it.  The chicken was nice those--it was warm and I think fresh grilled.  It did take awhile to come out and came in a tiny box that it was crammed into so it made it really hard for me to the dressing and toppings together when I was eating it.  They also appear to have a really nice section of loose leaf teas and coffee.  I'm not sure why it's called Eat Unique since except for maybe a couple of options the food doesn't seem all that unique to me.  Mostly typical sandwiches, salads, and soups.  I think it's a little pricey for what you get and the servers weren't that friendly.",

My hummus sandwich, on the other hand, may have been the worst hummus I've had in recent memory. Just as I never understand why Pad See Ew is sugary sweet in some Thai restaurants,  I will never understand why the hummus at Eat Unique tasted like it was full of sugar instead of tahini. I have a sweet tooth the size of Canada, but hummus should never be as sweet as it was at Eat Unique.",

    "text": "Oakland is full of lunch places, but if you are looking for something light, healthy, and fresh, you're pretty much out of luck....except for Eat Unique!  I had lunch here earlier today, and was so excited to see a menu of sandwiches and salads that didn't contain french fries....  The atmosphere is minimalist.  There are some bright colors, but it's mostly just cafeteria-style tables and chairs, no decoration.  You order at the counter, then wait awhile - about 15 minutes in our case - for your lunch.  My boyfriend got the meatloaf melt, and I ordered the grilled chicken pesto sandwich.  It was hard to wait so long, but as soon as we got our sandwiches it was obvious why we had been left hanging - the food was FRESH.  My sandwich was hot, the chicken fresh off the grill, the tomatoes sweet and flavorful, the pesto made in-house (you can see the rustic bits of pine nuts and basil, definitely not the jarred stuff), the ciabatta roll lightly toasted and crispy.  I was really impressed from the first bite.  There's nothing really unique about the sandwich, except that it is made with high-quality ingredients and hasn't been sitting in a case all day, but that made a huge difference!  I tried my boyfriend's meatloaf sandwich, which wasn't as big as I thought it would be, and I liked it okay...the sauce was pretty sweet.  I preferred mine - it tasted so garden fresh.  For dessert we had a black bean brownie - yes, really - and it was great!  Who knew?  It just tastes like a creamy, chocolatey brownie.  You can put black beans in dessert!?  This changes everything.  Definitely craveworthy.  The only thing I'm not crazy about is the ambiance.  Since you have to wait so long, it'd be nice if the dining area was more comfortable or better maintained.  There was lots of water on the floor and I almost slipped a few times, we had to wipe down our own table....not a huge deal, but we noticed.  There are lots of big, sunny windows, so that's a plus.  I was also disappointed in the small Styrofoam cups for water - I hate drinking out of Styrofoam, it feels so wasteful (and the cups are so small you have to go back a million times to refill).  But I'd definitely come back - maybe for takeout next time - if I was very tasty and unlike anything else you can get in the area.",

And it went perfectly with crisp ice tea. The portions are a good size (some might argue its a bit on the small size).  Its fairly crowded during lunchtime though. And because of this, service can be very very slow. I've waited for 30-40 min once for a sandwich. I know I'm not the only one because another customer at the time had to leave before she could get her sandwich. We got refunds though. I think they might be understaffed during lunch hours.  Their iced coffee is very nice. It's deep, rich, and nutty. I might put a little cream in, but its pretty tasty on its own.",

It does get a tad crowded during lunch hour, but the service has been quick. One time they forgot to give me one the sandwiches I ordered, I came back and they were very nice and apologetic and gave us a free cookie! I love having this place right down the street",

Pesto, Italian cold cuts, roasted red peppers, arugula, balsamic, cheese, all toasted into a delicious omgasm.  + The chilis and soups looked delicious although I did not get a chance to try them. + I'm not typically a soy chai kind of guy, but after trying a sip of one from Eat Unique, I may be a convert. Don't tell anyone.  - It took a while for order (maybe 10 minutes), but it was made to order and fresh. - Hectic line and ordering situation. Perhaps they should move the rear register next to front one to avoid confusion amongst customers and having to tell every other customer that there is a second secret register.",

Maybe I should have opted for one of the oven-roasted but the regular sandwiches were overpriced.   The tomato bisque was good and would be the only reason I would ever return.   The service was ... less than helpful. It's okay if you don't know the answer but it'd be nice if they asked someone else instead of disregarding my question and giving me something I told them I didn't want.   Also, if you're vegan the options are really limited (to essentially soup or chili). I was expecting a lot more variety since the logo and name imply a healthier alternative, but like everything else it was a disappointment.   The price is equivalent to panera (which is overpriced) but the quality and service do not make up for such high prices. Looks like I'll be sticking to Panera or even subway. At least subway charges a decent price and actually offers more flavor.",

The time between ordering the food and it being in your mouth is a little slow... I'd say if I were here on my lunch break, I'd be a bit miffed that I lost most of it.  The portions aren't really that big, but for city prices they're about in line with the cost.  Food quality is about a hair better than Panera, in my experience.  I've had the southwest somethingorother there, as well as a roast beef and brie baguette.  They were both satisfying, and the roast beef and brie was pretty excellent, especially with the brie being all melty.  The service may be slow, but it's also friendly, so that's a plus.",

During Lent, they serve the most amazing mac and cheese on Fridays (make sure to get sriracha with it). Great selection of tea and very reasonably priced. Would recommend to anyone!",

    "text": "I am so unclear why Eat Unique doesn't have a better average rating because this place has always blown my palate away.  You can tell the ingredients are fresh; the combinations are clever and full of flavor; and I haven't ordered anything that wasn't extremely delicious (or soggy).  I think this place blows Panera away in terms of variety, taste, and price.  The wedding soup is especially amazing - it never needs cheese, salt, and/or pepper.   And I have to say - if you're complaining about WAITING 15 minutes for a sandwich that does have MEAT on it, then GO TO MICKEY D'S!  It blows my mind that people get mad at waiting for FRESH FOOD!  Guess what?  FRESH FOOD takes longer than 30 seconds to zap in a microwave!   If you want your radon with that sandwich, again, you can go find that crap on any corner.  It is called \"Eat Unique\"; not \"Eat Like All The Other Corporate Franchises.\"  If you want your 5-minute wait for a foot long - you don't need me to tell you where to go. That being said, the grilled chicken pesto sandwich is my #1 favorite and order it most often (pesto - the blending of basil, pine nuts, and garlic; if you want your mayo, again go somewhere else).  But their veggie sandwich or wrap is also heaven. The only gripe I have is that it's on Craig St right in between Forbes and Fifth; which makes it very difficult to find parking if you're ordering to go.  But I can only knock a star off for that because the food is too good....I'll drive around the block a few times if I have to!   If you're a real foodie, and you're in Oakland, pass up LuLus noodles and go across the street to Eat Unique for real food.",

    "text": "Eat Unique has a great menu full of unique sandwiches and salads that leaves Panera in the dust. I finally made it out to the cafe for lunch today and had an overall good experience.  The only negative part of my lunch was that my girlfriend asked for American cheese on her sandwich rather than the normal bleu cheese. They ended up giving her a corner of a piece of American as well as bleu cheese. It's a shame that they couldn't get such a simple request right, especially since we arrived at 1:30 and the lunch crowd was gone. I also ordered a pecan bar and did not receive it, I went back to the cashier and she gave me one. Reading similar negative comments regarding accuracy with ordering makes me think it's something they should work on.  The food was excellent, however. I got the Italian sub and it was full of fresh spring greens rather than the usual shredded ice berg lettuce. I also tried their white turkey chili and it was excellent as well. My girlfriend managed to pick most of the bleu cheese off of her meatloaf melt and said it was really good. She also had the tomato feta and basil soup and enjoyed it.  The pecan bar was a flaky crust, a kind of dense chocolate ganache and a pecan topping similar to a pecan pie. It was really good. The food at Eat Unique seems to be fresh and in plentiful portions. We'd definitely go back. I hope they get their ordering accuracy in better shape, though.",

My boyfriend and I split the BLTTA wrap (Bacon, Lettuce, Turkey, Tomato, Avocado wrapped in a sun dried tomato tortilla) and it was DELICIOUS.  I don't think I can think of a bad thing to say about it, everything tasted super fresh, the avocado was almost more like guacamole and the contrast between that and the crispy texture of the bacon was amazing.    We also got the Berry Salad, which was walnuts, goat cheese, thinly sliced strawberries and grilled chicken over mixed greens.  It came with Balsamic vinaigrette, but between the creaminess of the goat cheese and the strawberries you almost didn't need any dressing at all.  Between that and splitting the sandwich it was the perfect amount of food.  Highly recommended -- I wish I lived in Pittsburgh so I could eat here more often!",

The Parking Gods were on my side today as they parted the parallel parking sea for me.   I heard they had good sandwiches, but I thought there was a waiter service.  Its more of a deli counter style where they call your number when its ready.  Nothing fancy.  And WoW does one of the girls have some strong vocal cords. Good for a quick lunch break or dinner before your class.  Prices were reasonable.  I had the Meatloaf sandwich.  Great for a chilly day.  The sauce, blue cheese, and bacon on top definitely set it off.  I'm going to be craving this bad boy for a while.  My BF had the Tuna Melt.  It was very good as well, but you better be a fan of banana peppers.  If you are like me, and usually drink water over soda pop, the free water you have to get yourself.  I did not know this.....so I was standing there waiting until I was pointed to the self serve area with tiny styro cups and tiny sink for tap water.  No ice. I understand the water is free, so I'm not asking for much.  But when you are eating a heavily seasoned Meatloaf Sandwich......you are going to be thirsty enough to put down 4-5 of those cups.  So either A. Come prepared with your own cup, B. Spring for a $ bottle of water, or C. get some exercise getting up and down to get water and work off your Meatloaf Sandwich.",

I got their \"special\" blood orange tea\" and a \"spicy gourmet grilled cheese\". First of  all the tea tasted like nothing like oranges or tea more like flavored water. The sandwich oh dear. So on the menu is says it comes on sourdough bread with bacon, tomato, banana  peppers and pepperjack cheese. THAT is not all what I received! My sandwich came out on a piece of tin foil fsoaked in grease. It was not made on sourdough, it has no pepperjack, no tomatos. NOTHING about it was gourmet. Literally just some white bread with some form of greasy yellow cheese and some uncooked bacon. The seating was just like a fast food restuarant, DIRTY WALLS, DIRTY (LOOKING) EMPLOYEES. Being completely grossed out I opened my sandwich to pick the disgusting bacon and guess what I found?!! You guessed it  HAIR. YES THERE WAS A BIG PIECE OF BLACK HAIR IN MY FOOD. MIND YOU my meal cost over twelve dolars for a small sandwich and tea. I told the cashier she didn't even apoligize or seem surprised when I handed the sandwich to her. IF I wouldn't have opened my sandwich I would have eaten hair.  I'M DISGUSTED. This place is GARBAGE.",

I had a Cobb Salad and a pumpkin bar/muffin thing. The pumpkin sweet? Awesome. I want to know how to make it myself.  The Cobb salad was ok--lots of cheddar cheese, tasty shredded chicken, nice well-done bacon, and a hardboiled egg. All that was good. The guacamole was not fresh (tasted like the premade grocery store crap), which is a disappointment considering that guacamole is probably the easiest dish on the planet to make (avocado, salt, and a fork...where can it go wrong). I was left wanting a piece of bread with my salad.  I also didn't like the plastic container it was served in. Those things activate my feelings of enviro-guilt. I would have preferred a ceramic or even paper plate and some metal utensils. However, the air conditioning was very welcome on a hot day so I'll forgive them for plastic.  I will probably return for more pumpkin goodies, but I doubt the sandwiches and salads will bring me back.",
