The other staff was also wonderful.   Purchased a fresh loaf of bread to go! Yum.  We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I was stopped at the door before entering when reading the posted menu, I saw the prices for a 16\" pizza.  Ranging from $19 to $24, this is way out of what I expected.  I am all in favor for pizza made from dough prepared 24 hours in advance (as real Neapolitan pizza is), but at most I would expect a price range of $14 to $16.  The most expensive pizza in Italy is at around 11 Euro.  Or with the latest trends of fancy flours made of non-wheat (chickpea, chestnut..), other \"concept\" experimental foccaccia-like creations are getting some high-paying interest.  But for thick-dough pan-dish-looking oven-cooked dough with stuff on top,  why should Pittsburgh have it priced at twice that amount? maybe it is the concept that is not working with my expectations.  If it something else that is not a pizza and is more of a full-fledged dinner entree, then I would agree at those prices.  But my mind right now is expecting an oven-baked flat-dish dough with stuff on top, aka \"pizza\".  It shouldn't be that expensive.  World-wide-view perception (except at 3600 block of Butler in Lawrenceville).",

The ambiance is cute, quaint and is a solid choice if you're willing to pay a lot for pizza.",

When we first walked in we were greeted by the host, who gave us a run down of the menu and drinks. We ordered 2 pizzas for 4 people, and some drinks. We got a number and sat down at table. Our host said the pizzas would be out in 13 minutes, but the pizzas didn't show up for about 25 minutes. We got the pepperoni pizza and a white pizza with mushrooms. The pizza was very good, but nothing crazy. I think this place is way overpriced, the cheapest pizza is about $19. I think Piccolo forno down the street has better pizza and at a better price. Cool place, but I don't think I'll go back.",

They let us choose our menu of three pizzas from a variety of options based on what was in season. The price was EXCELLENT compared to other catering options and way tastier, plus less stuffy and more appropriate for an outdoor, somewhat casual summer wedding. The guys pumped out 75 pizzas for our guests over the course of 2.5 or 3 hours (i don't remember the details exactly), and everyone loved them. We originally planned for each guest to get their own pizza, but everyone just shared in order to get a taste of each different pizza.  We also subscribed to their summer breadshare which I would recommend to anyone and will be subscribing once they start that up again.    Plus, Justin and Neil are two of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.",

If the pizza was $18 instead of $26 this would probably be a 4 star review, but between the crust issue and the price, definitely 3 star.

We don't usually frequent food trucks much but my bf and I have gone out of our way to visit Roundabout Brewery on Sundays just for this pizza! Now I'm in the habit of tracking where they go to make sure we can get our fix.   We've had multiple kinds of their pizza and also bought a loaf of bread and it's all fantastic. The wood-fired oven crisps up the pizza crust perfectly and they always have a small but good selection of pizza creations they've come up with. The pizzas are sized for one person if you're looking for a meal so we usually try two kinds and share so we can try variety.    The guys running the truck are super friendly as well which just adds to the appeal! Keep up the good work (-:",

My husband and I split a margarita pizza and weren't disappointed. We were impressed with how fresh everything tasted. The sauce was super flavorful and there was plenty of fresh cheese. The crust managed to be a perfect balance of crispy and soft, although parts of it were overly blackened, which wasn't to our liking (not a huge deal though). My other complaint was that the basil was also a bit charred and there wasn't enough of it (and it's my favorite part of a margarita pizza!) So that was a bit disappointing. But overall, it was a tasty pie. It was a bit pricey at $10, but it's big enough to split with someone for lunch or a light dinner (bigger appetites, however, could probably finish one solo). I'd certainly order from them again next time I come across this truck.",

The Archer with spicy sausage & multiple melty cheeses was a total winner. It's a pizza I'd order repeatedly. The Bricktop with braised pork and broccolini was a great choice as a 2nd shareable option. I was impressed that the broccolini still had a nice crispy snap after the oven.   It's tough to stand out with so many pizza options but they definitely do! I see by their schedule that they're often parked outside some of Pittsburgh's wonderful breweries.

I will definitely be back to try their other pizzas though.  Driftwood oven is a cute little restaurant with a nice family vibe. My fiancee and I discovered it while looking for an alternative to our usual pizza go to (which was closed for remodeling).  The place itself was really nice. They offered communal seating, which you will either love or hate. Personally, I like it. I figure it decreases the wait time, and you never know who you'll meet sitting next too you. I loved the overall decor, from the bench style seats and empty tomato sauce can as a pizza stand, you the mural of Pittsburgh depicted as a slice of pizza. The service was also great. The staff were attentive without being overbearing, and we didn't not wait long at all for our order to be taken.   Despite the pleasant atmosphere, the pizza we ordered did not live up to our expectations. We ordered the Bianca with fungi, which looked phenomenal from photos online. Sadly, when it got to our table there were hardly any mushrooms. There was also too much ricotta cheese which lacked flavor, and the chili flavor just added a touch of heart to each bite with out any real enhancement to the flavor profile. With so much ricotta, nothing held up the crust.  would pick a slice up, half of the toppings would slide off, leaving biting but the pizza dough that was too thin and soggy.   Despite this, the crust was delicious! Using sourdough was an unique twist, and I greatly enjoy it.  Despite my not being pleased with my pizza choice, I will be back to Driftwood. It is unfair to base an entire critique of a restaurant based on just one of their menu items.",

We ordered the Baba Ganoush appetizer and popcorn for the kids as we waited for all to arrive. As is usual with dips, we needed more bread in order to finish all of Baba Ganoush, so we asked for more bread, unaware until we received the bill that that additional bread was $3. The dip itself was $10. The small bowl of popcorn was $2. I think if you are spending $23 to $25 on a pizza that nickel and diming for the appetizers is unnecessary. We ordered three pizzas for dinner for the five adults. The Archer was our favorite. I thought the food and atmosphere at Driftwood was good but certainly not worth the $140 that we ended up paying for pizza and two appetizers. Alright, there were a couple of beers in there too! I do appreciate that they served locally brewed beers and cider!",

They have a TON of local beers which was awesome to try, and just hang out while we waited for our food. We went before a penguins game, and it wasn't too packed but sat at the bar area. Definitely worth trying. The dough of the pizza is the best, definitely worth the price. We will be coming back for sure!",

Imagine my disappointment when what we got was more like very greasy, very thick cardboard with very little flavor.  We ordered two different kinds of pizza - the \"red top\" and the margarita. They tasted almost exactly the same. They were both covered in puddles of oil. The crust was thick and hard throughout, making eating more like work than a reward.  If you want to compete in the awesome pizza category at this price point in this neighborhood, you've simply got to do better. I can't see any reason I would ever return here with Piccolo right up the block.",

The host (I think one of the owners) was extremely friendly and welcoming and explained the menu when we asked. Pizza is never really something I crave, but this place has certainly changed that. Excellent sourdough crust and toppings, a perfect blend of ingredients. We ordered one red pizza with sausage and added hot peppers and one white funghi pizza, and they were both amazing.

When eating the product of any restaurant, it's clear from the beginning when someone is completely devoted to, and passionate about, their craft. Driftwood is the rule.   The sourdough crust is a showstopper. It has an incredible chewy texture, crispy (not crunchy) exterior and just the best flavor. Even when I eat at some of the best pie places in Brooklyn I find myself wishing the crust was sourdough now!  The toppings / combinations are streamlined and smart. No need to customize - just trust them. The ingredients are high quality and locally sourced.   Though we'll miss these guys pulling their oven around to some of the best local breweries, we couldn't be happier to have them as a permanent fixture in the neighborhood. Here's to many successful years!",

Although the pizza is beyond visually appealing, it definitely lacks flavor. I ordered the vegan potato slice and it was beautiful, but tasted like a piece of bread w pieces of potato on it, slathered in oil. The white pizza we ordered was also very visually appealing, but lacked flavor - and left a lemon after taste. I have the same critique for everything else we ordered as well - baba ganoush, salad, popcorn, veggie pizza, and another pie (i forget the name)....all very tasteless but pretty to look at. The cider beer was actually 10/10 though so that's a plus. I would not recommend this restaurant to be honest, it's very over priced for the food you receive. I recommend this place to anyone that just wants to take a pic of a nice looking piece of pizza lol. Def wish we didn't blow $132 here",

Excellent crisp crust on the outside, not too charred, but chewy and tasty on the inside.  The Bricktop came with braised pork (yes please!) and broccolini.  Because I am the epitome of health, I considered having Broccolini on my pizza a serving of vegetables.  Both pizzas were quite good with the Archer getting my #1 vote.

We were kind of taken care of by everyone on the floor which was nice because everyone was attentive and it felt like we got to know everyone.   There is beer and wine, including wine on tap!  Ordered the bagaghanoush (deliciousssssss! Loved the pickled red onion on top) and two pizzas. Let's put it this way: I have leftovers, it's 9am and I'm about to go eat them.   I also love the Pittsburgh vibe, from the wall mural to the Pirates hat on one of the (I believe?) chefs. It's like home inside and I adore that.",

Not a problem, we're hungry, let's not get hangry.  We looked over the drafts list and saw some delightful beers on tap and in cans. Draft is way better and Driftwood has more local options on tap than cans. Hubs get a Flock and I get a How's Business? Sour, which is very sour.   We ordered the from the daily special and got the spigariello and sausage. The ingredients were tasty and offered a good spice and garlic flavor. What makes the pizza is the sourdough flavor. It's good, but not to the level of Slivers or Cheese Board (but then again the climate in the Bay Area makes sourdough more pronounced). It's still very good and the thin style is perfect.  There is only a 16 inch option, so come with someone. The couple next to us didn't know how much to order and wanted to try different pizzas and ended up ordering two. It was quite a bit of pizza. One pie had eight slices. Frame of reference, I had two slices, Hubs was hungry and had four.   The cookies compelled us, so we wrapped up the evening each with a chocolate sea salt cookie. Pretty tasty, but it was in a fridge. My guess is that they stored it there so it wouldn't melt on a hot day. Fine, a bit disappointing.  Service was friendly, but there was only one wait person and it was crowded for the first 30-45 minutes we were there. As such, it was a bit of a wait.",

Service was fantastic. Food was fantastic. It's one of those places where you walk in to a packed house - and you just know it's going to be something special.   10/10.

After fully understanding the situation, Justin sought to make amends and make up for our experience. His kindness, ownership of the situation, and True sincerity was impressive. This positive experience definitely put Driftwood back on the 'good restaurant list' from handling a bad experience with the appropriate kindness and apologetic attitude; I do think they want to learn from mistakes and be the best restaurant they can be.",

We went right as they opened and tables were filling up quick! For a salad (that we split), a  16\" pizza and 3 drinks- our total was under $60. I'll definitely make a point to go back!",

After a day of beer sampling, we were getting hungry and decided to look at their menu.   My husband loves pizza.  I on the other hand am usually unimpressed with most places. Actually, I would usually opt to eat well just about anything else besides pizza.  However, the smell from the makeshift kitchen was enticing and we were in need of some grub.    We decided on the Archer pie.  The best part about this pie was how well they cooked the fresh crust.  It had a perfect texture.  Not doughy and not too charred.  The ingredients were all very fresh and the sauce was quite delicious.   The size is more in line of a personal pizza, but one can share for a light dinner or appetizer.  Great beer with great food is a win win in my book.",

The two guys that run this spot are just so incredibly friendly, especially Justin. They truly care about their customers and want to be sure you have the best dining experience. Their pies are very big and definitely enough for two people to share. Tried the mushroom soup the other week, wow was that so incredibly delicious and packed with SO much flavor. So hearty and unique, definitely give it a try. For a vegan pie I love just doing a simple marinara with shiitake mushrooms, but last time Justin recommended the customer vegan pie the kitchen was whipping up. Toppings included caramelized onions, butternut squash, charred kale, shiitake mushrooms, and black radish, all over their house marinara - wowow, it looked so beautiful, almost too pretty to eat. They also have a great wine and local beer selection. Apps, salads, and sandwiches. Love the red checkered table cloths and the cheese mural of downtown Pittsburgh on the back wall is so epic. We are lucky this duo found a brick and mortar, looking forward to my next time back.",

Driftwood is a godsend!   The sourdough crust is amazing. The toppings taste fresh and seem thoughtfully paired. After a few visits, I've tried about 5 pizzas, all of which were good, but nothing has rivaled The Archer.   The baba ganoush appetizer is excellent. Pro tip: Save any extra you may have for dipping your pizza crust.  The service is awesome. Our waitress was very attentive and the rest of the staff was friendly and good humored.  Reservations aren't currently accepted, but you can put your name on the list and have a drink in the waiting area or a bar nearby (though there's no system to alert you that your table is ready). We had a large party (8) during peak on Friday night and only had to wait ~40 min. It was well worth it.",

I'll start by saying make a reservation or be prepared to wait. It's very small inside and they require your whole party to be present in order to be seated. They did serve us drinks while we waited though which was greatly appreciated.   After a half hour wait, we sat down and quickly ordered the pizza rolls and two pizzas. We ordered the Bianca and one with spicy Italian sausage. I can't say enough about how good they were! The crust is extra thin, the flavor packs through every bite. It was too good to even remember to snap a pic!  If you're in Lawrenceville, I can't stress enough that you should check out this new place on the block!",

We had the baba ganoush and the Lieutenant Dan. They ended up coming out together even though we were hoping to start with the baba ganoush. The baba ganoush was nice and creamy and had the perfect amount of smokiness. It was served with a delicious bread but definitely made it a heavier appetizer. The pizza was huge! It was a ricotta pie with chili oil, sorpressata, and basil. Their dough is great! It is nice and thin but still holds the pizza. I didn't really taste the heat of the chili oil, but the pizza was still delicious. Would love to come back and try their other pizzas! Prices for the pizzas are on the higher side, but we both had substantial leftovers so it was fine. Overall, a great place in Lawrenceville to grab some pizza.",

Pies are a bit more expensive, but that's because each one is carefully crafted - from the delicious sourdough crust to the house-made or otherwise locally-sourced toppings, everything on the menu is a perfect combination.  They have a nice beer list, but the place tends to get packed.

I went in a voracious, sober young lad and came out with a sophisticated palate for great pizza! (and a few pounds heavier)  Things I liked: - a great selection of flavors. I greatly appreciate that they're fairly simple, well thought out flavors and also very light pizzas. - pizzas as a whole were great! - service is wonderful. Our server was very patient, kind and had a great sense of humor! - I like that there's ample table space and that the restaurant doesn't feel too crowded. The pizzas are placed on an elevated surface to generate that sense of openness (great thinking!)  Things I didn't like: - would have appreciated a wider range of beers, perhaps a little of the entire spectrum. However, overall I think our party of 8 was very much satisfied! - The pizza flavors worked very well and had an overall nice balance of savory, aromatics, and saltiness. However, the crust was a bit bland and dry. Perhaps adding a bit more olive oil would help or altering the ratio of crust to each pizza, but what do I know I just eat...  Overall, a very positive experience for artisanal pizzas, I am looking forward to trying their other flavors!",

Luckily they're next to an antique shop, so you can wonder in there while you're waiting.   For dinner, we started off with the meatballs. Wow. For a person that doesn't really like meatballs, I absolutely loved these! Would happily order them again.   As for the Pizza, that was a hard decision! So many great ones to choose from.

As avid pizza lovers (and having both worked in pizza shops for years before), we loved Driftwood! It's definitely for thin-crust fans though, as it's a traditional thin crust style. So if that's not your style, maybe order one of their sandwiches (they sound delicious!) or go with a salad. We split the four cheese pie, and loved how the honey complimented the white base so well. (Wasn't expecting that!) I added some pepper flakes to mine and it was perfectly spicy and sweet. Great local beer/cider selection well, and the shop had an intimate, homey but modern feel to it.

We took a walk around the block for that time since the bar was full and it is a pretty small location. Once we were seated we decided on some beer and the meatball appetizer to start. The meatballs were delicious! They were slightly spicy and the sauce with the toast dipped into it was bomb. We decided on the Italian sausage pizza and thoroughly enjoyed it. One thing I wish they had more of was the sweet peppers, but no problem because the crust was the real star here. Thin sourdough crust with a wood fire bake. I normally don't eat the crust on the pizza, but this one I did! Overall, slightly pricey but not too bad, we each had 2 canned beers and split pizza and appetizers for under 30",

    "text": "I've had the Driftwood pizzas at various events the city, so I knew I had to make way to their brick n mortar shop in Lawrenceville! I love this spot. Their spot is awesome! There is a pizza/Pittsburgh mural on the wall. It feels very homey and relaxed.   We headed to Driftwood around 6pm on Wednesday evening. To my surprise - there were plenty of tables available. They must have recently changed they way that you order - because we were seated first and then ordered. We didn't have stand at the counter.   They have beer and wine on tap. I ordered a Dancing Gnome beer - but they lots of local brews available.   To start - we ordered the babaghanoush with the house made sourdough bread. It was very good. You gotta order it!   For our entrees- we shared the 16in Bianca Funghi pizza and the Classic Red pizza. The Bianca pizza was incredible- you gotta order it!! The classic pizza was just okay - we would try a different pizza instead next time!   Unfortunately, the wait staff took a long time getting our bill - but overall I enjoyed my night out at Driftwood.",

    "text": "So we finally made our way back to Driftwood at their new spot in Butler Ave in Larryville.  We'll start with the food: 4.5 stars The pizza - I can't say it is just as delicious as before, because it's different. You can see by the pictures that the pizza is cooked differently. That being said, this pizza is delicious in a different way. The crust is still unique because it it sour dough and the toppings are first class. I really enjoyed the red top slices. This crust differs from their standard pie as the crust is thicker. I wish I worked closer because I could definitely see myself grabbing a slice or two :) for lunch. The bread - yassss! Thick crusted, \"burnt\" tasting, soft center. Yum. My mouth is watering. I was also surprised now much I liked the baba dipping sauce. It is much sweeter and has more texture than I am used to (huge fan of pita land), but unique and tasty.  And finally - the service: 3 stars  I am not a huge fan of the set up. The ordering service reminds me of gaucho. Order at the counter and pray that there is some where to sit. You also have to continue to go back to the bar/hostess stand to order more drinks. It's complicated. It did not bother my husband but I would prefer to have a server. That being said, I have no idea if it will stay this way?   Regardless, I love their pizza so I'll be back - maybe even this weekend!",

Without fail, every visit provides friendly and excellent service. Definitely take the recommendations from your server as Driftwood is always trying something interesting and delicious - whether it be the rotating pizza specials or a new starter. Every dish I've ordered here has been amazing and it has pushed me outside of my comfort zone. The peach and corn pizza special this summer was something I would not think to try and it is now one of my favorites! My husband and I try to get to Driftwood as much as we can, for any occasion, with as many people as we can.   My go-to, date night order here starts with the baba ghanoush. It is a great way to try their delicious sourdough bread, experience an interesting mix of flavors, and feel slightly healthy while doing so! Next, split a mixed greens salad. It is seriously an amazing, flavorful salad that lets you taste how fresh their ingredients are. Finally, split a pie - I highly recommend going for a rotating special. A Mason's Best Friend or Major Tom are always goods picks, too. Last, split a Leona's ice cream sandwich or a salted dark chocolate cookie or two!",

Rocky IV was on tv instead of some lame sports game, which was a nice touch. We went later on a Sunday as service was winding down and only waited 25 minutes for a table. I suggest doing that if possible, since it seems like things could get pretty crowded during peak times.   My boyfriend had the meatball pizza and I got the Italian hoagie. It was hands-down one of the best hoagies I've ever had, and the homemade sourdough roll was the perfect thickness without being too crunchy. He raved about the pizza and devoured most of it on-site. One pizza with an appetizer or salad would likely be enough to share, but due to my dairy allergy we couldn't go that route. (They offer cheese-less vegan pizzas FYI.) I can't wait to come back and try a rotating Roman-style vegan slice and maybe get that hoagie again. Driftwood is certainly worth the attention it's been getting lately!",

Definitely needed more flavor to it. I wish I could have opted for a red sauce/sausage pizza but it was a Friday in lent, I'm a lax Catholic, I had to uphold some religious obligations.   I had to make room for dessert once I saw Leona's ice cream sandwiches were available. I went for the coffee snickerdoodle which was amazing.

We walked in and were seated right away on a weeknight at 6pm.... but they got much busier as we had our meal.   They have a great selection of local beers which are served in mason jars. Drinks in mason jars are automatically more enjoyable   Their pizza was really good and they had a wide variety of options. The pizza comes in one size and is good to spit with one or two other people depending on how hungry you are! They are each around $20 give or take a few bucks. They are a little pricier than your typically pizza, but the toppings are worth it!  We also had the kale Caesar salad.... and I loved it!! Super simple but just want I want when I think of a fresh and tasty Caesar    Each of the staff members that we interacted with were super friendly and helpful!! In particular, our waitress happily took the time to explain some of the pizzas to us and gave suggestions based on our preferences. I really appreciated that because it doesn't always happen!",

It's my favorite \"fancy\" pizza in the 'Burgh (I am categorizing classic take-out pizza separately because there is a difference between sit-down pizza and take-out IMO!) and I have shamelessly eaten way too much of it for my own good.   It's *always* busy at Driftwood, but it's definitely worth the wait. The flavor combos for some pies might scare away picky eaters by the description, but trust me when I say they know what they're doing (looking at you, Bianca with the honey sauce).   It's a little expensive, but it's artisan pizza. You can expect to pay about $30 for a pie with tip, but you WILL have tasty leftovers. DEFINITELY try Driftwood ASAP!",

I've walked past this restaurant serval times and it is always packed but somehow we got a table for two with no wait at 8pm on a Saturday. The servers were super quick with our orders. We asked to try their house red. It was very fruity and a little sour - really nice wine - but not for me. We ordered the bianca funghi pie and asked for them to go light on the cheese and white sauce. When they brought our pizza out, they restated our order back to us, bianca funghi with light cheese and white sauce, and it was great to hear this. The pizza was amazing - maybe the best in Pittsburgh. The crust is crispy and the toppings were fresh and flavorful. Putting chili oil on pizza is genius! For dessert we got the chocolate toffee cookies. They were 2 for $2, so why not? They were also amazing, and almost brownie-like topped with flaky salt. The pizza was a little expensive $25 isn't cheap, and with two drinks and a tip we spent over $50. Driftwood Oven is worth it, however, it is a great trendy establishment with amazing pizza and great service. We will be back!",

I refuse to use the overused term \"amazIng\" which is so popular these days and my wife kept repeating it in between bites. But I really enjoyed it! We had the eggplant parm pizza and also a sweet sausage, mushrooms and onion pizza. They were both delicious but I enjoyed the latter much more.  Four of us did an impressive job crushing them both. I have to say the beer prices were very reasonable too. $2.50-$6.50 ea. What else can I say? The service was fine, the staff was friendly. The order came out a bit slowly but it was worth the wait. All of that said I would recommend and return.",

I arrived at 6:30 and parked right outside.   Second - your entire party must be present or they won't seat you. Our party was not present. They have a bar, but it was really full so we opted to have a drink down the street. It was really busy when we returned but we were still seated promptly.   Third - the food/drink obviously! We started drinks. They have beers, ciders and wines. No cocktail menu. I had a wine on tap and we ordered two beers for others at the table. We started with the Pepperoni pockets. Our server recommended two to share. Two was plenty! We also order the Sargent Tom pizza - think olive oil, garlic, prosciutto, ricotta. Both were very good and the perfect amount of food.   I can't say it's the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh,  but worth a visit for sure.",

The decor is very cool with the tomato sauce can in the middle of the table. I would def go back to try other toppings since the broccoli taste is overpowered all other flavors with what I got this time. The price is a little but pricey, $24 for 6-8 slices.  The food took a while to come out so don't come super hungry like I did.",

    "text": "We decided to head down Lawrenceville to try out a \"new\" pizza joint and picked Driftwood Oven. While parking is off-the-street and at a premium, you can find parking on the back streets if you are lucky.   The overall decor has the cozy feeling of home with the aromas of sweet oven baked pizza. Walking into the place, the first thing you feast your eyes on is the brick walls and wood backed bar. The smiling host/hostess at the front is very cheerful along with the waiters.   The beer selection is locally brewed craft beers and some of the staple mainstream beers (ie. Coors Light, Yuengling, etc). Seating wasn't bad at all as we came at 2pm on a Sunday and were seated right away.   We ordered the pepperoni pocket for an appetizer and it was stuffed full with pepperoni and cheese. It was perfectly seasoned and the inside of the pocket was cooked but not over-cooked.  We then ordered the Archer Pizza, which is their spicy sausage pizza. It had a pretty decent kick to it and the sausage was the ground up type not the big chunks. The crust was crispy and not burnt and the pizza itself was cooked to perfection. We couldn't even eat it all.  Overall: Price was a little high for the food at $22 for a 12 cut but I will gladly pay more for great food and Driftwood definitely has phenomenal food. Will gladly recommend this place to anyone and come back.  P.S. --- Also there is a local brewery within walking distance to get drinks afterwards!",

We arrived at Driftwood around 7:00 on a Friday evening, and waited at the bar for a table. Their bar was stocked with several local craft beers, all served in mason jars. We were seated before we could finish our drinks, which was pretty impressive for a Friday night.   We decided on a Caesar salad and a pepperoni pizza (with pickled peppers and mushrooms) to split. Both were amazing and came out relatively quickly. I was pretty shocked by the size of their pizzas; we ended up taking half home, which turned into a great snack the following day.",

I loved that each pizza is made to order.  They have containers of the dough all weighed out and then prep whichever of their interesting menu pizzas you finally decided on. They have meat and veggie options. Around $10 for a pizza which comfortably feeds one. I got the basic margarita pizza. The crust was crispy on the bottom, and slightly chewy. The basil was slightly burnt on the edges from the heat of the oven, but I'm not sure how that would be prevented. It didn't taste bad, just some of the basil flaked off.  I thought the brick oven was really cool. It's a little different than most food trucks, which I loved.  Hope to see them around again soon.",

    "text": "We (2 adults and 2 kids) ate here a couple weekends ago and had a great experience. Restaurant  has a warm/modern/pizza joint feel about it. The vibe is calm but not dull. You order as you enter, then take a seat and full service from there. I like this because it really expedites things and forces you to decide what you want before you sit down. They were happy to make small changes in the pizzas for us. Service is very friendly and prompt. Salad was excellent and perfectly executed (rare these days); pizza is definitely in my top 3 in the city. Crisp, chewy crust, fresh toppings and just enough sauce. They have two draft beers (we liked them both) and a variety of bottled beers and a few wine choices. My only suggestion...please move closer to Regent Square!",

    "text": "I had this pizza at grist house brewery and it was extremely solid pizza. I cant image somebody making a better pizza out of a drive away wood fired oven. The guys who made the pizza's were extremely chill and the pizza's they made were True Neapolitan pizza. I had the margherita and it was apparent they made their crust and mozzarella in house. The crust was simply amazing, although a little soggy in the middle. Overall it was an extremely well done pie.",

    "text": "We had the McKees pizza. It had banana peppers, mushrooms, sopressetta, and Pecorino Romano (I think).  The pizza was good. I actually love brick oven pizzas so I was a huge fan. It had just a little too much burnt crust for my liking but it should be expected using an oven like that. I wish there were more banana peppers too because I love them!    I wish I could have tried a few more but I guess that is next time is for!! All in all, it was a super great experience and the staff was so kind to us and our dog which made me fall in love with them immediately. If I run into their food truck again, I'll definitely try another one!",

    "text": "Rockstar experience.    While it had been my original intention to take my Margarita pizza to go, my plan had been thwarted after I had taken that first bite.    I don't know how they did it, but between the sauce, the dough, and the rest of their ingredients and trade secrets, that was easily the best pizza that I had eaten in a LONG time.    Do yourself a favor... follow them on Facebook and make it a point to GO.  You are going to very impressed.",

    "text": "Sundays for us mean eating out (usually at Birmingham Bridge Tavern in the Southside for their pulled pork sundays) and usually enjoying some beer at a local brewery. We generally go to Voodoo in Homestead but we had been seeing the Driftwood Oven outside of Roundabout  and decide to switch it us and go there. We ordered a pizza with sausage and red sauce. It was delicious. The dough was cooked perfectly and consistent. I did wish it was brought to us a little warmer but overall I enjoyed the pizza. I also had a tasty shaved cheese on top that I think was asiago. I also comment on portion size and I thought this was a perfect lunch option. It was pretty small but shareable. The two of us had two, decently sized slices. I'm not sure that everyone would agree with the value (It was a little bit over $10) but I found it to be worth the quality. Overall, I was really happy to get to enjoy both the brewery and the pizza at once! I'm sure we will stop back the next time we want to stay close to our house for a little bit of Sunday fun!",

    "text": "What a unique idea for a food truck! These guys hit the mark spot on with a delicious crust and amazing toppings! We had the Margherita pizza, and were extremely satisfied!!  We shared the pizza with some patrons in our salon, and everyone was raving about it!  The truck was parked in the Southside and Riverpark Commons, and we work in a salon across the street. I went out to see what they were making & to chat a bit with them, and the smell was absolutely intoxicating. I had every intention to go back around noon to try the pizza; however, our day filled in with appointments, and I didn't have a chance to walk back over. One of the guys actually came over with a pizza for us! It was such a nice gesture, and he wouldn't accept money. I can honestly say that Driftwood Oven made our day. It is amazing to have nice things happen to you!   We wish you guys all the success in the world!!",

    "text": "Delicious pizza! Tried three of them: the Margherita, Market, and Toadstool. All of them were delicious and had distinct flavors; the Market pizza was my favorite! The pizza size was just right for a meal, though could be shared between two people if both eat little. Definitely give them a try. I'm already looking forward to their next visit!",
