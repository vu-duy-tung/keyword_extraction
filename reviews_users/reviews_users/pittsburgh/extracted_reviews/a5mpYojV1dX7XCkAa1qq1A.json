Ordered the same thing but service was poor. Employee left and ended her shift in the middle of my order. I was left waiting for fresh hot falafel b/c the others look old and dry. The worse part was that I had to tell the next employee how to finish my bowl since the first employee walked away. I was missing broth and falafel. Worst part is. after waiting the fresh falafel looked like dog food and tasted terrible. Maybe I should try something else but I'm not likely to return anytime soon.",

Ordered the chicken and rice noodle broth bowl and my husband had the steak salad!  The broth bowl was very bland!!! the vegetables are steamed first and then they add about 5 pieces of chicken and finish with Luke warm broth.   It ends up not blending the ingredients together and the vegetables are very hard!!!  Absolutely no flavor and very expensive too!!  The salad had more flavor but very little portion for an 11.00 dollar salad!!!  Then they give you what the girl said was a free piece of bread!! Again we were reminded it was free but it was not even a whole Slice it was a half a slice of bread!!!  Very disappointed would not be willing to spend that much money again!!!",

    "text": "Amazing! Try the Spicy Ginger Steak Broth Bowl - one of my favorites! I have to disagree with the previous review saying the Broth is plain and not salty enough. There is lots of flavor and quite a bit of salt (just look at the nutritional information).. It's bone broth, it's not Campbell's - it's meant to be healthier (Google about it). Besides the deliciously tender steak the kale is the best part! I literally stop in here 3-4 times a week and the kale has always been fresh and crisp. The salads are absolutely wonderful (I love bringing them into work when I want a night off from meal prepping) & the salad dressing is unique and very flavorful. This is probably not a place you want to go to if you are used to a highly processed unhealthy diet like McDonald's. Probably not a place children would appreciate if they are being raised on highly processed and unhealthy foods. I am so glad that Pittsburgh finally has a healthy, Paleo/Whole 30 friendly & very filling restaurant! Thank you CoreLife for coming to The 'Burgh. #HealthFood #BoneBroth #GameChanger",

I don't think mushy grey bean sprouts are the least bit appetizing. I know they just opened not too long ago, but they still have a lot of work to do. I hope they get it together soon.

The whole ordering process was confusing and the staff didn't seem to really understand or be able to help much more. Here's what I can tell you... don't order the soup (or at a minimum, ask them not to add kale... it was bitter and truly had no place in the soup).  The broth had little flavor, but did perk up a bit with the addition of PLENTY of salt. I did enjoy the chicken, however. I even tried to add some Sriracha to give it a Pho feeling, but mixed with the bitter kale, it made the broth almost inedible.  They accompany their soups with a 1/2 slice of grainy wheat bread, which unfortunately didn't add substance or flavor to the dish.  We did enjoy the tea and lemonade selections. They were unique (cranberry cayenne) and delicious.   Here's to hoping this is just a rocky start. Next time we'll try the wild rice bowls.",

Beautiful place, nice Whole Foods crowd, only problem food good not very good.  It was very difficult to figure out the menu between the grain, greens or broth bowls.  I ordered the ginger steak with rice noodles.  They poured in all the veggies into a bowl, then the (very) rare steak.  I was getting excited until they poured the dressing on and served it uncooked!  Ok healthy. I get it, but raw scallions, cold noodles and almost uncooked meat???   Went with wife and sister who both like to eat healthy.  Both had different grain bowls, basically salads.  Both very skimpy, wife felt they must have missed an extra protein.  Of course no soft drinks to wash down the raw kale.   Will not be back (wife might give it another try). Next time chipotle.",

The dish itself, made elegantly in front of me by Clara, was the coconut curry chicken and it tasted delicious. For many healthy dishes nowadays getting a bad rep for a trade off of flavor for health, this dish destroyed the healthy meal stereotype.

The only thing I would say- if you don't want a lot of dressing, ask for it on the side. My salad was drenched in Caesar dressing. My broccoli cauliflower soup was not very hot. Make sure to check the pricing as you are paying because they charged me almost 6 dollars more than they were supposed to. Good thing I caught it!",

I did not find the ordering process to be confusing at all, and the employees have always been friendly the times I have gone.  I can definitely see how some people may not be full after their meal. I think you just have to be self-aware of how much you actually need to feel full, especially if you're doing with a salad. I had a large greens bowl both times with the normal amount of protein, and I felt full afterwards. I do think the price you pay for the amount of protein you get could be lower. I got the tuna poke once and definitely would have appreciated a bit more for the money.  tl;dr: good healthy food option, maybe a bit pricier than what some would hope for, be aware of your own needs to feel full. check it out!",

I am all about healthy eating, whole foods, fresh foods because I really do believe when you eat better, you feel better. The set-up is like chipotle/hello bistro where you have the option of building your own bowl. They also have the calories of each bowl listed on the menu, so if you are watching your weight the numbers are right in front of you.   I stopped here on Saturday after I left my Barre class and decided to go with a pre-made grain bowl (thai chicken & rice noodles). You can either get a small or a large bowl; I ended up getting the small and thought it was plenty! The bowl comes with chicken, rice noodles, napa cabbage, sliced almonds, broccoli, cucumbers, cilantro and thai cashew dressing. I was very satisfied with the freshness of the bowl and how quickly it was assembled. *Note - do not expect a hot bowl, because these are served cold. I definitely want to build my own bowl next time, but I will have to decide on my selections before hand. I also had a very tasty raspberry tea from their handcrafted drinks line up; highly recommend trying these out.     Overall, the pricing is on point, the facility is fresh and modern and most importantly the food is wholesome.",

(I'll admit- my first time here I dined in and it wasn't great, but the other times have been takeout. Maybe there's something about the veggies sitting in the dressing for a little bit when getting takeout that makes it so tasty!)  The lemonade options are great! The cranberry cayenne is my favorite. It has an unexpected kick that is so yummy and not overwhelming if you don't care for spice.  CoreLife is a nice change from the other fast food restaurants available on McKnight and I'm glad it's an option!",

Corelife focuses on three types of bowls---grains, greens and broth bowls. You can customize your grains, greens or broth with whatever ingredients you like from their extensive options or choose from pre-determined recipes on the menu. I've only tried green bowls so far which as you could imagine, are salad based. I had the Caesar and Cobb green bowls. You can choose from small or large. Large is good if that will be your entire meal. It is a great portion. Small is more for a lighter appetite or if you'd like to also pair it with another menu item. They also have a great assortment of lemonades. I HIGHLY recommend the basil cucumber lemonade. It is so delicious!",

Very to the point menu, with a nice amount of options. It is a great place if you are looking for healthy food options. You place your order and they send it down the line to continue with other options to add. I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken and Chicken Power Plate on the two occasions I was there. Both had amazing taste! Loved it! Tasted fresh and very flavorful. So no issues there. However, the workers can seem a bit confused and scattered. I am not sure what that is about. And both times, they forgot something that I requested. The first time, I didn't notice until i got home. And the second time, I realized it while on my way out the door. Also, when I asked for extra ranch, the worker told me, well it is just supposed to be drizzled on your food. Ummm, please do not tell me how much dressing I should use. If I want extra ranch, then I want extra ranch. I don't need instructions on my taste preference. I asked for a side of broth and it was put in a drinking cup that had a sipping hole in the lid, and it was placed in the bag. I didn't realize the hole in the lid until a bit later. Thank goodness I didn't tip the cup over in the bag. It would have gotten all over the bag and possibly my car seat. Oh, and the ran out of bread. :(  So like I said, great food but just need a few minor adjustments. I will still come back and hopefully it will continue to improve.",

In the top of my photo is the Coconut Curry soup bowl and the Thai chicken on the bottom. They also gave complimentary bread.  The staff is very informative and gave suggestions on what tastes well based on what you like. The ordering style is about how you would order in Subway or Chipotle. The drinks are self serve and many lemonades to choose from. I would be back. The options are unlike other restaurants and I'd compare it to a pho-type style of dish.",

Just the right amount in a small bowl but if you want more you can go big for another dollar.  Service was very friendly and personable here. It was a nice day so we ate outside in a huge patio area. Definitely a great spot for large groups for space as well as variety for everyone to find something to eat. They do have WiFi if you bring your tech and want to hang.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Tuesdays ago with my father and goddaughter for lunch.  We were looking for a somewhat healthy place to eat that was close to us and CoreLife fit that bill perfectly.  It's located in the bottom part of the Block at Northway and has both indoor and outdoor seating.  Since it was winter whenever we visited there was no chance for us to sit outside.  That didn't matter though as the inside is pretty cavernous.  At the front of the restaurant is an area where you order your food and walk through the line adding some items like you would in a chipotle or subway.  After you pay you are free to choose your own seat and you ultimately bus your own table.  For lunch on this occasion I went with a spicy chicken and ancient grains salad while my dad went with a chicken bone broth soup.  Both of the employees that were working the line here were incredibly nice and talkative to both me and my goddaughter.  They even ended up giving us a very tiny cup of oranges for her which was very much appreciated.  My salad consisted of warm quinoa, antibiotic-free chicken, sriracha, shredded kale, broccoli, carrots, raw beets, scallions with a lime cilantro jalepeno dressing.  I really enjoyed the taste of it, especially the spiciness from both the sriracha and jalepeno dressing.  With all of the vegetables in it my salad, it felt really healthy as well.  For something that tasted this good it was a great bonus.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I loved how friendly the employees were and thought that my food was flavorful and healthy as well.",

The name of this place caught my attention and decided to try it out.  I was impressed with the large outdoor patio leading into the entrance. The interior is clean, colorful,and offers comfortable seating.  Ordering process can be easy, once you finally figure out what you want. I know the goal is to simplify the menu, and ordering process, but  because there are too many options the opposite occurred.   Salads rule here, toppings are in abundance, and the 14 freshly made dressings are as unique as they come.  Since I was expecting to see hearty and healthy soups, sandwiches and other entrees listed on the menu, I wasn't prepared for the brunt of the menu options to be salads and broths. The salad I ordered was freshly prepared and tasted great,  but did little to satisfy my hunger for the price paid.  I was thankful they included a complimentary piece of bread with my salad.  Corelife Eatery caught my attention, but I need to review and study the menu a little better to make sure I return from my lunch hour feeling like I ate lunch!",

The ordering process was more confusing and disorganized compared to other fast casual restaurants. The employees did not seem well trained as none of my simple questions were answered and the preparer did not know the correct ingredients for my bowl.  My first pick was the shiitake mushroom & roasted tofu broth bowl. The vegetable broth was so bland and tasteless that it might have just been tap water. I took two spoonfuls and that was more than enough. I talked to the staff and the manager was nice enough to let me order something else. This time, I went with the tofu green bowl. Once again, it was a complete letdown. The dressing was sour and the tofu was wayyy too salty. I never knew it was possible to mess up a salad this bad.",

    "text": "I ordered take out here the other week and had mixed feelings about this place. My favorite thing about here is that the menu targets eating a wide variety of healthy, low calorie meal that has big taste and a decent quantity. Side note: I strongly dislike healthy places that serve minimal amounts of food and call it \"healthy\" - it's only healthy because I'm leaving hungry!   I ordered the Spicy Chicken and Ancient Grains and the Coconut chicken curry soup as well as the ginger honey lemonade. The lemonade was a fail; it was overpoweringly bitter with no hint of honey and maybe a little ginger. The coconut curry however was good. It had a nice even spice to it and was very tasty. Same can be said about the spicy chicken and ancient grains which included beats, quinoa, kale, and seasoned chicken.   I appreciate healthy food this is promoting as well as giving you a decent sized meal. The price is very reasonable for both quantity and quality. I will keep this place in mind for when I want to go out for tasty meal that won't make me feel guilty.",

I have been here several times already and every single thing I've ordered has been flavorful with large portions, even for half sizes. Perhaps the team has been altering some flavoring based on previous reviewer experiences.  So far I've had the steak, bacon and bleu and the ranch flank steak salads. I've also had one of their noodle bowls. My boyfriend got their Thai noodle salad the other day which was also quite good. He mounds on the sriracha though, so not sure what it was like before that :)  Their cranberry cayenne lemonade is some of my favorite in the biz. The only thing I don't care for are the attitudes of their workers. I am rarely acknowledged when going through the line. Any customer service job demands that you at least semi-interact with the customer. I don't expect a red carpet, but at least smile and say hello.  I'll be back for sure. I love this place!",

    "text": "Since they are building up The Block Area and this is one of the first restaurants to open up, I definitely wanted to check it out!  I had read about the concept and was intrigued.  You either choose from remade favorites or build your own bowls. You can do greens, grains or a combo. Pick your veggies which are all prominently displayed and fresh, then pick a protein if you wish. They also have a number of homemade dressings for your bowls. If you'd like, you can also get soups.  The set up is an assembly line similar to a Subway or Chipotle.  When I was greeted, I was asked if this was my first time and when I said yes, they were happy to explain and walk me through the process.  It's fairly simple but there are a lot of options so it can seem overwhelming at first. You can also go for a small or big bowl.  I decided to go with a pre-made favorite, the Sriracha Ginger Roasted Tofu but subbed out the Tofu for Ahi Tuna.  It came with Baby Spinach, Shredded Kale, Broccoli, Carrots, Sprouts, Ginger, Basil and Sriracha with a Carrot Chili Vinaigrette.  It was excellent!!!  Everything was fresh a flavorful. I will most definitely be coming back and trying more offerings!  If you like eating with chop sticks, you can do that. While I opted just for water, they have plenty of drink options on the healthy side and not just Pop.  Speaking of healthy, that is their theme. They are going for a healthier option for eating out. I'd say they are doing fairly well in that area. They put a nice twist on salads that I find welcoming.",

It was just something new and it was close by. I was actually very impressed after my visit. The place itself is very clean and very spacious. They have tons of seating inside as well as numerous tables outside on their patio.   Foodwise I went with the Ginger steak and noodle bowl. A decision that was very hard to make and something that I typically would never order. I was very pleased with my selection. I never would have thought of mixing rice noodles with kale but now I'm thinking of ways I can incorporate that concept into my own meals! That is one thing I think that makes Corelife stand out from other places in Pittsburgh which is oh so important being the huge food city that it is.   Saving the best for last, I want to talk simply about their lemonades. I think seeing their different lemonades online was mainly the reason I decided to give it a try. While they still have your average lemonade they have a lot of unique flavors you'll never see anywhere else. First I tried the cucumber basil lemonade and I absolutely loved it. It was so refreshing and those flavors are surprisingly good together which I wouldn't have expected. Before leaving I also tried the cranberry cayenne lemonade. It was also delicious but a little too sweet for me. If they sold pitchers of their lemonade to go I would definitely buy one!",

So I passed this spot on the way to Saks off Fifth and thought, thank god, I'm going here for lunch! I had been here once before but really couldn't remember what I got and how I liked it. I am SO glad that when I asked if a certain bowl was gluten free, they said everything is gluten free other than the side of bread you can request. How awesome and easy is that?   So I went with the Spicy Thai Chicken & Rice Noodle with Napa cabbage, spicy Thai rice noodles, spicy chicken, peppers, scallions, sesame Sriracha sprouts, Thai chili sauce. Let me tell you, it was DELICIOUS! I want it right now for lunch... sad they're not around me! I also downed two cups of the cranberry cayenne lemonade. I'm officially hooked and will be back soon. Also glad that it's not a heavy dish and healthy!",

    "text": "ack, i went here for the second time today. i first went here when it opened and i got a reasonably good meal.   this time i went, it took a serious turn for the worst. i first walk in, their layout is a bit odd, you can see all the food options as you are walking down to order, but i'm sure as others might do, they forget what they want. so here i was running back and forth to remember what i wanted. i get some rendition of a power plate, corn, quinoa salad, and ahi tuna. while she was putting together my plate, she was pulling off something on my quinoa and i'm pretty sure it was a hair, and i got super scared but i tried to not let that bother me. i asked for extra quinoa and she just used the \"warm\" quinoa. so now i had two quinoas of different temperatures on my plate. when i are the quinoa. it all tasted one temperature. ice cold. i'm waiting to purchase my meal, and all of a sudden a big hubbub is going on behind the counter. this woman is ordering tofu, and the tofu isn't done. the workers are inspecting the tofu, to see if it is, and they jiggle it around in the pan, OML THE TOFU IS LIKE A BOUNCY BALL, i think even some bounces onto the floor lol. as this is going on the workers seem to be having a very \"quiet and secret\" discussion about whether to serve the tofu to customers. i have never worked in the food industry, but i think if you have to discuss whether this is ok to serve, the answer is usually no. thankfully they cooked the tofu longer. so, that ordeal took 5 minutes.  so i am finally buying my meal, my sad plate of cold food. so i'm waiting for my card to go through or something, i really don't know. nobody there looked like they had a clue what was going on. so this young girl comes out from the back and says \"we are out of bread\" 1, how can you be out of bread, it's one of those staple foods that are plentiful, right? 2, the other guy working there gets really frustrated and starts yelling at me and the workers. so i wasn't very happy about that.  okay, i finally get to my seat, the floor is really sticky and i was just really disappointed. i am all for a better environment, but i hate using metal utensils at restaurants. based on just walking around core life i was not optimistic about the sanitation in that store. so i was not happy about using a fork that was used by many others.  so i finished my meal. i go and clean up my table. so i'm putting back my bowls and silverware in the dirty dishes. i look to where you put the utensils. oml i almost barfed. i was disgusted at the sight of an overflowing container of peoples used utensils. i am in a bacteria, virus, infectious disease unit at school, and woah just woah, i can't even go into details, i feel sick just writing this.  OVERALL: core life was really unsanitary, and i will definitely not be going back there. the workers were completely clueless, and all looked like it was their first day. the food wasn't that bad, it was just cold. and the layout of the restaurant is confusing and tight, despite the fact that no one was there. when i got home i was running a high fever (it went down) i felt like i had a very mild food poisoning incident oo",

I was disappointed to find that the chicken was not hot.  The cold chicken, covered in a spicy sauce along with the other ingredients was just not a great combination.  However, I could tell the ingredients were fresh and flavorful, so I decided to give it another try.    My second trip I ordered the chicken tortilla and chipotle chicken broth bowl.  This meal was delicious!  The bowl came with chicken, spinach, rice, black beans, corn, cotija cheese, and was topped with tortilla strips.  All of the flavors came together perfectly!  On top of the great taste, it is good knowing that you are not putting anything bad into your body when eating here.  Will definitely be back to try some of the other food and drink options.",

    "text": "My first experience with this regional chain was in the Cleveland area so you can imagine my delight when a location opened in the Block at Northway in the Pittsburgh area.  Corelife is my go-to for a healthy lunch or dinner when I'm shopping in the North Hills. Where else can locally can you get an ancient grains bowl or bone broth based entree?  My usual order is the tuna poke grain bowl with a slice of the complimentary bread. It's a fast casual setup like Chipotle so if there's a line it moves quickly. And there is plenty of seating, even for large groups.  Why not 5-stars because their execution can be hit or miss (out of quinoa, put away ingredients away for night an hour before they close, have to wait while the \"make\" up more tuna). Today's experience was good and it's never been so bad I stop coming. It's a fresh change from other options in the area.",

The flavorful options and serving sizes were great, which made the prices extremely reasonable.

The Fire Poke Bowl at Corelife is amazing! I made some small changes to it, only did half the rice, added extra cabbage, carrots, edamame, and didn't use the fire sauce, and it was the best poke I have had outside of Kauai. Seriously!   The price was a little high, but there was enough food here to feed me 2 full meals, so I wasn't unhappy with that. I just wish that there was a Corelife closer to my house!",

After looking at the nutrition of their foods, you really cannot go wrong. They have the menu leading up to the counter WITH PICTURES so you can take your time deciding what to get before reaching the counter. They have options like salads, broth bowls, and grain bowls. Once there you place your order and they prepare it in front of you.  The woman who took our order was SO NICE and personable. I felt we were long lost friends! I had the kale Caesar chicken salad and my husband had  the spicy Thai chicken and rice noodle bowl. Both were very good! I'm a huge kale fan so I was so happy they had a salad kale based! With the salad you were allowed 2 free toppings and could either modify the salad or keep the original recipe. I kept everything the same and added cucumbers, yum!  We tried two of the homemade juices they offer. The beet lemonade and the tropical green tea. Honestly, I was not wild about either but they were alright.   If you are in the mood for a healthy lunch on the go, this is a perfect spot!",

They have really revamped it with new businesses including this one.  Corelife Eatery combines fresh organic ingredients in a fast concept. You don't have to ruin your diet just by eating out. Compared to other concepts similar to this one in the area, this beats them for me. They offer a variety of food on their menu that isn't just exclusive to salads. You can get rice bowls, juices etc...  Immediately, I noted the fresh vegetables along the wall. They looked bright and not brown. Their lettuce is actually the nutritious lettuce and not intermixed with iceberg to create volume.   I really liked the different flavors offered in their bowls. They gave you more eclectic options such as falafels, beats, and chicken marinated in balsamic.   The bowl I got was a spicy Thai rice bowl. It was very good. Even though it was a set  recipe, I could tailor it to get exactly what I wanted. The only thing I did not like was that there was too much rice. Otherwise I will definitely be returning, when I visit my hometown!",

The menu is on the board but a description is given in the line area of salads, broths, grains, and build your own. Some of the items come in two sizes and usually you can get a meal for under $10.00 if you are not purchasing a drink.  I ordered a sriracha ginger tofu topped with grains. My husband got a salad with hummus. It comes with half a slice of bread complimentary. Drinks are extra but you get unlimited refills. I opted for the cider tea which I thought was different. They prepare your food right in front of you with the ingredients you can see through the glass.  The bowl I ordered had much kale in it and although I like kale I found my meal just too bland. The sriracha sauce was put on the side but when I tried it found it just too spicy for my taste. My husband seemed to enjoy his salad. It is nice that they give healthy food options and the calorie count but this place just didn't cut it for me.  Chances are I won't be returning. This place is hit or miss depending on your taste. For me it was a complete miss.",

The option for roasted vegetables is sweet potatoes and beets.  A majority of the vegetables shown in the pictures are not available. I do not think I'll be back.",

    "text": "Ok I couldn't decide between the ranch flank steak rice bowl or shiitake mushroom  & roasted tofu broth bowl.   The flank steak was pictured with brussel sprouts ... yum. In execution, I wasn't a fan of the pickled onions, roasted medley parsnips turnips etc (no brussel sprout), or (holy hot) pickled jalapenos.  The falafel was bland and hard.  The flank steak and rice blend were pretty good.  The ranch dressing (greek yogurt, mayo, buttermilk, mustard, lemon juice, parsley, scallions, garlic, dill, onion, kosher salt, & white pepper) would make a very good veggie dip if a little thicker.  Those customers around me were enjoying their meal and cleaning their plates  Just not a fan.  Service good.  Lots of parking.",

Everything always tastes delicious and fresh and the staff is always very sweet. I also love the open seating in the center and their apple cider tea is phenomenal (I'll be sad when it's switched out!)",
