The staff here are incredibly nice and the atmosphere is so laid back! I had the Amsterdam French toast and that Turkish sausage is basically like chorizo so if that's your speed, I highly recommend it! My breakfast date had the Belgium crepe with cookie butter - and it was also phenomenal! I will definitely be coming back any time I'm craving crepes for breakfast!",

It's also next to a bunch of shops that you can visit before or after your meal.  Personally, I felt the food was average. I got the Marseille crepe, which felt a little heavy on the harissa. It came with a small side of greens. The portions are enough, but probably won't fill you up if you're arriving ravenous or have a larger appetite.",

When I walked in, it looked cute and trendy but nothing could have prepared me for how long we had to wait to get our order taken and subsequently wait for the food. I think the whole experience took about 2 hours which is just not acceptable. The flavors were a bit bland (I can't even remember what I ordered I just ate in fury, fuming at how long it took).  There are plenty of other crepe places in Pittsburgh that can serve you in a timely fashion. Advice to this restaurant? Don't seat people until you know you can serve them. I'd rather be told upfront there will be a 40 minute + wait than to be seated so then I can decide if I want to do that or not...",

    "text": "Cafe Moulin is a nice french style cafe that falls a bit short on delivering a french experience.  I had high hopes for this place but as someone who grew up in Europe and ate crepes every week since I could remember I also had high exceptions  First of all if u want to make crepes take an egg, a cup of flour, a cup of milk and some salt ... mix it.  Take that mixture and pour a small amount in a frying pan and swish it around to cover the bottom... you are welcome I just saved you $10   I remember coming to a crepe place in a basement for french class in 10th grade, and just being astounded at how good it was.  I want to say it was Cafe Moulin, or its predecessor... im not sure, either way my experience went from amazing to meh.   I came here primarily because a friend had never had \"french\" crepes. And unfortunately she left without having any.  Long story short... 4 crepes and $40 later we had what amounted to a meh experience.  Some of the savory crepes were decent but more of a snack than a meal.  As for the dessert crepes soooooo disappointing with the selection.  Half of the crepes or more had nutella on them So if u put nutella on a crepe u reallyh only have a few options nuts, crumbs or bananas.  the taste is so strong and overpowering that it makes the fruit sour or just eliminates it.  All of the crepes we had though well cooked were just not complex and lacked unique ingredients.  Service was slow took a while to get the crepes though it didnt seem terribly busy.  Though the crepes were nothing great or unique i would come back for the other things on the menu",

Now most of the brunch places do not take reservations and Cafe Moulin is no different. I have had a couple of their savory and sweet crepes, coffee and also their french toast. All that I have had so far was fresh, light and very delicious, but specifically the French Toast was definitely my favorite. I also much prefer Cafe Moulin's crepes over Crepe Parisienne in Oakland. Much better quality, fresher ingredients and nicer atmosphere. I find the staff very friendly and approachable. Last time we were 3 people and in order to get in quicker we were sitting at the \"bar\" right next to the kitchen. It was a bit uncomfortable for 3 people (but that was our fault as we asked to sit there) so as soon as we spotted a table becoming available we asked the owner if it would be possible to switch and it was absolutely no problem at all. Every time I am here I feel welcomed and the food is amazing. What more can you ask for?",

No one was taking names or anything. Waiters and waitresses walked past us without a second glance. One couple decided to just sit themselves. I finally went up to a waitress and asked, \"Do we have to stand in line or does someone take our names down?\"  ...and she tells us she will put our names on the list (then doesn't ask for anyone else to be put on the list). We wait another 20-30 minutes and watch as others in line become frustrated and leave as they realize no one is attending to the line of hungry people. Basically you had to stand in line, to wave down a waitress and request to be put on a list.  We are finally seated and have our order taken (we request some waters and coffee). After 15 minutes we flag down the waitress and request our waters and coffee again--seems we had been forgotten, as others who arrived after us had already been served.   I ordered the cheesecake crepe and it was disgustingly sweet with mounds of white chocolate chips and almost no marscapone cheese.   Overall, there was no organization or customer service. Probably won't be back here again..",

The manager replied to my previous review and requested we give them a second chance and assured us that things would be different and we wanted to give them another opportunity .  We went this afternoon and things were different right from the start. We had the same waitress, who told us to sit anywhere we wish. We received cold water and each ordered a different ice tea.  Both were served promptly and were delicious. Our waitress was extremely friendly and took good care of us.  I ordered the same crepe as last time, the Cheesecake, with the same request of no chocolate, and was told no problem. V ordered a savory crepe. Both came out exactly as ordered and delicious. Mine was so good that I even had some friendly assistance finishing it!  Overall, this experience made up completely for what happened last time. The manager lived up to his word and delivered a great experience both in terms of service and food. I guess this goes to show that it is always worth giving a second chance, especially when management was so quick to apologize after our last experience instead of just dismissing our comments.   I am not sure how review updates work, if this score will replace my old one as I hope or if I need to delete my previous review because I feel that it no longer represents this restaurant. All of the issues I mentioned in my first review have been addressed and corrected and I recommend Cafe Moulin to anyone who wants a nice crepe, savory or sweet, or a nice french toast. They have a great selection of tea, that they can serve iced (I am a tea fanatic) so give this cozy cafe a try.",

I got the Alaskan crepe which had spinach, smoked salmon, and an herb cream cheese. The salmon tasted very good and the cream cheese appeared whipped as it was smooth and airy. The crepe also came with a small salad on the side. The greens were a spring mix with slices of apple and a light vu egrets on it. It went really well with the dish I also split a dessert crepe that was covered in nuts, filled with Brie, and had maple syrup in it. I thought it was equally as good as the Alaskan crepe. The menu is loaded with sweet and savory crepes. If you don't find something you like, you can make your own. I really enjoyed running into a spot that is clearly not your everyday spot. Pittsburgh isn't really a hot bed for crepes. If you want something different, I'd suggest it as definitely being worth a shot.",

    "text": "Ordered breakfast from Postmates, the Chef Salad (entree) and French Toast with both strawberries and banana- each at extra cost for add on. The salad that arrived was small- a side salad size container, which is not an $11 salad. It's supposed to have only avocado, goat cheese, over easy eggs, tomatoes. I received lettuce, 2 fried to death oily eggs, and a small amount of oily sauteed zucchini and onion. No avocado, no goat cheese, and with the addition of disgusting oily vegetables suited only for inclusion in something else, not as THE salad components. The menu offers a House Salad (no eggs) that includes these vegetables but also avocado, goat cheese, and pumpkin seeds- none of which were on my salad. So it wasn't a mistake but rather a throwing together of pieces of junk from two different menu items, omitting all of the expensive ingredients that make up the substance of these salads, and resulting in a completely unacceptable and inedible mess that I immediately threw away.  The French Toast arrived cold. The extra fee banana that I'd expressly instructed be only included if firm bananas were available (because my last order with them used overly ripe, mushy banana)- 5 thin slices of overly ripe, mushy banana. The extra fee strawberries- ALL unripe, gross and poor quality and the side was half blackberries instead. The two add ons paid for equalled a total volume of one add on as well. With only half the syrup for an order too, this means really only half the order of 2 toast has any topping and all the fruit is gross (omitting my 4 super tiny, unintended blackberries).   Pro tip: If you don't have ALL of the key ingredients required of a menu item offered, don't slop on some crap and have it delivered, just cancel the order for that item or offer a real substitute. And if you can't get, or won't pay for, strawberries in season, then put blackberries or something you can obtain in sufficient quantity and quality on your menu item instead of promising one thing and then delivering a partially substituted and ridiculously low quality version of the ingredients someone paid for in reliance of the menu description.",

The harissa sauce was DEFINITELY different, in fact, it was that roster hot sauce. I'm really sad about the lack of harissa. Other than that service is always great and food is good.",

It's a small place so you may have to wait longer for a table because of the size of your party. We were finally seated, and our orders were fast though.   I forget how much I love crepes until I eat them. I don't have them very often, but now that I had them here recently, I really want to go back. I had turkey, avocado, goat cheese and bechemel sauce and it was so good. The goat cheese was a little overpowering in some bites, but worked well overall. My friend and I split a dessert crepe and it was definitely too much food, but totally worth it. The crepes are perfect and the fillings just work together.   The coffee was good. I had a latte and it wasn't the best, but if I was eating crepes, I'd get a latte there again. The crepes are amazing though. I can't wait to go back.",

I have gotten the Marseille crepe a few times, and my friend usually gets a sweet one, like the Halle Berry :D - you can't go wrong with either. Highly recommend getting both the pesto (I'm pretty sure is homemade) and the harissa sauce for your savory crepe! It is so delicious. Usually not a big fan of going to the same place more than once, especially since I'm only in Pittsburgh for the year, but I have no hesitation making brunch plans here even having been here about 4 or 5 times already. Quick and friendly service. Limited seating and it can get loud inside, but it's a great place to catch up with 1 or 2 friends in a relaxed atmosphere. Try this place at least once! You'll be back, I promise :)",

There was a wait to be seated and the cafe does not take reservations, so make sure you have time if you decide to go. However, you can put your name on the list and take a stroll around Walnut street while waiting.  I ordered their sweet crepe \"Walnut Street\" with has a Brie filling and is topped with walnuts, granola, powdered sugar, and maple syrup and comes with the whipped cream on the side. I also ordered a side of egg whites.   While the meal itself was a bit smaller than I would have liked, the crepe was absolutely delicious. The inside was nice and creamy with paired really well with the toppings. The additional egg whites on the side made the meal filling.  Even though this place is a little bit on the pricy side, you can tell the food is made with quality ingredients. Highly recommend Cafe Moulin!",

It's always a little busy but I usually go on weekdays so it's never been packed.  My favorite crepe is definitely the Bristol! It's a perfect blend of turkey, avocado, cheese, and creamy goodness. It feels like comfort food but it's light enough so you don't feel bad about it afterwards (which is always good). The crepes are slightly cripsy on the outside, and super soft and light when you bite into them. They also come with a small side salad!  For coffee, I either opt for the bottomless brewed or the latte, and they both hit the spot for me. Overall, the ambience, service, and food here makes this one of my favorite brunch places in Pittsburgh!  *** Also if you're a student, make sure you use the Yelp coupon to get 10% off!",

I ordered a create your own crepe, which I got honey, granola, strawberries and whipped cream on top. My friend ordered the classic french toast with bananas. Wow! It was so good. The crepe was perfectly cooked. The french toast had a hint of cinnamon in it, which made it even warmer tasting and more delicious. I had a good experience and would definitely return.",

My party of four came on a Saturday lunch at around 12 pm and had to wait quite a bit for a table, but once we were seated, everything ran smoothly. I ordered the Walnut Street crepe and my friends ordered the classic French toast, Ottawa crepe and Tivoli crepe. My friend also ordered the Turkish coffee. The Walnut crepe was very sweet and filling; the texture of the crunch and the soft crepe were complimentary. I tasted the other dishes as well and will praise the savory crepes! I wished I had gotten that instead.  The Turkish coffee was a bit odd though. At the bottom the coffee grinds were left behind and they looked like dirt and tasted sooo bitter! We've never had a Turkish coffee so maybe that's the style? It was amusing trying to taste the grinds and figure out what to do with it. Overall it was a good experience. The food was fairly priced and tasted incredible! I would just come at a better time so our wait would not be so long.",

The staff is always very friendly, and the food never takes longer than 10 minutes to receive, even when every table in the restaurant is full. There's a lot of menu options and you can customize your own crepe, or you can have waffles, French toast, or a panini if that more fits your style!  I tend to order a savory crepe for protein and a dessert crepe for my sweet tooth when I go because it's too hard to pick just one. I highly recommend everyone to try the Super Belgium because their Belgium cookie spread literally melts in your mouth, it's unbelievable!  Prices are fair for the amount you get, and they accept both cash and cards. Happy Brunching!",

The only difference is where I am at the time, and how big a party I have.   Crepes Parisiennes is on S Craig St. Street parking if you are driving and good luck finding a space on Craig. The shops have ~10 tables, and its customer base is Pitt + CMU + UPMC.  Small shop means it is likely packed.  Go in, line-up, order, find a table, and they bring the food to you when ready.  Definitely should try this out if you are a student nearby.  Cafe Moulin is in Shadyside, Walnut Street area, next to a parking lot. About ~25 tables I guess.  At least I never have to wait in the line.  Go in, they will find you a table, and the waiter will take your order and bring the food over.  If you are driving, or with a big party (6+), I would prefer Cafe Moulin.  Foodwise, cappuccino, Latte, chocolate strawberry crepe, smoked salmon crepe... I am going to say Cafe Moulin's smoked salmon crepe (Alaskan) has more salmon than Crepes Parisiennes... but it is also more expensive ($11 vs $10)... and it might be just that day.  So don't take my words for it.",

It's almost an hour away but I braved the frigid temperatures and traffic to try this out. Worth it? Absolutely not.   Prices are HIGH and portions are TINY. I got the Mykonos French toast dish with 4 thin, dinky slices of \"spicy\" sausage. This was already $10 and I was not full or impressed. The French toast slices were thin and unseasoned without the syrup. The menu claimed it was butter maple syrup but those are lies. I just got a tin cup with regular cheap syrup. Hubby ordered the Bristol crepe ($10) but was afraid the portion would be too small so added eggs ($2) on top. He said the taste was good but it was way too dry. It claimed to have bechamel sauce but definitely not enough.   I commented that the only authentically Parisian element about this place were the bathrooms. The door actually brushes against the toilet seat. This is all the room you get. I'm critical because I've had delicious crepes in Paris and not only are they not very pricey, they are a silkier, buttery taste that is lost on this poor substitute in the U.S. It was dim, stuffy, crowded and run-down (or hipster style). I would not recommend this place or go back myself. Give me First Watch or IHOP any day.",

I'm so glad I took them up on the offer of bringing me an omelette because it was perfectly cooked and a great addition. The three of us split a banana and nutella crepe for an after breakfast treat which was also delicious.  I will say, I don't think it's cute here or even special. It's in what is essentially a basement. It is not well decorated. But all of those things are okay! Just accept Cafe Moulin for what it is- a solid and affordable breakfast joint.",

If I hadn't shouted to her that we had been waiting, she'd have seated others who came in after us first.  They need a greeter on busy days to avoid chaos.  I ordered a crepe with fire roasted chicken and harissa.  If there was three ounces of chicken, i'd be surprised, more likely two.  I spent most of my meal thinking, well, there'll probably be some in the next bite. Don't get me wrong, the crepes are good, but prices are a bit high to be skimping.  Paid extra for avocado and literally got about a sixth of a small avocado.  Yes, Americans are spoiled on portion size, but this place needs to get a clue.",

The service is friendly and fast, and the wait staff didn't mind answering a lot of questions for first timers (no the sausage is not spicy, yes dark chocolate pairs as well with raspberry as white chocolate does). I had the French toast, specifically the Mykonos Platter, and it was absolutely delicious. The sausage was tasty and the perfect portion. And, while I typically don't go for the pricier beverages, if you are a fan of chai and don't get the chai tea latte you are absolutely doing yourself a disservice. This was one of the best chai teas I have ever tasted.... ever.... and I drink a lot of chai anywhere I go. If it was just a bit less expensive, I might have crossed into five stars but this is definitely a shadyside breakfast experience worth having!",

It took the server about 15 minutes just to get us water.   I got the Nutella hot chocolate which was delicious. It was not too sweet and had a nice hint of nutella.   We split 3 dishes between the two of us. The Marseille crepe was nice and the side salad was good. The French Walnut Street French toast was a bit heavy for both of our tastes and extremely savory. We did not like it that much. The Super Belgium sweet crepe was also very savory. I did not like it that much, but my girlfriend liked it.   If you do not have a sweet tooth, I would recommend to keep to the savory crepes.  When we left, nobody greeted us out.  Nobody took my money, so we just left the money on the table and left. I thought this was slightly unprofessional and rude. Like I said, they seem understaffed.",

Especially during a weekend, it is reasonable to expect a wait time of 10-15 minutes.   I ordered spinach and feta with eggs the first time. It is good. Their crepes are thick and well cooked. They serve it with a salad and it is usually fresh. My friends ordered the Alaskan and chicken (Marseille) crepes both of which they thought are tastier than the spinach and feta. So, if you are not a vegetarian, you might want to consider ordering those over the vegetarian options.   The second time, I started with a cup of Cappuccino and I am pleasantly surprised by the creaminess. This time I ordered the Tivoli which is served with tomatoe pesto, spinach and mozarella. By the way, tomatoe pesto is also used in alaskan crepe and it is delicious.   I will go back again and try the Alaskan or Marseille crepes next time. Very good place for both vegetarian and meat eaters when it comes to savory crepes.",

It has very cozy feel to it... I almost felt like I was dining in someone's home. They have an open kitchen which was cool but potentially bothersome due to the heat being produced in such a tiny space. The back of the restaurant was HOT. The tiny air conditioning unit in the front of the restaurant didn't suffice. Also, the are very close together. Didn't necessarily bother me but just be aware that it's probably not a good spot if you're with a large group.   Menu: Pretty extensive list of sweet/savory crepes, a build your own crepe option, and other breakfast staples including French toast, waffles, eggs, sausage, etc. Decent prices... crepes seemed to range from $6-10.   Food: I tried the banelle crepe (banana, Nutella, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream on the side). Presentation was really nice... definitely picture worthy. It was very good. Very sweet and light. I would highly recommend to others!  Service: Good. We were immediately greeted by a very friendly employee. There was a 20-30 minute wait but the guy was really friendly and kept us updated throughout the wait. Our server was nice as well.",

The place is tiny but inviting.  As it was just myself, I opted for counter space sitting on a stool with no back, but there are several tables with chairs, as well.  The menu options are mostly crepes, divided into sweet and savory.  I opted for the Tivoli, a savory crepe with mozzarella, spinach, and tomato, with pesto sauce.  I wish they would use the Oxford comma because it is confusing on their menu as it is listed as \"spinach, tomato and pesto sauce\" which leads one to wonder if it contains tomatoes and has pesto sauce or if it contains tomato pesto sauce.  I was hoping it was the former and it was, gratefully.    It comes with a side salad with house French vinaigrette dressing.  I thought the portions were excellent, the taste very good, and the price of 14.79 which included a diet coke to be fine for lunch.  I will say I loved it but, as far as wanting to return with my husband for a weekend breakfast?  I think the space is too small for a drive here specifically for this restaurant only to probably find it is very busy and there is no place inside to wait for a table.  Off-hour visits would be best.",

I would be a little more understanding if the place was short staffed, but nope - there weren't too many customers and there were several waitresses. As soon as we stepped in someone told us \"sit anywhere\". We sat down at a table and she made us get up and said \"any of the small tables\". Once again, we sat down and she moved us another time. She took our order and we didn't see her again until the end when she gave us our check without asking if we wanted anything else. My boyfriend got the Sofia omelette crepe, which was supposed to have sausage in it. It was a sad looking omelette with three pieces of sausage on top. Not the best prices either. The Nutella hot chocolate tasted like one of those prepared powdered ones (no Nutella flavor) and cost $4. Their vanilla latte tasted nothing like vanilla and also cost $4. We paid about $35 for very very very average food and poor service. I don't recommend going here unless you're starving and happen to pass by.",

    "text": "Cafe Moulin is a tiny, almost hole in the wall, little French restaurant right off walnut street in Shadyside. And I am so glad I decided to give it a try. We went around 11:30 on a Saturday and were told the wait would be up to 20 minutes but I think we waited for less than ten. The food deserves 5 stars, but the service was a little lacking. The waitress was slow to come over to us, didn't bring us waters, and took a good ten minutes after we'd finished eating to bring the check by. But I would still go back. If you love crepes, this place is a must try. I had a vanilla chai tea and the Bristol savory crepe, which has turkey, goat cheese, and avocado in it and it was to die for. Then for desert we split a cheesecake crepe. I have to say, it was better than the crepe I had while visiting Paris. I will definitely be back.",

And it's definitely not a breakfast you attempt to make at home unless you're prepared to spend all morning in the kitchen perfecting your technique.   Anyway, really wanted to try a cool latte or hot chocolate after seeing pics of their foam designs but needed some normal coffee. It was good. For the crepes, I went sweet with the raspberry white chocolate and mascarpone and my friend went savory. Here had chopped up chicken and Swiss and some sort of hot sauce. We were both happy with our picks. I almost got the Halle Berry crepes, and a lot of people around me ordered them. I bet they're also good. Cute little rustic place half-underground, would definitely return!",

It's small but cozy and the friendly, attentive service made it a wonderful experience.   The Halle Berry crepe was good--sweet and smothered in Nutella--and will surely satisfy any sweet tooth.   I also tried their salad, which was average and nothing really special (apparently, the goat cheese is quite unique but I am unfortunately not a fan of the strong goat-y aftertaste of goat cheese). But the waiter did inform us that they are updating the menu soon to include more salads so keep an eye out after around Christmas '17!   Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Cafe Moulin and will probably return to check out their revamped menu.",

They were not able to make a French toast without milk (they carry non dairy milks) they do not have a vegan crepe batter. They do not have any tofu or meat substitute. Their only vegan option is a salad. Which is mostly just lettuce with avocado once you remove all the animal products. Oh, if you have a dairy allergy you can also have an egg omelette.   The coffee and the service was good.   Just not what I expected when I came to a nice restaurant in a nice part of town.",

My sister and I visited Cafe Moulin before we headed to the airport to leave Pittsburg. I ordered the Bristol - Smoked turkey, goat cheese, avocado and bechamel sauce and a side of bacon,  a Nutella hot chocolate, and she ordered a dessert crepe which was filled with cookie butter and topped with bananas and strawberries (sorry I forgot the name).  The Bristol was surprisingly underwhelming. The bechamel was a little bland and did not go as well with the turkey and avocado as I was hoping it would. Eating the bacon with it, gave it a better taste to me, but then I felt like I was eating a turkey, bacon & avocado sandwich. :(  My sister's crepe was really good and was a good way to satisfy a sweet tooth without feeling too heavy. I really enjoyed this one.  The Nutella hot chocolate was good, but something I could have easily made at home. The bacon was bacon. No complaints there :) The total came out to $27 ish dollars. I love affordable, so no complaints there either.   I won't write off Cafe Moulin just yet, but would probably go with something more unusual when picking another savory crepe to try.",

We only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated at a bar area near the door. At first I was disappointed not to have a table, but it worked out fine. The restaurant is below street level and has a very cozy feel to it. I had the Alaskan crepe and a cappuccino. Both were absolutely delicious. My niece ordered an iced coffee and unfortunately, it was luke warm and the ice melted before she was 1/4 of the way through. Other than the coffee problem, all three of us devoured our food and loved every bite of it. If I lived in the area it would be dangerous because I would want to eat there every weekend morning.",

The whipped cream was also dense with a deep, rich flavor.  This place is a great breakfast option in Shadyside.",

As a long-time customer of Crepes Parisiennes, I fully admit bias, but being tired of the shut-out at C.P. over holidays, I decided to try Cafe Moulin. Heck, I was thrilled to see that the \"crepe genre\" had been maintained despite the loss of C.P. in that spot.  I really like the do-over and being able to sit down and be served, but sadly, the Salmon crepe was fishy. The Cafe Au Lait was just coffee and milk. Of course I guess C.P.'s espresso based Cafe Au Lait is Pittsburgh's best anyway. I found it patronizing to have the meal explained to me. I wondered: if the owners _are_ perhaps French, I guess they think that Pittsburgh is the same as Bug Tussle  Alabama -- \"we done never had crepes befo'\" Whatever.  Having had crepes in Paris, I think Crepes Parisiennes is much closer to the mark. I'm sorry for that, because I am a customer and not a loyalist. I would like Pittsburgh to have another great crepery and I don't care who runs it.",

The cheesecake crepe was pretty thin (not much filling) and, although yummy, doesn't come with any sides.  If you're there for brunch and are hungry, you may be better off with one of the savory crepes as they seemed to be more full and, therefore, looked more filling.  The regular coffee was great so I didn't bother ordering an espresso (which I would normally jump at).  The wait staff was funny, welcoming and attentive but I think they needed another person to attend to the crowd.  Overall, I might go again if I wanted something light but not if I'm really hungry.",

    "text": "We went to Cafe Moulin last week for Brunch. The servers were polite, but they are VERY VERY understaffed. They probably need about double the help they currently have to serve tables. The table turn over time is very slow because they are understaffed, making the wait times pretty long. Also, once you have a table, it takes them a while to take your order, and they don't have time to check up on you to see if you need anything. At one point, we were without utensils for quite a while and couldn't eat our food. The food at Cafe Moulin is not bad. We had savory and sweet crepes. I was impressed by the sweet crepe, but not so much by the savory crepe. I have lived in Nancy, France, where I ate really delicious crepes. Also, the crepes in Philadelphia (where I lived for 4 years) were amazing (particularly at Pari Cafe Creperie). I would say the crepes at Cafe Moulin are not bad, but also not breath-taking. Due to the understaffing of the restaurant, I would probably not come back again for brunch on the weekend.",

    "text": "First off this is an awesome place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. A competitor to Pamela's and De Luca's that have ruled the breakfast and brunch scene in Pittsburgh for a while, hope Moulin gradually expands to seat more people, simply because of the quality of comfort food that comes out of their kitchen is amazing. I visited Cafe Moulin on a Sunday afternoon, still packed at 2:00pm. Needless to say they are tiny and in a basement but with a really nice quaint feeling to the place. They have a decent sized list of sweet and savory crepes and french toast. I tried the Marseille Crepe with eggs and fruit and the Classic French Toast both of which were delightful. The Marseille is a savory crepe with roasted chicken, swiss cheese, caramelized onions & harissa sauce. The spice of the sauce and beautifully cooked eggs complimented each other perfectly. The crepe itself was thin and light, letting the roasted chicken filling drive the flavor of the dish, served with a side of salad or fruit -  makes you want to go back for more. The Classic Toast is basically two slices of their special bread, soaked in egg batter & maple butter, served with whipped cream. It was battered to perfection and fried to melt as bite into it. Their home brewed organic coffee gives you a good start to an even better breakfast and brunch. I'd rate them a 4.5 over all. A must try if you're in the burgh.",

A quick chat with the owner revealed that he didn't even know that crepes are traditionally served with cider (note that I don't blame him for not serving alcohol). They use regular flour instead of buckwheat flour. The avocados in the Bristol crepe weren't ripe. The Alaskan crepe was OK. Positive notes: nice interior design and polite staff.",

Now for the waffle. Another reviewer said his waffle tasted stale or dry. Yes the waffle was dense, with a crispy exterior. Could it possibly be a little lighter? Sure, but I wasn't at all put off by it. And besides with the fresh berries, the airy whipped cream and the amazing Belgian chocolate, the density of the waffle is a welcome contrast of texture.  I'll be back with my family.",

    "text": "** Hip brunch spot with many choices for french toast and crepes. Smaller place that can have a wait on weekends.  I love brunch but I am not always a morning person, especially on the weekends. After a few failed attempts, I finally made it one weekend, and Im glad that I had the opportunity to eat here. I ordered the classic french toast and added strawberries ($9 total), which I think made it a lot better because the french toast by itself might have been a bit plain.   The pieces were really thick and decently filling. Typically I do not like to eat things that are overly sweet and more subtle in flavor, and the french toast here is kind of like that. I actually ended up using most if not all of of the whipped cream and syrup, which is typically rare for me.  I also ordered the Nutella Hot Chocolate Cappuccino which I didn't particularly like... I guess this one was a bit too plain and I was expecting it to be a bit sweeter or have more flare. Didn't think the drink was worth $2.50.    Not the cheapest place so I wouldn't eat here too often but its a nice experience overall and I would definitely be down to try one of the sweet crepes in the future.",

Banella Crepe (3/5): better than the Super Belgium, but still had way too much nutella spread on it.  Alaskan Crepe (3.5/5): very filling and decent smoked salmon crepe, but a little on the heavy side.  Overall I found the crepes to be average and a little pricey.",

When I think of crepes, I think of a sweet dessert so I've only had one savory crepe here - the Alaskan - but even that one daring switch to savory wasn't a bad try at all. I love their french toasts the most, though. They're as fluffy as can get and never too sweet. I've tried their regular french toast with added strawberries on top, and during my most recent visit I ordered the Amsterdam French Toast. It came with turkish sausages, two eggs and a side of maple syrup. It was the perfect mix of sweet and savory.   There's a rustic yet modern vibe to this little cafe. All the workers and servers are extremely friendly and always give the best service. They all seem like family, which makes me smile when I see their happy interactions in the business.",

The Omelette was filling but the turkey sausage was more spiced than I prefer. I was glad I added avocado to my Omelette. The side of fresh fruit was a nice touch. My friend ordered the Nutella Crepe. It is pretty and tastes sweet but she said it was too sweet (Nutella inside and on the outside). I recommended splitting the savory and sweet Crepe with a friend so you get the best of both worlds. :) Waitress was nice and patient when answering my questions. Rated a 4 out of 5 stars because it was pricey. My brunch, including tip was $21. I didn't realize they have a 10% off student discount until writing this review. Learn from my mistakes.",

I would like you to know that if you want a unique breakfast experience in a quaint little restaurant with amazing crepes, then you need to try this place! Keep it a secret though so that I can get a table without waiting in a long line next time I go here. My first time eating here was today and we were seated quickly as there was no line and only two of us. The place is small and the tables close, but I didn't mind (usually do) as the decor and ambiance was distracting in a good way. Our waiter was attentive and friendly allowing us to order quickly and get our lattes without to long a wait. Our Crepes followed shortly after and the ingredients/ preparations were spot on. Make sure to get the fall special for dessert. Not the cheapest option to eat at but definitely one of the better choices for a great breakfast experience in town. P.S. Don't tell anyone!

We usually bring our 10-month old son, and the staff is accommodating and sweet to him. It is kid-friendly without being a \"kid place,\" if you know what I mean. Also, we've started going regularly on Sunday mornings. It's a busy time (good for them!) and sometimes there is a wait. We've never actually had to wait, but seen people waiting. Probably not for too long, and it's worth it. I have to say the staff does a good job staying on the ball, keeping coffees warm and demeanors friendly even when very busy. It's just a great place.",

At other places, it's usually thin sliced luncheon meats which I think works better in this scenario. The side salad it comes with was fine, but not especially exciting. On the plus side, they have a couple of outdoor tables which work well on a pleasant day, and the interior has an appealing cozy ambience. The service was also prompt and friendly.",

I really couldn't understand why three crepes (one with strawberries, bananas, and Nutella; one with bananas and nutella; and one whose ingredients escape me but called for brie on the menu)  took so long to come out. How difficult it is to make a crepe? I'd imagine that the batter is pre-made and all you have to do is cook it and fill it. Our order took over 30 minutes. Not only was the service slow, but my sister's friend, specifically asked for no brie in his because he cannot have dairy products. Sure enough, it was in there and he had to continue to wait.  Once you get past the slow service, the food was quite good. I was glad that we stumbled across it, but it ate into the little time that I had left and did not allow for all the things that I had hoped to do before my flight left. *le sigh* C'est la vie...",

I have been there a couple of times already and like how they really took the time in every detail for decoration, even the center pieces. For me that tells a lot about a place. I really feel comfortable in that place. Let's  talk about the food. I tried their crepes and waffles. All of them prepared right in front of you, simply delicious. Fruits are fresh and the plate itself looks beautifully decorated.  One thing I love is that their tea are hand filled tea bags, Good Tea!! I strongly recommend this place!!! Not even mentioned the customer service. Everybody is really friendly and welcoming!!!! I love the food and the place!! thumbs up!!",

Anyway, this was my first time to Pittsburgh and I was going to go to Pamela's because I heard it's an institution here. However, they had a wait out the door and ain't nobody bout that life. So I walked around the corner and found this little gem. I am sat immediately because you always have princess VIP status when you're a party of one. I ultimately decided on the Ottawa crepe which is brie and eggs inside with bacon on top. I got fancy and decided to add raspberry compote on top. I HIGHLY recommend it that way. Otherwise, it may be a little average. The salty sweet combo is supreme. This place is cute. The wait staff is personable. I recommend it as a decent crepe place. When I come back to Pittsburgh, I probably will find a new spot. Not because it's bad but because I like to eat my way through cities one restaurant at a time. Definitely worth a try.",

    "text": "Crepes are one of the simplest foods to prepare. They are so simple to prepare that in many cities, particularly Paris, they are considered street food. A Jamon et fromage (ham and swiss) crepe in Paris costs 3.5 euros ($7) and takes between 2 and 3 minutes to prepare by a single person on a street corner.   This is why Cafe Moulin, whose crepes are adequate at best, is so frustrating:  they take 16 minutes to fill an order that should take less than 5.   And that's after it takes one of the 7 employees 20 minutes to clean a table for you.   I've been there three times and the same thing happened each time. This place is incompetent.   Cafe Moulin : the crepes are fine, nothing special. Only go if you like waiting for no reason.",

I actually didn't like the venue very much, as it seemed to be more favorable for a coffee shop rather than a restaurant.  Located in the bowels of a Walnut side street, it was small and quaint- which unfortunately doesn't bode well for the brunch crowd.  It was way too crowded, and I ended up sitting right by the door that people kept opening and shutting and it was unbearably cold.  The food was average to above average for brunch, and the service was so-so.  I was a bit disappointed with my experience but would consider stopping in again.",

The choices are very good and tasty (even though mainly towards the heavy, unhealthy but delicious side).  However, the main drawback of this place is the service.  I understand that it is very busy at times but it is extraordinarily inefficient.  Even though when there are plenty of tables open it seems that it takes forever to get seated. I am not sure whether it is a policy of the owner in order to appear as there is a line and creating the physiological effect on potential customers that this place must be nice but it is something that can turn customers away. Overall I think I will give it again another chance but maybe not during rush hours.",

The menu does seem to be slightly limited for brunch - it's mostly known for their french toasts, crepes, and omelettes. But I love how each one tastes! I admit their sausage is very salty but the toast balances it out very well. I love how their french toast isn't overly sweet, and if you get the nutella crepe - the amount of nutella is very generous.   I think that the portion seems a little small for its price, but it definitely still fills me up until my next meal. I suggest going with a friend if you're in the area! The environment is very homey and warm - perfect for a nice conversation to catch up with a loved one!",

We actually had a tattoo, metal studded, tiny French girl wait on us which gave us the vibe we were assuming. She then went on to give us our specials for the day. We enjoyed some amazing house handcrafted brew and juice while waiting for our food. Our food of choice included savory and sweet crepes of the best kind. Freshly made in house to order my favorite over and over again will have to be the salmon goat cheese crepe. Still remember that taste in my mouth. If you're not into the fish or savory crepes, please go with the traditional sweet and enjoy the Nutella or Berry or really anything on the menu because it was all amazing... Can't go wrong.

The healthy yogurt breakfast parfait was really delicious although there was less yogurt and more granola. Fruit was all fresh which is a nice change from others who usually pile on smushy and old fruits into parfaits! Overall good vibes - would come again.",

You can get regular breakfast/brunch dishes such as omelet or french toast, but it's not your regular breakfast/brunch thanks to the Turkish tweaks. The Turkish crepe is unique and delicious: the Sofia I ordered came with a tasty spicy-flavored crepe. I'm determined to try different flavors in the near future.  Service is okay maybe slightly understaffed on weekends, similar to many over-crowded brunch spots across the country.",

Next time I think I'll try one of their sweet or savory crepes.   A note if you've never been it is right next to walnut street so parking can be rough",

    "text": "My favorite brunch place in Shadyside especially when im craving delicious coffee and crepes. Cafe Moulin is such an appropriate name for this quaint little cafe which will transport you to Paris when you step inside. Tucked away in a corner, this was my go-to brunch place for every other Sunday this past winter.  My favorite go-to entree is the Super Belgium with a side of turkish sausage. The crepe is filled with cookie butter and topped with bananas, strawberries and chocolate sauce. The sausage provides the much needed savoriness which lacks in the sweet crepe. Sooo yum!  My friend once got the salmon crepe and i tasted it and it was also delicious especially if you are looking for a light and savory option. My friends also love their paninis especially the ones with the harissa aioli.   P.s: Dont forget to try one of their coffee drinks but seriously their black coffee is the best. I always get so sad days when i miss their daily brewed coffee (they usually stop brewing an hour before closing on weekdays). The cappuccino is good too but nothing beats their coffee. Must try!",

You can tell they treat their employees well as they all seem to be very happy and content with their work. This also shows through in their dishes as they were all very fresh and cooked to perfection! I have absolutely no complaints about their food! I have the walnut street French toast with a side of eggs and bacon. The French toast was fantastic! Even those in my party who had plain French toast mentioned it was the best French toast they've had, however I did not just have plain French toast, mine was topped with some delicious sauce which I cannot completely explain other then it being creamy and delightful, topped with oats and walnuts and other granola ingredients. Their eggs were cooked nice whether you choose to have them dippy or scrambled they are light and airy, their bacon was cooked very well however next time I will be choosing their Turkish sausage as I tried that and it was flavor packed! Their billing is nice and convenient especially for those wishing to \"split the bill\" I left this restaurant highly satisfied and full! I have not been this happy with a restraunt experience in a long time and I'm very grateful for my experience here! Please make a reservation if coming during peak hours as they do get busy! But don't let that deter you as this is simply an amazing place to dine!",

    "text": "I guess I'm not a fan of Cafe Moulin but am torn between 2 and 3 stars..... I don't like going there, but I know others don't hate it....Okay so I guess I'll make a pros and cons list:  PROS:  -Nice atmosphere (aesthetically appealing and clean). -Food is consistent. -Coffee is great.  CONS: -Usually a very long wait time. You'll wait to get seated and you'll wait to get food.  -Very small restaurant with limited seating. -The food is average. I've never had anything \"bad\" but I haven't had anything that was really good either. I've had different crepes and they're all pretty basic and average tasting. I finish my plate, but am usually underwhelmed.  -The service can be bad. Not just bad because they're slow, which isn't always their fault, but bad as in rude and sometimes they seem agitated. I've had some pleasant interactions, but generally they are very curt and don't seem to care that much about how they interact. Example: A server didn't bring me an item I ordered when other drinks were brought to the table. I flagged him and politely asked for my item, and was told that he \"knows and it's coming.\" And then there was this ::eyeroll:: and it just describes the service you can expect to get every once and a while at Cafe Moulin.  If you want crepes and Cafe Moulin isn't busy, you can try their crepes without fear of food poisoning or being dramatically disappointed. If it's busy, I would consider waiting in line elsewhere.",

    "text": "Let me be as constructive as possible.   First the good: I think that they did a great job with their renovations. When Crepes Parisiennes had the spot it was sort of... dingy. The restaurant looks great, with nice stonework and a kind of owl theme going on.  Another nice feature of this restaurant is that it is excellent at not being Pamela's. I've never really gotten the fuss over Pamela's and the lines seem to rival those at the Apple store. I was seated promptly.  Other things done right: service was prompt and friendly, and the coffee was good.  Now to the heart of the review: the food. Between myself and my dining companion we tried three dishes, the \"Black and Rose\" waffle, \"the Ottawa\", and the spinach, feta and goat cheese crepe. The spinach crepe was acceptable, but the waffle was bad, and the Ottawa was an affront to my Canadian heritage.  The waffle was topped with chocolate, blackberries, and raspberries. The waffle itself was either stale or had a really dry dough--in my opinion vastly inferior to the waffles at either Waffallonia or either of the Brug(g)e(s).  The Ottawa was a leathery crepe wrapped around unseasoned eggs. It was accompanied by a fruit salad that looked suspiciously canned, and cold bacon that I would have been disappointed to see emerge from my microwave on a paper towel. I left most of my meal which is, frankly, surprising because I am a long time member in the illustrious \"Clean Plate Club\".  In summary, the food was bad enough that I will not return unless major changes are made.",

    "text": "Cute shop in Lawrenceville. My fiancee and I were looking for a tasty quick brunch before we went off to the grocery store (never shop on an empty stomach!)... and Yelp shows us the way! It is a small cafe on the first floor of the building but offers plenty of seating! We didn't have to wait since we were okay with sitting at the bar next to the kitchen. It was fun watching (read: learning) how they make their crepes and french toast! We ordered a vanilla latte and a cappuccino which arrived hot and delicious! We sipped on these as we waited for our food, which wasn't long. I ordered the French Toast with strawberries and a side of two eggs and my fiancee the Spinach Tomato Mozzarella crepe (you know, for the sweet and salty approach we always take!). Both were perfect! My fiancee almost forgot we were splitting and finished 90% of the crepe... so thankfully I still tried it. Fluffy, delicious, flavorful! The french toast bread was amazing and the coating was cooked perfectly! Yum! Can't wait to go back!",

I had the Bristol crepes and appreciated that they came with a bit of greens and fruit. Mack had the Turkish coffee which isn't something you see everywhere and enjoyed it as well. His crepes were satisfactory, too. Our server was incredibly personable and kind and it made our good experience awesome. I don't recall his name but he was great. The ambiance here is also nice, between the decor and music I was pretty much sold! We'll be back! It's nice to have an alternative to Pamela's in Shadyside.",

    "text": "Cafe Moulin is my favorite breakfast place in Shadyside. You walk down the steps into cute substreet level dining area with a space that can seat about 30 people. The setting is warm and open with plenty of natural sunlight shining into room and warm lightly colored wood floor.  Quickly one of the bohemian waiters asks for you drinks and give you what I call an amazing menu. One side will have sweet crepes, from nutella, banana and fresh strawberries, where as the other side will have the savory flavors. Being a savory girl myself there is plenty of variety to choose from. Be warned, these are large and creamy. Most will have a sauce of sorts whether the herb creme spread of alaskan crepe or the bechamel that drenches the Bristol. Your tongue will have plenty to taste. Having been here 3 times, I have enjoyed each of my choices and always left plenty full. When you need to break it up you much on the side salad that home with a house dressing. All very delicious.  Now to my favorite part of Cafe Moulin. They will do a Turkish Coffee fortune reading for you with the purchase of your coffee. Turkish coffee is brewed thick and grainy and sweetened for you. They will ask for light, medium or heavy sweet flavoring. You get it in a small 8 oz cup where you sip, sip, sip until only the bottom coffee granularity remains. Now, you quickly flip over you cup and wait for the grains to make their way down your cup. Depending on your personality and the spread at which you sip your coffee, the cup and therefore the grains will be a different temperature and therefore either make it down your cup more quickly or less quickly.   The girl will come over when you have waited the appropriate amount of time and will \"read your fortune\" .... I love having my fortune read. The girl is obviously not an expert and knows this cute party trick for her own fun, but either way, it's still pretty neat and a perk to your food.  Will come often again.",

Especially the server Nursu is always there with her cheerful smile to help you with your choices. I came here to have continental breakfast and ordered Sophia crepe and french toasts. Everything i ate was amazing. I really loved every single one. French toast and the fruits are very fresh and tasted so good.I also liked the combination of turkish sausage and eggs in the crepe.Beside the breakfast i also ordered cafe latte. I loved it  all as much as i loved the portion size! I strongly recommend this place to the people who like French based European food or just want to try something different in Pittsburgh .I'm looking forward to come back !",

They were so full of flavor and we'd return for the tea alone.  We ordered the otowa crepe and the Bristol crepe (added egg) and both were fantastic.  The fruit on my plate was very fresh and delicious also.  Service was fast, and attentive despite how busy they were.  I have zero complaints about this place and can't wait to return!",

    "text": "Well I was excited about visiting this cafe, considering how cute and tucked away it is. After walking down into the cafe, I wasn't greeted by anyone. That's fine sometimes during busy times anywhere someone can be overlooked.   I proceeded to walk around as it's rather small, just to see if I could set up my computer. I'm a freelance contract worker so it's usually pretty important to me that I be able to work and enjoy the restaurant. I'd already saw that there was Xfinity wifi available, so the only other thing I needed was an outlet. Since no one still had greeted or tried to engage me to help, I looked around. I made contact with a younger woman with an apron on, signaling to me she worked there, but after she didn't speak or rely to my southern head nod, I moved on. After finding an outlet I turned around to find help and understand seating. I saw someone set a table so I knew there had to be a host somewhere. Before I could, that same young woman who passed on saying hello or trying to help earlier, decide to speak after all. She asked where I was going, and I explained to her that I was just checking on available outlets and wifi to see if this would be a place where I could work and eat. Instead of helping she made the snarky comment that I couldn't sit there, although I wasn't sitting anywhere, and that there's a host and I needed to find him and wait for him to find me a seat.   I decided then that this wasn't the type of environment for me, so I let her know that she didn't answer my question or concerns about outlets and wifi and based off her unwelcoming demeanor and disregard to talk with me, I'd just find somewhere else. And I did right down the street. I was disappointed because it was such a charming place with a seemingly awesome menu, but I still believe quality customer service is important. All I could do was hope that race had nothing to do with how cold and rude she was.   Maybe another time it'll work it, I'll ask a friend to let me know.",

It took 15 min to get our lattes, my friend ordered a coffee and got a latte, asked for a coffee again (not drinking the latte) and was charged for a latter not a coffee.   The female waitress wasn't friendly at all. It seemed as though it was only her waiting tables whilst a gentlemen was seating people (he was friendly).   Although the food was great, I won't return because of the bad service. I mean even though my taste buds were happy, waiting 30 min for waffles while hungry is just ridiculous.",

    "text": "This is be second time that I've ate here, and both times I was really pleased. I've gotten the Alaskan Crepe with smoked salmon and creme cheese and while I've never had a crepe (or at least a real crepe that didn't come from be frozen food section), if this is an indication of how a crepe should be, then I'm a fan. The savory crepes like mine come with a small, spring mix salad with a light oil dressing. The meal was light but left me satisfied while out and about.       I took my mom out for a late lunch and she had an egg crepe. She added bacon and a side of avocado. She only ate half, so I of course willingly finished it. The egg was done perfectly. I believe there was Brie in there which added a nice creaminess, and the bacon added that hint of salt that really made it for me.      Lastly we split a dessert crepe, it had maple syrup, walnuts, creamy cheese inside, and a side of whip cream. The waitress suggested strawberries and it was a good call. They were fresh and added a nice, clean taste to the dish. I definitely hope to stop back soon. The only real negative is that the place is a bit small. It's not a place I'd hit if you're in a decently sized group.",

Cafe Moulin is a bit on the pricier side, but when you're the only crepe joint in town you probably can get away with that. The portion sizes are pretty underwhelming for the price - I'm not someone that likes to feel disgustingly full after a meal, so that's okay, but I do wish the crepes were priced a bit lower. Definitely not the best crepes I've ever had, but something different for brunch than your standard diner food.  I'm not dying to go back but if a friend wanted to, I'd return.",

    "text": "I stopped into Cafe Moulin for lunch with my parents earlier today.  I was hoping for a quick and light lunch, and having read some of the other reviews, was concerned that the quick part might not happen.  My fears were confirmed when we walked in and, after getting a waitress's attention after standing in the front for five minutes, were told that the wait would be 25 min.  I asked my parents if they wanted to go somewhere else nearby, but they wanted to wait it out.  I think we waited about 20 min. to be seated, but even a wait of that length wasn't necessary, given that several tables sat vacant for part of the wait.  Also, despite keeping a list, the waitstaff couldn't keep the order of arrival straight, such that we the customers had to remind them of who had been waiting longest.  Once we finally were seated, service wasn't the most efficient, either.  For our entrees, my mom ordered the Halle Berry crepe (strawberries, Nutella, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream; $8.35), my dad ordered the Bristol crepe (smoked turkey, goat cheese, avocado, and bechamel; $9.50), and I ordered the Alaskan crepe (smoked salmon, herbed cream cheese, and spinach; $10.50).  Both savory crepes came with a small side salad, which was a nice accompaniment.  While the quality was alright, it wasn't anything to write home about.  While my parents enjoyed their crepes, they didn't rave about them, so I think we were on the same page there.  Overall, I wasn't overly impressed with my experience at Cafe Moulin, particularly in terms of the service.  It took us an hour and a half from the time of arrival to the time that we left, which is just too much time for lunch.  While I get that they're busy, it's clear that the management needs to do a better job of providing organized and prompt customer service.  Quite frankly, if it were up to me, I wouldn't have stuck around--I would have simply gone up the street to grab lunch elsewhere.  As it were, I doubt I'll return, given that I live two blocks away from Crepes Parisiennes, which is higher quality, cheaper, and quicker--not to mention closer--to boot.",
