We had the Brussels sprouts and crab bisque as an appetizer, and Cajun Salmon and Meatloaf for our main course.  Great portions and amazing flavors.  To top it off the service is inviting, friendly, and funny.  To top that off the space is elegantly designed which made for a very comfortable dining experience.  We will for sure be back. Do yourself a favor and check this place out!!",

Most disapointing  was owner not there.Don't think most of customers there won' be coming back.I think concept would have been very successful if owner gave a darn.",

I am not entirely sure how to describe it. I feel like everything I ate was cooked by someone who hadn't made it before, if that makes sense. Nothing had flavor or pizzazz. I think I tasted a hint of smoke in the mac and cheese but can't say for certain as it was entirely fleeting. From the underdone hushpuppies to the mundane five slices of green tomato, nothing popped and it all fizzled. The chicken and waffles was handbreaded, flavorless chicken cutlets. I have never encountered this before and pray I dont again. That isn't chicken and waffles. It was like whoever cooked it had only ever read about it in a book. I couldn't run out of their fast enough. Hopefully they are figuring it out and can break the Del's curse, but I won't be back to find out. The staff was super nice so two stars for all yinz hardworking and smiling people.",

Our problems were similar to everyone else's...clueless service, mistakes on what we ordered and when it came out, long wait times, mediocre food, and just an overall bad experience. The brisket wasn't bad, nor was the burger. The sauces left much to be desired, one is just peppered ketchup and the white sauce tasted bottled too. The sides were reminiscent of \"school cafeteria\" offerings. We were told immediately upon sitting at 630 that the kitchen was already 45 min behind. With the number of quality options in this city nowadays, you cannot continue with these issues for very long and survive. We certainly wish these folks the best of luck, but we won't be back!",

After our arrival we were going to just ordered takeout there but we decided to get a table in stead.Our waiter took our orders,we ordered starter in which were brought to our table in a pretty timely manner and the appetizers were good,but after over a 45 minute wait for our main course meals never came.We talked to the manager and told him the issue he did apologize for the extremely long wait time and said he would look into the delay and would talk to our server in which 45 minutes earlier told us that our food would out in a minute in which 45 minutes later and no food so at this point we got discussed and asked for the check.So after several more minutes of wait time the server came to our table a gave us our check a not a real apology or a effort to make it right he just blamed the issue on the cook & kitchen staff.This was our first time patronizing this business in hopes to maybe return back with family and friends but I don't think it's going to happen.Oh yeah just to mention,a couple came in and got seated while we were eating our appetizers and they got their food before we did in which we did bring to the managers attention (not cool)So we left there feeling disappointed.The may be good? but the service sucks and to us they don't seem to care.Advice: your food may be good but it doesn't matter if the service is bad,unfortunately we never got the chance to taste the main course.",

Neither the website nor the person who took our reservation let us know it would be a buffet. The menu: cheese eggs, grits, breakfast potatoes, vegetable lasagna (?), macaroni and \"cheese,\" waffle bar, biscuits and gravy, and Bloody Mary bar. The \"brunch\" buffet did not have any breakfast meat. We complained. They brought smoked chicken to our table, it was actually good. While we were leaving, we noticed that they managed to cook some bacon and put it on the buffet after we complained. This would have been just okay if they didn't respond so negatively towards our feedback, which they requested. One representative tried to defend the surprise buffet format by saying it was on Facebook. None of us are avid Facebook users anymore. Furthermore, if the surprise was a good brunch buffet, no one would care. But if it's a bad buffet surprise, there's no defending food we can taste for ourselves. They should have just taken the feedback and endeavored to improve moving forward.",

We arrived around 6pm, before any dinner rush and did not have a reservation. Luckily, the bar and high tops were available. That was great, since we had 4 in our party. The bartender was our server and was courteous, patient, and engaged. Once the food arrived, I enjoyed the chicken and waffles, however, be warned that they used bone-in chicken wings. I would have much preferred one fried breast. Otherwise, everyone enjoyed the meals, including the hot chicken sandwich and Cajun salmon. I can agree the portions aren't \"cheesecake factory\" size, but those are not a fair baseline. I look forward to returning, next time maybe snagging a reservation to sit in the dining room. My recommendation: give this place a shot and support up-and-coming businesses!",

I chose a quiet Tuesday happy hour to try food and drinks with friends. It was clear that training of staff at the bar was still in process and not being in a hurry I was fine with having drinks and patiently waiting for food. BBQ in pittsburgh is becoming a dime a dozen trend. I have criteria for what I enjoy. Staff is pleasant and engaging. The space is definitely different with a lounge area in the back with separate bar service and a downstairs for live music. As far as food... The best brisket I have had in pittsburgh. Hands Down. Moist. Smoky. Flavorful and a crust that makes you want to eat the fatty parts even thigh you know you shouldn't. Send criteria. Mac and cheese. Wow. Not sauce and cheese but task Mac and cheese and not dry ass.

Because it was lunch, we each had the She Crab Bisque and a side. My sis had cornbread and I had the mac and cheese. The bisque was delicious, creamy, a little smoky, and wonderfully tangy. The mac was very good with a delicate cheese and bacon flavor.--not covered in sauce. The menu is so tempting and we plan to return with friends for the chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits!

My meatloaf was burned on the underside, light on the gravy, and drink refills, including water , was slow.  I was hoping for more southern style menu. The greens were mostly stems and too many large chunks of ham. Cornbread had a funny color to it, not sure if it was overcooked or that was the recipe. I didn't care for the fried green tomatoes, they were warm and not crisp. The brisket was very good, and on my second visit they had the beignets, they were good but I asked for choc. and caramel syrup to be on the side and it was brought to table with them drizzled over the beignets. French fries are very good.",

Not only was the service great , the food was amazing ! I had the Cajun salmon and it was seasoned to perfection. Every meal that came out (which was eight) were all hot and fresh. I would recommend anyone to go it's not a big menu but literally everything on the menu is great. After my experience I went on their website and set up a reservation for me and my boyfriend to go next weekend.",

After a few minutes we asked if there any chance of being seated and she suggested a high top by the bar.  The waiter came by and asked if we wanted drinks, I asked what a sazarec was and he told me it was a hallucinogen , so I passed.  Had a French 75 and it was delicious.  All of our was great- Cajun crab fritters, hot chicken sandwich , Mac and cheese and shrimp and grits.  No of this was disappointing.  We never saw our waiter after he took our order and had to order beignets (they were yummy) and get our to go boxes and check from the bartender.  She was the best !!  Hopefully going back for some more good food, hope the wait staff has changed by then. And because of them, they only get 4 stars.",

We waited 10 minutes and no one came to our table so we went to the bar for our drinks. Service was slow. There's plenty of help just no one doing anything. Now for the food...it was delicious!  Brisket, meatloaf, sandwiches, greens, hush puppies and desserts were excellent. I'm only giving two stars because the service was that bad. Bad service ruins a meal. I hope the service improves because that can kill a restaurant, and it would be a shame for a restaurant this good to close due to bad service. We will definitely go back because the food is great - hopefully the service improves by then.",

They constantly forgot drinks. When the food came it was horrific. 1) the soup was cold 2) they mixed up the po'boy sandwich and even so it had very little meat on it 3) my chicken was RAW! To be fair, on a scale of 1-10 it was a 6.5 in terms of done-ness. But I don't want medium chicken!! It was an all around hot mess. Please do better! I love Cajun food and Pittsburgh desperately needs a Cajun restaurant.",

    "text": "My husband and I dined here Saturday night, we arrived at 6:00 without reservations, the host asked if we would mind sitting at a high top table , we replied \"of course not\" as we were looking forward to eating here. Our waitress was also the bartender, no problem there, however she must have been either; very new (did not know what type of meat was in the greens) or simply did not want to serve us, as she was short with us and did not bother to check on us through out the experience. Mind you there were 2 people sitting at the bar and 3 tables in the dining area, so she could not have been that busy. Our appetizer (cajun hushpuppies)  took almost 25 minutes to arrive, and our meal ( steak and brisket) took an additional hour, and was most certainly not worth the wait.  I ordered the brisket, and was very disappointed, it was flavorless and not tender, I had to use my husbands steak knife to cut it since it was served in almost 1 inch thick slices, it came with white BBQ sauce that was also lacking in flavor as was the mac n cheese and garlic potatoes (these looked like they were covered in paste).  Other than leaving , the best part of the meal was the cajun hushpuppies, the remoulade sauce was great that accompanied them. I have never left less than 20% on a check however this time I did, we will not return for flavorless food , and poorly trained servers again.",

And forgetful. - She forgot the gumbo. And forgot a second beer.  - Everything took FOREVER... Even drinks - which were only sangria and beer. We even had to ask the hostess to find our server and get our check after trying to wait patiently for 15 minutes.  - The fried green tomatoes came quickly and were decent. - There were no collard greens at 6:45 on  Saturday night, when the restaurant was largely empty. How is that possible for a restaurant claiming to be both southern & bbq? Collards are neccessary!! Not on this night.  - The only things we ordered that needed to be cooked \"fresh\" were our sides - fries & grilled vegetables. BBQ should be done ahead... low and slow cooked to fall apart... and just need a quick reheat. And yet it took at least 25 minutes after our appetizer was eaten...  - The pulled pork was good. Easily the best thing we ate.  - The mac and cheese was cold and severely unseasoned.  - The brisket was bone dry. Extremely tough. And largely inedible.  In summary... if \"smoke\" is in your name, bbq is in your description and brisket is a mainstay on the menu... you might want to find a new pit master if you want to stay open. Sorry guys... but serious improvements are needed!!",

The staff were immediately friendly and attentive, and we were seated quickly. Our server Shawn introduced himself, which is missing at other places sometimes, and he explained the menu to us with enthusiasm.   My husband & I shared the fried green tomatoes, and they were tasty. They came with a sort of dijonnaise dipping sauce, which was fun. Then to start, he had the crab bisque and I had the vegan gumbo. Wow! They were both fantastic. You can add crab to the gumbo, which I'm sure is great, but it stood fine on its own. Good spice. For mains, I got the Shrimp & Grits and he got the Brisket with Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese. More deliciousness! My husband said the Brisket just melted in his mouth, and I tasted his Mac & Cheese- nice and gooey. To my delight, the grits were actually cheese grits, which i love. There was no skimping on shrimp, and they were cooked perfectly, not rubbery. It was the first time I'd had this dish with a spicy red sauce, and it was terrific. The portions are generous, so we unfortunately didn't have room for dessert, but we will be back.   The house manager Gary was right there on a Saturday night, checking on us to make sure we were having a good meal and experience. I bbn highly recommend Sugar and Smoke!",

    "text": "I want to be very careful about how to word this review. I will state at the outset that I very much want this restaurant (which has only been open for about 3 months) to do well. It has a nice backstory - native Pittsburgher with a passion for Southern cuisine reinvents a former Bloomfield landmark (Del's Restaurant - which I only remember from watching an episode of \"Restaurant Impossible\" a few years back). I know first hand that the head chef can cook. I attended an event several weeks ago on the South Side which the restaurant catered and all of the food was marvelous - delicious pulled pork, brisket, smoked salmon, collared greens, and mac n' cheese. It was very evident from the smile on the chef's face and the quality of the food that he loved to cook and took great pride his cuisine. My recent dining experience left me wondering whether that guy might have taken the night off. Or, more concerning, whether this restaurant is classic case of an owner and chef who know how to make good food but have no idea how to run a brick and mortar restaurant.  My evening started out strangely enough with the bartender unable to make one of the eight or so \"signature\" cocktails on the menu (Streetcar Named Desire) because they were out of peach schnapps (weird, but I was willing to give them a pass on this one). Things went quickly downhill from there. We dined rather late (8:30 PM), and were advised that the restaurant was out of several items (fried green tomatoes, brisket, and meatloaf) on what was an already fairly limited menu. Our appetizer came pretty quickly (brussel sprouts, which were just OK), but it then literally took 1 1/2 hours for our entrees to follow (the table next to us suffered the same fate, and actually cheered when their food arrived). One of the entrees (a simple grilled NY strip), was so overcooked that it was inedible, and one of our diners never received his entree (a hamburger - which, by the way, he knew in advance was going to be missing one of the key ingredients - the brisket!). My shrimp and grits should have been renamed \"grits and shrimp\" because it had precisely four shrimp in the dish.  Our poor waitress was very apologetic throughout the evening, and did her best to cover for what was obviously either an understaffed or inexperienced (perhaps inept?) kitchen. To make matters worse, the manager of the restaurant never came to our table to apologize for the train wreck that our evening had become. The coup de grace was when the bill came - the restaurant automatically added a 20% tip to the bill (which I paid, so as to not penalize the waitress who had nothing to do with our bad experience).  So, will I ever return? Definitely not until the owner and head chef have significantly more time to either work out the kinks or decide if perhaps they are better off going into the catering business.",

Then, the collared greens tasted like I'd swallowed a bottle of black pepper. My mouth was on fire. In a bad way. This place has potential but please, please learn how to season food. And I'll say that I'm a frequent bbq eater in Texas, Alabama, and Carolina, so this isn't borne of ignorance. $21 for awfully seasoned bbq is not a good thing.",

    "text": "I usually never pass judgment on a new restaurant, as I am very aware of the many kinks that need to be worked out. We had reservations for a table for four at 6:30 Saturday evening. We parked the car and went into the restaurant and were feeling good about the energy and look of the restaurant. We checked in with the host/hostess and made them aware of our arrival (15 minutes early). We went to the bar and ordered drinks. throughout the time, the hostess continuously kept checking with us, explaining that our table would be ready soon, as they has some stragglers, that should be leaving soon. We finally got the good news that our table was ready (yay, or so we thought). We waited and waited and waited and still no server?? We continuously kept looking at the other tables and made comments to each other that no table had any food (not one table had food). So, we waited and waited and waited, watching other tables go up and complain. Finally we decided to get up and leave. On my way out, I quietly said to the host \"we are going to leave since there was no service \" at which point he said to me, with a smile \"ok\". My friends want to give them another try, me, not so much. I give this place a very short life expectancy. Being in the Food and Beverage industry for over 30 years myself, my one word of advice would be to hire a strong General Manager ( did not see anyone taking control of this situation). Sorry for the poor review!!!.",

    "text": "How difficult is it to have enough green tomatoes on hand that you don't run out of fried green tomatoes only an hour after opening?  Ridiculous.  And for a place called Sugar and Smoke, there was nary a smoked item on the menu.  The brisket hash had fairly sizable chunks of brisket, but they were not as tender as they should have been, a sign that the brisket was pulled before it hit peak temp, and there was no smoke flavor whatsoever, no crust, and no smoke ring.  The brisket was an unappealing uniformly gray color, average tasting at best, and seemed to have been cooked sous vide or in a slow cooker rather than in a smoker, and lacking the tenderness you would expect.  Please, if you're going to mislead your patrons with Smoke in your name, then at least give us something smoked to choose from.  I don't think it's a stretch to assume that when you order a brisket hash at a place called Sugar and Smoke, the brisket is going to be of the smoked variety. Nope.  Guy next to us ordered the brisket hash also, but he didn't get the over easy eggs that came atop of ours.  Time to train the kitchen staff.    Brunch menu was very limited and pretty much entirely devoid of smoked meat.  I ordered the catfish which, while perfectly tender and juicy, came at the center of a lonely plate with a couple sprinkles of parsley and a few thin strands of pickled jalapeno.  A medium sized piece of cheap fish should come with some kind of small side, no?  Or is that asking too much? I was thankful I had added a side of mac and cheese, which was actually also quite tasty, creamy,  and nicely charred on top, but it should have been included, not an add on.  Bloody Mary was weak and devoid of horseradish, which of course, they didn't have.  Oddly, they tried to recommend a mango bloody mary to us.  We all looked at each other like, my god, who would do that to a bloody mary?  Even more weirdly, after we were done, the bartender came over and offered my wife a micro teaspoon sized taste of, not the mango bloody mary itself, but little bits of mango mixed with seasoning, which was presumably used to make the mango bloody marys.  Why offer us a taste of ingredients?  Wouldn't it make more sense to offer us a chance to sample the actual full concoction itself, rather that one of its component parts?  It didn't taste good and only served to reinforce our belief that mango would NOT be something that should EVER be added to a bloody mary.  But horseradish, yes, that should be fixed. Just really beyond weird.  Whoever is running this place seems to have very little experience in restaurant management.    This place needs work.  I'm not sure what they want to be.  Looks like they are trying to be high end with decor and pricing, but I would assume from the name they also want to be a barbeque joint?  Sure doesn't seem like they are trying too hard on the latter.  Where is the smoke???    Probably won't return.  Plenty of great places to eat in the burgh.",

My husband had to ask the host for our server to come to our table. Got there at 7:30 and didn't leave until close at 10. That's how long dinner took. I will say the fried green tomatoes were good. She crab soup tasty. I did not think the hot chicken sandwich was great. It was a few chicken tenders with hot sauce on them on a bun. And I also prefer creamer Mac and cheese.

I haven't been in that location since Del's was there. Love the decor/color scheme, etc. the VIP area is lovely. Would definitely consider a birthday party or other event there!!   Admittedly, service was slow. We discovered this was because their computer system was down. Bummer it happened on opening day. I do wish our server knew a bit more about the food. Drinks came bubbling with dry ice - v exciting and Boomerang-able!  After sweating all day at the Pitt game, our table was a bit grumpy but that tune changed when the food came. EVERYONE enjoyed their main dish. However, I didn't love the shrimp and grits. It was spicier than I prefer. The peach cobbler could use a crust- that's the best part!!  They used a flaky phyllo dough here. A different take for sure :)  All in all, I am excited to go back and support. I truly believe they can do really well here and I'm looking forward to their success!!",

    "text": "Looking for a Saturday Brunch, and also wanting to have tried \"Sugar & Smoke\" since it opened, we ended up there for a lunch (though i got OJ and Coffee with my meal as it'd been a slow morning) we both loved yesterday.   After being greeted by a very nice host and being lead to our table, our waiter, Tory, soon came over and introduced himself as he poured our water.  He highlighted a few menu items--the brussel sprouts, She Crab Bisque as well as the Brisket and Pulled Pork--as his favorites and gave us a few minutes to decide.  He came back a little while later and we placed our order.  The Cajun Hush Puppies to start and then the Chicken & Waffles for my girlfriend and the Shrimp and Grits for me.  Throughout the meal our service was exemplary. TheCajun Hush Puppies were excellent, not too hot to grab off the plate and dip but i felt they could have been a smidge warmer and used a little bit more cajun heat.  I still highly recommend them though.  The real stars of our meal were our main courses though.  My girlfriend's Chicken and Waffles was among the best we've had in this city, drawing loads of praise and satisfied noises from each of us as we ate.  My Shrimp and Grits was excellent as well; I thoroughly enjoyed the slight spice kick in the red sauce and really felt the meal was grits done right.  I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for excellently done grits and \"Sugar and Smoke\"'s are just that.  I just found it peculiar \"no cheddar\" was marked below them on our bill. Was the dish supposed to come with cheddar (which isn't listed on the menu)?\"  Not a complaint by any means; just curious.   Sugar and Smoke comes strongly recommended. We recommended it to friends all weekend and will be back!",

No but it was good. Collard greens were good, and the cornbread was solid. Veggie gumbo was amazing and would definitely get that again as well as the veggie hush puppies. They had local cider from Arsenal which was wonderful. Overall a good experience.

After enthusiastically asking for a table, we were told they couldn't accommodate our party of two. Okay, it's possible - maybe they had 15 reservations for 6:45, who knows. We asked if we could sit at the bar and were told we could, but they won't serve the full menu there, only appetizers. No explanation, no warmth, no attempt to figure out a compromise. (For comparison, we ate at Cure recently; they told us they had a reservation for two bar seats in one hour, but if we wanted to have them until then, we were welcome to them. We had a wonderful - albeit brief - dinner and very happily went back a few weeks later for the full experience.)  We turned and left.  The restaurant looked nice enough, which is why it's getting 2 stars instead of one, but we won't be going back. That was one of the most inhospitable restaurants I've tried to visit.",

    "text": "We were really excited to try this place out as both the drink and dinner menus looked fantastic. Unfortunately our experience was less so.   On the plus: We arrived a little early for our 7:30 reservation, but we were kindly seated right away. We ordered old fashioneds to start and the charred brussel sprouts as an appetizer. Both the drinks and the brussels were great, although I thought the portion was small for an appetizer to be split between 2. You would certainly need to order multiples for more than 2 people. I had the shrimp and grits with cheddar, and they were excellent. We also ordered beignets for dessert. As with the appetizer, they were great, but a very small portion.   On the negative: Everything seemed to take an extremely long time (except for the appetizer, which came out very promptly). Our waitress was extremely kind and did apologize for the wait, although I got the impression that this is the current standard. I had ordered the collard greens as a side, but they were out of them--a disappoint for a self-proclaimed soul food restaurant, especially at a relatively early point in the evening. Opted for the cornbread instead; it was so-so. My fiance ordered the bone-in ribeye \"rare to medium rare, more on the rare side.\" When it arrived, he cut into it and there was barely any pink. Given the wait time and the price point, this was probably our biggest upset with this restaurant.   It seems they have only been open a couple months, so I'm thinking they are still working out some kinks. Will give it another go in 6 months-a year once they have their footing. In the meantime, don't go there when you're too hungry since you'll have a bit of a wait, and don't order steak.",

The grilled shrimp appetizer was AWESOME, the chicken and waffles were amazeballs and the meatloaf came with really good BBQ sauce that I could probably eat on everything. Speaking of which, there was another yelp review hating on the BBQ sauce because it tasted like ketchup...did you know that BBQ sauce has ketchup in it? Some would even go as far as saying it's a type of ketchup...just saying. Also the blue hurricane drink was really good too.

I see a lot of terrible reviews from their beginning. Perhaps this restaurant had some growing pains in the beginning, but it seems they've outgrown them. If you had a bad experience at its beginning, I encourage you to give it another try. The food, the sazeracs, the atmosphere, the staff...all excellent. I highly recommend this place whenever I can.

Spending your entire afternoon in a restaurant who can't get it together is not.     The owner looked very pretty and was prancing around outside but never once asked how things are going.  She should check on her staff and her customers a little more often or else this place is going to go up in smoke!   The food definitely isn't enough to keep it going (Can someone please season the chicken???)  Prices were all wrong on the check too, if you go keep the menu and check your bill before you leave.

I might not have minded as much if we ever saw our waitress for a refill on drinks..but we did not. We barely saw her the entire time we were there. She also had no knowledge whatsoever of the beers they offered. Finally our food comes and it is a huge disappointment. I got the chicken and waffles which came with a few tiny chicken tenders on top that were dry as can be. It was actually hard to cut through them. The mac and cheese was also dry and seemed like it had been sitting around and microwaved to reheat. My fiance got the brisket hash which he said the brisket was good but the potatoes were dry and flavorless. Our waitress finally asked us how our food was at the very end when she was giving us the check. She didn't do anything when we told her it wasn't good.. And to top it all off it was way overpriced. I don't have an issue paying money for a good meal but when it's sh**ty I have a huge issue. Will not be back. Save your money for Soul & Sea..the real MVP in Pittsburgh soul food.",

    "text": "I set out with one goal today: Have some good BBQ.  I ended up here and man is it wonderful.  I ordered the brisket and 2 sides.  First, the brisket, smoked 14 hours per the bartender and kitchen was soooo tender and it just fell apart.  Perhaps the best brisket I have ever had.  It also had some carmelized bits on top of the brisket which had amazing flavor.  It was served with a horsey type of sauce similar to what you would find with prime rib.  It did not need this sauce, but I tried it just to get the full experience and the sauce was perfect too.  My sides were mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.  I dont even like mac and cheese and i found myself scraping the dish with my fork to get more.  Everything was great and the space is beautiful.   After I finished lunch the owner or manager took me and another solo diner on a tour and showed us their overflow dining room and a space for parties.  He also said they were working on putting a space in the basement.      Everyone was so nice and the food was fire.  Cant wait to go back.  Really hope this place does well!",

After placing our order we waited an hour and a half before our food was ready. The food was just ok. I ordered chicken and waffles. Waffle was good but the chicken was over cooked. My cousin ordered catfish over a bed of rice which the fish didn't look very appetizing. If service is anything Tuesday - Saturday like today I don't know how Sugar and Smoke will last.

    "text": "We ate dinner at Sugar & Smoke in Bloomfield on Saturday, July 6th.  My sons were in town for the holiday weekend and one brought his friend.  I ordered a cocktail that had very little (if any) alcohol.  But it was tasty and refreshing so I shrugged that off. We ordered our appetizer and our dinners at the same time. The appetizer was the hush puppies.  They were OK, but like what a northerner would think hush puppies should be.  Then we waited almost an Hour for our dinners!  Honestly cannot think of why in the world it took so long.  There was our table and two others with patrons that I could see (maybe there was one or two more people in the bar area).  But that was it.  Holiday weekend, slow night.  And we were waiting so very long for our food.  I am from the south and have been waiting for someone in Pittsburgh to serve real southern food.  So when I saw 'chicken fried steak' on the menu, I was thrilled.  It's not hard to make but I rarely do, so I was excited to have it. The chicken fried steak was not at all prepared correctly.  Not at all anything remotely like southern chicken fried steak.    My husband ordered a fried catfish po boy.  The catfish was good.  And I ordered a side of greens (which were forgotten and brought out later, even later than the 1-hour wait).  They were OK too.  So the food wasn't bad -- it just wasn't SOUTHERN.  At all. And there was an incredibly long wait.  Finally our server was very nice and pleasant. And the atmosphere was good too.  We were busy enjoying each others company so it was a good night.  But my husband and I won't pay to eat there again.  If you live in Pittsburgh, can cook, and grew up in the south - PLEASE open a southern food restaurant.  Thank you in advance.",

    "text": "This place has MAJOR service issues. Which is a bummer, because the food was actually really good...once we got it! We had a group of 8 in for a reservation at 7:45 pm on a Saturday night.   There was no one at the host stand to greet us; some of our group had already arrived, though, so we just went and found the table ourselves. There was one water jug, which has maybe 4 servings in it, on the table when the rest of us sat down, and it took 15 minutes to get a second one, which we had to ask for, alongside silverware for two and another water glass because we were short on both. We also had to request from the hostess, who wasn't present at first because she's apparently also the water server, for our waitress to come over, probably another 10 minutes after that, to take our drink orders. Drinks took a solid 30 minutes to show up. The hostess and waitress made excuses a few times about having a bunch of unexpected large groups that night, but the restaurant was truly half empty when we got there. I don't think there was even anyone sitting at the bar.   The entrees didn't arrive until after 9:30 pm! We had two small appetizers and no soup/salad course in the meantime. When the entrees did finally start showing up, they showed up in 5-6 waves... smaller dishes first, some sides, then mains, then sandwiches, then some more sides. By the time the last person had all the components of their meal, 30 minutes had passed since they started, so the first food out was cold by then for the people who tried to kindly wait for everyone to be served first before diving in.   When the table of 4 next to us got up to leave, they asked us what we thought, saying all their food had come out cold and had to be sent back. We ended up leaving at 10:30 pm (for a 7:45 pm reservation at a casual restaurant, that's kind of ridiculous!) It was so late that a waitress started vacuuming the other rooms while we were still settling the bill. Then as we were leaving, two of the waitresses were sitting in the back bitching about other staff members, loud enough for us to hear... maybe on purpose so we wouldn't blame them? It was super unprofessional.  My husband and I had tried Sugar and Smoke in its first month and weren't very impressed, but I'm always willing to give a place a second chance once they have time to work out the kinks. We had also planned to bring our child in for brunch at some point, but one of my friends at dinner said they had brought their two kids and the service was so slow that their kids were bouncing off the wall by the time they got any food, so...no thank you, I won't be signing up for that experience. As I said, everyone's food was great, which is why I gave this 2 stars instead of 1, but it's not even worth writing about the food at this point because I don't plan on going back and wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know based on the overall customer experience.",

    "text": "Okay, kiddos. We gave it some time and ordered different food to see what has changed. It's Friday and we didn't make reservations this time. The dining space was more full, so we were seated at high tops by the bar. A musician was there and added some fun background sounds for our dining experience.  Shay took care of us and was awesome. No limited beer options this time. We ordered crafts and mulled over the menu. I love southern sides, but didn't think a couple alone (collard greens and mac and cheese) was enough. The gumbo and she crab soup were on my radar and asked Shay for her thoughts. No hesitation, she was all about the she crab, though noted it was on the spicy side. All goods. Hubs ordered the chicken and waffles. We shared brussel sprouts to start.  The brussel sprouts were solid. Lightly charred with cheese. I could have used some salt, but Hubs thought it was fine as is. My soup arrived, too. I made the mistake of not asking for it with dinner, so it got cold waiting for dinner to arrive. The soup itself was indeed spicy, more on the pepper flavor. It was more like bisque, with crab on top, so the flavors of the crab were less pronounced. Still solid and Hubs, not generally a fan of cream-based soup enjoyed it, too. My Mac and cheese was delightful, though I needed salt again. The collard greens were on point! It's cooked with some pork, so adds that southern flavor. Hub's chicken and waffle came with three pieces of wings! The waffle had a mild sweetness.   Glad to see the spot coming along. Definitely more of a neighborhood vibe and they've improved a bit!",

The place was basically empty. A few other tables filled, but nothing like the volume you would expect in a trendy neighborhood on a Saturday. Should have been the first sign.   We ordered a round of drinks that took forever to arrive. It was also extremely inconsistent, as was everything all night. Our waitress \"recommended\" a watermelon cocktail to me - it was horrible. Think red Four Loko. But priced like a glass of wine. With zero alcohol. One of the tap beers we ordered was spoiled and was sent back. Someone else had an issue with temperature of the shot of liquor they ordered, but we honestly couldn't stop laughing at how everyone's drink was either overpriced or terrible or both that I missed what his order was.   Our dinners took so long to come out. Probably 45-60 minutes waiting for our food. Everything we got was inconsistent. Some of it was good, some of it was bad. My meal was alright, but one member of our group ordered the Pittsburgh Hot Chicken... it was literally a chicken tender on a cafeteria bun with jar pickles on the side. It was so bad we actually found it funny.   On top of it all our waitress was either rude or busy or uninterested... she barely spoke to us, we asked for recommendations and she basically just said whatever we asked about was good (unhelpful, as proven by the Four Loko), and took about 10 years to bring our checks. Oh and my Four Loko, a beer, and two burgers (that we ate all of without being stuffed) ran us $80. So that was fun.",

But after my friend insisting that things had gotten better I decided to give it a shot!   I came with a group of four on a Friday night. We had a reservation for 6:30pm and started at the bar. The decor is cute and the staff is friendly and attentive.   I ordered two of there signature \"sugar\" drinks. Both were very good but weak! For dinner I ordered the lobster po'boy. What I know of po'boys is that the meat is fried and there is a remoulade on stop. What I was served seemed more like a lobster roll. Cold lobster mixed with a cream based sauce on a roll. It also took some time to get our food.   I'll still be back sometime in the near future. Hoping they get all their pieces clicking because I love to see black businesses thrive!",

    "text": "So where do I start?  This is from a visit in the beginning of October 2018.  So I want to start off by saying, I know this is a new restaurant, so I will give them time to get the kinks out.  Unfortunately, I can't give them more than or less than 3 stars for that reason.   I was excited to try out the new restaurant,  so I went with my husband for a date night.  We were greeted at the door and immediately told that the regular chef was off, so they had a fill-in for the day, so the menu would be limited.    I figured the fill-in chef should be able to execute the dishes, so we stayed.   We enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant and the modern decor was very appealing.  We were escorted to our seats by the server and then warned by her that a party of 10 was coming soon, so we need to get our order in ASAP.  We reviewed the menu and I ordered the brisket and my husband ordered the steak, medium-well.  For the sides we requested mac & cheese and greens, but they ran out of greens, so I got corn muffins and he got mixed vegetables.  The waitress took our orders and then her party of  10 had come in.  She attended to them and when our food come out, that the last we heard from her in a while.  (At least 30 -40 minutes) We had to keep making hand gestures to get her to acknowledge us and come over.  Now the food: Brisket unfortunately was dry and crumbly, I feel like I got the shavings of the outside of the meat.  The mac and cheese was ok, I was hoping for baked mac, but It was stove top creamy similar to velveeta shells and cheese.  My husband's steak was medium-rare, instead of well.  I understand most people may eat rare, but it should be cooked as he requested.  He did say the vegetables were seasoned well and were delicious.  Overall, we were not fully satisfied with our visit, but I won't completely write them off.  This place can be great, I think I just need to give them more time (maybe 6 months to 1 yr) and try again when the real chef is there.",

Wonderful spiciness to accompany high quality ingredients, I'm not sure how to make this dish any better. Where NOLA falls short, Sugar and Smoke delivers.   The beer list is intriguing and satisfying. I was happy to select an East End Big Hop to accompany my meal.  I received excellent service, and was delighted to meet both the chef and the owner.   The location can't be beat, Del's was very successful in this spot for many years.",

From the decor to the hostesses, this restaurant surpassed any expectation of what it is to host at a fancy restaurant by treating their guest with respect, being attentive, and being about great home cooked food.   Ok for starters, let's talk about food,  The menu consisted of two proteins, one veggie, and a starch, as the following:  Collard greens - the greens were succulent! They were also flavorful and had meat (turkey meat) in it. This was prepared well enough for you to make you think a grandma from the south made this dish. Well done.   Macaroni and cheese - many restaurants don't do this justice and I can say for sure that this restaurant did it justice! It was so cheesy flavorful and well made. I can't say how using real cheese go a long way. Also, how delicious the seasoning is when it's done properly.  Salmon - this was prepared by smoking it but the juices were still there! There's nothing worst than badly prepared fish. So flavorful and juicy.   Smoked Chicken - this delicious chicken fell off the bones, man was it good. Can't go wrong with smoked seasoned well chicken. The reduction on the chicken was cooked in a way that you still tasted the juice in the chicken. Very well done.",

Once people catch on to how amazing Sugar and Smoke is, you will definitely need one.  Our waitress was nice and super helpful when we asked questions about the food.  I was in Nashville the week before and had my very first fried green tomato there.  The fried green tomatoes from Sugar and Smoke taste like they are straight out of the South!  The owner even came up to chat with us and thank us for coming in.  It's a new restaurant, so I'm sure they still have their kinks, but Sugar and Smoke is absolutely worth a try!",

It should have been a sign that it took 30 minutes to get our drinks, and over an hour to get only two appetizers.   There were others seated around us with the same experience. No one was getting their food, except for one table nearby that got the wrong order.   The waitress seemed troubled by the delay in our food, but didn't offer much applogy let alone a comped drink or appetizer.   It took over THREE hours to get out entrees. The most confusing part is that most of us ordered brisket...which would have been done already since it's cooked in advance. How did it take three hours to put brisket on a plate with a bun?  Not once did a manager come over to our table, or any others, to offer an apology for the wait. We were there so long that we even noticed a nearby waiter tell his table that he had \"somewhere else to be\" and that he needed to leave their table in the hands of someone else.   I'm not sure what the calling is of the owners or managers of this restaurant, but it's not owning and operating a restaurant. If you value your time and money, do not go anywhere near this restaurant.",

    "text": "Alright.. here we go. So this is a group effort review, for a friends night out. We met at Sugar and Smoke on a Friday at 5pm - it was suggested we make reservations, we did but clearly did not need them. We were greeted with the server telling us that the drafts were not working and they were offering a special on wine.. a bottle of merlot, regularly $40 but comped $5 off.. so $35 for the bottle. And no other specials - that's how it was presented.  I ordered the Sugar and Smoke Stack which I would give a 4/5 because the combination of smoked/bbq meats were amazing. I loved the Alabama  White sauce which was mayo and horse radish based. My friends got the chicken and waffles and another ordered the salmon. Salmon was dry, but greens on the side were amazing.  Chicken and waffles where \"good\", when asked. Waffle tasty, chicken tender with nice spice. Neither finished their meal ps... alright, so our favorites so far was the atmosphere of the restaurant.. low lighting, we loved the warm feel. Service wasn't that great.. server messed up a few of our drinks, we got odd bar ware (according to my friends.. I honestly don't care, a drink is a drink, doesn't matter what it's served in).    I should also add that we went to get \"dessert\" at Baby Loves Taco.. lol, who does that after a dinner? We were extremely impressed with their tacos, hospitality, generosity. Review to follow there.",

    "text": "You know I will never understand horrible reviews when it comes to a grand opening. I've read the negative ones about opening last night and all I can ask myself is, \"what do people expect?\" It's the first day for crying out loud, give the establishment a chance to work out the kinks. We went today for an early dinner; reservations at 4 pm. It wasn't overwhelmingly busy but there was a  steady flow of patrons. Also it's Steeler Sunday so you know... The decor and design are spot on. As soon as we walked in the door it felt new, better and so different than the previous place (Jabo's). There's a fantastic VIP room that's relaxing and reminiscent of a high-end jazz club. The owner Andrea and her daughter Morgan stopped by our table and chatted with us. Wonderful and lovely mother and daughter. Andrea is a smart business woman with a grand love of food. Serving a menu that offers a mixture of the finest southern delicacies, brisket and bbq.  My boyfriend and I shared a plate of fried green tomatoes that were so juicy with a flavorful and light breading cooked to perfection. My boyfriend had the gumbo that was packed with okra, rice, sausage and peppers. I had a taste of it and had trouble giving it back to him because it was simply fantastic! Hit all the right notes on my pallet. The Pittsburgh Hot Chicken Sandwich is huge!! More than big enough for two. Served on a lightly toasted brioche bun with a sauce that hits just the right level of heat. The chicken was fried Southern-style with a crisp breading that didn't taste greasy but instead exactly the way a good fried chicken should taste. We finished with dessert. We shared beignets sprinkled with powdered sugar and sides of chocolate sauce, Kentucky bourbon sauce and Chantilly cream.  Those beignets were a dream come True I tell you! Pittsburgh twist on a NOLA classic. The staff are friendly, on point and extremely knowledgeable.  Our server Sarah described item menus with intricate detail and took us on a tour of the VIP room. We  were even given a sample of the brisket which the chef preps with a coffee marinade for 12 hours. Not hard to figure out what we're ordering next time. As Bloomfield residents, we agree this is a welcome addition to our neighborhood!",

I can forgive the unflattering decor and inexperienced (slow, untrained, unavailable) service, but I can't really forgive the mediocre food that continues to plague this building.  Our $21 plate of brisket was served gray, contained mostly fat, and seemed to be pulled/chopped, not sliced. There wasn't any carbonation in our drinks from the tap. The \"sugar and smoke\" sauce tasted like ketchup. The sides were nice. I really enjoyed the coleslaw. I'm also not sure why a place like this doesn't service the sandwiches, which look to be the most appetizing and affordable options, beyond lunch.   It isn't worth itemizing the mistakes made on our bill or the slow service other than just suggesting that the staff could use some training and the space could use some branding. The menu could use some simplifying and I'm not interested in paying $50 for two people to eat uninspiring food that I could make better at home.",

The hush puppies were tasty, and the pecan salad arrived sans pecans, but I guess the other waitress noticed and brought them in a small cup on the side.   However my real issue was with the speed of service. I'm good with my food being cooked to order, but not when it seems to include a trip to the fish market and supermarket for ingredients.   My very simple dinner was almost a 2 hour evolution!  I could even understand if I arrived during the dinner rush, however the dinner rush didn't start until an hour after I was seated.  My server was friendly and personable, however...2 hours?  The menu is limited (and they were out of two of their entrees (meatloaf and brisket which seemed to strange) so I'm again hard pressed to understand the delay.  The decor is nice and trendy, so if one is looking for a place to chill after work, with some ok eats, different from the usual fare, then this place fits that bill.  I wouldn't make a special trip there, but again when looking for something different in the burgh, it's on the list of places to try.    Oh, if by some chance the owners see my post, beyond what is mentioned, I'd suggest acoustic tiles.  The place gets really loud really quick because of the high ceilings.   I really wanted to rave about this place, but...",

I'm excited to try the food of their menu when they officially open their doors (which they announced will be on Sept 15!).

    "text": "My sister and I went to dinner at Sugar n Smoke last Friday and let me just say it was an excellent experience.  Everyone there I really nice. The staff appeared to enjoy working there.  Cocktails were good and served promptly.  We moved to a table and J was our server.  She was excellent, gave us suggestions, gave us time to order and always checked back with us.  We ordered the Hush Puppies and Fried Green Tomatoes as apps.  The Hush Puppies were pretty good and the Fried Green Tomatoes were a hit.  I'm not a FGT guy but I was all about them.  And the remoulade served with both items was tasty.  My sister ordered the Cajun Salmon and I the Shrimp n Grits, she also got a side of greens and mac n cheese.  The mac n cheese really wasn't fresh so we had to return it.  We sampled each others meals and were both very happy.  The salmon was awesome (wish I had ordered that) but my shrimp n grits was on point, and it was a nice sized serving.  I actually took 3/4 of it home and had a second meal the next day (J hooked me up with a little extra sauce.  Love her!!)  Oh, my nephew joined us later and they allowed us to move to a larger table.  He had the Shrimp Po Boy which he liked but wasn't expecting the shrimp to be corn meal dusted.  It was gone in no time so......lol  The maitre'd or manager (not sure of his position) was really accommodating. And even though they were getting busy for Friday dinner, we never felt rushed to finish and pay.  We had a great experience and can't wait to go back.  Almost forgot about the live keyboard player, I actually thought it was recorded music.  That really added a nice touch to the atmosphere.  Nice job with the menu Chef Chaz!!  Thanks Gary for being a great host and letting us peak at the downstairs lounge/party room.  They did a great job with the building.  Good luck Andrea, I wish you many years of success.  This was a nice add to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene.  See you all very soon!!",
