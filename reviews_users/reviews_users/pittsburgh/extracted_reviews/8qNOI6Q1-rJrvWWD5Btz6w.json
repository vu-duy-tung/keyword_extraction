They are all fake and I really disappointed about it. They forced me to pay 18% tip. What hell is that? If I could rate it 0 star, I would.",

I have always liked their Cesar salad the that give you as an appetizer but I cannot say the same for the entree version. It was absolutely freezing. The ones that they serve you as appetizers are warm and delicious. This one was so cold that when I took a bite, I felt that sensation that you feel when biting into ice cream. I was completely unsatisfied with it. My advice to all of you, do not order a Cesar salad as an entree here at Luciano's.",

We even called ahead this time to make sure we'd have a table ready and we still had to wait for 20 minutes to be seated.  When the hostess took us to our table, most of the restaurant was empty and the lobby was FULL with people waiting outside.    I'm a vegetarian, so when I ordered I asked if there was meat in their sauce.  The waitress said no, but there is meat juice in the sauce.  She said \"in case you are allergic to meat, its okay because they just drain the juice off of meat and use it in the sauce, but there are no meat chunks.\"  That eliminated 99% of the menu for us.  The food takes FOREVER to arrive.  Our salad and bread plates were never cleared from the table so we started stacking dishes at one end of the table.  My sister-in-law asked the waitress if someone could please clear the table, but that request was ignored.  I had the bruschetta as my entree which was smothered in cheese so it was more like pizza bread than bruschetta.  My husband had manicotti and it was cold when it arrived and completely flavorless.    Unfortunately, I'd have a better experience at Olive Garden.",

The restaurant was packed with customers. We had to wait several minutes for a booth near the bar. The bar was not our preference because it was noisy, but at least we got a place to sit. I liked the taste of my house salad, the table bread with olive oil, my broiled cod with broccoli, and my husband's chicken parmesan (yes, I ate some of his food!). The waitress brought out the food without long waits. The price was not expensive. The problem that we had was that the waitress gave only one out of four people a drink refill, so three people had drunk all of their first drink and were very thirsty. I was sucking furiously on my straw to drink the melted ice cube water. Because of the lack of drink refills, my husband left a small tip. Overall: decent food for the price.",

There are some downsides to Luciano's, but I normally choose to look past them, but for the sake of the review I'll share. If you're dining in, the drink selection is awful! They literally have the worst tasting drinks ever. If I'm dining in, I normally just bring a bottle of water in my purse. The other downside is the price of their toppings. The price increases per topping depending on which size pizza you get. I got a large pizza not too long ago with two toppings and ended up paying over $20. I think that's a bit ridiculous, however, you just cant find better pizza!",

My most unpleasant experience was wish I ordered a pizza for pick up and when I got home the crust was burnt and there were barely any toppings and the cheese was only on half!!! Like HELLO. Someone actually thought it was acceptable to put that in the box. Terrible. Not to mention their pieces aren't the cheapest. I have refused to return. Go to Woodys instead!",

No problem with that and was told 25 minutes for pick-up.  Arrived 30 minutes later and asked if pizza done.  No was all I was told by the cashier.  After a while the older gentleman running the oven asked what order I was waiting on and I told him.  No response back but assumed at this point my pizza was at least in the oven.  After 10 minutes longer I again asked about the status as it appeared my pizza had just been put in the oven.  Ends up it was my pizza.  Why would you tell people 25 minutes when you know the pick-up time is closer to an hour, and why not have the courtesy to tell someone when they are waiting to pick up their order that it hasn't even been put in the oven yet?  Very poor service on several levels.",

    "text": "We were looking for a bite to eat, close to home, yet somewhere new.  After some thought we ended up at Lucianos in White Oak.  It was odd entering, seeing a sign saying \"Please wait to be seated\" with no hostess or waitstaff in sight.  There were empty tables, so it was odd when someone finally came up and gave us a pager for a 5 minute wait.  Shortly after another hostess arrived, wondered why we were told to wait, and quickly seated us.  When our waitress arrived, we ordered a couple beers and bruchetta for an appetizer.  When it came, it was quite large in size, not portion.  Flavorful and had a zesty marinara sauce on the side.  Dinner was Chicken Parmesan.  This dish is how I gauge an Italian restaurant because it allows me to sample the pasta, sauce, and how well they can cook chicken.  Unfortunately my chicken was significantly overcooked.  Perhaps it was frozen instead of fresh? The sauce was flavorful and the pasta was al dente.    The BF ordered a meatball calzone.  He felt the meatballs were bland and the only flavor he got was when he added the marinara to it.    To quote 10 Things I Hate About You:  \"I know you can be overwhelmed and you can be underwhelmed, but can you ever just be whelmed?\"  To me that is Lucianos - sub-par service, decently priced, and certain foods are okay.",

Chicken Parm is another favorite. The Wedding Soup is spot on.   The servers are usually very pleasant but the hostesses and managers are TERRIBLE. They have the attitude that you are bothering them by being there and if something is wrong, they try to turn it around on you. If that only happened once, I'd just brush it off, but it has happened several times. Sorry, but when you order a pizza for delivery and they bring you something completely different, I'm not taking partial blame for that.   I'd suggest you just go to Tillie's Restaurant down the road.",

To begin with, the salads lately are made up of nothing but lettuce cores, and brown ones at that. There isn't a piece of leaf lettuce to be found, but there are enough carrot shavings to sink a ship. A few years ago they made a real good salad that was full of fresh romaine, but I guess times are tough. The chicken parmesan is chronically undercooked, to the point that it tastes like rubber.   The employees also disappoint. Sit-down service is okay, but prepare yourself for blood-boiling frustration if you try and place a take out order. The girls working the phones are so distant and inattentive that, the last time I called, they asked me for my name four times, what side I wanted three times, and then put me on hold for 5 minutes, and then hung up on me! I called back and cancelled my order. Take my advice: go there to sit down or don't go at all. This isn't a new occurrence, either; with each (increasingly infrequent) call they seem more stoned.   I won't give Luciano's one star because of the happy memories I have of this place, but I'll give it the next worst thing. If you want a good meal with good service, drive five minutes down the road to Tillie's in McKeesport.",

When I inquired, the waitress checked the menu, confirming the $18.25, then she checked with the manager who told her to show me the section on the menu that said 'prices may vary'.  Not an apology for not bringing this to our attention, not even a courtesy visit to our table from the manager.

Went on a Saturday at 4:45, party of 6, seated right away (although they originally told us it would be a 15 minute wait, not sure what happened there, but fine with me). Server was great, food came out hot and in a timely manner. We got a variety of dishes. Some better than others which leads me to give 4 stars instead of 5.  Fried Zucchini: large portion and crispy, but needed salt. Sauce that came with it was also good.  Buffalo Chicken Pizza: best I've ever had, the only bad thing about it was how much of it I ate. Seriously, it was so good.   Chicken and Steak salads: those of the party that had this thought it was great!  Steak Calzone: not so great, probably the only dish that was not enjoyed. I would be a little more lenient if they were a different type of restaurant, but their speciality is pizza and a calzone technically rolls up in the pizza category since it uses all the same ingredients.   Aside from the calzone and zucchini not meeting expectations, I'd say our experience here was fantastic and I would definitely return. When we left there was practically a line out the door of people waiting to get seated, so I would definitely get there early or call ahead (if they accept that, I'm not sure). It has a great atmosphere and the employees are very nice and accommodating.",

We decided to go back to try the homemade pasta. The sauce is good, the wedding soup was okay. Okay that's it for me.  The homemade Gnocchi was over cooked and was mushy. The bead was small and hard and mostly crust. The Lasagna had a burnt taste to it.  I will not return for pasta. I will give the pizza & beer another go.

The meatballs were definitely recycled and kept for at least a week. It was completely noticeable. I also complained about it but nothing was done. When I got home, I was very sick and also vomited the next day. Horrible food. 1.25 out of 10. I'd rather starve...  Also, an ex-employee there told me the behind the scenes of Luciano's. He said everything there was completely recycled and kept over for long periods of time. The workers also get treated unfairly. My friend has been in the food industry for over 10 years and that is the worst that he's seen. That really says something doesn't it? Never going back there again.  By the way, the 1.25 is for the decor. It looks nice!",

For the price of the alfredo with shrimp you would think they give you more than a tiny cup of soup as the side. Also the fountain drinks on the menu say only one refill. For higher end restaurant seems cheap to limit to only one refill.  Would not recommend going there.",

We were the only ones waiting the entire time, I even walked into the bar looking for someone to seat us.  After we finally got seated we sat there for another 10 minutes before someone came over. We ordered as soon as someone did. I got my salad which was just some average iceberg lettuce with two cherry tomatoes and a cucumber slice. Then the wait began. We waited. And waited. And waited. 45 minutes to get one small bowl of awful penne and three pieces of bruschetta. The sauce tasted like tin can, like old canned tomatoes. Neither of us could eat it because it was so bad. The bruschetta was also terrible. It was hard, crunchy and tasteless. We took maybe four bites of our food and waited for our waiter to return. I told the waiter we didn't want a box. He didnt even ask what was wrong with our meal, just jetted off with my card. Not planning to return.",

I5 minutes just to get sited then 10-15 minutes just to get drinks then 1 hour and 20 minutes to get a god awful Gyro Pizza . The gyro meat was the same as you get in the Gyro kit in the frozen section in the grocery store for $3.98 NOT REAL GYRO , the crust was also frozen pre-made , the cheese and sauce are sub par at best . All at the price of $20.00 ! WTH ? My wife got a shrimp supersize that was dry and only had 4 shrimps in it  my kid got Raw Samoan that had some cold sauce on it , all this over $64.00 ! The menu's are old paper and ripped , the tables have clear cocking holding them to the wall and with today's CREDIT CARD idea thief's you have to give your card to the waitress that disappears with it for 20 minutes what the what ? We are checking are card daily now :(  for any charges we didn't make ! It took so long to get the waitress , she was just to busy with friends here and there talking to them while we just got to sit and wait over and over stuck here for over 3 hours . We finally just walked out !",

    "text": "I stopped dining in due to the horrible service and general mess in the dining area, but kept getting take-out because the food was still decent.  The last three times our order has been done at least 20 minutes later than we were told on the phone.    We recently ordered take-out, only 3 items.  It was ready 25 minutes late because they forgot part of the order, so the rest of the food was cold by the time we came home.  After getting home, we realized the order was wrong and called the restaurant.  We were told they no longer carry the menu item we had ordered and that the online menu was outdated.  They offered no explanation why they did not tell us we could not order this item or call back to ask what we would like as a substitute instead of giving us whatever they felt like.  They were not concerned that the online menu is inaccurate and has bad prices, which is not surprising considering the horrible service.  I will not be going back.",

Their pizza is still quite delicious, however it was not what it once was. Luciano's is still a nice local restaurant that offers decent service and food, although there are plenty of other establishments in the surrounding area that offer better options.

I ordered chicken piccata for my family and the mashed potatoes were not peeled well or mashed well and contained the eyes from the potatoes.  I was sick for 3 days after eating their pizza that was supposed to be gluten free and wasn't.  I ordered a dirty martini that contained salad olives. Not martini olives.  No quality wine.

    "text": "Love the eggplant parm (my favorite in the area), Italian hoagie is good, as is the larger one with sausage and pepperoni, like Luccis pizza, their Diablo, and chicken parm too, I've been coming here since the early 80's (in the old rainbow shopping center) their food is consistent.  The restaurant area is noisy and sometimes service can be slow if you're looking for some quiet space you may want to select a booth in the bar area.  We've had 2 events here, my moms wake and granddaughters birthday, both were alright....The only issue I've had was when trying to schedule my dads 80th birthday party, after several attempts, their events coordinator did not call me so we booked at nearby Woodys which worked out to our advantage because we had the entire restaurant to ourselves along with great food and service.",
