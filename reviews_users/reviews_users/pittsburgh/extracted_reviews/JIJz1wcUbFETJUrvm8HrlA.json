I've had sandwiches, soup, salad bar and kids macaroni and cheese. We've enjoyed all of them. I wish the prices were slightly lower. The place is clean with a friendly atmosphere and wonderful customer service if you order inside. I've used the drive thru 3 times and this is their downfall and why they lost a star for me. Each time they have not taken my order for a while even though there's no line. I actually waited 5 mins once and said \"hello\" a few times and then drove away when no one took my order. It takes a while to get your order in and then it takes a while to get your food. My soup was cold by the time I got it home which was about 10 mins later and they didn't give me a spoon or any napkins or anything. Overall a good place but they need to keep working on perfecting the drive thru experience.",

The menu board listed Local Favorites as well as manager's specials. I grabbed a paper menu and looked it over. So many more options than Panera! I went with the Broccoli Cheddar soup and the Amy-O Turkey Sandwich. The soup was still hot when i got home and really tasty. The sandwich was full of meat, the bun was toasted but not burnt and the veggies were fresh and crispy. There is an app available for easy fast ordering and this location had a drive through.",

But nearly all of the vegetables on the salad bar were old, transparent, and inedible. Most were clearly just straight from a large can, straight to the bar. By the time my sandwich came out, I loss some of my appetite.   The sandwich itself was OK, and the servers were all friendly... but considering this location hasn't been open very long, I expected more from their salad bar.",

Soup, salad, pasta, wraps and sandwiches. The best part is after you finish the meal (or before for those that like dessert first) there is soft serve ice cream. They have mini cones or small cups to help yourself. The ice cream had little flavor and tasted icy. But it was free!!  My husband had the chicken Alfredo lite. Not sure what made it \"lite\". The portion size was perfect, creamy and tasty. It was served hot too!! I had the Mediterranean wrap which I felt was a little thin. They could have added more veggies. Overall not bad for a cheap little lunch for under $20.",

Delicious, but huge!  Salad bar is maintained and neat as is the drink station.  The best part of Jason's is the free ice cream.  Yes, I just said FREE ice cream - in cone or cup form.  What a sweet way to end a yummy meal!  Kudos to the service members up front: it was uplifting to hear positive banter between managers and coworkers while they worked on the orders.  Nice dynamic they seem to have here!   Will definitely recommend!",

Kids chicken nuggets were ice cold, like they just came out of refrigerator and not heated up at all. Same with kids Mac n cheese. Side of fruit that came with the kids meal came in a large plastic cup, but literally only had 4 pieces of fruit: 2 tiny strawberries and 2 very small pieces of cantaloupe.  Very disappointed. You'd think with waiting for 5 minutes in drive-thru that hey could have taken the time to heat the food.",

    "text": "It was our first time at a Jason's deli.  Walking in, we were greeted and they gave us take out menus, which was a good thing, because for some reason on their menu board they only have about 1/4 of the items they serve there, which I thought was very odd.  Me and my wife both got half sandwiches and one trip to the salad bar.  Our son got bowtie pasta and meatballs.  Service was fast, by the time my wife watched our son and I got the salad bar, our food was already at the table, and she hadn't even had a chance to get her salad yet.    The salad bar was fine, it was about similar to what you'd expect from Eat N Park, but soup is sold separately.  My main complaint with it was, there was NO french dressing.  They had an adequate selection of dressings, but not french.  I settled for 1000 Island, but kind of regretted it after I did since I have to be in the mood for it.  Also, the one trip to the salad bar is kind of annoying.  More so because if you want potato salad, cole slaw, etc., you gotta stack it all together on the plate and it all gets mixed in to your salad.  They even had pudding up there, which looked untouched, because I don't think anyone in their right mind would even chance having pudding mix in with the salad.  I got the reuben sandwich.  It was good and meaty, but they put about an equal amount of sauerkraut on there as they did meat.  I've never seen so much sauerkraut on a sandwich, so I had to scrape off about 75% of it to make it like a normal reuben.  The corn beef was awesome though.  Probably some of the best I've ever had.  They also screwed up and gave me Salt and Vinegar chips instead of BBQ.  I didn't even complain because I wasn't hungry enough to eat them anyway after the salad and sandwich, which was plenty of food.  My sons pasta was kind of bleh.  Not that it wasn't edible, but you can make better tasting pasta out of a box at home.  It was a nice option for him, because he's not a sandwich eater, but he'll eat pasta all day every day.  At the end of your meal, they give you free ice cream.  We would not have known about it though, except they told the people in front of us, and I overheard them, but they didn't inform us about it.    Overall, the service was good, everyone was friendly and made sure we were happy, and the food was reasonably good.  I'm sure I'd go back if I was ever up that way and was hungry for a sandwich, but I wouldn't make a special trip there again like I did today.",

The menu is much more extensive though and they also have a full salad bar. I've gotten a half sandwich/soup combo. My panini was great. I can't recall the name of it, but it had chicken and pesto. The broccoli and cheese soup is a little thick, but very delicious. I also love the complimentary soft serve ice cream and crackers/muffins.",

They were attentive and helpful while we ordered.  We got a couple of sandwiches, chips and drinks all for $20 or so.  We went to sit down to wait for our food to come out.  I hadn't even noticed how long it was since we weren't really in a rush, but about 15 minutes after we ordered the team member walking the floor noticed our wait, apologized and said she would go check on our food.  We were kind of surprised she was so attentive, but appreciated her response even though were we not upset in the slightest.  3-5 minutes later, the manager came out, apologized again, gave us a $10 gift card, and shortly after our food was ready.   I've been many places with slow service and get frustrated by it and this wasn't slow to begin with, so it made an already good experience better knowing how in tune the staff was with everyone on the floor.  On top of a great meal, and a $10 gift card for the short wait, they have free soft serve ice cream!   Overall a great experience and we will definitely be back!",

They have lots of options on their kids menu, which is nice. However, my kids don't love their food. They have tried the pasta, pizza and macaroni and cheese.

    "text": "So I think I might've accidentally ruined my friend's keto diet by finding a new favorite place for her (and myself) when she craves sandwiches. If there's one thing Pittsburgh does right, it's the sandwiches.  I got this Panera vibe when I walked in. That's not a bad thing to me, it just felt cozy and welcoming. They have a very spacious dining area with a salad bar and they have unlimited ice cream on the side also. Now about the salad bar, one side you need to pay extra for, the other side (plus the pickles) are unlimited (they have ginger bread there, so you must try that).  So when my friend and I went up to order, the front cashier lady was so welcoming and SUCH A SWEETHEART. Idk, but her bright blue eyes were so warm and sweet, it almost felt like I was talking to a puppy. She was generous at answering our questions and offering suggestions, that I felt confident that what we were about to order would be decent choices. And yes, I was really happy with what we ordered.  We got the Muffaletta with salami & ham and I got the poboy with the salami (of course we both got salt & vinegar chips). The food is also very delicious and hit the sandwich craving.  The cashier also told us that we can order a whole Muffaletta sandwich as well. So I think the next time my friend throws a party or has a mini get together, she could just order the Muffaletta(s) straight up and slice it up at home. I forgot how much she said it cost, but I think it was like $13-$16 for a rather large sandwich. Definitely a great party idea.  TL;DR Ruin your diet here. Order the Muffaletta. Enjoy all the pickles, ice cream, ginger bread, crackers, etc. Or pay extra for other salad sides. Enjoy excellent customer service here also.",

I think it took one second to be acknowledged the second, and I mean the second, I walked up to the counter.    The second thing I want to point out,  is to take your time studying the menu . There is even a nice comfy chair near the counter to sit down on while you decide your order.  Do not skim over this menu since there is so much to consider.  Try to take the time to dine in.  Dining room is very relaxing,and the food should be savored not devoured. My muffelta sandwich was nicely prepared and delicious.   There was plenty of staff on hand  who stayed busy keeping the area clean, and orderly.  Definitely a place to visit regularly.",

    "text": "Went in since we had groceries in the car for take out. Ordered and watched other people come in and get their food. After the second group got their food, I went up and asked the status of our order. Was told they are working on it. I mentioned other people are getting their orders, they said it is coming. I waited for awhile again it has now been 25 minutes since we ordered according to the receipt time stamp. I am watching the take out counter and now take out orders that I watched them walk in and order are getting their food. I asked to see the manager, the take out counter staff member got the manager. He stood there and watched as the manager came out and talked to us. I watched her go back and walk out 15 seconds later with our order. I commented was it just sitting there? She looked at me and lied, saying they just finished it up. Which is impossible since no one was behind the counter. What bothered me was that when I first asked no one checked on my order, didn't even ask my name. Then when manager lies to my face, it tells me not to return here. I would of rather heard a sorry we made a mistake and it would have been fine.BTW this order was three sandwiches and three soups. There were 8 diners seated and 4 people in line , this wasn't a lunch rush.",

    "text": "Another great addition to the North Hills Block area and another blast from my past in Columbus! That's right! Another one of my favorites found it's way to Pittsburgh soon after I moved here.  I'm not saying it's me, but I'm happy for whatever the reason may be.  Jason's Deli is a quick and fast eat in or take out joint that offers a number of delicious deli sandwiches ranging from traditional Paninis, Clubs, and Wraps to more specialized Muffalettas (Olive based spreads).  You can even build your own sandwich if you like. They also have a number of salads and an extensive salad bar with plenty of options and a few Pasta dishes.  And don't forget the soup. Then there is everyone's favorite...free ice cream!!!  They option I typically go for is the Manager's Special which is any half sandwich with your choice of chips along with either soup or one trip to the salad bar for about $10 after tax.  You can really load up on the salad bar and the sandwich portions are fairly large so a half will be fine for a nice lunch. I'm a fan of the Pastrami with Swiss and Spicy Mustard and the Ham/Salami Muffaletta. It's all been good so pick what fits your fancy!  The staff is very helpful and attentive. Almost too attentive though. I was greeted as I entered and the menu was explained in detail even though I had been there before. Once I sat and my food was brought out, I was asked by 3 different people if I was doing okay or needed anything.  While I appreciate it, I also just wanted to eat.  All in all, I'd say the trade off was worth it.  Oh, and if you don't want to go in, there is a drive-thru and you can order online.",

It's so nice and convenient for a large group. You can start an online group order and send the link to the order to whoever. From there, they can place their own order under the group name, and pay for it on their own, but it is all delivered together with everyone name on it! Genius!!  The menu is huge!! Lots of hot and cold sandwiches, soups, salads, and side dishes. My office mate and I decided to each get a whole sandwich and split them. I got the California club on a croissant and she got the Italian. Both were fantastic!! The dressing on the Italian was SO good and the croissant on my club was so soft and flaky!  However, I did not love my vegetable soup.  All of my coworkers enjoyed their food- I am sure we will be ordering again soon!",

    "text": "After hearing lots of people rave about Jason's Deli I has happy to finally see what all the hype was all about. One day while shopping in the area with my daughter we decided to stop and check them out.  For those of you who haven't been Jason's Deli offers a ton of different items. They offer soups, salads, pasta dishes such as chicken alfredo, penne pasta and meatballs and chicken pasta prima. Different types of loaded potatoes with interesting topping like beef brisket, spinach and pico de gallo. They also offer sandwiches like Muffalettas, Paninis, Turkey Clubs, Reubens, Wraps. You can even build your own sandwich if you don't see one that you like on the menu.  After mulling over the menu I chose the Big E's Deli Burger. It's a roast beef sandwich that tastes like a cheeseburger! It features hot roast beef, American cheese, house made Savage Sauce, lettuce, tomato on a toasted onion bun. Served with chips. The roast beef was so tender and juicy. It was amazing!   My daughter chose the Chicken Alfredo. It features penne pasta topped with grilled chicken breast, creamy Alfredo sauce and Asiago cheese and comes served with toasted herb focaccia bread on the side. She absolutely love it and devoured every bit of it.   We both chose sweet tea for our drinks. Even their sweet tea was really, really good. We were stuffed after our meals, but we made sure to get some of their FREE soft serve ice cream before we left.  If you're ever in the area be sure to check them out. If only we could get one in the eastern suburbs.",

    "text": "Jason's deli is a chain that opened its 2nd location in the Pittsburgh area. The first one is in Cranberry Twp. Upon arrival I was greeted warmly and told that all customers are entitled to free soft serve ice cream. They have on the side of the room where you can either serve yourself in a small dish or cake cone.  They have a drive through and preordering is available. I saw that if you download their app then you would get $5.00 of your check. The hostess helped me with the menu and went over pairings of soup and 1/2 sandwich or if you want to add the salad bar. The salad bar is slightly extra for one trip and you pay $1.00 more over that if you want unlimited trips.  I went over to look at it. It has two sections. One is your traditional salad bar fare and the other section offers various desserts. Everything lists calorie counts if that is important to you. They have a good selection of different wraps, sandwiches, and salads. They also serve muffalettas of which the bread is made out of an olive mix. They do catering as well. They have some vegetarian options to choose from. You can even build your own sandwich. Salad bar can be purchased on its own.  I decided to go with the spinach veggie wrap. You get a choice of chips or a selection of fruit. I chose the fruit. I ordered a small drink and was given a 24 ounce paper cup! That's pretty big for a small! Nevertheless you are given a number and then told to sit anywhere.  The place is pretty big so there's plenty of room to sit. Drinks are self serve through machines and you can get whatever you need to go with them. By the time I got my drink my food was already at my table.  My wrap was good but I noted that the edges were dry. The hostess came around to see how I was doing and I mentioned that to her. I later learned that they toast their pita bread which gives it the hard edge to it. She offered to get me another one but I declined since I was pretty full from this one.   I would say this food is average as a whole. This deli is located near Aldi's in the block of Northway shops which is still not completed. They also have an online menu which I haven't tried.",

Actually the food was made before I could complete the \"pickup\" order.  They were in a training shift and Melissa was training Rory and they were so courteous. Not only to the guests that were forming in line , but to each other. The restaurant was clean and constantly wiped down by several of other smiling workers. Great job you guys.  You rock. Can't wait to try something else.  Oh yeah I got the half turkey muffuletta and this thing is huge!! And delish!",

So I wasn't sure if was to order there only. Nonetheless, duh you can order at the touchpad station or just go right up and order at counter. I got the salmon salad. And I must say, I loved it. The salmon was very fresh, as well as the greens. The salmon was cut in chunks--different for me because I am used to a whole salmon on top. But nonetheless was still good I did order it to go. Also, it is a very nice portion. The person who took my order was very kind and patient with me. I was having a lot of dazed and confused  moments trying to figure out what I wanted. So I appreciate that! I really do hope this business does very well, and does not get overlooked. I look forward to checking it out again, and next time i think I will try a panini and soup.",
