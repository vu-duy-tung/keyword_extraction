    "text": "I saw the signs in Robinson and thought I would give this place a try.  When I went in I first wondered if this was a family owned and operated or a chain.  I see on here that it is a chain.  I walked in the door and a very pretty girl with long dark hair who KNEW she was pretty was at the hostess desk.  I walked up and she just stood there.  I asked do I seat myself or do you seat.  She picked up the menu and walked away towards the dining room.  I followed, she put me at a table and walked away.  She wasn't nearly pretty as she thought she was to have such an attitude.  Thats why I thought it was family owned.  I figured daddy owned the place and she HAD to work there.  I was seated for a while before a waitress showed up.  When she did she was very friendly and apologetic for the wait.  I ordered, the food came out in an appropriate time.  It was awesome!  One of the best sandwiches I have ever had and the portions were more than large.  My waitress did stop back, not too much attention but could have been more.  I did see a LOT of people moving around the restaurant wearing YARD shirts but didn't see too much attention to the customers.  Bottom line, the food was great but the service was slow and the first impression at the entrance was a HUGE turn off!  I'll go back, give them the benefit of the doubt that they are new and trying to get into a routine but unless they adjust the attitude of the hostess and speed up the wait staff they won't survive.  Amazes me that people who work for tips ignore the customer.  My check was around $18 and I left a $7 tip... the waitress was friendly just slow service.  Step it up guys, there's lots of other places in Robinson to get a meal!",

    "text": "So a lot of people raved about The Yard. I have  always wanted to go, and ended up going there for brunch for my friends birthday.    Market Square Parking is a beast in itself. I would park on 5th ave and consider walking. The location of the resturant is in a great spot and it will be crazy in the summer.   This place does have stairs so if you do not fancy steps or have a hard time.. now you know.   Food/Service: i ordered the french toast with nutella sauce. I was not too impressed with my food. The toast was a bit too dry for my liking and there wasnt enough nutella to provide a moist texture when you chew. The tater tots and sauage were good. However the presentation of my plate was very well laid out. I dont like when chefs just throw food on your plate. But i would come back for the drinks. Our server did very well becuase we had a party of 11 and she was very attentive.    The bottomless Mimosas is what atteacted me to this place and it was awesome. I would recommend this place for that! Oh and their nectar nugget beer is great.",

It's upstairs with a good size bar with lots of beer on tap.   The Bloody Mary was meh. During brunch hours they have unlimited Bloody Mary bar and a separate unlimited mimosa bar, but I had a single Bloody Mary.  It was so plain! I was disappointed beyond belief. They used Tabasco Bloody Mary mix, vodka, old bay rim, a lemon and a lime. Literally poured the mix out of the bottle into my glass. No love in the mix at all!! There are so many amazing restaurants downtown that know how to make a Bloody Mary, it's not worth it to go here. And it was 8$ on top of it all.   The chorizo omelette.. Pretty tasty!  I liked it but it was a little cold, same with the hash browns.  But it all had flavor, so I ignored the temperature.  The beers were perfect. Great temperature and tasted fresh.    It was a clean restaurant and worth a second trip. It's not the cheapest and there are better places to go, but this place is new.  Will give it another chance a little later.",

    "text": "I visited The Yard for the first time for a business lunch yesterday and I'm still not totally sure what I think.  The location is on the second floor of the building, with a dark stairway leading up.  If anyone in your party has any mobility challenges, this is not the place for you. It was packed, even before the noon rush, but we were able to get a seat without a reservation.  The service was overly attentive, though I guess that I would prefer that to inattentive, particularly at the lunch hour when you're trying to get back to the office.  My dining companion was asked at least 3 times if she was done with her tomato soup (she was not!).  The check was on our table shortly after our entrees were delivered (I do not mind this for lunch, but it did feel like we were being pushed).  The food was fair.  It didn't knock my socks off, but it wasn't bad.  I had the Young Cheezy (minus the onions).  The bread was nicely toasted and held up well.  For a place that specializes in grilled cheeses, they sure skimp on the cheese (I noticed other reviews mentioning this).  The chorizo and potato hash on the sandwich had good flavor, but the chorizo could've been cooked a bit longer to give it better texture.  The grilled cheeses all come with tomato soup and potato chips.  The tomato soup was good, but the vessel that it is served in is rather small.  It is too narrow to effectively dip your grilled cheese - which is the best part of grilled cheese and tomato soup!  There are several flavors of potato chips to pick from.  I chose the garlic parm.  The chips were good (obviously homemade), but really, they just shook a canister of Kraft parmesan cheese over them and called it a day.  There was no hint of garlic whatsoever, and the cheese was only on the very top few chips.  The entrees are creatively named, but awkward.  Who wants to order a \"Smack Yo Mama\" in front of a business contact or boss?  Since this place is still pretty new, I'll definitely try it again.  I also wish that they offered a more simple grilled cheese as an option. Sometimes that would hit the spot!",

    "text": "Overall, this was a highly enjoyable experience.  I love the idea of featuring gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches.  There were so may options for the grilled cheese, that it was almost overwhelming, but I was able to pick through and come up with a top choice.  What was had at my table was- the big che-bowski, the mac attack, the poppin' my collar, and the smack yo mamma.  I personally ordered the smack yo momma.  The flavors were all there and a great combo, but unfortunately, the chicken seemed a little on the dry side.  Luckily, the bbq sauce covered it up, for the most part.  My friend who ordered the mac attack, was disappointed in the small showing of Bacon Lardons in her sandwich - she was able to confidently identify two small pieces of bacon.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their sandwiches.  We all stuck with the homemade chips, which were what you can expect from homemade chips - better than from a bag.  The restaurant itself had very trendy decor - Edison bulbs, exposed wood plank walls and ceiling structure in a dark gray/black color with a chalkboard special menu.  I was surprised by the amount of space and number of tables considering it's on the second floor of the building.   One of the oddest things about the restaurant is the location of the bathrooms.  You have to walk past the kitchen and dodge servers with food to be taken out to get to them.  It was a little awkward and uncomfortable.  Overall, it was a solid dinner and I wouldn't hesitate to go back there.",

While 3 fries technically does count as French fries on the sandwich, it's not nearly what I expected for a 14$ sandwich. As well as that the \"strips of steak\" was actually a singular chunk of pre-sliced steak that I guess they didn't bother to finish cutting through. It tasted more like a grill and nothing like actual meat. I'm not sure if I somehow offended the chef or if maybe he was having a stroke when making mine, but this is beyond sad. There's pictures below of what the sandwich looked like when it got here and what the actually steak looked like. It smells about as bad as it looks too.",

    "text": "The Yard is a pretty great place! All of the experiences I've had there have been great. The first time I went I actually visited the Shadyside location. I had the Mac Attack grilled cheese and it was pretty good! All of the grilled cheese sandwiches come tomato soup on the side and your choice of fries. I chose the sweet potato fries and they were delicious! The sweet potato fries come with a delicious cinnamon butter dipping sauce, it's so yummy! The tomato soup is basically marinara sauce, could've been a little creamier and less dense.   The second time I went to the Yard was the downtown location. It's a nice location and I've tried to come here before twice but it's crazy busy on the weekends! My friend and I shared the Mac Attack balls as an appetizer and THEY WERE AWESOME! It comes with this great sriracha mayo dipping sauce, which is amazing. For dinner, I had the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia grilled cheese and it was really good actually! They were a little stingy with the steak but the beer cheese and red peppers had a great flavor! For dessert we shared the Cause We Got High dessert and boy was it good! It comes on Texas toast with nutella, peanut butter and bananas on the inside, deep fried and then topped with marshmallows and chocolate sauce. I'm glad I split it because it was huge!   The servers are really nice and I've always had great service here. The food always seems to come out very fast too! I went this past Monday and had the Mac Attack again and this time is was even better than the first time!   Come check out this place!",

However, when my husband ordered a cup of soup, the hostess came to the table to tell the party that there was a reservation coming in and they would have to leave.  I have since heard from The Yard as you can see below my review. They explained the situation. Perhaps they could have offered another table for those that wanted to stay, but they were very communicative throughout the evening. I appreciate their response and will consider a return trip to experience more their menu options.",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of grilled cheese.  That statement is an accurate one.  Grilled cheese is such a simple meal to create and comforting, especially since we are getting into those colder months right now.  What is such a simple comfort food The Yard has taken and created some amazing, unique, and quite tasty twists that definitely comfort.  I had been milling around downtown for a good part of the morning debating on where to meet my friend for an early lunch.  I walked around Market Square inspecting all that there was to offer.  Including the ordinary chains that dot our American landscape and the local favorites of Pittsburgh.  Unfortunately for me, I was Primanti-ed out for once (I know, that sounds sacrilegious).  So I meandered over towards the Fifth Ave side of the Square and was happy to see that this place was open and more than delighted to see exactly the type of food on the menu.  Once my friend showed up it did not take much persuasion to convince her that The Yard was going to be our spot for the afternoon.  We showed up at a decent hour, no wait time to be seated and less wait time to have our drink orders taken.  Our server was gracious and gave us time to look over the menus as it was our first time here.  Once we stopped giggling at some of the names on the menu, I mean come on, tell me the Young Cheesy isn't a funny name, we were ready to place our orders.  As we waited for our orders to be prepared I started to do the longneck view of the space.  It is surprisingly bigger than you would expect.  It looks narrow from the outside, but it is quite big on the inside.  The dining/bar space stretches the length of the building, making for some great space to have a meal, drink a brew and maybe catch a game on one of the televisions.    Once the food arrived I didn't pay much attention to my surroundings, I had to concentrate.  I had ordered The Mac Attack.  Spiral mac n' cheese between to slices of Texas toast with cheese.  Mixed into the spiral mac were these delicious burst of bacon lardons.  Cooked perfectly to pack a punch of flavor.  Eating this beast was not an easy task as you can imagine.  I mean it is mac n' cheese on a grilled cheese.  A fork is needed to clean up after you make an effort.  Shall we talk about the tomato soup?  Yes!  That tomato soup is house made and it is so delicious.  I wanted another bowl of that after I finished it off.  I just wish I wasn't so greedy with it and saved some for the end of the meal.  Dipping this particular grilled cheese is not a suggested task to do, you will lose some of the filling of the sandwich and that is not such a good idea, take it from me.  Along with the soup, I decided to upgrade mine to include fries instead of chips.  I got mine with the garlic parmesan dusting which gave me an extra bit of flavor.  Silly me ended up with cold fries as I was too busy with the grilled cheese and soup.  But they still tasted quite good.  On the smaller side for fries, but non-the-less they were good.  Beers on tap vary dependent on the season.  I suggest trying one of the vanilla stouts, a good mix for the variety of tastes you will be having and possibly a good substitute for a dessert.  The only downside I have is that it can get rather noisy in here.  But I take the blame for that seeing how I showed up during a Steelers game.  **I am happy to say that the front picture (at the time of me reviewing this) is the what you see when you view this business.**",

I thought I had heard some positives about the place but I'm guilty of believing my own half-truths. The beer selection was mostly local but it seems as if it's mostly off season(slightly). It is February but seeing Christmas beer on the menu told me right away that this place is for a different crowd. A crowd made of mostly suburbanites and out of touch downtowners looking for an after work burger and beer. I'm not that. Maybe you aren't either...?  This place isn't awful but it's also not really anything more than an Eat'n Park with beer. The wine selection is very low grade and their cocktails aren't worth noting. I may continue to frequent here for the $4.50 Rhinegeist Bubbles during happy hour but I'm not sure I want to smell of booze AND frier grease for my evening class.",

I got a Moscow mule to start and it was not very good, Primanti's on the other side of a Market Square makes a way better one! I also hate places that serve chips as a side, not only that but you had to pay extra to switch it to something else. I got the Frank The Tank sandwich. While the flavor was good of buffalo chicken dip, there was only one onion ring on the sandwich that you couldn't even taste. It just felt like a big blob of buffalo chicken dip on toasted bread, nothing worth paying $12 for! I was pretty disappointed with the place. It took a lot to convince my friends to go and we all left knowing we should have just gone to Primanti's.",

We made reservations for 1:30pm and when we finally were parked and walked over to Market Square, we were quickly seated by our hostess.  For being a late afternoon lunch on Saturday, the restaurant was fairly packed.  I noticed they had a mimosa/bloody Mary bar, but I unfortunately did not partake in it.    We ordered the pub pretzels for an appetizer.  They came as 4 decently sized pieces of bread with a honey mustard and cheese dipping sauce. My wife is a huge pub pretzel fan and these hit the spot for her.  They came out warm and nicely salted and had a nice fresh fluffy taste to them.  For our meal, I ordered the \"Mother of Dragon\" which had chicken, cheese, and some jalapeno peppers.  It had a good level of heat and the meal was extremely filling between the sandwich, small side of tomato soup, and homemade chips with garlic parmesan seasoning.  Besides the garlic seasoning on the chips being a little weak (not necessarily a bad thing for my breath), it was a well put together meal.  My wife ordered the \"Smack Yo Mama\" meal with wedding soup and chips.  The sandwich was just as amazing as its name and came with shredded chicken with BBQ sauce and cheese.    The meal was very filling and very tasty.  They have an ideal location being in the heart of Market Square.  The place has a very trendy hip atmosphere, and I can see why this place has been fairly popular.  I Would definitely recommend giving this place a try.  The prices are fairly reasonable as well for downtown dining.",

I will probably give them another chance, but there are better places.  It's also very noisy inside.",

I have been to other grilled cheese joints such as Melt in Cleveland that were a million times better. Their other food is pretty good though, I often find myself getting the yard walker which is very delicious. The food isn't anything special but it's a fun place to come to with friends or to watch a Steelers game at the bar.",

    "text": "Hard to believe that 3 grilled cheese sandwiches, four beers, one appetizer and an order of lettuce wraps cost 93 dollars with tip. In addition,the service was extremely slow and the food quality was fair. Ordered a Sam Adams on nitro to be told ten minutes later they were out of it. My yard of beer, listed at  ten bucks was listed on the check for 11.  When questioned why this was, I was told the glasses were changed from 32 to 34 ounces but the charge would be reduced to the menu price. I was then asked to hand the waiter the menu so adjustments could be made. How many customers were charged an extra buck without their knowledge? Appetizer of fried Mac n cheese balls took thirty minutes from order to table!  Restaurant not overly busy at 2pm so what was the deal? Disappointed to say the least. Ten dollars to park made it even more costly as we were there nearly 2 hours for lunch, with no wait to be seated. You gotta really like grilled cheese sandwiches to justify the expenditure.",

I ordered the \"Frank The Tank\" which was shredded chicken, shredded cheddar, provolone, red hot, and onions on grilled bread with the sides that come with it: tomato soup and home made potato chips.  The food arrived hot and looked great.  But, that's where it ends.  The sandwich was so salty that I couldn't finish it.  When I cut it open the sauce ran over the plate/breadboard it was served on and all over the table - so the signs were there.  Ok, my bad for ordering a red hot sauce sandwich - I'll accept that.  But worse was the tomato soup which tasted like the plastic bag that it probably came from and the chips were translucent and greasy.  The ones that weren't were stale and awful - I even had to spit one out.  I never do that kind of thing.  Anyway, I left feeling unsatisfied.  I have heard that their brunch is good.  Maybe I will give that a shot sometime. Maybe.",

Started off with the \"yard-chos\", which are just Yard's clever name for nachos.  Got some generic bagged chips with some gloppy \"beer cheese\" and some decent pico de gallo on top.  Nothing special.  I ordered one of their giant grilled cheese sandwiches that had a Big Mac type of burger concoction in it.  The sandwich looked great, but it got to me lukewarm at best, maybe it sat in the pickup window too long.  The stuffed grilled cheese sandwich is a great idea (Melt in Cleveland, OH does an excellent version of them).  Yard's version melts the cheese while grilling the bread and then stuffs the sandwich, which makes the sandwich a little lackluster.  Great concept, average execution at best.",

I had been meaning to check out the Shadyside location for awhile so when I heard they were opening a Market Square location, it seemed like the perfect place to grab lunch on a workday. The menu had so many delicious-sounding options, it was hard to choose what to eat. I decided on The Jerk - a pulled pork & slaw grilled cheese. The taste was good but the slaw was too watery and made it such a mess to eat that I ended up resorting to a knife and fork. Unfortunately, the tomato soup that was served on the side was so disgusting that I ended up taking only one bite. It tasted like a bowl of smoky marinara.... which I suppose could be good if you are into that, but it isn't tomato soup. I would still go back and try the other grilled cheese sandwiches on the menu and would like to check it out for happy hour as they have a lot of great beers on tap.",

The Asian-inspired slaw is what made my sandwich - nice and sweet and the vegetables had the crunch and freshness that lightened up the somewhat heavy sandwich.  I liked the tomato soup, but I didn't care for the chips which were a bit overcooked.  Next time I come back, I will pursue my options to swap out the chips, as other reviewers have indicated that the sides can be substituted.  The beer list was very comprehensive, with a variety of styles and a good representation of both local and national microbrews.  Friendly staff - had some good conversation with them about the various brews and microbreweries.  The main thing I will change next time is to learn about the different sides.",

Began to order a few things, that were on the menu, and the bartender was looking at us like we were from another planet and said \"did u even see that on the menu?\" Uhm. Rude. I could go on with the disappointment but hoping my experience is better next time, if there is a next time.",

Waited 30 minutes for my burger and my husbands. Mine was raw on the inside and couldn't eat it. My husbands burger wasn't what he ordered. The manager was very apologetic and offered to try and make it right, but we were done. First time ever I have walked out. The manager gave us a gift card but I doubt I will be back.",

Mac-n-Cheese is their staple so when in Rome 4) took a chance and let our waiter (who didn't know Ron Swanson too well & we're cutting him a break) pick my lunch! Ellie order a corn dog with a small side of Mac-n-Cheese and my boy got the The Big Chu-bowski... he is also drinking his 1st Moscow Mule... I opted for a BlackBerry Kentucky mule... YUM! 5) granddaughter got her kid menu wet and was immediately given a new one (Nana bonus points) 6) sandwiches are perfection! Mine was the Caprese with a balsamic reduction... all sandwiches come with tomato soup and fresh home fries! 7) and to think we almost went to the Greek restaurant, which is highly rated... 8) Mac-n-Cheese OMG delicious! 9) perfect timing of round 2 Moscow mules... my son is a fan (of course... mom will never steer you wrong -shout out to Texas- 10) thank you to the Yard & our waiter, Marcus! The new guy!!! Now it's time for Santa's village....",

We ordered the 'Poppin my collar', the Crab Sandwich and one more and they were all DELICOUS!!!  My potato chips were slightly burned, but that was ok.

This place has great service, great food, and an amazing atmosphere! I had order the flat bread with buffalo sauce, hot sauce, ranch and chicken. I highly recommended that as well as the mac attack balls or the buffalo chicken dip with the pita chips. It's a little on the expensive side but well worth it. Big portions and you get so much that the pay is worth how much you get for the meal. Would recommended if your board of the same old places or just wanna try something new. They have so many options and so much to choose from even there brunch menu is decently big",

There's so many options for different types of grilled cheeses, with choices for vegetarians, meat lovers, seafood lovers, etc., and everything is reasonably priced.   I ordered the cheesy caprese with tomato soup and a side of cajun spiced chips. Personally, I didn't love the sandwich simply because it was super buttery and I prefer healthier options and don't like food being too oily. However, the perfectly toasted sandwich and flavorful chips made the meal a guilty pleasure, and I definitely want to go back and try some of the bolder flavors. The soup was also delicious and on the thicker side. My friends ordered sides of mac n cheese and sweet potato fries and especially loved the cinnamon dip the latter came with. This isn't somewhere I would frequent often just because of how heavy the meal was - otherwise, a great place to try out new sandwiches.",

Other members in my group ordered the Buffy Mac attack, the always Sunny in Philly, and smack yo mama. No complaints were heard so I'm thinking those are safe bets as well.   The yard is also known for their \"almost\" bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's. There's a bloody Mary bar where you can put in almost anything you'd want! Pretty cool.",

Now who doesnt like grilled cheese sandwiches?  We ordered the chicken wings with a jerk seasoning dry rub and  a standard grilled cheese sandwhich. The sandwhiches all come with tomoatoe soup, but we said hold that soup not a fan of tomato soup in general.  The grilled cheese sandwiches were a little much, with combos and ingredients that just weren't really that appealing. They dont have a standard grilled cheese. Meaning bread and cheese. So we asked them to hold all of the hooplah and give us a standard sandwhich.  The wings with that seasoning were on point. They were sweet and salty at the same time. The fries were so dissapointing, they were soft and floppy. Who like floppy fries? Not me. Lastly, the grilled cheese was just ok.",

It's not a large space but adequate with a long bar and tables throughout the long but narrow space. TV's are all along the bar area, service was friendly, efficient, and fast.  I like that our server actually asked us if we liked what we ordered.  This used to be a usual thing but not so much anymore.  My husband wasn't going to complain about his beer option but since she asked if he liked it, he had to be honest and said \"not so much\".  Well, our server promptly said \"no problem\" and she'd get him something else.  She insisted.  How nice is that?!    I ordered a bloody mary and requested celery.  It was ok, nothing too special about it but oh, how I did appreciate the celery with it. On to the ordering.  The menu has lots of grilled cheese options so we both selected one of them.  I opted for the mac-n-cheese grilled cheese.  They all come with tomato soup and chips.  The sandwich was good but so very messy with the mac-n-cheese oozing out everywhere.  I think I would rather have had just the mac-n-cheese without the bread.  The tomato soup was good but was not a very large portion at all.  Chips were good -- I ordered them with parmesan cheese on them. The noise level was a little louder than average -- not bad but it was filled with Penguin hockey jerseys and it was a bar/restaurant and everyone was happy so it was to be expected that it was not a quiet venue.   All in all this was a decent place to grab a bite and brew.",

    "text": "Decent lunch, if slightly over priced per plate at the quality level I saw on my first visit. Nothing really jumps out on the menu, it's like a nice Applebee's I guess. I did the caprese with chicken for I think $16. The staff seems really friendly however and they have free, easy to access Wi-Fi available which is a plus at lunchtime.   My only issue was with the blaring music coming from the PA system. Even through my headphones on at full volume I could hear what I only assume was Mumford and his kids screaming, warbling and carrying on over my podcast. Not what I'd call lunchtime volume.  When the song ended I heard the gentleman next to me sigh audibly to which I said \"big difference huh?\" \"It's like the cabin pressure dropped in here,\" he replied. Before I could agree the sonic assault resumed. I gestured for the check a bit quicker than planned as a result.",

She said the French toast was very good.  My burger was cooked right and was good. The fries were a let down as they seem to use powdered cheese. Our waitress seemed like she had better things to do because about 20 seconds after we sat down she asked what we wanted to order. I hadn't even had time to open the beer list (they have 39 taps). We asked for more time and she seemed annoyed by it. I would go back for the food and he beer but if was sat in her section again I would just go sit at the bar instead.",

The difference is the variation of grilled cheese sandwiches available for dining! My sandwich had pepper jack,cheese, jalapenos, grilled chicken - perfect! Then the tomatoes soup was great - on a cold day (what the doctor ordered). I opted for fries instead of potato chips which was good! All in all, a great meal for the price! The combo of all 3 items is such a winner! I have to add / I don't like tomato soup - until I tried it at the Yard! Thanks for the wonderful meal during the dangerously low temperatures in Pittsburgh! Will definitely visit again to try a different grilled cheese combo!",

They take two slices of bread and put each one on the griddle with your cheese and let them get somewhat hot - then they mash the other ingredients inside and smash the sandwich together.  My point being grilled cheeses should be hot and guey cheese. These aren't. The cheese was only melted on the outside and the tomatoes inside were COLD!  I've also had the lettuce wraps - again nothing memorable.  My point: I can make a better grilled cheese sandwich at home and save myself $10!",

I got a huge pour of house wine for only $4.  To order, a friend and I split the Mac n cheese balls and Bavarian pretzels. They were good but a huge grease fest. I wrapped my pretzels in napkins and within seconds the napkins were saturated with grease.  I would like to try the grilled cheese some time out of sheer curiosity, but they, too, looked like grease with side of grease chips.  Basically this seems like a place I would have enjoyed in my 20s when I was out all night, wasted off my a$$, looking for some obscenely unhealthy food to ram down at 230am.  That said, I heard brunch is great, particularly due to their $15 bottomless mimosas.  I would try the place one more time for brunch or to say I had one of the ridiculous grilled cheese, but that's likely the end of it for me.",

I had to send two Mike Bison Burgers back to the kitchen because they were raw in the center (not undercooked; they weren't cooked at all).  The manager apologized,  let me know that he talked to the kitchen staff, let me know that there was a co-owner in the back (though he never came out), and gave me two appetizer gift cards.  On a positive note, the server was very good. Hopefully the co-owner had a better lunch than I did!\"",

Let's just start by saying if you want to feel rushed and not enjoy quality brunch time with family/friends, this is the place for you.  While the food was good I was extremely unhappy with the service. Fantastic that you can turn around someone's food in like 5 minutes but that doesn't mean we like to eat and leave within 30. I watched the waitress come over to the table next to me and tell them that they had a lot of people waiting at least 15 minutes for tables. So she essentially asked them to leave when they were trying to enjoy some bottomless mimosas.   The hostess then came to our table questioning who sat us at the table and proceeded to tell us that they had a reservation at the table and plenty of people waiting for tables. At this point it was clear this is how this place turns over tables so we just left. The chances that we return is very slim. I planned a brunch because I wanted to spend time with my friends but instead I felt rushed. I checked my watch and we were only there for an hour so I'm not sure why they thought it was ok to make us feel like we needed to leave because we overstayed.",

All of the waiters and waitresses were very friendly but, truthfully, I don't see it as worth the money that we spent on the meal. My caprese grilled cheese didn't have one of the ingredients that was listed as having on the menu, and half of my sandwich had almost no toppings on it. It's a nice space with quick service but I don't think it'll be on our list of top places to return.",

    "text": "We chose The Yard because (a) the menu looked good and (b) the wait for a table was zero minutes.  We started with the buffalo chicken dip, referred to as \"I Dip, You Dip, We Dip,\" which was good, but nothing better than what I've had at Super Bowl parties. The chips that accompanied the dip were your basic restaurant-style tortilla chips. The dish itself was small. The four of us finished it off quickly. We easily could have ordered another appetizer.  I ordered a side salad which included the standard lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber (very large slices of cucumber, I might add). The ranch was the real winner, as it so often is with these types of salads.  For my entree, I went with \"The Wac Arnold,\" which is essentially a patty melt: two beef patties, cheese, special sauce, lettuce, tomato, pickle and onion...all served between two slices of Texas toast.  The patties were much smaller than I envisioned. The cheese disappeared among the mix, and the special sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking.  It wasn't bad, but I definitely wouldn't order it again. The small side serving of fries was more or less forgettable.  The service was great. The restaurant was a bit warm and stuffy (which says a lot coming from this cold-blooded human).  All in all, it was an average experience.",

My boyfriend got the mac & cheese grilled cheese and I got the chicken and bacon. You also get fries and tomatoe soup with your order. We also ordered the beer on tap that they were running a special for, and it was great! Our service was great and I would definitely recommend. The only small thing I'd say is the tomato soup tastes more like a sauce. If you ever had 5 cheese marinara sauce at Olive Garden, the flavor is identical! The taste is good, but not something I would drink straight. Overall, delicious and not a bad price.. Thanks!",

But for the price, having that and tater tots and soup was an amazing deal. I liked my sandwich, but the tomato soup was incredible.  It's thick and oily and clearly homemade, which I appreciate. I also liked how you could get flavors on your potatoes such as garlic parm, Cajun, or Old Bay. I, like all good millennial, love customization.    Because it was my friend's birthday, we also got a free dessert called \"Because I Was High.\" That was not my favorite. Deep fried bread with Nutella, peanut butter, chocolate, and bananas was too heavy and sickly sweet to be properly enjoyed. I would definitely have picked one of their extensive beers, Blood Mary bar, or fun appetizers before spending money on dessert.",

Can it get any better? But if those aren't your thing, they also have a nice selection of beers on draft.   This location at Market Square is not the largest so I would recommend making a reservation for busy times of the day. The waiters, bartenders and other staff are always friendly. I've never had a bad experience here. The mac and cheese bites are a great app to order before your meal. And I am a big fan of the Cheesy Capresey sandwich.

The yard is a cool place unlike anywhere I've ever been. As a lover of grilled cheese I thought I found the holy grail of restaurants.  In recent months I have gone here several times for brunch and dinner. And one thing I have noticed always stayed True upon leaving this establishment: a cringing stomach ache that is unlike anything I've ever felt before. Whether it is the Mac attack, French toast, or pancakes I always leave here feeling terrible. And not the \"I feel guilty that was a days worth of calories in one sitting\" terrible. Like physically terrible. My gut is in shambles after even eating half a meal here. The food is good. Definitely satisfying when you're looking for a greasy cheat meal filled with cheese and other goodies. But it is honestly not worth the sick feeling the food gives you. Perhaps it's a little too unhealthy ( never thought I would ever say that because I heart junk food). Awesome atmosphere. Fanstastic service. Intriguing menu; one of a kind. But the feeling afterward? Not worth it for me but definitely does NOT stop me from coming here for a good time and some awesome beer selections as well.",

This grilled cheese was so much better than the last one I had here. The pierogies were delicious and tasted amazing with the caramelized onions and sauerkraut. I was also worried the kielbasa would be huge, but they were were small bite sized pieces throughout. The flavor combination together surprisingly worked really well. The cajun chips were also very flavorful and crunchy. Just tried a bit of the mac and cheese that had fallen out of my friend's sandwich and got little bits of bacon which were delicious.

    "text": "Grilled cheese. Cocktails. Great atmosphere, ambiance, and service. How can I not adore The Yard? I got to eat here for the first time a couple days ago, and it was incredible. There were sooooo many tempting things on The Yard's menu - but as great as their flatbreads, appetizers and burgers looked, I knew that I had to get a grilled cheese during my first meal here.  I made the right call! While my dining buddy got a tasty shrooms grilled cheese, I stuffed my face with an incredible fried green tomatoes grilled cheese. (Seriously, where else can you find that combination?) The addition of bacon to the cheesy mix did a lot to help balance out the tangy taste of the green tomatoes - plus, the bacon and green tomatoes together added a nice crunch to the entire sandwich; nothing was overdone by any means, but the texture was perfect given the ingredients involved. Just to top it all off, the entire stack automatically came with a side of thick tomato soup for dipping and eating; that's all the proof I need to know that this place knows their grilled cheese!  And as if coming with the dipping bowl wasn't enough, dining partner and I alike could order another side with our sandwich and soup. While most meals typically come with chips here, there are plenty of substitution options if you're looking for something else. I opted for a super tasty stack of glazed green beans, which were fresh and ever-so-slightly crunchy - a wonderful thing, as many places overcook their green beans to the point of being mushy and \"blah\".  Literally the only thing that could have made our night better was dessert, but alas, we ended up drinking ours before we even finished our main courses, as we tried several different cocktails. Gin drinkers, get on in here and enjoy their gin cocktail. It's incredible. Just sayin'.  I know that I'll be here again soon, especially because they have some fantastic happy hour options that I won't want to miss out on. There's a lot more menu for me to try - food and cocktail alike!",

    "text": "We wanted to grab brunch before heading to the Steelers game and The Yard was conveniently located between our hotel and the stadium.   It opened at 10:00 am so we got there right then and were seated immediately. The brunch menu isn't extensive. There are about six dishes on it, but we could also order from the regular menu. The real star of the show? Bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's. The Bloody Mary's include vodka and then access to the Bloody Mary bar to craft your own. I ended up just ordering a single one and they prepared it for me. It hit the spot! My brother went for the mimosas and I'll assure you his glass was never empty.   For brunch, I split the biscuits and gravy with fried chicken on top. It came with a side of bacon, tater tots, and I also ordered some fruit to feel a little less guilty about the situation. The portion was definitely prime for splitting, so unless you're looking to be on the couch for the rest of the day, I'd suggest going that route! Others at our table got the snozzberry pancakes which was also quite shareable.   To top it off, there are plenty of TVs to catch a game and our waitress was very friendly and made our morning fun. All in all, it was just what we needed. I can definitely imagine hanging out here on another game day for some bottomless drinks and greasy food.",

All three of us had a beer from their extensive draft list.  I ordered from the brunch menu and had the chicken and waffles sliders.  A side of home fries accompanied the meal.  My meal was 12.00 which seemed a little pricey but it was excellent.  My two friends both had grilled cheese of some sorts and enjoyed theirs.    This is a great little bar with a fantastic location in Market Square.  I look forward to my next visit.  This would be a fantastic happy hour stop.  Keep up the good work.",

    "text": "First off this place is in Market Square, so unless you work in the city there is no reason to even set foot in this establishment. I was nearly in tears when I realized I was not going to be able to find a parking spot with a 50 meter walking distance. But, as Winston Churchill once said, \"if you're going through Hell, keep going\". And so with that I embarked on one of the greatest parking expeditions since Mallory's assault on Everest. After my 17th time circling the square I finally witnessed the birth of Jesus Christ, as a fellow patron began ever so slowly leaving one of their coveted \"parking spots\". The birth of the universe happened quicker than this person trying to leave the parking spot. Now friends what I'm about to tell you will send chills down your spine. There are some that describe restaurant kitchens as organized chaos. This place is not that. As I walked to the men's room I looked left and saw the shit show that was the kitchen. There was more food on the ground and on the burners than actually on fucking plates. One deckhand was even texting the night away on his non-bacteria laced cell phone. DID YOU KNOW? Hand washing is the number one deterrent of food borne illnesses. This place didn't. I decided to continue on. Entering the bathroom I nearly spat blood when I realized it was cleaner than the kitchen. Keep calm, I thought. No need to make a scene. I walked out and stumbled back into my seat. One word to describe the food here. Grease. I ordered a plain Jane cheeseburger, asked for medium-well, it came back well-done. Obviously, Marco Pierre White wasn't working the kitchen that night. There was enough oil on the potato chips that it began borderline bending the laws of molecular chemistry. Here I thought, there are scientist working on breakthroughs refracting light to achieve camouflage and this fucking place had already discovered it. Should have just gone to the Mcdonalds down the street. Would have saved $20.",

    "text": "UPDATE: We went back here after a week, much better experience, no soup spilled and they had beer! The manager (Wayne) remembered me from the previous visit and asked about the soup, so that was a good start. I had the Jerk grilled cheese this time, it was advertised as spicy, so I was a little worried, but there wasn't much heat to it at all. I didn't like the fact that the pork was hot and the pineapple was cold. It would have made a huge difference if they heated up the pineapple prior to putting it on the sandwich, but it was good. Big beer selection, good food and good service. The below review was from my first trip, read if you dare!  Don't cry over spilled soup?   We went out to this new location in Market Square on the day that they opened around 11:30. Immediate disappointment ensued when they weren't able to sell alcohol yet (we were told they would have their liquor license straightened out by 4 for happy hour). We don't need alcohol to have a good time, but they had the 36 draft system right in front of us, so it was just a big tease!   Anyway, the menu had some very interesting names on it for the grilled cheese sandwiches. I went with the smack yo mama, a grilled cheese with caribbean chicken and jack cheese. After waiting a little while, the food arrived....but as it arrived, the server spilled a whole cup of their tomato soup all over my jeans/shoes. Their serving plates were just wooden rectangles with handles - no lips or indentations for the soup or chip cups to stay on the board - I don't blame the server, I blame the one who settled on these as a good idea to serve hot soup on. I was less than amused, but the manager came over and said he would comp my meal - which ended up being fine since the soup came out!  What gets better (or worse) - the one bartender poured a bottled beer (Evil Genius - Evil Eye PA) into a glass, gave it to the manager who served it to a gentleman at a different table. I asked if we were able to purchase bottles, was told no, then asked why they served a bottle him. They told me the bottle was for the cook to make their beer cheese out of. We could clearly see the gentleman at the table drinking the beer and the bartender denied ever opening it. Don't know why he could have one but nobody else could, but it doesn't look good as a business for you to do that in front of customers and it's even worse if it's illegal for you to do that.  Long story short - this was just not a good lunch, the service was great from the bartender and I do feel bad for the server, but it was just not a good experience. Maybe give this place some time for them to sort out the kinks and I'll edit this review.",

A friend had made a reservation for a large party for a birthday they told her she would have the entire bar area reserved for the party. . When we arrive they had two tables for us which was great, but the bar area was not cordoned off for us. It took 1 hour to take our drink orders then an additional 45 minutes for our drinks to arrive. After that it took 30 minutes to get the waiter to come back to even start taking our dinner orders. It's currently 8pm and we haven't even gotten our second round of drinks let alone our food. (We didn't even attempt to order an appetizer.)One of which was a bottle of wine. We have eaten at The Yard on multiple occasions. It doesn't seem to me that they are equipped to handle a large party. 1 server for 20 ppl.

Well, I've tried the Yard twice now, and I must admit that I'm of mixed feelings about it.  Here's what they get right: great service, and pretty fast, too.  The sweet potato waffle fries and the accompanying cinnamon sugar butter are so, so delicious.  Sandwiches come with a small side of tomato soup, and though I have only been there twice, each time the soup tasted a bit different, as though they haven't quite landed on the recipe yet.  For the record, I preferred the first encounter, where it tasted almost like a roasted red pepper and tomato soup.  The second time it tasted like straight tomato, and it was a bit too acidic.  This, I suppose, is a good time to point out the really not so good, which is the bread situation.  Now, they use really nice, thick bread, which is a good start.  Where these grilled cheese sandwiches are missing the mark is the truly *grilled* part.  The bread comes out so dry that I suspect that it's actually toasted, not grilled.  I guess that's  good if you're watching calories and don't want your bread grilled in butter until it caramelizes the sugars in the bread and achieves that nice golden brown crust.  But friends, if I'm already ordering a sandwich with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg, I can tell you that I most assuredly am NOT coming here looking to cut calories.  Please grill the bread.  Like, greasy diner grill it.  Please.  That would make the entire experience that much closer to perfect and worth the price.",

There were chunks of chicken, a small amount of shredded gouda and a lot of slaw which just made it soggy. The sandwich didn't really hold together well and fell apart. The best part was the tomato soup ,which is a bit thicker but still tasty. I opted for the sweet potato fries which were extremely soggy and way too salty. The restaurant is loud-so just be aware of that if you're looking for a semi-quiet place for lunch-this is not it. They do have a decent beer selection which may be their saving grace-however I'm sure this location will always be packed due to being in Market Square.

One bite and I couldn't go back for more.  It was waaaayy too thick for my taste....think tomato sauce in a bowl.     I had the 'smack yo mama' grilled cheese which was pulled bbq chicken, beer cheese and onion straws.  I actually subbed out the onion straws for fries.  The bread was toasted perfectly, and I bit right in to some wonderful flavors.  My only complaint was that twice in the course of my lunch, I bit into hard pieces of gristle that shouldn't have made it anywhere into my sandwich.   By that point I was picking through my chicken so much, I wasn't enjoying it.     I also had the garlic Parmesan chips with the sandwich.   They were good but I would have liked more flavor.  Lastly, they bring your sandwich, chips and cup of soup out on this little wooden cutting board.  I personally think it's too small to hold everything and was struggling to cut my sandwich in half without knocking stuff off the board.   Regardless, they did a good job on redoing the space.  It's still an overall awkward space but it was much more comfortable and inviting than the last restaurant in the space.",

    "text": "The Yard in the city it's worth the trip for brunch. They have a nice little set up for a bloody Mary bar and also champagne mimosas. They have an offering of some brunch specials on Sunday. I got the sausage biscuits and gravy, tater tots and bacon. My meal was a bit cold and I asked the server if she could have the kitchen warm it up, she returned with a brand-new bowl full of food with extra sausage gravy and extra hot. I was thankful. My husband had the fried green tomato grilled cheese with a roasted red pepper aioli and greens. It came with a side of tomato soup. There are a lot of complaints about the tomato soup, I don't know what they are complaining about, it's not canned Campbell's, it's homemade and it's delicious. The interior is pretty cool, nice bar set up, nice comfy seats, and TVs for all of you sports fanatics.",

Their mac and cheese balls are simply delicious. I also love their chicken and waffles for brunch with an important caveat; the waffles taste like cardboard but the chicken is very tasty. I always ask to replace the waffles with french toast and the ensuing Chicken and French Toast is a very good brunch meal",

    "text": "I'm giving five stars because a) they have gluten free bread, so I can actually experience the menu, and b) they have lots of creative options.    The gluten-free bread isn't the most flavorful, and it's a little dry, but it works and it's not awful.  It's some kind of seed-y variety.  The menu has two sides, one entirely for grilled cheese and the other for typical food options.  The waitress asked us for our drink order as soon as we sat down, before we'd had time to look at anything.  The drink menu at the table didn't seem to have what my bf was looking for, and the waitress (who we later found out was new) didn't seem to have a clue, but he was able to clear it up with the bartender and get the drink he wanted.  The water was served in little mason jars, which was a nice touch.    The burgers and sandwiches are huge!  The how-the-hell-are-people-supposed-to-get-that-in-their-mouths kind.  We both (lol) ordered the Big Che-bowski grilled cheese with the garlic-parm chips, and all the grilled cheeses come with tomato soup for dipping.  The tomato soup reminded me of pasta sauce and was very tasty.  The chips weren't my favorite... But the soup helped tremendously.  The sandwich was two fried eggs, bacon, cheddar and Gouda, and one slice of tomato.  It was very good, although the eggs were hardly fried and I ended up with yolk everywhere.  It also could have used a couple leaves of arugula, or something green and fresh like that.  I'll try something different next time.  But there will be a next time!    The decor leaves a little but to be desired, personally.  It's a bit industrial and cold...  Maybe that will improve with time, since it is a brand new spot.",

    "text": "I was beyond disappointed in the downtown location. I've been to the Shadyside location and had nothing but a great experience. Completely different in Market Square.   My husband, toddler son and I stopped in while visiting the Christmas Market on Sunday afternoon. And my main thought about the place....if you're going to be the only grilled cheese restaurant in downtown then be moderately kid friendly! We've been to several other restaurants throughout the city and even directly in Market Square and it was easier to have a little kid with you. In fact, we've been to Pizziaolo several times with our toddler and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.   I immediately had to use the bathroom and took my son when we arrived. No changing table, despite plenty of space. And the bathroom was actually pretty messy.   Then we get to our order. We had to specifically ask for a kids menu after sitting down, but clearly we had a child with us so why not give it to us to begin with? Then we order milk from the kids menu which we got after our own drinks in an adult sized styrofoam cup filled halfway. Anyone with a kid will know that it's very difficult to let a 2-year old drink out of that size cup. Certainly not a kids cup. Then we order him a plain grilled cheese, from the kids menu, and it was exactly the same size as my order. The bread was huge! Good for anyone wanting to avoid paying $9 for a plain grilled cheese...just get the kids meal for $5. But terrible for a little kid! Why even have a kids menu? The homemade chips were good and I enjoyed my own grilled cheese but the bad parts of the meal overshadow the actual taste of my food.   I hate to make this all about my kid but we have been to plenty of trendy restaurants in the last 2 years with him and had no experiences like this. I would have expected this from somewhere like Le Mont but we took him there in May and it was fantastic. A grilled cheese place should cater to all ages. Won't be back.",

On my previous visits I had the Wang Chung Tonight sandwich (BBQ Chicken, Asian Slaw, Gouda), the Imperial Swine flatbread (BBQ Pork, Bacon, Gouda) - can anyone sense a trend?  Today I had the Mac Attack, amazingly light balls of mac and cheese, breaded and deep-fried with a creamy sriracha sauce. Also a cup of their remarkable housemade tomato soup. I also attempted a dessert called \"Cause We Got High\", which combines peanut butter, Nutella, bananas, Texas toast and marshmallow in a way that can only have been concocted while in that state.  The only reason this lost a star is because of today's overly attentive waitstaff. I know I'm a curmudgeon, but: 1) don't ask me how I'm enjoying a dish two minutes after you've already asked me; 2) don't bring me my check before asking, since I might like dessert; and 3) don't pick up every item on my table as I put them down (sugar packet, napkin, napkin wrapper). It's annoying.",

The pulled chicken was good on the sandwich but I was disappointed in the gouda cheese.  Rather than having a slice or slices of gouda they had put shredded gouda on the sandwich and not much of it.  I could taste a hint of it every once in a while which wasn't so bad since the chicken and the slaw were tasty but for a grilled cheese place, I would've thought there'd be a bit more cheese to the sandwich.  The slaw on the sandwich wasn't the creamy type which I was happy about.  I'm not a fan of mayo based slaw.  It was very well flavored and seasoned and complemented the chicken very well.    The chips were fresh and crispy and a perfect portion.  I was not a fan of the tomato soup...it was more like a thick sauce than a soup and I had about 2 spoons of it but didn't finish it.",

I wasn't even jealous of all of my friends eating their grilled cheese sandwiches because it was so good! The lettuce and veggies were extremely fresh, and it was a large serving that includes toasted pita, too. I also loved the dressing, a refreshing and light lemony-mint dressing.

Everything was pretty great at that point. We had the chips and dip with our drinks and watched some really good games on. The restaurant was not overly crowded. A good amount of people were leaving we when arrived. We ordered our food about 15 after 2. We didn't get our food until 10 til 3, so we were starving and a little upset. We only had 2 people in our party and there were couples who arrived after us that ate and left before we got food lol. Our server was nice but honestly my boyfriend's monster of dragons was super soggy from where it had been sitting for awhile and it  was just not good. we won't be returning here for a long time after our experience today.",

The special sauce tasted like sweet and sour sauce and it just didn't belong on the grilled cheese. The Mac and cheese was very good though along with the poutine fries. My apple Pi drink was a bit too sweet for me as well. My husband really liked his though. He had the grilled cheese with the pulled pork.",

I also enjoyed the unlimited mimosas   I wish they would have a few lighter or better salad options though. I get why they don't but it would be nice",

I always get the same sandwich everytime because I find it that appetizing - it's called \"Smack Yo Mama\" which is BBQ pulled chicken, bier cheese, onions etc. it's amaaaazinggg. Super overpriced for a grilled cheese sandwich but somehow I was drawn to buying it way more often than I should have.   I also really enjoyed the Mac attack appetizer which are fried Mac and cheese balls which come with a chipotle dipping sauce. Honestly if you're not feeling too hungry, they're filling enough to be a mini meal.",

Not a huge fan of chips but hey who is. Large beer selection and seasonal sangrias. I had mascow mule...delicious. Gotta try this place. Be warned they are good so they are busy. We had a hour wait but well worth it. Can't wait to try there brunch menu tomorrow. Snozzberry pancakes and chicken 'n' waffles sliders watch out!!!",

I personally had the Snozzberry Pancakes which were very good, but very sweet and a little too buttery! Next time I go, I'd probably end up trying something off the lunch menu!

So many options for any type of meat lover and then some for seafoodies and the herbivores out there. Bar had so many craft local beers on tap and cans/bottled. All sandwiches came with some pretty tasty tomato soup which tasted a little more like marinara sauce? But that honestly a plus if anything haha. We ordered the cheesy caprese and the laferty daniel. Both were so flavorful, toast was buttery and warm, and the cheeses and sauce were rich and plentiful. Great by itself or dipped in the soup. Chips were interesting, cajun spiced or garlic herb topped. Price was decent too. Staff was quick, filled waters in mason jars for us and had our food out quick. Would definitely return.",

I'm a grilled cheese and tomato soup lover to the max so this really hit the spot for me. The sandwich was served with tomato soup and I upgraded my fries to mac and cheese. Everything was spot on and deliciously gooey and filling. You can't believe how many varieties of grilled cheese this place offers, and I'm generally a pretty  'plain Jane' type and was straying with even the fried green tomatoes and bacon, but it did not disappoint.   The others in my group were equally happy with their selections and we walked away ready to fall into a food coma for the afternoon. Amazing, would definitely return again when in Pittsburgh!!",

Get the poutin as for the grilled cheese our party loved the: smack yo mama, Mac attack, fried green tomatoes, crabby patty and mother of dragons if you love heat. Each sandwich was large came with tots or chips and a side of tomato soup. Many of us weren't able to finish the sandwiches because they were so big and had plenty of cheese.  We arrived with a party of 8 and the wait was 90 minutes. After about a 30 minute wait we were seated. Definitely get reservations here if you plan to come here for brunch.   Highly recommend this place if your looking for great comfort food and great drink specials. They had a $18 Bloody Mary special which includes 8 refills. Located right in market square there's plenty of other places to check out to shop and eat.",

Mine was Firehouse Red and my husband had some IPA.  We both made good choices.   Server was quick and helpful.  I LOVE buffalo chicken, so the Buffy the Mac Attack Slayer was a no brainer for me.   My husband ordered the Full Monte Cristo.   Food came quickly and was served with their tomato soup and chips.   Everything was hot and seemed freshly made.    The soup is nothing special,  or even really like tomato soup.   I used it as a dip for my chips.   I was super disappointed in my sandwich.  I love mac and cheese, but that's all you all you could taste.   The buffalo chicken had no zip to it and just tasted like cooked chicken.   Really a big bummer as this combo was a dream come True for me.   My husband really liked his sandwich.   His was huge and although different, as it wasn't fried in egg batter, he loved the flavors.  Prices were typical of a restaurant of this type.   Variety of beer is nice, daily specials look priced well.",

The first drinks were great while we were waiting for a table. The 2nd drinks and 3rd were much less alcohol. At point my date got a glass of just Orange juice. The bloody Mary bar was missing pepper, hot sauce, and salt. Still very good bloody Mary.  After 15 minutes we finally got to order the grilled cheese sandwiches. They were great coming out pretty quick and hot. Surprised how greasy they were but I didn't mind as much as my date.

As a vegetarian, I was excited about a place that served grilled cheese; however, for a grilled cheese, there really wasn't much cheese happening. I ordered the Shrooms sandwich. The bread was dry toasted, or at least it tasted dry toasted. If I'm eating a grilled cheese, please don't skimp on the butter when toasting the bread. I obviously am not watching my my fat intake for this meal.   The fried macaroni balls were good, not spectacular, but good enough to be the best part of meal. (When is Melt going to come to Pittsburgh?? We've graced Cleveland with a Fatheads, it's only fair that they return the favor.) For a grilled cheese, it really wasn't melty, creamy, fatty and delicious like you would expect a $10.00 grilled cheese to be. Honestly, I've  made better grilled cheese at home that involved American cheese.   Overall, I probably wouldn't go back because there are just so many more delicious options downtown that aren't trying to rupture my eardrums with their far too loud music.",

However, once we were seated, the server was very friendly and accommodating despite the complicated nature of our visit to the yard. I am limited on what I can order, so I simply had tomato soup. It was the best tomato soup I've ever had, and certainly worth $5. Though, I should have ordered just a cup instead of a full bowl.  My friends ordered grilled cheese sandwiches and a veggie burger. Everything looked great, but the grilled cheeses were not grilled. It was dry toast with lightly melted cheese. We were all disappointed.   The veggie burger, while massive, was quite boring compared to other veggie burgers in the city, so I wouldn't come here for that.  Overall, I feel like my entire experience was just ok. It's not bad, but I wouldn't spring to come here over say, Burgatory. Even some other restaurants around the downtown location are better options.   Maybe next time, The Yard. And probably not your downtown location.",

I have only been to brunch once, but it was a travesty. Not good. I got eggs and breakfast potatoes and they were thee most bland thing I have ever eaten. They have all of these fancy breakfast dishes when they can't even get basic breakfast right?   But, their cheesecake is out of this world. I hate plain cheesecake, but The Yard's is excellent.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed this place. The only downside to my visit was the fact that it was INCREDIBLY LOUD, but it was happy hour and of course that means they are doing good business! They have a great menu with a lot of different flavors, so there really is something for everyone. While they market everything as grilled cheese sandwiches, they really are just sandwiches that happen to have cheese and a whole lot of other things on them. Not a bad thing, but if you're looking for a legitimate grilled cheese, you'll have to special order it because they don't have one on the menu!  I had the Mac Attack which is deep fried Mac & Cheese served with a creamy srirachi dipping sauce. So delicious! You really can't go wrong with friend Mac & Cheese. For my sandwich, I chose the \"Pierogies N' At\" because I live in Pittsburgh and pierogis are a regular part of my balanced diet. I requested no kielbasa, so it had gouda, cheddar pierogis and fried onions and French fries. I love the fact that they serve it with a little tomato soup for dipping! The bread was thick and crusty and the filling was great.   The service was prompt despite the crowd and I would definitely check this place out again--- maybe not during a happy hour since I usually prefer more of a chill atmosphere, but the food would bring me back for sure.",

I've heard mixed reviews about The Yard in Market Square, but still, any place that specializes in grilled cheese... I'm there.  Our service was quick and accurate, both very important things when you're hungry but in a rush. Our server was totally on board with the fact that we had to fly out of there, and he had our food out in less than 10 minutes, and our checks on the table shortly after so we wouldn't have to wait for anything.   Truthfully, I can't remember what my sandwich was called, but it was REALLY good. Perfect portion, everything tasted great and was exactly what I expected based on the menu description.   I can't wait to go back when I have more time!",

    "text": "The reviews are in, and I would agree with a 4 star rating. Not because the food is poor, or the service is bad, but mainly because of the price of what you are getting. I mean... Come on, its grilled cheese. Anywho! The only other downside other than the prices was that the place isnt that large, we waited a good 40 minutes for a table of 6 (it sort of appears that its not built for larger groups, so if you're less than a party of 5 you should be in for a shorter wait). We started with the Mac Attack's Balls and these were DEFINITELY worth the price. There were 6 of them and they were delicious. Who doesnt like deep fried mac and cheese balls? Of course, theres some ranch to dip them in too! After reading a few reviews I ended up getting a sandwich with Mac and Cheese. It did NOT disappoint. I ended up getting the \"Buffy the Mac Attack Slayer\", again, was not disappointed but the price seemed a little high. The menu is extensive, and it is not all inclusive to cheesy items. They do have salads, and burgers, and other sandwiches. The Yard is clearly geared towards the 21+ club. The draft list is long, and very well thought out, theres a beer out there for everyone! Sundays (the day were there) would be a great spot for a pre-steelers game spot. (Almost) Bottomless Mimosas for $15 dollars. You can get up to 15 Mimosas before you need to repurchase. If you can do that, kudos to you, I am impressed. They also have a bloody mary bar, I forget the prices on those, but they seemed fairly priced. There is a \"well\" price and a \"top-shelf\" price. Overall I would recommend this place to someone out of town that likes the low key bar atmosphere, and wants some good food. I will most likely be back!",

Over the course of several different visits I've had several different grilled cheeses, fry flavors, a burger, and a flatbread.  Everything I've eaten has been tasty with a special emphasis on the fries and the tomato soup.  The sweet potato fries and cajun fries are great, and even though I usually don't like tomato soup I really enjoy it as a side with the grilled cheeses.  My only complaint is that loud bar music bleeds over into the rest of the restaurant, making it hard to have a conversation.",

My friend had a crab sandwich with onion rings that was off the hook. The set up of the restaurant was not what I'm use to, but that's okay. The customer service was okay.

    "text": "This was my first time in Pittsburgh and we only had a short layover. We weren't sure where to stop and one of my crew members had come across The Yard online. I am sooo glad she did! This place is great! *granted we visited during a pirates game, so it was probably not as full as it normally is due to everyone being next door at the game... but as soon as the game was over, it DEFINITELY filled up fast*   We were so impressed with the beer selection and found some great beers to enjoy with our dinner. One of which was the Cloud Walker, that was recommended by our server Brittany. She was spot on with all the recommendations and we really appreciated it! Thanks to her I tried the My Diet Starts Monday grilled cheese. It was excellent!!! And soo much food! I ended up taking half home to enjoy the next day.    All the grilled cheese sandwiches  come with tomato soup . I didn't realize this till it came out and it was such a great surprise and the source of some definite nostalgia. The soup was great, and the sandwich was so full of flavor. The option for a side were some homemade chips or you could upgrade to fries or sweet potato fries. Brittany recommended the sweet potato fries, and so I decided to go for it. Many places make great fries but the dip for the sweet potato fries can sometimes be too sweet and not appealing. That was not the case here. The fries came with a cinnamon sugar whip on the side, which was soo good! It wasn't overly sweet and had such a great flavor that you wanted to make sure you had some on every bite of your fries.   I'm really impressed, by the food and service we experienced here and would certainly come back if I'm in the area again!   Only thing to note if you are planning to visit,  is that it is on the second floor and the only way up is the stairs which may not make it accessible to everyone.  Just something to keep in mind.",

The restaurant is upstairs with windows on one wall facing the square. Other parts of the dining room cant really see that view, but at least there are ample TVs around to watch \"the game.\"   My buddy and I got a couple rounds of beers and while our waitress was not incredibly familiar with the brews, she let us try a few before making a selection. We also got an order of wings which were just fine, but nothing to write home about. Solid American bar food, nothing wrong, just nothing special.",

I love a good grilled cheese, and find some of their wacky combos to work very well.  And the small side of tomato soup works great with a grilled cheese, as expected.  Service is decent, but somewhere behind the scenes, something may be amiss:  two of the three people in my group got the wrong food.  They made it right, and the manager visited; very nice.  So overall, it's worth a visit, and some of the food is very good, and the price is reasonable.  So Yelp's 3-star definition of \"A-OK\" fits well here.  It's good, not amazing.",

Has a welcoming, yet upbeat atmosphere with food to drool over, and a large selection of beer on tap for just about anyone. The mac'attack balls to start were amazing. I had a simple buffalo flatbread with a couple timely drinks, as my partner went with the fresh Prince grilled cheese. Everything was great for a nice early dinner. The only hunch to it was the unhinged bipolar service. Drinks and food were timely, but the interaction from guest to waiter was off at the end. Especially when I try to say goodbye, and get no goodbye from my waiter, but from the host, who was next to my waiter as she sat on her phone. Waiting to grab the 50% gratuity I left... always remember to say goodbye and many thanks to good customers!!",

    "text": "We worked up a real hunger shopping in the fabulous Clark Building Jewelry shops for sparkly diamonds.  It was fairly early (around 2PM) so we didn't want a heavy meal.  The Yard seemed to fit the bit so we headed on up to the second floor above Yovi's Hotdog place.  It was surprisingly crowded with lots of families.  That is great to see in downtown Pittsburgh on a bleary cold February afternoon.  In the not so distant past, downtown was a ghost town on weekends except for sports and Cultural District patrons.  Hurrah for the turnaround!  We have tried the Yard a few times for their awesome selection of draft beers and decent happy hour music selection but it had been a while since we actually ate there.  The menu is mostly bar food highlighted by a page full of variations on the grilled cheese theme.  I like their grilled cheeses but then, I'm a real Texas Toast lover so that's not a surprise.  I tried out the Yard Walker sandwich with chicken, bacon, cheddar, and garlic aioli with lettuce and tomato and red onion on a brioche bun. It was just okay, not great but not horrible either.  I think it needed seasoning like salt and pepper or something because it was a little bland, to be honest.    For a side, I substituted fresh cut thin sliced French fries with parmesan cheese sprinkled on them and herbs.  They were supposed to be garlic parm but I detected very little garlic.  They were fresh and slightly crispy and the right portion.  My gf ordered the poutine fries that come with gravy, cheese curds, short ribs, and beer cheese.  They came in a metal bowl and were essentially a HUGE LIMP GLOB of melted cheese and fries. They were sort of bland too.  Disappointing and not even good the next day.   Our server was excellent!  The price was $35 for two of us without any beer (just tea and water).  I think it's a great spot to hang out after work or before a ballgame but not really my first choice for food.",

    "text": "We've been here once before, but for breakfast.  Back then, it was more about the brunch offerings than the grilled cheese sammies.  We enjoyed brunch, so we decided to give it another try for dinner.  Tonight I had the Fried Green Tomatoes Grilled Cheese and the hubby had the Los Pollos Hermanos Grilled Cheese.  Both sandwiches came with tomato soup and while the hubby stuck with the homemade chips, I opted for the fresh cut fries.  The FGT sammie was tasty, but I found myself missing the taste of cheese.  Mostly had the taste of the tomatoes and bacon.  So, for a Grilled Cheese, it didn't hold up for me.    The LPH sammie was really good.  The chicken was juicy and the combo of the bacon and honey mustard was a win.  However, again, no real cheese flavor to speak of.  Additionally, both sammies were very greasy.  My guess is they get that awesome crunch on the bread using lots of butter.  And who can argue with lots of butter??  So I'm not gonna complain about that.  The fries were really good.  They were fried to perfection and great little dunkers for the obviously homemade tomato soup, which was also very tasty.  Pros: The food is very tasty The price is reasonable ($35 before tip for 2 meals and a beer) The service is top notch  Cons: During happy hour and on the weekends it can be a bit noisy The Grilled Cheese sammies don't have much cheese - They should be marketed as unique sandwiches Parking can be difficult - I know, why bother mentioning anymore.  It's in Market Square Downtown, which everyone knows is not known for parking ease.  All in all, it's a solid sandwich joint in Market Square.  We'll most likely be back again.",

Bottomless mimosas for $15 was what I came for. I got an omelet and honestly it was meh. It was over cooked and kind of hard. The texture just wasn't right for an omelet.

We sat at the bar and Jason (our bartender) was very attentive and answered any questions we had regarding the menu or any of the beers on tap, and there are plenty! The only negative I would say is the portion sizes. I had the poutine which was fantastic, but was somewhat saddened by the relatively small bowl and portion that it came with. My coworker got the Jerk grilled cheese and was happy with it, but to me, it looked like it was lacking some additional meat. All in all, this place is good, with fantastic service and good atmosphere that wasn't too loud to have a one on one conversation with a coworker!",

It looked cute, but I didn't partake in the fun. I did stare at people (totally not in a creepy way) as they made their combinations.   The grilled cheese menu look amazing! It reminded me of Melt in Cleveland, OH with all the calories and glory that cheese brings!  Since we were there for brunch, I chose to get an Eggs Benedict. It was pretty tasty, but the hollandaise sauce seemed to disappear as it sat on my eggs, like it was there but as it became room temperature it didn't hold up to the creamy texture it should have. I don't know what that means, maybe not enough egg yolk? Maybe not enough sauce? Everyone's else food was good too I mean nothing to talk too much about I guess. I'd come here again for brunch, but I might try something else... and get a Bloody Mary lol  Our waitress was very friendly and the hostess greeted us pleasantly!   The bathroom, could use some improvements, especially for how nice the rest of the restaurant is. You have to walk past the kitchen to get to the bathroom, which is kind of fun because you can see if it's clean or not lol *It's clean!",

Our waitress Hunter was so bubbly and sweet, and they had our food out to us in literally 10 minutes!  I had the Smack Yo Mama grilled cheese, the pulled chicken on it had so much flavor! And the sweet potato waffle fries with cinnamon butter were nice and light and a nice contrast to my savory sandwich. We will definitely be back!",

The sandwich needed more toppings on it. If I'm spending over 10 dollars on a grilled cheese, I expect it to be loaded with cheese, meat, veggies, ect. The chips were a bit burned and seemed reheated. I've been to a gourmet grill cheese restaurant before and this place was sub par compared to the previous place I'd visited in Cleveland. I've been to the downtown location, not sure if Shadyside is better. The soup that was with my sandwich was good. The menu is large, great ideas, great atmosphere.",

    "text": "Overall, a great place and would come again.  I got the Dr. Dobak - Provolone / Cheddar / Short Rib / Strawberry Onion Jam / Onion Rings  I like to cut my burgers/sandwiches in half before eating them. And that cut showed just how much juice the short ribs had! The meat was tender, and everything was easy to cut. The only downside was that the short ribs had so much juice that the bottom loaf became soggy, so I ate it upside down. You'll need to get your hands a little dirty for this, but definitely worth it. Originally, I was a little worried about that \"Strawberry onion jam\" but I didn't taste any strawberry flavor at all.  I got their garlic parm chips. Nothing really spectacular but still decent.  The tomato soup that goes with the set is some really good tomato soup. Very thick but refreshing. It's the type that if you scoop the soup all towards one side, it was somewhat slowly slide back to even. Highly recommend this if you're starving, want a good meal, and then enter food coma for the next 2 hours while sitting in your couch watching Netflix. Would also recommend getting gelato or ice cream afterwards.",

They have multiple food options such as an assortment of grilled cheese, burgers, flatbread sandwiches and salads. For the sides you can choose from an option of different fries, tomato soup, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, a veggie of the day or fruit.   At this location I've had the crabby patty grilled cheese and the turkey burger, both times with the sweet potato fries as my side. The sweet potato fries come with a side of cinnamon butter to dip them in it and it so delicious. I would highly recommend this place for lunch, a dinner get together, or a date.   I wouldn't suggest coming here if there is a big event going on downtown because it gets really crowded and really loud. A friend and I came to this location after work on St. Patricks day and there were so many people in there we couldn't hear each other when we got seated. It also took our waiter a long time to even great us and take our drink order.",

Their chili is really, really good when it's available, as is their tomato soup which is, I believe, always available. Service has always been friendly and prompt. I would suggest a reservation if you suspect a busy evening though. The first time my wife and I tried to go it was quite crowded and a table wasn't available for at least three hours. But we've also been there when it was pretty quiet and our reservation wasn't necessary, so it's really dependent upon the situation, season, and events going on in the city that night I think.  Overall, however, I will continue to go there with regularity; one of my favorite joints in the city and for the style and price range I don't think you'll find much better.",

They have so many different grilled cheeses to choose from. I got the one with buffalo chicken dip that came with chips and tomato soup. It was called \"frank the tank\", which made me laugh. The sandwich was delicious! The homemade chips were really good too. The tomato soup was just okay. I could take it or leave it. They had a Bloody Mary bar that I didn't get, but someone else in my party did and enjoyed. My favorite thing about the yard was their $3 full pint white lightenings on Sunday! It's my favorite beer and not many places in the area have it. We also had really good service. I will be returning to the yard and am looking forward to trying another gourmet grilled cheese!",

So why did I give it 3 stars? This place is trying to cater to a certain clientele. Those that work downtown and or live downtown. Prime real estate in downtown Pittsburgh isn't cheap. Knowing that, places like these will always pack their buildings because people want affordable dining right around the corner from where they live. I can't wait until hubby brings the kid here to dine. She would just love it.",

    "text": "Dear grilled cheese...I want to love you, I really do...but I just don't.  The thing about the grilled cheese list is that it LOOKS fantastic.  I love grilled cheese and always get excited about the options at The Yard.   The problem is that they simply fail to deliver.   I don't know what it is, but I've had 5 different varieties now and none of them have lived up to the hype on the menu.     There are a few things I like about the Yard though, so it gets a middle of the road review from me.   What I like:  - Happy Hour.   Anytime I can get a $4 glass of wine downtown, I am down.     - The beer list.  I don't drink beer, but my beer-snob friends love the selection at The Yard.     - The sides.   I did actually enjoy some of the sides (the mac and cheese, sweet potato fries, and Caesar salad).     Pro tip:  If you are going to try a grilled cheese, it's well worth it to swap out BOTH the chips (overcooked most of the time) and tomato soup (just so-so in my book).   You can do the upcharge to select alternatives to both, which wasn't super clear on the menu, but has worked every time I have gone.   The Caesar Salad is huge, so if you are going that route with a substitution, I'd recommend splitting or taking leftovers.      A couple of other things to know:  - You have to go up a flight of stairs to get in there, so it isn't for the very elderly, injured, etc.   -  It is crazy loud in there.  If you are looking for conversation, the bar is probably easier than the tables.  At the tables, you have to shout when it's crowded.     - The bathroom is in the back - past the food window and a bunch of kegs and up a ramp.  It appears to be an afterthought inside and out.",

    "text": "My daughters & I went to the Galleria location for Sunday brunch. I had looked at the menu in advance & was excited by the numerous and interesting-sounding grilled cheese sandwich selections. We were there about noon and it was not crowded at all. Our server AJ was very attentive. I was having trouble understanding the beer flight concept and he went to a lot of trouble to be sure I understood how it worked. My one daughter had a coffee with Baileys and the other daughter had the (almost) bottomless mimosas. We placed our order and the food was received quickly. My one daughter had the pollo hermano grilled cheese with waffle sweet potato fries (the sandwiches come with chips but one can order other sides for an additional charge). The fries came with a cinnamon butter- a nice touch. My other daughter ordered from the brunch menu the breakfast club - 2 pancakes sandwiching all kinds of good fillings. Very good. It came with home fries which were dried out- rosemary dusted near- croutons. I ordered the fried green tomato grilled cheese - Cheddar and American cheese, fried green tomatoes, applewood bacon & chipotle mayo. I also ordered same home fries. Now for a place that seems as if it specializes in grilled cheese sandwiches at about the $10-&15 range, I expected an ooey-gooey dripping-in-cheese grilled cheese. All come on a Texas toast which is fine but other breads grill up exceptionally well also. I had to open the sandwich up to see if there was cheese in it. I could see a slice of American cheese. The bacon was ok, and the fried green tomatoes were golden brown but a bit bland. I was so disappointed! They could take a lesson from Rachael Ray on how to prepare a proper grilled cheese! Let me not forget the nice cup of tomato soup that comes with the sandwiches. It tastes homemade and fresh. It is served in a metal (I don't know what kind of metal) cup and the soup seems to pick up the taste of the metal a little. All in all we had an enjoyable time but I wasn't wowed.",

The bartender was friendly and prompt with welcoming me; he also helped my choice in picking out my meal.  I tried the BBQ chicken grilled cheese and the sweet potato fries, with the side of tomato soup. Tomato soup tastes just like tomato soup, but could've been warmer when served. The sweet potato fries would've been better without the extra salt/seasoning served on them - the cinnamon butter complimented them enough. The BBQ chicken grilled cheese sandwich was yummy and had a good mix of flavor. I thought the $11 price might've been a bit steep but at least there was a good amount of chicken.  However the low star rating is due to the lack of communication. I saw a poster about trivia. The start time was wrong (not a big deal); but then when I show up with my team, we are told there is no room because all tables were reserved. No heads up on needing reservations.  So while I might check it out in the future, I won't go out of my way or recommend it to anyone.",

The \"bottomless\" booze brunch is a bit expensive, and I'd probably save my money and atleast go having already eaten and munch on olives and celery and bacon (yeah.. they get an extra star for having bacon on the bloody mary bar).

They use texas toast for all of the grill cheeses, even though they stock other breads for burgers and sandwiches. I'm not a huge fan of texas toast and would've much rathered a heartier, actual bread (multi-grain maybe?) than something so white and processed that it's hardly worth eating. If they already have the different breads in the kitchen, why not use it for grill cheeses?  2. The \"tomato soup\" that comes with the grill cheese I swear is just marinara sauce. It isn't bad, but come on, if you're going to serve a sauce then say so. When the menu says \"tomato soup\" I actually expect something like soup, not thick like red sauce.",

We had to ask for refills and ask twice for condiments after our food was brought out. That wasn't the let down though, the worst part was the food. I had the \"slap yo mama\" - the pulled chicken was bland and dried out, the Texas toast wasn't nothing special. The overall sandwich just didn't have a good taste. We also had the appetizer nachos and the pulled chicken on that was also bland, tasteless, and dry. The nachos had no flavor - just bland plain chicken, chips, lettuce, cheese, and sour cream. It needed something on it for flavor. The other person with me had a burger, and it was just a boring, could get a similar burger anywhere, burger. Overall super sad experience, we are not from around here and were looking for a fun Pittsburgh experience.",

First of all the menu is all fried, double cheese or french fries, gravy, tator tots with everything.  I ordered the poutine as I was going the unhealthy route and also craved comfort food as it was 23 degrees F out and snowing. They did not use real cheese curds, they used regular cheese. I guess I could not get my taste of Montreal there. The unlimited mimosa's for $15 tasted like Sunny D and very little flat champagne or probably $5 bottle of sparkling wine. Even after 3 of them on an empty tummy I felt no buzz. I do not see what this place is all about.",

We ordered the nachos with chicken.  The shredded chicken looked  suspicious.  The melted cheese was from a can, and there was very little salsa. I asked for more and our waitress came back with a 2oz cup full?  My husband ordered the grilled cheese. Our waitress forgot to put his order in. The main reason for the 2 stars is I went to the restroom which was located by the kitchen. The kitchen looked very dirty and there was a mop bucket next to the bread that was lined up against the floor.  If I had seen the kitchen prior to eating I would have left.",

Positives are they have a kids menu with crayons and stuff and are kid friendly.  Pittsburgh Salad was good and had a fried egg on top.  The WacArnold was good (their play on a Big Mac- Patty melt style), but a tip would be to skip the lettuce on it. It's that mixed green lettuce and it comes to you all wilted and makes the sandwich taste like dirt.  They have vegetarian options also for the veg lovers.  It's decent and I'd say to try it for something a little different. Lots of beers on tap too.",

Besides that, I liked that the menu offers a variety of meat and vegetarian options, they serve alcoholic drinks for those who want them, and the service is reportedly fast. I was worried about the noise level, which was justified, but everything else was fine: they quickly brought our four different grilled cheeses that we described as spicy, \"like a burger,\" sweet, and complicated; generous side salads; and bills that were $30 per couple. We even liked the tomato soup. As a plus, they had the Colts-Steelers game on, too. -1 star for having to shout through dinner.",

    "text": "I have been to the Yard both for dinner and for brunch, as well as just for drinks.  I should preface this review by saying that I don't really eat a lot of dairy (so why the hell did I go to a grilled cheese place?!)   Their sandwiches are pretty good.  You can get a grilled cheese with pretty much anything on it, they are hearty, and warm, and pretty delicious.  My friend is OBSESSED with the fried green tomatoes, though i can't personally attest.  You get fries on the side and can get regular, or sweet potato, or Cajun, or old bay (still not 100% sure how this is different from Cajun), I might be missing something--I was a tad disappointed in the sweet potato, but the Cajun were on point. And what is a grilled cheese without tomato soup? Honestly, I really do not like their tomato soup, something about it just doesn't taste right.    And who doesn't love brunch?  You can get mimosas or do the Bloody Mary bar. It may be wise to make a reservation (especially for more than 4 people) for a brunch, but I have squeezed in with a party if 5. The only time I ordered something than a grilled cheese, I got the chorizo scramble from the brunch menu--it was fine, but though it says \"spicy chorizo\" on the menu, nothing about it is spicy.    Thus, for food I would probably go with a 3, but the bar is great! They always have a great draft list and I have had a lot of fun talking to some of the bartenders. That being said, the wait staff (though I think some of my favorites are now gone) is also incredible (except the sassy guy I had at brunch last time).",

The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the hosts (to whom I, again, voluntarily gave my full beer) were apologetic and actually tried to give me my beer back on my way out because it was \"90% full, ma'am.\" I did come in at 1am but in essence: nothing is worth the potential attitude of the bartender. I'll buy my drinks elsewhere. You lost a good tipper tonight, kids. Your loss.  PS (as the daughter of a small business owner)-- your bartender is the face of your place.

I'm the worst type of person and changed my mind about the bottomless bloody mary's I had ordered so my waiter kindly let me switch to mimosas without hesitation. It took forever to figure out what to order because they have so many options. I finally decided on a breakfast burrito and it was delicious. It was huge for the price and they give a side of potatoes. Everyone else either had something from the brunch menu or the grilled cheese options. I regretted my decision after I tasted my friend's buffalo mac n cheese grilled cheese. That sandwich is marriage material.   The restaurant was a little loud and it was hard to hear everyone at the table at times, but that's expected of a popular brunch spot on Sundays. The friendly/fast service, amazing food, and mimosas made up for it. I think we found a new tradition for Sundays.",

It didn't appear to have a long wait, so we decided to eat there and I'm delighted we did!   The service was fantastic. My co-worker is a vegetarian and couldn't decide between the garden burger and grilled cheese, so he asked the waiter. The waiter was also a vegetarian and was honest with him. He steered him away from the garden burger due to its lack of flavor, so my co-worker decided on the Cheesy Capresey and really enjoyed it.   I also ordered grilled cheese, The Big-Chewboaki. It was amazing. I love the combination of egg with the Texas toast style bread. It came with a small, perfectly portioned for dipping, tomato soup and homemade chips. I got old bay flavored. The chips were crispy and flavorful and were a perfect complement.   The atmosphere inside was also nice. They have a pretty big bar and there were a good bit of patrons having a few drinks before the Pirate game.   Overall, my first experience at The Yard in market square was great!",

    "text": "I heard a lot of good reviews regarding the yard. I figured I would have to try it out. Who doesn't like grilled cheese little lamb gourmet grilled cheese? We visited the Market Square location. It was very busy and I am glad I made reservations ahead of time. Highly recommend making reservations if you plan on going on the weekend.  There were so many gourmet grilled cheeses to choose from I wasn't sure what what I was going to pick. I ended up getting Slap your Mama. I must say this was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. The chicken was tender and moist with just the right amount of sauce. I also ordered the chips along the side. The chips were a little overdone but still very tasty. The soup was not my favorite but it was okay.  This location is tucked away but definitely a must go to! Will be back.",

I have been there for lunch and dinner as well. If I had to recommend a specific sandwich, it would have to be the bison burger. I would also recommend Erin the bartender if you are stopping in for a drink after a long day at the office; she is knowledgeable, experienced, and very friendly. Five star stop without a doubt!",

    "text": "I LOVE grilled cheese sandwiches, in fact, during my entire pregnancy I craved grilled cheese sandwiches and I made my husband go here often!  Our most recent visit was to market square over the weekend, and it didn't disappoint.  One of my favorites is the big che-bowski, which is what I got.  It is served on texas toast with gouda cheese, bacon, fried egg and tomato.  The fried egg really makes the grilled cheese,as soon as you bite into it, or cut it in half as I do, the yolk  breaks and makes for a great dip and just adds another dimension to the sandwich.  I've also had the poppin my collar, and that is equally as good.  I actually turned my husband onto poppin my collar, which is what he got.  If you like a little spice, this is perfect.  I know, shrimp on a grilled cheese sounds odd, but I assure you, this will not disappoint!  After looking at the appetizers, we finally decided on the yard poutine, the pub pretzels and mac attack were our other choices, which are both very good.  It was delicious, a bit messy, so eat with a fork.  They give you a nice portion and it's big enough to share with 2-4 people.  The servers are all very nice and friendly, they don't hover over you like some places, but they make sure that you are taken care of.  I would highly recommend The Yard Market Square if you're in the mood for a good grilled cheese and a good beer!",
