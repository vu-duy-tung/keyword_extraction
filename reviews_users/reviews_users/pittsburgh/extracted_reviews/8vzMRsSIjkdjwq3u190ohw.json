    "text": "Sree's offers an exceptional value. For $5 you get enough food to fill up even a 6'5\" guy like me! It is all prepared with quality and freshness of ingredients in mind. Some Indian food is prepared way too spicy. Sree's food is absolutely authentic Hyderabad style, and you can enjoy it without being overwhelmed by hotness! I first went to the Sree's in Squirrel Hill in 1996, now I frequent the downtown location. Another thing that is nice about this place is that it's a family affair. When I went in today Sree's very congenial wife Vydehi was serving the food, her mother was on the cash register and their delightful daughter Sreethanaya was sitting at a little table eating lunch. I highly recommend Sree's - 4 STARS! BTW please pray for Sree. He's been diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) so he can use all of our prayers. For more information on Sree's visit their website: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.srees.com%2F&s=9f4e5781b1a743fe18d54c349d60345b680e0b67cf83d1329f7687f27756e369\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">srees.com</a>",

Ray and I stopped in a day or two prior to the G20 summit when downtown was virtually a ghost town (kinda like a weekend day in Pgh, but this was a Wednesday).  It's a small place in a V shaped building with two entrances.  Ray and I walk in for the first time and no one really is in the spot (again G20).  The tables are on both sides of the building facing the wall with paper towels and plastic silverware, hot sauce scattered around.  There is an extremely pleasant indian lady behind the heated trays who greets us warmly with a broad smile and a pleasant demeanor (this is one of the reasons I wanted to rate this place better).  The meals are very cheap at $5 for the chicken curry, rice and another vegetable (think some type of chick pea).  I also appreciate their selection of drinks which includes coconut water.  I kinda had an idea what I was gonna be in for when I looked at the sad bread.  I was expecting roti or naan, but this was cold semi stale pita.  We have a seat and being somewhat of a curry maven I look forward to a flavorful lunch, but sadly the meat is somewhat dry and the curry lacks any real flavor or spice.  The rice is fine and I've already commented on the pita.  The chick pea side had a little more flavor, but still nothing close to good.  The lady was so endearing that I almost gave the place three stars, however the food really was sub par.  I can only imagine they are specifically tailoring this food to the masses who want cheap food and are only dabbling in indian flavors with the tamed down flavor level.  I probably won't go back.",

I would usually eat 1/2 for lunch and take 1/2 home for dinner, which...eating largely on $3 a day anywhere is almost impossible.  I don't think he had any meat options at CMU, at least not back then.  Looks like the prices have gone up to $5 since then- still an amazing deal.",

While the chicken is delicious and a pretty huge portion, it's a bit greasy so I usually opt for 3 vegetable curries. Of the vegetables, they always have a chickpea potato one plus three other rotating varieties, including -- off the top of my head -- tomato dal, grapeleaves, mixed veg tofu, cauliflower tomato, spinach potato, eggplant. I'm a fan of the tomato dal.  A lot of the curries have a rather sour acidic flavor, but pretty tasty.  The pita is completely pointless and you're better off forgoing it (for extra rice if you want). If they had nan I might give it another star.  The downtown location is only open for lunch, with very limited seating -- it's mainly set up for quick take-out.",

It brought back (bad) memories of my mom's pop-open-a-can-dash-of-salt culinary style, or as my partner mentioned -- cafeteria food complete with the no-nonsense service. The green beans were nostalgically plain and the carrots were very oily. The spices were not very distinct in any of the dishes. And the pita on the side was an unwelcome touch.   The cost matters much less to me than flavor. I could buy a more satisfying array of canned goods at the grocery store for $5, while I would happily pay $10 for a quality authentic Indian style lunch.   I am sure that Sree's is highly convenient for those who work (or live in a box) downtown, and for those poor souls, I recommend that you at least bring your own container to save the styrofoam.",

Fresh ingredients, vegan friendly vegetarian fair, great chicken curry, and all for about 5 bucks.  Sounds perfect doesn't it.

The food is pretty good -- the dishes remind me of when I would go to my friend's mom's and be invited to stay for an impromptu dinner.  Sree's does vegetables better than they do meat, go vegan; the chicken breast is dry and stringy, even though it's sauced.  Had the grape leaves curry (tangy), chickpeas and potatoes (creamy gold potatoes), aromatic cauliflower.  Lots of warming heat and mix of spices in the curries; sauce nicely sopped by a piece of naan (although the naan seemed commercial).  Some of the vegetables obviously from a frozen, pre-prepped product (carrots,broccoli) or canned (chickpeas), but who doesn't have those staples in their pantry; you can't beat the price ($6 for 3 sides and rice), and it's thoroughly satisfying.",

Obviously you can go pay more fot indian food downtown if you want nan and basmati rice, but its not gonna be vegan since all the dishes are cooked with ghee, and no one is going to be as awesome as mrs. sree.  This is my favorite place to eat in pittsburgh not beacause its the fanciest or most painstaikingly crafted food, but because of the value, heartiness and comfort it brings me. My tip would be to go on monday, wednesday or friday. I mostly eat there on those days, (even though the grape leaf curry.has grown on me) beacause that is when I can get the tofu, chickpeas, and either tomato dal or blackeye pea.with spinach.  Other days you may not find the same level of delish.... Also, last time I went they switched back to the triangle shaped tofu! I love it!",

    "text": "I have eaten at Sree's about once a week for the last several years. It is certainly not top end Indian food and there are very few choices. The menu rotates everyday, but most of the options remain the same. Taramind chicken, vegetable tofu, tomato dal, eggplant curry, potato chickpea and tomato cauliflower.   Although the food isn't particularly amazing, it is an extremely good value. For six dollars you get chicken, rice, bread and a vegetarian choice or three veggie choices with rice and bread. Once in a while there are special menu offerings such as samosas and an alternative type of chicken, but not very often.   To the people complaining, my question is what non-chain or fast food option is available as a healthy lunch in downtown Pittsburgh for six dollars?",

Time = Sree's usually has a small line inside, but the one or two staff members always push everyone through efficiently with great service and a very open and caring persona.  Even in the height of the lunch rush, you never have any hidden surprises when you're in need of a quick grab and go.  $ = Under $6 for an entire box of quality food...  check.  I can't think of many places that offer you more, good quality food at this price point.  Value = Sree's has some solid flavors.  While not the best Indian I've ever had, it definitely delivers in the well-sought after spice department.  I typically order the chicken, and take the staff's suggestion for the vegetable of the day (usually three or four options).  They also offer a hearty vegetarian plate and samosas that deliver on expectations.  A few notes...  if you like to sweat (like I do), Sree's has a slow-burn hot sauce that pairs well with everything you can order.  Also, seating, while scarce, does the job if you aren't looking to have a conversation (tables are placed up against the walls).",

Its your Indian equivalent of moms home cooking, and that's what we (the positive reviewers of this place) like. If you don't like it fine, but don't bad mouth the place.

Once you get past the dismal decor of the \"restaurant\" itself and figure maybe the food will at least be ok, you get a dish slapped into a takout plate by a pleasant woman. It all goes downhill from there.  I ordered the vegan lunch which consisted of Eggplant , Tofu and Vegetables and Tomato and Lentils over rice.  All three were substandard.  The eggplant was ok, but did not appear to be fresh..was visually unappealing and basically not good.    The lentils and tomato served over mushy brown rice (not basmati), was light on both tomatoes and lentils but was passable as food.  But by far the worst was the tofu.  Large cubes swimming in a disgusting broth were like sponges of awfulness.  Biting into one resulted in a gushing of water that looked like it came out of the Ganges river, (thereby establishing it's only tangential connection to authentic Indian food.). Thank Annapurna (the Hindu God of food and cooking),  for the half a slice of whole wheat pita that was laying on top of the rest of this slop.  My understanding from what others tell me is there are better things to order on other days of the week. But I don't plan to return ...maybe when it eventually becomes a Subway or Starbucks.     Hoping I don't get sick.  Jim",

The place is reminiscent of an elementary school cafeteria: A small sign with today's options, a hot food line, with up to two people behind the buffet scooping orders into styrofoam boxes, and a cash register. Along the sides, there is bench seating, all complete with plastic utensil holders, paper towel rolls, and squeeze-bottles filled with a delicious and very spicy hot sauce.  If nothing else, the place is a bargain: $5 will get you the styrofoam box full of food - be it a large portion of Tamarind Chicken, or a selection of 3 out of 4 daily vegetarian offerings. Along with that, two big scoops of white rice and 'naan'(really, half of a cold white-flour pita).  The quality is where I feel really leaves desired, though. The food sits out, the the ingredients often taste canned, or otherwise processed. While the food has more flavor than, say, a Subway sandwich, I feel that as far as Indian food goes it is rather bland, unless you put enough hot sauce on it.  Taking this place for what it is, cheap indian food, it is a stop that is nice to your appetite and your wallet. If you don't work nearby, though, it's not worth a trip.",

The menu repeats weekly; that is, every Monday has the same options, every Tuesday has a different set of options, and so on.  The menu changes up from season to season; currently, the menthi carrots (Monday) and aloo saag (spinach potato, Thursday) are my two favorites.    The food is cooked off-site, and brought into this small space for lunch daily.  Sree and his family have three other locations, including a full restaurant in Sharpsburg.  Probably the healthiest, tastiest, and best value in all of Downtown Pittsburgh.",

I am a big fan of Indian food and a big a cheap skate so Sree Foods was a perfect fit for me.  This place is no BS and the most unpretentious hole in the wall kind of dive you'll ever find. You go in with $5 and you get a styrofoam container and an elderly Indian lady gives you a big heep of amazing vegan Indian food. There's usually three vegan dishes and one chicken dish. They give you a little bit of all of the available dishes and throw it together in one container. They finally then throw in a piece of naan that is like the Indian equivalent of Wonder Bread but the great dishes make up for it.  It is a cash only spot and like I said, just $5 for this daily lunch special, and $1 extra for a pop. One thing to beware of is that they fill up your styrofoam container to the max. Sometimes the food starts to leak out, so if you don't want an unnecessary dry cleaner run, be careful.",

The food is OKish. I wouldn't say tasty because all the dishes I had (chickpeas, cauliflower and spinach) were drenched in the same sauce that had a ton of nutmeg in it. Wasn't too spicy and believe me, I don't eat spicy at all. Honestly, I didn't want the rice, just the veggies, but she already put the rice in since I walked in through the door.  What bothered me is the lack of naan. Instead I was given half of a Mexican tortilla (?) that I didn't touch. I understand the price is cheap, but I would have gladly paid 1$ for some warm naan.  The place looked drab, dirty and inviting. It could do more with some clean, light colored vinyl tablecloths or perhaps no tables at all. The table I set at was dirty from a previous guest. I'm thinking if she doesn't have anyone to wipe off the tables, perhaps it would be better to just offer takeout. My church's cafeteria, by comparison, looks way nicer and cleaner, and it's not at all different from Mrs Sree's concept of a kitchen.  My conclusion is I'll stick with the Indian Spices on 6th st. At least it's a buffet, different foods taste different, like they were supposed to, there's more variety, the tables are clean and they have real, warm naan.  I will never come back to this place.",

    "text": "I am visiting Pittsburgh and had heard about Mrs. Sree's food.  My friends did not exaggerate; the food is delicious. I had the vegetarian option, with plentiful choices and loved the chickpeas and potatoes, the spinach, and the cauliflower dishes, which, along with rice or bread--I chose the flatbread, which was also surprisingly tasty--was a whopping $7.  The hot sauce was also amazing. And Mrs. Sree is such a lovely person.  The ambiance is remarkable too:  It's a rather hard to find place though it's in plain sight, occupying the point of a triangle block and Mrs. Sree keeps her dishes, etc, behind a curtain that's maybe 12 feet wide, in front of which are the steam tables, giving the whole thing a special feel, like a pop-up only better.  Plenty of tables and on this sunny day, very bright and cheerful.",

You walk inside and it's literally tables against the window.  One lady standing at a bar/steam table you tell her what you want.. BOOM, in and out.  This is the homiest fastest food I've ever had.  Faster then McDonald's!  I'll definitely be back.  I tried the vegan plate.   It comes w/rice and 3 sides & pita. $8!!!!!!   $8!!   That you can't beat.  She even let me try some chicken no upcharge.   Awesome hospitality.  Very good food.  I feel the love.  Can't wait to try the other sides next time.",

    "text": "Sorry to say this but this is Indian food at its worst. I feel really bad about being so harsh but the food could have been anything but Indian.  Greasy, spicy , tasteless food apart from the Samosa which actually tasted nice.  Tried the vegan meal which had 3 entrees , brown rice and flat bread . Here goes the food review- The brown rice - nothing to write about  Flatbread supposed to serve as Naan bread - surely bought from a Walmart type store - not even heated up . Just bad  The chickpeas - decent  The cauliflower and peas were just floating in oil  The samosa - surprisingly likable !   Most of the reviews have been positive for this restaurant- maybe this was just a one off bad day",

    "text": "Overall Impression:  A True staple of what Indian home cooking really is.  The Food: Not only is there an all-vegan option for her lunch making it friendly to special diets, but the menu changes every day to cycle through her amazing dishes and provide new offerings to newcomers. My personal favorite is Tuesday, where she makes homemade samosas (to die for) and has one of my favorite side-dishes, grape leaves! In my most recent visit, I ordered the Large Meal (because I'm worth it) which included Hyderabadi (Spicy) Chicken, grape leaves with mixed vegetables, and Tomato Dal--all over a bed of rice with plenty of different curries to go around. Some of her curries are similar in taste and relatively spicy, but some of the vegetables are less so, like her green beans, and baby eggplant. Just make sure to ask her which ones are which. I do feel like the different curry could have more depth of flavor to separate them from each other, but that would be my only suggestion of improvement.  The Restaurant: When you walk into Ms. Sree's, don't be put off by the cafeteria-style set up or the old equipment she uses--I assure you I've eaten there at least once a week and I'm still alive! She always makes sure to greet you when you walk in, and always asks how your day is going. She gives me all the grandma feels, and it's backed up by her overall sweetness and appreciation for her customers. There is a collection of photos of her late husband on the wall, who also used to work at the restaurant (before my time), and I'm sure she still keeps the place open as an honor to him, which gives me even more feels. (I'm not crying, you're crying!). The menu itself is very well-priced. I've never paid more than $9.50 for a meal, and that's when I'm being gluttonous. The amount of food you receive for that price is well worth it, adding even more value to her home-style cuisine.   TL;DR Ms. Sree is my go-to for my Indian food cravings, which occur at least once a week. She has me addicted to the wonderful spice pallet and grandma-style food. If you're into commercial Indian cooking, which is what most people are used to, you'll see from fellow reviewers that you'll be disappointed that it's not typical by any means--but to me, that's the best part.",

Despite the disheveled, unclean, and initially frightening appearance, I said hey, I'll give it a try.   To be honest if you love spicy food, you might enjoy Sree's. In my opinion the food was too spicy and all other favors were lost in the shuffle. I moved on to the rice, unfortunately one of the sides was on top and the rice was completely drowned in curry. If that's your style, more power to you. Personally I was not a fan.",

The place is old and towels hang up to block the mess of the kitchen in the back. The food is in old equipment from the 70s and the owner wears these soft hand casts that look like they havent been washed in years. The bottles on the tables literally have crust on them like they havent been washed and the atmosphere is old and moldy.  The food is way overpowered by spices to cover up the lack of quality in the meats and vegetables. I am all for spicy food but I could not even finish my meal. I've gone to this place 3 times now and figured I had a bad batch and that I needed to try other things to figure out what these reviews were all about. Nope! Every time I left dissapppinted. Even the Naan is fake! She buys store bought cheap pita bread.   Seriously I'm surprised that she passes the health inspection. If you want good indian food, Id try going to the buffets on 6th ave. Definitely way better bang for your buck. And your not questioning what is in your food.",
