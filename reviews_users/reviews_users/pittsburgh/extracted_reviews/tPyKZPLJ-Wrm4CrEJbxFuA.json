    "text": "It's strictly a hoagie joint. They have a number of people making subs, and you wait in line (if necessary) until called over by one of the sub makers. You order and they give you a number, then you pay. When your order is ready they'll bring it over to you.   So what makes DiBella's different from a gaggle of other hoagie shops? It's the bread, made fresh daily on site. And also I feel the meat they use is a little better quality than most places. The hoagie rolls come in three sizes so there is no \"half hoagie\" like you might expect. A large number of toppings are available.  You can have your hoagie hot or cold, but hot means grilled not baked.   The salads and sides are prepackaged. The cookies are very large and tasty. I've been here almost a dozen times and it's always very clean - clean enough that you really notice it.  If you're going to get a cookie you might as well make it a combo as it's only a little more to get a cookie AND a drink.",

The bread is absolutely amazing and the sandwich choices are awesome. Love love love this place. It is definitely more expensive than Subway or quiznos, but they put a lot more in their sandwiches too. Its worth the extra money.",

I've tried a few of their sandwiches, but I always come back to the Godfather.  It's what they are famous for and after eating one you understand why.  Those cookies aren't bad either.   I was happy to see this location open in the North Hills and even happier that it is staffed with pleasant people offering outstanding customer service with a solid product.

I substituted roast beef for subways steak and had all the same toppings. sadly, dibellas didn't compare to subway , and I never went back until recently.   about a month ago my boyfriend finally convinced me to go with him and try half of his sandwich, and he swore I'd love it. normally, I'm very stubborn and difficult and SUPER picky on new foods, but I went and ultimately ate half of his large turkey sandwich with lettuce and extra mayo on plain bread. (same as what he gets at subway, our former go-to dinner place.) since that amazing day, I've gone to dibellas at LEAST 6 times per week. no exaggeration. I'm a senior in high school juggling multiple jobs and I'm never home to eat food so I'm always grabbing fast food. (disclaimer: I only weigh 107 so my metabolism is pretty sweet). I absolutely LOVE. THIS. PLACE. im literally pulling into the parking lot as I finish this review. I honestly wish I tried this sandwich years ago. it's amazing.",

Then as I bit into my delectable treat, a smile crept onto my face. Yes, this sub made me smile. That is all I need to say about it's taste.      All in all, this is the best sub around. There is literally no way you can improve on perfection, which is shy this is literally the best sub I've ever had. But if you don't get the oil, you are short-changing yourself big time.",

Will stick with other long time established Pittsburgh greats instead of this low budget knock of a hometown staple.

Here's my breakdown on what you may be looking for when seeking a sub:  Exceptional quality, exceptional taste, fair price, lot of love, slow time = Dibellas  Poor quality, poor taste, bad price, no love, fair speed = Subway  Fair/poor quality, fair taste, fair price, no love, exceptional speed = Jimmy Johns  Conclusion, give yourself an extra ten minutes and eat the best sub around...Dibellas!",

    "text": "I finally had a chance to stop in here over the weekend to find out what their subs were all about and to see what makes them old-fashioned.  The old-fashioned connection for me was the vintage decor of the dining room and the huge high counter where your order is taken.  Other than that I am not sure if it has anything to do with the subs. Curious to know differently.  I thought the sub was decent in size and tasted OK but it didn't stand out as anything different or unique.  The bun was good-tasting but it was very oversized in comparison to the ingredients inside.  I couldn't even see if there was any cheese on the sandwich and I barely could taste any of the steak because it was all overpowered by the bread.  I am not sure if it is worth another visit or not.",

Delivery yes but not nice about it. They were very early which normally is good but let whomever sign the receipt.  But did not leave a receipt copy. Not good at all. Then calling to retrieve the receipt was met with annoyance. Not good again.  They offer sandwiches. Ordinary run of the mill sandwiches. There are tons of places that offer sandwiches.  Be nice to the people who are paying for your food.",

The staff was very friendly there was about 5 of them there and about 4 more of them than customers and that should have shown me a sign. Anyhow the guy suggested I try the Italian or the cheesesteak because those two were the most popular. He offered to make it hot and I said sure since he said it tastes much better but I thought that meant toasted but no they grilled the meats up but it wasn't toasted. I got a bag of Doritos and a small drink as part of the combo \"deal\". All toll it was $16 for 1 hoagie combo, I couldn't believe it. The hoagie wasn't bad but having hot meat and not being toasted I wasn't impressed. The decorum in the place is awesome and the music that goes along with it is too. This place just reminded me of Quiznos just being a hugely overpriced joint. I could have gotten two at many many other places for just around or less than this rip off joint.",

    "text": "Used to be a fan of this place but not anymore. 3rd strike for me. Just purchased 2 sub combos at around $25 and will not go back. The DiBellos cheesesteak was not edible. When I unwrapped it after a six minute drive home the orange colored grease I'm assuming they use to fry the meat and onions in was everywhere so much so that it ruined the sub. Ate a part of the sub because that was our dinner and I normally do not like to throw $25 away but couldn't finish because the oil was everywhere even after trying to soak it up with paper towels. It was a soaked soggy mess due to the over use of the liquid they use on the griddle. When they first opened they were delicious but poor quality and lack of service pretty much defines them now.",

All there bread is homemade and the everything bread is by far the best. Dibellas cheesesteak is as close to chessesteak perfection as you can get. Also dont forget that you can customize your sandwich to your liking. Want swiss instead of american cheese, go ahead. Want bannana peppers or grilled sweet peppers on your sandwich, go ahead. I ordered mine with American cheese, grilled onions and there amazing honey mustard.   Great fresh food. Great atmosphere. Great music! We will definitely be back!",

I typically order the cheesesteak with all the fixings or get a turkey and bacon sub - and love the fact it's thick cut bacon.   One thing to ALWAYS order here: the chocolate chip cookie. Honestly, it's one of the best recipes I've ever had. Glad there are a bunch of convenient locations including Market Square, North Hills and Cranberry as we go here fairly frequently.",

I ordered the godfather grilled with peppers and onions on the everything bread. I'm a huge fan of everything bagels and this bread was fantastic. I was a huge fan and would definitely order it again!  The meat was generous, service was friendly, sub was delicious! I will say I think they forgot my peppers and onions but it's on cause it was just that good.  Not to mention that they carry those delicious jalapeno chips that are just the best thing to have ever happened to chips! I would definitely return!",

    "text": "Ughhh.  The 3.5 star review dilemma.  Guess I'll round up today.  Dibella's subs is a step above your standard Subway chain.  Pittsburgh doesn't really have delis or other sub shops, like Potbelly's, everywhere so I think this location should do really well.  If there was some actual competition, I think I'd go somewhere else.  The bread is fresh and delicious, and it's pretty much the highlight of the sandwich.  I ordered the Godfather sub, which seemed like a safe bet.  The meat is fried, which makes it SO greasy.  So when they lather on the mayo and oil, despite asking for light, it's a little revolting.  It's not that I watch what I eat, but I actually don't like the feeling of my arteries clogging while I eat.  My acid reflux was so annoyed, and I had no desire to finish my whole sub.  But you just can't lie, it still tasted really good.  Only other complaint was that it feels a little grimy.",
