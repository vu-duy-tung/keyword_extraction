Great lunch special of two slices and a drink $5! I have had wedges, salad, wings, hoagie and pizza and continue to order these over and over. It's a lil greasy but that's what makes it good! Right??",

Everyone working is always friendly when myself and coworkers stop by for lunch.  They also have a nice little patio area in the back that's quiet and almost makes me forget I'm in the city.",

My favorite thing about this pizza was definitely the cheese...I loved the flavor and the consistency.   This is my new go-to pizza place!

Just walked in for the first time and got a slice of red sauce/pepperoni and white sauce/tomato, both tasty. They'd heated them up so the crust was crunchy.  Cheese blend on the white pizza was great. Reasonably priced, too.    A few tables to eat in, slices to go, also orders/delivery.  While I was there, I heard someone placing an intricate phone order (like the way Sally from When Harry Met Sally... ordered food) with items like \"well done fries,\" and they seemed quite accommodating.

So maybe we should have ordered the pizza? Maybe that's the only good thing here which gives this place its misleading 4 stars? We got a cheese calzone and wings.  The calzone was completely flat.. the dough was so thin it was translucent, when I poked it I could see a bubble of liquid moving underneath the top dough.. okay so this liquid is the most baffling thing I've ever seen in my food. We cut the calzone into 4 slices and like this liquid, not fat/grease but it was like literal water, the whole inside filling was soaked and overflowing with this water liquid.. the calzone was plain cheese (didn't order mushrooms since they use canned, so nothing in there should cause water..) uhh. Also there was a slight pink tint to the ricotta cheese and basically the entire gloopy liquidy glop of filling, it was all tinted pink. But we got no sauce, sauce on the side. And none of the fillings have ever dyed my food pink so this was just so weird and gross.. so many things wrong I can't even.  I thought maybe I can at least the wings. Husband goes \"these are like walmart wings\" and yes they sure are. There is a laughable amount of meat on the bones. The wings seem to be battered and fried, a LONG time ago, and by the time they arrived they were 100% soggy all the way through. This thick soggy layer of some kind of cardboardy bleh.  Like what is this place doing.. I wish more than anything that we had used a card to order but unfortunately we paid cash, and we feel literally robbed of the $30 we paid for this garbage..  Like I can't understand how a business exists and is still open and has 4 stars when their food is so absolutely awful?? I feel so misled by yelp, this is pretty rare.  Save your money! Swear I've had a lot of pizza and calzones from a lot of places, this is nottttttt what it should be. Really wish I could have my $30 back.",

When i showed up, they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about. They even told me to check my phone as if I could have called another location, which there is only one, so not sure why they suggested that.   Not only did I know for a fact that I ordered from the right number bc I order once a week, but I know for a fact that the man telling me I never ordered was actually the one who took my order! Come on, guys. You think I don't recognize your voices by now? I only come in once a week. Needless to say, being a little miffed over the situation, I haven't returned, but boy is their pizza good.",

I can't speak for delivery quality, but each time I've gone in to for my pick-up order, I was greeted by the incredibly friendly guy - the owner, I presume - at the counter. I love shops with that neighborhoody feel. He knew everyone who came in to pick their orders up, and is really easy to chat with. If I was rating Fazio's on customer service it would be 5 easily, but the food is delicious, too!  We've only had their cheese pizza and chicken parm hoagie, but both were excellent. The pizza crust is really thin, and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese. As other reviewers stated, if you want a traditional, greasy pie, this is one of the best places to sate your craving in Pittsburgh. Despite the thin crust, it's never been undercooked and soggy, and we haven't had to deal with a burnt crust, either. As for the hoagie...their rolls are delicious and really help make the sandwich. I can't wait to try some of their other hoagies, but for now, the chicken parm might be hard to pass up for me.  Overall, Fazio's is the complete package for a pizza shop. Great customer service, a neighborhood vibe, and delicious, reasonably-priced food. You really can't' go wrong! Enjoy!",

I've had pizza that runs the gamut, at enough locales around the country, and unfortunately, Pittsburgh is usually waaaaay off with good pizza recommendations.  Someone from OH actually steered me towards this place for real-deal NY-style pie.  The people are friendly, and the pizza...ohhhhh yes, the pizza.  I ordered three slices w/ spinach, and quickly fell?/levitated to Heaven.  The crust is chewy and crispy, sauce is savory with just enough sweetness, cheese has to be at least (I'm guessing) Grande brand or better (Italian), and the spinach was the \"icing on the cake\".  Unlike Benny Fiero's, which is the runner-up, in my opinion, Fazio's spinach was not only flavorful, but had that almost raw and great organic bitterness that can only come from a fresh variety, akin to broccoli rabe.  Nothing more to say, other than that if you have a pizza craving (or search for the ultimate NYC pie not in NYC), GO HERE NOW.  That is all.",

I have been a loyal and consist customer for about 4 years and have maybe had a handful of decent interactions with the people who work there, nothing overly friendly, (which is to be expected from a local Pittsburgh pizza spot) but usually nothing too bad. To be honest this was my favorite pizza spot in the city but I can't go back anymore. Fazios has a deal, $.90 more than a medium and you can get a large. It sounds great but from my own experience I have found THE PIZZA GETS REALLY FLIMSY AND GREASY IF YOU GET A LARGE. Seriously, almost to the point of being inedible (don't even think about storing it overnight). Thankfully, the medium is bomb (like I said, it was my favorite pizza).   So I make my order of 2 mediums. I go to pick it up. And instead of paying leaving and being thanked for giving them my money, the cashier decides to explain their $.90 deal. I really didn't feel like explaining myself (cause the customer is always right?, Especially AFTER they paid?) and again instead of thanking me for giving him my money and letting me leave to eat, he decides to tell me why it's a bad idea to order 2 mediums. He even tells me how it can save me and my family money. I tell him 'if I buy 2 mediums I'll be back faster lol' to which he replied 'dude we sell 1000 pizzas a week do you think 2 pizzas matter?'.To me, this seems like they don't need my business. Which unfortunately is going to happen",

Delivery and customer service was not bad, but the terrible cardboard re-reheated slice of pepperoni and the buffalo wings with the barely there buffalo sauce MORE than qualify this establishment for the two star rating and a never again! Also the menu with no descriptions leaves a lot to be desired...most customers would like to know if you have breaded, seasoned, or boneless wings etc..",

    "text": "I love it here. I know that sometimes people think that the staff is rude but I really think that they are just no nonsense. The food is good and they are fast. I always think that when I go in the are nice and cheerful. But I do work and live pretty close and I will say that I have came here more often than maybe I should admit. They even have an outside patio that is nice in the summer to go out and eat in the shade. They have a few tables out there so you can bring some friends and have a good time. Family owned, local. You really just need to try this place out.   My favorite is just their lunch specials. You go in and get two slices and a drink. Yum. My favorite topping is the banana peppers. Yummy. But then again anything on a cheesy crust is good in my book. The crust here is so good. It is crispy and thin and it makes me very very happy.   My other favorite lunch special is the 1/2 sub and fries combo. I like the Italian sub with extra tomatoes and onions. Fazio's has some awesome Italian dressing that they whip up and I always ask for more on the side to dip. Wait...I also like their wing special. Seriously, maybe I like to eat everything on the menu! The wings are super crispy and really good. They have a lot of meat on them so you will not be disappointed.   This is another awesome neighborhood pizza shop. Really just try this place out. I promise that the staff is not scary as some other people wrote about. Come and enjoy a lunch special or just order a full pie. You will not regret it!",

    "text": "BEST pizza in Pittsburgh!  My husband and I have been rather depressed - we moved out of Bloomfield and can no longer have our weekly Fazios pizza night!! Now and again, we will drive by and grab a slice to hold us over until the next time we can feast on the cheesy, greasy goodness!  If you like thin crust, lots of cheese, and a non-sweet sauce, this Fazio's is for you. Also, their Italian Calzone is AMAZING.   They are a small family owned shop and do no sort of social media, marketing, or advertising... all their efforts go into their amazing, amazing pizza.  Ten times better than Fiori's, Aiello's, Mineo's, Genoa's, Graziano's, you name it - Fazio's will beat it.",

We called ahead to let them know we were coming to make sure they could fit 10 girls and 4 adults. They had everything already for us...even called to make sure everything was ok as we ran a bit late with traffic. The pizza was delicious and the staff is amazing. Owner even let us taste homemade meatballs..they are super good!! The wonderful woman working there even gave each of the girls a lollipop! My daughter said \"this is my new favorite place\" Thanks for a great lunch we will be back!!",

We ordered small cheese pizza, half meatball hoagie and garden salad. Pizza was good and the meatballs...WOW! You can tell they're homemade not frozen. Will be ordering from here again.",
