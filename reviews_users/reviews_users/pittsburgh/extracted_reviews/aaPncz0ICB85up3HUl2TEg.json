I felt the meal was also more rushed than most hibachi experiences, even considering the quickness of the usual dining experience with hibachi. Fine for a local once in a while spot but I would not go out of my way to go here.",

When leaving the manager was at the front and was a real jerk. He said we should have told someone so he could see the food. I told him the waitress did tell him and the chef had left the table before we ate. He made stupid excuses and said tell him before we eat next time. $32 for lunch that didn't taste good did not make me happy but what else can we do?",

    "text": "This is a typical Japanese steakhouse that has been around for years in Monroeville, though it was my first visit here.  Now they also have a sushi bar, but I couldn't possibly recommend it.  I say this even though I never tried the sushi.  I tried though.  The menu listed all of their items in English only (not good).  I confirmed that the fatty tuna was toro, but the lady did not know which kind.  I ordered that, but I was told a couple of minutes later that they didn't have any.  I then ordered the sea urchin (uni), and, again, a couple of minutes later I was told they did not have any.  On a Saturday night at a sushi bar?  Really?  This is why I can't recommend it.  Maybe they have rolls, but they don't have sushi.    On the hibachi side, everything was just okay.  The chef introduced himself and confirmed our orders.  He then proceeded cooking all of the items, and never interacted with the audience again.  For me, that seemed a bit aloof, though his performance did have a couple of tricks I have not seen before.    For the food, I was mostly disappointed.  The fried rice was overcooked and lacked egg.  The extra soy and the crunchy rice was not very palatable.  The vegetables were fine, but the shrimp was overcooked.  Also, the grill was surprisingly dirty by the end of the routine.  But I was very pleased with my teriyaki mahi mahi.  It was much better than I could have possibly expected given how everything else turned out.  So the place has potential, but it is not consistent enough to recommend.  Also soju on the menu suggests to me that the place is Korean run.  2.5 stars",

    "text": "I was visiting family in town and wanted to go to Shogun, one of my favorite childhood restaurants. Unfortunately, the management could not have been less accommodating. We went on a Thursday night, thinking it would not be crowded. When we arrived, there were only two tables full, no one waiting, and only one other reservation besides ours for the entire night. Given that we have a toddler and an infant, we requested one of the back rooms with bench seating. The hostess went around and around with us, until telling us we could have a back room for an extra $30 (we had 6 people total instead of the \"required\" 8). Annoying, but necessary for our infant, so we said ok. Then, one member of our party was running 5 minutes behind, and the hostess told us we'd have to order within 10 minutes of sitting down, regardless of whether or not our final person was there. Keep in mind the place was NOT busy. We politely told the hostess that she was not being very friendly to her customers - the same attitude and difficulty continued. I could understand these restrictions if they were busy - but they were far from it. You'd think they'd be friendly and grateful for the business. We finally decided to leave and go to another hibachi place because we didn't want to give our money to a place that treated their customers with such disregard. It's a shame that they are not at all accommodating or friendly to their clientele!",

We are usually seated within 15 minutes or less as they fill up then next grill with patrons. The place is very busy on weekends but they seem to have learned to handle the crowd. Long gone are the Japanese chefs, replaced by every and any other ethnicity. Last two times we have a young many who loved the Steelers and spent his coking time talking about them. But gosh he lost track and overcook most entrees. The food is generally ok to good but far from great. We can and will eat here without too much worry. Good in a pinch for something other than table service. I think many people come for the show and uniqueness of the hibachi. But for us, it is not new, unique or exciting. They are showing their tiredness. Because of the general so-so ishness at best of this place we have not eaten the sushi.  The place needs rejuvenation, bring in the spa for a facial and full body message on this place.",

This is your typical hibachi style restaurant, and it's especially fun when you are with a larger group, otherwise, you are seated with random strangers. The chefs usually put on a little \"show\", flipping shrimp into their chef hats, lighting things on fire, etc. The food is good, I usually go with the steak/shrimp combo. You start with a salad with ginger dressing, and soup, then you have your entree. The prices are a bit high for what you get, but I've never had any complaints with how anything has tasted. The wait is somewhat long, every time we have been there, it's been really busy, but they do accept reservations.",

    "text": "When I stepped into Shogun Japanese Steakhouse, it was if I was stepping back in time; not.  Shogun in Monroeville is a nice restaurant, but it's far from truly authentic Japanese cuisine, and that's just fine.  I imagine that the folks who choose to have dinner at Shogun aren't concerned primarily with the food, but are more interested in the theatrics that accompany the food.  As much as it is a restaurant, Shogun is a theatre of sorts, with experienced chefs who put on a skilled show at your table. As we made our way across the kanji (Japanese bridge) to our table, we were eager to experience the food at Shogun. We sat at our seats, and admired the large grill that our chef would be performing at.  Our lovely Caucasian hostess arrived in her Japanese kimono, and took our drink orders.  Katie Lane ordered some type of fruity-vodka drink that arrived in a ceramic Buddha; it was pricey, but she got to take the little Buddha home!  We also ordered a few rolls of sushi which were good- they came with a sauce; something I hadn't seen before.  The rolls were good- we ate them up.  We ordered our dinners next- Hibachi Teriyaki Tuna ($22.99), Hibachi Chicken Teriyaki ($20.99), and a few orders of Hibachi Shrimp ($20.99).  All of our entrees were served with Japanese Green Onion Soup, Shogun Salad with Ginger Dressing, Veggies, Fried Rice, and Hot Tea.  The show began, and we were all impressed.  The talented Japanese chef had pieces of chicken, shrimp and tuna flying through the air.  Flames singed our eyebrows, but we didn't care, we were too caught up in the show.  Shazaam!  A small piece of shrimp flew in the chef's hat- we all clapped, but secretly wondered if the small fella would end up on one of our plates. Our fried rice was placed on our plates first, then the veggies, and lastly, the proteins.  The portions were more than generous.  The food was flavorful, and the optional sauces accompanied the dishes well.  We all had a great time enjoying our food, and laughing with one another. I didn't get to take a look at the check when it was placed at our table, it was picked up by someone else (thanks Mari!)  I know that taking a group of friends to Shogun isn't inexpensive, but the extra money pays for the show.  The food and service at Shogun is good.  If you have a special occasion to celebrate, it's worth a try.",

    "text": "I've been a customer here since around 1995 or so. As others have said, this is a generally nice restaurant that has nevertheless seen better days. It's overpriced if you only consider the food - which is filling, but nothing special - but you're also paying for the ambiance and the hibachi grill performance. It's a solid choice for a group gathering (normal tables seat 8, private rooms seat more) but not really a place to go alone or on a regular basis.   If you are in a small group, be aware that they seat you with other parties to fill a table, presumably to keep the grilling and shows efficient. My most recent table had my party of seven plus one lone diner, which was honestly a bad setup. It's better when the groups are balanced, so that there can be two separate conversations going on. In our case, we just had the one random guy sitting silently at our table with his arms crossed, making the meal palpably awkward as we talked around him.  My most recent experience was also unusually bad food-wise. The salad was soggy and insubstantial, and the hibachi food was extremely salty. (Two hours later, I still have that salty \"gagged on sea water\" feeling in my mouth.) I didn't enjoy it. Plus, the portions were noticeably smaller than they used to be, despite the fact that the price was just as high. But keep in mind that that experience was not typical... Other than the portion size issue, I think we just had a bad chef.",

They were attentive, answered questions and readily cleared plates and refilled drinks.  The chef was also great.  When we realized my kids were scared of the hibachi, he changed up what he did to minimize the flames. Why I only rated two stars was the food quality. We started with two sushi rolls.  They had a two for ten special.  The sushi was totally meh.  It fell apart easier than sushi usually does, and there really wasn't anything special about it.  It was also fairly overpriced for a small roll. The entrees were also overpriced.  The triple combo included filet, shrimp and chicken.  It tasted ok, but it definitely wasn't good enough to warrant the $32 price tag.  I also didn't like their yum yum sauce.  It basically tasted like straight mayo. I'm glad we had a good experience with our servers, but we likely won't be back because of the lack of value compared to cost.",

You can be asked to be seated at the teppanyaki tables (shared with other parties) or at a small table and order sushi.   For teppanyaki, you order which protein you want and all the meals come with a large scoop of fried rice, mixed vegetables, soup, and salad. The chef also gives a little show much like Benihana while he cooks the food.   The servers and chefs here were very nice and he lowered the butter content for me. The reason why I gave 2 stars is because of the food quality and taste. It really wasn't very good compared to what I've had before. Probably even worse than that place in Hawaii. I would not recommend this joint. Their prices are quite high as well, not worth it. You'll get much better Japanese food at Chaya for around the same price or slightly more.",

Food and napkins were rationed. For example, my coworker wanted another type of dressing for his salad and the server shared that it would be up charge. We also asked for additional napkins and they placed one at each coworkers plate setting. It was super awkward and made us feel unwelcome. Furthermore, we the check came the server insinuated that we should tip more than the 18% that was added to our bill. \"We all share\" was the comment .  We will not be back and I would not recommend!",

Over time the meat was tasting worse and worse. The service is always great I'm so terrible but I cannot remember the woman's name who always waited on us. My last attempt to eating there a man told me I would have to wait 15 minutes to be seated with my two year old because there was no one to sit with us. The restaurant was empty and children get a bit anxious. I tried to ask him if we can sit in at least get sushi while we were waiting and he got frustrated with us and told me no. We left soon after going to Yamato and got fantastic service. We will not be back to Shogun which is sad because it was such a great family tradition",

    "text": "My son and I were in the mood for a Japanese Steakhouse and this one came up on a search. My son said the reviews were good. I am convinced it was not for this restaurant. We ordered 2 of the most expensive dishes on the menu steak and shrimp and steak and lobster. You don't receive a piece of meat or a lobster tail. What you do receive is a hacked up piece of meat covered in so much soy sauce that you can taste almost nothing but salt. What I did taste of lobster was a very fishy, tough piece of meat that was not fresh. Did I mention that your meat is covered with over 3 cups of rice saturated in soy sauce? I asked the waitress what sides came with the meal. She never mentioned rice. Even if she had, who covers the meat with it??? Wherever you have to drive, do it to avoid this dying restaurant. The outside looks worn and I should have taken the lack of vehicles in the parking lot as a clear indicator of the poor food and service. I wanted to send my meal back because it was that awful, but they acted like I was stealing from them. Lesson learned and I hope I have warned others. The only positive thing I have to say is that the busboy was on top of things and I appreciated the koi pond.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g53223-d401216-r599705371-Shogun_Japanese_Steak_House-Monroeville_Pennsylvania.html&s=72632ecefcb5710afdf13f76a3b719ffd505bfe081e2c656d2e8437045befa64\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

    "text": "I am not even sure how to adequately express my displeasure here. I arrived for lunch and the place was practically empty. Never a good sign in a busy area like Monroeville.   I get the menu and it's totally smeared by either hr ease or cleaning product. I look through and nothing sounds super impressive, so I stick to basics including a making roll, miso soup and a hibachi appetizer. That comes out with the soup and the roll all within 5 minutes. Weird pacing, but whatever. One bite into the appetizer and I know I will not be taking another bite. It tastes both burned and undercooked at the same time. I bite into a piece of the roll and it's ok. But after the appetizer I'm totally freaked out by any seafood item here. So I figure I'll just enjoy my tea and soup....but even the tea tastes sour! I drink unsweetened tea daily, so it is NOT the lack of sugar throwing me off. It just tastes metallic from sitting around for a very long time. Eeek.  I will not be back and recommend you continue on up the road to Taipei-Tokyo for your sushi needs.",

    "text": "I am giving this place 2 stars because of the bar.  My parties drinks were delicious!  That being said, wild horses would have to drag me back to that place.    We had a 15 minute wait. Not bad for a Friday night.  Went to the bar had a delicious blue drink, paid,shortly after we were seated.  The waitress was friendly enough took out order brought over soup/salad.  I enjoyed the soup,  I thought the ginger dressing tasted of mustard, didn't like that at all,  but was still not really bothered. Then we sat,  and sat, when we inquired when our chef was going to start preparing our meals we were told there were no more chefs in the back and had to wait for one to finish with another table, so we sat.  At about the hour mark (thank God for electronics to keep the kiddos from complaining) we get up to leave,  that is when the manager comes over to apologize and offers us 20% off if we stay.  I agree but only if the chef is at our table within the next 5 minutes.  Exactly 5 minutes later he comes,  asks about our meat temps and proceeds to dish out sauces.  He hands my party a blob of mayo?  What is this,  I ask?  This is mayo, he replies that it is mayo based, NO sir this is straigt mayo.  Now I have been frequenting hibachi restaurants for YEARS never had yum-yum sauce look or taste like that.  I was done. Asked him not to bother continuing with our meal (he hadn't started cooking anything) we left.    Manager had to the nerve to yell over to the bartender to make sure we paid for our drinks prior, which she had already asked me and I said yes!",

On 12/26 at 8:15 pm, my wife and I drove from Squirrel Hill to enjoy a nice dinner together and found everything but that. Allow me to break it down: 1) Shogun Punch extremely too sweet 2) Scallops came out to table frozen, not fresh 3) Scallops way overcooked 4) Shrimp way overcooked 5) Steak cut into small dice pieces and way overcooked  6) Hibachi cook made racial comments about Jews, Mexicans and Orientals. (He specifically mentioned your busboy with the ponytail on the Jew comment)  7) Server came to the table whining about the bad service she gave because she had no help and it was Monday night and did not expect to be busy. 8) Whole dinner was rushed because they all wanted to go home. (Busboy specifically complaining in ear shot of whole table). 9) Oh and I forgot to mention, when the raw food was brought out on the cart, it was all stacked on trays with no paper in between them. All the food was stuck on bare sheet pans stacked on top of each other separating orders. 10) Grease was dripping down on the dinner plates from the hood unit above. I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR ANYTHING! NEVER HAVE I EXPERIENCED SUCH AN EVENING. BEYOND UNPROFESSIONAL, BEYOND RIDICULOUS!",

The food was ok and our chef was not very talkative or entertaining. The worst part, though, was the bathroom - it was absolutely DISGUSTING . My feet stuck to the floor, the mirrors were filthy, the stalls were filthy and dusty - it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months - SO GROSS!! It really makes you wonder - if the bathroom is that dirty, what does the kitchen look like. We won't be returning there anytime soon - such a turn-off!",

The food is good (and plentiful) and the wait staff goes out of their way to accommodate you.   They are currently going through new ownership and working to get their liquor license, which may pose a problem for anyone who comes looking for some drinks...but that should change in a few weeks.  That said, we had an enjoyable experience and would recommend this spot to anyone near the Monroeville Mall who is looking for this type of meal.  Enjoy the leftovers!",

We've gone there to celebrate, and for comfort food, as well as take out when we can't dine in. The take out is just as good as the dine-in.
