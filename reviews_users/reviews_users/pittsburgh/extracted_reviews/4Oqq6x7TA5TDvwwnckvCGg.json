I got a gin and tonic and a French onion soup. The reason I give this place only 3 stars is because the onion soup is just very blend any led tasteless why it can't be that difficult to make a tasty onion soup. My drink is ok and the staff is correct but not overly friendly. You don't have to come here for the atmosphere on a Sunday at 12.30 pm, that's for sure.",

    "text": "My first visit after it changed from Habitat to Floor 2. Since its in the same space it still overall feels the same but I am a fan, has an open kitchen you can see from the dining room. Service is still good, but a bit inconsistent; very quick service when I sat down and ordered, but went a good 15 minutes after receiving food with no one checking in on us. Main course (family size fish) and sides were delicious. Bread and butter is an extra $4, a little bit nit picky for an expensive restaurant to begin with. My $10 drink was almost all ice, so was not impressed with that, and the desserts were bland and very small portion size.   So a solid 4* in my book with the food being delicious and service being generally good. If you want a drink, just get a glass of wine; their cocktails are overpriced and watered down. And go get dessert at the MilkShake Factory a couple blocks down; much cheaper and you'll enjoy it much better. :)",

    "text": "I went to Fl 2 during summer restaurant week and will definitely be back. My husband ordered from the $35 restaurant week menu which included a poblano soup (simple but great flavor), lamb neck bolognese (he loved the spiciness of the lamb), and japanese cheesecake with matcha and cherry preserves (more of an angel cake consistently but very tasty and different). I decided to order from the traditional menu and started with the ratatouille (full of perfectly cooked veggies and a delicious sauce) and the octopus with lentils (the octopus was slightly overcooked but the lentils were amazing- maybe the best I've ever had!). The server was excellent and very accommodating and made excellent drink suggestions.  All of the cocktails sounded super interested and I ended up with the Lunch with Joe which was a smoked drink. They bring the class upsidedown with the smoke in it and then flip it over to pour in the prosecco mixture. The presentation was really cool and the drink was very tasty.",

    "text": "The food here is a solid four. Our service, while friendly, was legitimately abysmal. We started the evening while standing at the host desk for several minutes while a hotel guest, who seemed to be flirting with him,  asked the host dozens of questions about the place - the host noticed us but at no point made an effort to acknowledge us or say he'd be with us in a moment. Another staff member came up, saw us waiting, and also ignored us. Seated, our server took our drink orders, then came back, said our drinks would be right up, and wanted to take our orders. We had a few questions and wanted to confer, so we asked her to come back. She came back ten minutes later, still not bringing us our drinks, and said she was ready to take our order. Again, we inquired about our drinks, and she again said they would be right up. We ordered, and she headed to the POS to put in our order - still no drinks. Finally got our cocktails (VERY GOOD)  about 20 minutes after were were seated and were left no time to enjoy them because our apps were dropped soon after. Tartare and winter vegetables, both very good. No serving utensils were offered. I find this really odd for a restaurant that emphasizes sharing. We scraped the food off of the share plates with our forks. Our server returned and we asked her for a wine list. When we had questions about the wine she had to ask the manager to come over, and we were grateful that he did because he was not only helpful, he also cleared our empty dirty plates the server had neglected when she dropped the wine list. He brought our wine out right away and our entree course soon followed. Mushrooms and mashed potatoes. The broccoli rabe we ordered never made it to the table. Our shared entree was the trout. Again, we were offered no serving utensils. Tell me how you would divide up a whole fish with a butter knife. After taking a shot at it, we flagged down our server and got two spoons and a sharp knife. The food was delicious but the trout was really difficult to portion out because the skin was tough (but tasty) and hacking away at it was frustrating. The server came by to ask us how we liked it and we mentioned we would not order the trout again. She came back and said that her manager would like to buy us dessert (very nice) since we were unhappy with the fish. She cleared our plates, and then brushed off the table on to the carpet WITH HER BARE HAND, smearing mashed potato across it. She brought our dessert settings, set them on top of the smear of potato, then realized that was kind of gross, I guess, got a rag, picked up our flatware, wiped the table, and set the flatware back down.   I didn't like my dessert choice (sounded better on the menu than it tasted), but my husband had the chocolate tart and liked it.  The manager stopped over and we mentioned that our server was really very nice but needed some training to have the polish the place seems like it is trying to achieve. I hope they make it because the food is really good and that manager was working his butt off!",

    "text": "UPDATE: I attempted to call based on the below suggestion from the restaurant, and I left a message that was never returned.  My husband and I had high expectations for Floor 2, but we were pretty let down. There were definitely things that were fine about the experience, but overall we were left disappointed in our evening.  Two high points of the evening were the cocktails we had at the bar before dinner, as well as our attentive yet not obtrusive waiter. The cocktails were well balanced and inventive, and had excellent presentation. I unfortunately cannot remember the waiter's name, however he was quick to tend to our needs, and was on script for the ambiance of the restaurant.   Unfortunately, most of the food left a lot to be desired. We started with the mussels, which came with grilled bread in a tomato broth. The sauce almost tasted soapy, and 2/3 of the mussel shells were empty. While I understand not all mussel shells always have the meat due to preparation loss, 2/3 is quite extreme. We are usually the people asking for more bread so we can soak up the delicious sauce that comes with the mussels, but we actually didn't even end up finishing the bread because we didn't want to partake in the gross sauce.  I had the sea bass entree, and my husband had the octopus. Both were fine, but fairly uninteresting dishes. The sea bass was just an extremely bland dish.  The ambiance of the restaurant is great, and the view from the second floor is a different one, but I don't think we'll be back.",

    "text": "Fl. 2, or Floor 2 at the Fairmont offers an incredibly unique dining experience in the heart of the city.  We were traveling in for the EQT 10 Mile Race and stayed at the Fairmont.  I travel often for work and have eaten at many of the places in Pittsburgh and this is absolutely one of the, if not the best in town.  It's a brand new restaurant offering a fresh design that is unlike anything else in the city.  It's modern and refined, while offering a casual feel.    The Service:  My wife and I were treated to exceptional service for both dinner and Lunch.  Special thanks to Gary, Dom, and Rico for the recommendations and full Raw bar experience - outstanding!  EVERYONE at the restaurant seems to genuinely take pride in this new concept and went out of their way to make sure we had a great experience.   It was enjoyable to see the staff excited for us to try the next course and every detail of each dish/drink was explained to us before trying it.    The Drinks:  Incredibly unique drink menu with our favorites being Ode to Alexandria and the Smoked Pimientos were drinks unlike anything we've had before.  So refreshing and artistic!  There is also an entirely local beer selection that highlights the budding Pittsburgh Craft beer scene.  Kuddos to the team for designing this with a super-local feel.  Most unique drink menu in town and the wine selection is simply fantastic.  The Restaurant:  Beautifully designed with Copper highlights and an industrial/designer feel that feels very \"Pittsburgh\" while looking nothing like anything else in Pittsburgh.  The Centerpieces of Fl.2 are the 25-person Round bar and a cozy marble fireplace.  One of the most beautiful places to enjoy a meal in town.  On a side note, my wife and I also thought the music playing during the meal was a nice compliment to the meal.  Overall, Fl.2 provides great dining atmosphere, with warm lighting and the feel you're in one of the \"hottest spots\" in the city!  The Food:  Wow - unlike anything Ive ever had.  Chick Pea Fricassee, the Chicken(best I've ever had) and Pork Belly were among our favorites.  The Red Kuri Squash, Pasta, and Desserts were also memorable.  Among the most unique aspects of this concept is the Raw bar.  There are several species of Oysters, Scallops, and shrimp that were beautifully presented.  Apparently the menu will change seasonally and offers such a variety of unique dishes, it would take one 4-5 visits to try everything. Meals are meant to be shared and this is part of the concept.  For dinner, we ordered 4-5 different dishes and it provides a great opportunity to try many different items!  We will definitely be back and can't thank the staff and servers enough for making it one of the best meals we've ever had!  Recommend getting a reservation and get there an hour early to enjoy a drink at the beautiful bar.  Check it out...you won't regret it!   <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-cdn.getbento.com%2Faccounts%2Fa82123819cc1aa73ec31b732ff608fe5%2Fmedia%2Faccounts%2Fmedia%2FD0ph5FKSZadyrtla3Xuw_Floor%25202%2520Menus.pdf&s=c3f5e24d38c917c3cdc43d27f66f90cc846b434ff395a8a1fd041f71ba3716a2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">media-cdn.getbento.com/a...</a>",

Something less bitter would have been preferred BUT it's better than getting E. coli so I'm still happy. The horseradish/blue cheese sauce was really good too; the flank steak was cooked well but had a few pieces that were just fat. My friend got the bib salad with salmon and really liked it.

It had a cold thick skin that was on top and when I turned the fish over it was brown...  The fish came with some dried up looking mussels and octopus and little square pieces of potato in some watery looking broth.  My husband said his lamb (which was hard to find because it was buried in about two cans of beans ) was not bad but seriously, he will eat anything.

My husband got the Kai rise and I went with  Lunch with Joe - just next time i would skip the smoked rosemary (just didn't appreciate that type of scent/taste) and the chickpea fricassee. The chickpeas were rich and creamy and the bread was delicious. The bartender and server were really nice and had great suggestions while we were going over the menu. Can't wait to come back and try other cocktails or maybe brunch.",

    "text": "I recently stayed at the Fairmont Pittsburgh for 3 nights. One night, my girlfriend and I decided to stop into Fl. 2 to grab a nightcap before heading up to our room. The decor of the bar / restaurant was nice and the drink list was satisfactory, but we had a very unpleasant experience thanks to our bartender. He asked us for our IDs and rudely (and aggressively) questioned my girlfriend about her age and home address (listed on ID). Normally we wouldn't be upset about getting carded, as any upstanding establishment is entitled to do. But the way this man carried on was unacceptable, especially given the circumstances (you're working at the restaurant in an upscale hotel... this isn't some nightclub in Station Square). How can a high-end hotel that caters to travelers from all over the country (and probably the world) be so unaccustomed to seeing an out of state ID (Colorado)? I would avoid Fl. 2's bar unless you'd like to be interrogated...",

The bar looks very impressive which is why I was so disappointed with our experience. Our original bartender was by far the most arrogant and egotistical person I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. At no point was he friendly, welcoming or helpful. He walked around thinking he was better than everyone and everything, like a God of a bartender amongst us, which I found funny after trying his poorly made cocktails. If you're staying at the hotel nearby and are ok with spending $16 for a cocktail, take an $8 Uber to another bar near by and purchase an $8 cocktail which I guarantee will be better both in taste and in service.",

It was not at all crowded and several bartenders stood there and did nothing to acknowledge us or get someone to sat us until we spoke up. When we finally were seated, the table was dirty. We asked the hostess if someone could wipe the table. The hostess got someone, who told us that the table was clean and just stained and then proceeded to demonstrate this by wiping a mark which came clean. When we pointed out that the mess came up, she said it was a stain and walked away. How do you not only refuse to wipe a table, but try to show how it's stained, then upon learning it's not stained, you walk away?! SO RUDE and SO GROSS.   The actual service from our server was really great! He made sure that we had everything we needed and check on us often. He was the best part of our visit, as the food was lackluster and bland.   I don't think we will be back, and I would urge others to not waste their time and money.",

Beautiful space- food was very good - pretty good size crowd. All off to a good start.   Now the not so good. Looks like there is one run ragged woman behind the bar serving the whole place. Everyone I talk to at the bar is asking what department I work for at PNC bank and isn't it great that we get 1/2 price drinks and free apps   Bottom Line- whoever is running this place might want to consider staffing properly for the headcount not the revenue because you're going to end up with a  bunch of guests at the finest hotel in Pittsburgh wondering how they ended up in a college bar inside. I'll wait half an hour to order wings and a draft colors light but wouldn't expect it at a place of this caliber.   BTW- the food was very good and the woman behind the bar did a fabulous job of making the most of a bad situation.",

    "text": "Went to Fl.2 for lunch and shared a bunch of apps, entrees, and desserts, and so was able to get a good sense of the lunch menu/food.   Overall, a much better menu than habitat and better makeover to the restaurant, including the new bar, which is pretty Grand.  Here are the dishes I tried and the grades.  1. heirloom carrots. B+. Very solid appetizer. The sweet ricotta on the bottom made the dish. Wished the carrots were cooked more, as the server said they would be blistered (but they weren't). I would order it again.  2. Chickpea fricassee. B. My table mates liked this a lot more than me. I thought it was average. The tomato base kind of obscured garlic aioli.   3. Chicken and Brie tartine. B+. This was a fresh open faced sandwich, with argula and roasted chicken. Very large portion. My only complaint was I didn't get any real Brie taste in it-- would up the brie (and aioli) and decrease the amount of chicken. But overall, very solid.  4. Hamburger. A. Burger was great. Liked how it was on a sesame seed bun. I'm not sure, but I felt like they may have sous vide it, as it was really moist. The shoe string fries were terrific!   5. Steak frites. B. Good flavor to the steak, but was disappointed that there was no chimichurri sauce, as advertised. I guess they cook the steak in the sauce, but didn't really get that flavor from the dish. But an overall good steak, cooked properly. Same great fries.  6. Beignets. B. Just okay. I thought they didn't need the chocolate sauce in them, as there already was a honey sauce on the plate.   7. Babka. B-. Too dense for my taste. I'm not sure if a babka is supposed to be like that. But good  flavor.  8. Fruit tart. A+. I may be a sucker for a good tart, but it was terrific. Creamy lemony base, fresh raspberries, and perfect crust. Really nice dessert.  9. Coffee. A+. Not sure where they get their coffee, but it's first rate.   Service was a tad slow, but otherwise fine. Overall, a huge improvement over habitat and I would recommend giving it a shot. Will have to try it for dinner.",

I ordered the farm egg omelette and can comfortably say it's one of the top 5 omelettes I've had in my entire life. I think omelettes are one of the most perfect food combinations ever contrived, so I've had a ton of omelette in my day, but this one really stood out. To round out the plate, it came with equally good, if not better, tasting fried potatoes that almost stole the show. My girlfriend got the avocado toast, and there must be a wizard chained to the wall in the back, because that avocado was PERFECTLY ripe, which never happens. It came with tomatoes, and a cream topping that made me jealous I got an omelette (until I started to eat my omelette and was then immediately placated) Anyway, can't wait to get back here!",

    "text": "Hands down, one of the best meals I've had in my life! I had a few friends come in from Las Vegas who work in the food industry there and they were really excited to see what Pittsburgh had to offer. The idea to go to dinner was pretty last minute so a lot of well known places were booked up. Luckily, on Open Table I saw a reservation for Floor 2 open that night.   The first thing you'll notice is that the place is beautiful. You feel like you are in a Mad Men episode and nothing you are wearing is cool enough. Everything is shareable which is the way everything in life should be. We ordered so many good things. Some of my favorites would be the chickpea fricassee and the agnolotti. The pasta was perfectly cooked  and delicate. Plus, anything with brown butter is beautiful. The food was impeccable, the vibe was amazing and the service was fantastic.. Out of close to 10 dishes, there wasn't a single miss. I can't wait to keep going back to this place and eating everything possible!",

Among our five, we ordered the Pupusa (2 thumbs up), the Breakfast Sandwich (great), an American Breakfast (standard) and two would-be grilled romaine steak salads. Given the recent romaine issues, the chef substituted what we were told would be a mix of spring mix and iceberg, but was more akin to bok choy or something similar. Unfortunately, the bitterness of the lettuce far outweighed any semblance of steak taste, though I'm not sure it was that much to speak of, unfortunately. This doesn't mean I won't try Floor 2 again - the space alone is worth the trip! But tread carefully on this particular \"Floor.\"",

I feel some places have amazing food and the place settings can hurt the overall experience.  Right off the bat this place has a lot going for it.  Then, add an amazingly friendly hostess, and waitress and things are even better!   But I feel like that's where the experience stopped.  Our Saturday brunch started with luke warm coffee.  The waitress quickly replaced it with a fresh piping hot carafe!   The cinnamon roll was HUGE!!  It arrived in a cast iron pan that gave it a look of straight out of the oven.  Imagine the sadness we had when it was only barely warm.   And finally, the main dishes with omelettes and potatoes arrived.  The potatoes were basically large fried versions of something you might find at an amusement park or a fast food place late at night. The omelettes were passable but overall another miss as well and very rich.   It's very sad for me to write a negative review but the food part of the experience just wasn't good.  If you have loads of money I'd say give it a try - maybe it'll be better for you and you can at least enjoy the ambiance and the very nice coffee cups  But at the prices being charged (which isn't too much different than other similar places downtown) I'd say look at recent reviews for this place and maybe something has changed.  If not, maybe venture somewhere else.",

    "text": "I had dinner at Floor 2 last week for my birthday and it was such a treat! We had reservations for 7:30pm and were seated right away. There were a few occupied tables in the bar area and people scattered around the bar, but the dining room was mostly empty.  It is, as other reviewers mentioned, an absolutely gorgeous space. The high ceilings and warm lighting give Fl2 a very upscale feel.  I adored the details such as the open kitchen with the hanging copper cookware and being able to see the chefs at work, and the fact that our table was set with mismatched place settings that somehow seemed to work perfectly together.  We ordered the tartare and a bottle of cab to start. The app came out fresh with thin, but crisp crackers and a whipped spread.  While I'm not typically a fan of tartare, this was good and was light enough to not fill us up, but curb our hunger and make us excited for dinner.  I decided on the sea bass entree which came over a type of stew - mussels, calamari and potatoes in a red base.  It was so flavorful and cooked to perfection.  My date ordered the lamb and totally loved it.  I tried a bite and it was smokey, tender and a little spicy.  Great flavors and an even better presentation.  As the evening went on, more tables were occupied and we got to see some other dishes come from the kitchen. I think if I came back, I'd try one of their salads because they looked so good!  We finished with the apple sherbet dessert and while I wasn't keen on dessert at first, it was incredible.  Definitely something to try if you get the chance to come here!  Our service was great and our waitress was very engaging.  She offered excellent recommendations and was extremely accommodating (asking if we were on a time constraint or had the evening to enjoy the food and atmosphere, etc).  Overall it was a flawless visit and I wouldn't change a single thing.  Absolutely recommend if you're looking for a nice experience in a beautiful setting with great food!",

We both started off with the zero proof cocktails. I had the berry smash, which was raspberry, blueberry, mint, lemon, and soda. The drink was beautiful and delicious. It was sweet but refreshing as well. My friend had the clean and green, which was very light and cleansing.   For brunch, I had the poached eggs, which was oxtail jam, spinach, gougere, and hollandaise. Wow, this was definitely one of my favorite versions of eggs benedict in the city. The hollandaise was heavenly and the gougere was a nice change from a traditional english muffin. My friend had the avocado toast and enjoyed her meal. She had just wished hers maybe came with a side. Overall, an excellent place to grab brunch. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is that our server forgot about us. Once we got our food, he never came to check on us, refill our water, or even give our check. I had to ask another waiter to get him to get our check.",

    "text": "We came here for brunch and after a miscommunication in timing of brunch, we ended up with breakfast only. While the website does say the hours for breakfast and brunch, it's a little weird to start brunch on the weekends at 11 and I feel they need to have that more displayed on the website in terms of put it on the menu. Specifically when you pull up the menus from open table or yelp, there is no way to see that brunch doesn't start till 11 unless you go to a specific sub link on the website. That needs to be prominently viewed, especially when most places start brunch earlier.   While we were fine with this miscommunication because partly our fault, the host staff was a little rude to us and balked at our \"stupidity\" that we didn't know brunch was at 11 and was not any way accommodating to us asking further questions on the matter. It was a misunderstanding on our part but they were out of line and simply rude towards us.   Next we felt like our waitress was pushing us out the door from the moment we sat down. She rushed us to choose our meal and brought us our food quickly. And when we initially asked about mimosas to the waitstaff and hostess, they said not until brunch at 11. Well we saw other tables had mimosas and bloody Mary's, so obviously they either don't know their own restaurant or they lied to us, neither bodes well. When we did ask for mimosas towards the end after seeing other tables, our waitress brought us the mimosas and then promptly the Check thereafter before we even had a sip or two. Definitely felt like she wanted us gone ASAP   The one redeeming quality was the food  and the mimosa (when we finally got one) were good (not worth the price or poor waitstaff). But even then you didn't get a lot of food for your money. However nothing can make up for how poorly we felt we were treated by the waitstaff.  Honestly if you're looking for a good brunch experience, I don't advise coming here as we experienced much better places on our visit.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Wednesday with my wife for dinner.  Ever since I had been to a Yelp party here, I had wanted to bring my wife and Pittsburgh Restaurant week gave me the perfect chance.  The inside of Floor 2 is what I would consider classy.  It is L shaped with the front part being a giant square shaped bar and then the back part is the dining area.  Whenever I first walked in on this evening I thought that it was pretty empty only to turn the corner and find it reasonably full.  In any case, they have an array of interesting lighting here and then a bunch of tables and a central area which has half chair/half booth seating.  Last but certainly not least, Floor 2 has an open kitchen along with a chef's bar looking into it where you can also sit.  Since it was Pittsburgh restaurant week, both my wife and I opted to go off of their 3 course pre-fixe menu.  I ended up going with the poblano soup for my starter, lamb neck bolognese for my entree and then the only dessert option was the Japanese Cheesecake.  The menu didn't say too much about each but that the poblano soup came with guajillo oil, the lamb neck bolognese was with pappardelle, mushrooms and Parmesan while the Japanese cheesecake came with matcha and preserved cherries.  Our soups came out first and looked Christmasy with the green base and red colored oil.  The base was blended nicely and really tasted of poblanos while the oil added some much appreciated heat to the dish. While I enjoyed the dish, I don't know that it is something I would have ordered from the menu.  Next up was the lamb neck bolognese.  With the way the pasta was twirled on the plate, it didn't look like much.  Thankfully that was deceiving and there was a lot more there than I expected.  The noodles were a bit more al dente than I liked but the sauce and other ingredients were great.  My lamb was tender and the sauce had a surprising heat to it which crept up on me.  For dessert the Japanese cheesecake was plated beautifully with the green matcha sifted onto a black plate with the cheesecake in the middle and the front covered with cherries.  The cheesecake here was surprisingly light and also tasty.  I enjoyed it with both the preserved cherries and the matcha powder.  However, I wasn't a big fan of all three together and so I took care to eat pieces with only one of the toppings and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I definitely ordered some things from the restaurant week menu that I otherwise wouldn't have and would be interested to try more.",

It was on a bed of bitter greens, but the honey dijon dressing really balanced everything out. It was also complemented by a generous sprinkling of pomegranate and apple slices.   Service was friendly and the ambiance is modern, yet warm. I like the updates they made because it seems sleeker and fits in well with the hotel. I'm excited to try dinner there now!  Celiac/Gluten Free review: They were super accommodating when I told them I had celiac disease. They don't have a GF menu, but they can accommodate dietary requests, which is nice (they said they don't even have peanuts in the kitchen because of allergies).

    "text": "Went for a pre-show dinner, so did not have our usual lingering time over dinner and so just stuck to a drink, a main and a desert. The place is just outstanding in terms of decor. There are three different seating areas and a bar area. Each it's own outstanding decorating achievement. Must see to appreciate. I think the ambiance is in perfect keeping with the restaurants 'modern American' theme. Plus they have an open Kitchen concept in the farthest back dining area.  Of course we were there for dinner but they have a Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Brunch and Bar menu.  The have a Raw bar with items such a oysters and scallop crudo. They keep things tight so the menu is not over large and everything is prepared to your order.  Some of the mains are:  agnolotti (a refined version of ravioli); octopus with lentils (did not have it, but it looked great at the next table); roasted chicken; lamb shank; and the sea bass which we had and enjoyed immensely.  The Sea Bass comes with, and in, and on, saffron potatoes, with fennel in a rich outstanding bouillabaisse broth. In the broth also several mussels, and very tender squid (calamari).  It's really hard to overstate how delicious this meal was. You will want a spoon and some toasted bread for dipping to enjoy the broth to it's fullest.  Service was outstanding with a highly knowledgeable and sharp staff.  Our server could recite every minute detail of every dish and was prompt and courteous and very helpful.   For a desert we split a chocolate torte, which is sort of an understated name for a silky delicious concoction of milk chocolate ganache, dark chocolate mousse with luxardo cheeries (could have eaten a bowl more of these) and some fresh whipped topping. Oh my goodness. This was just outstanding and went very well with a beautifully made espresso.   This was our first time at the 'new' themed and chefed restaurant in the Fairmont hotel, and what a delicious discovery it was.",

    "text": "Exceptional.  I went as a group to fl 2, and I just had a great time all the way through. The restaurant is located on the second floor (yeah you guessed it) of a hotel, and the hotel+restaurant aesthetic is just amazing. Fl 2 is super modern, clean, and so open. The bar has one of the most beautiful displays I've ever seen, and overall, the space is just overwhelming in polish.  My waiter was super cool, and was very attentive with our table. As for the food, wow for the selection. They have all the favorites, from salad to steak, and even vegetarian favorites (ratatouille!) and fun seafood options like mussel. If you come with a group, you'll definitely be able to experience the amazing array of food options.  I had a table full of food, but some highlights were the chickpeas, which if you like a tangy, sour feel, is very fun. The ratatouille was amazing, which coming from a meat lover, means a lot. The veggies weren't sliced thin like they do in the movie, but they were baked well and the sauce was just so wholesome and comforting to eat. As for the other entrees I chose, I wasn't too impressed by them. The 28 oz ribeye had high expectations, and I thought that the meat just wasn't seasoned fully and seared well enough. The meat quality was good, but the texture was a bit tight and it wasn't too savory chewing through the meat. The sea bass was alright, but the jumbalaya choice for the soup was a mistake in my opinion. Mixing in calamari, mussles, and even potatos (???) into a tomato soup was quite a weird combination with the bass, and I wasn't too happy with that.  Overall, the presentation and atmosphere really makes this place a must if you happen to be downtown in Pittsburgh.",

She shocked my by allowing the server to choose a special tasting menu for the occasion (she's a pretty picky eater). Jarod, our server, was outstanding!   Here's how it went:  - Cold lobster salad with fennel. Perfectly seasoned and delicious.  - Chick peas in tomato sauce. What a surprise for the taste buds! Middle Eastern flavors and to die for  - Roasted cauliflower was an explosion of flavor. And I don't even like cauliflower!  - Full trout was tender and mild. We had them remove the head   My mother, who doesn't drink, was going to order her normal iced tea and joked about how she would have ordered a marshmallow martini if they had one (like Applebee's! ). Well, Jerod made it happen and it was the hit of the entire meal!!!   Just when we thought it was over, they brought a gorgeous blueberry meringue dessert. Heavenly.   We also had breakfast the next day and it was delish! Highly recommend the avocado toast   Thank you FL2 for an awesome experience!",

But everything else was a treat. It had a classy, vibrant, yet modern feel with fantastic service and a lively ambiance. They say tapas style but I'd say the portions are pretty big compared to what I'm used to in DC.   My favorite dish of the night was surprisingly the chickpeas! They were perfectly cooked in a impressive savory tomato-balsamic herby sauce. The sauce had depth and kept us coming back for more.   The other dishes we got were mouth-watering also, from the ratatouille to the sea bass with a nice crispy skin to the pork belly.",

Came for a private event which seemed unorganized and fl2 completely unprepared.  The bartenders were totally unwelcoming to our group.  The male bartender completely ignored us if we had a free drink ticket and even though it took 3 separate tries and a total of about 40 min I was able to finally get a drink from the female bartender- which if I'm being honest- was not worth the wait but it might've been the sour attitude that made it not so tasty.  It's not like I wouldn't have tipped but it was a real struggle and it seemed like they were actively trying to be rude by avoiding us so I didn't tip but I would've!  It was not a good look for them and made me not want to return.    While I appreciate the opportunity to check out a new place with the private event (co-hosted by floor 2) I really felt unwelcomed and more like we were a bother - I really don't know why they hosted if they didn't want us there.  Out of the 5 things we sampled I enjoyed the chick pea bite as well as the pork belly bite - although I don't think they're on the menu anyway but they should be because they were good.    I wish it was a better experience because I would love to support Floor 2",

However, it was a little more broiled than grilled and I would've preferred more of a grilled taste. I also had the rice pudding dessert, which was great. It had a granola and bruleed citrus topping that really enhanced the taste and flavor. They were also running a $5 wine special and the wines were delicious!  We did have an issue with our service. We had a 6pm reservation in advance of a 7:30 show, which we communicated at the beginning. We were one of only a couple tables in the restaurant so it shouldn't have been an issue. There was some glitch with our dessert order and it came our very late so we ended up being late for our show.",

Neither of us were fans of this desert, but I'm not sure that's the restaurant's fault as much as me not liking this style of cheesecake. Looking forward to stopping in again!",

    "text": "I went here for a private event, but also ordered from the bar and off of them menu during the event. When I first got there, I went to the bar to get a drink. It took 18 minutes for anyone to come over to me, no one gave me a menu or water. I actually had to borrow a menu from someone next to me at the bar, which is no big deal, but it seemed like the bartender was purposely ignoring anyone from the private event.   When the manager finally came over to take my order, someone I knew had shown up. Even though we told her we would be on separate checks, she put both drinks on my check anyways (more on this later).   We were seated for the private event, and I asked for a waiter so we could order off of the menu. Our waiter Don was amazing! This was the only good thing about Floor 2, in my opinion. He was helpful, friendly, and nice to us.   We ordered a simple green salad, that is supposed to include apple, arugula, and parmesan. What came was a plate of arugula, with little to no dressing or anything else. It tasted like arugula with water on it. We also ordered a cheese plate, this was good, no complaints there. Finally we got fries. They were cold, and there was nothing special about them anyway.  So, I go to close out with the waiter and he tells me that the bar will not let him transfer the tab and I have to go pay there, which is fine. I go to the bar, where I can hear the bartender now complaining about the people from the private event. He walks around me, not making eye contact and then finally says I will get to you in a minute. When he finally comes over I ask to close my tab and he tells me that both drinks are still on it, I tell him again that I only had one drink, and he gets the manager. They cancel out the ticket completely (from what I can tell), and then recharge me for my drink, which would be fine, but it is no longer happy hour, so my $5 beer rings up at $9, but at this point I am sick of the guys attitude, so I just pay and leave.   Really, this was a bad experience. I left having overpaid and went to get dinner somewhere else.",

We shared the fried oysters and I ordered the braised lamb shank and my husband had Striploin for the entree. We ordered wild mushrooms as an additional side and substituted my meal's side with mashed potatoes. The meals already come with some sides but it's nice to have extra.  The only thing we didn't love that with the exemption of the mushrooms everything was just lukewarm. This was mostly my husband's complain. Besides that, I thought this was the best food I had for a long time!! The presentation was beautiful and so delicious. The final verdict was that he doesn't want to return because of the food not being hot but I do. Actually, I can't wait to go back again and will recommend this place to my friends.  The only thing I wish I knew was checking our valet parking ticket.  I think you can ask the hostess or waitress to call in for the car.  After we paid $24 for parking the front desk staff wasn't helpful. He didn't call to valet, just handed the ticket back. We had to wait outside in the freezing cold because there was a bit of a traffic jam in front of the hotel and nobody was moving.",

She made me a perfect caipirinha with the right amount of sweetness and like. Perfect for that humid brunch time!  The graduate had a Smokey floral cocktail which was absolutely mind blowing, forgot the name. Having said that I Doubt you'll go wrong with the cocktails   For the food, nothing outside the ordinary for a brunch menu. I had the quiche in which the eggy custard was well seasoned. The crust was a little too overdone but not bad all in all! My buddy had the chicken crepes and I wish I had gotten those Bc the shredded chicken and aioli they served the flakey pockets in was just delightful.   Overall the winners in my opinion are the ambience (beautifully decorated and swanky) and the cocktails. The bar is pristine and the bartender was fantastic !  The food is good and won't be steered wrong but again nothing that crosses Barriers. If I was a hotel guest I would be more than thrilled to have this at my doorstep !",

The meat was tender,l and the horseradish sauce complimented it perfectly.  The bun was also one of the best parts of the sandwich.  Sometimes places will use cheap bread with a French dip which can cause the sandwich to become soggy or fall apart.  The bread here however was fresh, crisp, and stayed together when dipped in the au jus.  On the side they give you a mound of fries that no one person could finish.  They were also delicious.  I will definitely stop back to try some of the other menu options.",

Given my limited time, I initially thought I wouldn't get a chance to try it; however, when I realized it opens at 6:30am, I knew I had to come in for breakfast before heading to the airport. I'm glad I did because it was one of the best breakfast I've had.  To start Floor 2 is located inside the Fairmont hotel. The place is large, elegant, and modern. Beautiful place.   Since I got there around 6:45am, the breakfast menu was available. I started with some coffee, as well as some scrambled eggs with cheese and bacon, which felt high quality and delicious. Then, I ordered the French toast, which was the star of the show. The slices were huge, the cream and fruit were fresh, and the syrup delicious. Incan honestly say that it's the best I've had.  It is worth mentioning that this place is not cheap. I spent way over my usual budget for breakfast. However, having this type of quality food, service, and ambiance available at 6am rather than airport food was amazing.  I can sincerely recommend this place and look forward forward to returning.",

Started with the Lot 35 creamy Earl Grey, which had a bit of velvety texture to it, smooth and delicious. Less than 10 minutes later comes the food, I ordered both the French toast and baked egg, yes both for myself. The French Toast was amazing, the thickness of the bread allows me to pour all the maple syrup on top without soggying the the center of the bread, so that you can have both the full flavor of syrup and the fluffiness of bread, all in one bite. If the strawberry on the side was fresh, it would add another layer of refreshing tart to it... but today the strawberry on the side was frozen.  My baked egg was perfect! One bite of sunny-side up egg, with the bold flavor of broccoflower (menu says cauliflower, but the bold flavor points to green cauliflower or \"broccoflower\"), cream, fresh tomato sauce and a hint of bacon and ham, it hit the spot, just right.",

The menu is great, albeit I've had better similar dishes in more casual restaurants. I recommend skipping the lobster bisque, but the strip was cooked perfectly and had great presentation.",

The eggs and sausage were meh.  The sausage didn't taste great and it was a basic meal.  For dinner I opted for the Caesar Salad and a piece of Salmon.  The salad was tasteless.  I also found the wines to be on the expensive side.  The bar service was decent.  The staff was mostly busy entertaining each other than anything else.  Should I return to the Fairmont I'll opt to dine elsewhere in the area.",

The decor is also very modern and clean.  Have you seen their French toast?! Each slice is an inch thick, or even more! It's huge but not too heavy and topped generously with powdered sugar and almonds. They also have a lobster Benedict that is huge and very savory. I'm also a fan of their Thai duck wings -- you get a large amount of wings for the price, so the value is great. Any dessert you get here is delicious and they can make tweaks here and there if you ask.   The bar area is really cool and has a great view. Most of the seats and tables also have really good city views and tons of natural light. Cool spot!",

Our server very confidently claimed that he could feed our entire group of six, family style, with or without wine pairings. All we needed to do was tell him any allergies we had, things we did or didn't like, and anything we'd seen on the menu that we wanted to try. Once this was over we settled in for a memorable and utterly fantastic journey. We ended up with three cold appetizers, three hot appetizers, and the rotisserie chicken, ribeye, and lobster as our main courses. I haven't had such a fun, perfectly paced meal in years! Furthermore when the bill came, I was surprised to see how little damage had been done considering the experience we'd just had. I will continue to come here and bring my out of town guests. Floor 2 is a place you're guaranteed to be satisfied by.",

I have wanted to try this place for a while and they accepted our reservation request, so it seemed to be working out.  Just as many have already stated, the inside of this place is gorgeous.  Very clean, sleek and modern looking.    We were seated promptly upon arrival and that is the only prompt thing about this experience.  I didn't expect quick service, but when you wait 10-15 minutes to be greeted by a server and then another 10-15 minutes for your drinks and then another 10 minutes to order food, it is a little much.    The food actually came out more expeditiously than expected, I think it took less time than the ordering process.  I started with a french onion soup that was AMAZINGLY delicious and then followed it with a roast pork sandwich.  The pork sandwich was pretty good, but the soup was definitely the star of the show in my opinion.  It should also be noted that the sandwich came with the largest order of fries I have seen in a long time and they were delicious - crispy shoestring style.  It wasn't a bad and it wasn't great.  Maybe I will give it another try someday down the road.",

My friends and I were pleasantly surprised by the inventive flavor combinations of their vegetarian appetizers and cocktails. Which enticed us to come here for brunch. Brunch was so enjoyable from the atmosphere and service to the food, we ended up coming back for brunch again the following month! I recommend the French Toast. I only made reservations on a Saturday at noon because we are a 6-person group and wanted to make sure the restaurant was ready for us. But there were plenty of open seats at the bar and smaller tables for walk-ins when we were there. There are options at various price points and in my opinion it is worth the price paid. Street parking is free near the hotel on Sundays and there's always valet if you can't find nearby metered street parking.",

For the main course, we saw some one get the cast iron ribeye (28oz). Best decision all night. Ask for more of the Au Jus sauce (BORDELAISE). That was incredible with the onion jam. Me and my partner are still talking about how amazing the sauce and the onion jam were with that perfectly cooked meat.  Loved it here, cant wait to come back for dessert. We were way to full.

The potatoes though tasted a bit under done... the broccolini was good! Not enough of it but it was good. Because the Brussels sprouts sounded really good we got them too, surprisingly they were as good for us.... it was very under cooked that it was very bitter. Should've been cooked a bit more... I don't remember the rum based drink that they have. But it as nice and fruity! Oh yes! And there is complimentary bread! That's always good   Environment  The restaurant is inside a hotel on the second floor (ha.. hence the name). Very fancy. Great place for a date or nice and quite. You can see the open kitchen where they bring out the foods. Their bathrooms are outside which are part of the hotel.   Niceness of the staff He was really nice! Patiently waited for us to get our order. He always was nice to recommend a drink for me since they didn't have the one I wanted. Everyone was well and proper  Dollar  I thought it was on the pricey end but for good steak it's reasonable... the steak was 62$ good enough for 2 maybe 3 people. The drink I had was $6.   Yes? Probably, I like the vibe. But then again I am not from Pittsburgh! But this place will be in my directory if anyone asks me about Pittsburg   #WendyWanders",

Among the things I tried were ratatouille, Brussels sprouts, charcuterie and cheese board, flatbread pizza, French fries, and some pita bread. I was very pleased with these foods and must give a thumbs up on most of these items. The portion sizes of these plates were generous so I was able to share them with the people I was with.  This restaurant is pricey since it is located in an upscale hotel so expect to pay above average prices. The restaurant has a full bar and it gets very noisy in here that it is difficult to maintain a conversation. It is very decoratively arranged with both tables near the bar area and some in the main dining room.  I was glad I had the opportunity to dine here. Located on the 2nd floor of the Fairmont hotel in downtown Pittsburgh it is an easy walk to Point State Park or if you are headed to the Clemente Bridge to PNC park. The hotel has their own indoor parking as well.",

    "text": "Came here last night with some friends. We parked over on the blvd of the allies in a parking garage and walked straight through market square. I wasn't sure what parking would be like but I'm glad I opted for $6 instead of the valet parking.  We ordered a few things to share off the menu...the cheese tray, simple green salad, french fries, and a few appetizers. Overall I thought the food was just okay. Maybe the entrees would have been more flavorful? The menu was quite pricey but I expect that downtown in a hotel. I tried two different drinks...the sangria and the cuvee brut champagne. The sangria tasted a bit watered down but man that champagne was tasty!!!  The restaurant/ hotel is in a great location within walking distance to many great places. Not sure I would come back for the food but they do have good happy hour drink specials.",

Both the bar and main dining room are beautiful spaces and were full when we arrived, which added to the excitement. Our server Katie did a great job explaining the menu and making suggestions. We ordered oysters, chickpea fricassee, simple green salad, agnolotti and striploin. The oysters were very fresh and presented beautifully with fresh shaved horseradish and two homemade sauces. The fricassee was the surprising favorite of the evening - so flavorful and a great start to the meal! The agnolotti and striploin were also standouts. For dessert, we had the pleasure of sampling 3 dishes from the kitchen: the pavlova, japanese cheesecake and chocolate tart. Our favorites were the pavlova and cheesecake - both very unique and so yummy! I would absolutely recommend saving room for dessert. Despite it being quite a large meal, we left feeling satisfied but not stuffed. Loved how many of the dishes were vegetable-forward. Hope to come back soon for brunch!",

We thought the decor and bar was incredible and were immediately impressed by the comfortable and elevated style of the dining room. We started with a round of cocktails and everything was delicious and unique - the Lunch With Joe was a major hit with our group. The refreshing taste of the prosecco combined with the smoky rosemary flavor was only complemented by the presentation. We then sampled a variety of the appetizers. Among our favorites were the mushrooms, scallops, squash, and a twist on the Pittsburgh classic pierogi. The chicken dish was mouth-watering and tender. Just when we thought we couldn't eat another bite, they brought our dessert - of course we couldn't turn down trying the white chocolate and berry Pavlova, rice pudding, and chocolate cake. Between the four of us, there wasn't a morsel left. Overall, a top notch dining experience in a place that is far from budget breaking! The menu has fresh, locally sourced food, an amazing hand picked wine selection, and cocktails that will have you coming back for all of your occasions! My new Pittsburgh favorite!",

    "text": "The new ambiance is really impressive and a job well-done.  The wine/cocktail menu is creative and interesting.   The food menu is a good start but needs to grow to accommodate a wider variety of tastes. In addition the food needs to be better described so you have a sense of what you're ordering.  As the restaurant works out their kinks, the obvious food delivery timing problems will work out - things like a 20 minute delay on one entree and a 25 minute delay on a side dish won't happen for too much longer I hope. The food itself was delicious and some of it was hot and perfect and served on time.  I wish the server had been a little more apologetic for the obvious problems. Overall there is hope that we will have another great restaurant on the scene prompting guests to return over and over. For now, as the server suggested, they need to work out their process as they are only a month old. They also need to realize that as the customers, we need to believe they're trying.",

We went around 2 on Saturday afternoon, and were greeted soon as we walked into the hotel, then took the elevator to the second floor.  To our surprise there was a 20 minute wait even though there were several tables open.  So we opted to sit in the bar area. The bartender was fantastic, seeing I was very pregnant she offered to make me a mock-tail. Which was so delicious and refreshing to have someone go out of there way to make my visit nicer. Then we placed our orders and my husband got the Short Rib burger and I got the pasta. We also ordered the french onion soup, and to our surprise it came without the typical melted cheese, but instead had bread stuffed with melted cheese on the side.  The Pasta was homemade and looked like a smaller serving but quickly filled me up.  My husband loved his burger and you could actually see and taste the short rib.   This was a great experience and our bartender made it even better. We can't wait to go back.",

My date liked the octopus.  But as a vegetarian, I was disappointed in my meal of small plates. The brussel sprouts were drowing in salt and lemon (they ended up comping us for them, so maybe I shouldn't complain). The cauliflower had a great texture, but was essentially flavorless. The chickpea fricassee was some chickpeas in a bowl with a thin watery sauce and two slices of bread with tomato. I like bread, so I ate a slice of that, but I could barely choke down the chickpeas.",

    "text": "Super Underwhelming restaurant.  None of us enjoyed our food. Very overpriced . Drinks were fare. Do not order the burger... sea bass, scallops or pork belly . Will not return. The  onion soup was awful. There was no flavor to it whatsoever . Very disappointed. My boyfriends sister in law ordered a burger and fries, and I mean cmon it's not that hard to screw this up but it was Awful .",

    "text": "Solid 4 stars. My wife and I had 5 \"to share\" plates.  My order of preference; Pork Belly (a must have), wild mushrooms, Brussel sprouts with bacon, Sea Bass with calamari and mussels and Octopus. All entrees were very good although the octopus wasn't the most tender I've had. The cocktails are creative and delicious. Nice ambiance and exceptional service. Our tab with tip was ~$150 which felt about right for the quality of the experience.",

    "text": "I had been excited to try this place for a few months but our visit was very underwhelming.  Overall, I would probably give the food 3 stars but our server diminished the experience substantially.  Coming off as a very self-aggrandizing expert, he insisted on continually making recommendations for items we didn't want to order and said he was known for \"picking meals for the diner\" on his own.  Most of his recommendations were for the higher priced menu items.  When I ordered the burger, he recommended the steak which was approximately twice the price.  When we asked if there were dinner specials, he said the only \"special\" was the different serving styles of the various waitstaff.  Our party of 4 tried to humor this strange fellow but by the time our entrees arrived, we were sick of his act.  On another note, the roast chicken and oysters were delicious. All of the other items were decent or unmemorable.  The Brussels sprouts tasted identical to what I make at home.  I'm a good cook but still, you expect something better at a classy place.  For the high price of this restaurant, we expected much better. We dined at Spork the same weekend and every element of that meal blew Fl. 2 out of the water.",

    "text": "I had business colleagues in from San Francisco who were staying at the hotel. The renovation of the restaurant was impressive ; hence, I thought the food and service would have also improved. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Our server started off exceedingly attentive, but then we didn't really see him after the appetizers were served to us. Additionally, I waited 40 minutes for my drink and was told there was only one bartender. That's no excuse ; they should hire another bartender. I hope they correct these problems or they'll fall prey to the same demise that the former restaurant, Habitat, did.",
