The bread is perfect, and compliments what is in the sandwich. Fry lovers will enjoy the crunchy fries in regular, or Cajun style. 10% off student discount as well. A must along with Primanti's if you are visiting the steel city as a sandwich lover",

Peppi's is not for the calorie counter. They do not skimp on toppings either tons of fatty cheese, meats and mayo. With a couple of tomatoes for good measure.   So if you are watching your waste line you may want to stear clear.  I mean you can get a philly cheese steak with 6 oz of meat on it.  This place is worth getting a sandwhich and splitting it with a friend.   My favorite menu option is the cajun fries served with a side of ranch dressing.  Totally worth every calorie.",

All I ever get is the steak with American cheese with onions and mushrooms.  They ask if you want tomatoes mayo and lettuce.  Have no idea why, that stuff should never be on a cheese steak sandwhich.  Anyways, much better than Primanti's for a cheese steak.  primanti's you go to if you want say a steak hoagie (which is not steak but actually one of those rectangular seasoned beef patties on a hoagies roll.  Get that at Primantis with a fried egg, and fries and slaw, and you got a good sammy).  For a cheese steak, this is the only place in Pittsburgh to go.  Peppi's.",

The onion rings are huge and the fries are a mix soggy and crispy.  The hoagie was fresh and the cheese and steak both good. I've had better in California which is why I did not give it a 5 star ranking.  I might have to try Primanti Brothers.  I find it funny they have a #7 Ben Rothlesberger.

The item that was featured in that list was the santucci sub. It's a hot mess Italian sandwich with double meat, double cheese, grilled peppers, mushrooms, and the like. HUGE. I got one and turned it into three meals. They also sell coke products..and that includes barq's red cream soda, which I hardly ever see like, anywhere.   Anyway, the sandwich was a ton of food, as mentioned and all quite tasty. If you eat a lot of sub sandwiches, you may find this place pretty average. I don't actually think that the components stood out for any particular reason but the sandwich as a whole was really good - also I don't eat that many sub sandwiches so I don't have much frame of reference to compare to.  In addition, the staff is so fun! As I was debating ordering a drink to go with my sandwich, we had an argument about coke v pepsi (to which the answer is pepsi, duh) and the guys were joking around the whole time that my friends and I were waiting for our food.   This particular location had a small seating area behind the ordering / prep station but we took our food to go. I'm not sure if all locations have seating area..I didn't actually realize this place was a chain until quite recently.   I don't know about parking in this area. Probably not great since it's downtown. If that deters you, try another location. There are several around and those probably have better parking options.",

The cheese steak was delish & I'm pretty excited that I can get grilled onions without an awkward up charge. A cheese steak, fresh cut fries & a drink comes to around $8-9.. extremely reasonable. I ended up only eating half of the hoagie & enjoyed the rest later in the day.   The staff were chatting & joking with me again as I was leaving.

    "text": "I had some friends rave about Peppi's that drove from Robinson office parks to get a sub at one of the city locations.  I never understood that until just now.  I had my first visit and lunch at Peppi's.  I ordered the #7, since I recall seeing it on TV before...maybe one of Rick Seback's shows.  It was hands down the best sandwich I have ever had.  On top of that, the customer service was excellent and everyone was very polite and upbeat..something that you almost never see in a food establishment.  I am now hooked and plan to do the challenge where you basically check off every sub on the menu.",

The sandwiches rival Uncle Sam's locally. These are not your Subway sandwiches; they are MUCH better. The steak sandwich, chicken, burgers, salads are all good. Recommend for a quick lunch pick up for the office!",

It is REALLY gross. Don't even bother.  They grill the sammich fixins where they grill all the carnage so you might as well be eating a burger.  Of course I realized this AFTER the fact and got a meat mickey from this experience.  You want to gain some weight? This is one of the MANY places in PGH that will help you with that.",

The bread went really well with the cheese steak, it tasted fresh and did a good job of balancing the strong taste of the chesse steak The fries were hot and crispy and they gave generous portions. The staff was very friendly. The wait wasn't bad at all, about 6 minutes, and they don't pre-cook their food so its fresh.",

    "text": "Peppi's 2, Pep Boys 0.  Personal Experience: This was the second Peppi's I ever visited, back in the old days.  I absolutely loved it! It took about 10 mins to make my Roethlisberger, and the whole time, the guy was telling me about the shop, about the sandwich, and asking where I was from and how I heard about it. He was fun and interesting and interested in me. It felt like I had a friend. That's the kind of service which is hard to come by these days.  What's more, the sandwich was spectacular. It always is, but he seemed to make it extra greasy, and he put 2 eggs on there instead of 1 for me even though I only asked for 1. Some of the best service I've had anywhere, actually.  I would come back to this location, or the Strip District one, over all the others. I love it. Best service. Miles better than Primanti's.  And more info:  This place has some of the best subs in Western PA, especially the delicious and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! Yum!  Well, well, well. Long before I was ever officially into food and having friends and local fans of my music pick out where I was supposed to eat in any given town I was visiting, I knew about Peppi's. That was because I was once watching the Steelers on a given Sunday (during their famous Cowher Superbowl Winning Run I think), and I saw a special on this little sandwich place making a Roethlisburger. It seemed like they put everthing imaginable on it \"plus an egg\". The \"plus an egg\" thing intrigued me, so when I finally made it to Pitt, I gave it a try.  Plus an egg indeed! My word! It's actually spicy minced sausage (greasy as hell) with all sorts of goodies on it.... er... \"plus an egg\". It helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you'll find. The Strip District folks asked for a signed CD and gave me a free Roethlisburger in return. The Downtown location gave me a free portion of fries because I had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said I would have to wait. So really, whether you're looking for good service or good sub sandwiches (is that really a choice?), Peppi's is a great selection. I'm sure a lot of their other food is good too, but anyone that names a sandwich after the local hero and my favourite (joint) QB, is going to get my business, and since that sandwich is so delicious, it's the only thing I've ever ordered since I started going there.",
