    "text": "This is a cute little place that is defiantly bicycle themed.  I'm not sure when cyclists became so defiant, but Fuck YOU that's why!  I think everybody can agree that at the very least, they harbor little to no animosity to people riding bikes.  It's cool, good exercise, and most people learn how to do it when they're children.  If you are a driver that is a dick to a cyclist, take a minute to punch yourself right in the junk.  Ok, now that that's settled...this is a pretty cool little bar restaurant in the South Side with pretty decent food, and a solid beer selection.  The bartenders are friendly, and the waitstaff is also pleasant.  They have a mess o vegetarian options, and even I am a fan of their seitan.    This place is always packed during happy hour, which can be cool, but can quickly become overwhelming in such a tiny space where maybe too many people are wearing bike shorts.  I've really enjoyed going here for lunch, and they have a peanut butter and jelly burger that I will highly recommend.   Come to enjoy the casual atmosphere, reminiscent of some laid back coastal town, and the defiance of the MIGHTY CYCLISTS!",

The draft selection is small but decent. I ordered the buffalo seitan wings and when they arrived they tasted burnt. There were blackened around the edges and bottom but I was so hungry I didn't want to complain and probably just be served another somewhat burnt order of seitan. I may come back again but not for awhile.",

    "text": "They had me at burgers.  They had me at cheese fries and perogies.  They lost me with wings.  Wings are my absolute favorite, so perhaps my judgements are harsh.  I just want to be sure any wing lovers going to this place who may be considering the wings are properly informed.    I'm not a vegetarian and do not have many/any vegetarian/vegan friends.  Perhaps it makes me uncultured and naive, but I still had no idea what Seitan meant.  Next to the boneless wing option, I just assumed it had bones but was prepared a particular way.  I dunno.  Anyhow, when I ordered them, the waiter so wonderfully pointed out that they were vegetarian made of some tofu conconction.  Wow, thank you so much waiter for telling me.  I would have been so upset to find tofu on my plate where I expected a pile of juicy saucy wings.  So I went the boneless option.  I don't generally do this - breaded chicken tenders covered in wing sauce ARE NOT the same.  But I wasn't in the mood for a burger.  I was looking for something greasy (I had a bad day.).  So I ordered the bonless wings.    What I got was a chicken breast, cut in to slices with wing sauce.  I don't think it was fried - it was most definitely not breaded.  I was confused.  Wings denote a particular body part of an animal, and while traditional boneless wings are not made from the wing, they at least resemble the general shape and are prepared in a similar way.  Same taste, no icky bone for those queasy stomachs.  Nope, these were just slivers of chicken.   The part of me that tries to eat healthy was a bit happy, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for.    I still like this place, but will keep to the burgers in the future.",

The food is awesome (fried pierogi, hummus, seitan wings, burgers [don't forget the peanut butter], fried pickles), the theme is perfect, drinks are strong--what else do you want?  PBR is always two bucks. Well drinks are around three bucks. You don't get the obnoxious bros and drunk skanks that fall all around the lower blocks of East Carson. Usually filled with 20-something \"bike kids,\" but you'll get everything here from yuppies to families with children (they do have a kids' menu!).  Outdoor seating, back \"dining room\" with a large screen for sports and whatnot, awesome environment. Mini bike corral on the storefront (instead of parking spots). It does get a little overrun by kids on weekend evenings, but it's honestly not that bad.  Overall, I can't say enough good things about this place.",

Before our food arrived, one of the staff snapped a photo of my little nephew in his DirtRag shirt.   She was really sweet, but we joked at the end that we should have told her that she could only use \"50%\" of the photo.  Service was also very slow.",

One of the pieces is a cool custom welded bike art piece by the guys at Thick Bikes, which is a local custom bike maker.  There are pretty cool murals on the ceiling done by a local artist.    On tap are a few \"domestics\" but they also have a few great micro brews.  The menu is biking themed and features sandwiches named after all of the local bike places such as the \"PORC\" pork sandwich and the \"Dirt Rag\" burger.  The \"Dirt Rag\" burger actually comes with peanut butter on it which is what I tried when I was there and I actually really liked it. I should state that I love peanut butter.  I talked to the owner and they said they plan to lead some bike rides that end up at the restaurant and otherwise support biking in Pittsburgh, which is great. I am expecting good things.",

Very good draft selection which always has a couple local micros on tap including East End Brewery. The bottle selection is extensive.  Beer prices here are a bit high, but every night they have a different Micro Brewery on special where you get $2 off drafts and bottles. For example Wednesday night is $2 off Great Lakes and Thursday is a Oskar Blues special.  I've heard great things about the food here, but when I came to check out the OTB I had just finished dinner so I wasn't hungry. But the menu looked great and the food I was seeing being brought out from the kitchen smelled really good too.  The staff is friendly with a really laid back and chill vibe so don't be afraid to strike up some conversation.   I will definitely be back to check out the food sometime. People say this is a hipster bar, but it seemed like a varied mix of people who enjoy a cool establishment. Or maybe I'm a hipster and just haven't admitted it yet. Hope more places like this keep popping up on the Sside.",

The grilled cheese is wonderful on a cold day. It's one of the coolest bars around really. The decor is awesome, it's a great location, the bicycle atmosphere is welcoming, it's located near several great bike trails.

    "text": "OTB is a bar that I really want to like, their menu has interesting items on it(Seitan parm? Burgers with peanut butter?), the atmosphere is cool, and the specials are great(Burgers, tacos, beer, etc)... Why can't this place just keep its stuff together to really make it shine?  I'll start with the positives: The food is good and well priced. On a Monday we went and grabbed two veggie burgers($5/ea): The Bicycle Advocate and the Pedal Pittsburgher. They don't come with fries on a Monday but no big, we split a side since they were only $2. The burgers came dripping in their respective sauces making them hard to eat, but giving us plenty to dip our fries in. The buffalo mozzarella, sauteed spinach, and sriracha ranch all went perfectly with each other. My girlfriend also loved her burger, and while we originally intended on going halfsies, we both agreed we liked the ones we got and stuck with them.  The beer was cheap too, they have $2 PBR pounders all day, and usually another bottle that is either $2(Like Monday's Yuengling) or a few dollars off($3 off East End, $2 off Oskar Blues)  I wish I could stop there on my review, but I have to reiterate what other people on here have said: The service leaves to be desired, as it was quite slow. I understand that this is a dive bar, the kitchen is sure to be small, and the place was by no means slow, but does it really take an hour and a half to make pre-cooked(boca) burgers? Beyond that, in the 2 and a halfish hours we were there, we got checked on(Including getting our check and getting our food) about 5 times.   Another point, good and bad, is that Monday is also trivia night at 9pm(Burgers and trivia on the same night? Awesome!) so we also came out for that. however, in the back portion of the bar, it is almost impossible to hear, so us(and a few other tables) wound up running up to the bar to hear ever question. The trivia is pretty well run, though - they have you take your answers up each time and keep a running total as opposed to taking a half hour or more to tally everyone's up(Brillobox...). The questions were OK, though the music between questions was not.  OTB has a lot of specials that are definitely going to keep me coming back.. To me, slow service at a dive bar is to be expected and nobody was rude, so I can't hold it against them - but it does prevent them from being a Pittsburgh destination(unless you're a bike-fanatic). I will update the review if I have to, to reflect any changes(Maybe on $.25 seitan wing Wednesdays!) in service to hopefully give them a higher rating. In my opinion if you cross this place off your list due to warnings of bad service then you're going to miss out, just come with some good friends and time to kill.  Also - Obviously, biking here is optimal to avoid parking, but depending on the time of day you can avoid the meters that run until 10pm by going a block off Carson to Sarah Street or another side street.",

The bartenders were great and had no problem serving us- plus the crowd in the bar seemed to enjoy it! Beer selection was good, but I ended up drinking PBR which was really cheap (I think $2 a beer).

The manager came over and accused me in a loud, rude voice that I \"ate\" the burger and was now trying to steal $5 from him. WTF? I have never met a more rude manager of a restaurant.

There is an excellent selection of beer and for the quality of beer on tap they are really one of the more inexpensive bars we go to.    The service is excellent.  The bar looks really cool inside.

The onion rings are thick (which I like) but the batter is a bit tough and kind of tasteless. The fried pickles are very good. The fried cheese sticks could be frozen.   My burger was a mixed bag: the meat was great, the lettuce, tomato, and red onion were fresh and crisp. But the bun was cold, a big miss. Had they warmed the bun, it would have been a winner. The fries are good, very crispy on the surface, almost fluffy inside.   They've got lots of good beers, as expected. The service is friendly.   I'll give the burger here another try, and next time, I'll ask the server to request me a warmed bun.",

    "text": "When I lived in the South Side, everything got old. I work in the South Side, and the mediocrity is invasive. Strictly talking bars, I'm tired of poorly made hot wing specials, fried and burnt out menus, wilted salads, and overpriced bottles. Luckily, there are a few gems that continue to shine whether you want to join for lunch, happy hour, or even get rowdy. OTB is certainly one of these gems.  Everything on the menu OTB is A-OK. Some things are better than A-OK. Be sure to check out:  -The PBJ burger. Sounds weird, probably, depending on who you are. But it's pretty alright. -The grilled cheese. I always get the grilled cheese. It comes with tomato soup. Don't let them forget the oyster crackers. You could probably get them to put bacon on the grilled cheese if you ask, but I've never asked. I love the grilled cheese. Oh, and they come with... -Fries. Go for the fries. Always choose the fries option. They put some sort of powdered ranch or something on their fries. I don't even want to eat all of them but I look up and blink a few times and they're always gone. I've gone to OTB on a nearly full stomach just because I passed by and had no self control and needed the fries. Oh man, the fries.  I wasn't too impressed with the tacos or the wraps, but that doesn't mean they weren't good. They came with fries, after all.  The wait staff is friendly and comfortably alternative; the cooks are punctual and happy to present you with good food; the beer list is smaller given the location, but every beer's a winner in my book.",

So many mess ups and attitudes it makes me not want to be around there anymore. Tonight was a whole new thing. My boyfriend and I went in for a late night snack and were greeted with snark. No attention for 15 minutes and then we were able to order. When we ordered our food the bartender asked with? Without any explanation, as if we knew the menu, and then attitude. We were surrounded by attractive women at the bar who held the bartenders attention the entire time we were there. Our food came and he handed it to us the check and then stood there until we paid but never once made sure we were good or our food was ok. I do love this place but apparently only the north park location knows how to treat consumers like people. The bartender tonight needs to be fired. I've given this particular place more than enough shots but I will not be returning.",

Service has always been great, although we've only ever gone here for lunch so I can't speak to the dinner service.  Avocado tacos are awesome and so were the fried pickles with peanut butter (sounds weird, but seriously delicious).  I will warn you though not to go to the one North Park location.    In comparison to the South Side location, the North Park's menu is much more limited, not nearly as good, and the service sucks.  Waitress was incredibly rude the time we went.  We were actually there when they had a gas leak and they kicked everyone out.  I'd just gotten a beer and the waitress still tried to charge me for it as she was telling us to leave (I'd taken two sips).  Never going to the North Park location again.  LOVE the South Side one though!",

I ate the Dirty Rag (a burger with pickle and peanut butter) from their large varieties of burgers and its the fuel you need to recover or to start going.  This place makes me want peanut butter on all my burgers.  The fries have that crispy potato dust flavor you dirt find many places that make them extra good and the drink selection is always fresh with lots of specials.  The environment is very unique and friendly and the bartenders are always on top of things.  I would highly recommend visiting this place and getting bacon wrapped bananas on a burger.

The inside is very cool, bikes and gears and cool paintings plus tvs playing motocross or bike videos!! My only problem was the service Every table was taken in both the bar and upper dinning area, we were in the upper section and waited for a little while before the sever came up. After we got our drinks, we waited for a while to put out order in, and at least another 20 minutes before our food came. The problem was clear. There was one waitress on duty!!! One!!! Even if she was the best waitress in town, which by the way she was not, she could have not taken care of that many tables. Maybe it's a scheduling problem, or maybe call offs, but what ever it is, I will be Leary to return based on that alone.",

    "text": "OTB is always bustling with local foot traffic and bike enthusiasts. My husband and I decided to stop by for dinner and sample what they had to offer. We ordered two East End nitro stouts and started with the fried pickles for an appetizer. Our server asked if we wanted ranch or peanut butter for a dipping sauce.  What? Peanut butter? Disclaimer : Please, don't let this deter you. This peanut butter is the most divine nut butter that I have ever tasted. It is made by Wholey's in the Strip District and they get a fresh batch every day. I don't know if pickles are my favorite vehicle for this legume sauce revelation, but it wasn't bad! They also offer a couple of other menu items that feature the Wholey's peanut butter including a burger.  Tonight I ordered the tandem, a grilled cheese and tomato soup. The grilled cheese left much to be desired. It was very bland and the soup was thick and reminded me more of marinara sauce. However,  I don't believe this is a reflection of everything offered on the menu and I look forward to trying something different next time. My husband ordered a burger with a jalapeno cream cheese sauce and he really enjoyed it. The French fries were tops, perfectly crispy and well seasoned.  Our server was exceptional and the atmosphere is lively. I look forward to another dining experience.",

    "text": "I stopped by last night (Thurs.) at 7pm for a casual dinner date with CM.  OTB was recommended to me by my table mate from brunch at the Zenith, who is the manager at REI and a friend of OTB's owner.  Since I had a City Dining Card and was intrigued by the idea of burgers incorporating peanut butter, I'm a cyclist and found the theme interesting, and the location was somewhat convenient for a Waterfront run, we braved the frigid weather and craziness of the South Side to check it out.  Since our waitress informed us that Thurs. night is quarter seitan wing night, we ordered six wings ($0.25) dressed in buffalo sauce with blue cheese, along with some soft pita pieces ($1) for our appetizer.  Although it bears mentioning that the \"wings\" were more like oblong chunks (see photo), they had a great coating and texture, and the buffalo sauce added a nice zing to them.  Additionally, we each ordered a bowl of soup ($3.99 each): tomato-based vegetable for CM and tomato soup for me.  My tomato soup was nothing too special, but was nice and thick, though I would have preferred if it had been made with milk instead of water (I can always tell).  Because he was feeling a bit under the weather, CM really enjoyed his soup--although I didn't sample it due to concerns about his contagiousness.  For my entree, per the recommendation of my table mate at the Zenith, I ordered the dirt rag delight: A burger topped with Wholey's peanut butter, American cheese, and dill pickle slices ($9.49).  Because I don't eat beef, I went with a chicken patty, and of course, I just had to add bacon ($1 upcharge).  This burger was definitely one of the most unique burgers I've ever eaten, and it didn't disappoint!  The peanut butter had a wonderfully gritty, homemade texture and just the right hint of sweetness, complementing the savoriness of the pickles, cheese, and bacon perfectly.  Despite the copious number of components, the burger didn't fall apart as I was eating it, which is the hallmark of a good quality bun.  Because he was trying to eat on the healthy side due to feeling under the weather, CM went with the roadie panini ($7.99), adding chicken for an upcharge of $3.  Again, I didn't try it due to a desire to avoid contamination, but he enjoyed it, and ended up taking half home.  Both sandwiches came with a generous side of fries, which were coated with a nice, crispy batter with a hint of ranch flavor.  Service was about what I'd expect at a place like OTB: Generally pretty quick, if not super attentive, with slight awkwardnesses at times (e.g., we weren't greeted upon entering, and had to seek out a waitress to ask if we could seat ourselves).  Likewise, the atmosphere was about what I expected: Fairly quiet (for a bar, at least), with a TV playing college basketball and bike themed paraphernalia.  We sat in the back dining room, which only had a few other parties at the time of our visit.  As another reviewer mentioned, this is a non-smoking establishment.  Overall, CM and I were pleased with the quality and quantity of food that we received, especially with the City Dining Card and seitan wing discounts (our total check: $22 + change).  As such, I'd recommend OTB as a casual spot to grab a few drinks and some dinner or late night snacks, regardless of whether you're a cyclist or not.  Just don't forget to check out their daily specials, and take advantage of them accordingly!",

This particular section of the Southside is nice because every few blocks is a watering hole with decent grub and cheap drinks. Two Dark Jack Daniels and a Pedal Pittsburgher cost $21.69. The burger was $9.99 and the sriracha mayo was light with the right amount of heat. The roasted red peppers and raw spinach were just what I needed over a medium semi dry all beef patty. The two drinks were $10.28 each. This location is full of local lore and graffiti, it is a small, dark, and loud sports bar if you ask me. Catch the hockey game on the big screen or be treated to a more private dining experience at one of the tables in the room to the rear up the stairs. My server Becky was attentive and kind.

I was definitely underwhelmed.  We started with drinks, and I ordered the Spiced Cider. It was a spiked apple cider that tasted a lot more apple cider than spiked. The only reason that I knew it contained alcohol was because I became very tired half way through the meal. I also had to order the pierogies as they are one of my favorite comfort foods. These were literally the worst pierogies that I have ever had.... I mean, c'mon, if you want to serve frozen pierogies heated in the microwave in Florida, that's fine because no one will know what you're serving anyway. However, this is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and you should not microwave your frozen pierogies.  I must admit that my burger was pretty tasty. I ordered The Fixie, which is a burger covered with blackberry preserves and the incredible Wholey's peanut butter. However, the fact that the top bun was too thick and the bottom bun was non-existent just frustrated me. It was extremely difficult to eat, and I even ate a portion of it with a fork.  Our waitress was just as frustrating as those microwaved pierogies. She was relatively attentive in the beginning. However, we finished our meals, and a busboy came and picked up our plates. We literally sat for a good 20 minutes as she just served the back portion of the restaurant, ignoring her three tables in the front. I almost lost it when I saw her hanging out with her coworkers and friends and eating behind the bar.   Finally, the other patrons were annoying. Two or three loud guys were randomly chatting about drunken nonsense, such as getting \"lit up because it's light up night.\" I mean... it's 5:30pm on a Friday night... are you seriously that drunk already?  Overall, I was unimpressed and do not have a desire to return. Even though the burger was very tasty, the rest of the food and experience was poor.",

Along the growing Carson Street area, we were happy taking a break here and dining at the tables outside for a little people-watching... which unfortunately also invited a few solicitors to interrupt our dining experience.  DECENT TASTING BURGERS= I liked the various patty options such as Grilled Chicken, Veggie, and Turkey besides the typical Beef. Fiance took The Thick (BBQ Sauce, Cheddar, Bacon, and Onion Rings) and was happy with the harmony of all the ingredients. My 'Heaven on Earth' (Buffalo Mozzarella, Roasted Red Pepper, Sriracha, and Tomato) seemed to be missing... something. Perhaps it's because the Turkey patty was flavorless. The accompanying Fries were just okay.   I GUESS I GET THE BIKE THEME = Mind you--I'm a road cyclist. I only somewhat enjoyed the theme (all Burgers have cycling names and all decor inside matches the theme) But it seemed only that way superficially. Other than that, this felt like a typical, theme-stocked sports bar with the same kind of middle-agers looking to get out.  GLUTEN-FREE / ALLERGIC PYRA SAYS = No gluten free Buns here so their gluten-free option is place your Patty on a bed of \"greens.\" My patty and toppings actually seemed pitifully small against the freakin' huge amount of greens bed it was placed on.",

The menu is ridiculously varied (more on that later) and the pricing was in line with what I'd expect for an SS Bar.  Our servers were super awesome and patient (we were a larger group, 8+) and we asked for split checks.  So why just 3*?  It took a while for the food to come out.  The pace at which it came out was also weird.  Once side of the table was done with their meals by the time the other side of the table was just getting started.  I don't think it was due to slowness as much as it looks like they're a victim of their large menu.  We ordered every category.  Meat.  Salad. Burgers. Apps.  So I can see why it'd be a logistical nightmare to prep all that while also accommodating the 20 other tables worth of orders.  I hear there's trivia night.  So I'll definitely be back to give it a whirl.  The beer was good.  The burger was good.  So maybe if we go as a group of 6 or less, we'll all eat at the same time.",

    "text": "One thing I'm a fan of is good ol' bar food! Throwing it in the fryer, putting it on a bun -- all sounds delicious to me. OTB definitely meets to my standard of bar food and more. All of their items are carefully designed to satisfy the greasy spoon (like myself) while still allowing me to challenge my taste buds with a taste elegance.  My boyfriend and I both ordered the Pittsburgh Burger. Amazing! Not only cooked to perfection, but dressed with just the right toppings and seasonings to turn bar food into a fine(r) dining experience. They both came with a side of potato fries which is always a win. The stand-out item that we both died over was the soft pretzels. I don't know how they made them or what they used to perfect such a mouthwatering menu item, but it was darn good. It reminded me of the breading of a corn dog. Light, soft and oh so yummy. Of course, the bier cheese was a great addition for dipping.  The atmosphere here is really cool. It's definitely much different than the typical South Side bar. You don't encounter too much of the the usual \"doucheness,\" and everybody is there to enjoy themselves. There is lots of interesting artwork and bike memorabilia on the wall which adds to the ambience. I'm not sure what I'd call them theme of the place, but I do know that it is working!  Katie is a great bartender and will make you fabulous drinks. Unfortunately, I'm not much of a vodka drinker anymore and the drinks she made us lasted all night (I guess that's not a bad thing for my wallet). They were delicious, but homeboy is getting old! I can't do these vodka dranks anymore.   Definitely will be returning soon. Decent prices (though drinks can be a little cheaper), great food and not overcrowded like some South Side bars.",

I gave a 3 star review to average out the service and food. 5 stars for the service since it was very friendly and prompt, but the food was average (2 stars) at best. The menu has some great ideas, but the execution is just off. We got two different veggie burgers and it was difficult to tell the difference between them because the flavors were so similar. The flavors were underwhelming and not much different than what you find at prepacked at the grocery store.  Also, one of the veggie patties was cold in the center. (Note to those considering the veggie patty option - the patties appear to be prepackaged frozen patties, so if your looking for a handmade patty (not a boca burger) I wouldn't recommend ordering the veggie patty here.) Perhaps the experience would have been different had we ordered meat?   Great concept, service, and decor, but I wouldn't come back for the food.",

    "text": "After enjoying OTB's North Park location this past summer a family member and I decided to try their South Side location. I admittedly preferred the tranquility of their park location, but in fairness I doubt that I'll ever find True tranquility in the bustling South Side. That's just not in this area's nature!  We visited on a Thursday so very few people were actually in the place. Everyone who was there that night had gathered in the bar area, so once we moved to the back dining area we had an entire section to ourselves. Thankfully the speakers in the back weren't super loud (they could have been a bit quieter though). We got our orders in quickly and our meals were ready before we'd finished our appetizer, so needless to say our service's speed was not an issue that night.  As for the food, I enjoyed it overall. Bicycle Cafe specializes in tasty sandwiches and also delivers enormous amounts of food in large quantities. My main course was their special BLT, which in addition to the normal ingredients has egg, avocado and chipotle mayo on it. I ate that whole thing in addition to my appetizer - pierogies - like a complete glutton. My only complaint about the food was that their pierogies were a little overcooked, but still, they were tasty so I can forgive that.  At the end of the meal two sandwiches (with sides), an appetizer and a beer cost us a whole $25 - not a bad deal, I have to say. If we hadn't ordered the pierogies we still would have had enough food and our meal would have cost under $20, so I will definitely keep these guys in mind as a tasty cheap eats option for the next time I'm in the area!",

I arrived a little after 11 am, so there was a group of people there before my friend and I, but it otherwise wasn't busy, which was nice because it is a small space and I can see it getting loud if crowded. I ordered the \"Sam's Portabella 'Samwich'\" with my choice of a turkey burger. Other choices included beef, chicken, or veggie burger. Instead of buns, your glorious turkey patty will be smothered in between two lovely portabella caps, ideal for the carb and health conscious! I cut it into bite size pieces instead of going at it hand to mouth style and I have to say- it was so good I can't believe it is considered healthy! It came with a side of brocolli, which was nice because I didn't have to specify that I wanted a healthy side, it was just part of the package. The \"samwich\" was $8.99, which is a pretty good cost considering that Chef Tyner and Ross worked on the recipe, ensuring that flavor would not be compromised in the making of a healthy dish. (I read that about the chefs on the secret Healthy Eating Menu). I give this 5 stars! If you're on a restricted diet and you taste this glorious (yet PALEO) dish, you too will be drooling!",

I also like that I can visit this place while biking and not feel awkward about my helmet and other gear.  This is a fun place to meet other outdoor enthuisiasts.",

    "text": "I would give this place another try, as it sort of hovers between 2 and 3 stars for me right now. They do have a diverse menu as other Yelpers have suggested, with creative sandwiches and burgers, salads, and vegetarian options.   We stopped in after a bike ride on the recommendation of a friend. I didnt' get all of the details, but apparently there is a smartphone app in which you log your bike rides and that somehow equates to free beer. I must investigate further!  We started out with the seitan 'wings', which ended up being a bit dry and hard. My guess is they were overcooked (fried). The sauce didn't help soften them up, but at least gave the wings flavor.   I ordered the Thick [Bikes] Burger, which comes with cheddar cheese, onion rings, and BBQ sauce. The bun was toasted nicely and had the burger not been overcooked and dry, it would have been mighty tasty. I ended up having to add ketchup to it to combat the dryness of the meat.   Their french fries were pretty stellar, though! I think they toss them in garlic butter - but the fries were still crunchy. I could have just eaten a basket of fries and been happy.   The service was friendly and our gal was pretty attentive. Although, it would have been nice to have been told what beers were on tap. We sat in the back of the restaurant and couldn't see what was available.",

    "text": "I'm not a biker.  What really excited me about trying this place for the first time wasn't its theme, but that it had seitan wings.  The Wednesday happy hour special was half-off appetizers, so my friends and I ordered two kinds of wings, one with cajun seasoning and the other with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  While the cajun ones were all right, we all preferred the BBQ sauce variety.  I've had better tasting seitan, but that BBQ sauce was good.  Blue cheese and ranch dressing on the side didn't hurt, either.  The wings also come with some celery and carrot sticks, and toasted pita triangles.  As my entree, I had the Urban Velo burger with a vegetarian patty and without bacon.  If you like a spicy burger, this is pretty good.  I also liked that the veggie burger had that char-grilled taste, which not all restaurants do with their meatless patty.  Two of my friends tried the burgers with peanut butter, and were really happy with their decisions.  My nut brown ale was fine, but my friends were raving about their espresso beers.  And everyone was pleased with the $3 price during Happy Hour.  Between the beers, the appetizers and the burgers, we got really full fast.  It got harder to catch our waitress' attention the later we stayed, so we ended up not getting as many drinks as we might have.  If you took advantage of happy hour specials, be sure to check that your bill reflects the specials--our initial bill didn't and we had to ask our waitress.  The place was busy because there was a game on, and she did apologize and correct it, but it's still best to stay on your toes.  Next time, it's you and me, PB burger.  And the bike theme is pretty cool.",

I was a little disappointed because all of their dressings used soybean oil (not Whole30 compliant and usually not paleo either) but they happily gave me some fresh lemons to juice as a dressing stand in.  I chose the Heavenly Mess - your choice of protein on top of sauteed spinach, tomatoes, bell pepper, and zucchini. The zucchini was GREAT and I wish they had been more of it. The burger was over cooked (I requested medium and got medium well edging on well done) but still good. Great char flavor on the outside.  Knocked a star for the doneness of my burger but waitress was friendly and service was great (she happily answered all of my annoying questions about soy/sugar/dairy/gluten.)

The app took a long time to come out but it was very good. The portions were huge! Although for the size of the sliders there could have been more guac.  Our meals came out just a few minutes later. I got the Wheelhouse veggie burger it was amazing. Coated in buffalo sauce with cheese and pico. The fries were seasoned perfectly and exactly the right amount of crispness.  My friends ordered off of the healthy menu and got a blt salad with chicken and a bunless veggie burger. We all enjoyed our meals. We went to the bar after for another beer.  We got whatever the takeover brewery special was, IPAs. It was a bit too hoppy for me but my friend loved hers.  The prices were great as were the selections of food and brews. The place was steady busy the entire 3 hours we were there, too.  The decor of the ladies room was really awesome but overall it felt a bit dingy. The toilet seat was wet when I went in.",

I can't say for certain, but I think it might be the location that keeps away the more rowdy college students. Staff is super polite and genuinely seem to enjoy getting to know their customers.   It does have a dive bar feel, but it's pushing its own \"modern BMX pop punk\" kind of vibe I haven't seen anywhere else.

(Even with GPS, we made an inadvertent trip across the Monongahela and through the Liberty Tunnel.)  We'd originally planned to jump right into the city that evening to check out some stuff, but were cowed by the roads, at least in our exhausted state.    I might be overrating OTB Bicycle Cafe slightly, but it was perfect given our circumstances:  A three-block walk, a laid-back pleasant atmosphere, pretty decent comfort food, and beer.  The menu consists of burgers, a good variety of sandwiches and wraps, salads, and some bar apps.  Most are somewhat more interesting and lean toward more nutritious ingredients than you'd get at a lot of bar and grills.  \"Bicycle Times BLT,\" a pressed sandwich, was pretty tasty eating, but then it's pretty hard to screw up bacon, avocado, and fried egg.  (FWIW, the wife was less happy with her \"Pedal Paddle Panini,\" which she said registered as too dry.)  Big beer list, plus eight or ten rotating taps with a well-balanced selection.    I own a bicycle but don't know a damn thing about bicycle culture, so I'm pretty indifferent to  the bicycle-heavy theme of this place.  But the owners have done a nice job with it:  The colorful front area, with a nice bar, has an airy barn-like feel to it, and the darker back room is a more traditional, narrow barroom area.  We middle-agers felt comfortable in here, where the crowd included young urban singles, families, and even seniors.",

    "text": "Going off of my last review... I still genuinely WANT to love this place... but just find it really hard to do so.  My boyfriend and I were looking for a bite in Southside, and since I had a city dining card for OTB, we decided to stop by. We sat at the bar, like we always do, and my boyfriend ordered a beer. The beer he ordered was literally the only beer that sounded appealing on their entire draft list (which consisted of 8 beers). This is the third time that I have gone and have been completely unimpressed by their selection. I almost always order a beer when going out to eat, especially to a bar, but I was so unamused with their selection that I chose water instead.  We started off with two appetizers - hot pepper cheese sticks and fried pickles. We had a choice between marinara and ranch for our cheese sticks- I asked for ranch. I was given marinara. Not a big deal. What really turned me off was that 4 fried pickles cost $7.... Are you kidding me? Yes, they were good.. but not great... and absolutely positively not worth $7. I found that to be outrageous. The hot pepper cheese sticks weren't very hot at all, but were decent.   My boyfriend ordered the Pittsburgh burger and really liked it. He was completely full after eating the burger and barely touched the fries. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. The chicken was grilled and flavorless. I needed to ask for Frank's red hot to give the wrap some flavor.   Overall, I was really disappointed and honestly do not plan on returning for dinner. I did enjoy their taco night last time I had went, and would consider going back for that... or to check out their healthy menu, which I hear is  quite good.",

We came in last night bc bobby was craving a burger. we live a block away but with so many options around us, we normally don't head here. I'm personally a fan of OTB Boathouse.. drinking a cocktail on the lake is way more fun IMO.  I ordered the pump track wrap--- seasoned chicken  topped with pepper jack cheese, roasted red pepper, black bean corn salsa & cilantro lime ranch wrapped up in a warm pita. I wouldn't say its wrapped.. the pita is thick and its more of a chicken gyro. It was fabulous though. I also ordered a sangria. super small serving size but o well.   bobby ordered the Rachel carson Panini-- Sliced turkey, swiss cheese, homemade coleslaw and  special sauce. he loved it. he also ordered sliders.  our server was adorable and super friendly.",

I really wasn't sure what to expect when she typed in her GPS \"OTB Bicycle Cafe\" but it was one of my favorite spots for sure that we visited while I was in Pittsburgh. Very serene type of atmosphere but also extremely kid-friendly. Lots of outdoor seating. We went on a Sunday which typically tends to be one of their busier days and I really enjoyed seeing the couples, families, and children around in the area strolling around near the water. We waited less than a couple of minutes and immediately ordered our brunch beverages. My mimosa was delish! We also ordered several appetizers to keep it light and all were amazing. I loved this experience and would highly recommend to anyone; singles, couples, kids, etc.",

I ordered the hard tail and my companion had the \"pump track\" pita with ancho chicken.  Instead of french fries we tried the black bean and corn salad.    It took a while to get our meals but the pita made it worth the wait.  The burger was very good as was the black bean and corn salad.  The surprise was the wrap. It was fantastic. It was similar to a gyro except with the ancho flavor. It had pepperjack cheese and roasted peppers as well. The flavors together were awesome.   The pump track pita will be the reason we return!",

Most recently, I got the Thick and my partner got the Wheel Mill.   Both were juicy, flavorful and cooked to perfection.  I love when I can taste the burger and its seasoning, with complimentary condiments that don't overpower.  My partner is extremely critical of food, and still says OTB may be one of the best, laid back, consistent burgers in Pittsburgh.  The fries are also delish, and the ranch is a great consistency.    Highly recommend this south side neighborhood spot!!",

I attended Bicycle Cafe for the first time because I had been invited to a fundraiser featuring an evening of live music.  There were service issues before the music started (I ordered the same draft beer as a friend and was charged a different price), but it was the attitude of the staff towards the musicians that ensures I will not be returning (and why I feel compelled to post).    During the last musician (a local artist named Didi Okobi) the bartenders turned up the jukebox multiple times.  Perhaps the first time was an accident, but they continued to do it during the performance (four times), and laugh and jeer with patrons at the bar when requested to keep the music off until after the set.   I was horrified that a place sponsoring live music would be so disrespectful to someone performing, and the audience, their customers, who were there to listen and enjoy.    I will not be returning to the Bicycle Cafe.  If you are a fan of live music, or basic manners, I encourage you to avoid it as well.  If you are a Pittsburgh musician, I encourage you to refuse to play this venue.",

    "text": "I went here today with my boyfriend for lunch just after noon. The place was nearly empty, just three other tables had people seated at them, only one table was waiting for food. Despite the nearly empty restaurant we waited a half hour for a couple of sandwiches. Although they were good (not great) sandwiches we didn't really enjoy them as we had about four minutes to inhale them before running back to work. All told we were in OTB for about 45 minutes, and only 4 of that was spent eating our lunch.  Another peeve of mine is that if you replace the french fries that come with the sandwich with a salad that's 2 dollars. I saw the salad, it was TINY. I know alot of places do this right now, but OTB bills itself as a place for health conscious active people. Why not make it a choice between the lettuce leaves and grape tomato and fried potatoes at no extra charge? That would have endeared me to the place despite the insanely long wait time.   Honestly, I don't want the fries. I'm on a diet and get up at the crack of dawn to go to the gym so I can stop being fat. I rather have the salad, but you're going to charge me a bunch of extra money to REPLACE the fatty fries on my plate with some salad. fine. at least make ti a great big salad with lots of interesting stuff on it. This goes for all eateries out there, give us the option of a health side... vinegar slaw, steamed veggies, raw veggies, whatever... just not fried taters. Heck, how about a steamed tater at least?!",

Nonetheless, I wish the bartender could expand upon each of the beers that were on tap; she quickly blurted them out, and I felt like I was left behind in the dust.  I didn't have too much of a problem with the service- the bartender that served my friend and I at the bar was friendly and helpful.  Getting our food order, however, was a problem.  We ordered an appetizer and burgers.  We waited almost an hour for our food, and the burgers were delivered just before the appetizer was.  Granted, it was a surprisingly busy weekday night (though it seemed that the back dining area was reserved for a party).  At any rate, I really liked my burger when it finally did arrive, and I enjoyed my beers.  I would probably go again just to give it another chance (and because it's different).",

Okay, so maybe the decor is teetering on the edge of cheesy, but the food is definitely above standard, and the vegetarian options made it an ideal destination in my vegetarian days. I've honestly never had a \"bad\" veggie burger here, the combinations they think of are seriously out of this world delicious. On $5 burger night, it is 100% worth it to head down to the southside and grab 1 or 2. I  mean they're only $5? Basically every night they have some sort of special - taco Tuesdays, seitan wing nights. It's exciting for a vegetarian, because rarely do veg heads get the opportunity to participate in one of the most beloved happy hour traditions in this city...half of wings. I don't eat wings, so I'm more than eager to grab them on special at OTB. In the end, if you're looking for cheap veggie eats at a reasonable price, OTB is your place. I will however warn you, you will NOT be getting any sort of homemade veggie burger. These are either morningstar or Boca burgers simply grilled and topped with a couple crazy accompaniments. Rather unfortunately, on par with other reviews, the service does indeed suck. If you're not a regular, you're basically ignored until the server decides \"Well since they're not going away...\"  That said, I'd still go back. They usually have good music, and fun bike videos that you're certainly not going to see at any other bar.",

They go beyond just having \"bike decor,\" this is a place for enthusiasts to meet.  There were perhaps 8-10 bikes parked outside on a freezing January day, if that says anything!  We started with beer - I asked for anything like a wheat beer, which the server said they did not have on tap.  Then I asked for whatever their lightest brew might be, which she reported was Oskar Blues Dale Pale Ale (I think beer changes seasonally).  When I got the beer, I was disappointed that it was their lightest selection out of at least six drafts.  It was certainly brown in color, not the golden yellow that signifies the beers I prefer.  My boyfriend got the same beer and really enjoyed it - I thought it was okay, but too hoppy for my taste.  Seems like it might be nice if they had a little more variety in their draft selections - anything light for people like me?  Our table was right next to the jukebox, but we were still able to hear each other over the music.  There was a steady flow of individuals choosing rock songs throughout the night, and TVs situated around the room.  The lights were very dim and I did strain a bit to read the menu (apparently I'm old now), but I ended up settling on the Dirt Rag Delight, while my boyfriend got the Thick Chix.  It didn't take long for our food to arrive.  My burger was cooked to a medium-rare as a requested, and the bun was sturdy and held its shape - not the little soggy things you sometimes get.  My burger came with cheese, peanut butter and pickles, which sounded so bizarre I couldn't resist.  Amazingly, the combination really worked for me.  It's a hilarious sensation, getting peanut butter stuck to the roof of your mouth when you eat a burger.  Out of the two burgers I've had in Pittsburgh, it was my favorite, but I'd say it was just \"pretty good\" as opposed to \"great.\"  And I had asked for bacon which did not come on the burger, sadly.  The server reported she had put the order in with bacon and the kitchen just messed up.  I believe her, but it was still a bummer - but the burger was fine without it so I asked her not to bother getting some.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, was less wowed by his chicken sandwich.  It sounded incredibly flavorful - chicken with barbecue sauce, onion rings, bacon - how could that not be a major party in your mouth?  When he and I traded sandwiches, I was really floored...with disappointment.  I kid not, somehow it was bland.  Bland!  I can't figure it out!  I think they might've just needed more of everything - there wasn't a whole lot of \"stuff\" between the buns.  It was supremely underwhelming.  Fortunately the fries were hot, thick, and crispy (but in need of salt).  I had to take some of my burger home, but my boyfriend begrudgingly ate his sandwich, too hungry not to do so.  Two beers and the two sandwiches came to about $24.  Reasonable prices on everything - especially the beer - but it seems like the food, in our case, was hit or miss.  Boyfriend wants to give them another chance, since he liked the atmosphere and he thought it'd be fun to ride our bikes down here sometime.  In spring, presumably.  I'd be okay with that, and I bet if I have been biking a few miles, I'll be so hungry that I won't care if some of the food is good, some is okay, and some is not-so-good.  I'll just need fuel.  And OTB can definitely provide that.",

    "text": "I really enjoy coming here. I've never been here just to drink so I can't say much for the southside weekend night atmosphere. But for dinner I've had a great time. They always seem to have specials going on. Monday night is burger night where any burger is 5 dollars. They also have dollar taco and sloppy joe nights during the week. Pair that up with happy hour specials and $3 Great Lakes and Troegs bottles on certain days.  I went in last night and was able to find a seat despite the back room being reserved for a private party. We started off with the zucchini wrapped in cheese and then baked and served with marinara. It was nice to have something that wasn't fried. The only thing I would say would be for almost $8 to only see 4 bite size wedges I was a little disappointed. I would love to see an extra one on there so each one wasn't about 2 dollars each. I ordered a burger with Sriracha ranch, spinach red peppers and tomatoes. I love this burger and the fries are delicious! They are crispy and so so good! My boyfriend ordered the burger with BBQ sauce and onion rings.  OTB is a great place to get a bite to eat. With all the specials throughout the week there's no reason to not try something simple and delicious before you head to East Carson for a night out.",

    "text": "I'm amending my rating after my latest visit to OTB. It was open mic night, and the bar was hopping, though I wouldn't have called it overly busy by any means...it was only 9 o'clock. The pissed-off bartender didn't exactly make our visit pleasant. He was short with us and seemed entirely unconcerned with providing good service. When my husband went to the bar to ask for a menu he just pointed to the corner where the stack of menus sat, which turned me off right away. He seemed to be the only one actually working the front, so I can excuse SOME of his poor attitude, but not all. The food came and it was ok. We paid, not much of a thank you or have a nice night from the bartender once again. So yeah, we might give this place another chance in the future, but it's not on my must list.",

    "text": "Atmosphere - a bar for bicyclers with bikes hanging all over and arty photographs of Pittsburgh and/or bicycles or both some for sale. On walking in I thought we'd made a mistake on seeing the very small bar with a couple tables then walked up a couple stairs in the back to a room with 10-12 tables. Mid-Sunday afternoon there were a couple beer drinkers and as we left a Triathlon group of 10-15 came for a meeting.  Service - surprisingly excellent for a bar considering we were the only ones eating at the time and brought 2 kids with us. Kids were offered coloring books and a selection of markers. One small topping mistake with a burger was quickly remedied and even the chef/cook apologized in passing which was exceptionally nice.  Food - the menu is fun with wild mixes of toppings (peanut butter bacon burger, burger on a salad) that looked fun to try. The kids' meals (usually 2.99) were actually free (Sunday special) and there are a few typical offerings that come with fries, applesauce or celery/carrots.   Burger 1 - Primanti style with egg, cole slaw, fries - was a strong good. 3 stars  Burger 2 - Veggie (all burgers can be made turkey or veggie) boca-style dipped in hot sauce with hot pepper cheese, bacon (yes!), lettuce, tomatoe, blue cheese dressing on side. Delicious. Bun was soft yet not too squishy.   Onion rings - can choose for .95 extra instead of sides. Delicious beer batter, perfectly cooked real onions inside, generous serving. Could have used a little more salt in batter but forgiven because tasted homemade instead of an oversalted mix.  Pretzel appetizer - yummy, typical baked not fried, served with a yummy cheese that seemed like a real cheese spread made with butter instead of plastic nacho cheese. If so quite surprising.  One surprise is that most of the choices on the menu were not very healthy for what you'd think would be a healthy-eating bicycling crowd. Maybe if you triathlon then you don't need to watch what you're eating. The salads were few and very simple. More thought went into the burgers and the sandwiches. There were a a couple simple vegetarian with cheese paninis and the veg burger options and the seitan wings that we didn't try.  Overall primarily a bar with fun and pretty good sandwiches and burger and a couple salads. I'd return for fabulous happy hours and daily specials. $5 burger night for example. $10 any sandwich and a beer night.",

    "text": "This is a super fun bar for a few reasons. The first reason is the decor is all bike related. The second is the ahmaaazing food. And the third is their selection of weird beers. A lot of bars in the southside are a bit typical and boring and I never like the people who go, but this just not the case here!   I have been here a few times, and went back again last night for a little Mother's Day snack. We had two orders of the seitan wings with bbq+ranch and buffalo+bleu. Both come with celery, carrots and soft pita. Perfect amount for sharing (or hoarding). We also shared the spinach dip. It came with more pita and was surprisingly a bit spicy.   Although by this time I was a bit full, I decided to get the veggie burger with fries. I couldn't really tell if the burger was homemade but I also don't know if I cared because it hit the spot. A very traditional burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese and pickles. It was big and a bit hard to fit in my mouth but it all worked out in the end. The fries were my absolute favorite though. Such a crunchy, salty, fried delight. I could not stop eating them.   Definitely returning for more!!",

Any time I step into a place and they are playing \"Umi Says\" by Mos Def, I feel like I am HOME! Singing, \"Umi said shine your light on the world. Shine your light for the world to see...\" The vibe is very cool and hipster. We sat in the back upper level and it was a bit smoky from the grill, but tolerable. It smelled like I was at a cookout. I hard a hard time figuring out what I wanted. But I love trying out different beers, and they have a nice variety of interesting beers. I had the Crimson Hibiscus that was recommended by the waitress.   My friend had the Soup of the Day, Spicy Chicken Noodle and Tortilla and Grilled Cheese. She did not complain, and it looked good. I finally decided on the 650 Bean Cakes. Ok so at first bite, I was a little taken back by the flavor. It was a little bit charred. But just on the edge of one of the bean cakes. It came with guac, sour cream, and pico de gallo. Once I incorporated that in to the mix, it worked and I enjoyed it. But then I just got tired of eating it. I don't think I will order that again. However, I kept seeing all of these HUGE burgers passing me by, so I am definitely going to give the spot another try, and order one of the burgers.  *still singing* \"I aint no perfect man. I'm trying to do the best, that I can with what it is I have.\"",

Also, the waitress didn't know they had seitan so I had to really push her to ask about it to get it.   The second time we ate there was a Vegan \"McRib\" on made of seitan. Totally NOT health food but really, for a non-vegan spot, it was good. Saucey, on a bun...and pretty decent texturally.   We sat at the bar and the bartender was a nice fella. We may have had 1 drink or something. Don't order the salad, bagged mixed greens are just not that good anywhere, or here.   Try it out! Definitely a cool spot to dip in for a snack and a beer - and now Vegans can enjoy it too. I'd call ahead to see if there is a vegan option on the menu before you go if that's why you're going, just in case.",

    "text": "I've always been a big fan of this place from day one! I decided to stop in after a day of ridding and it was burger night so of corse I had to pick up THE THICK! It was happy hour so two bucks off the draft list I picked up the blockhouse pumpkin. It was awesome and the pumpkin was very mild not over powering for a seasonal style. The burger was fantastic I love the Black and Tan rings on it! One thing that I can say that I don't like that is misleading is \"the bmx\" burger because it says \"mac and cheese\" and there's not mac and cheese on it. Next the server only came over after I was finished with my food to ask how is everything. Over all I'll definitely be returning but I think a few things need fixed.",

The burger had winter spinach, fresh buffalo mozzarella, tomato and some AMAZING roasted red peppers. The burger itself was a frozen veg patty, but the siracha mayo, alone with the cooked veggies, really balanced out the dryness of the burger. The patty was also grilled, which added a nice crunchy element to the dish. The fries were  battered and seasoned perfectly. I will definitely eat here again because I'm dying to try their seitan wings. I've heard that they are pretty good. I'm glad that they have a decent amount of vegetarian options.",

    "text": "Problem is moreso with Postmates, but if OTB is going to use Postmates you should have an accurate menu on their site.  Was trying to get some grilled cheese and tomato soup because that's an obvious pairing and OTB has great grilled cheese, so I was thrilled when I saw The Tandem on the menu, and I quote \"A traditional grilled cheese sandwich pressed between  Breadworks Sour Dough and served with a cup of our  homemade tomato soup. What a pair!\" so I ordered two of those for myself and my partner.  When it arrived there was no soup, just the sandwich and coleslaw.   The grilled cheese and coleslaw were great, but I absolutely would not have ordered if I knew the tomato soup didn't come with it. I ended up placing a separate order from Ten Penny for soup because somehow they were the only restaurant in the city with deliverable tomato soup last night. Looking at the menu on OTB's site now I only see the tandem as a kid's item, and it doesn't come with soup, and it costs less than the menu item on Postmates, which is not listed as a kid's item.  What's the point of partnering with Postmates if the menu isn't accurate and you get charged for items you don't get? Attached images are from Postmates showing the discrepancy.",

You can dress up a Morningstar veggie patty, but it still has that distinct taste. If you know anything about veggie burgers, you will know that's not necessarily a good thing. You know who else sells Morningstar patties? Burger King. Despite all of the fixings, I felt like I was eating a $10 Burger King burger.  If you make your own bean cakes, why can't you make your own patties? Or find a better frozen patty?",

I am happy to report that there are at least 7 vegetarian options at OTB Bicycle Cafe.  I had the seitan wings,  little wheat protein nuggets  crunchy on the outside and soft and juicy on the inside they were covered in Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce. They were excellent and my meat eating boyfriend agreed that they were super tasty.   I wasn't a fan of the hummus. The hummas was sweet like a cloying",

For the BLT, you can have fries, the house salad, or a corn bean salad. I believe there is an upcharge for the salad, which is $1. You can also get onion rings for an upcharge.   When you walk in, it is kind of confusing because the bar is in front and the restaurant area is in the back but there is no sign telling you to choose your own seat to make sure you guys don't awkwardly stand there...which is what we did while we tried to figure it out.   Overall service was good and our waitress was very friendly. I definitely recommend coming here with a group of friends because it's a fun restaurant environment.",

    "text": "Went here with my girlfriend after walking to the Zenith Tea Garden and realizing it was closed for a private party.  The atmosphere inside of the bar is much better than most of the places found in the Southside. When you don't belong to the popped collar crowd of bar hoppers it's often hard to find a bar you can relax inside of in that area of Pittsburgh.  OTB has some great \"bar food\" that is also healthy, most of the sandwiches and salads had the option of substituting seitan with chicken which is very appealing to vegetarians and health minded bar goers. I had the Rail Trail Wrap which was chicken, lettuce, carrots, and provolone cheese inside of a pita. The chicken was tossed in a perfect amount of Buffalo sauce (so many places put way too much to the point where all you can taste is the sauce) and the pita was warm, fluffy, and chewy. I ordered onion rings but the chef mistakenly made french fries. I'm a pretty \"live and let live\" guy so I let it go but the waitress offered to make a batch for free. I declined; fries are slightly healthier than onion rings, and it wasn't a big deal. The fact that she caught the mistake and offered to correct it was all I needed to remain happy.  My girlfriend got tomato soup and a mozzarella, red pepper, and tomato panini. I am not a fan of tomato soup but I tried a spoonful and thought it was really good. It didn't taste canned and you could see small amounts of the tomato which leaves me to believe that it was homemade; needless to say, it was delicious, as was the sandwich she had. OTB is a great little bar that isn't just for bike enthusiasts. But at the end of a bike ride it'd be great to grab a beer there and eat a healthy lunch while watching one of their two big plasma screens.  I have a review of a second experience here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Featinginpittsburgh.com%2F2010%2F09%2F20%2Fsetting-the-bar-food-higher%2F&s=224f7988ca7a8645a2a7e993c83535f6e29f49776a117bd56b7f395613559325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eatinginpittsburgh.com/2...</a>",

It was really hard to navigate thru due to the name not telling you what the food was and the SUPER long description for the name.  Then somewhere in that paragraph you get a description of the item.  Also, if you have kids I wouldn't recomend bringing them here or if you're hungover.  This is a dive bar and reeks of alcohol.  If you're hungover your stomach will be churning from memories of those shots you took the night before.  Check out the weekly specials where you can get those scrumptions burgers for $5!  Additionally, they  have vegan/vegetarian options.  My girlfriend wasn't a huge fan of the vegan burger she ordered but is willing to try another option on the menu again.",

    "text": "Please yelpers stop with the references to PBR and hipsters when you review this place. I really don't care if a guy wants to wear skinny jeans cover himself in tattoos and grow a beard to his toes, to each their own. Not every bicycle lover is a \"hipster\" bicycle lovers were around long before that term existed.  I have tried this place twice, first time I have to say it was fine, service was decent and the food just ok. Nothing amazing on the menu but enough to satisfy, I wish there were more vegetarian options that included more than portabella mushrooms as their main ingredient but oh well.  The beer is ok some local craft beers but its 5$ for most of them there are a few 3$ options, that price is ok but there beer glasses are medium not large.  Like I said my first visit was fine, but the second one was a different story all I can chalk it up is that they have more business now and from a management standpoint are disorganized and not keeping up with demand.  Which is sad because this could be a super cool little joint, here's what is standing in the way.  1. Splurge for a beer or drink menu so we know wtf we are ordering, the scribbles on the back of the waitresses pad doesn't count.  2. Hire at least one more food server, who is not a bartender and one more cook for the kitchen. We got there on a Saturday just shy of 2 hrs past opening hour (12pm) Placed an order for two sandwiches, we never saw our sandwiches. Yet people all around us even some who sat down after got their food and left in that time. I can only attribute that to two options 1, the cook forgot our order, or 2 our waitress forgot to place it. Either way get on top of your staff or get rid of them if they cannot keep up on a busy lunch hour, lunch should never take 1 hour + to serve.   3. If your service sucks try a sincere sorry instead of a bunch of superficial ones. Throughout our wait our waitress kept muttering sorry, but offered no solution except they were very busy today...... a place trying to keep business will offer compensation such as free food or at least free drinks. This place did neither all they did was say sorry we are busy, yea so are lots places they don't make you wait an hour for a sandwich an offer no help. I told my friend I thought we should do the right thing and pay for our beers, then the bartender shouted rudely \"I can't take your tab here your waitress has it.\" Thanks add insult to injury, then I was left awkwardly standing in the way of the bar because the place is so tiny there was no place else to stand while we waited for the waitress.... who last chance never offered us our beers for free. That should have been a given with that kind of crap service.   So I was forced to go eat in a chain restaurant with my friend on a Saturday, sad times. Don't think I will be sharing this place with friends any longer, I think its building up the reputation for bad service that Double wide has.",

I hear they have a good menu with vegetarian options but the kitchen was closed when I went.  The guy working the bar was pretty nice and chatted with us and some other patrons about the show that was on TV and other such things. It was nice and quiet.

Our waiter looked like a Flock of Seagulls wannabe and had the personality of a doorknob.  We asked for beer suggestions and were a bit snubbed.  It's not like this place offered fancy martinis, so I knew the waiter could offer at least one beer from their draft selection.    The crowd was a bit unique, but seemed to be having a fun time.  There was a live band the night I was there, so had I stayed longer, I may have enjoyed the night a bit more.    It is hard to not judge a place based on one person, but this place gave me no choice.  I will not be making a return trip to this bar.  Ever.",

For my meal I went with the Wheelmill burger which sounded different than any burger I have ever had.  After the burger is done cooking they dip the whole thing in buffalo sauce.  The burger is then topped with jalapeno cream cheese, bacon, and pico de gallo.  The flavors of the burger were incredible.  The buffalo sauce and jalapeno cream cheese were an amazing combination, and the pico was a great touch to cool things down.  The meat definitely fresh and ground daily.  I ate this burger so fast because of how good it tasted.  My only complaint was the burger was cooked more to a medium well or medium, rather than medium rare.  However, this was not a huge issue because of the great flavors of the toppings and the fresh beef.",

They have bike racks outside and seating, but it was super humid, so we opted for some AC. The decor is fun and bicycle themed.  All 3 of us had burgers, 2 of us had the Wheel Mill (get it, it's so good!!!) and the other had the BMX. My husband was only disappointed in the BMX because he thought it had mac n cheese on it because it said \"Bacon Mac eXperiment\", but he didn't read the rest of the description. It's their play on a \"Big Mac\". Either way, once he got over that, he loved it too. The fries were delicious too.  The service was also excellent. Our waitress was super attentive and also offered to refill all of our camelbacks with ice water.  My only complaint is that I ate too much and felt extremely uncomfortable on my bike ride home. Haha. I would definitely come back here again!",

Their food is super fresh; you can tell that nothing comes out of a freezer. Also, the flavors are so good. I'm definitely not an \"American food\" restaurant type person (as you can probably see from my reviews lol) but I would go out of my way to get a burger or wrap from this place.   This time, I got the Rail Trail wrap to-go and it was very good! The buffalo sauce adds a nice kick...I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if the chicken would've been fried and not grilled. (But maybe they offer that as an option! I didn't ask.) I subbed the fries for onion rings...soooo good. Do yourself a favor and always get the onion rings as your side. Also, the spinach dip (which I failed to snag a photo of because I was too busy eating) is a MUST. The dip has just the right amount of both spinach and artichoke, and it's served with pita bread triangles.  See you next time I visit Pittsburgh, OTB!",

The service is great and everyone who works here is really nice and friendly. I usually get The Cog Salad with ranch which is just a cute name for a Cobb salad. Cobb salads are my favorite type of salad and I haven't found a place that does them better than OTB. I've also had the Punk Bike Pickles (fried pickles), also delicious. I've had a few of the burgers too and I've never been disappointed. The seitan wings are definitely worth a try, especially on their wing night. They have a \"healthy eating menu\" with paleo, keto, etc. options, as well. I tried the portobello mushroom sandwich when I was keto and it was surprisingly good!   Lastly, I don't know much about beer/cider but I always manage to find one I like here. I've tried several new ones here both on tap and in bottles/cans.   This is a great south side spot. I could probably eat here everyday",

Both turned out to be True!   I am a bit of a beer snob and was very impressed with their draft list. It included a handful of local breweries, which I was pleased to see.  The healthier options food menu happened to be $2 off during this time so I decided to make the better-for-me choice and order from there. My friend did as well and we were both pleasantly surprised with how good our meals were. As two people who happen to be trying to make healthier eating choices, it was SO nice to be able to eat at a restaurant and not feel guilty about what we were eating or have to struggle with calculating calories or figuring out how things were made. Plus, it was delicious. She ordered the chicken tacos and I had a Moroccan chicken wrap. Satisfying and delicious!   We sat outside because we had the dogs (who were very much welcomed!), but the inside decor was cool and unique. I saw families and couples dining inside, so it is both a bar and restaurant.   Service was great. Prompt, friendly, and helpful in addressing any questions we had about the menu or needs or extra sauce ;)  I look forward to returning here again!",

It also lacked flavor and I had to add my side salad dressing to it. The side salad was large, simple and the Mediterranean dressing was delicious.   I'd come back to try other things on the paleo menu, but not the lettuce wraps.",

The service was not great, our waitress was covering a lot of tables and she clearly was stretched pretty thin. I had \"The Wheel Mill\" burger which was excellent, honestly one of the best burgers I've had in Pittsburgh. The homemade jalapeno cream cheese on it was fantastic. Their fries were very good too as was their ranch dressing. When we got our check, the appetizer we had was 1/2 off which was a nice surprise (happy hour?).",

OTB happens to have a dedicated Paleo-friendly menu, which usually translates to Whole30 compliant food if you make the necessary modifications. I got a chicken sandwich and my boyfriend got chicken \"pizza\". The chicken was prepared well, but I ended up dousing mine in as much olive oil and salt as I could get on it without going overboard because there wasn't a lot of flavor and zero fat to satiate. It was so \"meh\". The chicken pizza was just okay. Honestly I could probably have overlooked this if the service wasn't so lackluster on top of it.",

I definitely remember the people being ultra friendly and the tap list being excellent.  And if a place can serve up good beer and accommodate our group of kids with many tastes all while smiling we will always remember them.    She Said: We were looking for a place for lunch after getting into town, and we needed a place with good beer and beyond-salad vegan options. OTB hit that sweet spot! He and I shared a burger and onion rings, and I'll let him speak to that. The teens each had variations on the burger (one standard, one vegan, and one daily special with popcorn shrimp on it), and they were all quite pleased with their meals. In fact, the youngest was raving about his meal through the night. I snuck a couple of french fries off their plates, and I was impressed with them. Crispy on the outside, and creamy on the inside with good flavor. The beer selection was good, and it was nice to have some local brewery options. (Hat tip to Hitchhiker Brewing--the brewer there does good work.) Our waitress was attentive and nice, the vibe was cool, and we definitely recommend the place.  Potty Points: 2 out of 5. It is what it is. It's not a place where I'll linger in the bathroom, and the ladies' room toilet was oddly low, but it serves its purpose.",

OTB is a dive bar with a super fun local bicycle theme.  Everything on the menu is related to bikes in some way, and all of the burgers are named after Pittsburgh cycling institutions/events and teach you something about them as well.  My go to order at OTB is an appetizer of fried pickles and The Bicycle Advocate burger.  The bicycle advocate is a burger topped with American cheese, fries, coleslaw, bacon, and a fried egg....sooo tasty! If you are a vegetarian, this place also seems to have a lot of vegetarian options available as well.  OTB also has a lot of beers on tap and in the can to try.  They usually have one or two beer specials that you can find out about if you ask!  I highly recommend OTB for a great dinner and a drink!",

The bicycle theme seemed novel, and frankly, I'd never seen a bicycle bar in any other city.  I had very little idea what to expect. Would it be a bunch of hipsters and messengers sitting around drinking PBR in a can? Would I feel out of place because I'm not really part of that culture? It turns out that this is just a really chill bar, with a bicycle theme, and great place to hang out.  The tap list ranges from PBR (and $1 a pint, to boot) to Great Lakes to Bells and a number of other good options. The menu features better-than-typically bar food, and everything is bicycle-theme. I ordered the \"rail trail wrap\" and my girlfriend had the \"tandem\". The menu is vegetarian friendly, which was a big deal for some of the people in my group.   I wish my city had a place like this. Don't take it for granted, Pittsburgh!",

Regardless, I appreciate that they offer twists on the usual bar food.  (...And not just by doing something \"wild and crazy\" that tastes like crap just as a marketing stunt.)

For lunch my biggest complaint is usually the time it takes to eat there, and it's a little overpriced.  It doesn't look like there is a lunch menu, so $9 for a lunch burger is a little steep.  If you want a side salad instead of fries (they do have good fries) it's $2 more, which is also a little expensive since there isn't anything special about the side salad.  Their soda also tastes a little grimy and flat usually, could probably clean the heads more often.   The beer selection looks great, but I don't partake really during lunch.",

The Beach Cruiser was a delicious concoction with pineapple and BBQ. So amazing and literally the only thing I would order.

While, admittedly my heart does belong to another when it comes to Tuesday night Taco party, I'm always willing to try another taco.   We had a rather large diverse group show up for the taco party and I ordered 3 soft tacos. One beef and two chicken. The shells were rather large, but dry and almost stale. The toppings were also dry and honestly didn't fill a third of the shell. Normally I would have let this go, except that they're one of the pricier options for Taco Tuesday at $1.00 a piece.  In all not terrible either way, but important updates none the less.",

I've had their famous peanut butter burger and honestly, I wanted more peanut butter!  I've seen pictures of gooey burgers and that's what I wanted.  Perhaps it was an off-night in the kitchen.  Their appetizers are great and their fries are awesome.  Barring the one time with the PB, I don't think you can go wrong with a meal and a drink here.  I also had the opportunity to sit at the bar during happy hour last night.  I don't mind sitting alone and scribbling away in a notebook or on a cocktail napkin if the mood strikes (I know, I'm a cliche).  Definitely get here early for a seat if you want to enjoy happy hour ($2 off drafts, 1/2 off appetizers).  The bartenders were friendly with the regulars but left me alone.  The girl who was there early on was more pleasant to me than the gentleman who relieved her, though.  It wasn't off-putting, so no strikes for that.  I'm teetering between 3 and 4 stars because it's an \"a-ok\" kind of place.  I'll go with 4 because over-all, I have few complaints and I like it well enough to keep coming back!",

    "text": "I'm not a hipster, I own two bikes, but I'm hardly a cyclist, and I don't like PBR...but I do generally like OTB.  I love the overall atmosphere of OTB. The over-the-top cycling theme could've easily crossed the line into the cheesy theme bar territory, but it's nicely executed, and after about two steps into the place, you'll see why OTB seems to have staked their claim as the cycling community's primary hangout. Did you get a nail in your tire from riding through one of Carson Street's many construction zones? No worries...you can pick up a new tube at the bar while enjoying any number of good craft brews on tab or in bottles, then get your ride back up-and-running out front with the other regulars who might even help you out. It caters to the cycling community in every way, and I think it's great that a place like OTB exists in the Southside. Of course, we have other bike shops in the area, so I'll focus on the other stuff.  Service isn't great, but it's good enough. I always seem to have \"someone new\" waiting on me at the tables, but my meals usually come out fine. The bartenders are okay, as well. Sometimes it seems like service is a little slow, though. Also, while they OTB has a decent selection of bottled beer, the inventory always seems to be out when I get there... or it runs out while I'm there. Order two or three of any bottle, and there's a chance that you won't be able to order a fourth (you know...for those of us who can walk to the bar from our house...since we'd never have four drinks if we drove, right? Right? Never mind). The same goes for drafts. \"Beer today, gone tomorrow...\" might as well be one of their mottos.  The food is average, with some items turning out pretty decent, while others hit the jump fine, but rarely stick the landing. The seitan wings are often overcooked and tough, which is a downer because even though I'm not a vegetarian, I do enjoy some seitan wings from time to time. The sandwiches are all pretty decent, but there's really not much more to elaborate on because...well...there's nothing to truly rave about or hate on the menu. Therefore, if you're a cyclist looking to socialize with similar people, and you don't mind an average meal to fuel your next ride, it's the perfect place for you. For the rest of us, it's just a decent place to stop in for a quick meal and a decent beer.",

Also, attempting to show my support towards the biking community, I brought up the fact that I was a member of a local organization BikePgh, which he did not believe - unfortunately I did not have my membership card readily available. Upon requesting for our checks he was very blunt and had no desire to request our reviews on our meal or service.  On the other hand, the food was excellent and will attempt to make it back to OTB for the food - hopefully we will not have to interact with such unpleasant staff again.",

Plus, reading the menu so many things sounded delicious that I was having trouble making my selection.   But that's where the good news ends.    The service was so slow.  We could never find our waitress and when she came to the back area where we had a table, it was hard to flag her down.   She didn't check on the table very often and really just came to the table to deliver drinks, take our order and bring our food.  As a result, we didn't even order more drinks.  At the end of the meal, we actually had to flag down another server and ask her to get our waitress.   I ordered the appetizer black bean cakes as my meal with a side of guac, sour cream and pico de gallo.  The cakes were good but they just weren't great. The guacamole was terrible.  There was no way it was homemade.    It was thin like ketchup rather than chunky and filled with tomatoes, cilantro, onions and jalapeno.   I also sampled a friend's fries.  They were good but a little too salty and could have been a little crisper.  I think their menu options are great but they need to improve the execution and quality of the cooking.   All in all, not a great experience but I still love the idea of this place and from what I hear they really support the cycling community and it's a great meet up or post-ride spot for cycling groups.",

They even let you ask to have their yummy blackberry preserve added to the Banana Seat if you want a neat Fixie/Banana Seat hybrid.  But if you're not in the mood for a burger, my friend really enjoys the Bicycle Times BLT. It packs a lot of flavor with the egg and avocado combination.

Everyone laughing, having a good time.  Not a good thing when you come to battle royale in trivia.  Makes it hard to hear the questions being asked.  I think to make it more interesting, they should make you were earmuffs, just to up the difficulty.  Service wise they are amazing.  We sat down at the table to meet our friends and we didn't even have to get comfortable before a waitress was in front of us with menus and asking what we would like to drink.  When our drinks came back to the table I had a question about the menu and she was on point with the answer.  My decision was made.  Being that I just ate before coming here, I only opted for an appetizer.  I selected the fried pickles with a peanut butter dipping sauce.  It took a few minutes for it to be prepared.  Which was truly surprising to me.  Why?  Well let me tell you why.  When my pickles showed up, they looked...\"normal.\"  I tried the peanut butter dipping sauce first to see how I would like it, it wasn't for me, so I asked for ranch instead.  I then proceeded to pick up my pickles with extra care, you know, they looked fresh out of the grease.  I didn't want to burn myself.  But that was a lie.  They were freezing cold in the middle...and crispy on the outside.  I mean how do you even do that?  Deep fry something and it still comes out partially frozen.  I thought I was imagining things until my friends confirmed it for me that they were indeed still cold.  When the waitress came back I informed her of this and said that I wasn't going to eat these.  Within moments the cook had another set of pickles in the fryer and this time they came out perfect.  So perfect I burnt the roof of my mouth because the anticipation was killing me.  I will give this place another chance, but probably during the early evening to try other items on the menu.  And maybe when it's not so crowded just yet.",

I ordered the Dirt Rag ($6) and a side of fries ($1). As a peanut butter fan, I loved the Dirt Rag!! I was a bit skeptical before ordering, but the sweet crunchy texture of the peanut butter won me over; the burger probably would have been even better if they added a few more pickles to offset the peanut butter. I also tried a bite of the fried pickle spears with ranch, but was not impressed, would skip this appetizer.  General consensus in our group was that the burgers are delicious but slightly overpriced, even with the discount for burgers night. The staff got off to a slow start in seating our large group but was friendly and attentive through the night. Bonus points for not adding gratuity even though we had a large group.

We both got The Thick Burger. She got the fries and I got the beer battered onion rings. The burger was fantastic.  Real beef patty, not frozen, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, bacon, topped with onion rings on a brioche bun. Hot and juicy,great flavor. Both the fries and onion rings were great,fries were seasoned. Will definitely be back.",

Depending on what I've eaten that day I either get it with a beef burger or with a chicken breast and no bun. Both ways taste great! The burger comes with pico, hot sauce, bacon and homemade jalapeno cream cheese. I am never let down by how good the sandwiches are!",

You have to ask for it special,  but it has some great low carb options which is great since it's so hard to find places to go out without feeling like a pain to the waiter and kitchen with changes and substitutions.   Went here with a friend and had a fabulous  bunless burger and salad which was well made and delicious and even better was that it was affordable.   This will definitely be in our low carb restaurant rotation!",

But waiters  not very friendly Or attentive.. Waiter stops by for original drinks.. take order ..give food and give check and nothing more  Felt like a bunch of hip People wanting to be cool cause they ride bikes but lacks True genuineness  .... update now years later I originally gave them two stars and my above review... The place has chilled out some and staff has changed and the new people working there are much more chill and down-to-earth",

I had heard so much about the burgers that I was really tempted to get one... but trying to be on the good side (and knowing I was heading to the gym later and didn't want to be slugging it on the elliptical) I went with a better for you option....  The Major Taylor Cycling Salad sounded right up my Ahi loving alley!  I love my ahi tuna and still always get surprised to see it at non seafood type places (although I feel like it's becoming more common at all sorts of places).  My friend also ordered the ahi tuna.  Must not stock up on it, or it's not ordered a lot, because the waitress came back and said there was only one left.  Yikes!  My friend went with another options (isn't she so nice!) and I got the salad still.    Now here's the thing... I eat a lot of salads.  I've had fantastic, un-boring salads, totally boring salads and just so so salads.  You CAN make a salad exciting.  This salad teetered on boring.  It wasn't bad, ahi tuna was okay.  Top that off with a smattering of carrots and a little less spring mix than I would have liked and there it is.    So, knowing they're known for their burgers I will go back when I want to be bad.  BUT I think if they're a stellar place the salad will also be amazing.  So, watch for me, I'll be back and I'm going to be SO bad!",

I love seitan wings but a few times I've gotten them they've been too soggy or too crunchy (overcooked) but most of the time, perfect.  Their service is good (not sure why some complain about that in the North Hills location) seeing that both places have the same owner.   Too bad their bathrooms are too small to have a changing table. Now that we're three we still like to go out and take our (quiet) little one with us. She loves hanging out and seeing new faces.",

She ignored repeated requests for a glass -- I understand and acknowledge that it's a very unconventional request -- despite the fact that I flailed my hands right in front of her and begged her assistance.   I have to admit, though, that eventually she began to comprehend my gesticulation and verbal utterances and handed me a glass with an audible sigh.  I fear though that she falls into a category that Billy Eichner defined: tattoos are her personality.   I wish her well in her future career as a high school guidance counselor.

I believe it's the owner who works during lunches but i'm not sure. Either way, he never greats you with a \"hello\", or a simple \"Welcome to OTB\" usually it's \"what do you need?\". As someone in the industry i consider myself very lax when it comes to service because i know people have \"off\" days but every single time he has waited on me i've felt kind of offended and as if I am disrupting his day even when it's mostly take out orders. It's to the point where I would just rather order from the numerous other places in the South Side then deal with someone who is rude.",

I went in there hoping to see the CYCLING world championships on the tvs to have a beer and watch a race? Baseball....all over the place. I don't think I have EVER seen anything cycling being watched in there.   It has more of a normal bro jock feel than any cycling bar which I have been in. So, basically, it's a sports bar that doesn't show any cycling but a bunch of bike stuff is hanging all over it.  What the heck? Maybe you should change the name of the place to something else? Just ONE screen should have cycling on it at least, at LEAST.  Several national cycling events are on youtube and tv? Are they on at this bar? No. Football is. Locals I talk to about this are as frustrated by this as I am.  Aside from that? The food is great and there are many options to be had. The staff are nice and friendly. The clientele? Weird and diverse. Great beers are there and you can get them to go.",
