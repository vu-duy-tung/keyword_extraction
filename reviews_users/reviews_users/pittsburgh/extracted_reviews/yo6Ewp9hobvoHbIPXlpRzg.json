Truth be told, Ruggeri's is actually my favorite place now in Squirrel Hill for a sandwich.  But since I'm off work all week, I figured I could stop there on another day.  I was in the mood for a good sandwich though and I thought I'd try \"Reuben's Sister Rachel\".  A Rachel is basically corned beef on deli rye with kraut, swiss, and Russian dressing.  My sandwich was a good, nuthin' fancy, basic, solid fare.    Bagel Factory is okay in my book and I've got to admit theirs are w-a-y better than Bruegger's!  But the carbs, the carbs!",

Unfortunately, the visit left me wishing I had just went back to Einstein's.   When we approached the counter we weren't really greeted...the girl just waited for us to say something. I got the bacon egg and cheese on sesame, husband got a BLT on white. We waited what seemed like a long while in bagel-sandwich-time before we got our plates. My husband said the bread on his sandwich was quite underwhelming. My entire sandwich had basically no taste at all. The bagel was dry and had a burny taste. The egg, cheddar, and even the bacon had absolutely on flavor at all. I thought a bacon egg and cheese sandwich was one of those things that's pretty hard to ruin, and the Bagel Factory managed to do so. I was pretty disappointed and eded up heading to Paddy Cake Bakery for a nice glazed donut to restore the moisture in my mouth.",

When you get to the counter, you tell them what you want, and they give you a check, which you take to the register.  You get drinks at the register and pay, while the person who took your order makes your food and then brings it out to you.  Service is always good.  I've been in here many times for breakfast, for lunch, and five minutes before they close, and five to ten minutes is pretty typical; longer than that is very atypical, in my experience.  If they have a lot of take-out orders, the place can be very busy without many people sitting down.  That said, the bagels are outstanding, as is the rest of the food; they serve full breakfast fare and sandwiches; it's a full deli.  The food here is wonderful, and it's a place I take out of town visitors to and would do so again.  There's also a Ben & Jerry's ice cream in the same space; they hire only disadvantages/at-risk kids, and it works out pretty darn well.",

I thought maybe it was a fluke and stopped in again today.  I pulled the Irish walkout after waiting for more than five minutes without even ordering.

This is not based on a one-off experience, either - I go here probably once or twice a week every week, because it's close to my apartment and they have ***green tea ginger ale** (which is the coolest thing ever and I've never seen it anywhere else... ever).  When I say bad service, I mean that every employee here (with the exception of the long-haired lady behind the counter, who is pretty cool) appears to hate their job. They're surly, dismissive, scowly, or just ignore you when you're trying to place an order. I've spent ten minutes waiting to order at the counter while a guy was lounging only a couple of feet away. Got his attention, he said \"oh, yeah, wait a second\" and continued lounging. Super awkward.  The bagels are pretty good and come in wide variety, though. They also have a coffee machine that does a lot of specialty drinks. If they improve the dismal, horrible service I'd love to come here more often.",

    "text": "Bagels!!!!  Delicious Bagels!!  The Bagel Factory is one of my favorite nom-related establishments in my neighborhood.  We don't get bagels from there often (we have to walk a whoooole block and a half to get there....we're lazy) but I suspect as summer approaches and warm weather inspires me to walk around the neighborhood, it'll happen.    Their bagels are so delightful.  Fresh, delicious smelling and tasting, and they know how to properly season an everything bagel.  Those bagels should not just be everything, but EVERYWHERE.  I would like my poppy seeds, onion, and sesame seeds on the top AND the bottom of said bagel.  Otherwise one half is amazing and one half is essentially plain.  Bagel Factory understands this.  So I went there for breakfast for the first time about a week ago, and ordered matzah brie, for fun.  I make it myself, but I thought I'd try their version.  So I order it, and the dude behind the counter is like \"and what kind of bagel would you like?\"  and I'm all \"Does not compute....\" and he's like \"it comes with a bagel.\"    ......  Matzah comes with a bagel?  Carbs + carbs = breakfast?  Okay!  So I got an everything bagel with cream cheese, and fried matzah (which had yummy onions in it).  A really weird breakfast, and I was sort of craving like...fruit or something....but all the components were delicious.  Oh and I had a chai tea.  Also tasty.  Hard not to be.  I'd definitely come back here for more brunches, but I think I'd just get a bagel sandwich of some sort, to avoid the carb+carb confusion.  Also, do you know how hard it is to walk past that Ben and Jerry's counter?  Even at like, 10 am on a Sunday?  In winter?  Holy moly.  Too much tastiness in one place.  If the Bagel Factory ever implodes, we will know why.  Ice cream and perfect bagels under one roof may be too much for the structural integrity of the building to handle.",

The Egg or Rye are often out of stock when we go in the afternoon which is can be frustrating.  Bagel Factory is also a nice venue to meet people -- especially for blind meet-ups like interviews.  There are lots of tables, both inside and outside and a parking lot in the rear.  The biggest downside can be the service.  The people are friendly, but they can be under-staffed.

But today, when ordering a dozen bagels, I requested that they be cut since I was taking them to the office to be eaten immediately. They told me that they couldn't do it - it's their policy to only cut bagels if you call ahead. Doesn't help me much since I was already there. I said it was ok, I could wait for them to be cut. They said no, it's the policy. Can't cut bagels. At a bagel shop. I was dumbfounded. At the time, there was nobody in line and maybe 1-2 other people in the shop. There were two employees making food - one actively making a sandwich and one standing next to her. And another working the register. If they were extremely busy at the time I could understand this policy, but given the situation, I would have appreciated them to go the extra mile to provide proper service to a customer. And oh, not cutting bagels... At a bagel store... Very strange policy.",

    "text": "This review is from two years ago, but I think that it is relevant, being that it involves the same owner, and Bagel Factory has been there forever. It has never sat well with me that I did not write this review back then, but when cleaning out my email boxes, I came across this gem, and am sharing with you...  I purchased a Groupon for Bagel Factory since I often frequented the establishment. I mostly visited the location on Ellsworth, but also went to the one on Forbes. My biggest complaint at the time would have been the inconsistency. Sometimes I was so pleased with my bagel sandwiches, and other items, not so much. Sometimes they listened and got my to go orders right, but often they didn't.   I was able to leave a PRIVATE review about my Groupon and took the opportunity to let the establishment know about my frustration and dissatisfaction with my recent trip that I used the Groupon for, what had gone wrong that specific time, and my remarks on the establishment in general. It is frustrating to frequently get your order wrong, and I though that I should let them know. I felt that the comments on  the uncleanliness of their establishments was warranted. They are really dirty, with grime everywhere and layers of dust on everything above you. It's gross.   Here is the owner's response to my Groupon review...  \"Same in each store. Your so wrong.\"  That was her response. Not 'I'm sorry that you had a bad experience.' Nothing other than to basically call me a liar. So I responded...  \"So, my husband's egg sandwich didn't come with cheddar cheese after explaining that only mine was to have cheddar? And I didn't receive a tasteless, different type of egg sandwich at the Shadyside location days after ordering and enjoying the same thing at the Squirrel Hill location? Your business's are not dusty and unclean? Either which way, I am not surprised that this is your response to a customer who has one too many times a bad experience at your place of business and whom you have no interest and having return.\"  Her kind response...  \"You are the perfect example of a coupon user.  Impossible to make happy.  Want everything  for nothing. We could never make you happy even if your order was 100%right.  Thanks for supporting local.  You obviously don't care about your community.  Jamie\"  I'm sorry, but is now chastising Groupon users? The same service that she gets paid for and provides?? For the record, they still sell Groupons for The Bagel Factory on a regular basis. People should know how they really feel about them.   My response, \"Actually, I have been frequenting your business since it first opened at it's Ellsworth location for more than a decade, off and on. I have spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars, as I mentioned, some of your items have been great, at times. This is the first coupon I have used at your store. I don't understand your hatred towards coupon users when you are the one offering them in the first place, and I've noticed, continue to do so. Your words are beyond insulting. \"Impossible to make happy\"? The first breakfast sandwich (which I paid for, full price, no coupon)  I stated, was GREAT. I returned to have another one, using my Groupon, which I purchased to SUPPORT the Bagel Factory. Key word being PURCHASED. \"Want everything for nothing\"? Where did I complain about the price? Where did I say that I wanted more than what I asked for? My order should have been 100% right. That's not too much to ask when ordering an egg sandwich, on everything bagel without cheddar cheese. You're welcome for my constant support of  your local business'. And no, you will not continue to have my money, full price or discounted ever again. This has nothing to do with me caring about my community as you are not part of it.  Thank you for your exceptional service, beyond rude response and showing your True colors.\"  And the final response that she gave...  \"You have major issues    More than a kid putting the wrong cheese on a bagel. I feel so bad for you.  Best of luck\"  Clearly she didn't read or understand my original words. A kid did not put the wrong kind of cheese on a bagel. I STRESSED to the gentleman making the breakfast bagels that one was to have cheddar and the other NOT. The order was to go, and we got home, we discovered melted cheddar cheese on both of our egg breakfast bagel sandwiches. He was not able to remove the cheese or eat his sandwich because of it.   As a business owner myself, I would NEVER speak to my customer this way. This is personal. aggressive and so unacceptable.   Since this incident, I have never returned to any of their establishments, and never will. They have lost what was a tolerant customer, that spent a lot of money there. I have three children, and the convenience of their food and casual atmosphere was ideal.   I know that this review is lengthy and I am leaving out additional complaints about this business, but bottom line, I wouldn't recommend it for any reason.",

I mentioned that I needed more time.  After about three seconds she asked, \"you ready yet?\"  I gave my order which was as simple as possible...two plain bagels for here.  She asks,\" Do you want them toasted, sliced, cream cheese?\"  I repeated myself, \"Just two plain bagels for here.\"  She asks in a put out way, \"Do you want them sliced?\"  I said, \"NO.  Just two bagels in a bag so that it's as simple as possible for you.\" Now, the bagels.  The absolute worst.  I would have been way ahead if I took the day old bagels.  These were dry, hard and impervious to mastication. If you are up to a challenge for your dental work and want to be spoken down to by an angry dwarf, then the Bagel Factory experience is for you",

    "text": "I really like bagels.  My favorites are whole wheat bagels (untoasted) with gobs of cream cheese, fresh garden tomatoes, red onions and smoked salmon.    I've had the opportunity to eat at the Bagel Factory in Squirrel Hill many times.    Recently, I had a big catering job, and had to pre-order several dozen bagels for a morning brunch.  I called the day before, and ordered some plain, whole wheat, and a few other varieties.  When I approached the counter at 6am on Saturday for my order, the clerk smiled and gave me four large bags filled with warm bagels.    Everything was ready- all I had to do was pay, and leave.  On my way to my event I grabbed a bagel from the bag and took a bite- it was wonderfully fresh, and tasty.    The dough was soft, and each bite thereafter was equally enjoyable.  My clients also enjoyed the bagels, many commenting on how fresh they were.  Besides selling bagels, The Bagel Factory has breakfast and lunch items.  During the summer you can have breakfast outside, and watch all the people walk by on Forbes Avenue.  If you're still hungry after breakfast or lunch, grab a Ben and Jerry's cone to go!",

    "text": "My first foray into the Pittsburgh Bagel Factory was about a year ago to use one of the Groupons they run periodically.  The prices are reasonable, they accept credit cards, and the bagels are generally quite good.  While I haven't tried the entire menu I can also speak highly of their matzo ball soup and pastrami bagel sandwiches.  Although they have free Wi-Fi for customers, the tables are a little small for a full sized laptop and a couple of books - I usually work elsewhere in the neighborhood.  I only have two minor complaints about the Bagel Factory.  First, they don't have any nutrition information, which makes it a challenge to incorporate into a diet of any kind.  And second, unlike any other business I've encountered that runs Groupons, the Bagel Factory imposes a lifetime cap of three purchases (instead of resetting the cap with each new offer).  I get that Groupon isn't a very good deal for a lot of businesses and I'm happy to pay full price, but this is just annoying.",

What is very disappointing about this place is its interior. I want so badly for them to read this so they can make improvements! It could be something special, with way more business than I currently observe. Its empty, large, dusty, unkempt, out of date (less important). I wanted to enjoy my breakfast while I did school work, but I couldn't because their internet was broken. The customer service was meh. The bagel sandwich with lox and a cup of coffee was over 10 dollars. What disturbed me most was how incredibly dim the place was. The workers were literally in the dark! Also, above them was a terribly dusty ceiling tile frame. Right above where I assume some of the food was made. Yuck! This place has been around for a LONG time. I hope they eventually decide to invest in some updates and bring it up to snuff. It would definitely attract more business that way. This place is a Gordon Ramsey level fixer-upper. And I truly wonder if their front-of-house looks the way it does is it up to code where they do the majority of their food prep? Probably not.",

But if that is what you are craving, this will not fill that void.  I think the best bagel in Pittsburgh is a fair claim to fame, but Pittsburgh has some really bad bagels.  Just a thought.  I ordered a rye bagel with bacon, egg, and cheese ($3.99).  There was a ton of good, thick bacon on the sandwich, and that was AMAZING.  Plenty of cheese and the perfect amount of egg as well.  But the bagel was pretty much flavorless.  Rye bagels should have flavor.  If this place wasn't called the bagel factory, it would be different.  But the bagel was so whatever.  The bagels are also really small for a fresh bagel.  I would definitely come back to the Bagel Factory, but I think they really should work on creating a more memorable bagel.

They also have a nice outdoor seating set up on Forbes- which is not typical on the street.   The layout seems weird because they have not converted what used to be the Ben and Jerry's ice cream on the left side of the store front. It's now just a storage corral for bagel racks and supplies.  So much potential for the location, space, and neighborhood- I would love it if that decided to capitalize on what could be a really cute breakfast eatery!",

The person that waited on us was a little edgy when stating that she had to ring up our order as two separate order. It did not matter to us and hubby apologized for the extra work.  But my sense is that perhaps she was edgy because groupon users gave her a hard time.  When she saw that we were pleasant, she quickly became friendly as well.  So to those who complain about staff, remember that a smile and a thank you nearly always helps get you what you want.  I like their bagels, especially the marble rye ones.  We help them out by calling in our order the day ahead.  Even frozen for months, they are a zillion times better that what is available in Columbus.  Oh and in the past we have got their ruben's which are very good.  Just not appealing at 8AM.",

    "text": "Back in September, we tried a week of 'Buy Fresh/Buy Local,' with a goal of having 75% of our meals for the week locally-sourced. I can't say it was easy or cheap, but it was a great experience that left me with a lot of lasting decisions.  One of those decisions? Buying my bagels freshly-made from the Bagel Factory instead of in a plastic bag from the grocery store.  I like the Squirrel Hill location because it's convenient to my house, and although there is metered street parking in the front, there is also a (pay) parking lot behind the building if you have to go during a busy time of day.   They have a ton of different house-made cream cheeses (the lox and chive ones are my favorites, although they have a variety of plain and sweet-flavored cream cheeses as well). The bagels are stored behind a glass partition so you can see which of their dozen-plus flavors are available when you go in. I'm partial to the cracked wheat and grain bagels, but there are blueberry, garlic, honey oat, plain, and everything bagels (to name just a few). All of them are super-fresh and filling but light.  And best of all - at the Squirrel Hill location, if you go on a Tuesday to pick up your bagels, buy six bagels and get six bagels for free!! Free bagels! You can't argue with that!   The staff is always really friendly and helpful. They helped me learn how to freeze bagels without sacrificing quality (so that I could take advantage of that six-free-bagels deal). And any time there's a sale or a special, they will tell you right away when you go in.  The only negative part of my whole Bagel Factory experience is that the stairs leading from the shop to the parking lot out back are metal, and no matter what shoes I am wearing, I sound like an elephant entering and exiting the building. Sorry, Bagel Factory employees! I wish I didn't sound like a stompasaurus every time I go in!  This shop also has a huge chalkboard menu of sandwiches (although I have  only gone for bagels, so I can't comment on the sandwiches), and they sell fresh bread loaves, cookies, and other baked goods as well.  So, be ready to say goodbye to Thomas' bagels at Giant Eagle. Once you get your fresh breakfast bagels from the Bagel Factory, you won't be able to go back!",

    "text": "The ex-New-Yorker in me woke one morning craving a bagel, so I decided to try this place out. I got a multi-grain bagel toasted with cream cheese  The good: the bagel itself was good! It had a nice soft texture with a crispy exterior. All the staff were friendly, and my order was ready within a few minutes  The bad: This place is huge and dimly lit, making it feel very empty and unwelcoming. Also, the bagel was a little on the pricey side: at $3.20 I would have expected it to be pretty filling, but I could definitely have eaten a second one.  This is a good spot to pick up some bagels, but until they improve the lighting and break out some squishy chairs, I will always get my food to-go. I would also skip their toasting/cream cheese, and do it yourself at home",

I was the only person in here and while I waited over 10 mins for a toasted bagel with cream cheese. I was looking in the case where they have all the tuna salads, cream cheese, etc. I noticed that it was very, disgustingly dirty. I'm in food service and I was highly grossed out.   That being said the everything bagel was delicious but I will probably not be back until they actually clean a bit.

By now I was frustrated and accepted the offer to get my money back. It was funny how he grabbed the sandwich, chip bag and drink and ran to discard them all.  The owner apologized, but no one else did. When I pointed that out, he had a worker insincerely yell \"I'm sorry. Have a nice day,\" as I walked out. Crossing this place off my list.",

There were four people working and two customers, and they really struggled to do basic things like relay the coffee offer to the coffee person and the short-order request to the kitchen. The bagels were fine but nothing special. It was 11 am on a Friday and they were out of smoked salmon, which is a level of bagel-incompetence that I've never before witnessed. The interior is dingy; seating is disorganized and arranged weirdly, with divisions and fences in random places. If a person came in, got six bagels to go, and left, it might rank 3 stars. But for *literally* anything else, including a simple sit-down order like coffee, two eggs, and a bagel, it's poor. Skip it.",

They happened to be today, and i was craving a tuna melt, so i took a chance (even though I'm disappointed about 80% of the time i go there or to the Oakland location). I ordered a tuna melt (\"do you want that toasted?\") and potato latkes to go, and then waited for 15 minutes for my food even though the place was completely empty and i think there were 3 staff members there. When they brought my food out the staff member asked me if I'd wanted latkes, and told me he hadn't made them or charged me for them. I said no and left, noticing how small the bag was. When i checked out my food i saw this $9 tuna melt was the size of a standard sandwich you'd make with grocery store sliced bread, and was literally just cheddar on tuna salad. I didn't specify that i wanted stuff on it (lettuce, tomatoes, mayo) so okay I guess that's on me. I hopped on the bus to go eat my lunch in a nice shady spot in Oakland, and quickly noticed that the bag was leaking some mysterious green juice that got onto my clothes and backpack.  In the end i have only myself to blame-- i know better than to mess with this place.",

Sometimes I eat the French toast bagels cold and plain, but they are wonderful just toasted with butter.  The shop is also really cute and has a nice vibe.

It's a greasy bagel because they make that bacon sizzle so you've been warned if greasy isn't your thing. When it comes to cream cheese, many places that serve bagels only give you a small portion barely enough to spread but not here! They lather it on so thick you have to eat it slice by slice rather than as a bagel sandwich. Some of my friends think it's too much and they like to take some off or just order it with less but I love cream cheese goodness on every bite. Each order is made as you like it so if you don't want it to be cream cheese with a side of bagel like me then simply tell them to go light on the cream cheese.

    "text": "the bagel factory is great! we frequented here many saturday & sunday mornings for brunch. in the nice weather, you can eat outside on forbes ave.   they have great bagels (not NY, but hey, still the best you can get for 8 hours away). they have hands-down the BEST challah french toast. we used to try and split it, but there ended up being a lot of fighting over who was getting more of their share, so now we each get an order. service can be a bit slow when they are busy during brunch hours, but i like a lazy brunch so i don't mind.",

The slow-as-molasses service and often-dirty tables: no biggie, since the bagel I get here comes covered in lox spread and is chewy and boiled to True bagel perfection. So far, once of the best bagels I've had in the 'burgh.",

I cracked a tooth on a bone in the whitefish salad once.  The bagels are good, though, and the cream cheese is fresh.  I like that there are a zillion flavors of bagel.  I'd eat here only if I could get someone else (maybe someone I didn't really like, or whose time I didn't value?) to pick up my food for me.",

    "text": "Simply put, the bagels here are pretty good.  Some seem strangely disproportionate, as in the egg bagels are big, puffy and round, but the veggie bagels seem thin and with a much larger hole in the middle.  But anyway, generally good.  What surprised me today was an order of egg and cheese on a toasted bagel.   The egg seemed reheated from previously being cooked, possibly in a microwave, and the cheese looked like a badly melted Kraft single.  I was expecting them at least to crack a fresh egg on the grill, and get a little good grease on to the bagel - but no luck... this was a huge disappointment.  Will stick to the bagels only from now on.",

    "text": "Bagel Factory, not.  No hot food after 1pm. What are the owners thinking. It is a Monday!  I was on Shady at a Dr, appointment and thought a hot bowl and hod corned beef sandwich would be a nice treat.  The Bagel waiter was so flat and unconcerned. \"Cook's gone\".  \"Nothing hot  except a toasted bagel\" The 75 cents for a half slice of swiss you could read thru made me laugh. How pathetic this place is.   No customer service. No smiles. Oh, the cashier did not want to return my debit card until she had a reciept. I only use my debit card and never had this happen, not even when I travel and pruchase more than a sandwich.  Will NEVER go there again.  Will share this experience on FaceBook.  The ice cream shop was the topper. Expensive to rent comercial space in S.H., but 2 eateries in a room the size of my gameroom.  No wonder it takes 2 incoming source of revenues. Dump. S.H. has really declined since I lived there. Customer Service has, also, my review is a  negative six,  wasnot posted with 1 star..",

    "text": "I went into this place on a Sunday early afternoon thinking that I would be able to grab a couple sandwiches for a picnic and be gone. I was mistaken.  I got into a line that wasn't terribly long, but wasn't moving. After about 10 minutes, someone behind me went up to the counter to see why things were taking so long. As he was walking back, he said to his wife that they had stopped taking orders because they were making other people's food.  The seating area was not terribly busy, but the line for take out was going out the door. I had never heard of a business stopping taking orders before, and was not pleased. After another 10 minutes of waiting in line, during which time multiple people walked out, I was able to give my order. I didn't think the prices were outrageous until I ordered my sandwich, a ham sandwich. I was then asked if I wanted anything else on it other than ham. This puzzled me, as I expected a DELI SANDWICH to come with something other than meat. If I had not specifically said I wanted cheese, or lettuce, or anything else for that matter, I would have paid 6 bucks for 2 slices of bread and a bit of ham. I also ordered an egg salad sandwich for my girlfriend, requesting lettuce and tomato and finished my order and paid.   After then waiting an additional 15 minutes, my name was called and my food was ready. I asked the guy preparing the food if the orders were correct, specifically that there was lettuce and tomato on the egg salad sandwich. He replied that there was nothing on the sandwich except egg salad, but that he could add lettuce and tomato with no problem.   So after waiting for almost 40 minutes, I had my food and proceeded to my picnic, where the food was not terribly impressive. The ham sandwich was bland and the egg salad sandwich was very uninspired, as it seemed that the egg salad was all mayo and no egg.  I do not plan on ever returning to this place. This may be shortsighted of me as they may have had a very slow day, but one bad experience is more than enough for me.",
