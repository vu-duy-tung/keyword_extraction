It's a little heavier, but that matches their toppings. They have a 2 topping 12 incher that is 2 meals for me. It's 8 bucks, not too bad. The sausage is ground and they heap it on, m m m m yummy. They also have some great wings.  EDIT: Well after sitting, waiting an hour and a half for my pie that I ordered via the website, I decided to call. It was great to get a bunch of attitude and hear how I didn't use the website correctly. I've only been ordering that way for months. Somehow it's my fault and did I check my bank account.? Really? The owner got on the phone and offered no help. He just kept saying \"What do you want me to do?\" I want food! He should have offered to take care of the situation instead of beating around the bush. For the owners ignorance and the girl who answered the phones attitude towards a good customer, you get 1 star.  You will never see another dollar of mine.",

Blades were dodged, strikes were thrown, a small amount of blood was shed.   \"FOR DOUGHBOY'S!\" they shouted into the shining frost.  \"FOR YELP!\" I retorted.   The battle stopped.   \"So, Darren. What is this Yelp?\" one of my black-suited peers asked.   \"It's a reviews site and a social networking site.\"  They dropped their swords, looked at each other, and began to listen to me.   \"I just wanted to promote Doughboy's. That's all. I am a warrior for quality. Doughboy's IS quality, right? The more business they get, the longer they'll be around...right?\"  \"Y'know what, D, you have a point.\"  \"Besides, I just wanted to try them...once.\"  \"Well, we'll let you have some once more, but that's it. We can't have the mongrels getting in on this.\"  \"That's fine.\"  \"Ok, next time we're getting it with meatballs. You in?\"  \"Of, of course!\"  And wouldn't you know the pizza would be better the second time around? Everything I said about the pie has been magnified by my return experience, especially by the dunes of ground chuck, egg, bread crumbs, and herbs.   A flaky, ample-of- meat Italian Hoagie was also had along with scorching, plumpish chicken wings.   \"Y'know, man, if you want, you can do this with us regularly. You can hang with us,\" one of them told me casually, belly full.   \"Ahhh. But I must move on. There is more pizza to review, to conquer!.\"  \"You. Are an eater's eater. Darren.\"  With that, they all bowed to me and I to them. Respect had been earned and was mutual.",

I started ordering here just because of the glorious online ordering, and now they deliver to my place at least 3 times a week. The pizza is a little different than the norm.  It's a little thicker, with lots of cheese and heavy toppings.  However, aside from occasionally getting smothered in toppings, I have no complaints about the pizza.  Bonus points for using real bacon. The sandwiches and wings here are also very good.  Nothing particularly stands out, but nothing has ever been bad either. Honestly, my biggest beef is that they're closed on Sunday, AKA National Hangover Day, which is a crime against hungover humanity.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of nights ago to pick up a pizza with my fiance after it was recommended to me by a coworker.  Said coworker explained to me that I could order online and I was impressed with the ease to place an online order.  I ended up ordering a plain 18\" XL inch cheese pizza to go which the website said would be ready for pickup in 30 minutes.  I arrived at the restaurant just after the 30 minutes and was told that it would be another 2 minutes.  It took 5 minutes which gave me some time to look around the place which seemed to be decorated with photos of the owner and his family.  There were a ton of them and they kept me busy for almost the whole time that I was waiting.  I also noticed that while I was waiting a customer came in to return his pizza and get a new one.  While I couldn't hear what was being said I did notice that the bottom looked a little burnt and also heard the end of the conversation where the man was dissatisfied after the owner explained to him \"that is how we do it here\".  After I arrived home with the pizza I eagerly dug into it.  The first thing that I noticed was the more than ample amount of cheese on the pizza which also tasted very good.  It helped to cover up the fact that the sauce was a little less viscous than I would have liked and lacked much flavor.  Finally the crust had an odd chewy texture to it which while I did not dislike it, I did not actively like it either.  Since the pizza was quite large we ended up with some leftovers and I think that I liked the pizza better cold as the crust had a different texture.  The bottom line for me is that I would not line up to head back here in the future but I would be going along with someone else if they wanted to.  My favorite part of the pizza was the cheese and how much was on it, now if they could only get a nicer crust and a thicker sauce.",

Unless you like a lot of parm on your wings, there is a bit too much for our taste....and smell.  Overall though, it's two thumbs up!  I had to add this update.  Yesterday, I ordered a \"small\" Hawaiian calzone for lunch.  Holy Cow!  I wouldn't want to see a large one!  Not complaining by any means, but it will feed a few.  It was as big as the box, about 12\" x 12\" and yes, it was really tasty!  I was definitely able to share with the guys.    One thing about Doughboy's, you don't only get quality, but you get a lot of tasty quality for the money!  :)",

They don't call this place Doughboy's for nothin'. Dare I say too much crust? I might be alone on that one but the crust took so much effort for me to eat (kind of chewy) so I just didn't eat it. It might've been better if it was more moist or had some type of butter/oil.  Everything but the crust was good though! The sauce is sweet and different than others that I've tasted but I can't put my finger on why that is. They put a whole lot of toppings on the pizza so that is definitely a nice value!

    "text": "I'm updating my review of Doughboys because they went above and beyond to make things right after my first review. Ryan reached out and offered a free pie to try to try to get a second chance with me. I told him I'd take him up on it, but never actually did. I emailed a few months ago because I was considering it, but still didn't. Finally, almost a year later, I took him up on it.   The sauce and crust were both great. We ordered a large pepperoni and sausage pizza, and it was much better than the last time we ordered. In my opinion, they weighed it down with too many toppings for my liking, but that's better than paying for toppings and not getting enough, or getting what you paid for. I could have done with a little less sausage, but that's just personal preference.   I think these guys are in the top 3 options for pizza delivery to Brighton Heights, now that I've given them another shot. And it's not that two others beat them out - the other two that I like are just very different. This one is best for people who like thick crusts, heavy toppings, and a really substantial slice. If you're looking for a thin, lighter pizza, this is not your joint. Each preference has their place in the pizza wars. These guys chose to be a thick, deep crust place, and they do it well.   Thanks for encouraging me to give you guys a second try. The customer service alone earned you another star. The only thing standing int he way of perfection for me, is how heavy the toppings were, but don't change a thing. What didn't work for me is likely what  keeps others coming back for more.",

    "text": "The pizza is not good but everything else is delicious. I've had pretty much everything on the menu here and my favorite is the buffalo chicken and the gyros. The food is always hot and fresh but the cheese cake is always frozen. I just wish they were a little bit more humble. There are plenty of good places to eat chicken and I don't have to go here so they should be more appreciative of that. They are sometimes rude when I'm picking up the food. I understand that they're in a rush sometimes but there should be balance and a little bit of patience with the customers.",

When someone mentions that a place has the best pizza around (which seems to occur more times than I can count) I'm game to try it out for myself.  Surprisingly,  for has many pizza slices I have inhaled in my lifetime, I can't recall ever labeling any particular pizza place with the best pizza around.  There was one place in New York City that came close,  but it is out of business due to the retirement of its owner.  Let's just say Doughboy's has great tasting pizza.  Very fresh due to the amount of business it generates .   The shop is full of character, starting  with the seasoned employees, the various walks of life who stop in for their \"regular \" pizza by the slice order.  Take out only.  There is a small picnic table out front ,where you are bound to see a few of the locals enjoying their daily nourishment.",

You really get your money's worth when it comes to toppings.  They don't skimp, which to me is a big deal.  I have never ordered from them and been disappointed.  I worked on Neville Island for a time and I ordered from them when I would go on meal break.  Now that I don't work there I have to drive from the south side of Pittsburgh to pick up the pizza, but believe me there are no places in the south side that I want to order pizza from, other than maybe Benny Fiero's if I would walk down the street for a huge slice.  I have not tried their specialty pizza because it is way out of my price range, so I do not know about those, or the hoagies.",

They sang and danced while I walked in. I was coming in from out of town and they made food even so close to closing no complaints.  The smell was soooo good I had to pullover on a side street and sneak a slice on the way back to the hotel.  I've eaten a lot of food in my life and a lot of pizza, let me tell you I would not hesitate sneaking an extra slice of this pie away from a friend even if it meant he wouldn't get to eat.....that delectable.",

So good and filling. You will not be hungry after eating one. I have probably recommended the juggernaut to all of my friends and some co workers. Everyone that ever took my advise and tried it, loved it. I've tried making a home made one before and it just wasn't the same. I always order take out, but any time I've picked it up, the workers were nice and took care of me fast. Never had any issues here.",

They have some great offerings to choose from at great prices. The slices are HUGE!!! My dad loves their spinach and chicken pizza- I tried it too and it tasted wonderful! The 5-cheese pizza is awesome. Whoever at Doughboy's thought of putting 5 cheeses on a pizza is a genius- praise them. Praise everybody at Doughboy's though; they truly know how to make a spectacular pizza. I'll definitely call again the next time I have a pizza craving. The delivery is fast too! :)",
