Since we were early he was able to tell us about his business and his passion for making great pizza and other pasta dishes. He kept us mesmerized with his story of starting his pizza shop and his passion of making award winning food. Great food and an enjoyable owner. I live in West Newton so it takes awhile to get to Castle Shannon.  I will be back this time on Sunday when his mom makes her  gnocchi. Dan said to me when we're out we're out. So get there early. To bad he is not in Westmoreland county. Love Franco's.",

The owner 's mother took our order and chatted with us about our impressions of the area, having moved from Jersey City.  The owner entertained out 6 year old with his pizza making skills.  We ordered a medium pie, half plain for the boy and half with meatballs.  It was amazing, by far the best pizza we have found in these parts.  Momma brought us a meatball to try to honor our first visit.  My italian wife may have slipped and said that Mama's meatballs are as good as her Nana's.",

The sauce and cheese are flavorful. They use ground pepperoni which is pretty unique. Like I said, you won't be completely disappointed, but at the same time you won't be wowed. It's just ok. Probably nothing I'd go out my way to order again.",

The meatball I ordered to go with the gnocchi was authentic - made with beef, pork and veal!  It's a BYOB and with just a few tables to eat inside.  My friend got the Blue Pig pizza- it was a delightful surprise  - the crust was crispy, not chewy - and had a wonderful flavor!  the toppings were very savory and included pine nuts and spinach.  Don't overlook this modest family run eatery in Castle Shannon - either to order take out, delivery or eat-in.  A bargain with authentic Italian food - I'm planning on coming back to experience more of their menu.",

I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza for take out. $9.99 plus $1.49 for the pepperoni only to find out when I got it home that it had no pepperoni on it. The crust was sooooo SOGGY it tasted like it was soaked in water. I called the next day and spoke to the manager. She told me they use ground pepperoni (NEVER HEARD OF GROUND PEPPERONI ON PIZZA). I told her it had NO FLAVOR and perhaps they should advise customers of the GROUND Pepperoni when ordering and also show that it is ground on their menu. She was not at all apologetic about the terrible pizza I recieved. She did however offer me  a free pizza but I declined. Why suffer again. This is the THIRD pizza joint at this location in the last 10 months and if they keep making pizza like this, They'll be gone soon too.",

Ordered a large pie...1/2 with onion and ground pepperoni, the other with mushroom, onion, and hot pepper rings. The ground pepperoni really made it tasty!!!! It is put on the pie after the sauce but before the cheese so it cooks into the sauce making it taste that much better!!! I thought the quality of toppings was good and the quantity was perfect. The crust was good and just chewy enough.  We also ordered some of Nonna's gnocchi and a couple of meatballs. The meatballs were big and had a ton of flavor, and the gnocchi were killer. No question that either was homemade!! We were walk in customers so we sat at the counter top while we looked over the menu and then waited there for our food to be cooked. It is a small dining room, most of the tables were full and phone orders and pick-ups kept coming in. The owner was the pizza maker and he talked to us while cooking along and so did some of the other employees. Everyone was friendly. I would recommend trying Franco's if you haven't made it here yet!!!",

Their pizza is more expensive than Il Pizzaiolo and in my opinion Il Pizzaiolo is a better pizza.   They have some other specialty pizzas that sound really good, so I think if I were to try them again, it would be for that.",

For you, I will both cross a bridge AND go through a tunnel. For your perfectly-seasoned pizza crust and giant juicy meatballs, I will even sit in traffic on West Liberty Avenue AND Route 51. It is that serious.  This is the cutest pizza shop. Incredible service, and workers/owners who truly care about the business. They put their hearts into this shop and it shows.   The pizza is delicious. The crust is just the tiniest bit salty, and pleasantly garlicky, and the sauce is so well-balanced. I'm picky about my red sauces, but Franco's hits it out of the park with balance. Not too sweet, not too salty, not sour in the least. It's everything a pizza sauce wants to be.  The meatballs are also noteworthy. They're meaty, gigantic, and juicy as can be. And unlike that dish your Baba made for you your entire childhood that you just couldn't replicate at home, Franco's masters the old family meatball recipe as if Granny herself is hard at work in the kitchen six days a week.   They do takeout and delivery, but I recommend going in and sitting down at one of the tables to enjoy your meal. You'll get to chat with the staff, hear their stories, and feel like one of the family.  So cross the bridge. Take the tunnel. Embrace your road rage at that intersection-that-might-actually-be-a-portal-to-Hell on 51. Do whatever it takes to get to Franco's and get yourself a meatball.",

    "text": "Franco's is a decent establishment and it is clear that they take extreme pride in their craft although their product misses the mark a little bit.  The inside is very small and if you dine in you will leave smelling like pizza for the rest of the day.  The prices are a bit more than they should be, clocking in at $14 for a regular large sixteen inch cheese pizza.  They do use really high quality ingredients but it still a bit much for a pie from a little shop like this.  The store is very small and it decorated poorly in the standard dirty pizza shop style.  The menu is printed on a piece of paper from Kinko's.  They use regular pizza boxes and then stamp their logo on them really small on the box, which is pretty funny and kind of ghetto.  I get the impression that no one that runs Franco's really knows what they are doing on the business end.    I was happy to see that they use a conventional brick oven as opposed to a conveyor oven.  Unfortunately, they make their pizza on screens so the dough doesn't get the direct heat that it needs to get fully crispy and cooked.  When the owner is making the pies he takes his time and makes them pretty well.  The one time I came in and there was another guy making pizza and it was noticeably worse than usual and most of the sauce had drooped into the middle because he didn't account for it by putting the majority of the sauce on the outside so it can drift into place naturally while cooking.    The dough: The dough is pretty flavorless.  It has a somewhat typical Pittsburgh taste, a bit on the sweet side and lacking any real signs of fermentation.  The dough is fairly moist, a bit too moist to be using with screens.  Because of the screens the pizzas don't full cook to where they should be and even though the bottoms of the pies are cooked and done the dough right under the sauce is still a bit raw and doughy.  After each pie comes out of the oven they brush the crust with oil and hit it with some herbs not unlike Domino's.  Some people probably have little mini-orgasms over the herb crust but I would much rather have a crust that taste like good crispy crust.  The dough is definitely the weakest link of the pie.  The cheese:  They use Grande cheese (aka the best).  I think it is 100% grande but I can't be totally sure.   The sauce:  Franco's uses Stanislaus tomatoes which are among the best tomatoes you can buy.  The sauce is pretty good but could use work.  The flavor is very herby with a decent bit of garlic.  The sauce is borderline bitter at times but not exactly in a bad way.  It has a bit of spice that I think would be nice if they toned down the herbs.  The consistency is in the middle of the road, not too chunky and not too watery.  I do think they use the old fashioned stingy pizza shop recipe of using crushed tomatoes, tomato paste and than water so save money.  This is probably part of the reason they are overcompensating on the herbs also.  They are using herbs and garlic to disguise the fact that the sauce is probably at least 20% water.  It still isn't a bad sauce by any means and is still better than most in the area.  Like many Pittsburgh pizza shops they tend to go heavy on the cheese and skimpy on the sauce which I dislike.  Also sometimes it seems as though the sauce isn't distributed well across the pizza and you end up with one of those bulls eye dart board looking pies where there are big portions without sauce and big portions with all of the sauce.    This place makes a really excellent marinara sauce for their pastas as well, although there are some things on the menu where they say they are giving you marinara sauce (for example Breadsticks with Marinara) and what they actually give you is just cold pizza sauce (which is terrible for breadsticks).    Overall its still a pretty solid pie.  If they were to ditch the screens and make pizza the old fashioned way it would do them wonders.  Less cheese and more sauce would be nice also.  This place is definitely worth checking out and I imagine people than aren't as picky as I am would love it.",

We were camped out in our RV across the street for a hockey tournament when a nice lady brought 2 pizzas over.  \"We didn't order any.....\".   \"I know but its slow and thought you boys might want some pizzas\".    HELL YEA. free pizza, no mater how bad is 3 star material at least.  Marketing genius. The pizza was A+ so we went across the street (12 pak under arm cause its BYOB) and killed 2 more larges plus left a fat tip for the nice folks. This is my kind of joint. Doesn't look like much from the outside but is a hidden gem.  Why the pizza is the shizz: crisp brick oven style crust that actually has flavor. You will not leave pizza bones on your plate. The secret : these guys use cold filtered water and make fresh dough every day. The ground pepperoni was a nice touch .  Bottom line: do your part to help get this country out of its recession.  Spend your hard earned cash at a mom and pop shop like this.",

The pizza was awesome...but I feel like that has already been established in most of the reviews I have read.  That being said, I would like to put a spotlight on the HOAGIES.   One word:  Unbelievable!  The weight of a whole hoagie, alone, is unbelievable.   I ordered The Godfather which was described as a mobster of a hoagie.  What the menu failed to mention was that The Godfather weighs 7lbs. and you may put your back out trying to lift it to your mouth (small exaggeration on my part...but not that far off).  Every bite was loaded with meatball, sausage, onion, peppers and bread.  Delicious, delicious, delicious, delicious.    Some people may complain about the prices at Franco's, but you get what you pay for.  And what I got was an amazing meal, made with quality ingredients, prepared by the friendliest staff I have ever encountered at a pizza shop.    I'm already looking forward to my next visit...when I will try the Drunken Pig with a side of Don Capo :-)))))",

I ordered delivery which arrived within the time specified,  but the pizza to me was just awful.  The crust was so soggy and the toppings just slid right off...it was a mess. Also, it was so salty I could barely eat it. The hoagie was OK at best, but nothing outstanding. I can honestly say I've had better experiences at Papa John's and Pizza Hut.",

    "text": "Just moved to the area as a bit of a self proclaimed pizza snob originally from NY and used to NY style pizza. So far I have tried the Blue Pig pizza, the Don Porco Pizza and the Don Capo Hoagie, as well as a regular pepperoni pizza, and some meatballs (sub and soufle)   While it's definitely not NY style pizza, it is truly an experience worth having. Santoro's takes on \"interesting\"/gourmet combinations that are measured by a combination of a sum of all ingredients.  The end result is truly awe inspiring eating experience. The Don Porco for example, features Pork Belly on pizza. Not the standard, but if you like pork belly, and you like pizza, it's a cutting edge take on \"pizza fusion\" if you will, and it really works.   My other big take from Santoros is their crust. Typically oil sauce based pizza let's the oil play the feature role in the overall experience of the crust. At Santoros, the oil and crust interact in the exact way you would want them to in that both players have major roles. Even in the regular pepperoni pizza, the crust tastes infused with just enough oil to keep it moist and delicious, while not making you feel like you are eating a \"greasy pizza\".   The meatballs are a nice side addition to give \"pizza night\" a bit of a kick up  Finally, delivery on 2 different orders has been an efficient, on time, reliable and a pleasant experience. Online ordering is simple and user friendly, and delivery drivers are nice people.",

Very fresh and had a great garlic taste.  The pizza was also great.  It is a thinner crust type pizza.  The crust was crispy and had a great flavor.

But that said, my favorite pizza is Santoro's on Willow in Castle Shannon. Daniel, the owner cares so much about the pizza and other Italian favorites he makes. It's as if he feels the weight of carrying on a tradition of making simple superb old country food with high quality ingredients, on his shoulders. Pizza dough in Pittsburgh is generally to chewy. Daniel's is crisp, tasty and golden brown. Give Santoro's a try. You will not be disappointed. P.S. Order your pizza a little well done. The char matters!",

    "text": "I have been here three times. This time instead of dining in, I got it to go.  I also decided to try a meatball after reading the reviews.  The pizza was fantastic! Everyone who had a slice said so (and we eat a lot of pizza which makes us experts.)  The surprise for us was the meatball.  I just got one so we could sample it.  It was delicious, as well as the sauce that it was in.  So much so that next time we may order 6 or so and make a meal out of it. Or we may try one of there meatball menu items.  This part of Castle Shannon reminds me of Mr Rogers'  Neighborhood.  Mr McFeely could walk in at any time. Its part of the charm of the place!   I am looking forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "Three words summarize our experience at Franco's:  Best. Pizza. EVER.  That's a bold statement, I know; believe EVERY word. Danny & family have something incredibly special going on here, and you owe it to yourself to get your catoosh out to Castle Shannon to partake in the passion, hospitality, & culinary perfection that only a TRUE Italian pizzeria can deliver.  I've been all over this green Earth and I've never had pizza like this. I'd put Danny's work up against anyone's, including those I've sampled in the mother country, Italy. Crust? Flaky, light, perfectly textured, and delicious. Danny's technique for doughraising should be patented. Sauce? Perfectly portioned and balanced; marked by notes of both sweetness and spice. Cheese? Ooey-gooey melt-in-your-mouth perfection. Toppings? Highest quality; the hand-ground pepperoni reduces greasiness but adds flavor to each slice. Together, these ingredients and techniques work in concert to finish in a symphony of flavor; in short, the perfect pie.  To top it all off, Danny, his mamma Elvira, and staff couldn't have been more hospitable; they made us feel like we were \"famiglia\". We'll be coming back as many times as they will have us!  Please. Go to Franco's. Make the trip. Bear the traffic. Burn the extra gas. You'll be glad you did.  ***UPDATE***  We visited Franco's again a couple of weeks ago - everything I said above is CONFIRMED. Danny, Nonna, & staff treated us like royalty...like FAMILY. This WILL be our go-to place for Italian cuisine in western PA until the apocalypse or Danny runs out of ingredients, whichever comes first.   I'll say it again:  Best. Pizza. EVER.",
