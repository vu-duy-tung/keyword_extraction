There was a nice ambience - it was quiet but not uncomfortable so. It would be a great place to study, read, or visit with friends.  You should expect to wait a few minutes for your drink, but it is well worth it :-)",

I will definitely be coming back for more of their coffee!",

My wife and I both got lattes and pastries, and everything was good to go.  It looked like we were the only patrons that didn't plan on spending the whole day there, rooted to a chair.  We got the next to last free table.  Almost every \"two-top\" had only one person sitting at it.  I would imagine it's tough to find a seat sometimes.   Recommend!  P.s.

This place soared to the top of my list and I'm so glad my friends were able to accommodate my wish to spend a little time here to enjoy the coffee.   We arrived late afternoon and were able to snag a table in the front area by the side bench. Our group of 4 had a hot chocolate (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VaQhUU3P4Z5A3oYPsEMbkw?select=uVENzI1bJBnaixbrQhwDxg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VaQh...</a>), 2 small lattes (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VaQhUU3P4Z5A3oYPsEMbkw?select=b7sSeMMurott79Bf4hK6mA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VaQh...</a>) and 1 medium latte (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VaQhUU3P4Z5A3oYPsEMbkw?select=UqQ_WNMtHEDrxMpwl6GL6Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/VaQh...</a>) (me).

Carefully poured, the swirled milk and espresso combination was divine. Oh and the biscotti cookie? One of the best biscotti cookies I've ever had. It wasn't too crunchy actually but the raspberries in the cookie really shone throughout which I loved.   The place was filled with other patrons on laptops using wifi so I would imagine this is a great place to get some work done.  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd make a point to come here often. Since I don't, I will just make a stop at Enrico's a must-do whenever I'm in town.",

It was incredibly smooth with a complex flavor. It rolled off my tongue without the thin taste of a poorly roasted bean. As the drink cooled the flavor profile changed but continued to please.

I was surprised when I asked to see the tea list and the barista told me they didn't have much to offer.  Still looked like a good amount to me and I was pleased to see a variety of different offerings some coffee shops don't offer (because, well, they're usually coffee focused!).  I also enjoy that they use loose leaf tea, so you know it's not just coming straight outta a generic box of Twinings.    FREE internet is always a big plus with lots of outlets.

Did I mention that I forgot my water bottle on my ride too?  I was a desperate woman at the end of that one.  So I got home aired myself out and drove myself to Enrico's since a previous yelper mentioned she had the best iced caffe mocha there.  There was easy street parking right out front and I really liked that it was nestled in the middle of a neighborhood and not a loud crowded street.  Tables are large enough for good work space and folks had their laptops out inside enjoying the free wifi while the tables outside were filled with friends.  So why the 3 stars?  Well the iced caffe mocha was a bit subpar.  The syrup was all at the bottom leaving my first couple sips very watery.  Could have been a better mix.  Would I give this another try?  Sure but I definitely will ask for a nice hard shake of my iced caffe mocha before taking a swig.  The coffee place at the Walnut Mall in Shadyside is still my favorite for the iced coffee of the year award.  Try the iced OR blended ghiradelli mocha when you are shopping Shady-style - AWESOME!",

It it sometimes busy and hard to find a table (which is not surprising since it's a great spot), but I like the neighborhood feel and the staff has always been very friendly.  I usually get iced Americanos in the summer and regular coffee or lattes in the cooler weather. All of the drinks I have ever had here have been tasty. I have also had some of the pastries (and maybe a bagel at some point?) and everything has been fresh.  I'm a big lover of coffee shops and this place fits all of my requirements. While I don't live in Highland Park, it's definitely worth an occasional trip.",

My mother got a espresso.  Both drinks were good, but for being one of the top rated places on yelp, I expected more than what I expirenced.   The apple pastry did not seem very fresh, but it was still very good and worth eating.    I guess I was just a little disappointed because I expected so much more than what I got.",

The espresso was a perfect balance of flavor with a smooth finish, the foam was stretched perfectly and expertly poured to form a heart in my mug. My accomplice's Americano was equally well made, not a note of sourness but plenty of body and flavor. I regret that I didn't notice the \"Manual\" bar menu before I ordered, I've been dying to try a pour-over coffee, and I know it would have been delicious.   Pro-Tip: There is no sign for the unisex restroom, which is to the left of the service area, past the bulletin corkboard.",

There's always the same old guys sitting outside and at least one biker grabbing coffee. One of these days we'regoing to buy some of the art they have hanging inside.

    "text": "Pittsburgh's definitely got nothing on Seattle when it comes to a good brew but if you look hard enough you'll find a few diamonds in the rough. Tazza D'Oro is one of them. I wont say THE best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care Tazza D'Oro subscribes to. It brings them millions of miles above Starbucks and (gasp) Crazy Mocha.  I found out about Tazza D'Oro while browsing the blog of an award winning, internationally recognized barista. He conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the US via Google Maps. I clicked on PA and zoomed it, not even expecting to see a marker. Surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for Tazza D'Oro.  Their baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. Once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. They also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and, at least in my case, not done nearly as well as it should be. Their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- Enrico's in the Strip District; what more could you ask for?  I have a longer article on Tazza D'Oro as well as another great coffee shop, Espresso a Mano on my website. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Featinginpittsburgh.com%2F2011%2F02%2F11%2Fcoffee-pittsburgh-part-2%2F&s=1b8a8aa665d1f618a0f771a61975c09c27837929e26dd559a01328dc34cb059a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eatinginpittsburgh.com/2...</a>",

    "text": "I'll preface this by reminding anyone who reads my reviews that 3 stars is a good review for me--it means it's good, but I'm not going to go out of my way for it.    Enrico's Tazza D'oro Cafe is definitely very good--I love the location in Highland Park, and the early morning crowd seemed pretty nice and very eclectic.  We even ran in to a friend while we were there and had a nice chat.    My girlfriend and I ordered lattes which were excellent--the space was overall very nice inside and while the selection of pastries was a bit thin I would say the ones they had looked good.  I do wish they had more outdoor seating, though.  It's tough to make the \"I'm a fan\" list for coffee houses.  I'll try it again and may change my review in the future.    While I\"m on the note of Highland Park, I want to join the chorus of people who are dismayed by the recent hit and run involving the two bikers in Highland Park.  Accidents (no matter how horrible) do happen, and as such I'm not as angry about the actual accident;  but to just drive away and leave people severely injured by the side of the road is pretty wretched behavior.  At this point, i only hope that if you are the person who did this, you will at least dedicate the rest of your life to doing good to balance your to-date lousy behavior.  It's never too late.",

I'm a steamed milk kind of gal.  Starbucks bless them when I am in a rush but i have to order a tripple just to get a hint of my fix, but the coffee here is the right strength to cover my caffeine withdrawals. Lovely atmosphere small but not tiny, outdoor seating if you want it. Their espresso shots are not served in steamed cups.  Take note if you're a hardcore ezzzspresso shooter and you like it piping hot. I am sure if you asked they could probably warm the cup. The baristas are so friendly and laid back and funny. Also the staff members let me use the bathroom after closing one time perfect gentlemen :)   A decent selection of yummy pastries to compliment your coffee awaits from apple turnovers to decadent brownies.  I also like the crowd that comes here, there are younger people, older peopler and everyone inbetween (the 30 somethings and 40 somethings) my age group. It has a neighborhood feel but I can tell people come from surrounding areas, Tazza is a great example of merging the old and new in Pittsburgh while maintaining the character of its home borough.",

It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.  The coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.  In addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.  All that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation.",

I was instantly enamored with the set-up inside and the pleasant nature of the individuals who greeted us behind the counter. The baked goods were absolutely fabulous and we literally would have bought one of everything if we hadn't come to our senses. I ordered a grande cafe mocha and it came with a wonderful rim of whipped cream (I believe the whipped cream was homemade as well.... simply to die for) and a subtle addition of foam art which just shows how considerate the baristas are of their craft. My boyfriend ordered the italian cappuccino and said it tasted just like the drinks he would get in Italy over his 2 week visit with family this past summer. Now if that isn't representative of a solid job in bringing a European Cafe to the States, then I don't know what is!",

The food is a bit expensive -- for the same price I'd rather go to Whole Foods.  I come here on my bike, I come for the coffee.  Cappuccinos, Lattes, and Macchiatos are amazing.  I was also quite surprised how good the regular coffee is which includes one free refill.",

My closest coffee option before was Seattle's Best, so you can imagine how delighted I was when this opened next door to where I have class all day.  The first week they were open I think I went there about 4 times.  The Italian Cappuccino will wire you for a few hours, but is totally amazing.  Their basic coffee pales in comparison to their espressos though, so stick with espresso drinks. I have also had two delicious paninis, which I highly recommend.  Knowledgeable service. Great drinks! yum!",

Given that, I consider it a testament to how absolutely wonderful Tazza D'oro is, because one sip of my friend's mocha and I was in silky, smooth heaven. I ordered the hot chocolate, which was every bit as rich and creamy as a hot chocolate should be.   On to the food - don't come here if you expect a wide selection of bites to pair with your drink. They only had a few options, but from what I could tell, each one was crafted with love, skill, and just the right amount of sugar. I had a fruit tart (berries and strawberries), which was a delightful combination of tangy and sweet. My friend had a very satisfying chocolate croissant - but to be fair, it's difficult to make a chocolate croissant anything but. I was so impressed that I took home an apple puff pastry and vowed to return posthaste.   This is precisely the sort of place in which Elizabeth Bennet would while away a dreary day, were coffee shops accessible in rural, Georgian England. I wouldn't suggest coming with a large group; neither the limited seating nor the ambience is conducive to that.  It's quiet and intimate - ideal to catch up with friends or bury your nose in a book.",

It was the exasperated sigh when I corrected them, I could've fucking done without. Still didn't get an iced skim latte.   Also, when I point to something and use the proper name of it, I feel like it shouldn't be a problem for an individual of average intelligence. I ordered an apple dumpling, pointed to the apple dumpling, and thought I was watching them put it in there, until I turned my head for a second, and got a fucking Danish.

On a visit with my wife, her latte came out far too milky. Probably just a mistake, so we reasoned that this place deserved a second chance. The next time around, we order a pair of cappuccinos, one with vanilla --  Now, before I go any further, I recognize that cappuccinos are typically made without sugar or added flavoring. I have also been to a ton of neighborhood coffee shops, have heard the question \"wet or dry\" a thousand times. Sometimes a \"wet cap\" is really what you're hoping for in a latte. And even when it's not, like most people, I don't snark or complain when someone gives me a cup that isn't quite what I was hoping for. I usually end up liking it anyways. My taste buds aren't that delicate.  Perhaps you can see where I'm going with this story. Vanilla cappuccino. I get it, it's not something that's done. But when someone asks you for something you don't sell, just explain the situation politely. If you feel the need to snark, share knowing glances, or anything along those lines, just stifle it. Trust me, I've seen many professionals perform better with requests far more ridiculous. There's really never any need for snobbery. So I've got to dock Tazza d'Oro a bit. Too bad, because the coffee is pretty good.",

Kinda pricey for what you get.  The coffee was ok - nothing exceptional (I drink it black).  The fruit tart looked great, but it was bland.    The atmosphere was not bad at all.  The staff was very friendly.  They appeared to have free wifi as I saw several people with computers hanging out inside.  The food and drink were just not that great, and were too expensive for what they are.  3 stars.  I'd go back for coffee if I needed a quick caffeine fix and was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way.  I'm sure for some people who like specialty coffee drinks, they probably make 'your drink' just the way you like it - they must, with all the glowing reviews they have on here.  My review is based on black coffee and a pastry.",

Sometimes I bring my laptop here to work and I never feel rushed or like I'm taking up too much space. I love when a coffee shop makes you feel welcome. They have free wifi which is great too.  Try the cardamom latte, it's delicious! Also I've had some of the cake donuts and they're awesome too.  I really like the self-serve water too so I can refill without feeling like I'm bothering the busy employees. Definitely check this place out!",

They have a great selection of hot beverages and always have a variety of baked goods. It is a great place to head on the weekend to get work done, but since it is the place to go - I typically run in to someone I know and end up getting to catch up with people as well! The seating is limited, so with more than 2 people it is a challenge to get space to sit during the busy times.  I also love that they feature local artists. I attended an art show there one evening and it was a lovely community space to celebrate the artist's success!",

We sat in the window corner and enjoyed the sunshine, while looking at pamphlets that were out showcasing Pittsburgh's finest. This place is on the smaller side so there may be times where seating is scarce. It has an extremely awesome hometown feel. It seemed like 75% of the patrons were regulars who knew the staff and the other customers sitting around.   I tried an espresso macchiato and the pumpkin muffin. The muffin was very moist and delicious. The espresso was actually really good. This was a traditional macchiato with no sweetener. Normally I just have these for a jolt and chug it down, but this one was so smoothe. I actually sipped and enjoyed the flavors.   This place is your typical expensive cafe price point, but nothing outrageous. I definitely suggest stopping by, I know I will again.",

I now know why there were only two left. Originally, I had planned to get food but they were sold out of the spinach and egg sandwich, one of three vegetarian options on the menu. I was slightly disappointed because I had come during lunchtime, but that just means I'll have to go back. Other than that, the staff was very friendly.

There is on-street parking and the cafe offers some outdoor seating by the sidewalk. By the time I arrived, my friend had already ordered for herself and suggested the special, Matcha Tea. I have seen this drink offered at several cafes and coffee shops but had not tried it, so I did. She warned me that it tastes like grass and when I tried it, she was not wrong! It wouldn't be \"my cup of tea\", but it was okay. I thought the prices for the drinks were quite high, however,  they may be based on its location and I am not familiar with Highland Park. After our long stay at the cafe, I could not spot an area to place our used mugs. The disposal bin was located behind the counter where the baked goods were and I felt that was not a place where guests should be going.    I would like to try this place again and order something different, maybe even purchase a baked good. It deserves another visit at a later date!",

The locations is pretty, inviting and quiet; Pandora plays in the background - loud enough to enjoy, but not loud enough to drown out your conversation.  And conversation there is! It's a wonderful community where the regulars meet of all ages, talking about their families or getting together on Saturday/Sunday afternoon to catch up. Otherwise you can come in do get some work done, discuss your newest project with your coworkers or just fill out job applications and yelp reviews like I do.   The Service is friendly and pleasant and the coffee is good. Personally, I have been opting for the Tea which is served in a larger pot if you are dining in. Not the highest of high quality, but after all, it's a coffee shop and not Tea [plus my mother spoiled us with Marktfrau back in the day]. When my roommate vouches for coffee, I listen, and Enrico's has been T' approved.   All in all, like the place and love the community and naturally I will continue to make Tazza D'oro my coffee shop destination.",

Every time my iced coffee has an odd (and not pleasant) taste that no amount of sugar/creamer can hide. Likewise with the espresso.  The best part about Tazza is their banana bread. I could eat it by the loaf. I like their snack options, just wish it wasn't so expensive!  Seating is also an issue. It's very hard to find ample seating during peak hours, so be aware of this before you visit. It can also get pretty loud with the outside crowd or if there are people chatting inside.

By the look from the outside, the name and the general mistique, you picture it being a fancy Italian restaurant.  When you go in you realize it has a more homely kind of warm atmosphere.  The food is just pre-made salads that sit in a fridge waiting for pick up.  Oh, there are some sandwhiches made to order as well, but it is not overly fancy.  It seems like just a nice, inviting place to order a quick bite over some coffee.    Ah, so most people are going to chat about the coffee on here, which means I get to be the lone person that steps up to the plate and writes about their tea and bites.  They serve Rishi tea, which is very high quality flavorful tea.  The salads are very nice and very appropriate for a meal on the go.

I got the drip coffee and oatmeal cookie sandwich, and my friend got the featured Rwandan espresso and chocolate chip cookie. The coffee and pastries were great, the atmosphere was definitely my flavor of \"hometown hipster,\" and the guy behind the counter was friendly and quick. This seems like a great place to get work done. There is music playing, but it's soft. Plus, there's WiFi!",

It's perfect if you're looking to do some work or chat with one or two other friends. Due to its small size it's not ideal for big groups. I usually go on Saturday mornings/afternoons and tends to be crowed but I've always been able to find a seat!  I've never had a negative experience with staff here. They are always friendly and helpful!  A big plus for this cafe is that it is reasonably priced. I tend to favor their lattes.   They use Counter Culture coffee here, which I love! I even picked up a bag last time I was there.  Over all this little charming coffee shop is a perfect place a caffeine pick me up.",

    "text": "I stopped by here earlier today with my wife for our morning coffee.  I think that I have been to Tazza D'oro once before but it has been a number of years since then.  What prompted this visit for us was that they were on the Pittsburgh Coffee Passport.  Whenever we arrived the place was pretty full, both inside and out, and my wife and I took the last table.  The inside here consists of a bunch of seating, an area to order your coffee and then some paintings on the wall which are for sale.  From our seats my wife and I were able to watch one of the baristas make both a chemex and a v60.  For both of them we watched him measure out the beans on a scale, fine tune the grinder before finally doing the pour over.  It was nice to see that they care that much about their coffee.  For coffee on this morning my wife and I both ordered the cappuccino.  They also had interesting sounding cardamom lattes and lavender lattes.  After a couple minute wait our drinks were ready and looked pretty.  My cappuccino here ended up tasting quite good and I could tell that the beans were both freshly roasted and ground.  There was the tiniest bit of bitterness which the milk quickly covered for a good tasting drink.  The bottom line for me is that I would come back here again in the future.  I liked my coffee here and would be interested in trying a pour over as well as some of their food on our next visit.",

Their coffee is awesome and the atmosphere inside is great, in my opinion. Sometimes, depending on the clientele that day, it can be too quiet and awkward if you're there to chat with a friend, but even then, I've never been made to feel like we're bothering anyone working near us. They have some really nice art up on the walls which appear to be local and for sale. Highly recommended for a stop for anyone in the area!",

I wanted to use my coffee passport here, but was disappointed that my cappuccino was only 12oz. I'm used to big coffee, but big coffee doesn't equal \"cup of gold\". My entire day changed when I drank this coffee. I was late for work and no one cared. It blocked annoying calls from my phone. This coffee filled my hard, shrunken heart with pure joy.  This place is worth a visit if you are in the Highland Park area or if you need a powerful burst of energy and productivity.   Normally coffee just allows me to tolerate people, but Tazza D'oro gave me a genuine smile of empathy and admiration to everyone in the 2 hours after consuming their cappuccino.",

Lots of regulars.   The coffee is delicious!! There were a number of hand pours and French press selections it was hard to choose. They all sounded amazing. The pastries were drool worthy. My daughter had the salted caramel brownie and the other a scone. Both were devoured in two seconds flat, so there's that. I on the other hand was looking for a bit of vegan protein which I found in the chickpea salad. It was good. Not fantastic, but did what I was looking for. I would try something else next time. The panini seemed to be a hot seller.   Service wasn't fast, but we weren't in a rush.   Definitely a great place to do work or read a book. We sat at the tables out front on a lovely Saturday morning watching dogs walk by and people ride their bikes. Very cute neighborhood. A stop at Highland Park after was a perfect way to spend a morning just outside of downtown Pittsburgh.",

I'm aware, like many reviewers on this site, that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer; but even still, there's no way this is a five star coffee shop. Yes, the coffee is good and if I happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot, I'm sure I'd stop in to get it again.  But the place itself was a turn off, despite the interesting people that it attracts.  Glossy refinished exposed wood beams, fake grape vines over the windows, and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere I can't overlook or sit in.  I think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park, but for me it's going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on - it's just not worth the drive.",

It'd be way cool if they would source their pastries and bread locally. Until then, it is simply a great place to get coffee and espresso, with nice vibes and pleasant service.",

Good food.  The employees are awesome.  The owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood didn't previously have anything like it.  The shop is also all about bicycling as transportation, sponsoring regular group rides around town, and also group walks for those not bicycle-inclined.",

But when I realized that I go out of my way to get coffee somewhere else that is way less convenient, I realized it was time.   I have heard great things about their cappuccinos and lattes and other mixed beverages, but that's not what I generally want. I want black coffee with nothing in it but coffee. You'd think this would be a cafe's specialty. No. The coffee is undrinkable! I actually bought a coffee and had to throw it away before I left the building because it was so awful. I've never tasted anything like it. That was the second chance I'd given the place. The first time I just suffered through it because it was not delicious, but it at least resembled coffee.   I can't speak to their fancy drinks, but if you want straight up coffee, this is not the place for you.",

    "text": "The epitome of 4 stars: Excellent without being perfect. Tucked away in the middle of a charming old residential neighbourhood, you'll likely miss it the first drive by. Turning around is worth it.  Yes the staff tends to be the typical hipster, bike-riding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops, but they're friendly and unpretentious, so don't hold it against them.  The patrons are almost exclusively college students (anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go), though hipsters are actually in the minority here.  Anyone under the age of 25 will fit in perfectly, and no one 35 and under will feel uncomfortable.    The noise level is perfect.  Most students are on their laptops with headphones, a few are chatting quietly, and the background (indie) music is just that.  You don't need headphones to concentrate here.  Decor is decent without being great.  The ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams, and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile.  So is the wallpaper, though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting.  Where it loses points is in the furnishings: the mixture of wall lamps, hanging fixtures, and pot lights doesn't work well, the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate, and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserably.  Iced water is provided, which is decent (plastic cups are a minus), but inferior to the mineral water other places serve. We tried their richly brewed Ethiopian to rave reviews, with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus (hefty and warming) or minus (hard to drink from). Truly fantastic coffee, but the lattes were rather disappointing: Beautifully steamed milk in every cup, but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a 5 star establishment.  The medium latte (12oz, with 2 shots of espresso -- the steongest ratio they offer) should have been far better.  The food looked worth having, but we'd just eaten. Homemade pastries and fresh sandwiches looked tempting, and we certainly will come hungrier next time.  A solid four stars, held back a bit by decor and a lot by espresso.",

    "text": "I was a little apprehensive & had my reservations about the place when I walked in. This is only due to the fact that all of the patrons were either douchebags / bitches doing their homework/studying/being a hipster, or parents with ugly screaming kids. I rarely get pissed at screaming kids, but I have come to learn that it's because most kids are cute. The ones at the cafe on Sunday were fugnation citizens. The douchey hipster bitches irritated me because they each took up an entire table (reserved for 2 or 4 patrons), and then proceeded to scowl and dart death stares at everyone else who was trying to talk or eat or make noise. LISTEN UP ASSHOLES, IT'S NOT A LIBRARY, SO DON'T GET PISSED WHEN THERE ARE NORMAL SOCIAL NOISES COMING FROM A PUBLIC CAFE. Besides, you are going to fail your exam/write something dumb on your macbook pro anyway, so either put your intellectual props away, or stop being an ass.   Ok, moving on. The cafe was easy to find, lots of parking along the street, and the location is great. The people who worked there were awesome. So kind, patient, and genuinely happy to be working there. The baked goods were phenomenal, and they are all made on site or locally. There were SO many to choose from! The artichoke pesto panini was delicious (just not hot; it actually got cold before I got half way through the first half of the sandwich), and the cappuccino was perfect. The ratio of coffee to milk & foam was exactly spot on.   I did end up eating as fast as I could and leaving because of the screaming kids and jerkface factor, but I would definitely visit the place again and get some coffee and make small talk with the baristas.",

The coffee selection is terrific.  The baristas are professional and courteous.  No, they are not chatty, but they are polite and friendly.  I'm not there for conversation, but for good coffee.  And that's what you get.    The pastries and snacks are fine.  Good variety.    The atmosphere is JUST what I want when I need a cup of coffee: relatively quiet, comfortable and calming.    When it first opened (how long ago how?) it was mobbed by some of my neighbors (I live in Highland Park) who adopted it as their private club and often seemed peeved at \"others\" who stopped by.   They've either relaxed or found other obsessions.  The clientele is, as folks said, eclectic and invigorating.    It's become our after-dinner spot after a meal at Park Bruges or Smiling Banana Leaf, too!",

A nice short walk from Highland Park is a welcome plus. Get the latte, take a stroll down the street to explore the houses, and take a walk in the park. That is a beautiful and coffeeful sunny summer afternoon for you.   They also have food, but I cannot speak for that. The interior is somewhat run down at places, but that gives it character.",

I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.  It is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.  Enrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.  Other reasons to love this place (I know some of the other reviews highlighted these but I thought they were worth repeating).  - free wifi - outside tables - tasty treats - they have a blog! - really great coffee - the staff are coffee experts",

So here's what I liked: the cappuccino was perfect. It's an awesome cappuccino, topped with a cute foam art leaf.  Here's what I didn't like: Sometimes I take my cappuccino plain, sometimes I take it with a shot of syrup. On this occassion I asked if I could get amaretto syrup, which they had. But the barista responded: \"No, you can't.\" He said they only make their cappuccino plain, and if I liked sweet, he could make me something special, but I would have to trust his taste. Here's the thing...I don't like sweet! I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I just wanted a tiny bit of sweet, so I didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. I just got it plain.  I'm not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a Starbucks-guzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a \"REAL\" cappuccino tasted like. Please, I lived in Italy, I've had a \"REAL\" cappuccino...but right now, I want a flavor shot in it. I still tipped because I wasn't sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place, and he did offer to make me something different. I just don't get what the deal is here...why do they even bother having flavor syrups if you're not \"allowed\" to add them to your drink?   It's a 5-star cappuccino for sure, but I had to subtract a star for the attitude.",

And the fact that since coming to P'burgh for a few days for the first time, it's the first aggregation of non-grumpy people I've been around. Well, to be fair, all the partying college students on the South Side last night were not grumpy. Maybe it's that the folks sitting around me here at Tozza Doro are just chilling, quietly dong whatever they are doing, and not being overly grumpy or self absorbed.   They don't apear to have more than coffee and pastries, but they do have free wireless.

There wasn't a lot of variety in coffee drinks, and I was under the presumption that they had an actual menu, like soups and sandwiches. Instead, they had a one page list of around 3 sandwiches and a soup of the day. I get it, they're small, but after all I have heard about them, I was a little surprised. So I ordered a mocha. The barista was very nice and very polite.   I sat down inside with my fiancee since the two outdoor seats were taken. It was a little weird. I thought it was going to being kind of an indie/artsy/fun little place, but it was kinda weird for me. The music was so quiet I could barely even hear it. Every time the front door opened, it squealed really loud, and I felt like I couldn't talk to my fiancee sitting right across from me with out the whole room hearing us. Some people were on their laptops, some people reading...it was a unique mix of people, mostly middle-aged. It was a little strange seeing a sad Charlie Brown-esqe Christmas tree sitting on the ground with it's lights still wrapped around it collecting dust, since it is May.   But back to the coffee...my mocha was okay. Nothing like \"wow\" but it was alright. Coffee is cheap.",

    "text": "The coffee was ok, but the service and ambiance left much to be desired. The place was dirty, with straw wrappers etc on the floor. The light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy. There were four people on staff but it took at least 2 minutes for one of them to stop gossiping with the others and take our order.  I got the feeling that this place has had a lot of success and the owners have let things slide. It was ok, but in looking for a coffee shop to make my regular hangout, I would not go back.",

It's nice to be able to bring your dog and sit outside in the warmer months, though! The staff is always so incredibly friendly and talkative - always there to suggest things and to make you laugh. Such a \"hometown\" type of environment.",

    "text": "I can remember the time when I used to strictly drink mocha frappuccinos from Starbuck's thinking that it was the be all end all to coffee in my younger teens. Don't we all miss those days of being so naive?   Admittedly, I never finish any coffee that I drink, not only because I'm apparently wasteful now that I think about it, but also because I'm a slow sipper and everything settles at the very end. Make no mistakes, I will finish any coffee drink from Tazza D'oro and at record speed. It is delicious to the very last drop and the best part is, they don't think that third degree burns go hand in hand with their coffee -- it's ready for drinking the moment you receive your order. Let's not forget about the food, which is also delicious. it's clear I have nothing bad to say about this establishment.  Some of the staff remembers your order to a tee and all of them are always very courteous. The prices are reasonable and the location is great, tucked away in Highland Park.",

    "text": "On my recent road trip from Dallas to New Haven, CT, Randy S. and I stopped in Pittsburgh to revel in its charms. This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, \"There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?\"   Tazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?  Let's go in order of importance:  Coffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema.   The coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior.   This is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more.   Pastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.  Atmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run.   Obviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, \"we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!\" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.  Tazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer.   Tazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do.   They have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \"we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better.   The lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \"main drag\" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.",
