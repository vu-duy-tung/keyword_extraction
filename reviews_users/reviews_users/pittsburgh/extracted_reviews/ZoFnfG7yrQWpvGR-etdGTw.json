The beer is cheap ($1.50 daily draft specials), they have great food specials, and a fun place to go with a big group. I always stick with the wraps and you can't go wrong with the 11-11:45 1/2 price lunch menu.  Another hidden secret about this place is their pizzas are amazing!",

    "text": "Loads of people love this place because of the \"half-off\" menu. I can tell you, half-price is what you *should* pay for the quality of the food. Normally, their burgers are around $9, but they are not worth that price, even with the delicious fries. The beers are overpriced for the kind of bar it is (re: college bro bar).   This place is loud as hell. I don't really understand why. If their was a dance area, sure, blast away. But there isn't, at least not in the main area where everyone is drinking.   Their beer selection isn't too bad. They have most large brewery beers as well as quite a few crafts. Like I said though, the prices aren't great.   There are bros, everywhere. You can't avoid them, as it's always packed full. Most people seem to have been drunk before they get there, so you will have to deal with drunk sorority girls as well as beer-blasting bros.   My advice? Unless you're into the freshmen/sophomore college scene, find another bar.",

    "text": "The Food: Decent, if not underwhelming, bar food at a reasonable price. The sandwiches are sizeable and their fries are nicely seasoned and crisp. Pasta is cooked competently and is actually better than Joe Mama's down the street. There's a whole menu page of creative, satisfying grilled cheeses. The food's an absolute steal during Hem's twice daily half-offs, but still not bad at full price.  The Drink: If you're trying to drink high end or top shelf, turn away. However, if you're okay with deeply discounted drinks and above average macro beer you're in luck. Yuengling pitchers are always $6, and every weekday a pint of a decent draft (Sam Adams, New Castle, Blue Moon, or Magic Hat) is $2. Shot pitchers are about $5, super girly, and good to share with a friend. I've never had to spend more than $15 at Hem's for a good time.  The Atmosphere and Service: This is where Hem's gets a star knocked off. On the plus side, there's usually a spot to grab a seat, even on a crowded Friday or Saturday night. Hem's has a markedly convivial atmosphere and unique charm, especially for Pitt students. The DJ on weekends is fairly good and spins music that's neither unique nor grating, which is actually a good thing because you go to Hem's to drink and socialize, not dance. On the negative, the waiters don't offer the most timely service (even when it's not too crowded). Also, the bar is arranged oddly and moving around is a chore. If you're not a fan of Pittsburgh sports, make sure there's not a Penguins or Steelers game when you go, as fans are super obnoxious during those times.  Overall, it's become my go-to spot in Oakland. Definitely give it a try.",

This was a go-to for (likely ill-advised) late Wednesdays starting with those infamous shot pitchers and ending with a $5 pizza picked up on the way home and eaten happily on a friend's porch, pre-night class grilled cheeses (seriously, so delicious) during senior year of college, and a frequent stop on birthday nights out on the town. I've had the opportunity to go back twice now in my 5th (...ergh) year out of college: once, solo, to linger over a beer (I believe a not-too-shabby IPA that was on draft) following a Drue Heinz lecture on an unseasonably warm December night, which made for a beautiful evening of people watching as the hazy Christmas lights above the bar twinkled, as well as a milestone celebration with a dear friend and former college roommate on a \"throwback Thursday\" (ugh, that makes me sound old) which did involve a shot pitcher (or two). I think Hem's still hosts poetry on summer weeknights here and there, which was another highlight of Oakland summers in between semesters. Hem's is definitely the site of more than a few of my favorite Pitt memories.",

Despite the fact that I am far past my college years, it was still enjoyable. There is a decent beer selection - I typically only drink microbrews, but if you like Miller Lite, this is the place to go to get it cheap.  Our service was pretty bad after the game - not because it was busy but because our waiter was horrible. We never saw him again after he took our order - someone else dropped off our food, and then we had to find him to ask for the check. But that didn't really bother me, given that our food was half off since it was \"late night\", and my Hot Honey wrap and the fries that came with it were delicious.",

The front room is claustrophobic, and though the back isn't as packed, good luck trying to have a conversation at a normal speaking volume.  Even though I'm only in my mid-twenties, I feel way old and crochety among the people who clog the place.  As other reviewers have said, you can't beat the price of the beer specials here.  The cardiac stix (deep fried provolone sticks) and the spinach artichoke dip (served with deep fried pita bread slices) are pretty decent appetizers to share.  The low prices might encourage you to order more, but the waitstaff can be so elusive that you'll just end up asking for your check the next time you see your server.  If cheap beer and food are your top priorities, and atmosphere matters very little, then Hemingway's will do.  I'd rather walk a little farther from Pitt and go to Panther Hollow Inn near the corner of Forbes and Craig.",

Definitely swing by this bar for a good beer, good food, and great friends!  For a college bar, the seasonal beer selection is quite impressive as well.  In the fall, there is a great selection of pumpkin beers, including my personal favorite Southern Tier Pumking.",

    "text": "I stopped in a little after 11 on a Monday for the half-off menu (which is offered from 11 to 12 and 2 to 4 on weekdays, and from 9 to 11 every day). Probably because of the time, most people were there eating lunch, and the atmosphere was more like that of a restaurant. But the decorations were a constant reminder that Hemingway's is, in fact, a bar. And although it was early, the place was pretty busy by the time I left.  The staff were very nice, and my server was very attentive. I didn't have to wait for anything, even when all her tables were filled. She seemed to devote the same attention to her other tables as well.  I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip (which I've never eaten before) because I'd heard so many good things about it. From pictures, I could tell it was some sort of cheesy dip, but Hem's exceeded my expectations. The fried pita bread also helped a lot. The dip itself was perfectly cheesy and so creamy, with tender chunks of artichoke that still had some bite to them. There were also bits of red--hot peppers, perhaps? The dish had a spicy kick that, for me, was tolerable (meaning it'd probably be unnoticeable for most people), and it was served piping hot. This combination forced me to slow down and enjoy every bite. The pita chips were crispy but not fried all the way through, which I loved! Though one downside was the greasy taste, it was easily remedied with an extra scoop of dip. And for me, there was a perfect ratio of chips to dip. (Then again, I was the only one eating it, so double dipping was absolutely acceptable.)  With the half-price deal, a charge of $1 is added if you don't order alcohol. I paid less than six dollars plus tip for a yummy, filling meal. I'll definitely be back to try some other things from their menu.",

It can get noisy and crowded later on weeknights and on the weekends, but the staff are all very skilled at working with a high noise level and everyone I've encountered has been really chill.  My boyfriend first took me here for late night half price food (9:00pm-mightnight and also available during the lunch hour) right after we began dating, and we've been back at least ten times together since. That's a lot considering the amount of new restaurants we like to try. It was one of his regular spots in college, and I can definitely see why. I love the wood paneled booths and walls and all the framed photos of friends having an epic time here over the years. You can tell it's a well-loved establishment. The food is also fairly decent for a college bar, and at half price time it's a steal. Additionally they offer cheap pitchers of cocktails/beer/shots and a different $2.50 draft beer special every evening, so you can easily have dinner and a drink for under $10 with a tip. Overall Hem's is a solid late-night place if you aren't allergic to undergrads or loud music, and in the winter the cozy atmosphere makes it especially appealing.",

Like other yelpers, I think Hemingways can be hit or miss. Service is usually good. They have pretty decent prices and somewhat decent bar food. It is BAR FOOD though. Burgers, sandwiches, fries, tots, and a few salads. Don't expect it to be gourmet, because it really is a dive-y college bar. Even with their two happy hours per day, they also run a daily special on a specific type of beer or drink. The shot pitchers are fun and have gummy worms thrown on top. And although I like the shot pitchers, they are more like \"mixed drink pitchers.\"  Still, it is good at what it does: being a college dive bar.",

    "text": "As a Pitt student, Hem's has a special place in my heart. They are the only bar that I know of that serves shot pitchers which basically is a huge mixed drink in a pitcher water is usually served out of at restaurants and topped off with small plastic \"shot\" containers and gummy worms. My favorites are the Pathfinder and Jolly Rancher. They have a huge selection and there are specials on certain days. The atmosphere of Hem's is casual. I would give Hem's all five stars except it has one downfall which is that is gets ridiculously loud with people yelling to talk to you and the DJ playing music.   Most people go to Hem's for the drinks and to hang out with their friends but do not forget about their bar food. I highly recommend the pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich and spinach artichoke dip. If you go there during certain times, they have half off.  Hem's is the perfect college bar to hang out with friends, grab some shot pitchers and food, and unwind from the week!",

I felt like I was the oldest person there, and I'm only 26. There is a noticeable smell of stale beer, but the stuff they pour is fine.   I probably wouldn't go back myself, but it's really not my kind of thing. Great college dive bar if you're an undergrad probably.",

The chicken tenders are really tasty and when you order tater tots, you don't just get a side of them, you get a BOAT of them! (I'm serious guys, tater tot boats, check it out). They also have great drink specials! I'm not a beer drinker so it's nice when I go to a place that has deals on liquor too.  The staff are very friendly and do their best to make sure you're taken care of.  I went to the poetry event they had a few days ago and they made sure that everyone attending had been asked if they needed anything (even the latecomers).   Final Thought: Great place for grabbing a drink or a bite with coworkers or friends.",

Not going to lie, it's our number one homecoming destination. (H2P) The food is typical bar food, but done right.  I have had basically everything on the menu, and you can't go wrong. A few favorites are the spinach and artichoke dip, extreme buffalo wrap, turkey club wrap.  I am sad that they no longer carry the curly fries. Those were my shiz!!!  It can get quite busy on a Friday or Saturday evening, and service can slow down, but they definitely do their best. I love me some Hems and I ALWAYS make sure to pop in whenever I'm in Oakland.

Even though they changed the special from half price to $5 (admittedly a marginal change in most cases, but still) the food deals offered from 11-noon and 2-4 are a great bargain. The food is always better than I expect. The spinach and artichoke dip is the best I've ever had, with fresh fried pita wedges, and the Buffalo chicken wrap, while perhaps not \"extreme\" as the menu claims, is great. I also enjoy their daily $2.50 draft specials. Recently they've offered Southern Tier Live on Wednesdays, and a good Raging Dog blood orange IPA on Saturdays. You really can't beat a 7% draft for $2.50. The service is very hit or miss. If your bartender is chatting up someone at the bar, you can be waiting a loooooong time for a refill, or your check. But for the prices and the generally good food and drink, it's worth the risk.",

I will agree with most people that it is a staple for college students and is the ideal place on a weeknight to go and drink. The shot pitchers are not really up my alley, they're sugary and weak but the cheap pitchers of beer definitely keep me coming back.  The happy hours are a little confusing to get used to since they are always at odd times, like noon or 10pm, but the specials are totally worth it.  My biggest problem with this place would have to be that the food is not good. At all. But I usually go for the cheap beer and Hem's hasn't failed at that yet. I'll be back many more times!",

Pretty good for only going three or four times a month! Lots of beers on tap, mostly IPA's and Lagers. I would like some more wheat beers or wit-beers. The $2.50 pints change every day, but at the moment they are only IPAs on that deal special, kinda sucks if you hate IPAs. Can't beat the $8 Blue Moon pitchers though. The shot pitchers are really sweet, but they're fun. I can't do that much sugar, but my friends all love them and the gummy worms that come with them. They come with \"shot glasses\", but people usually just ask for a straw. I love the $4 whiskey gingers! I'm not gonna find another bar this well priced.  The food is great! Spinach and Artichoke dip is my favorite appetizer and I usually order it for a meal. Other times, I order the buffalo chicken wrap, I think its called the Extreme Wrap or something, and its always amazing. These sweet potato fries are my weakness.There's $5 food menu times and the menu is so extensive on that I can't think of what's excluded.",

Love the Dum-Dums that come floating on top... one time they must have been out and we had gummi worms floating in our pitcher. Try the Black Out and the Miley Cyrus.   Can't go wrong with the food. The spinach and artichoke dip has a kick but the pita chips are the absolute best! Grilled cheeses are some of the best. Cloggin' Fries... OMG.

There's always some kind of special for $1 or $2. It's also awesome that they have shots called \"Taylor Swift\" and \"Miley Cyrus.\"   I've tried a few of their pasta dishes,and have always been unimpressed. Their burgers and fries, however, are very delicious, and at half-off run at only $4 to fill you up! My friend insists that yelp needs to have more subcategories for bars, and classifies this as a college bar, not a dive bar. I guess it's True, probably 98% of their customers are college students from around Pittsburgh, and probably 80% of them are Pitt students.",

Only a few feet from the Pitt store, and all the other restaurants in the vicinity of campus, Hemingway's Cafe's name could be a bit misleading. Rather than being a traditional cafe where fresh, homemade meals are mixed up from scratch, the main attraction is beer and great prices.  I came here to meet my cousin for lunch (who goes to school at Pitt) and she explained to me that students come here for two reasons: dirt cheap food and beer. There's 40 beers on tap, friendly service and impressove prices for the portions divvied up.   Don't expect award winning food. Everything looked and tasted average, but surrounded by so many average chains a bite at Hemingway's isn't a bad thing. Another plus is the menu offers a wide range of choices that can satisfy anyone's craving. Keep in mind, it's also one of the few places open til 2am and with a kitchen cooking till midnight.",

We just left this place about 20 minutes ago and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had with a restaurant. Our server took our orders, then forgot our orders and had to ask us again. Which like no big deal people forget things, but then it took a solid 40 minutes for our food to come out. I understand if the restaurant was busy, but there was literally 2 other people!!! It was completely empty. So, we finally get our food and I asked the server for ranch. I guess he forgot or something though, because he proceeded to sit at the bar for 20 minutes with the other servers talking. Now is the worst part. The food was so disgusting. The burger we had was pale and anemic looking, our fries were cold (probably because the server took forever to bring our food). I don't even complain much and the only reason I'm going out of my way to write this review is because I ordered the French onion soup and it was so salty it was inedible. After being ignored for a solid 20 minutes while our waiter was sitting at the bar, he finally came over. I very nicely asked for my ranch which he completely forgot and said that the soup was way too salty and I couldn't eat it. He proceeded to tell me that it was just really salty sometimes and there's nothing he can do about it. I've never had such a bad experience at a restaurant. There wasn't one good thing about the place.",

Sit at the bar or squish into small booths in the front, or when you arrive in hoards after all your friends freshly turn 21 you can make yourself at home in the large backroom seating up to 20 people around a table.   Now me, I bonded with my best friend at Hemingways, sneaking in 1 [or sometimes 2] $1.75 Miller Lites [$1.5 at the time] between classes from Sennott Square to the Cathedral in our 30 minute break with our favorite bartender [We miss you HC!] and eating lots of $5 late night foods.  The awesomeness: Hem's has 3 [that's right] food special times a day. Lunch time rush from 11-12pm, 2-4pm and late night 9-midnight for a $5 menu with the purchase of a beer. The food is gushy goodness that only happens when you use too much Sysco grease. [Try the new pull pork fries, they are awesome] My junior year of college [will not divulge how long ago that was] Hem's created their signature \"Shot pitchers\" which are oversized sugary drinks topped with silly things like candy necklaces and gummy worms and named after celebrities. It's only fitting that my favorite is a constant match-off between the Taylor Swift and the Katy Perry. [TS for the WIN!]   And of course, it's super cheap. Which is just great for my returning to student status graduate budget.  The not so awesome: It's a college bar. So, by definition, it's usually crowded, very loud and noisy at night and you must elbow your way through the crowd of high-fiving frat boys. Second, the bathrooms are small, dirty and far too often out of TP or plain out of order. It's awful.   Timeless and classic Hem's will always have a spot in my heart and I will make it a point to return often.",

    "text": "I can't stop raving about this place ever! I originally gave Hemingway's a four star rating due to the fact that the place is extremely cramped with college kids. However, after my experience last night I am gladly updating to five stars!   I've only ever visited Hemingway's during school season so naturally it's flooded with the college crowd. Last night, my boyfriend and I decided to grab some cheap eats and drinks before heading out to a club for the night. Coming here in the summer is sooo much better. There still is a decent crowd, but it's much more calm and you don't have to scream like crazy for the person across from you to hear what you're saying.   The food was amazing (as usual)! We ordered nachos as an appetizer. They were doused in spicy cheese, olives, peppers, salsa and sour cream. I had the \"ABC Wrap,\" which was a delicious wrap stuffed with avocado, bacon and chicken. My boyfriend had the Rachel and loved it! I'm not a fan of 1000 island dressing, but even after taking a bite I was in love! We also ordered a pitcher of Miller Light because it's only $5 24/7! The drinks and food came to only $19 because we were there during one of their three happy hours throughout the day. Most food is half off and you can find some awesome drink specials! You can't get any better!",

    "text": "I went here shortly after my 21st birthday because I'd been hearing for years how fun it is on Thursday nights, and how much I should try the shot pitcher special. At no fault to the restaurant, I was under the impression that the shot pitchers would be $4 on special, and were in fact $8. Like I said, my misunderstanding. This would be fine, if the pitchers were actually enjoyable in any way whatsoever. Sweet to the point I couldn't even finish it--I can't even say with certainty that there was more than 1 shot of liquor to about a liter of liquid. Will never order again. Drinks are a personal preference, however so that isn't the purpose for a 2 star review. I had an absolutely awful experience with the waitstaff. As my boyfriend and I were waiting for a table on an incredibly crowded Thursday night, a waitress came up behind us and screamed \"YOU GUYS SERIOUSLY NEED TO MOVE SO I CAN GET THROUGH\" instead of asking calmly for us to move, which we would have happily obliged. I've waitresses for years at my family's bar and would never dream of treating customers like that. She then proceeded to blast by us and shoot us looks for the rest of the night. Three stars lost for price, quality, and service. 2 stars remaining for the atmosphere and the fact that they serve a full menu. May have to try it again during the day when I can sit down and relax enough to reread the drink menu and when waitstaff isn't so testy.",

It's pretty much your typical college-oriented dive bar, and is as loud and divey as you'd expect of this type of establishment.  The highlight of my visit during the evening hours was the $5 pitchers of sweet alcoholic drinks with candy--though be careful, because these types of drinks will get you drunk in no time, esp. if you're not a big drinker, like me!  One lesser-known aspect of Hem's is that it's open for lunch hour.  I came here with my labmates during lunchtime about a year ago, and my sandwich, the Alabama Slammer, was actually surprisingly decent (I had low expectations for the food here).  Given that few people think of coming to Hem's during the off hour of lunch, it wasn't crowded at all, and service wasn't half-bad.  If you're looking for an off-the-beaten path place to have a casual sit-down lunch in Oakland, I'd recommend it!  3.5 stars.",

    "text": "You know you're getting older when you walk into your old college hangouts and, while still feeling nostalgic, recognize exactly why those old hangouts are no longer a regular part of your life. Don't get me wrong, I will definitely always enjoy Hemingway's for what it is - a good place to get some pretty delicious fries, to stop in for pretty decent deals on beer, and to give in to my cravings for large burgers, gyros, and a range of fried appetizers. And if I'm ever looking for a place to eat reasonably priced pierogies I'll always consider coming here to get them, as their giant bowl of pierogies makes a meal in and of itself even if it's on the appetizer menu.  But now that I'm a few years out of college, I also know that I'll never come to Hemingway's in the evening during Pitt's spring and fall semesters again. No longer do I have it in me to tolerate screaming tipsy students blowing off steam after classes. And I'm definitely growing older if I'm noticing the rips and tears in the booths and dings and scratches in tables and on the walls. Those things didn't matter to me once.   Although in a way, they still don't. It's Hemingway's - no one goes here expecting the ritz. And if you're looking for a quick bar-like sort of place, honestly as long as you avoid the student rush (i.e. stop in during their daylight hours or even in the evening during the summer) I think Hemingway's is definitely a place to consider, with its quick service and a menu of bar-food type goodness that just hits the spot when you're craving some affordable bar-food goodness. Sure, it's no longer a favorite place for me to hang out, especially since if I've failed to eat reasonably healthy foods throughout the day before eating here I feel awful (yep, definitely getting older!) - but it's still an a-ok place to eat if you're in the mood for what they have, and I'll always look back on my old college watering hole fondly.  So thanks for the memories, Hems - and I'll be back the next time I want some of your delicious french fries!",

The chicken was tender but the sweet potato fries that it was served on was mushy and not appetizing. The vegetables were the kind that you get from the freezer aisle in Giant Eagle and you microwave on those sad lonely nights that you eat over your kitchen sink.

But with all this fun watch out. The place gets packed. I mean so full you can't move! So get there early and snag a seat or table even on some weekdays.

Their menu has plenty of choices and it's a late night food spot that doesn't leave me feeling greasy! I do wish that their wings had the late night discount but I guess I'll have to go to Mad Mex or Fuel and Fuddle for that. **If you don't order a drink, they will charge you a dollar.** I went for a gin and tonic because they had $2 well drinks after 10 that night. There are tons of other specials here, and I would refer to their website for specifics. The service here is always pretty fast, even when they're busy.  HAWAIIAN BURGER ($5 late night): I don't remember if that was what it was called, but it had a slice of pineapple and that was my best guess. I enjoy a good burger sometimes, and this satisfied my craving. 4 ALARM CHICKEN PASTA ($5 late night): WHAT. THIS IS MY NEW GO-TO MEAL HERE. It isn't too spicy, but has a nice kick to it. The portion size is just enough for me, and for $5 at their late night happy hour I'm not complaining. The chicken does look like tofu though.. but I ate it all anyways. Ay dios mio, muy delicioso. SHOT PITCHERS: I would advise coming with a group of friends and sharing a few. Not too strong, but usually very sweet. They also come with gummy worms or pop rock candy. The Pathfinder and Gummi Bear are the two I've tried and liked so far.   I would say Hems has the best bar food on Pitt campus and a well deserved 5 stars for their service, food, drinks, and atmosphere.",

    "text": "I love Hem's! Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland by far, both for the food and the drinks. Granted it is a college dive bar in the heart of Pitt's campus, so for all of you who are post-grads, know that it does get crowded with college students during the fall and spring semesters. Throughout the day there is usually a mix of students older adults in the space because of their multiple happy-hour times (with a $5 food menu!!). On Thursday/Friday/Saturday nights, the crowd is usually mostly students because the DJ starts playing music at 11pm. If you don't have friends reserving a table already, it's hard to get a table during the weekend night hours!  One thing to keep in mind when coming here if you are celebrating your 21st - they don't let you in the morning you turn 21 at midnight (aka at 12:01 am). You have to wait until the night of your birthday to get in to Hem's.  The food is great! They have great buffalo chicken dip and fries, which are both my go-to. As for their drinks, us college students go for their shot-pitchers (half-off long island shot pitchers on Thursdays 10-midnight, half-off captain and coke shot pitchers on Fridays 10-midnight!) or their beer pitchers. They have a large selection of shot pitchers on their menu, and the shot pitcher can either be split with someone or for one person! Many of their pitchers come with gummy worms in the drink, which is always a plus.   The bouncers are strict with underagers, but they are also attentive to the crowd at Hem's. My friends and I have had a couple instances involving some creepy patrons, but the bouncers always made sure we were okay and took care of the situation, so shout out to you guys! Every time I've been to Hem's, I've always had an awesome time!",

There's a large room in the back which is great for groups so this is especially convenient. You may be surprised, but they have a really delicious summer strawberry salad.

It's conveniently located near my work, so I go for lunch sometimes with coworkers, or sometimes after work for happy hour.  It's a college bar. It can get crowded and loud. There's nothing special about the drinks. They're not fancy cocktails, but sometimes it's good to just grab a rum and coke or a beer somewhere. This place is great for that. There tends to be a mix of all ages early on since a lot of university and hospital employees go for happy hours. It's louder and not really my type of place later on when the college kids really start taking over, but if you go earlier in the day, it's fine.  They have $5 food specials for lunch, mid afternoon and again late night, so lots of opportunities to score some cheap food. I like their wraps a lot, and really love the spinach artichoke dip. It's some of the best dip I've had.   It's not worth going out of your way for, but Hemingways is great if you're in the area and need to grab a quite bite or drink.",

    "text": "I'm an advocate of a great dive bar.  I actually like going to dive bars because it is more entertaining and more of a laid back atmosphere.  I enjoy that type of setting in a bar.  But you will not find that here.  I wish they had a subgroup on Yelp that says \"college bar\" or something of the like.  Because that is what this truly is.  A college bar.  This isn't my first visit to Hemingway's but it will probably be my last (for the bar experience at least).  I have eaten here before, and from what I remember they have a great turkey burger, but I am focusing on the bar experience for this review.  The best way to experience this place is probably by coming here when there are no students in the area, that or don't come at all.  Tons of college kids everywhere with their \"I know better\" attitude (I can say that, I use to be one myself).  Which made for an uncomfortable experience for me.  I did my time in college and I don't like the vibe of a place like this anymore.  Oh how it feels to grow up.  Let's break it down some, besides this being your typical college bar they don't vary much on what is offered in regards to libations.  Limited beer selection and it appears that a majority of the liquor available is not top shelf.  Every beer I asked for they didn't have, on tap or bottled.  After my third try at getting a beer, I gave up.  No thank you to the gimmicky picture drinks you have either.  If I wanted to be hyper and drunk at the same time I wouldn't be here to do that.  I have no idea what the appeal of gummy worms in drinks is.    As far as the bartenders, rude.  If you see me struggling to see what you have available and shooting down every single beer I have selected, how about you either give me a list or tell me what you do have.  I don't need no shade thrown my way unless you want me to overwork my bitch look in your direction.  It's not my fault you are behind the bar with people yelling at you.",

I moved from Los Angeles for Grad School, and going to Hemingway's on Friday nights is always something I look forward to after a long, hectic week.  Hemingway's has excellent happy hour deals EVERYDAY (except Sundays, because they are closed). Also, their beer prices are the best in town. I have never seen such low beer prices in my life. I always get the $5 Miller lite pitcher, such an awesome deal. They also do daily beer specials (check out their website for the deets), my friends and I used to show up every Thursday after class for the $2 pint of dogfish head. :)  Anyhoo, the wait staff always does such a fantastic job (shout out to Lindsay aka \"Hoagie\", she is one of the best!). My only gripe about the place is that it gets suuuuper packed at night, around 10-11pm. But I'm not complaining because it gives Hemingway's business and allows them to keep the prices low. Love this place and I will always remember it where ever I end up :)",

The server went to get the manger, who proceeded to tell me the but was not under cooked. We asked did she taste it? She did no she's did thousands and they are all cooked perfectly!!! She then stated she would not replace or refund the burger; however the ENTIRE burger went to the back never to be seen again.

Several of my experiences with Hem's involve late night shot pitchers with a group of friends, but most recently I went to happy hour at Hem's with a friend and we ended up spending the night eating apps, drinking several pitchers, and playing trivia. At first, the bar was empty, but Hem's isn't usually the go-to happy hour place. After a while, more people came for food, drinks, and trivia, and in no time the room had a nice din to it.   We ordered the spinach artichoke dip, a summer shandy pitcher, a miller lite pitcher, cheese fries, and two bottles of blue moon (yeah, we had ourselves a day). Promoters were even walking around with free shots, which were quite delicious!!   Out of the two appetizers ordered, I enjoyed the spinach artichoke dip more. The dip was quite thick but flavorful, and the pita was fried, which left the pita a tad greasy and heavy with the rich, creamy dip. Nonetheless, still a great option if you're looking to indulge. On the other hand, the cheese fries were not that impressive to me. It seemed as though they put shredded cheese on bland fries and broiled it. I do not think I will spring for that option again.   In terms of libations, the beer was COLD and PLENTIFUL. At the end of the night, I expected to get bombarded with a huge check, but all of that was still under $15. In conclusion, you can get drunk for cheap, and the eats are decent.",

Hem's has been voted one of America's best college bars, and it definitely deserves that. The food here is delicious, and it is especially worth it when it is half off (11am-12pm, 2pm-4pm, 9pm-12am)! ...but remember to tip on the full price even though food is half off! I highly recommend the pulled pork grilled cheese, the Philly cheesesteak wrap and the spinach-artichoke dip. And you must get their sweet potato fries! They have some of the best sweet potato fries. During half off hours, they'll charge you $1 if you don't buy a drink, but you'd be crazy to go in here and not get yourself a shot pitcher (unless you're under 21). I think the Long Island shot pitcher is the best bang for your buck (and it comes with gummy worms on top). Most of the shot pitchers are pretty great, with a few being kind of gross. But the gummy worms are definitely worth the buy. At night, this is one of the best bars in Oakland. Sometimes it can get overcrowded, but it is generally still super fun. The DJ isn't always the best and the ones that are there don't actually care about properly DJing (proper transitions, etc.) but I like that they sometimes take requests. Lindsey is the best bartender and waitress there because she is the nicest, friendliest, and most attentive! Overall, great bar and I love the food, atmosphere, and drinks!",

Their chips are nice, they're deep fried pita basically and there's buffalo chicken dip and spinach artichoke dip, both are good and served hot. The bad thing is that they only give you a few chips and charge you for more (which makes sense, but the initial chip serving is really stingy!)

    "text": "As a student in Pittsburgh, it seems that Hemingway's is a rite of passage.  To mark the end of my first semester of graduate school, my friend and I came here for some lunch time day drinking after an 8 AM final.  There were quite a few other students in there, mostly undergrads with a head start.  It was not terribly crowded but very loud.  Hemingway's has MULTIPLE happy hours.  Yes.  Lunch time from 11 AM to 12 PM happens to be a happy hour with half priced sandwiches!  What?!?!  Instantly impressed.  Here are some food thoughts: Jolly Rancher Shot Pitcher ($7)- This had a quite a few shots within it, and I split it with my friend.  It was green apple flavored, but honestly, it was mostly sugar and not much alcohol.  I couldn't even feel the alcohol afterwards.  But the gummy worms in the pitcher were awesome.  Buffalo Chicken Wrap (Normally $8.99, $4.50 at happy hour)- The wrap was delicious.  Not too spicy, just right!  Probably one of the best versions of this wrap I've ever had.  I made the mistake, though, of opting for coleslaw over the french fries.  Bad decision.  Get the french fries!!!  They are seasoned and perfection!!!  Massive case of buyer's remorse.  The coleslaw was pretty boring.  Get the french fries.  Trust me.  My friend ordered a burger, and it was massive.  At the same price as my wrap, I was totally jealous.  The burger looked and smelled amazing, and I plan to get one when I come back.  Service isn't particularly fast, but most people are there to just hang out, so it is cool.  The service was very friendly and good, though.  The only odd thing is that if you do NOT order a drink, there is a $1 up-charge.",

As someone over 30 I couldn't in good conscious order a pitcher of shots (without becoming ill from the insane amount of sugar and alcohol) but no worries, because \"Hems\" always has a great selection of beer on draft.  The grad school crew favorite was the pita chips and artichoke dip.  Rich, creamy and full of fat.  And delicious.  The I-Need-To-Eat-Healthy version of myself loves the selection of wraps, with the hot honey wrap taking center stage.  Instead of fries I always opt for mashed potatoes.    The wait staff here is great and have worked there for many years.  They're friendly and go out of their way to make sure you're enjoying yourself and that your glass is never empty.    The atmosphere is pure college.  Small booths and crowded throughways.  So turn your nose down and enjoy it for what it is - a great college bar and restaurant.",

You have to be careful with what you order though because not everything is excellent.   The Long Island shot pitcher is Thursday's special ($4 after 10:00 PM) and brings in massive Thursday night crowds. It's definitely worth it. The jack honey pitcher is also pretty good. Some of the other shot pitchers are too sweet. Most of the food menu is $5.50 from 9 PM-12 AM. The tortellini big plate and the spinach artichoke dip are my personal favorites. Both are super creamy and delicious. The portion sizes are generous.   For a late night hangout, you can't get better than Hems.

    "text": "I don't know where to begin with Hem's. It's a small bar on Forbes that if you weren't looking for it, you easily could miss it. But that's what makes it so great. On the inside, it's narrow and long so when it's packed, it's kind of hard to move around and walk through the crowd. In the back they have a more open area with a few tables but I have to say that this area is my least favorite spot in the bar. It reminds me of a church hall that you would throw a raffle party in or something. I always gravitate to the front area and when I'm there, I have a great time.   Hem's is most certainly known for their shot pitchers and half off food. Both live up to that hype in my opinion. On certain nights, they do half off a particular shot pitcher from 10-12. The best and the most popular is the Thursday Long Island Pitcher night. I mean, who doesn't love LIT for under $4? In addition to the pitchers, they have great deals on beer and a wide variety of craft beers to chose from.   The food is another story. They have a pretty extensive menu that expands beyond typical bar food. They have pastas, sandwiches, salads, burgers, wraps, and a variety of appetizers. I always get a wrap or a burger. My favorite being the Baja burger but swapped with a veggie burger. It is to die for. I also always get their mashed potatoes for a side. The mashed potatoes are their best kept secret because they are AMAZING. The best time to go is when they do their $5.50 menu. It's from 11-12, 2-4, and 9-12. I think that's when it's most worth it just because some of the portions are a little small for costing $9+.   Hem's is an Oakland classic and I will always love it.",

It was a beautiful day outside and they turned off the lights which bothered me a bit. I don't want to drink in the dark at 5pm.   Music was fun and not so loud that you couldn't hear yourself think. Drinks were good and strong, tons of choices on the menu. Bartenders were personable and quick which I appreciate. Prices are a little much during non-Happy Hour Times but still reasonable.   I would return but maybe later in the evening where it doesn't feel as odd sitting in the dark.",

    "text": "This is THE official bar of The University of Pittsburgh. Don't come at me arguing for Peter's Pub, Garage Door, Pittsburgh Cafe, Uncle Jimmy's, etc. You are wrong. And yes, I'm aware some of those places no longer currently exist. Hemmingway's will outlast them all anyways.  If you go there, it will probably be crowded, and almost no patrons will be over the age of 25. Much of their menu is either greasy and/or fried, but if you are there during one of their (many) food special window times, it will be cheap(er). One aspect that has evolved is their beer selection. Namely, it's substantially better than you'd expect for the area. Flights are available. They also have a diverse selection of shot pitchers. The alcohol content of them is questionable, but if you're drinking something neon-colored with a group of people, it's more about having fun and socializing anyways.   During the daytime I'm sure people will stop in for a sandwich and a beer, but once the sun goes down the ambience is that of a college house party. They know they have to appeal to modern college kids who can access ride-sharing with a push of a button and aren't just stranded in Oakland anymore. They do this with a diverse menu full of comfort food and cheap drinks, and it works. Weeknights have occasional bar trivia. Weekends usually have a DJ. If Pitt is in session, Hemmingway's is packed.  I'm in my 30's now and I rarely go there anymore, unless it's before a Pitt basketball game, which is well within walking distance. When I do go though, it reminds me of college and my early 20's, when I was there far more often than I'd like to admit. This is a cheap college bar, and if you look at it through that lens, it's one of the best. If I were basing this review solely on emotion and nostalgia, it's an automatic five stars from me. For someone who doesn't have the same connection but is willing to brave the undergrads, expect a four star experience for beer selection and pricing.",

LOVE to see it. Love all of the waiters and waitresses, and the bouncers are super cool and bend your ID basically in half so it's not a fake.

I love love love love their spinach and artichoke dip. I get it every time. Ask for the pita warmed rather than fried, tastes better in my opinion and also makes you feel a little less guilty. Burgers are delicious and huge and it's totally worth swapping for sweet potato fries for an extra $1. Salads are also really big and delicious as well.  I come here somewhat often but I don't ever think I've had something that I did NOT like. Good food with huge portions for only $5? It's hard to be disappointed with that. They have beer specials daily as well as $4 pitchers starting from 10 PM which is always totally worth it in my opinion. Come in for late night dinner at 9 PM (for $5) and then grab a pitcher to start your night! Always a blast every time and the service can get kinda sparse sometimes when they get super packed with people, but they always do the best that they can. And I always seem to get the same waitress every time and she's awesome each time.",

    "text": "Ah, Hemingway's. The holy grail for Pitt Litchfield Towers freshman. Every weekend, countless Towers residents walk past the tempting allure of Hem's bumping music and sidewalk vomit on their way to a fruitless, South Oakland party search. Built into the structure of the University's iconic residence halls, Hem's is a awesome spot for several reasons.  During the day, Hem's is a great place to grab a drink and a bite to eat. The menu is pretty extensive, and \"Tot-Cho's\" (tater-tot nachos) are (in)famous member of trans fat culture. Throughout the day, $5 meal deals cover about 72% of the menu. There is a daytime slot and a nighttime slot. Beware, a $1 \"drink charge\" is a applied if you don't buy one yourself.  Hem's can be a wild place on weekends. It combines everything that makes a good college bar. A DJ to dance to, drink deals each night, and plenty of corners to hunker into if you need to have a serious talk with some friends. From about 9PM-midnight (check me on that), Hems offers a $4 shot pitcher. It's essentially mixed drink in a giant water pitcher. Each night is a different \"special\" and each are effective in reducing braincells as desired. Drink choices are extensive, and I've barely scraped the surface of the beers they offer. You're bound to run into people you know at Hem's, as it is the bar of choice for many of those involved on campus.  Hemingway's is a staple of the Oakland and Pitt experience. The diversity of experiences and awesome memories I've formed with my friends will have us returning to the bar as creepy 30-somethings, trying to relive moments our collegiate pasts.",

While I didn't eat there, someone at the table next to me ordered a platter of pierogis that looked and smelled awesome.

People were literally lined up and waiting to to get a seat and standing room was almost non-existent by that point as well.  It was extremely loud in there so this isn't a great place for a quiet, intimate conversation, but if you'd like to shout at someone for several hours one evening, Hemingway's is your place!

Something like, before 11am, 2-4pm, and after 9pm most things on the menu are 1/2 price.  The garlic-parm wings with a side of fries is what I usually get and it's always great.  I wash it down with whatever draft specials they have.  They offer amazing draft specials daily ($1.50-$2.00), Yuengling pitchers for $5.50, and as other Yelper's have said, very reasonably priced PITCHERS of shots with names like Tiger Woods, Lady Gaga, and Miley Cyrus.  It gets busy on the weekends and after 9 in general.

I was persuaded to go here one Friday (after the semester was over) for happy hour, and had a good time. I mean, yes, you can buy pitchers of shots here, but you can also get Sam Adams in the 16oz super nice Sam Adams glass for $7 and keep the glass. It's pretty big inside, wasn't crowded or smokey, and the food was not that bad for bar food. I had a chicken, bacon, avocado wrap, and it was tasty. Friends had burgers, and they cleaned their plates. Hemingway's, you went from hideous undergrad hangout in my mind to an establishment I would patronize!",

They have a good beer selection, but I don't like beer so I tried the pitcher of Fuzzy Navel. In this case, the drink was wayyy too sweet, but I can't complain too much since it was only $5. I liked the little gummy worm surprise at the bottom (though it probably contributed to making the drink even sweeter). I'd get it again if there were more people to share the pitcher with, since it's too sweet to just share among two people. We then decided to get something to counteract the sweetness and ended up taking shots of whiskey. Yup, a great idea... but that's another story.",

    "text": "If there is a bar that totally identifies with and even cherishes the fact it is a full blown college hang out, it is Hemingway's located at 3911 Forbes Avenue in Oakland. Its central location on the Pitt Campus draws a very young crowd looking to have a good time without traveling too far.  Though Hemingway's has some great specials (daily $1.75 beers, all day long) and a stellar beer selection, the set-up of this bar reduces its appeal. It is narrow to begin with and coupled with an awkward raised seating area spanning the middle complicates patron mobility. On a busy night it often takes five minutes to walk from the front to the back of the bar. Hemingway's has a pool table and dart board located in the back, but they are squeezed into a room entirely too small often making a game of billiards an unpleasant experience.  One aspect Hemingway's really has going for it is its staff. The same bartenders have been working here for as long as I can remember and they are good at what they do. Fast and efficient, even when the bar is at full capacity, they never short you on liquor in your mix drinks. Hemingway's also employs a number of wait staff to take food and drink orders and are a convenient option on packed nights.  The food here is not bad, and come between 9 and 11 and entrees are half off. Options from wraps, to burgers, to pasta dishes highlight the menu.  Don't expect anything great.  Just the normal cheap bar food.  The decor at Hemingway's is unique. Thousands of framed pictures of drunk college bar-goers cover every wall; a fitting choice for a college bar. It never gets old laughing at all the drunkards pictured here.  In conclusion, I think this bar is most suited for the newly turned 21 crowd. When you get a littler older, especially after graduation from college, the patronage here seems a bit juvenile. That being said, if you're looking for a cheap night out and some decent bar food for a great price then stop by Hemingway's.",

Deep fried provolone sticks tossed with buffalo sauce, topped with cheddar jack cheese and bacon. Served with a side of bleu cheese dressing. Talk about a heart attack waiting to happen.

The only problem is that every other person in Oakland is looking to do the same thing.  After 9:00 on pretty much any night of the week, you'll be fighting 100 other people for your spot on the floor, or at the bar, or for the bartender's attention.  That being said, if yo're looking to get drunk, you won't care and you'll love the $2.00 drafts (for anything, even Troegenator!) after 10.  Pitchers of shots are also a favorite (Miley Cyrus, while a girly name, will kill you with liquor).  The jukebox is playing pretty traditional party rap or metal, depending on who gets to it first.  The bartenders are generous and totally on top of their game.  It's really a spectacular level of service for such a busy bar.    The lunchtime crowd is a lot more chill, it's a great place to sip a beer and eat a good wrap or burger for cheap!
