The atmosphere of the restaurant was just so pleasant and a welcome departure from the Polish joint across the street. I think I am going to stop my elitist beliefs on Polish people. I think that I am most at home at a place like this. It was nice and quiet. Awesome decorations including some Thai General or some kind of military figure. There was a cartoon of a boy and girl with folded hands that appeared to be in love. I was giving up on the entire concept of pair bonding and love until I saw that adorable picture. The atmosphere of Thai Gourmet was so grounded and peaceful. A complete juxtaposition with that weird bar next door. I am glad that they didn't serve alcohol at this restaurant. I am really starting to get pissed off at alcohol and all the evil it encourages, creates and perpetuates. This place had so many cute special touches that made it a unique restaurant. That is what I love about supporting family owned and operated places and not chains. It made me think about the place across the street that was being filmed for Restaurant Impossible. All he does is come into a place that has created their own version of what their restaurant should be and destroys that vision. He changes it to what society as a whole deems as beautiful and acceptable. I think it should be the other way around. As it is in Thai Gourmet.",

I went with the 4 stars instead of the typical 5 because it didn't make my list of favorite Thai food.  I will be sure to check it out again and make sure my review still applies.

The first time, I had the Pad See Ew, and it was good... spice level was accurate, noodles and sauce were good.  Second time, I figured I cannot go wrong with what I ordered last time, so I got it again.   I could not have been more disappointed.  Just not consistent at all.   My hubby said his Pad Thai was not anywhere near as good as many other places as well.    Spring Rolls, or as they call them here, Summer Rolls are ginormous and quite scrumptious.  I wish everything else was as tasty.    Service was quick, no wait for a table, decent food makes this place okay, but I will be going to Nicky's and the Smiling Banana Leaf before I come back here.",

So...I ordered the Pad Thai.  It was okay, but nothing special.  I prefer my Pad Thai to have a rich peanut sauce and the sauce was pretty sparse on this one.  It did have plenty of sprouts, which is a plus for me though!  I also liked that the meal included soup (wonton or lemongrass) and an egg roll.  Love the extra perks!  Service was nice and quick with the total bill around $10 for everything, including the Jasmine tea I ordered.  I like a cheap meal, I just want a little more sauce!",

    "text": "I hang out in Bloomfield quite a bit, but I had never heard of this place until a friend mentioned it to me and I went searching for it. Turns out I had been walking by it for weeks without noticing since the exterior is pretty plain and you can't really look through the window with all the plants and neon signage in the way. Or perhaps I'm just too short to properly peer in, but I think it has more to do with the former. Regardless, the exterior and interior are nothing fancy.  Based on my friend's rave review of the restaurant, I had high expectations but ended up finding a lot to be lacking. First off, the waitress didn't ask anyone at our table for our desired spice levels. There was not even an offer of hot sauce or a spice rack to enhance our dishes, but then again, I didn't speak up and ask for one. I just found it strange considering we had ordered Pad Thai and curries. Secondly, the food wasn't as flavorful as I expected and the noodles in my Pad Thai were a little underdone.  The other odd thing about our experience was the vegetarian option. Or should I say options? They offer vegetables OR tofu. The waitress was very confused when my friends asked for both in their entrees. Luckily, after some explaining, my friends received half and half. It's not necessarily a negative, but we had just assumed offering these options together was the norm. But you know what happens when you assume...  Rather than be a Debbie-downer, I'll end with the positives of our experience. The food arrived at our table quickly. The portions are quite large and the prices are also slightly cheaper then other competing Thai restaurants nearby.",

    "text": "I'm not sure I have ever met a Thai dish I didn't like so perhaps I'm not the most unbiased reviewer here, but Thai Gourmet is one of those places that makes me salivate just thinking about it.  This small little joint gives a hole-in-the-wall impression from the outside, but inside everything feels very crisp and clean.  There is a little bit of an art explosion on the walls, but I consider it a plus to get to muse about the various scenes, random portraits, etc. while enjoying my meal.  Everything I have ordered from here has always been fresh and a HUGE plus in my book is that they are incredibly consistent with their spiciness levels.  I can handle heat but nothing too extreme and I usually order a \"6\" here, but my boyfriend sometimes convinces me to kick it up a notch to a \"7\".  Neither is overwhelming, but I can almost never finish my entire meal and have learned that the heat grows as the food sits and a \"7\" makes for some mouth-numbing leftovers.  My current favorite dish on their menu is the baby bok choy in garlic sauce with shrimp, but I really think you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  This particular dish is cooked to perfection... the bok choy leaves wilt just the right amount and soak up the sauce while the stem stays a bit \"al dente\" to create texture.  It is served with a healthy portion of shrimp and if memory serves me correctly fits the bill at around $10.  To be honest I have never paid attention to the price because 1) whatever they charged I would be willing to pay for it and 2) I'm always amazed at how little the total cost is when I have a full second portion to take home with me.  If you order takeout, they also include a delectable little brownie to go with each entree.  My ONLY gripe with them is that they sometimes go on extended vacations (like right now, for example... tried to go there last week and saw that they are closed until the end of August).  I know, everyone deserves a vacation.  But maybe they could give me some warning so I can order up a full freezer's worth of food before they go???",

I decided to walk over and check it out, and am glad I did. The place was pretty busy for a random Sunday evening, but the take out was made quickly, and was some of the best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. The peanut sauce with the summer rolls was everything I wanted it to be, my partner's prik noodles were awesome, and my red curry was fiery and delicious. This place will take your heat requests seriously - order a ten at your own (and your intestines') risk. We'll definitely return.",

I've tried nearly everything on the menu, and only found one dish that I didn't enjoy (a fish curry that I would probably enjoy now, as my palate has broadened).  When you're hungry, you can't beat their lunch specials, and the atmosphere is as real as it gets. This is a True family restaurant, run by good people.  Also, this is both a great place to have a group dinner, or to eat alone at the counter, as the service is both fast and unrushed at the same time.",

It's delish, it's super affordable, it's quiet (and you all know how I love quiet), and the staff are so wonderful. The BF and I have been going her for years. Why I haven't written a review is beyond me, but we went for dinner and I thought...I really have to share this place. The food is absolutely phenomenal, and I mean PHENOMENAL. I have never had anything here that didn't make me want to run in the kitchen and start licking the pots and pans. As a rule, I usually get the Pad Thai, because, well, it's Pad Thai, possibly the best dish on the planet. But I have tried other things here, and if you like different curries, this is place to get brave. The pumpkin curry is so out-of-this-world. Pumpkin Curry! Yeah. I never thought I'd say that about a pumpkin curry, but it's True! It's now one of my favorite dishes.  The stir fries -i.e. eggplant basil, basil leaves- are both awesome as well. We've tried almost all the apps and sometimes I dream about going and just ordering all the apps. Well, maybe two orders of fish cakes. Yeah, fish cakes! The old me would have never even tasted something called a fish cake, but here I am, salivating at the thought of them.  This place has truly changed my idea of what delicious is.",

The interior is small and sort of kitschy with the decor, and the service was very attentive and friendly.   We had an order of the fresh summer rolls with chicken to start. They weren't horrible, but there was too much iceberg lettuce and the chicken was dry, but the sauce made them passable. I got the red curry with pork and my friend got the fried rice with pork. My curry was thick and creamy but the pork was very dry. I loved it anyhow and would probably get it again with a different protein or stick with the veggie version. I was able to taste the fried rice and it was yummy, although heavy with sauce so I probably wouldn't order it for myself.   All in all I had a good experience and am definitely excited to try something different.",

My one friend, who was born and raised in Thailand told me that TG is the most authentic, best Thai in Pittsburgh; usually when I have THAT high of expectations t's usually not up to par BUT TG blew me out of the water. The food? Oh my goodness gracious... My friends and I ordered summer rolls as an appetizer, Pad Thai, another noodle dish, and panang Curry with a side of Tom Yum soup and fried spring roll. Let me ask you, how can EVERYTHING be SO EXCEPTIONAL? I was shocked of the deliciousness level of every single item.. I felt like a queen. My friends and I (who were all first TG timers) all agreed that this is the best Thai restaurant in Pgh AND the best Thai we've ever had. The staff was so kind and considerate. Prices were very fair, this place has me sold I'm a regular now!!",

The remainder varied from ok to awful. Guess you want to know about the awful? The red curry with chicken. When chicken tastes like it has been washed in detergent, one of two things has to be True... It has been washed in detergent ... or it has not, but just tastes like! Either way, that's not good. The sauce was watery, not creamy at all, the veggies (peas and carrots) were very likely taken from a frozen pack (pre-cut). A sorry sight. and the unpleasant taste in my mouth lasted for some time after we left the restaurant.  The pasta dish was better, but not terrific.   Oh, one noteworthy feature about the place: it seems to be a magnet for Pittsburgh's hipsters. For some, this will be a plus, others may be less into hipsters sighting...",

The service is great in the restaurant. Very quick and your water glass will never even get close to empty. The decor inside is a little eclectic, but that's part of the charm.

This is one of my favorite spots in East Pittsburgh.  Simple but great tasting thai food.  Cheap.  Great service (Let's not forget the underrated service of constantly filling up your water glass, some restaurants would be well served to be more attentive to their patrons beverage consumption habits). BYOB.  Great for groups, great for couples.  Always seemingly busy, but you can always get a seat.  It is my favorite place in Bloomfield (sorry Station).  You'll always have leftovers, which somehow taste better the next day.    The one measly complaint...the spice levels are pretty arbitrary.  A 3 is sometimes nothing, other times it will drop capsaicin all over your tastebuds to the point of submission.  Lesson learned, either go spicy all the way or not at all, you half-committed dope!  But it's almost endearing (\"Gee, i wonder how spicy a 5 will be this evening\").    Overall, this is a great place when you're not looking for quintessential asian food on a whim.  It's perfect.  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND: Garth Brooks.  Look...I know he's not high art, but when you're in the mood for fun without pretention, there is no substitute.  Garth can really hit the spot sometimes.",

The basil chicken is very flavorful and comes with white rice. It can easily be made into 2 meals and is very reasonable at ~$10. Their Kee Mao is also good.  When I'm in the mood, I'll get their spring rolls which aren't too heavy but still filling. Their chicken satay is a good 'healthier' option but not as flavorful or filling as one might like!  Ask for chili garlic sauce on the side if you want an extra kick. The staff is also very friendly and always greets you with a smile on their face.",

    "text": "We had some delicious take-out from Thai Gourmet last Saturday night.  We placed the order by phone, and then left almost immediately to pick it up.  The food was ready when we got there about 15 minutes later.  The prices were pretty good, and since you get such large portions, your money goes a long way.  The food was still hot when we got it home (yay!) so we immediately dug in.  First was our appetizer, the Hoi Jo - sort of a deep fried appetizer made of crabmeat, ground pork, and spices.  Sweet plum sauce accompanied it.  This appetizer was really tasty, a bit dry but the plum sauce really livened it up.  My boyfriend had the panang curry with chicken, which he really enjoyed.  I tasted it briefly and agreed it was very good, better quality than lots of other Thai we've had.  I got the Chiang Mai Me, which I'd never heard of but ended up being a great choice!  It was long egg noodles covered in a wonderful yellow curry sauce.  I got it with tofu, which was cut into long strips instead of cubes, and was also a little dry so I'd recommend maybe trying chicken or another meat instead.  Nonetheless, the curry sauce was excellent and abundant, and made glorious leftovers.    They also threw in fortune cookies AND these two super-moist brownies!  They were probably just made from a box mix, but still - it was awesome to have a surprise dessert.  I think we'd definitely order from here again.  It was above average, though not hugely so.  But our first impression was very good, and it's a very welcome change from all the Chinese food in our neighborhood.",

Ive tried a few different curries (red, green, panang) and some noodle dishes. Nothing disappoints!! I always have left overs for lunch the next day.  The girls that run this place really know what they are doing. I am eating a take out order right now and wrote this review solely due to the surprise homemade brownie they gave me with my chicken red curry.

I hate always bringing up the fact that I'm from the West Coast and I've had good ethnic food, but it's such a bummer when I try to eat out in Pittsburgh and I'm so disappointed.  Luckily it did not happen this time.    First off, the decor and ambiance were great.  The restaurant was clean, well-lit, non-pretentious and even had cloth napkins!  The menu was extensive and they had plenty of vegetarian options.  My friend and I ordered the tofu spring rolls as an appetizer.  They were very tasty and fresh.  For dinner we ordered a couple of curries and we weren't disappointed.  The sauces were creamy, slightly sweet, slightly spicy and totally delicious.  The portions are HUGE and we both ate way too much.  We had no complaints about the service either.  Overall, I would recommend this place to everyone...even my fellow West Coast emigrants.  Come here with an appetite because you'll need it!",

So I generally rate Thai restaurants on how does their dish they make compare to how I have had in Thailand and how I make it at home.   While the food at Thai Gourmet is edible, although greasy, my companion agreed that I could make better dishes than this. Now that does not constitute a put-down or I'm trying to say that the food sucked - it didn't it was good. (It's really hard to make Thai food poorly IMHO) However, as another poster said, they seem to know they have strong competition down the street where you get incredible food so they are trying to win on the portion size and value while the quality is not quite there.  Take the 3 star rating for what's it worth, the food is OK but there are much better places to go.",

It completely blows Thai Cuisine out of the water. My wife and I enjoy the noodle dishes there, they are a little more sweet and saucy. Here, they definitely get a good wok hei flavor into the dish and the noodles come out a little on the drier side. That is a mark of better cooking technique, but sometimes you want a little ghetto chinese food vibe to your food. The curries tend to be better here in my experience. The duck curry is particularly good. I don't like the rice they use. The rice turns out a bit mushy. I prefer calrose rice with everything. The calamari and the papaya salad are delicious as well. The serving sizes are pretty good, enough for 2 meals. Regarding service, I don't think you can beat the experience at smiling banana leaf, but they are very personable and this place feels more homey, like a family business.  tl;dr - everything is great except for the white rice",

    "text": "I stopped by a week ago for lunch with a friend.  We intended to stop by the new PB&J place down the street, but they're closed on Mondays, so we decided to stop by one of the two Thai restaurants on Liberty instead.  Given that the first one we passed was closed, and that this one was open, we decided to try it out.  Given that I'd never had one before, I decided to start off my meal with a Thai iced tea ($2).  If you enjoy Southern sweet tea, as I do, you'll probably enjoy the Thai version, which is topped with sweetened condensed milk.  This ended up being the best part of the meal for me, as I was underwhelmed by my order of pad kee mao (spicy basil/drunken noodles; $9).  As I've never had this dish before, it may be that I just ordered the wrong thing--I probably should have stuck to the pad Thai to be safe.  At any rate, I found the dish kind of flavorless and bland, and not to have much of a kick at all despite ordering a spice level of 4/10--I definitely wouldn't order it again.  I think this place is about middle of the road for PGH Thai cuisine.  To my palate, the quality of the food here is equivalent to Smiling Banana Leaf, but not as good as Spice Island or Nicky's, the latter of which remains my top choice for Thai cuisine in PGH.  While I wouldn't seek it out, it was good enough for lunch on a Mon. when a lot of other places are closed.  3.5 stars.",

Rather, it's for their rather arcane policy of not serving sit-in customers as early as half an hour before their posted closing time. We got there at exactly 9:30p, and though they officially close at 10p they weren't having us eat in. This wasn't the first time either; I've come here before on Friday nights at various times between 9:30 and 10 and was turned away each time. We were hoping that half an hour would have been enough, seeing as this is no dressy $$$ place, but we were sorely disappointed.  A last point--it would have been understandable if the kitchen had already closed, but we knew that not to be the case, as they still do takeout orders way past then. Having dined in multiple times before, we knew that the food takes at most 10 minutes to come out, and that half an hour, give or take 10 minutes, would have been completely sufficient for us to finish our meal from sitting down to paying the check.",

    "text": "When it comes to Thai food, I'm pretty boring. Nine times out of ten at a Thai restaurant, I'll order the same thing -- prik khing chicken. It's a fairly basic chicken with veggie dish, but the sauce is really what makes it sing. So I judge all Thai restaurants by how well they make this dish. And Thai Gourmet wins. The veggies are cooked to a crisp perfection, they are generous with the chicken, and the sauce is super flavorful and spicy without being too oily -- just how I like it.  Speaking of spicy, another reason that I like this place is that they aren't afraid to use a real 1-10 spicy scale instead of the \"wimpy person\" spicy scale. I've been to other Thai restaurants (I'm looking at you, Thai Place) where I'd order a 10 and it would barely tickle my tongue. Not so with Thai Gourmet! They mean business with their spice. I can handle my heat, and for me a 7 to 8 on their scale really gets the ol' sweat glands going. And I love that!  Lastly, the portions at this place are HUGE. A dinner order of the prik khing chicken (or pad thai or anything else there) is easily enough for two meals. And considering that the entrees are reasonably priced (around $10-13 bucks for dinner), I think this is a great value. Also, when you get your food to take out, they sometimes include a little dessert for free (brownie or tapioca pudding).  The only thing I don't like about this place is that you can't sub brown rice for white. This is one of the only Thai places I've been to that doesn't serve brown rice. So much for trying to add a little fiber to my meal. Ah well, still delicious and still 5 stars!",

For lunch they even give out free wontoon soup and egg roll. The sever is always friendly and offers extra rice for no extra charge.  Caution: The spicy level 10 is very hot! Its finally an Asian place where their spicy rating system is accurate.   Would recommend and go anytime I'm back in Pittsburgh. MUST TRY",

The food came out remarkably fast and was was really unbelievably good.  The portions are huge-we all took ours home and had it for lunch the next day.  We had tom yum soup, medium spice, pad tai, low spice and pork fried rice.  All were exceptional.  My daughter said that the pork fried rice was the best she's ever had.  The price is downright cheap for the amount of food you get.",

    "text": "My sister took me here since I was visiting her for her graduation. She said this is her go-to Thai restaurant!  Pros: This place is sooo good! I didn't expect much for Asian food in Pittsburgh, but this place really impressed me. We got the green curry chicken, red curry beef, basil chicken, basil fried rice, and pad kee mao. For the most part, everything was good! And cheap too! In my experience, Thai food is always about $11-15 per entree, and they don't give much. But Thai Gourmet's dishes are about $8-10, and they give you SO much!! I was really impressed. And this place is SPICY!! They ask you what spice level you want on a scale from 1-10, and we got 5 for most of our dishes. It is definitely spicy for a level 5! But my family loves spicy so it was a nice spicy. And the service was great because the waitresses were ON POINT with topping off our water! They're probably used to it since they're food is so spicy haha. I really liked the green curry chicken and the basil chicken.   Cons: It's kinda in a sketchy area, but at least there is close-by parking.   Overall: This place is great!! Cheap, big portions, and super tasty! I wish I had a Thai place like this where I live. Definitely check it out if you haven't!!",

I'm almost always disappointed, but yesterday, we had an excellent meal here! It's a very homely restaurant, family run by real Thai people. Our server was a very sweet woman.  We ordered the duck curry, green curry noodles, Thai fish cakes (finally, legit Thai fish cakes!) and Thai iced tea. Service was extremely prompt. Everything was out in 5 minutes! Oh and just to add, the portions were humongous! I swear once portion could feed two-three people (but this is not the basis for my 5 star review - I value quality and taste more than quantity). Both the curries were spice level 10, and tasted excellent! I especially liked the flavor of the duck curry. The fish cakes were as good as you get in Thailand.   This place trumps all the other Pittsburgh thai restaurants that are popular among the locals, and I really like the homey, family feel. Definitely will be back for more.",

    "text": "Now, I've only been to two different Thai places in Pittsburgh, the other being Nicki's. I did enjoy Nicki's slightly better, and I think they are a 4 or 5. So. Here we are.   Service was pretty on par. Water barely was ever empty, and the food came out in under ten minutes after ordering. Which was awesome but at the same time actually kind of startling. We both had curry, I assume they prepare a  bunch of it in the back and just finish it up and serve it. Not that that's a bad thing, I'm not a professional, and I don't know proper curry preparation practices. Lol. So maybe this is normal.   The flavor was pretty good; I'd say it was on the same level or a slight step lower compared to the other place I've been to. However, I did find the chicken to be pretty chewy which was a turn off, and my only real complaint.   The lunch curry came with a choice of lemongrass or wonton soup. I got the wonton, good choice, it was wholesome and savory. It also came with a small spring roll.   I will definitely come back here to try some different dishes!   Oh, shit almost forgot. The Thai tea was great!",

On my last visit, I ordered mo palo, sweet and savory braised pork short ribs, and nam prik, rice noodles served with fresh lettuce and carrots with a thick curry.  The mo palo dish reminds me of Hawaiian shoyu chicken. The sauce is brothy, probably made from a mixture of soy sauce, sugar and other herbs. It is served with cooked egg (ramen style) and is delightful over rice! This was one of the best dishes I have had here at Thai Gourmet.  The nam prik was also delicious. You get 4 neatly arranged rice noodles twisted into balls. The noodles are really well complimented by the fresh vegetables and curry with which it was served. This was a great dish!  Explore Thai Gourmet's menu and don't be afraid to try new items. You won't be disappointed!",

Another plus is that it's a byob place and from what I remember,  they don't charge you for the glasses. We also came here a couple of times for birthdays and they were nice enough to give us plates. Recently I have been doing takeout and realized that they give you free dessert . One time we got the tapioca with coconut milk and corn which I didn't think that I would like but I definitely do now after trying it! The only downside to this place is that it doesn't look as nice as other restaurants but it doesn't bother me since the other factors outweigh that.",

There is one young woman who is typically our server when we go and she is always very contentious and friendly.  I've tried the noodle dishes, fried rice, curries... all quality! My favorite is either the Thai Fried Rice with Shrimp or Pad Z-Ew, with a sweet brown sauce and thick rice noodles. Unless you are a competitive eater, you will have leftovers to take home since the portions are huge. I always have lunch for the next day (or a late night snack...)!  I stick to the non-spicy dishes, but if something says spicy, it will be spicy! I've tried bites of my boyfriend's Tom Yum soup or curry dish and my mouth was shortly on FIRE.   My only complaint is that the spice level is somewhat inconsistent. I am a huge baby when it comes to spice, so I usually do a 2-3 maximum. Sometimes it's fine, sometimes it's a little hotter than I would like. I should just stick with a one!",

I saw it got good reviews so we decide to give it a try as we are not dressed like we are going out. So we walked in and the host welcomed us warmly and seated us right way. We ordered pai kee mow(maybe known as drunken noodle)like I always do. I've never been to Thailand so I cannnt say if it is authentic or not but this is the first time I see tomato in this dish. The chicken has weird taste too. So basically all I m trying to say is everything is great but the tase was not to my like. I see this place get pretty busy during our meal, so maybe it is good tasty to others.  If you do come here, be aware of the size, it is huge! Everything look like two servings!!",

I haven't yet tried a curry quite this yummy. It was such a delicious combination of savory and sweet, but it was also very comforting and perfect for the cold winter day that I stopped in. As other reviewers have mentioned, the spice level at Thai Gourmet might be slightly higher than other Thai restaurants in town. I ordered a 4 spice level and it was quite spicy, yet it was still manageable for me. If you're not big on spice, I recommend ordering a level down from your usual.   I'm really looking forward to trying other dishes here. Not only was my food delicious, but the prices were very reasonable. Definitely will be back! Hopefully my schedule will permit me to visit again sooner rather than later!",

The food is a perfect comfort without sacrificing flavor, and I've never been disappointed in any order I've placed.  Sometimes people I know who don't like spicy will order something less spicy and it will come out very spicy, so be careful dealing with their 1-10 scale. This doesn't affect me because I don't care about spicy, but it is still something worth knowing.  Because I'm both a total sucker and also a white dude who grew up in the woods, while the Thai food here is incredible, the more Americanized comfort food is what I tend to go for. Crab Voluptuous, Wonton soup, and General Tso's chicken. If you're a vegetarian, you can get General Tso's tofu. If you're vegan, you can get Vegan General Tso's tofu. Or if you're not a sucker, their Thai food is delicious, too.",

However, I managed to stuff my face until my plate was empty and I am well known for leaving a plate pretty full! I ordered a 7...solid for anyone looking for as much heat as possible without overpowering the nuances of the dish. Nothing negative to say in the slightest. Perfect meal.",

We opted for lemongrass soup, summer rolls, a green curry and a panang curry. The summer rolls were excellent and the lemongrass was seasoned very well. I would like to see more veggies in it other than just a few mushrooms.  I ordered a 7/10 for my curry and it was by far one of the spiciest dishes I have ever eaten. And I love spicy food! I've had Thai HOT at other Thai restaurants and it wasn't as hot as my curry. WOW!  I had to pack up most to go because the spicy level was slowing me down. I ate the rest as a late dinner and again, nearly burned my mouth off. The staff was friendly and helpful and we were pleased by our experience. Prior to dining in, I had only ordered pickup multiple times. The portions match the price and I look forward to going back next time I'm in town.",

I recently had the green curry chicken with rice and the portions are huge! Even for lunch we all had left overs. I got a spice level of 5 and thought that was the right amount for a bit of heat but not too overpowering. The green curry was very flavorful and not too thick. My only complaint was the chicken was a little dry. I also am a fan of their thai spicy basil fried rice. Definitely recommend for lunch as you can't beat the price for the amount of food they give.",

We usually mix it up with what we get, but my absolute go to's are the Pad Kee Mow and the General Tso's Tofu (DON'T JUDGE ME!! I KNOW IT'S NOT ACTUAL THAI FOOD!!).  As a vegetarian, I've encountered less than inspired tofu dishes, but honestly, their Gen. Tso Tofu is amazeballs. No joke, I've ordered this for very, very non-vegetarian family members, and they scarfed it down thinking it was chicken. The food is always freshly made and high quality. It never tastes greasy or old. The curries all great and each definitely have a unique flavor. I'm pretty sure I've tried them all (except for the duck for vegetarian reasons), and I really love all of them, but the pumpkin is my slight favorite. It's family owned and operated, so you really need to go there and support them!  It's BYOB, delish and try the Yum Tofu salad!",

    "text": "Setting: 1:10 on a Tuesday afternoon. They close at 2:30pm and reopen later for dinner.   I got a lunch special with a friend, which consisted of Tom Yum soup and a spring roll. The soup was unexpectedly spicy, slightly more than maybe a teaspoon of Sriracha. Spring roll was okay.   They brought the lunch out within 5 minutes of bringing the appetizer out! But it was quite spicy to me (I got a 4 out of 10 on the spice scale). Of course, we're talking authentic Thai food. So it probably would have been more delicious to me if I was more spice oriented. I ordered the Chiang Mai Mee, which seemed to be coconut milk based, and much more sweet than I wished is was. This is how authentic Thai is made, apparently, so I suppose I'm more a fan of Americanized Thai.   My friend's experience was subpar. She ordered a few dishes for her colleagues from the office, which were made quickly. But one of the dishes was incorrect (noodle dish instead of the rice dish my friend ordered), and waitress asked if we could come back later (probably around the dinner time, since it was already 2:20) to pick up the correct dish. At this point, my friend asked if they could just remake the one they made incorrectly, to which the waitress replied, \"Hey, we make mistakes too.\" My friend didn't get the dish that she wanted, and she's not planning on returning.   Overall, an average place to eat, but the waitress's attitude was uncalled for. They absolutely should have remade that dish for free. If you want authentic Thai food (and have the stomach for the spiciness), then you might enjoy this place.",

Everything is super spicy (which I love), authentic, fresh, and scrumptious.   The servers at Thai Gourmet are really nice and  the food comes out quickly. The inside of the restaurant has lots of traditional Thai decor and succulents. It is a little small inside, but they have worked around that by remodeling the interior.   We started off our dinner with the summer rolls. You get your choice of tofu, chicken, or shrimp. My sister is vegetarian so we opted for tofu. They have lots of vegetarian/vegan options here. The summer rolls were amazing! The vegetables inside were crisp and the peanut dipping sauce paired nicely with the rolls.   For my main course, I opted for the Pad Kee Mao with shrimp. You get to pick your level of spice, so I opted for a 10. The spiciness does not disappoint here! The Pad Kee Mao was phenomenal. The noodles, the veggies, the shrimp, the spice, the portion- everything was perfect. My sister loved her Shrimp Pad Thai and said it was the best one she's ever had.   If you want to try Pittsburgh's greatest Thai food, definitely come to Thai Gourmet. I have a great experience every time I come here.",

Went 7 out of 10 spicy since the server told me that they're known for being spicy, but I definitely could have gone hotter.  Staff was very friendly.  Restaurant was nice, with a lot of people dining in and a lot of people ordering takeout.",

They are a BYOB so plan accordingly. The service was fantastic and everything came out very quick. We started with the spring rolls which were very good. I then had the Pad Thai which is usually what I get when I try a new Thai place (I'm pretty vanilla). Their's was probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh. They do spice from 1-10, their 8/10 definitely had more of a kick than other 8/10s. It's a good portion size. The prices are better than comparable places as well. Overall, great food and service, will definitely be back.",

    "text": "One sentence description of my experience just in case you don't read the full review: this place serves amazing food with delicious flavors and one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh.   We were here for Friday dinner after an exhausting week. The place seemed to be busy but fortunately, we were able to find a table for 2 people immediately. The wait staff is very friendly and nice. They gave us ample time to look at the menu and place our order. One thing to remember when you visit this place is, they follow the spice levels sincerely. So, please know your spice level before you place order here.   We ordered chicken satay, Pad thai, and pineapple curry. The portion sizes are generous, and the plate is well made and organized. I will start with the chicken satay. They are generous portions of 6 chicken served over 6 sticks with peanut chutney and other veggies on the side. The chicken is well marinated and packed with subtle flavors. It is so juicy that I liked it just by itself with any peanut chutney. However, adding the peanut chutney just added another layer of flavor which made it even better. I highly recommend this dish.   We ordered Pad thai with breaded tilapia and spice level of 6. Usually, the add-ons at many other places are less in quantity. However, they added generous amount of tilapia to the Pad thai. Just the noodles with fried egg and tamarind sauce flavor is delicious and adding tilapia to it just elevated the dish to another level. We had enough to bring it back home for a late dinner!   Last, but not the least, pineapple curry which is served with a good bowl of rice and a spice level of 5. The dish looked so colorful and again generous quantity with a good number of pineapple chunks. I loved the soupy part of the dish which consisted of coconut flavor mixed with a bunch of other spices. Good quantity for one person if they are extremely hungry, but there will enough for a left over if you are someone with a small appetite.   Overall, great experience and great food with flavors that are on-spot. I highly recommend this place and it is good to dine alone, to go on a date, or to hang out with a bunch of friends. Also, they have take out which is also very popular.",

Although I really love the mom and pop vibe of this restaurant, I think they use a little too much sugar in a lot of their dishes. I am a huge fan of Tom kha and use it as a standard by which to compare Thai restaurants but unfortunately the tom kha here tastes overwhelmingly of sugar. It could definitely benefit from more fish sauce and lime juice.  The other complaint is that the prices are a bit steep for the area. Dinner for two is around $50 for an app and two entrees but youd have to bring your own beer. Still, I think Thai Gourmet is a good place to have around during times when Nicky's isn't open but it is a pretty average restaurant for me.",

    "text": "\"Authentic Thai food with probably the BEST lunch deal\"  Thai Gourmet's lunch special is really bang for your bucks! Seriously, this might be the best Thai lunch deal in Pittsburgh.  You get to pick from 27 different entrees, add meat or vegetables, and choose the spiciness. This comes with either Tom Yum Soup or Wonton soup. Also the best part is that this will most likely come under $10! Also, Their portions are pretty decent and I was very full by the end of the meal.   I ordered the Pad thai with pork in spiciness level 7. I love and can handle spicy food (Korean, Thai food are my fav), so I choose 7 and it was perfect. My friend ordered a 5, and we could barely taste the spiciness, so if you like spicy food I recommend choosing 7 or above.   There wasn't any line and the place didn't seem too busy even during lunch hour. But this place isn't too big doesn't have too many tables.",

(a spicier, more delicious version of duck sauce). i've never bothered with the wonton, because the lemongrass soup is flavorful with a definite kick to it.  if you're not too adventurous with thai food, the general tso is pretty delicious, but you might as well try something new. the curries are always spiced how you want them, unlike the lemongrass cafe's downtown, and their noodle dishes are awesome. my personal favorite is the pad kee mow. whoever decided to cook with lemongrass is a total genius.  at dinnertime, the green papaya  salad is delicious. shredded green papaya, chunks of shrimp, and a peanut sambal sauce. the appetizer sampler platter is great for sharing. hopefully, you'll still have room for the main course.  the service is friendly, casual, and all family as far as i can tell, unlike thai cuisine up the street. the decor is fresh, cute, and a little bit campy though sometimes there's a musak soundtrack on featuring simplified james blunt and celine dion. strange as that may sound, it enhances the experience.",

The space was a bit tight but the staff with friendly even though we were kinda in their way the whole night.   I am a sucker for green curry.  Its normally the only thing I ever get at thai restaurants.  I am by no means a thai expert but possibly a green curry expert.  I am like bummed because I am 99.9% sure I order shrimp but I got chicken and was too hungry to care.  It was delish tho! I also like that I can talk myself into the dish being mildly healthy because I can get brown rice. ha.   Pros: Affordable. BYOB. Friendly service. Great flavors.   Cons: Parking can be a pain.  The restaurant is tight. Got the wrong food- kinda, but it was still good. haha.   Overall:  I will be back!",

    "text": "I must agree with Monique and say that for this review I wish we could give half stars- because this place would be a 3.5 for me. Alas, that's not how the game works, so I have to fall on the side of 3 rather than 4. The primary reason for the 3 star is simply because I've had better Thai food in Pittsburgh. Second, I (like others have said) have hardly tasted Thai food I haven't liked, so I control my Thai food bias by using the metric of comparison to other Thai joints. Nonetheless, this is a nice place to sit and enjoy some well made food in a place that has a bunch of character. I've eaten here many times with friends, and I definitely prefer this place over Thai Cuisine right down the street. These guys do a mean curry, and the staff have always been very friendly to me. I'd recommend that people stop in if they're in the area and looking for good Thai.",

I'm a sizeable guy, so it didn't quite fill me up, but I took the leftover curry sauce home and there was enough for a good two more bowls of rice. We also split an appetizer platter. The peanut sauce was amazing. Seriously, this was possibly the best meal I've had in Pittsburgh. For the price, the quality and amount of food was an incredible value. The staff were quiet, but friendly. Food was served in a very timely fashion. Seriously, I would return here over Smiling Banana Leaf or Pusadee's Garden any day.",

    "text": "Definitely a front runner for best Thai in my book. Of course I got the Pumpkin Tofu Curry. If you have read any of my other reviews  you may notice that's all I get at Thai restaurants. It's not because I'm afraid to try anything else - it's that it is SO good to me that I would regret not getting it ever. But I have a little thing going here - maybe someday I will be the Pumpkin Tofu Curry expert.  Anyway, this was my 3rd time eating here. The first time we got takeout and were so pleased with everything. The second time we ate-in and had a great experience as well, so we went back 5 days later. (OK, we might be addicts.) Last night when we went we both got the Fresh tofu spring rolls to start and each got the pumpkin curry. The spring rolls were large, fresh and delicious. The dipping sauce was perfection. I ordered tofu as usual, Forest ordered chicken. We both stepped up the spice level to a 7. It was perfect. The tofu here is the best I've had: generous portions, great texture. The pumpkin was perfect and they also add carrots, peas and peppers to the mix. The spice level was good for me - a little heat, but not overwhelming.  The staff is awesome - super sweet and friendly. They replenish rice as soon as it looks like your getting low, and service is really fast. I love this place. It is my current fave. My only beef is that they don't have brown rice as an option - but honestly it doesn't matter because they're that good.",

    "text": "Thai Gourmet's food is just 'pretty good,' but I keep going back because I like the meal experience there; it's the only Thai place I know of where you can eat at a counter and they keep Christmas lights in the windows all year.   Because it's in a narrow row house and decorated like your great aunt's living room (assuming she's the kind of woman who loves wood paneling and house plants), the ambiance is unpretentious in the best way possible.   Standard Thai dishes like pad thai, green curry, larb and pad kee mow are solid, but other classics that should be equally solid, such as salad rolls, tom kha gai soup and panang curry always leave me wanting more spice, depth and--I hate to trot out the most cliched foodie term ever, but--complexity of flavor.   Thai ice tea, contrary to popular belief, can be done wrong if it's wwwaaaayyyyy too bitter or wwwaaaayyyyy too sweet, but these guys whip it up good.  I also like to play menu adventures here: this is the game where I ask the server (one of the owner's daughters) what's good and then pick whatever sounds most crazy. It's been awesome at helping be break out of my Thai food rut, which previously consisted exclusively of fish cakes, papaya salad and panang curry.",

The atmosphere is eclectic and the crowds are casual.  The staff is personable, cheerful and smiling.  They are willing to make suggestions as well as modify a dish to your liking.  The spice scale goes from non-existent at 0 to a scorching 10. The food is fresh, individually made, service is quick and server attentiveness is just right.   Water is always filled, extra rice is not a problem and I have seen many of the same customers in there for years now.   The Todd munn is a favorite; crisp and hot patties of whitefish, chili and green bean fried to perfection. Fresh rolls are fresh egg roll wrappers filled with rice, basil, carrot, and your choice of shrimp or tofu...both worth trying with the wonderful dipping sauce. The array of curries is excellent, especially the Mussuman. The noodle dishes are great with your choice of meat or sea food.   If you can't find something to enjoy at Thai Gourmet, then you really do not like Thai food.",

It's at least a dollar cheaper for the Pineapple fried rice with chicken here than anywhere else I've ordered it, and the spice levels actually have a kick to them. Fried rice is my go-to fat girl order when I'm treating myself, but the veggies and grilled chicken they make look incredible as well. The spring rolls are also some of the best I've had, simply because the sauce with them has this tang and kick that's missing in the sauce from other standard Thai places. I may even try the noodle dishes here sometime instead of trekking to Shadyside for my beloved Noodlehead. Since Noodlehead is a completely different style of Thai place nothing could replace it in my mind, however I love how quick and convenient Thai Gourmet is. It's not much of a sit-down restaurant, but the service has been great whenever I've picked up and I'm sure I'd like it fine if I ever ate-in.",

Cashew Nuts chicken ($8.95): chicken, onions, carrots, bell peppers, water chestnuts, snow peas, and roasted chili paste.  This is more of a Chinese dish.  It's delicious nonetheless.   Red curry ($8.95): roasted duck, tomatoes, bell peppers, basil leaves and pineapple in a coconut curry sauce.  Very delicious curry that goes great with rice.    Basil Leaves Chicken ($8.95): chicken, onions, bell peppers, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, garlic & chili.  Outstanding blend of spices with vegetables and chicken.    Be sure to pay for parking!

If you order a 10, damn sure it will be a TEN. The lunch special is the best deal in the city. For around $7, you will get a spring roll, amazing lemongrass or wonton soup, plus your invariably gigantic entree. I have actually taken leftovers from lunch, which I honestly don't think has ever happened before. The Nam Prik is my favorite: a bowl of saucy, spicy, peanutty (?) chicken, with noodles, tempura vegetables, and lettuce on the side. The basil chicken, pad see ew, and prik king are not to be missed. Even the General Tso is wonderfully unique. Plus, your food comes really quickly, which I appreciate at lunch.",

    "text": "Thai Gourmet is a bomb spot for lunch. $6 and some change gets you a spring roll, cup of soup and an entree large enough to fill your gut three times over (note, no lunch deal on weekends). I always skip the soup (I think it's disgusting). When you do that, they give you two spring rolls (yes!). The spring rolls are usually cold and relatively hollow, but I kind-of love them anyway. The Nam Prik is my favorite entree choice, though it is among the least healthy of things I am willing to eat in this world. Greasy tempura and loads of delicious tofu served with an ultra rich spicy peanutty sauce and a sad pale side salad. The portion size is seriously gigantic. Other decent entree choices I've tried include Japanese Eggplant and the Pad Kee Mao. I usually leave here feeling like I am going to explode, with leftovers enough to revive that sensation two more times.  They *seem to be fully understanding of the vegan concept when I ask for no egg and no fish sauce.   For dinner, or on a Saturday, you pay more money for less food, meh.   Spice level of 10 is not as scary as it should be.",

    "text": "As far as I am concerned, this is the best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  Inexpensive and good friendly service.  The family that owns this restaurant are really some of the nicest people you will ever meet.  More often than not, they will add a free desert or small treat to my take out order.  I love spice food, and when I ask for a level 8 of spiciness, I get level 8.  At most other Thai restaurants, I get a 4 no matter what I ask for.  If you like spicy food too, then I'm sure you will appreciate that.   If you dine there, I admit that the atmosphere is nothing to write home about.  I'd describe it as a hole in the wall, but in a good way.  Not fancy or pretentious by any means. Then again, at this price point, you really shouldn't expect too much.",

Atmosphere has a little to be desired and though my daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, it was a bit depressing to be the only ones in there on a Saturday night during Parents Weekend at 8:15!  Summer rolls were tasty and fresh and one order was perfect for 2 ppl. (1 each as app).  Had the basil duck as my entree and it was amazing.  The duck was tender and perfectly cooked and the level 3 spice was just enough heat.  Price was just right too.  Wish I'd checked to see that it is BYOB :(",

    "text": "Thai gourmet was the first place I ate the day I moved to Pittsburgh. Delightful, awesome currys. I have a thai problem, wherein I eat thai at least once a week. This place assists with my addiction. I am a thai addict and I am not ashamed to admit it. Thai gourmet is within walking distance to my house and this place is seriously a frequent stop in my week. I think this place is like a step above thai cuisine, certainly there is something aesthetically more appealing about the interior that is a step above TC. This place is a bit further for me to walk, but I am willing, because the food and ambience are great.  I'm a bit panang fan here. I pretty exclusively eat currys at thai places. and TG is awesome. they also carry crab rangoon which I'm a sucker for also.",

This place is small and somewhat unkempt, so we go there for there for the food not the atmosphere.  The Japanese eggplant stir fry with either duck or tofu is my favorite, but everything I have tasted is fine.  BYOB",

I strongly recommend the Thai Style Fried Rice.  The yellow curry and cashew tofu were also very tasty.  I normally don't review places that have over 20 reviews but I figured I had to give a shout out to the vegans / vegetarians.  The tofu is really tasty and if you order the fried rice with tofu they automatically leave out the egg.  Lots of other options available for vegans.    The parking is street only.  Credit Cards are accepted.  Good place to bring a date or a group of friends for a casual yet tasty meal.",
