    "text": "I'll admit it, I'm a Thai food snob. I partially credit it to the time I spent working at an authentic Vietnamese & Thai restaurant. That experience definitely kicked off my Thai food obsession and now I'm on a venture to find the best Thai in every city I visit.   I am celebrating a decade in Pittsburgh this year. I can say without a doubt that Nicky's Thai is THE best Thai food in da 'Burgh. Both locations (downtown and north shore) offer high quality, flavorful food and beautiful decor. Neither location is terribly spacious but they do their best to accomodate large groups. My friends and I have squeezed in a table for 12 at the downtown location!    The service has greatly improved since opening Downtown. It was a little rough in the beginning but I let that slide. I've never had an issue with the North Shore location. I also order Nicky's to go fairly often and they've never missed a beat with the flavor, portion size or estimated time of pick up.   Let me break down my go to dishes at Nicky's (and almost any Thai restaurant)  Appetizer: Thai summer rolls. These are cold, rice paper wrapped spring rolls and the filling varies slightly depending on the restaurant. Nicky's are served with a peanut dipping sauce and they are fantastic. Fresh and bursting with mint! A+ Entree: Thai curry. I usually go for green but sometimes branch out and try mussuman. I've had both at Nicky's and I was not disappointed. They know how to make a mean curry. Served with either white or brown rice and plenty to take home as leftovers!   Fair warning to all Thai food enthusiasts: Nicky's doesn't mess around with their spice level. If you order an 8/10, it is not weak. I LOVE spicy food and I've never ordered a 10. 8 has always satisfied my palate.   I rarely get dessert because I don't have much of a sweet tooth (plus, it's tough to save room for it with the delicious app & entree!) But, if I go for it, I get black sticky rice with mango. It's a filling dish but well worth it. The sticky rice is made with sweet coconut milk and the mango is fresh cut!   Go to Nicky's Thai. Your tastebuds will thank you.",

    "text": "A friend treated me to Nicky's Thai for my birthday earlier this fall. We had a reservation and were seated immediately; the service was great considering how busy they were. The food lived up to its reputation, and I especially enjoyed the unique and fun brass serving pots they used for my curry. The portions are very generous -- I think I got about three meals out of the dinner I ordered.   The only drawback for us was the noise and closeness of the tables. I realize that space is at a premium downtown, but our table was literally a foot away from the others around us, and the background noise eliminated the option of conversation. We did go on a Friday night, so I would assume that this is not always the case. I would definitely return, but probably for lunch rather than dinner.",

Instead, I think it is when a restaurant does everything right, like Nicky's.  Duck perfectly cooked and seasoned, service wonderful, spring roles well flavoured and perfectly presented, Thai iced tea full of tasty goodness, and prices rock-bottom in the middle of the city.  Lovely ambiance - an oasis of calm in the heart of downtown.  I count myself lucky to have visited.",

The Veggies 4 You appetizer is huge and delicious. I'd get the spring rolls on their own as a lunch bc they're that good! The pad Thai is flavorful- I'd recommend getting at least a 3 as spice level (though be warned that last time, I got a 5 and almost cried...but kept eating bc it was so good). The massaman curry was delightful- a wonderful peanutty, coconutty dish.   Looking forward to our next visit here!",

The atmosphere is great and the staff are welcoming and friendly.  I've truly never had anything bad to eat here.  Last night I met a friend for dinner and treated myself to a glass of their gewurztraminer (Chateau De Michelle - a favorite) which was a great deal (and a generous pour) for $5.  They do have a full bar at this location but you can still bring your own bottle of wine if you'd like.  Their corkage fee is $10.  At the recommendation of another friend I ordered their pineapple fried rice with chicken and kept the spiciness to a level 4.  It was wonderful!!  Next time (and there will be a next time for this dish) I'm going to bump it up to a 6 or 7.    You can't go wrong with Nicky's if you're in the mood for delicious Thai downtown.  I would highly recommend it and it's great (and very convenient) if you're heading to a show at the Benedum or Heinz Hall!",

Also, it was served in this really unique brass urn- looking thing... which was cool and impressed me.  I'm a wimp and can't do super spicy, and they accommodated that easily. My date had the spicy basil fried rice, which was good, yet too hot for this girl. He loved it though. The atmosphere was comfortable, employees nice, definitely recommend.",

I get so frustrated with Americanized Thai cuisine but this is as close to authentic as you're going to get here in the burgh. Their spice scale is legit. My husband ordered his pad Thai at a level 10 and I thoroughly enjoyed watching him sweat it out!   We started our meal with some Thai iced teas and an order of their crispy tofu peanut. The teas weren't overly sweet and were a nice offset to the spicy food. The crispy tofu was light but full of flavor with the peanut sauce.   Both of our meals came with the soup of the day, which happened to be their chicken and rice. I have to say I wasn't at all disappointed. Slight hint of lemongrass was a welcome surprise to what normally would be a bland soup.   We both ordered the pad Thai. Mine was a level 3 shrimp, his was a level 10 beef. No complaints on either end. The serving was quite large for lunch.   All in all I would highly recommend and will definitely be back!",

The flavors were good overall, but the dishes were incredibly salty. My friend and I had to split the rice bowl and neither of us could fully appreciate meal because of the salt load (think numb on your tongue). I had asked the waitress before I ordered if they could make the pad tai less salty, and she told me they did not add salt so the only thing they could do was completely take out the fish sauce. I did not want an entire ingredient left out, so I just left it as is. Gave the place two tries, will probably not be back.",

    "text": "This place is pretty darn good Thai food at more than reasonable prices for downtown dining.  While the decor and ambience is a little \"over the top\" and quite possibly too much gold and elephants, the meal itself is just what you'd be looking for in a Thai place.  Ample portions and good eats in a vibrant atmosphere, make this place a solid stop for anyone's \"Thai fix\" for food.  One caution would be not to mess around with the spiciness of your dish, as if you choose the path of spice, be prepared for its wrath!  If you like \"a good kick\" then a 5 in the hot scale is probably your best bet.  If you're feeling adventurous, then you might want to turn up the dial towards 7...and if you downright want to ruin your meal and take on something way too hot, then 10 it is.  Either way, Nicky's can deliver what you want!  At the end of the day, this place serves quality food that leaves you full...which makes it a winner in my opinion.  Just watch out for the shiny, gold elephants...they don't bite, but they may try to steal a bite of your food.  Enjoy!",

I've had the tofu Pad Thai and then wanted to try a thicker noodle and found the Tofu Pad See Ew with extra vegetables was everything I could've hoped for from a Thai restaurant. The dark soy sauce is the perfect balance of flavors and the tofu cooked to perfection.  I enjoy mine extra firm and not many places serve it as such but Nicky's does, and it's something so delicious that the thought is actually even making me salivate while writing this. I've had take out more than dining inside however both my experiences were rather nice. The restaurant seems a bit crammed but quaint. Wish I could give this place 5 stars but the prices are a bit steep I end up paying more because I like veggies in my tofu Pad See Ew, not just 5 pieces of broccoli.",

It's pretty rare I eat at the same place twice on such a short trip, so that's all you really need to know.   Both times Nikki's accommodated our oversized groups with ease. Service was efficient. Checks were split perfectly. Food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.  Nikki's lets your order your dish spicy on a scale of 1-10 or 20 (Thai Spicy). My group was all over that range. A few people ordered a Pad Thai = 1. One brave soul ordered her curry at 20. Everyone was happy with what they received.   Definitely was on the best places to eat in downtown Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Since returning from my trip to Thailand, I like to think I've developed a more discerning taste for Thai food.  Nicky's Thai had been on my list for awhile and was the first place my boyfriend and I decided to try upon returning from our trip.  We walked in without a reservation and had no trouble being seated right away.  The place is completely packed with decorations that look like they came straight from a Thai marketplace...buddhas, apsara dancers, elephants, and peacocks in gleaming gold nearly everywhere you look.  It's a beautiful and authentic space that really sets the mood for the delicious Thai food you are about the consume.  I decided to go with one of the Chef Specials, the Salmon Mango Curry.  Probably not the most authentic dish, but I was still a little burned out on Thai food (the boyfriend was not).  It was a nice-sized piece of grilled salmon smothered with veggies and mango and topped with a green curry sauce.  The amount of mango was a little overwhelming, which made for a very sweet dish.  I enjoyed it nonetheless but would probably choose a curry dish next time.  My boyfriend went with the Massaman Curry with Tofu.  It was full of chunks of fried tofu, potato, and pineapple and topped with peanuts.  Very rich and flavorful!  I also loved that the curry and rice came served in big fancy golden dishes.  The portions were huge, we easily had enough left over for two lunches the next day. I was still a little burned out on Thai desserts, but I look forward to trying their Mango with Sticky Rice and Deep Fried Bananas with Ice Cream in the future.  This is a great little piece of Thailand in downtown Pittsburgh, and I can't wait to bring my friends and family in to experience the exotic cuisine!",

    "text": "I absolutely love Nicky's Thai Kitchen. It is simply the best Thai in the city, and also the best service. I have been to both the North Side and the Downtown locations frequently, and they are always offer delicious food in a fun and casual atmosphere.   The North Side location is typically where we end up, since it is easier to get to if we are just headed out for dinner. In the winter the inside area is cosy and warm, and in the summer the outdoor patio is beautiful, with a unique ambiance not usually found in the city. I even like it better than the outdoor garden at Pusadee's in Lawrenceville. We recently ate here on a Friday night, and it was bustling! We had reserved a table outside and arrived a bit early, so were on hand to watch the waiters and waitresses perform their serving magic, always hurrying around but never bumping in to each other. When we made it to our table, it was back in the corner of the space, which was full of patrons enjoying food and wine (BYOB, with corkage fee of $5. It is $10 at the downtown location, since they have a bar). We had brought a bottle ourselves, and settled in for a lovely meal. Our server was kind and patient, and explained to us the new options on the menu. We stuck with our usual appetizer of the fresh spring rolls, which are always delicious and served with a tasty peanut sauce. I ordered the green curry, which was perfectly spicy and full of vegetables. My husband tried something new, a chicken and shrimp dish with red curry. He enjoyed it, but wished that the North Side location offered the duck dish that he enjoys so much when we eat downtown.   Nicky's will always have a special place in my heart, because my husband took me to the downtown location before proposing to me on the Roberto Clemente Bridge. But, I will keep coming back for the amazing food and wonderful service!",

I lived in California which is the land of excellent food. So I have a lot of experience with Thai restaurants and this one is top notch. The crab rangoon was gourmet quality as were the fresh rolls. The Tom Kha Gai was good, but I've had better... much better actually, but different folks have different ideas of what a coconut soup like this should be, so it was the chef's idea of good and homey no doubt. The curried fried rice was good albeit a tad bland. They chop their veggies up pretty roughly and it affects the flavoring. But all in all it was an excellent experience and I'll definitely go back. By the way, it was the first time in my entire life that I ate Thai food in Pittsburgh. Ha! It simply didn't exist when I lived here before. The wonders of this modern era.",

    "text": "After reading a number of positive online reviews of the original Nicky's location, I had somewhat high hopes about this newer location (despite several disappointing visits to other Thai restaurants in this area already). Unfortunately, both the food and the experience fell short of that expectation.  Perhaps it was because we visited at an especially busy time (i.e. the weekend pre-show dinner hour), but we were given a table after a relatively long wait - under the condition that we free up the table within an hour. Really? I've never heard that before. Ever. Maybe that's a more common practice in restaurant culture than my personal experience shows, but it truly baffles me that efficient \"table-turning\" is predicated on customers watching the clock during their meal rather than a prompt/competent wait staff. Isn't giving guests a relaxing, enjoyable experience the whole essence of a restaurant? Maybe I'm asking for too much here.  As for the food itself, the Pad Thai was overly sweet, which only became more and more prominent with each successive bite. One of the friends I was with said her curry left much to be desired as well. Also, pro tip: providing more thorough lists of each dish's primary ingredients on the menu can ensure that fewer things get sent back to the kitchen due to food sensitivities/allergies.  It's a shame, really; this is a great location with a ton of potential, but location and convenience alone can't save lackluster food or service. Well, at least the decor was nice, right?",

It takes a very high level of understanding of spices and flavors to balance heat with savory, and I don't think the kitchen staff is experienced enough YET with cooking with tofu to the same amazing level they are with meat dishes.   Will definitely be eating here again when I visit!",

A mixed veggie app platter, a few desserts to split, a couple drinks. The banana dessert was a bit rough on the wrap, once deep fried, but still nice. Overall, some of the best curry I've had anywhere. The heat gauge seemed to be right on, the service was impeccable, and it's a lovely atmosphere. We'll be back on our next trip to Pittsburgh. Oh, the total for five at dinner was $110, a great price.",

    "text": "I made a yelp account specifically to make this review, and I'm sad to say this is something I've been thinking about since my last terrible meal at Nicky's a few months ago. The last time I was there, I had amazing service, but the worst tofu I've ever had in my entire life. My food came out ice cold and when I asked for them to reheat it, it was brought back out piping hot after about 30 seconds and disgustingly hard, having obviously just been microwaved. Tonight, I went for dinner with my boyfriend, on a crowded Tuesday night. After waiting about 20 minutes to hear from a server, we asked for our bottle of wine to be open (new TEN DOLLAR corkage fee). My boyfriend ordered the chili mango tofu and I asked for the tofu noodle soup.  I asked that the tofu be fried, because the menu specifically says \"fried tofu\" and last time I ordered it, it wasn't. The waitress immediately said no it couldn't be fried because they were \"busy\". I tried asking again nicely and she continued to tell me how they couldn't make the tofu fried because they were \"busy right now\" and didn't have time. After this ridiculous encounter, we continued to have terrible service throughout the entire meal as the waitress hurried us out of the restaurant. Not only did she give us our check immediately after we finished eating, but then she came back to check and see if we had put our card in about 4 times before we actually were ready.  I used to love this restaurant in the north side and was ecstatic when they opened a location on Penn because I live downtown. I have tried to give them the benefit of the doubt multiple times and to rationalize terrible experiences here. After tonight's meal, I would not recommend Nicky's to anyone, and will not be coming back here.",

    "text": "After hearing all about Nicky's Thai Kitchen on the North Side, I had to try the new location downtown since it's close to my work. The restaurant is on the corner of Penn Ave. and 9th, which is close to a few garages if you need a place to park.  Apparently everyone else wants to head to Nicky's Thai for lunch as well, as it was packed when I went today around 11:45 am. If you plan on visiting during your lunch break, make sure you have a full hour - you'll probably need it.  The decor of the restaurant was very pretty with all of the gold statues and such, but the walls are dark, and the lights are pretty dim, so it isn't too bright inside. Additionally, it can be a little difficult to maneuver around the restaurant as it is filled with 4-person tables (I didn't see any 2-person ones).   The service was mediocre. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that this is the first week of opening.  I waited longer than expected to get my hot tea, but my food came out in a timely manner. Everyone was friendly as well.   I ordered the panang curry with chicken for lunch, which came with a side of the daily soup or salad. I went with the soup, which turned out to be a rice soup for the day. It was spiced wonderfully and was loaded with rice. Maybe it was just because I had high expectations for the curry, but I wasn't too impressed with it. The curry wasn't really loaded with many vegetables, just a few pepper and broccoli here and there; however, the lunch portion was a perfect size for lunch.   My love for Thai food is too much to not come back. They have a decent sized lunch menu, which means that there are so many more items for me to try! Nicky's also does takeout, so that may be an option when I don't have the time to sit for the whole hour.",

I happened upon Nicky's Thai Kitchen when I was in town for a business conference. I was craving some Thai food and luck would have it, there was a restaurant a few blocks from my hotel. I have to say that I was not disappointed with my decision to try Nicky's. The service was great. Even though we had dropped in during their lunch rush, we got a table quickly, the wait staff was very attentive, and the service was still extremely fast despite how busy they were. The food was amazing and the portions were huge. The owner of the restaurant made a point to visit with every table to check in on each customer and they even gave us a few Thai donuts for free. Overall, I'd say that Nicky's has fast service, amazing, authentic Thai food, large portions, and cheap prices. This is definitely a place to try if ever in Downtown Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Our owners went here with some friends on a lovely Saturday afternoon. Mom almost  invariably gets chicken pad thai at thai restaurants around the city, so her opinion serves as a great barometer for us cats. Dad like to try new things, but also appreciates the standard thai curries. They had been to the North Side location many times, always touting its glories to fellow thai-lovers. Dad got the black chicken, intrigued by the rum sauce and ginger. Dad should have known his own tastes better, as perhaps the strong ginger taste did not suit him. He does not blame anyone but himself...Mom liked her pad thai. Our owners' vegetarian friends ordered vegetarian things, but one dish came out with chicken (often not eaten by vegetarians, but loved by us cats). Our owners' friend was a very flexible vegetarian, as he was ok with eating it anyway. I am sure many vegetarians/vegans would not be as cool about it. The lovely ambiance of the cozy North Side location felt a tiny bit cramped in the downtown location. Our owners decided that they perhaps would choose other Thai restaurants as favorite in the city (Smiling Banana Leaf, we're looking at you), but that Nicky's has always been an excellent choice as well. Thanks! Meow.",

That stuff is so good, I could just eat that, and call it a night. Daughter loves it so much, I've seriously considered using it as a bribe. Hey, don't  judge me until you've had it, or need to motivate the kiddoes to clean their room, etc.  Tonight I ordered the Mint Grilled Beef Salad. Totally forgot with the delicate mint, that ordering it a \"7\" on a 1-10 spiciness scale would be a mistake. I took a couple bites, and ordered Jasmine Coconut Rice to help counteract the spice. I also sipped my Thai Green Ice Tea, which is sweet. Think of it as the Thai version of a dessert wine, but ice tea instead. Like an apertif.  The rice did the trick. This isn't the first time I've ordered that rice to pull the spiciness down, and it perfectly complements many dishes.  Guess what's for breakfast (I took a huge portion home)? The portion is so big, If always take about 80% home. It's great with marinated beef or pork, or grilled chicken. Might even be good with salmon or steelhead trout.  The server, a young, petite Asian female whose name I didn't understand,  was very nice, helpful and efficient. Very attentive,  without being intrusive.  I love it that though I was dining alone, the hostess didn't seat me in the worst possible seat. Rather, she asked if I preferred a table along the wall, and I said no; the table in the middle of the restaurant was fine.",

The tables and chairs were so close together, we could not leave without bumping into someone or something.   We ordered a chef specialty that doesn't appear on the online menu, but it had chicken, shrimp, and crabmeat in a peanut sauce with broccoli and green beans. When I tried cutting into the chicken and didn't make any progress, I knew it was going to be bad! After a few minutes of some heavy sawing, I was able to cut a piece of chicken. At that point, I didn't really want to eat it but felt committed to at least trying it. What a mistake! I couldn't swallow it since it was disgusting- tough and no flavor - so I (discreetly)spit it out. I decided to try another piece of \"chicken\" because I figured maybe I just got a bad piece. No such luck; it was as repulsive as the first! I'm really wondering what the issue(s) was and hoping that the meat was chicken and not something else.   I told our waiter it was not good, and without me prompting him, he asked if it was tough. I said yes, very tough. He said he would let the kitchen know. At that point, he should have removed the item from our bill, but that didn't happen. And, I was in a hurry and didn't ask for the manager, even though I should have.  The pad Thai with tofu was fine.  I won't ever return there.",

Separately, the dish contained coconut curry and brown rice, which was also phenomenal and can be eaten together. Artistic and exquisite - I would come back here for this dish alone.  My husband ordered their Hung Lay Curry, which was so tasty and unique as well.  If we lived in Pittsburgh, we would definitely come here all the time.

My favorite item by FAR was the Tom Yum soup with shrimp; it had fresh flavors, lots of mushrooms, tomato, onion and scallion, and a perfect spice level at a 2. I liked my Thai Long Island Tea-nice coconut flavor. Egg rolls were good as well, but the Chicken Pad Thai was average, kind of bland, as were the spring rolls. Entree portions were large.  I could eat that soup every day but that's about it...",

Their were (4) waiters behind the bar and not one acknowledged me... I HATE TO PULL THE RACE CARD, but I have to and that's exactly how I felt. I sat there literally 10 min and nothing. I casually got up and as I was walking out I asked a waiter where's the manager and she pointed behind the bar, I WAS LIKE WOW! O ne of the  4 waiters behind the bar was the manager. I shook my head and kept walking. They didn't even care. I surely will not be back here again and I'll make sure out corporate office up here in Pitt knows that as well. Just all out BAD BUSINESS! I FORGOT THE MANAGERS NAME, I THINK ONE OF THE WAITERS SAID CHRIS I MAY BE WRONG, BUT  CHRIS IF YOUR READING THIS \" YOU NEED TO ATTEND TO YOUR CUSTOMERS AND NOT LET THEM SIT AT THE BAR FOR 10+ MINUTES WITHOUT ANYONE ACKNOWLEDGING THEM. I MEAN I WAS THE ONLY ONE AT THE BAR TO. SMH!",

Some of the seating is quite tight and close together.  We both ordered chicken pad Thai.  It came with either soup or salad (lunch special).  We both chose salad.  A yummy salad with a bit of lettuce, cucumber, cherry tomato and carrot.  The pad Thai was honestly the best I have ever had !!!  You can get spiciness level between 1-5 with 5 being hottest.  I got 3 and it really wasn't hot at all.  The sauce had just the right amount of tanginess and sweetness.  The portion was generous for lunch and I ate every drop !!!  The place had totally filled up by the time we finished eating.  There were a few people waiting to be seated when we left.",

Every dish has earned this 5 star rating. You should definitely give it a try. If you want to go on a Friday or Saturday night I would recommend making a reservation as they do get busy, but from my experience other nights of the week you will usually be okay without one.",

I must've moved my small appetizer plate 2 times in which this particular server put it right back in front of me.  As far as the food...my boyfriend got egg rolls which were really great and i got chicken on a skewer served with both cucumber and peanut sauce...sooo good! However, our entrees were disappointing. I got the mango salad, and it tasted great but was hard to eat because of how it was prepared. He got some type.of chicken stir fry but the peanut sauce was overwhelming.

My friend got one of their entrees and the first time she was served it was the wrong protein, the second time her order was incorrect. After sending it back the waitress came over to tell my friend that she was wrong and then we proceeded to wait almost an hour for her food to come back.

The decor is beautiful and their serve ware is also a bit more fancy here. Nicky's Thai has a reputation of being the best Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh and although I think it's great, there are dishes in which I've had better at other places. If you're in the mood for curry and soups, Nicky's Thai is hands down the best. I love their tom kha soup and pineapple curry. However, they can improve on the noodles. There isn't as large of a noodle selection as other places and the signature Thai dish, pad thai, is a little too saucy and sweet. Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty tasty but I've had better. All in all, the best Thai restaurant downtown but there are other Thai restaurants in the city worth trying before declaring Nicky's as the best.",

The description sounded appealing, with peanut sauce, chili paste, coconut milk, etc.  I got mine with veggies and my usual spice level 5.    The taste of the curry was great - definitely hit the spot.  I wouldn't have minded more spice so I'll have to remember that for next time.  My only issue with the dish was there were these ginormous pieces of potatoes which took up most of the space in the curry.

    "text": "We were excited to try Nicky's out upon recommendation from others. Unfortunately, tonight was not our night. This is a negative review, not just because of some poor service and sub-par food, but because we felt an overall lack of care from multiple people on multiple occasions throughout our visit. Many other fellow diners seemed to be having a great time and this made us more uncomfortable.  We arrived at 5:30 and were told we would have to vacate by 6:30. No problem, we were going to a Pirates game at 7p anyway! To be fair, it was quite busy. However, the wait staff seemed to rush us to the point of brusqueness. We ordered promptly and received our appetizer shortly thereafter. We then waited for 45 minutes while at least 8 new, and larger, groups arrived, ordered, and received their appetizers and entrees. Around 6:15 we asked the hostess if we'd still have to be out by 6:30. Since we still did not have our food, we were told we could stay. A few minutes later we were asked to move to a different table so a new couple could come and take ours. After an hour of watching other groups arrive and get their food, we were planning to ask for out check and leave without our entrees when our food was deposited on our table without any apology. The food was cold and regrettably not very good. Mine in particular appeared as if it was hastily prepared and then left to sit for awhile. We had to eat quickly and were still billed the full amount. We could have eaten at PNC Park for less! Multiple dropped balls and missed opportunities made this a very bad experience.",

    "text": "I'm new to town and wanted to find a Thai restaurant downtown. There's hype from my office about Nickys being a great cozy place for lunch or dinner with amazing Thai food.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp as well as the Red Curry with Pork. We choose to have one entree come with a basic chicken and rice soup that had minimal chicken or rice but filled with strips of ginger. Our other entree came with a salad that had something similar to a french dressing with a hint of fish sauce, a slice of tomato, a small strip of mango and one chunk of canned pineapple with iceburg lettuce.  I would have much rather skipped these two appetizers and saved room to try a dessert.   Our Pad Thai was a reasonable portion size but I was thrown off by the short broken pieces of noodles that tasted like they were soaked in fish sauce. Ew. The shrimp was fine, nothing special.   Our Red Curry was a typical Thai restaurant portion size. A small bowl serving of rice was placed next to a soup bowl of curry. The pork pieces are not fresh and the curry had peas and carrots, most likely from a frozen bag, with some bamboo. The actual curry tasted like coconut milk mixed with water.  Our sever was nice and our water was refilled frequently. I asked for additional spices on the side which he was able to bring out quickly.   Not sure what the hype is about or why the restaurant was a packed house. I'd never go back and now I need to find some real Thai food in Pittsburgh.",

Though it is a bit pricier than other Thai restaurants in town, it is very authentic and you are able to customize the spice-level of your dish (from a 1 to 5 range) which allows you to get exactly the level of heat you want. Though it can be hard to find parking in the Cultural District, this meal is worth it!",

I'm used to vietnamese style which are bigger and fuller but these were nice little bite sized Eggrolls (qty 5).  I tried the pineapple curry with chicken (8 heat) for my main meal. It came out pipping hot with the warm rice on the side. It was amazing. I wish I had a bigger stomach. The blend of the curry spices and peppers complimented the sweet pineapple chunks.  Topped it all off with a sake bomb which was light n refreshing. Great place I'd highly recommend it.",

I highly recommend their lunch special that includes a refreshing salad and a single crab rangoon. The massaman and yellow curries are my go to, but I've started to really enjoy the spicy mint beef salad. The tom yum soup for the table with the flaming bowl is pretty neat (and tasty).  When ordering, keep in mind that they aren't kidding about spice levels so anything above a 7/10 is sure to burn at least a little. The services has always been solid. They have very small water glasses, but they are very attentive and make sure they're nearly always full.",

No one took our drink order and it took a while for our server to come around. We wound up ordering everything at once because  we were never sure when he would come back.  Once our food came out it looked amazing. But then I found a peice of a plastic bag in my pad thai. I called our server over and he brought out the manager. But no one ever came back to our table to check on us. Not to see if we possibly wanted another beer. Not to  see if we wanted dessert. Just radio silence.  The north side location is exceptional but this was just a let down.  I'm not sure if it's because we look young but every other table was promptly served and checked on. We won't be coming back.",

Things started out fine until our friends table that ordered their food just after us got theirs first (by far) ... then another set of people we know sat down and ordered.  For some odd reason 35 min had gone by, then 40, at 45 I asked where our food was as the friends that had received their food were ready to pay their bill.  At that point when I asked our waitress where the food was, she got short with me and said it's coming. 2/3 of our table had ordered a soup or appetizer but one guy was just waiting for his entree... at the 55 minute mark after asking the manager (our waitress) again she said our curry was almost ready but waiting on the guy's chicken and broccoli because they needed to steam broccoli.  At that point our curry was brought but the guy that hasn't had anything to eat was still waiting. We had to ask again at the hour mark... FYI still no apology.  Finally he just asked for it to go, and we didn't eat because it was rude so we got boxes.  I had to negotiate our bill as she still was not apologizing and the table that sat as our other friends table ordered ...received food before our guy got his box Togo.  At this point she said she was only taking off the one entree and blaming a slow kitchen even though we saw table after table get their food before us that arrived 10-20 minutes and in one case over 30 minutes after us.  After negotiating she kept repeating that she was only taking one entree off.  After me saying that's unacceptable she brought back a bill with just the appetizers off and even that was a struggle. Needless to say the tip was only rounded up to the nearest dollar.  We had one nice waiter apologize.    Food - decent  Service - mediocre at best  Manager - (also our server) - worst worst worst I've ever had.    Find Thai elsewhere.  Bye.",

    "text": "I used to live in Pittsburgh and have been to the original Nicky's Thai in the Northside.  My parents swear that is the best Thai food they've ever had to this day.  While I was in town over the holidays my husband and I had dinner at this location.  It's probably been 8 or 9 years since I've had Nicky's Thai and honestly I was a little disappointed with it.  The decor and the atmosphere was nice and the food was tasty but non memorable.  The drink selection was really poor with the exception of Chang beer which is what I drank the whole time I was in Thailand a few months ago.   What turned me off the most was that the portions were absolutely ginormous, and the entrees were expensive for Thai food.  If they didn't serve enough food for 3 people in an entree they could lower the prices to something more reasonable.  I split an appetizer and an entree with my husband and it was more than enough food.  Maybe the original is still better but I wouldn't rush back to this location.",

Carefully order the heat level. I ordered 'Thai-Hot' and I was humbled as it made me cry / but it still tasted good. The crabbish appetizer looks good but its boring & not very good (see photo). Mr Tee at the Mgr is great to talk to. Take your time & relax at a cool throwback decor with good food & conversation.",

Luckily we snatched that right up, but you couldn't even tell how busy they were from the outside. I ordered the Chicken Pad See Ew and Penang Curry. Chicken Pad See Ew noodles were a bit soggy (can happen if they're stir fried for too long and the rice noodles start sticking to each other or softening too much), the Penang Curry has more of a lemongrass taste which isn't really my jam so I wouldn't order that next time. My friend told me to order the Wild Rice Curry or something like that so I think I'll try that next time I'm in town. Convenient location and great lunch deals. Their chicken rice soup was SO GOOD / broth was salty enough, lots of rice and the gold spoon made me really feel like I was in Thailand. Forgot to get their Thai iced tea but I remember it was great -- protip: ask for light ice so they give you more tea ;)",

We made reservations but were a bit late because of traffic and luckily they were super nice about it and weren't busy so we were able to be seated.   I got the Thai tea ($2.50) and it was SUPER good. I thought it was very well done I drank mines super fast!   We ordered the Panang and pad see eaw. We got them 5/5 spicy. I didn't think it was actually 5/5 spiciness. The Panang was solid and super yummy, but the pad see eaw was super disappointing. To make it spicier, they literally drenched it in red chili flakes. It gave it a super weird texture that wasn't even spicy, so I didn't really enjoy it. I feel like the underlying flavor is super good, but when it is drenched in red chili flakes, it tasted really odd. The Panang comes with rice, and it filled like half of the bowl it came in. There wasn't a good Panang to rice ratio so we ordered more rice and it was $3!!! I thought that was kind of crazy, it was more expensive than the drink! Also, the extra rice is a lot of rice, so I wish that the rice that came with the Panang actually filled the bowl so you didn't have to order $3 rice.",

    "text": "My experience with the wait staff left me wanting to give Nicky's a 1-star review, but as that would be an unfair, knee-jerk reaction, I'm attempting to write a review that is reflective of the overall experience. We'll start with the good.  I enjoyed the food. I had the tom kha soup with tofu, and the red curry with chicken. The soup was rich and flavorful, and the curry, while a bit on the thin side, was delicious. I'm a lover of spicy food, so I was happy to find that the \"Thai hot\" heat level was exactly what I hoped it would be! There were fresh red chilis sprinkled throughout, and it had me sweating and burning--in a good way! If this review were based solely on the food, it would be an easy four stars.   The service, however, was quite bad. As I said, I ordered soup as well as curry. The waiter failed to explain, however, that all curries come with a soup/salad option, so I ended up with two bowls of soup. The first bowl of soup that came out was tom yum (not tom kha, which I had ordered), so I assumed that he had made an error in putting my food in. He explained the situation to me, so I asked if I could cancel my order of tom kha soup since I already HAD a bowl of soup. This was BEFORE the second bowl of soup came out, mind you. He refused and argued that he asked if I wanted soup or salad and that I had said soup. He never did ask me this, as I would never have ordered two bowls of soup. So both came out, and I only ate one. I never could convince him to remove the second soup from the ticket and ended up spending $5 more than I had planned to.   I doubt I will be back, but I see that Nicky's does have a loyal following. Based on food quality alone, it's easy to see why.",

Server went back twice to get the dishes and finally brought it out (15 minutes since the first entree arrived). The food was not warm, chicken was dry, and it was obvious it got separated and had sat out. Even more evident when my exact same dish was delivered to the next table steaming hot.

    "text": "My husband and I have been wanting to try either of the Nicky's Thai Kitchens for over a year now. Our one attempt to try Nicky's in the North Side was on a Sunday, which we quickly discovered is not a day that they are open.   I work Downtown and decided on Monday that I was going to finally try the newer location of Nicky's just a 7 minute walk from my workplace. Well, this would've been a great idea if it wasn't about 20 degrees outside with an even lower wind chill. However, I somehow innately knew that Nicky's would be worth the (extremely cold and face numbing) effort to get there.   I got back to my office and opened up my $8 Pad Thai to-go lunch. I had selected the side salad to go along with my meal... and it made me laugh. It was in the tiniest takeout container I had ever seen and contained 3 pieces of lettuce, 2 chunks of pineapple, and even smaller portions of everything else. I must admit it was tasty though! My recommendation? Save the cost of the teeny to-go container and offer a larger version of the same side salad for +$2-3 that contains some substance.   Now let's get back to the important matter... the Pad Thai. I consider myself a snob about just a few dishes, and Pad Thai is one of them. If going to a Thai restaurant, I order Pad Thai about 90% of the time. If the Pad Thai is too bland or not sweet enough or contains too many bean sprouts or too little meat, I am not interested in returning to the restaurant.....  Nicky's Pad Thai was the. best. Pad. Thai. I. have. ever. had. I sat at my desk listening to my Monday conference call inhaling the delicious noodles, the perfectly sweet and mildly spicy (the way I like it!) sauce, the crumbled peanuts, the large chunks of green onion, and the scrambled eggs mixed throughout the dish. This is Pad Thai heaven.   To top it off, my meal had a little Crab Rangoon on top, which (behind Pad Thai) is one of my favorite Thai foods. Needless to say, I'll be back for lunch often and can't wait to bring my husband as well.",

Every corner of the place is adorned in Thai decor which gives the place a very calming effect. We visited this place on a Sunday night and even with 30 mins left to close, they took us in and the place was still packed. We got the Crispy Roti for the appetizer and the Pork Red Curry with spice level 5 for the entree. I really loved the Crispy Roti and would recommend that you get it. It is a Chef special item and I can guarantee you will not find it at a lot of places. This is a rare dish to find. The Red Curry was also very good. It was just the right amount of spice and if you are used to having Indian curries, you should be fine. The quantity was also just right that you are able to finish it without wasting. Since we went on a very packed night and close to them closing, we had to wait a long time to get our food and in the rush, we were also accidentally served our Red Curry with Tofu instead of Pork which we later got replaced, which is completely understandable. So, maybe you want to catch them at a lesser peak time. I would still love to visit the place again for the food.",

    "text": "Nicky's has been on my radar for a long time now, but since I'm living on the eastern edge of Bloomfield closer to Shadyside I've been sticking to Noodlehead for sit-down Thai and Thai Gourmet for takeout. After a long, cold day yesterday I decided to take the plunge and treat myself to takeout from Nicky's on the way home from work. I phoned in my order, and it was ready eight minutes later when I showed up to collect it. The lady at the front was incredibly nice and the space looks cute, so it's somewhere I'd consider coming back to for a sit-down meal.  I ordered the Phad See Eaw  with chicken at a 5/10 spice level. I like what I would consider a middle of the road spice level for Thai. At Noodlehead I get a 4/5 for the Phad Thai (It literally starts out with no spice to begin with) and a 3/5 for the Street Noodle #1. The level 5 at Nicky's was perfect for a regular evening. Just a little kick, but not too much. If I was in the mood for more spice a 6 or a 7 would have been appropriate. The sauce was evenly distributed and not overly sweet, which I really liked. The chicken and broccoli pieces were surprisingly good as well. Meat and vegetables can be sadly over or under done in all forms of takeout, but Nicky's did a great job. Overall this was some of the most delicious Thai I've had in Pittsburgh, and I can't wait to come back and try more menu options.",

I definitely suggest making a reservation to save yourself the hassle. First issue, my crew thought that it was BYOB. Turns out only the north side location is. So we were there with our 3 bottles of wine that we couldn't drink.   It was crazy packed like I said. So service was extremely slow. I was the first one to order an appetizer and my server forgot to put it in. I didn't get my egg rolls until I received my entree. I will say, the Pad Thai is sooooo good. Nice size portion, perfectly seasoned, appropriate spice level (lol, I recommend getting a 2 spice level).  It took about 45 minutes to get our dinner, but it was worth the wait. It took another 30 minutes to get our check.   I did order a drink. It was strong, but it wasn't too tasty. A basil Hendricks with gin. Ugh. Don't get that if you want a fruity drink. Lol. But I drank it because I'm a lush!",

Some restaurants with multiple locations can have something amiss at times, but that definitely was not the case here.  The environment is definitely more upscale appealing than the Western Ave spot.  It's more in line with being in the Cultural District I presume.  They also have a liquor license here unlike the other location.    We ordered items we would normally get and they definitely were consistent with the other location which was awesome.  Equally as awesome :)   Service was great too.  I highly recommend it!",

They have Singha beer if that is of interest along with other beers and wines. The food was tasty, piping hot, came out on time. The only thing they could improve on would be service. The servers are slow and don't pay much attention. Took me a few tries to flag someone down. They are really pleasant just inattentive. I was one of the last diners there and they patiently waited for me to finish before starting to close up. Bonus points for that. Most places usually start mopping and putting up chairs as an indication for you to go, thereby effectively ruining your dining experience. Nicky's was very good in this regard.  Overall, great food, good prices and average service.",

Interior is really captivating. Tons of Thai and Thai inspired artwork all around. It's not the largest place and if it's an extremely packed night, you may feel a little cramped. Lighting is really good. Softly dim but bright enough to see everything clearly. Dress code...it's not an uptight place so wear whatever you feel comfortable in. Service is friendly and very attentive. Okay, on to the food! SO FREAKING GOOD. To start off they'll give you a spice level. 1-5, I like spicy but I was eating with a Russian so to be safe for him :), we went with a level 2. We ordered the shrimp cakes, chef's special the Param Chicken, and the Crispy Pomfret. Seasoning was phenomenal, wait time for food was way better than expected and portions were filling and perfect. Appealing display of food :). My only negative is the sound level in there. They weren't playing any music to set the ambiance and because the ceiling was so high, noise sounded twice as loud.  Other than that, new favorite place.",

Our group made a reservation on a Friday night, and I think it is probably necessary to do so to get a seat.  There are probably enough seats for 50-75 people total.  I like the ambiance of Nicky's. It is definitely a slightly upscale but still casual feeling. The tables are close together but not claustrophobic feeling.  Service is quick and friendly enough.   The actual food is quite delicious. My friend and I decided to split the pad Thai ($12.50) at spice 2 and Red Curry ($13.50) at spice 2. I am going to go against what other reviewers say because I thought the spices went mild, personally. I would probably choose to order a 4. The Pad Thai was really delicious with a super portion, but the Red Curry won me over. I have never tried the dish previously, but it was a super interesting mix of tastes in my mouth. Huge fan of the red curry!  Additionally, Nicky's was spot on for the extreme allergies in our group. There was no contamination of gluten, sugar, or meat in the dishes of the people who had dietary restrictions, which is super impressive!  Overall, I really enjoyed Nicky's and would especially recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced dinner before a show in the Cultural District.",

I normally do a 7, but I have to do a 4-5 here.    I have had the LadNa/Rad Na and the Pad See Eww, both are excellent, but the Rad Na/Lad Na are better at my favorite Thai, Smiling Banana leaf.    The service has always been spot on and course timing was appropriate.  I have also had the Thai iced tea here, it's a little too sweet for me, maybe it was the person who made it that day.

That being said- the crab rangoon is out of this world!!! So delicious. It comes with many of the lunches as well as a soup or salad.   I'm pretty new to Thai but I do love the pineapple fried rice and the basil fried rice with vegetables. The spice scale was 1-10 and now it's 1-5, so that's a little confusing but I like some spice so I'll order on the higher end. Prices are much more reasonable at lunch as opposed to dinner, but the portions are big. They also do takeout, so that's a good option if you're in a hurry. I'd say it's a great option to take someone for a meal when you're downtown.",

My most recent time here, I tried the Tiger Cry beef (really tiny portion even for an appetizer), the samosas, the spicy eggplant tofu, red curry, pad Thai, and pad phet beef. Everything was delicious, but Nicky's pad Thai definitely used to be much better. They also used to do a 1-10 scale for spicyness which I preferred much more to the current 1-5 scale. I also had the hot tea that had bourbon in it which was good and pretty well worth the $10 it was since I got about 3 cups of tea out of it. Overall, I think I'd opt for Noodlehead over Nicky's, even though their selection is lower...I just don't think Nicky's is the absolute best anymore.",

We ordered spicy chicken wings.  Fried wings then tossed with sauce.  Tender, good heat, still a bit hot.  Pumpkin curry Duck... Heat level 4.  No spice at all.  Large chunks of Japanese pumpkin with thin slices of duck... Initially I thought they gave me BBQ pork by mistake since I have not seen duck sliced do thin.  It had a reddish hue, they said it's marinated.  I confirmed the Duck when I had a piece of skin and fat.  Yummy over white rice.",

    "text": "My husband and I went last night for dinner before a show at the Benedum. It was not full when we got there as it was only 6pm. Our waiter gave us menus and returned a few minutes later asking \"are you ready to order?\" He didn't ask if we wanted a drink or appetizers to start. We felt very rushed. Our food arrived very quickly. The food was fine. Kanlaya in Hampton is better. Nothing overwhelming.  The waiter did check on us--probably too much. We were still clearly eating but maybe \"picking\" more and talking more/relaxing. We were asked by 3 different people within 5 minutes if I needed a box and if we were ready for the check.  Did not ask if we wanted dessert or anything. It was to the point that we wanted to leave because we felt so rushed. We were there maybe 50 minutes from start to finish. I have a really high threshold for annoyances and poor service. But when I go out to dinner, I go because I want to relax and spend time with people.   I can overlook a lot, but it really bothers me when I feel like I'm an annoyance or when a restaurant is more focused on turning tables than ambiance and experience.",

So if you have a big party, be prepared to not be able to talk to anyone more than one seat away from you.   Overall, Nicky's is a great place for Thai, particularly if you are downtown and want to grab a quick meal with a colleague. I wouldn't recommend the venue for large parties, though.",

First of all, the busser was extremely rude and did not speak a single word to us. There was a pool of water on our table so we asked her to wipe it for us. She walks away without saying a thing, comes back, plops the dish rag down on the table, hastily wipes the table, then walks away all the while having the most disgruntled expression on her face. The waiter was much nicer but he was so busy waiting on tables AND bartending that he barely came over to us. We waited 45 minutes and our food had not come out, yet. The waiter, only after seeing our annoyed faces, went to check on our food in the kitchen. We did not get our food for another 15 minutes. This was the most frustrating experience I've ever had a restaurant. Let me also add that they turned on all the lights in the middle of dinner then kept flicking the lights on and off. I am definitely not coming back here ever again.",

They close from 4-5 just FYI in between the end of lunch and to prep for the beginning of dinner. So we had to walk around downtown a bit but I would say that the wait was definitely worth it! We got an appetizer of egg rolls which were pretty good and flavorful even without the sauce. And she got green curry and I got red curry! The serving sizes were pretty decent but I didn't like how they gave us a bigger bowl of rice to share, rather than our own individual bowls. But the curry themselves were super delicious and the rice was perfectly cooked.  The service was weird but oddly really attentive. Like even if I took a sip of my drink, they'd come to refill it right away, which I'm not complaining about. That was nice. But the waiter who took our order and the waiter who refilled our drinks and the waiter who took our plates away, were all different people so I didn't really know where my tip was going. . . or who I was supposed to ask when we needed something. But I mean we were taken care of, so I guess that's what's important.  This place is a little pricey, but then again it's downtown and it was for dinner. So that's somewhat expected.

I've tried a fair amount of their menu, as well as the Thai offerings elsewhere around the city.   Nikky's is trendy. The back garden is beautiful, but the seating in the front is literally packing 20+ people into a living room, as the restaurant lives in a converted house.  As far as the food is concerned, it is strictly OK. The curries are always pretty good, especially the pumpkin curry, but everything, EVERYTHING is PACKED with Saffron. Also, if you like all of your food to taste low level like fish, regardless of what you ordered, this might be the place for you.  They DO have the best crab rangoons in the known universe though. So get those, I guess.",

This instills trust in a customer such as myself.  5 stars for great food, great service and an overall great experience.",

It's great as a quick, midday lunch or even as a nice dinner date on the weekend.   I'm not sure if it's on the menu but my favorite dishes here were the curries (I believe one of my favorites had chunks of mango in it) and the fried rice. One of my fav fried rice dishes here was the crab fried rice but I don't see it on the menu anymore.   I loved the downtown location and how it's an easy walk to other places on Penn Ave.",

The server was very terse with us from the get go.  It wasn't the norm.  All went ok other than that.  He was clear that there was no way to split the bill.  We were ok with that. The shocker was when the bill came with a 25% gratuity added.  We all expect added gratuity with a large group.  25% with no advanced notice shocked us.  We wouldn't have questioned 18% and would've rounded up.  We probably wouldn't have blinked at 20% either.  When we saw 25% and all acknowledged that not only was there nothing great about the service, the server was also rushed and a bit rude throughout the evening we left thinking we wouldn't return.",

Only medium because in other places the medium is stronger than I can appreciate. I think I would go a little spicier next time. The steak was flavorful and had a good balance of lettuce, mint, and cucumbers.  The thai tea is more tea-like than I have encountered, but it was still flavorful.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone.",

Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  The eggrolls arrived, nicely garnished with a delightful dipping sauce.  5 mini egg rolls, that were fried, but not at all greasy.  Pretty tasty.  The entree, was very good, huge portion, lots of tender chicken, crunchy cashews, crisp broccoli, carrots and onion in a delightful sweet/spicy sauce.  I substituted brown rice ($2.50 upcharge) for the white rice.  The brown rice was much different than I expected, really dark brown, and a bit sticky, but yummy and a great accompaniment to the entree.  I didn't have room for dessert, maybe next time. Also my server Ben was very cordial and accomodating.  I'll definitely return to Nicky's!",

Once seated, the tables are pretty cramped.. so much so that their floor decor touches your seat. I had the dubious pleasure of sitting next to one of their statues of women with the prominent nipples staring at me at eye-level!  All lunch entrees give you a choice between soup or salad. The salad was amazing: mango slice with tomato, red onion, and some kind of sweet red (light) dressing.   My entree, on the other hand, was not as enjoyable. I ordered the Wild Curry. It is one of the few curry dishes without coconut milk, and it was horrible!  It was either overly salted or contained too much fish sauce (methinks the latter). The folks I was eating with also could smell the fish sauce.   Everyone else at the table enjoyed their dishes: cashew chicken and red curry. But do yourself a favor and stay away from the Wild curry, folks (unless you want your stomach to do wild flips on ya!)",

    "text": "Nicky's is a restaurant that's been on my list to go to for a long time.  So when a friend of mine suggested meeting for dinner, I suggested Nicky's.  We went on a weeknight (Wednesday) at 6 and the place was crowded when we got there and got progressively more crowded (and loud) as our time there progressed.  We went on a summer's night which was not super hot but with all the people in the restaurant, it did get a little stuffy, but not completely uncomfortable.  They had a menu of daily drink specials and one of food specials.  My friend got a Thai beer and I got a mango sangria drink made with pino grigio.  It was nice and refreshing.  We both decided to skip the entrees.  I got a bowl of Tom Yum soup and a mango and grilled chicken side salad.  My friend got two items from the daily special, it was called \"puff puff\" I think and looked like a miniature fried pie, and the mussels.  The tom yum soup was amazing, very full flavored and filled with herbs and vegetables (I got the vegetarian option).  The \"side\" salad of grilled chicken and mango would have been an entree salad anywhere else, it was quite large.  I ordered both at a 4 for spiciness, and it was perfect mild to medium hot.  My friend liked the puff puff but being deep fried cornmeal based app, she said it was a little heavy but very good.  She raved about the mussels.  She ordered the sticky rice with mango for dessert and loved it.  My only very small quibble is that I didn't get a knife with my meal and the mango grilled chicken salad had no mango on it (unless a very small amount was pureed into the sauce).  The vegetables in both the soup and the salad were in large pieces and it would have made eating them a little easier.  Of course I could have opened my mouth and asked for a knife, which I will do next time.  :)  Given the portion size, the prices are reasonable.  Everything was also very fresh and you could tell freshly made, too.  I would highly recommend Nicky's.",

I mean come on, what dish that comes with an egg on it isn't good?!  (Lunches have a bonus crab Rangoon too, sometimes)  The lunches come with a salad or soup, but you have to get the salads because of the dressing. It's like a Thai sweet pineapple dressing.

Also this is not a place to eat if you're vegetarian or vegan, their menu is so misleading to the public, it advertise something and it's entirely different when you start asking questions about it. We have been going here for a while as Thai was one of my favorite cousin, until my experience at this restaurant. Everytime we used to go there we used to ask the waiter/waitress there about their vegitarian options and once we decided what we want to eat, we made sure we tell them and make a point so they know that we are vegetarian, so please make sure there is no meat or fish of any sort in our food and we were promised it was  % vegitarian. Our last and final visit to this place we were being told that all of their curries and soups were made with  sauce and that they use oyster sauce in the egg rolls that is supposed to be vegitarian. The manager name Bee was absolutely rude like she didn't care to hear our concerns and just kept asking us did you specify this or that, or did you tell the waitress about no fish or anything, like it was our fault. First of the menu doesn't mention that they use fish sauce in the curries and when you tell them to make sure there is absolutely no meat or fish in our food, what does it mean? Wouldn't you as a waiter/waitress mention about the fish sauce if some one said make sure there is no meat or fish, common sense says \"YES\". So all this time we thought we were getting % vegitarian food, but we weren't. Will be sure to report this chain to FDA for their miss leading information.",

Without question, Nicky's Thai Kitchen is one of my absolute FAVORITE restaurants!   The decor is unique and elegant, giving the restaurant its traditional Thai ambiance. Absolutely incredible sculptures and artwork! The food is high quality from the preparation down to the ingredients. Additionally, the menu is very vegetarian and vegan friendly! I have tried many of their different appetizers and entrees, but nothing beats the Phad Thai and the Phad See Eaw. The BEST noodle dishes I've ever had! Insanely delicious and flavorful, plus it comes in large portions.   Since this is a popular spot, the restaurant can get congested and loud plus, there can be a wait if you don't throw in a reservation. The employees are usually running from table to table, so service can be slow, but in my opinion, it's a small price to pay for an amazing meal. If you are unfortunate enough to have never experienced Nicky's Thai Kitchen, drop everything and get some Phad Thai!!",

Pad Thai is pretty good and I think that's the only good dish we had. Penang curry is too salty and the cook forgot to add some sugar so the flavor will be more complete. Tom Kha soup has cabbage and this is the first time I see cabbage in Tom kha soup. Didn't go well with the soup though so I guess this creativity is very inappropriate. Anyway, I've had a much better Thai meal at a regular Thai restaurant.",

At exactly noon I was there at the door ready to get my order but there was a line, out the door, for takeout orders. After waiting 25 minutes out in the cold and seeing ONE person get their takeout order in all that time I left. I could actually see my name on an order sitting there behind the desk but they didn't have a single person actually giving people their food. The one guy who did get his food only did so by harassing the hostess to give him his order already. Since I didn't feel like screaming and stamping my feet I went back to my desk where a protein bar awaits as a really cruddy substitute for my thai lunch. Even had I gotten it eventually it would have been cold and soggy after sitting around. Nicky's does realize that they are downtown and catering to working people who have very limited lunch breaks, right? The real nerve is that they did have time to call me later and yell at me for not paying for my food. Well, if you won't give me my food how can I possibly pay for it?",

My colleagues had a duck dish (very good), red snapper (ditto), and a vegetarian dish that was FAR too spicy.   In general the spice levels seemed uneven given that three of four people ordered \"medium\". (I ordered mild and  mine was in fact mild.)  Service was not super fast, but not problematically slow. Cheerful server, very flexible and willing to put the check on two credit cards. I would go back!",

    "text": "After spending a week in the city for a conference we were able to sample quite a few restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, we weren't blown away by any of them. On our final night we decided to try Nicky's. The decor was really well done, and the service was very good. Unfortunately, we had one big problem with the food. In a word... SALT. And not just a little too much salt - WAY TOO MUCH SALT. We could easily see the potential in the cooking here. The food itself seemed fresh, but the great Thai flavors (basil, coconut, etc) were completely overwhelmed by salt. We would have loved to give this place at least 4-stars, and we think the food alone would rate at least 4-stars, but all that salt just killed the experience. Hey Nicky, ditch the MSG. Your cooking can stand on its own without it!",

It might actually be my favorite Pad Thai in the burgh, but curries are my jam and I can't say it's my fave, but they do nail it.  Their vegetables are vibrant and colorful and cooked to perfection and I like a little heat and they definitely deliver.  I honestly would give them five stars except I've been at two separate parties where they were the main food ordered for take out and it was completely inedible because of the spice.   It's possible my hosts in both cases asked for too high a number, but I feel like if the kitchen knew this was for a lot of people, they shouldn't dumped quite so many red pepper flakes in the mix.  I think it's something they could easily offer to pack on the side and let people add at their own speed.",

I waited for my order over one hour when I order an hour before the food was prepared... The hostest has to be a complete idiot, because when I came to pick up my food she kept telling oh it'll be a few minutes after waiting an hour I left after paying for my food. I told this goof troop that I'll be back for my money and a word with the manager once I get off of work. So I called in one of my rant fits and the hostest said 'Ohhh your Sarena it's been sitting here since you paid' I mean really wtf... You took my money but kept playing the wait game.

There is simply no consistency at this restaurant. When the owner is cooking it's great and the spice levels are good. When he has someone new in the kitchen -- which seems to be very often -- the food stinks, it's bland.. The boxed stuff at the grocery is better. I hope they will read this review and do something about it. I've mentioned it to them but no one seems to care. People keep coming. The problem is they don't come back if the food isn't good.",

    "text": "I'd been to Nicky's downtown location a couple of times in the past, and I'd had a great experience, but this last time was out of this world. It's my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. I went with a friend who is new to Thai food and she decided to play it safe and get the Pad Thai with beef and wonton soup. I get what I always get - spicy noodles with pork and Tom Ka Soup, both as spicy as they can make it. (Their Tom Ka is the most heavenly, flavorful soup I've ever tasted. It is SO delicious.) We also got Thai Iced Tea (so addictive) and steamed dumplings as an appetizer, and we both agreed that they were the best dumplings we'd ever had. My friend was initially disappointed in her Pad Thai, because she thought it was far too sweet, but our wonderful server went out of his way to have the dish fixed for her, and when it came back it was MUCH better and less sweet. She was quite satisfied with it. (But in the meantime, she had tasted my soup and my dinner and immediately regretted not getting the same thing I got. Haha) After we finished our meals, we each got Thai Rice Custard - I picked the pumpkin variation with black sticky rice so we could try both. They were absolutely exquisite, as expected. At the end of our meals, we were stuffed full (the portions are huge) and completely delighted with the food, service, decor - everything. We both agreed that this is a five star restaurant all around, and it's certainly the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. I can't recommend Nicky's enough!",

    "text": "Lawrenceville's Istanbul was closed for the evening once again (gone for good?), and I desired supper since milady Kay was away with a girl buddy for the evening, so to this newest incarnation of Nicky's I arrived with a raging appetite after work this past icy, windy Friday.   Golden elephant gods and nearly naked female deities loomed over me in the shaded, candlelit room, watching me curiously but benevolently.   Nicky's fare is deceptively infernal. I ordered my entree at a humble \"medium\" when asked and was left with a tongue as numb as the mind of an avid \"Jerseyliscious\" viewer.   Beginning the proceedings was a serving of their Salmon Curry Cakes, which I might have liked even more had they been spongier and less springy. Saving this close-to-mediocre dish was the syrupy cucumber sauce that itself was piquant enough to wake a sleeping palate.   The main event consisted of Pad Cha Squid, a dish that brought me to my knees with an essence that burned like scorpion venom.   My nose ran with goo, my eyes filled with saline, my cheeks became ruddy, and my mouth sizzled, rendering me almost mute as I struggled to eat the al dente calamari, the Thai eggplant (!), the white rice, the curry sauce that deluged the entire dish, proteins, vegetables and all.   I heard the spice fiends of the Yelposphere cackling then as I hear them now in my head. I curse thee sadists!  Unsettling me further was that I almost requested a spice level of 10 instead of a mere 5. It's too horrible to comprehend what might have been.   Barely finishing the dish, I quickly paid my tab and hurried across Penn Avenue to Ben and Jerry's for that which exorcises demonic, maniacal, and racy foods: Ice Cream.   P.S. The service was excellent, friendly, and seemed heartily amused to watch me attempt to wrestle Ravana in a bowl. My soul is safe...for now.",

    "text": "Some of my co-workers and I love going to Nicky's for lunch during the workday. Like any other downtown restaurant, it gets pretty busy around noon, but you won't ever have to wait long if there does happen to be a wait. They're very good at getting people in and out.  You can't beat the amount of food you get. Most entrees also come with a soup or salad. And unless your appetite is huge, you will probably be able to take half of your food with you as leftovers. My favorite thing to get is the Pad See Ew. Their rice noodles are really wonderful. I've also tried a few curries and they are excellent as well. I also love the little crab Rangoon that comes with your meal. I often find myself craving Nicky's on days I've already bought lunch....  The one thing I'm a bit confused by at Nicky's is the scale they use for the spiciness level of your food.  When you order your server will ask you to choose a number between 1 and 10 for how spicy you'd like your meal to be, 1 being least spicy, 10 being the most. For my Pad See Ew I usually get a 3 or 4 and that's right where I like the heat of my food,lots of flavor but not burning my mouth. But once I chose one of the curries and ordered a 4 and it was so spicy I could barely eat it. I asked the waiter about it and he said that dish is already spicy to begin with before the scale is applied. So I guess you just have to be careful and consider the ingredients that are already in your meal before choosing your heat number!  I could really come and eat here multiple times a week, but then I would have an empty wallet and weigh 300 pounds. I definitely recommend this Nicky's location for lunch if you work downtown, or for a meal any other time!",

    "text": "I heard about this place from Face Book, which listed (the Western Ave. location) as one of the 10 best unknown restaurants in Pittsburgh. Since we were going to the theater, we decided to try out this one on Penn Ave. and we were not disappointed in the least. Since we were on a tight schedule, I made reservations for Friday night at 6:30 about 1:00 that afternoon. They were able to accommodate us and even though we arrived about 10 minutes late due to heavy traffic, they seated us immediately. Which was great since there was a line out the door when we arrived! I guess some others read that FB page too! I highly recommend making a reservation on a weekend night! After being seated, we did wait about 10 minutes for a waiter to come by. But they were crazy busy and turning tables over as fast as they could. We ordered a  couple of speciality drinks and placed our order for Spring Rolls and one Pad Thai, which we shared. So glad we did,  cause when it came, it was huge! Our drinks were brought with the appetizer. My Dirty Thai Martini was really good. A bit different with basil stuffed olives, but delicious just the same. The Spring rolls were fantastic. So fresh and a nice dipping sauce with lots of carrots and red cabbage on the plate. Then the Pad Thai came. Ours was made with chicken and my friend who moved here from Chicago said it was the best she has had since she moved. One of the best I have had as well. Even after arriving late and waiting for our initial contact with the waiter, we were able to get out the door on time as they must be cranking out the food from that kitchen at an unbelievable pace. Not just fast,  but beautifully presented and delicious. I won't comment on the decor as others have. It's a Thai restaurant and pretty much what I would expect. The tables were very close together and the noise level was fairly high. But you could talk easily to your dinner partner without shouting.  I definitely want to go back and try some other dishes,  but I think I would be fun to go in a group of 4-6 and order dishes to share so we can try more things. I grabbed a take out menu on the way out the door so I can study it before the next visit. I hope it happens soon!",

Any more and I would have been sweating and struggling to enjoy it. The pieces of Asian pumpkin in the dish have a texture and taste like an almost al dente potato. Highly recommend. The service is fast and attentive and they easily managed the lunch rush. The place is crowded and loud (our table was 8\" from the couple next to us.) So it's not the place for an intimate or private meeting but if you want some great Thai food quickly it is a very good choice.",

After trying almost everything on their menu, I keep coming back to Garprow Pork Lad Kao. For around $9, this dish can't be beat. It has flavorful meat, rice, egg and some greens. The steamed dumplings make for an excellent appetizer, and the dipping sauce they serve with the dumplings is very well done.  My only gripe with this place is the inconsistency in their 1-10 spice scale. A 9 tastes like 6 one day and 8 the other. I just gave up and started ordering 10. Maybe I should try 'Thai Hot', but I don't think my colleagues will appreciate that ;)",

    "text": "Finally the 5 star meal that I knew was coming. I have always thought that the waiters at Nicky's are professional and sweet. I get the feeling that they know they work at a good restaurant.   The shrimp red chili just wasn't doing it for me and I eaten that dish close to five times.  It lacked that wow factor that so many other Yelpers had written about.  So on my last visit I had previously promised to myself I would change it up.  I went with the spicy fish basil, spicy number 7.  Talk about flavor.  Here I had found just what I wanted.  The spicy fish basil was one of the very  few Asian dishes I had ever eaten where the vegetables were every bit as good as the meat.  Finding the eggplant in the dish was like uncovering little treasures. Yes the fish was good but the veggies were also phenomenal.  The spicy fish basil has it all:  basil, eggplants, onions, shoots, tilapia and yellow bell peppers.  I am sure I'm leaving something out but this dish had it going on!  This was the first time I had ever experienced the herb basil used in a non Italian dish. I was blown away by the preparation .   There was less sauce on the dish then I'm use to getting a Nicky's.  So I found myself having to tilt the plate and scrape sauce from the bottom to spoon over my rice. I would as for a little more sauce please.  I also would like to mention that dining here on Sunday night was my first time BYOBing .   I researched online what was considered \"B\" . I got a six pack of tall boys and brought them along as my dining companion.  It went over very well and BYOB is the way to go!    There are many  special touches around the restaurant too.  Here are just a few that stood out to me.  The golden chalice that the rice is served in.  The fresh yellow daisies on all the tables, and the gold flatwear and also I am so in love with the golden Buddhist deity statues everywhere it really makes the restaurant look opulent. I never gave up on Nicky's and I've found a dish that I love. Plus they have the best pork dumplings.",

I ordered it at a 10 while my husband ordered his Thai hot.  The waiter was very concerned that it would be way too hot for us, but I am happy to report that the 10 was actually a 10! Most places I can order a 20 and still need to add chili.  Here the sauces were flavorful and hot! The Tom Kha was amazing!    The service was great and the drinks were constantly full. We will definitely be returning!",

The decor is similar inside but it definitely doesn't have the patio/garden that the North Side has.  Side note - these one star reviewers are crazy. You cannot judge a restaurant on service in the first couple of weeks that it opens. Whether it's upscale dining or greasy spoon diner (or a Thai kitchen), there are always hiccups in service at the start. I hope they come and try again.",

The salad is plentiful and amazingly delicious. The tomato was on it's way to rotten and the spice wasn't what I would call a \"Five,\" but aside from that the mango was wonderful and the chicken grilled to perfection. Bonus - when it appeared to our server that I was having trouble reading in the [very] dimly lit dining area, he quickly supplied a mini flashlight. Now that's service.

We decided to order through grub hub this is my first time doing this and having it delivered and my experience was by far amazing and the food made it the more better. I will definitely be eating here again before I leave for home. 100% recommend the pat Thai and the beef salad reminds me a lot like my dads cooking, loved it!",

Water was constantly filled, dishes were bussed in a timely manner, and going above and beyond our server offered to take the group photo first.  Food for me personally could have been more tangy/tart/sour. I like a heavy hand with kaffir like leaf, lemongrass and galanga.   We ordered the spicy noodles (tofu), duck curry, green curry (chicken), curry noodles (beef), mussels, Tom Kha (seafood). The family were happy with most of the meal except for the mussels. There were shells but a lot of missing mussels. I wouldn't recommend the mussels or the curry noodles.",

    "text": "My favorite Thai food restaurant in Pittsburgh! I ordered the cashew entree and loved it. Firstly, they give you a lot of food. They don't skimp out on veggies, meat, or cashews, so you're able to taste all the different flavors with each bite. Plus I had plenty left over for dinner the following night. Second, the veggies and meat are cooked perfectly. My chicken wasn't chewy and the broccoli, peppers, and onions were seasoned and cooked just right so they weren't too chewy or too soft. The menu has plenty of delicious sounding options to choose from and they are all reasonably priced with the quality and quantity of food you are given.  The restaurant itself is smaller, so I recommend calling ahead and making a reservation, otherwise you might have to wait for seats to open up. Inside is dimly lit and classier than other Thai restaurants I've visited. It feels intimate even though the tables are close to each other. Definitely recommend eating here!",

The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but the decor inside has been updated and very nice. It's quaint, but very clean and the service was FAST!   My go-to dishes at any Thai restaurant are crab Rangoon and Pad See Ewe. Both were delicious !!!  The portion sizes were perfect, not too big or small. I was bummed to see no edamame on the menu. They also had a small bar at the back of restaurant and I saw many people enjoying bottles of wine with their meal!   If you find yourself in the area - check it out !!!! It's delicious !",

I might spend as much time staring at the golden mirrored ornamental designs around me as I do the menu or talking with my friends, which is not to say that the quality of the food is anything less.  I am always impressed by their wide selection of curries, noodles, and appetizers. My favorite dish so far is the panang curry - the notes of lime, basil, and cilantro are soothing and comforting, the right mix of sweet and savory, perfect with a side of rice. Their appetizers are delicious as well - I recommend the deep-fried shrimp cakes which go well with the accompanying light cucumber sauce.   Just writing this review makes me want to go back when I get the chance to have the same exact thing as last time even though there's so many things on the menu I promise myself I'll try next time.",

I love that you can get delivery and I love that I don't have to go to the northside just to enjoy Nicky's anymore. I've always gotten great service and never had to wait long to be seated here. It is BYOB which is divine because you can surely guzzle down a bottle or two of wine with their spicy foods. They have some really great Crab Rangoon that they throw in for free on deliveries over a certain amount, but I say order it regardless, you won't regret it. Whenever I get that hankering for some spicy noodle dishes or curries I pop into Nickys because I know it's a solid choice and it'll never let you down!",

I've continued to be a customer of theirs for many years. I must say it has gone downhill. You get a lot of sauce with little meat and veggies. The servers are not as friendly as they once were. You are not often greeted in a friendly fashion. Sometimes there is a bad timing issue; appetizer and food come too close or entree takes forever to come out.  So you may say, why do you still go back? Well, because it used to be really good and I'm hoping it will be again.  However, the last time we were there was the last time. My son (an visual artist) was sitting against the wall, I on the chair opposite him. Our meals arrived. The server put my dish down then handed my son his dish. The server did not indicate the temperature of the plate. It was very hot. My son dropped it onto the table (his hand hurt for a long period of time). The server walked away. Management did not come to apologize (nor did the server). I asked to speak to the manager and someone came over. I explained what happened. She said, \"I'll make sure that doesn't happen again.\"",

    "text": "So we were craving Thai food so my brother brought us to the \"best\" Thai restaurant in town. When we ordered our waitress had limited knowledge about the dishes on the menu. We asked if the coconut juice was fresh or canned and she said not fresh or canned. So we ordered one glass of it. For appetizers we got chicken satay. I've been to Malaysia and Singapore so I know my satay. This was NOT satay! It was boiled chicken on a stick! No grill marks.   When we tried the coconut juice and it was pure sugar. So we asked our waitress to change it for a coconut mojito instead and her response was \"we can't\". You can't change our drink for something else we want and will pay for??? She walked away and never returned to our table to ask about the food. Such awful service!!!  The food was so underwhelming!!  Don't fall into the trap of the reviews if you're a real Thai food connoisseur!",

I ordered the Thai Style Fried Rice with chicken. I got a Thai 6 for the spice level. I like spicy food and have gotten a 9 there before. The rice was a generous portion. I ate a little over half and took the rest to go. I really enjoyed the large chunks of green onion and the slices of chicken. The salad my meal came with was also delicious. It had the perfect amount of dressing and the mango was fresh.   I didn't get an appetizer this time, but when I do, I go with the crab Rangoon. It's amazing! One comes with your meal, but who can eat only one!?   This restaurant is also great for take out. If you're running late to lunch or even if you want grab something after you leave a happy hour downtown, it's perfect. I ordered it once and it was ready in less than 30 minutes.   Overall, Nicky's has the best Thai in Pittsburgh!",

I have zero complaints about it; it was absolutely delicious and I'm glad that they didn't condescend on that spice.  (Sometimes restaurants around here think you really want a 3 when you legitimately ask for a 7 or 8!)  The service was friendly and quick too.

    "text": "One the best Thai meals I have had hands down!! This is my first time to Nicky's and while parking is a pain, the food makes up for it. My 5 star rating is explained below on the basis of service, proportion of food, taste, quality and overall experience.  We went there at 10 p.m. on a Saturday, which was almost closing time. I have found that you get very good service around closing but on the flip side, you are rushed a bit and the staff starts cleaning around you.  Anyways, once seated we looked over the menu and made our selections (drinks aside). We got the Thai Roti as an appetizer, which was fried dough with curry and peanut dips, served with lettuce and carrot garnishing. One plate was well portioned for 4 people. While delicious, I was hoping to get some more curry rather than just a miserly dip-sized bowl.  On to the entrees: we ordered the Red Curry with fish (extra spicy), Basil Fried Rice with chicken and shrimp (medium spicy), Gap rap Lad Kao with chicken (medium spicy) and the Siracha Noodles with chicken (medium spicy). While their medium spicy was pretty hot, I really enjoyed the Red Curry too - a real good sweat!! The fish and vegetables in the curry were not an afterthought, and the curry flavors had permeated very well into them.   The Basil Fried Rice was tasty in its own way. I got the strong basil flavor and the spice level was perfect. I usually find the meat in the rice and noodles to be pretty bland, but not in this case. Very well flavored again and in the right proportion.  Siracha Noodles were flat noodles with hot Siracha sauce. I did find the noodles to be a little mushy (overcooked) in places but maybe that was just me being too nit-picky. Again a great noodle dish and it was not too spicy (atleast for my taste buds).  Another star entree was the Gap rap Lad Kao. It had minced chicken on top of boiled white rice, and a fried egg decorating the dish. If you mixed everything well, each bite was delectable and it definitely had some punch to it. I was afraid that the white rice would dim the spice and flavors but I was surprised with each and every bite. Truly, another awesome dish on the menu.  I have to say, the portions were huge, the flavors were plentiful and the service was prompt. We probably got our meal in 15 mins (closing time means faster service), but we did not feel rushed at all. A pleasant 5 star dining experience, coupled with elaborate decor. I look forward to visiting the other location and comparing my experience at Nicky's.",

It was ok, again not the best I've had...somewhat salty and lacked some of the typical flavors I've had at other Thai restaurants, i.e. Light on the lime juice and too heavy on the fish sauce.

The only thing is when we got the remainder of the food to go they wrapped our curry and rice together in a to go bowel instead of separate. This gave me a rice curry soup when I got home.

    "text": "We were in the neighborhood and I was suddenly having a craving for Thai. We went in without a reservation and were seated immediately since it was still pretty early. But if you want to go after 730, a reservation is definitely needed.  I ordered a spicy noodle dish with pork. On a spicy scale 1 to 10, I asked for 10. The dish came out to be spicy, but definitely not a 10. The portion was huge. I had a hard time finishing half of it. I'm not an expert on Thai food so I couldn't really tell if it was authentic. The dish was a little too sweet and greasy for me. But it might be that's the way Thai noodles are supposed to be.  My friend had a pad Thai combo. It came out with three chicken skews, a yummy creamy soup with shrimps and veges, and two dumplings. I didn't try his pad Thai since I hate peanuts, but the soup was so tasty! There was so much coconut in it, which I love!! Other than that, the skews were dry. The dumplings were plain. Overall I'm not too impressed with the food.  The ambience was very nice and cozy though. Loved the exotic decor and service was great!",

    "text": "We went to Nicky's for a Saturday afternoon lunch before heading to Homemade Arcade. It was very busy. We were deceived by being seated so quickly...our actual meal took FOREVER once we got to the table. Our waitress was very sweet, but seemed new and not able to answer some questions we had about prices or certain menu items. If you don't know, that's fine, but maybe offer to go ask someone who does instead of just guessing and leaving us no more informed than before! She took our drink order, brought them out and then left us to decide on our meals. I have no idea where she went because it was a REALLY long time before she came back over!  When the food finally came out, it was just ok. We ordered Crab Rangoon as an appetizer and while the flavor was there, the shells were completely soggy which was a huge disappointment. The other server who brought out our food apologized for the delay and thanked us for waiting. I ordered a dish with thin rice noodles, shrimp and veggies in a garlic sauce. It was average. The shrimp wasn't very flavorful and seemed to be thrown on top of the platter rather than seasoned and cooked with it. My boyfriend ordered soft shelled crab and again, the flavor was there but it was another soggy disappointment.   Two dishes that went over well were the green curry and a tofu stir-fry with wide rice noodles and a dark soy sauce. Each order came with thr option of a salad with pineapple dressing or chicken noodle soup. The salad was ok. I had a bite of my friend's soup ans would have preferred that.   It was reasonably priced for lunch, it came to about $15 per person. We got a good portion of food for a god price, so I'd probably give it another try.",

Overall, atmosphere was great and staff was friendly and portions were large. They were not accommodating for broth and spice levels were not accurate.

It turns out, the food was worth it though.  We ordered a mix of things (two types of curry, classic pad thai).  The menu had a good mix of Americanized favorites and some more exotic Thai cuisine.  *Important tip*: they'll ask you what heat level you prefer (1-10).  We sampled 5-7; 6 would be about right for most people, I think.  Head north to 7-8 if you like to sweat a little.  Everything we had was very good.  Nothing to be head-over-heels in love with, but certainly Nicky's is a solid lunch or dinner spot.  Also note, the portions on some dishes are huge.  The pad thai could easily feed three people.",

Food was fairly good, but the menu boards made of stiff, inflexible cardboard were near 14 -15 inch long and one could just foresee that in such crowded situations the tall slim glasses or wine bottle on the already laden table would risk being overturned and possibly cause embarrassment or even injury.  When our party was being seated, (we had reservations for a graduation). asked the young shorter male waiter to wipe some water droplets from a chair. Unbelievably, he tried wiping with his bare hand. Keep in mind this is the same hand used to hold plates of food. When that didn't work he used his apron hem.  During the meal the other taller waiter spilled one of the tall glasses flush unto one of our guests (who could have seen this coming?) and while he attempted to clean it up, no offer to even comp a drink or small side order etc. was  made. (Our bill was almost $300 incl 18% automatic gratuity). Otherwise the ambience was positive.  Further training of the serving staff and possible re-thinking of the impractical menu boards etc. might be a good idea.",

    "text": "Nicky's, one of the staple Thai restaurants that is on everyone's top list of restaurants, has finally moved into their newest space - much to the joy of disinterested downtown diners who were sick of lackluster lunch locations. I had the joy of Nicky's Thai at being only a short walk away, back when I worked on the other side of the river. Now being nowhere near, I would constantly crave food as flavorful and spicy as my old lunch haunt. And It appears I'm not the only one to take notice, the Downtown Nicky's is expectedly packed during the lunch rush - being pretty difficult to get a table between 12:00 and 12:45.  Entering Nicky's, the space is comfortably decorated, but larger and less cozy than the North shore location. As far as I can tell, gone is the beautifully decorated patio which made the atmosphere really shine, I can only detect interior seating here(though I will update if I find out differently). The waiting area upon entering is narrow and sectioned off by some shelves - too small for a party to wait, and barely large enough to wait for your takeout to be brought to the front. This is probably the largest complaint of the place - The second group to arrive and wait for a table will inevitably be waiting between seated people as they dine.  The restaurant is currently BYO if you care for it, though I expect many lunchers can't take full advantage of that option. Dinner-goers, though, will certainly find a downtown BYOB spot nice - but should utilize it while they can.. A full bar is being planned and the fate of BYO is dubious. N/A drinks are standard fare for a thai place - hot tea, coconut water, thai iced tea. The cost here is reasonable, and depends on what protein you select. For lunch, veggie entrees are usually around $8, pork/chicken for $9, beef for $10, shrimp for $11 and mixed seafood for $12.   The menu is quite large,  larger than I remembered at the north shore location. It comes on a two-sided flat board which is grouped into sections like 'Curries', 'Rice', 'Noodles', 'Soup', 'Chef Specialties'. It's difficult to go wrong on the menu, but ordering Thai(or any ethnic cuisine) can be difficult for people, so some of my favorite items are the Green Curry, Red Chili Shrimp, Pad See Eaw, and Spicy Noodles. There are appetizers on the menu, but be aware that each entree comes with a soup(usually chicken and rice) or salad, and a single crab rangoon off to the side. Spiciness is usually requested on the classic scale of 1-10, but I have recently been experimenting with \"Mild/Medium/Hot/Thai Hot\" for a more consistent experience. I always go with 10 or Thai Hot, and unlike the unfortunate Smiling Banana Leaf, Nicky's is not afraid to deliver - It is not for the faint of heart or delicate of palate.   The food is really where Nicky's shines. Fresh and flavorful veggies that are crisp and not mushy, proteins that are full of flavor and cooked to tenderness, and sauces that burst with flavors full of spices and herbs, sweetness and spiciness. Garlic chilies, coconut, ginger, thai basil, and countless other flavors permeate every bite, making each subsequent taste both irresistible and enthralling.  I have gotten takeout here a few times with perfect accuracy(8 entrees with correctly labeled spice levels, protein choices, substitutions/omissions, and soup/salad choices) - but it appears that my penchant for spice may have kicked up everyone else's choices a bit by proxy. Be aware if you're going to order a 10/Thai hot dish to potentially order everyone else's dish a step milder than normal.  In my opinion, if you enjoy ethnic foods, you've found the best dining option in the downtown area. Look no further.  I'm surprised to see so many reviews scolding Nicky's for service before they even get a month under their belt. Initially you could tell they were understaffed at the lunch hour - but I would expect nothing less from a brand new restaurant, especially in a difficult-to-plan downtown lunch area. There now appear to be more servers and the last time I came into the restaurant around 12:50 there were plenty of open tables - so I'll assume they've been fitting meals into a standard lunch hour.",

    "text": "Having enjoyed the Western Ave restaurant, I was thrilled to walk by and see Nicky's on Penn and Ninth. Wow, they are so not ready for business.   We were seated with Lunch menus (at dinner time - we thought perhaps this site had lunch on one side & dinner on the other side so didn't ask) and not asked if we wanted anything to drink - I called the waitress back to request water and ginger tea. Someone else asked if we wanted appetizers, which were listed on the Lunch side, so after a moment of confused hesitation, we asked for the tofu with spinach & peanut sauce (okay).   It wasn't until I asked if the curries on the lunch menu were available that they said we had the wrong menus, handed us dinner menus, and then stood there, as if we would be ready to instantly order off the huge dinner menu we hadn't yet read. At that point, with more/different options, we realized there was a different appetizer we would have preferred. I asked about the wild versus green mango curry, was advised to go with the green mango curry, and then was delivered plain mango curry. They admitted the mistake when they came to the table - when I asked what type of curry the mango curry was, the waiter said it's the same as the green curry only without the green color. Hmm. I am happy to try anything, and my friend's dinner was there of course, but I should have insisted they switch it for the correct dish. What I got had no flavor at all other than the hot pepper - and no ingredients other than mango and fried tofu (I'd specifically asked about the vegetables in the other curry dishes, so their absence was unwelcome). I'd asked for a 7 - it made my nose run a little, but I could discern no actual curry taste. I asked for some steamed broccoli to put in, which they brought, but it was mushy - and I still could not taste curry when I soaked the florets. Very odd. I should have sent the dish back and asked for something else - especially since they charged full price for their mistake (and I did not eat even half of the dish - and did not take any to go). They did not offered, even when they saw I wasn't eating the plain mango curry, whether I wanted the green mango curry entree I had ordered (though, at that point, we needed to get going anyway).  Very very disappointed with the service and food.",

The decor is really nice and I love that the food come in these golden goblet-like vessels - Makes you kind of feel like royalty. The staff is great.

I was recommended to try Nicky's where I was pleasantly greeted by the hosts in a small and very cozy environment.  The amount of people inside and the atmosphere really set the tone for a great meal, I felt.  I know these things don't play into the food being good or bad but when I think of my favorite Thai Restaurants, Nicky's felt like part of that group simply based on appearance and atmosphere.  I ordered the Duck Curry at a 10 spice level (along with a local brew) and was given a very large bowl filled with duck, pineapple chunks, cashews, and plenty of other ingredients that flavored the curry to perfection.  I mixed in my white rice and dug in.  The Curry was incredible.  The spice was perfect for my taste, the duck was well cooked, and the pineapple chunks burst with flavor every time I bit into one.  The portion size was certainly enough to fill me up as I unfortunately even had to leave some behind.    While I can't say for certainty if Nicky's is the best Thai I have had, I can say it is within the top three.  I would put this toe to toe with my favorite places in New York and LA.  I was very, very impressed.",

The sticky rice that they microwaved then placed in foil to appear fresh like it was in the oven? I could have thrown the rice through a car window it was that hard. We almost cried trying to eat.

It was 10000k better than what i had at nikkis.  We spent over 100 for the 4 of us with tip. Very disappointed. Too much hype.

You want it to hug your mouth with flavor on a cold day... not remind you of the flavors your taste buds can't find. Like kissing an old boyfriend you thought your feelings would return and then.... Nothing but little shreds of disappointment.   So why three stars? I've eaten at Nicky's other times and the service is excellent also a second dish I'm reviewing here fared a bit better than my lacking Massaman.   Room for improvement: I couldn't taste the hints of tamarind, cinnamon, garlic or nutmeg or mace. Which should be key stars of the paste. My meal was prepped and brought to me fast but also means it probably was in part pre made. The results were more of a generic salt peanut tasting sauce. More of something I've had on satay.   They used dry red pepper in the sauce which is fine for the paste but it lowers the hot spice flavor. Using oil or fresh red pepper will fix that fast. In addition to the dried pepper I ordered it at a 7 spice level but personally it felt like a 4 or 5 tops. I do not eat spicy food often so my tolerance is not high.   The better dish -- my boyfriend's pumpkin tofu curry was a better bet and really I think Nicky's pleases better with its non traditional dishes. The pumpkin was soft and sauce a nice middle between sweet and spicy. Sadly the spice level was missing like a thief in the night..... No sweat beads made an appearance. The tofu was chewy but not underdone which is a tofu fear of mine ( texture fears).   Overall it's gorgeous in here and you get about 4 inches more elbow room than the Western st location. You also can eat without a reservation at 5 if you can be done eating by 630. The prices are decent for portion size... Service is prompt polite and they will offer more rice if you need it. I think I'll try some other dishes and hope for a better outcome next time.",

The downtown spot is conveniently located near the Cultural District, so it's a great place to grab dinner before a show (and they do take reservations, which I advise that you make if you're doing that).  On our most recent visit, we started with the creamiest crab rangoons of all time, along with a plate of their steamed dumplings. They have a full bar as well, so we got some Pinot Grigio (which for some reason has become my Official Wine of Thai and Sushi). They truly have enough appetizers and small plates on the menu that you could make this a tapas adventure if you wanted to.  For entrees, we both got the spicy noodles (mine with pork, husband's with beef). The noodles are wide but thing, perfectly cooked with napa cabbage (those big chunks of cabbage) in the spicy basil sauce.  And remember: Nicky's is *real* Thai spicy. So what you might be accustomed to ordering as a medium, is actually a mild here. And if you're used to ordering your Thai food 'hot,' well... be prepared to sweat. The first time I went to Nicky's (with my fellow Yelp buddies Linda W. & Rachel C.), we all truly underestimated how spicy the food would be, and spent our entrees crying, sniffling, and saying, 'oh god this is sooooooo goooooood'.  The space is beautiful, although it can feel a bit crowded during the busy times when they're at capacity. They are quite generous with refills on your water (thank goodness, with all that spice!).  However, there's still something that just seems a little disorganized about the service. All of the servers are incredibly polite, friendly, and welcoming. Things just seem to take a little bit longer than we should. At our most recent visit, we were greeted immediately, but prior to us being able to look over the drink menu. So we said, 'Just one minute please,' which turned into almost 10.  Regardless, we'll certainly be back to Nicky's. The food is so flavorful, and the room is so pleasant. We'll just be sure we make our reservations for a little earlier so we have time to enjoy the meal and make our show.",

The presentation was very nice and the atmosphere was also great, but the flavor was lacking overall.",

We were a group of eleven. Speaking of Eleven, that restaurant on Smallman Street looks totally pretentious. Don't go there. Come to Nicky's!  I ordered the green mango curry tofu dish. We also got vegetarian dumplings, a hotpot of Tom Yum soup, and I tried the spicy green bean tofu. My green curry was on point as expected. Green curry is the best curry, even though you may temporarily stink up the hotel bathroom the following morning. The flavors were so complex.  One of my relatives mentioned his green curry chicken was too spicy (the minimum spice level for the green curry is 3 out of 10). Beware if you can't handle the spice.  The dumpling was exquisite. It looked cute.  The soup was somewhat sour, but I don't really mind. It came with tofu and mushrooms that my cousins didn't eat because they're picky.  The Singha beers cost $4.",

Not spicy at all and the flavor of the noodles were great.  Only complaint I have is that the chicken was a little dry and not flavorful, kind of reminded me of the chicken you get from Chinese takeout.  The pad Thai itself made up for that.

All were good but the crab rangoon could have been the best I have ever eaten. We each got our own entrees, I had the Salmon Mango Curry - Grilled salmon, slice fresh mango, pea carrot stir-fried mix vegetable basil leaves, topped with green curry sauce. It was very delicious. I tried to save room for dessert but ate the whole thing. My friend had the pumpkin curry and would recommend that dish as well. Nicky's is BYOB, which made the evening even more pleasurable.   Definitely give Nicky's a try when in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Let me be clear, the food is good here. That's said I WOULD NEVER RETURN. I advise you to at least skim through this as a discretionary tale should you visit.  I went with a group of 6 and we were told over the phone the restaurant was BYOB. Between 6 of us we had brought two bottles of wine and some beer. While waiting about 15 minutes for glasses for wine I opened a few beers for the table with my OWN bottle opener and we had them from the bottle (no glasses ever came for beer). After the wine glasses finally arrived the ladies opened their first bottle and poured the wine.  About 5 minutes later a server who spoke better English came by to say that each open wine bottle would be 10 dollars for a corking fee and each beer would be 2 dollars.  The beer is ridiculous but the wine is a common practice... if you tell your patrons the fee exists beforehand. Either way we figured it was just 10 bucks so we would just let them know they should tell future guests about the fee in advance.  At this point the server began to try and tell us that she already said this when she brought the glasses over ( she didn't bring the glasses a gentleman did and she came about 5 minutes later). We got the manager over to the table to let him know and she then proceeded to say she never said beer costed money and I should forget she said it... At this point I realized she was willing to lie to our faces. We began to ignore her and speak only with the manager who said it would be 10 dollars flat for all drinks at the table including the remaining bottle of wine the girls had not opened yet.  Fast forward 15 minutes the girls opened their second bottle. Instantly the snarky server walked by and said \"ha that's another 10\".  You can imagine my frustration at this immaturity by this point. The manager returned and said he never said the fee was a flat rate for the table (which I clarified twice prior to him walking away), and said it was another 10 for the new bottle open. Needless to say after some discussion, we did NOT pay another corking fee. I truly have NEVER had such a negative experience at a restaurant, and all over 10 dollars. Shame on this restaurant for having terrible service. You have certainly lost 6 customers and hopefully at least others will beware if choosing to visit here. Just sad.",

    "text": "Less than a month after eating at their North Side location I had the chance to eat at Nicky's downtown. I actually like their downtown location even more than the other one. Like its sister location it features cool themed decor and offers the same calm and welcoming atmosphere (and quiet places to eat downtown are VERY welcome in my book!). Unlike the North Side restaurant, which is small and cozy, this place had plenty of room to seat a decent number of people indoors. In fact it was the perfect place to reserve dinner for a group of 10 people after a Symphony show, and we were all able to speak with each other without shouting over loud music or anything like that during our meal. Two BIG thumbs up just for that!  And of course, their food is as fantastic here as it is at their other location. A friend and I split their samosa appetizer - it was quite sweet and tasty - and I ordered the Param Chicken. When the food came out my rice was on the side, where I could mix it in with my food as I wished (a nice touch). You can also pick the spice level you want in your dishes - I stuck to a measly two, while another friend got the eye-watering 10. He's a braver person than I am! Everyone enjoyed the food immensely in my group. However there wasn't a rangoon with every meal, which I observed during my last visit to Nicky's - maybe that's a North Side/lunch only kind of deal?  I definitely have to send out a major thank you to the staff for taking such good care of my group - 10 people is not a small group and the attentiveness we received was impressive and very appreciated. Also, a word of notice: they called to confirm my reservation a couple hours before dinner, at which time I was in a Symphony show. Luckily I turned my phone on in intermission and got their message, so I was able to call back and confirm that we'd have our table. So if you're going to eat here after a show, keep this potential call in mind and be ready to take it or call them back.   Overall I think this place can be summed up in six words: great service, great food, great place. Nicky's, I'll be back soon so I can sample some soup and more appetizers!",

So that had me looking forward to lunch with a friend that flew from California, as I was hungry and she  was too.  She wanted healthy meal and we decided to walk down the street from the hotel (Courtyard Marriott) we were staying at.    We got to Nicky's Thai Kitchen around 1:15 pm and there were still other people waiting for seats.  Place was full!!   But after only a short wait, we were brought to our table.  Service was good.  Reason for not 5 was I had specifically said I was a wuss for hot spicy food.  I ordered the green curry and it was delicious, a slight slow burn on tongue.  Portion size was huge. I got to box my leftovers and give to my friend.   Lots of nice appropriate photos and stuff on the wall brought authenticity here.  The price was very reasonable.  I was expecting to spend a bit more since it was downtown.  Our waiter saw me taking a photo and offered to take one of us together.  Overall experience, food and service were very good.  I'm sure they could have kicked up the heat on spice more but as I mentioned, my \"I don't like hot\" had a mild but I'd prefer none.",

    "text": "Nicky's is one of my favorite Thai places in the Pittsburgh area, if not my favorite.  However I think I am partial to the North Side location, even though the Downtown location is bigger and newer looking.  We came here on a Saturday evening right before Christmas.  It wasn't too busy and we were quickly seated.  One thing I love about Nicky's is you usually never have to wait for service.  Someone is always coming over to fill your water or bring you this or that, so I was slightly disappointed in our server that evening.  As she disappeared a lot so we had to ask other servers/workers again for the items we initially asked her for.  We started with our favorite appetizer, fresh spring rolls with tofu.  I always ask for the carousel of death (just a sassy name I have for the trio of dry and wet chilies they bring if requested to ramp up the spice in your dish).  We ordered our meals at the same time.  I went with the Phad See Eaw with tofu Thai hot.    A little time passes and a different lady delivered our appetizer without the additional chilies I asked for and chopsticks that I had also requested at the time of my order.  No big deal for me but I think the food runner was probably a bit annoyed like these things just occurred to me.  She brings my requested items and we thoroughly enjoyed the rolls.  I always mix a little spice into the peanut sauce or skip the peanut sauce altogether and just use the chili spice.  I dipped my roll into the spooned pile of chili sauce and popped it in my mouth.  Sweet Lord these chilies were potent.  As usual the rolls were great.  Our meals were delivered, again by someone who was not our server.  I asked for more water something you usually don't have to do.  Being very hungry I jumped right in anticipating I would have to adjust the spice levels using the carousel.  Yes I sure did have to adjust it, the other way that is.  This was definitely the spiciest Thai hot I ever had.  It did not ruin my dish but I will not lie the next day I was hurting a little.  My noodles were nicely sliced and not gummy, but I found the tofu to be spongy.  I was disappointed in that especially since I've come to expect more from Nicky's.  Our server stayed MIA until it was time to deliver the check. We asked for a box and I think someone else even brought that.  Choppy night but we do love Nickys and we will be back.",

I ordered the Green Curry with Tofu, which came with a choice of soup or salad to start. I ordered the salad, which came with a sweet chili dressing (which was wayyyyy too sweet). For my curry, the menu said the spice level was on a scale of 1-10, so I ordered a 3. However after I ordered, the person next to me was ordering, and the waiter told him the spice level was on a scale of 1-5. Needless to say, my food had a bigger kick to it than I was expecting, but it was still great. The tofu was a little bland, but the veggies and green curry sauce were delicious.  While the service was a little slow because of how crowded the restaurant was, the prices were incredibly affordable, and the portions were large.",

We've had their noodle dishes and curries in the past as well as their apps and soups, but the noodles are just my favorite as you'll get plenty of protein along with the noodles, which are always cooked perfectly!  GREAT cocktails as well and the bartender is open to making something you like that's not on the menu.  It can get very crowded on the weekends and it's NOT a large place, so be prepared to wait out on the street for a bit.  My only knock is that it's very warm in there...whew...and for an older lady like me that can be a problem :-)",

Every time I've visited has been for dinner, but being that it's walking distance from my job I'd love to come here for lunch, too.  The first time I came to Nicky's was with my boyfriend for dinner, and we started with an order of the crispy egg rolls. It was decently busy, but service was quick. We ate our appetizer super quick and were so excited for our dinners. Judging by how good our appetizer was, we knew our dinner was something to look forward to. I got the chicken Phad Thai, and he went with the pumpkin curry with chicken thighs. Not going to lie, the Pad Thai was a little underwhelming, but still tasted good. Phad Thai is obviously noodle-based, but there wasn't much else to the dish. My boyfriend's pumpkin curry, however, was something special. It was so delicious, and the pumpkin flavor was just enough without being overwhelming. It went incredibly well with the chicken thigh, and all of that was served with rice on the side. They do charge $2.95 for extra rice, and from my experience we've always needed extra rice when ordering a curry dish.  Onto my next visit! On the day before Thanksgiving, my boyfriend and I had some family visiting from out of town, and we decided to get together for dinner here. Two of our visitors are vegetarian so we figured this would be a great option being that there are plenty of tofu dishes on the menu. We started with an order of spring rolls, which I loved the freshness of. My boyfriend ordered one of the fish dishes, and I got the chili mango tofu. My dish tasted fantastic, but my two complaints with it are that they were stingy with the tofu and the mangoes were hard and crunchy, as if they weren't quite ripe yet. Aside from that it was good, though.  Our most recent visit to Nicky's was the best one yet. My brother was super picky growing up, but decided that he wanted to try Thai food for the first time. He got the mango curry with chicken, my boyfriend got a steak special, and I got the spicy basil eggplant with tofu. It was disappointing that they only brought out 2 bowls of rice for the 3 of us to share, because we had to pay the $2.95 for extra rice even though all of our dishes are supposed to come with it. When you eat curry you definitely need a good amount of rice to go with it. This time with my dish they were way more generous than the last time with the tofu, and the eggplant was delicious. My boyfriend's steak special came with two fried eggs on top and tons of veggies, and he also enjoyed his dish! We'll definitely be visiting Nicky's again, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for some great Thai grub!",

Apparently our friend isn't the only one who loves the food here...  It is very loud in here, like so loud you are almost shouting across the table to make conversation. It is also pretty cramped so if you're claustrophobic I'd pass! Lol  To change things up and pass on the dumplings we decided to try the Thai Toasts for our appetizer. How cute and interesting they were. Cut into little triangles, the mixture of pork and spices was added to toast and were deep fried,served in 8 pieces, and came with a cucumber dipping sauce. It is deceiving when you see it, looks like water but tastes like a sweet n sour sauce. It was the perfect addition to the crispy toasts.  The food took quite awhile to get to us but was worth the wait. I had the Sweet Chili Mango Tilapia and my husband had the Terriyaki Chicken. He actually wanted the Crispy version from the menu that was outside the restaurant, but clearly he did not get that one, just the regular chicken terriyaki. Not a big deal, but, nonetheless.   Mine came with a very large piece of battered and fried tilapia, surrounded by various veggies, rice and the sweet chili sauce. Husbands entree was in essence the same as mine, just replace the fish with the chicken. The serving sizes are very appropriate and I did notice a lot of people leaving with to go bags so you do get your money's worth here. No military discount.",

By far the best meal I had while in Pittsburgh. Probably some of the best Thai food I have ever had.   We had the Panang Curry and the Pad Thai Combo. To be honest, the chicken was a bit overcooked but its tough to make chicken that isn't overcooked in boiling fluid. But the flavor is on point. The pad thai was delicious. The chicken skewers was out fo this world - by far the best thing on the plate.   Also a really pleasant surprise was the Thai green tea. Not too sweet but tons of flavor.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",

The duck was sliced and not too fatty. If I were sharing, I would definitely say it was light on the duck. Sticky rice and it was a lovely dish! I got a mix of ginger and green hot tea.   I polished off the room temp leftovers in my hotel room. Still good!   Lunch service wasn't busy, so I would expect no mistakes on the order and more attentive service, but otherwise, it was an enjoyable meal. Though, $27 for an entree, sticky rice and tea (incl. tip)?

It was definitely sweetened with the pineapple chunks, use of pineapple juice in the sauce, and addition of raisins but I really enjoyed it. During our recent trip, I ordered the Thai Style Fried Rice with chicken, onions, peas, carrots, and of course, the fried rice! I ordered the mild-medium spice level which is just enough for me. The portion sizes are huge and could serve me for three meals! I really enjoyed my meal and the development of flavors. Their entrees run from $14-$18 but the size you receive is definitely worth the price.   The inside of the restaurant is really small and decorated based on the culture. We sat at the bar to wait for our take out and the bartender served us water. The food came out faster than expected and we were on our way.  I have no doubt we will be back here, if not for a sit down meal, for take-out!",

    "text": "I absolutely love the North side location. Friendly servers and amazing food. This is my first time at the downtown location. So because my love of Nicky's food has been long standing, I feel bad for writing this review. However the service completely ruined my experience at this location. The food was amazing just like the other restaurant and was made in good time. The main difference that stuck out compared to other Thai restaurants is they use a 5 point spice scale rather than 10. Our server came to our table twice. Once to take our order probably after 15 minutes of waiting for someone to come and then again to bring our check. He didn't even introduce himself I had to ask what his name was before we left, turns out it was Aaron. My friend with me had to raise her hand to get him to pay attention to our table. We were going to stay longer and have more drinks after just one beer but it wasn't worth the wait. Never had such a bad waiter. He was quick to assist some other tables.   Normally in a restaurant the staff at some point, even if it's just the waiter, thanks you for coming etc, nope. I said thank you to him for bringing back our receipts and he literally said \"you're welcome\" and walked away. The most he did was take our order and take our checks. Barely said a word to us. Never checked if we needed anything. A machine could have done better. Just flabbergasted at the poor server/customer skills because the manager wasn't any better.   My friend had plastic bag particles in her dish to which we brought it to the managers attention and all she said was \"are you ok?\" Then walked away. It didn't ruin the food but that wasn't the point. Just the careless demeanor and service outweighs the taste of the food. I'll gladly return to north side but never this location. The best thing is probably the decoration and atmosphere. Beautiful deco and dim lighting. But as I said, nothing can overcome the poor service. If they could work on that, it'd be a better place. I must add it wasn't even busy.",

    "text": "Excellent Thai food. Turns out our server was from Bangkok and we spoke with him a bit about our travels to Thailand. He was very curious about how the food was in comparison and I'd say that this place is very close to authentic Thai food. In fact, the pad thai (which I haven't had in a long time), was better than some of the street food versions of this dish  consumed in Thailand.  So yes - the Pad Thai is an excellent choice - it has a slight kick with just the right amount of sweet and salt. It's a bit oilier than other versions of the noodle dish, but it works...the oil gives it more moisture. Chicken satay was delicious and the green curry was terrific. The only thing that was odd about the curry: the chicken took on the color...it was green. I've never seen green chicken before...so that threw me off a bit.  Mixed drinks were nice; they had a few specials and I tried the Mango Sangria (with red wine; there's a choice of red or white). Went down easy and fast.  Thankfully we arrived before the rush. By the time we left, there weren't any tables available.",

HUGE variety of Thai flavors on the menu, nice vegan and seafood options (I'm not a big meat eater), and very accommodating service. I love the purple, chewy earthy flavored whole grain rice that soaks up the deliciousness of the various curries. I love the yummy comfort of the Tom Yum soup, the freshness of the fresh rolls, and the crab fried rice is AMAZING. Even if you are not a dessert person you MUST try the mango with the sticky rice, especially if you've never had it before! It's also a great place to take a fancy date as the fancy decor will make your partner feel like a prince or princess.",

We started with crab rangoon, which was excellent. It's nice to have the house-made version rather than the big-box Chinese fast food version!  I tried a catfish dish (can't quite remember the name because their online menu is slightly different from what I actually saw in the restaurant). It was good, although I'm not sure I'd get it again. I know that doesn't make sense haha! Their spiciness scale is just a pinch hotter than I had expected, so my 7 was a little beyond my comfort zone as someone who enjoys spicy food.  The space is a little cramped, like there are two or three too many tables in the space. The servers are always getting in each other's way, and it was difficult to maneuver back out of the place. But that's a minor detail.  This will definitely be a stop for us before events downtown!",

I'd been hearing about Nicky's Thai for some time but never managed to make the trek to the North Side for it. So much easier to settle for mediocre (on a good day) Thai from somewhere closer to home in Squirrel Hill. We tried the new-ish downtown location of Nicky's Thai last night and it was by far the best Thai food I have had in a very, very, very long time. Quite possibly the best I've had outside of Thailand or cities with decent-sized Thai populations and some great Thai restaurants (e.g., Sydney).  We of course ordered far too much food and left feeling happy and full. The portions are pretty big. The problem is that they are so tasty that you do feel compelled to over indulge. But that's okay when it is so delicious, I suppose.  Nicky's Thai is a great little place downtown and is worth checking out. Delicious!",

I have to say, the food was everything I'd heard it was.  Flavorful, fresh, beautifully prepared and perfectly delicious.  Clearly Nicky's knows how make their dining customers happy when it comes to Thai cuisine.  A solid 4 stars there definitely. And they are definitely gluten-free friendly...big plus there.  My standard for Thai is always Green Curry.  This time I ordered it with chicken.  Big pieces of soft eggplant, crisp snowpeas, al dente green beans, peas, carrots, big pieces of broccoli enveloped in a sweet and hot (I ordered it HOT) green curry kissed with coconut satisfied every expectation I have of that lovely dish.  It came with a choice of soup or salad.  Salad it was.  Iceberg lettuce was graced with a pineapple peanut dressing that I think I could put on everything and be happy.  It was beautiful.  That is, when it finally arrived at the table.  Let me detail the lowlights of the visit.  The service is abysmal.  Does it sound like I'm overstating how bad it was?  Nope.  The three of us waited and waited until finally we stopped a server to ask where the salads were.  Immediately the salads appeared on the table.  Were they waiting at the pass simply to be picked up and delivered?    Entrees?  Same slooooooooowwwww experience, but with a new twist.  After an extended time my dining companions got their entrees.  The assumption was made that mine would arrive next.  And it did....10-15 minutes later and only after (again) asking the server.  Some major improvements need to be made in the service area.  Do they need more than 2 servers?  You betcha!  The place was crammed with diners!  There were potential diners out the door waiting for tables to open up.    Unfortunately, the service doesn't come close to the food.  I'm hoping it's just a matter of finding their sea legs and the service issues will clear themselves up quickly.  If not, those lines out the door will disappear quickly...downtown diners mostly have a lunch HOUR to abide by.  PLEASE, Nicky's, let the service match the quality of the food soon.  The only reason there are 3 stars instead of 2 is because the food is SO blasted good! Fingers crossed that next time the review will be stellar for BOTH!",

    "text": "I am absolutely thrilled by this edition to downtown.   The Penn Avenue area was in desperate need of some more restaurants and I'm even happier that it was a Thai restaurant and is providing some food variety.   Apparently everyone else in Pittsburgh is just as excited as I am because I can't manage to find a time during the lunch hour when there isn't a wait!   I've gone at 11:30, noon and 12:30 and stood in line every time.   I guess there are worse problems to have though!  Every time I've gone here (except my first visit), I've gotten the spicy noodles.   I almost tried something new the last time but then I asked the waiter which of the two options he recommended and he said spicy noodles, so my consistent choice now feels validated.  I will warn you that the spicy noodles are very spicy.   There are some dishes here, where you can order an 8 or 9 and say, eh that wasn't too spicy but the spicy noodles isn't one of them.  I'd stick with a 6 or 7 the first time (assuming you like some heat).   You won't be disappointed!",

I have been to hundreds of Thai places without fish sauce and nothing is lacking.  Ditch the fish and 5 stars is within reach.",

    "text": "We now have a great downtown Thai restaurant!  We've been there twice and it was really great both times. Last night we had the seafood tam ka soup with a coconut base and a beautiful mix of vegetables and textures spices and heat.   Have to pause to comment on the heat. We love spicy food, and this place will make some seriously spicy food. They have mild, medium, spicy and Thai. We got the soup \"spicy\" and it was really hot.  Not so hot that it blew away the other flavors, but definitely pushed us right to the edge (which I personally like in a first course). I'd recommend that most of our friends who don't enjoy the pleasure/pain of beautifully spicy Thai food should stick to \"medium\".   Main courses were spicy tofu eggplant which was really nicely done, with fresh tofu that was in strips not little cubes, which made it hold the sauce like a pasta, and nicely smooth eggplant. I had a barbecued chicken on skewers served with a really nice vegetable slaw with spicy lime juice Thai fish sauce. Ordered it medium and it was great, the chicken was like tandoori , a little smoky and tender. I'd definitely order it again   They don't have a liquor license at this point, and (I'm surprised to to be saying this) it did not matter at all.   The decor is really nice, one of my favorites, and a very nice place to take guests when you want them to think downtown is pretty cool.   Not cheap, but not expensive,  all combined we have a great new downtown thai place, a new go to choice. Go, keep them in business, they deserve it!",

The True gem here for me is the Massaman Curry - delightfully peanut-buttery with great consistency and tons of flavor. The service was spot on, and the ambiance pleasant, if maybe a little on the loud side.   ... and the serving dishes made me feel like a KING.",

After being seated, she gave our group some complimentary Crab Rangoon for the wait. She asked us to order, we got another appetizer, and the food was out very quickly after finishing our 2nd appetizer.   I had the Pumpkin Curry, and it was delicious, and a lot of food. I brought it home the next day and ate it for lunch, and it was still so delicious.   I'm excited to go back to this place. I'm excited to try as much of their food as I can.",

Went early for lunch around 1140 and got right in.  Staff could have been a little more attentive...  it took 5-10 minutes to get our menus and water, but the food more than made up for it.  Pork red curry and jalepeno chicken slathered in their assortment of hot oils and dressings can't be overlooked if you like your stuff spicy.  Definitely will be going back again.  Update (second visit):  Went to Nicky's for a second lunch with the fiancee after I ranted and raved to her about the food.  Still rather good, however the service was extremely sub-par.  On both occasions its been hard to ask for input about the menu, and this time, it apparently landed me with an entree completely different than what I ordered.  The real issue came when I brought it to my servers attention and she accused me of being wrong.  I'm torn because I truly do love the food, but on two occasions now, the service has been below expectations.  I'll probably give it a third try and strike option as I still need to try the pad thai.",

The basil chicken and red curry noodle were good.  They have plenty of classic thai dishes and large portion sizes!  Price point was very reasonable at 10-15$ for most dinner entrees.

I said I would order something else.  She then told me that all of the curry dishes contain shrimp powder.  All of them?!?!  So then I moved on to another section of the menu, and ordered a vegetarian staple.  Menu said it had black soy sauce.  Server tells me no, it's actually oyster sauce!  Wtf.  I think I finally got it on the third or fourth try.  Food came out very fast, considering we got the last table during a very busy  (and loud) lunch rush.  It was very good.  I had to deduct a star for the menu not disclosing the additional ingredients.  I actually worry just as much for people with fish allergies, they would really have no way to tell.",

They have a rather small restaurant, and during the lunch hours it can get fairly packed.  The restaurant is tactfully decorated to match it's ethnic background.    The menu here is fairly simple with some basic but creative dishes.  My favorite by far has been the spicy basil fried rice with chicken.  It is spot on with some vegetables and rice as well as having a good amount of kick to it.  If you aren't a huge fan of heat, you can choose to have a lower heat level for any dish.  Last time I was here, my wife ordered pineapple rice with chicken.  She thoroughly enjoyed it which had some sizable chunks of pineapple and other vegetables.  The only complaint I would have is I've noticed a less than ideal amounts of chicken in the dishes.  Other than that, the portion typically is more than a single meal.  This is a cool place to have some good Thai food.  If you are nervous about trying Thai, but enjoy rice dishes, this will be a great place to start! I've also had their pad Thai here and it was extremely excellent.  Not a bad price for a downtown meal and their service, food, and staff has been very consistent.",

The decor is unique and classy, with a lot of Asian-themed gold and bejeweled items adorning the walls. The interior is relaxed, clean, and comfortable. We were able to charge our phones.  Service is friendly and prompt.   The portions are heaping and generous. I had trouble finishing my meal!  On both visits, I had the beef Pad Phet. I had it made to spicy level 8 the first time, and 7 the second time. I have a very high tolerance for spicy food and still found it to be quite spicy, so keep this in mind if you are sensitive to spicy food!  My boyfriend had the Glass Noodle salad on our first visit and raved about it. On our second visit, he had the Pepper Steak special, which I sampled. It was better than any pepper steak dish I had ever eaten, and it comes with a fried egg on top. It was cooked to the lowest spiciness level (4), but was not anything most people can't handle.   Their wine selection is basic, which is not an issue for me, because I found that their white wines are drinkable and simple - most people who already like white wine would probably find them enjoyable.  They also have a selection of liquor. I am not sure what beers they carry.  I can say with certainty that if and when we return to Pittsburgh, we will be eating here again! The place fills up fast for dinner, so I recommend arriving right as they are opening at 5 PM.",

I got the fried egg rolls, spicy basil fried rice with tofu and a Thai iced tea and it was all ridiculously good! The egg rolls looked to be spiced with turmeric inside and were yellow. Crispy to perfection and came with a pineapple dipping sauce which I thought was unique from other Thai places dipping sauce. The spicy basil fried rice was very good as well. I asked for it at a medium spice level and I am Indian and can handle crazy spicy and this was perfectly nice and spicy. It is a True Thai spice level I would say so if you are worried about spice levels, maybe start with mild. Love this place and will be back here again soon! Highly recommend going!",

These were delicious. For the main course I got pumpkin curry with chicken and it was great. My wife got a grilled duck curry. She said the duck didnt appear to be grilled, but she loved it.  The interior here is beautiful and our waitress was attentive and kind.  Great place! I shall return.",

    "text": "Hands down the best Thai food in the city! Someone who is from Thailand recommended this restaurant, and I wanted to visit it from so long. We went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and boy, we were all pleased.  First of all the ambiance of this place is great! They have these golden sculptures, and sort of bronze bells hung all around. Transported me back to the feel of a Buddhist monastery! The place seemed rather busy even for a weekday evening. Reservations are probably a must for weekends. The service was great, the waiter was extremely courteous.  I can't even get started on the food! There are so many options, that we took a lot of time to decide. For appetizers, we ordered the Chicken Wings (with basil sauce). It was incredible. What we loved was that it came with a lots of side salad, and had a nice flavor to it. We were curious about the samosas in a Thai restaurant so we ordered it. It was basically sweet potato samosas, and tasted sweet and really unique. We also ordered the Thai iced tea, nothing phenomenal there, but decent enough.  For the entrees, we ordered the green curry and trust me, this is  the best curry I have ever eaten :) I loved the way they presented the food in golden colored cutlery :) We had the Garprow Chicken Lad Kao, which is basically an egg, minced and flavored chicken over a bed of rice.   Overall, I am definitely coming here again and recommending the place to friends.",

The hostess said they recently took over the spot next door to expand so I guess I had just missed it since it used to be smaller.  To be fair, the corner location was formerly a candy shop so I was probably just interested in that.   I decided to go for an appetizer and soup (Satay Chicken and Wonton Soup). It was definitely enough to fill me up. The chicken was served as 5 skewers with two dipping sauces and 2 (very dry and tasteless) rice cakes. I would have loved to choose the sauces as the cucumber one was kind of plain. Luckily, the peanut sauce was delicious.   The staff was courteous and attentive. Somehow, even on a Friday night with no reservations, we were seated right away and were served quickly.   I will definitely visit again. One of my friends had the pad thai and I'd like to give that a try.",

Especially when it's not busy, I'd expect at least someone to come check to make sure everything is OK and to my liking. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case!  The ONLY time someone checked on anything was when the guy asked to clear two of my plates. When asked, I told him the salad and fried rice was good, but the summer rolls....NOT!  Tick tock tick tock! It's great that the employee is wearing gloves, but when you go in-and-out of your pocket (to retrieve your phone and headphones, while ignoring the customer).....the gloves are no longer clean OR sanitary. Swap them out!!!! I bet they expect a better tip too.  Would I return, probably at some point. It's close to my apartment at the Pennsylvanian!  Food: 4 Ambience: 4 Service: 1 Sanitation: 2",

Then when I sheepishly admit that I didn't make a reservation, I'm treated like a 5th class citizen that is borishly disrespectfully dining culture. This restaurant was no exception to that rule.   The menu is standard Thai, but makes no notation about what is vegetarian or gluten free.   I'd avoid or look for another restaurant.",

Food wasn't the best Thai food I've had, it was good but pretty average. I got the masaman curry with tofu and both the potatoes and the tofu in the dish were huge and unmanageable to eat. I also thought that the dishes it was served in were cute, but looked as though they would be difficult if not impossible to properly sanitize which worried me a little. Our server was attentive, but also seemed to be in a huge hurry to get us in and out of the restaurant quickly.

We were able to get a seat in the bar area right away, even though they were packed. The place is decked out with elaborate Thai paraphernalia and has an over the top, almost campy, vibe. It's not elegant, but really fun!  Our server was also bartending but was totally on top of it. The whole staff was really attentive and prompt.   We ordered the chef's special soft shell crab curry and the pad see ew with tofu. The pad see ew, a dish with wide flat rice noodles, was definitely the best I've ever had. They were flavorful without falling into the common pitfall of being super greasy. The spice mix was out of this world and made the tofu taste fantastic. Fresh yummy broccoli too.   My partner's crab curry was decadent and buttery, with a variety of fresh veggies, including some really good spring onions.   Prices are definitely higher than most Thai restaurants, but it's worth it for the quality and huge portions. I was stuffed after eating 50% of my entree.",

    "text": "We made a reservation for Saturday night and I'm happy we did because there seemed to be a lot of people wanting to be seated. We arrived a few minutes early and they sat us right away, sweet!   I was very excited to come here because I've read so many mixed vegan reviews and I decided I had to find out for myself. One review said they fry everything in fish oil, they told me they use vegetable because of course I asked. Then another review mentioned they had a lot of vegan options, so I also asked and it seemed you can pick anything on the menu and they will take out the animal products to suit your needs.   Our server was very helpful and knew exactly what needed to be taken out of each dish in order for it to be perfect for me. My husband also needed a little help ordering and she lead him in the right direction.   So for an appetizer we had the Gra-rie Puff, which she assured us was vegan. It was so tasty! Light and crispy dough with a sweet potato filling, the other filling I think was onion based. They were delicious and the dipping sauce was great too.   For my entree I had, Pad See Ew, the server mentioned a few things that would be taken off in order for it to be vegan, no oyster or fish sauce and no eggs. They also added more veggies for me! It was decent, I was obviously scared hoping it truly was vegan. I purposely waited to write this review to see if I got a stomach ache. I actually did get a little weary/upset stomach later that evening. Maybe it was the spice? But, I'm also used to eating really spicy. I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt because they seemed so proactive in making it vegan friendly.   My husband had the spicy noodle with chicken and a level 4, he loved it!   Our friend had Pad Thai with Shrimp and another had Graprow Tofu Lad Kao, the both loved it!   Overall, I would go back and try the food again and give it another try. The atmosphere was nice and it seems like everyone of the servers helped each other which was really nice! We never had empty waters or drinks. They cleared plates as soon as we were finished, I love that!",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Nicky's and would have liked to have tried one of their curries, however, my sister and I stopped in before a concert, and didn't want leftovers. She didn't want anything with coconut milk, and had never had Thai food before, so I decided to play it safe.  We split the fresh and fried spring roll appetizer and it was delicious. The fresh spring rolls were perfect and the rice paper wrapper was plump and delicious.  I've had a lot of Pad Thai and this was not my favorite, however it was still good. The portion was huge, and we still couldn't finish it between the two of us. I could have used some more fresh veggies in it like green onion and sprouts, but my biggest complaint was it was lacking tartness/acidity and could have used some more tamarind in it to balance out the sweet and salty flavors. I have also never been served Pad Thai without lime wedges to squeeze on top, which would have made a huge difference. Instead it had decorative lemon slices that couldn't be squeezed. Because it was busy and we sat in the bar, our waiter/bartender didn't check on us at all, so I wasn't able to ask for lime. The chicken in it was perfectly cooked and sliced thinly, making it easy to eat.  I definitely would return though, and would probably not order the Pad Thai again. I am interested for sure in their curries as all the photos I've seen look delicious!!! Also, Kudos to this place for being able to seat us when all other restaurants in the area had hour or longer wait times.",

We've been to the downtown location for ValenThai dates (#Valenthai)! The North Side spot is cozy, with the most incredible outdoor seating I've seen!  The decor transports you to a tranquil Thai Oasis in the city; Birds flew around us, scouting the area for stray noodles, and the many fountains and jolly Buddha statues really enhanced the experience! We started our dinner off with Thai Iced Teas and Spring Rolls... My personal appetizer of choice! We proceeded to order curries: He got the Hung Let Curry with tofu Spice Level 3, and I opted for the Duck Curry with a Spice Level 4. Nicky's runs on a 5 level spice system. Everything was so well balanced, although I feel like my Level 4 could have been a touch spicier. It's such a solid good experience over all; I'm absolutely certain we'll be back again soon!",

    "text": "This is my go to Thai place downtown. It's always consistent and delicious. Make sure to make reservations especially on weekends as the place gets very crowded. Every time I've had a reservation I've been seated on time which is nice. They also have a nice lunch special to take advantage of.   The past couple of times I've been here I've gotten the Pad Thai. They allow you to choose your desired spice level from 1-5 (mild, mild-medium, medium, hot, Thai hot). I get the 2 and that's the perfect spice level for me but it's nice they let you choose how spicy you would like your dish. I've also had their Massaman curry which was flavorful although I didn't love the peanut butter taste as much as I would have thought so next time I will try a different curry.   They also have happy hour from 5-7 with good drink deals. I had the $5 sangria which is just what you'd except for a happy hour special.   The reason I'm docking a star is because their service is hit or miss. Sometimes they don't come back at all to check on you and refill your water and you have to hunt down a server for your bill. Regardless, that won't stop me from coming back next time I'm craving Thai.",

Everything was 50% overpriced (pad thai $14.50) compared to cities that actually sell thai food at competitive prices. I was hoping the steep prices would mean quality but I was mistaken.  1) pad thai - pretty sure it was made with ketchup for coloring. Big glob of oversweetened noodles, no authentic tamarind flavor, no coloring from a hot wok and overall bland pad thai. Didnt include lime which always grinds my gears.  2) khao soi - both noodlehead and this place sell the northern dish at their restaurant, best dish by a mile here but that is not saying much.   3) jungle curry, red shit curry, some horrible curry - see picture,  I had three bites and tossed it. Nothing close to resembling a curry that had a paste started in a food processor and certainly not a pestle and mortar. Nothing authentic or tasty in this dish. HORRIBLE.",

    "text": "I was here in town for work and staying at one of the hotels in the strip district.  One afternoon, while the person I was traveling with slept the afternoon away, I had to get out of the hotel and explore, and of course with me that includes food.  A thorough search on yelp and the option for order ahead and take out through yelp was a bonus.  This location was a 10 minute walk from the hotel, and with the sun shining, I took the opportunity to order and make my way over there.  Upon entering, I wish I had gone in for lunch for sit down service.  The ambiance in nice and relaxing.  The decor is really very nice and not at all kitschy. The servers were nice as well, and while I waited another gentleman came in who mentioned that he eats here 2-3 times per week.  My first thought was \"score. I've picked the right place.\"  Food was ready sooner than predicted on yelp, and I was out the door and back at my hotel in no time.   I ordered the spicy noodle lunch with tofu medium.  Let me tell you - that was spicy enough.  Either I've lost my tolerance for spice, or this was generously spiced. I think fellow Roc Yelper, Naz. B, would be happy.  Lunch came with a soup. Not sure the flavor.  It was ok.  Not what I was looking for, but an added bonus so I don't have a bad word for it. I also got a sliced beef salad that is served with mint, tomatoes, red onion, cukes, and carrots.  It was very refreshing and a nice pair with the spicy noodles.  I ended up eating all of this portion and only half of the spicy noodles.  For later, I saved the fresh spring rolls.  I ate these as a \"midnight\" snack, and thoroughly enjoyed them. The egg and noodles in the middle had a really nice flavor that paired well with the veggies.    Overall, I was really please with my experience.  If I was back again in the area, I would probably find an opportunity to eat there again.  I suppose if you're at the convention center and wanted to get out and eat, this would be a good option as it is really not that far.  And it's definitely walkable if you're in the area of 11th and Smallman at the west end of the Strip District.",

I got the duck curry but last time I got the green with chicken that's what I recommend. My boyfriend got the pad Thai at a 3 as well which wasn't as hot because they make it sweet so can always go up if you wish for more spice. Pad Thai was better than the duck curry.  However the tables are extremely close to one another, you can hear everyone around you. The one table bedside us ended up having a bad meal and made a scene so it was a little hard for us to enjoy our meal being that close. The wait time also took a long time, I'm not sure why maybe they were short that day but we got there for a late dinner and it was not crowded and our food took way longer than needed, our waiter knew that too and kept apologizing. It was really just strange because one guy got his food, ate it and left, during our duration and he arrived after us. So maybe it was just our food.   Hopefully our next visit will be better at Nicky's!",

I got a 2/5 spice which was accurate to expectations.  Not very spicy, but that's ok as you never know.  3/5 should be a go to.

I'm a deep lover of Pad Thai, Thai ice tea, curries, and well if it's Thai food I'll eat it. Unfortunately time and again I have had my hopes crushed with subpar wannabe \"Thai\" food. Then a change of pace... I moved to downtown next door to Nicky's and my faith in humanity was restored. Nicky's is more than just thai food it's the real deal it's THAI FOOD!!! The servers are friendly, polite and helpful. The atmosphere is spot on it's like being transported to a shop in Thailand minus the 150 degree temperatures. If you don't sit at the front of the restaurant with it's large windows looking out onto the fun Penn Avenue scene you wouldn't know you were still in the confines of Pittsburgh, PA. Their food is phenomenal, service superb, and ambiance enjoyable. I'll be going back there as much as I can and if you're downtown don't miss out!",

I first discovered this place during my internship last summer and I've been coming ever since. From the atmosphere to the portions do the variety and quality in their menu, there's nothing negative that I can think of when it comes to describing this food joint. I usually am one to order the Gaprow Lad Kao or the Pad Thai but there's an assortment of other items on the menu that are sure to put your taste buds in a euphoric whirl. Their range spice levels (ranging from 1-5) allow for even the most sensitive of pallets to enjoy their food and their lunch and dinner specials are enough to fill up the largest of tummies. The two things I would make sure you make note of though if you plan on dining here is that 1.) They do not do reservations for lunch at this location, only dinner and 2.) This place gets packed relatively quickly, so if you plan on sitting down and enjoying your meal in, definitely try to come in earlier rather than later, especially for their lunch hour.",

Very friendly and helpful, but not somewhere id stop on my lunch break with more than one or two colleagues. Anything larger of a group seem to slow them to a crawl.

We both had the tom kha soup (mine w/ shrimp and #5 on the 1-10 spice level) -- it was AWESOME!  Incredibly flavorful and fresh ingredients.  Just delicious.  One of the best soups I've ever had.  He had the same but w/ no shrimp & no spice - loved it as much as I did.    For entrees, I had the pineapple chicken curry and he had the chicken pad thai.  The servings were generous (enough for leftovers) and we both liked them.  The atmosphere was pleasant (Tuesday night, so not full or obnoxiously loud); the decor was the usual somewhat tacky Asian place.  The server was excellent - he understood what gluten free meant and could quickly point out which dishes were gluten free and which ones could be made that way.  My date was a very sensitive gluten allergy and didn't get ill so that was a win as it's always a big risk to eat in a restaurant.  Definitely recommend this place; it's a gem in the heart of the city and easy walking distance from many hotels, the sports stadiums and everything downtown.  Oh, and the prices were very reasonable for a downtown city restaurant.",

This mushroom broth is divine. It's 5pm on a Sunday night and it's chill and not hectic. What sucks more than being starving and getting crap food? Not much. What's better than being starving and getting great food? Practically nothing. Thai food heroes! And reasonably priced too.",

    "text": "I came here last night with some friends before seeing a show at the Benedum.  Seeing that they accepted reservations, I made one for 6pm, and even though we were slightly late, this gave us plenty of time to enjoy dinner before our show, which started at 8pm.  My friend and I had heard good things about the Pad Thai here, and when another friend said she'd never had Thai food before, that provided us with a perfect opportunity to try it out while expanding her culinary horizons.  We started out with an order of crab rangoon, which had a nice crisp wonton on the outside and filling that was creamy and a bit sweet on the inside.  Three of us ordered the Pad Thai with chicken at varying levels of spiciness--one non-spicy, one a 2 (me), and one a 4 (another friend).  After explaining the typical Thai options to my friend unfamiliar with Thai cuisine, she settled on the Pad See Ew.  While I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur of Pad Thai, I would deem this version excellent, compared to other versions I've had in PGH.  The spice level of 2 was just right for me--at other places, I usually order a 4, but thanks to other reviewers, I knew to tone it down a notch, since this place likes to lay on the heat.  As for the dish itself, the noodle:sprout:meat ratio was perfect.  The sauce was sweet, as it should be for Pad Thai, but not overly so.  The flavors blended together very well--none of them overpowered the others, making for a harmonious combination--as did the combination of textures from the main ingredients.  The noodles were cut up, making them easy to eat with a fork.  I also tried a bit of my friend's Pad See Ew, which was also very tasty, and which she enjoyed as her first introduction to Thai food.  Generally, the service was very good, with one hiccup: my server confused my order of Pad Thai with Pad See Ew.  (I checked with my friends, because I have been known to accidentally order the wrong item, esp. when two items have similar names, but they assured me that I had ordered correctly).  This mistake became apparent when our dishes were served, so everyone except me received their dishes at the same time, making for a bit of awkwardness.  The kitchen did rectify this mistake quickly, however--I didn't have to wait any longer than 5 min. The waitstaff also did a great job of making sure that our water glasses remained full the entire time we were there.  The space itself is beautifully decorated with shiny statues and sparkly wall hangings, and has a very festive feel.  Overall, I'd say this is the best Thai cuisine I've had in PGH, and I'd highly recommend it for lunch or dinner should you happen to be downtown.",

We first ordered the Pork Buns (the full name currently skips my mind) which are a popular Thai item. First impressions: the flavor of the sauces inside the buns were excellent, however, when reaching the pork itself, more than 80% of it was chewy fat; this was consistent with the rest of the buns and I ended up scraping the fat off. Thinking that was just a fluke, We ordered a noodle dish and a curry dish, both with the steamed chicken. First impressions of the curry were all pleasant, until you bit into the chicken, which was like biting into leather. This seemed to be a trend in both dishes. We ended up picking out the pieces of chicken, because they were unworthy of saving. To summarize, this place left me extremely disappointed, especially considering the fantastic reviews. Would not recommend.",

The only reason I didn't give a 5 is because I don't know that the Thai was any better than a place, like Thai Spoon in Dormont (shout-out!), but with much higher prices - hence my 1 star drop.  I had the Pumpkin Curry with Chicken and I would get it again a million times. I've been on a huge pumpkin kick, but the best part is that pumpkin curry is not as \"earthy\" or autumn-tasting as something like a pumpkin pasta. It's a good change. Mild was the perfect amount of kick for me.  I personally loved the environment. It's not quite gaudy, but it's close and I have no complaints. All the shine and large decor on top of purple walls somehow actually makes me feel warm and I thought it was a nice change of pace for a downtown stop.  By all means, this place will be a downtown go-to spot!",

However in my mind, I imagine this has to be pretty darn close to what they offer at Nikki's!  I've ordered take out twice and each time thought it was excellent! I started ordering curry dishes a few years ago when I decided Pad Thai was probably too safe a choice. Since then I've had it all over the city and I can say Nikki's is probably one of my top choices. They also don't hold back when you ask them to spice it up. I'm a fan of extremely hot dishes. On my first order with Nikki's, I went with a medium spice....it was way to mild for me (although it put my wife's mouth in pain for the rest of the day!). Today, I went with the hot and it was definitely kicking. Next time I think I'll try the extra hot and make myself cry home.  While I haven't had a chance to sit down inside, the restaurant looks very cool. Plenty of Thai paraphernalia all over the place and brought back some great memories of being in Asia.....or at least the Asia section of Disney World's Animal Kingdom (although I'd like to do the real thing soon).  Anyway, the moral of my story....go try it and don't play it safe with Pad Thai, they've got a lot on the menu that looks awesome!",

Instead of making a scene, we just paid and left.   My friend said that she orders lunch from here occasionally and she gets the same dish and it comes with a soup or salad and the portion is the same as the dinner portion but it's just in a different container.

It is difficult to hear and be heard. Smell: 8- deliciouness everywhere.  Touch: 5- except for some items you are using your utensils. Although the forks, knives etc. are a cool bamboo inspired shape. Taste: Good range of spices (common of thai places) a 1-10 scale. and the tea was great.  I have been here twice now and have liked it more the second time. I wrote a tip before to make sure you get there early if this is for lunch. The place fills up FAST and they do not take reservations at lunch. The combo of it being crowded and no reservations almost made me go to a 3-star, but the food is just to good. Couple that with fast and polite service I chose to keep the 4th star. If you are in downtown and having lunch with your boss, colleagues or wife, the fast service is nice. Time is of the essense after all in coroprate America. I ordered the beef basil at a 6 level of spicy. I do wish thai places had a standard here in regards to spice because F me I was sweating!!! Yet it was still great. If you like pad thai, you cannot go wrong here. However, there are other great items. Be brave, you will not be disappointed.    Even though the food was great, be midful of the crowd. If you are with a group be sure to leave enough time to wait (unless you get there early).  One thing I have trouble with are the use of tv's. For whatever reason I don't like them in places meant for people to be engaged with one another. Leave that for the bars where no one cares to talk.  Over all, nice people and great food and affordable. Another great part.",

I enjoy spicy food, however I order mine to be a 3 (out of 10) and it was a bit too spicy.  I was able to eat it, but would have preferred a little less heat.    I really wanted to have a good Thai dinner because we don't have a Thai restaurant close to our home and we absolutely love Thai food.  I don't think I will be back to Nicky's if visiting Pittsburgh again.",

The food was decent, but nothing like what I haven't had before.  There were 6 of us and we had ordered 5 dishes, with 2 more servings of rice, everyone was pretty full. I really really liked the duck dish that we got (it was gingery, forget the name though). The mushrooms were really good in both the chicken and the duck dish (couldn't say the same about the chicken). The pad see eww( I never order pad thai, i usually get this instead so I judge places by how they make these), was ok, a little on the saltier side, but still decent (we had got the vegetarian one so dunno how the meat ones would fair).  All in all, a good place, I would like to go again sometime. I was  glad it was open on christmas eve.",

I was getting a little tired of the typical burgers, hoagies, hotdogs, and pizza slices.  Well a coworker suggested Nicky's and indeed a few of my subordinates order from here quite frequently.  Nicky's has some good, reasonably priced lunch specials.  For about 8 bucks or so, you can get a complete lunch with either soup or salad.  I tried the chicken basil with garlic, eggplant, and a whole bunch of Asian veggies too numerous to list.  The chicken was tender, the veggies fresh, and the garlic not overpowering.  I'm normally a soup maven, but I tried the salad with the pineapple dressing and found it very refreshing.  I'm not sure if Thai will become my everyday \"go to\" cuisine, but Nicky's was a nice change of pace and I'll recommend it for our next supervisors luncheon.",

I typically do take-out and get food in the evenings and I have to say the lack of consistency is disappointing. When their food is on, I would say it's some of the best Thai food in the city, but my recent orders have been off more than on.   The appetizers I've tried (e.g., dumplings, spring and egg rolls, chicken satay) are small for the price, so I would skip them entirely. The dinner portions, however, are pretty large and I can usually make two meals out of one entree.",

I find this location appropriate for date night (although it can get loud) or a delicious meal out with friends.   The  service is fantastic. I have visited many times before baseball games or plays and they almost always can get us in. And above all, I love the flavor profiles (especially the spice) here.   Personally, I like to order the shrimp toasts as an app. Then I like to get the basil bok choy tofu. Spicy #7.  Perfect amount of spice. Delicious amounts of flavor bursts.  I will say that I took 1 star off for take out. Spicy #7 is more like NO SPICE when you order take out. I think they forgot to add the spice.... which is my favorite part. I won't order takeout again, but I will definitely return for more in-restaurant meals.",

I guess that has made me a Thai food snob because I got red curry with chicken from Nicky's and it was just very unimpressive and nothing like I'm used to.  It tasted like canned tomatoes with an overwhelming flavor of string beans  (almost as if they used canned string beans and dumped the string bean juice in with everything **yuck**). Also, there was so much red pepper flakes in it that I was actually crunching down on them with every bite! Couldn't taste (or see) any coconut milk in it or any red curry flavor for that matter! It was just a clear liquidity red sauce with red pepper flakes. I like the real deal Thai flavors so this made me sad. I probably won't be back which sucks bc i'm so close by...but  I like authentic Thai food so I'll be driving back out to Glenshaw for the real deal.",

Look like sushi when they bring it out. The crispy egg rolls were amazing as well very skinny and small.  Dinner we all ordered but shared because the portions I think are generous. First yellow curry which is almost like a stew. I was hesitate to try but was delicious tasted like a home cooked meal over rice. Can't go wrong with phad Thai so we got that at a 3 spice level. I would get a little spicer next time. It was really good I love Phad Thai. The server suggested the shittake duck. The mushrooms were awesome first time I had duck it was good. sauce was awesome. Also had spicy green bean with shrimp those are amazing at a spice level 5. Overall good place but pricy.",

When we complained about our portion size and food we had to talk to three different people and eventually the hostess (possible manager) came over and argued with us that it was lunchtime and that's why we had small portions even though our plates were bare in comparison to those around us and even in comparison to past experiences at Nicky's.

I thought I knew what spicy food was until I ordered a 5 at Nicky's- out of 10, but I've heard that they can go up to 20 if you request it. 0-2 is considered mild spice. 3 and up is no longer considered mild. For appetizers, I recommend the Egg Rolls and Samosa, and above all else, I insist upon ordering the Crab Rangoon. I do not enjoy the Spring Rolls. For entrees, the Cashew and Sweet and Sour are staple options. For curry, my favorite above all is the Masamaan Curry, though you can't go wrong with the Pineapple Curry. As for noodles, I prefer sweet noodles, so the Pad Thai is my favorite, but the Phad See Ew is also good, however it's based in a dark sauce, whereas the Pad Thai is much lighter.

    "text": "One of my favorite places downtown.  Great atmosphere.  Great staff.  Very good food.    Living downtown is a treasure for your taste buds.  There are tons of options, and many are excellent.  Nicky's is our go-to place for Thai though!  Food is fresh and well seasoned, and also very reasonably priced.  It's right in the middle of the Cultural District so a great place for people coming in for a show to grab some great food.  Can't recommend this place enough!  A few tips:  Make a reservation if it's a busy night in the theaters and on weekends.  They also tend to go on the spicy side, so a '5' at Nicky's is an '8' at most places.  Consider yourself warned!",

That was really good with lot of different flavors to pack your mouth ( little sweeter for my taste but that's the coconut in it). We also had the rice noodles with sauteed tofu and basil sauce.

I usually don't like to review a restaurant without having eaten multiple dishes, but during my last trip to Nicky's, my friend was just as disappointed as I was, so I figured I might as well. I stopped in again today again. The chicken noodle soup that came with lunch was delicious and the red curry was exactly how I like red curry - creamy and well-seasoned. There was enough rice that I used up all of the remaining curry sauce, and there was a nice variety of vegetables in the curry. There could have been more chicken... I think I found about 5 pieces.   And it's a good deal. I think lunch came out to $9ish plus tip and was a pretty generous portion (except for the chicken). I may come back, but I am seldom downtown.   I'm really on the fence as to whether give Nicky's a 3 or a 4, because Pad See Ew is the food that I would choose to eat if required to pick one food for the rest of my life and Nicky's had really sugary Pad See Ew. I think that the service was good enough to bring it up to a 4. On a busy weekday, it took 20 minutes for them to seat me, take my order, and bring me my food.",

The appetizer sampler, featuring six different appetizers and four sauces both looked and tasted great (and feeds 4 people).  And for dinner, I ordered the Chicken Mango salad.   While I wouldn't normally order a salad as an entree at a Thai restaurant, I'm glad I did as this was probably the best salad I've ever eaten (and a great value too). There were so many things in the salad that I'm hard pressed to describe all of the contents, but rest assured that you'll be satisfied and will likely have enough to take home for a second meal.",

That was a great move on my part because this place is so good. I thought there would be a wait, as I arrived at 7:30pm on a Friday evening, but to my pleasant surprise I was seated right away.  The interior of the restaurant is beautiful. (Part of me thinks the atmosphere inside made the food taste better.) I really felt like I was transported to another world. The restaurant was only about half full (you would think that it would be way more crowded), so there was the perfect amount of chatter around you to make it feel like a restaurant, but not an overwhelming noise that made it hard to talk or hear the person across from you.  I ordered the green Thai iced tea (new to me) and the massaman curry. It took them a while to get me my green Thai iced tea and it seemed like they had forgotten about it, but they were nice and did not charge me for it. The drink was pretty good and its green color made it look pretty cool too. My massaman curry was very, very good. It was so rich in flavor. I thought it wouldn't be enough, but surprisingly I was very full after just finishing half of it. My friend and I also shared the samosas for an appetizer. They were made with sweet potato. I usually don't like sweet potato, but these didn't taste that bad at all. They were light and crisp (but also very hot, so wait a bit before you eat).  Nicky's Thai Kitchen is a great restaurant and probably the best Thai restaurant I've tried in Pittsburgh. Yum! I will most likely be back and bring all my friends who are Thai food fans with me.

The service was super friendly and helpful.   As for food, the spice level ranges from 1 to 20, with 20 being equivalent to fire on a plate. Even the spiciest eater in the group was content with just a 10/20. Instead of settling for the typical pad thai or curry dishes, I attempted to order something unfamiliar. It was a total shot in the dark. I ordered the Lhad Nah, which is a noodle dish in this thick gravy-like brown sauce. The sauce had the consistency of egg drop soup, but without the eggs. It was quite flavorful and surprisingly tasty, despite how thick it looked. The Tom Yum soup was on point as well, with the right ratio of citrus and spices.   Overall my dining experience at Nicky's was really enjoyable. The food was good and the service quick and friendly. Prices weren't too bad either, with entrees ranging from $10-$20.

I ordered tamarind tofu and my husband ordered pad thai with chicken. He said his pad thai was one of the best he's ever had. My tofu, honestly was just OK. I gave it 5 stars nonetheless, because the wait staff was amazing. We had to sit at the bar, and our waitress (along with a few other wait staff at the bar) were always checking in on us, making sure our 4 yr old little guy was having a good time, enjoying his food. Maybe I should have ordered something different, oh well, but their customer service alone deserves a 5 star rating.",

When coming for lunch during the week, get there when they open at 11:30. They fill up very quickly. Food will come fast and there are a ton of staff members but it does get a little chaotic.   They take reservations for dinner but if you go early enough you would be fine without one most days.   This time I came during lunch and it was a group of 4. I had the pineapple curry, one coworker had the panang curry and 2 other had the Phad Phet with shrimp. All recommended!   I wouldn't say best Thai in Pittsburgh but there are a few at the top of the list and this is included!",

When comparing to Dancing Crab's or Noodlehead's better price, taste, and quality, this is what earned Nicky's the lower stars.",

I've tried Nicky's Thai 3 separate times and each time I was never as impressed with Nicky's as I was with Noodlehead. My first visit I got the pad Thai and I wasn't a huge fan. It smells and tastes like it has an overwhelming amount of fish sauce on it. The second time I tried a noodle dish that was supposed to have a sauce on it but my noodles tasted like they had been drying out for an hour on their back counter. I tasted no sauce whatsoever on it. I will say that their side salad that comes with the lunch entree was very good.   As for the decor this restaurant is beautiful. I love looking at all of the decor hanging up around the restaurant. The only complaint about the environment is that they squeezed too many tables into the restaurant. Each time I eat there I struggle to get out from my table without hitting the people at the table next to me. I am not large by any means so this is something they should probably work on.",

I also tried some of their spring rolls, which had a great rice wrap. Their foods are extremely spicy, so just be wary. The portions were huge and prices were reasonable, but not cheap. Service was pretty good, but nothing special. The restaurant is dimly lit and relatively quiet. I'd recommend this place for anyone wanting some Thai food and able to eat spicy. Blessings!",

My waiter was Putu and he seemed unable to handle the crowded restaurant. My friend ordered first for appetizers and he forgot to put hers in as well as give me the chopsticks I asked for. I had to call him over to get them and have him put in her order. The same friend ordered pad Thai and it came after the rest of the table and the egg rolls came after that.   The food it's self was ok. My chicken was over cooked so it was a little dry but the curry was good. There was only one small bowl of rice for two people to share. It was really enough for one person if they wanted to use the curry over rice. To get more you had to pay extra.   When it came time for the bill. Putu only took some of the bills and after waiting for a long time we had to call him back to get the rest. We had a party of 5 and they automatically included gratuity. I'm not usually a fan of that for this very reason. We received very poor service and he received a full tip.   Next time, I would probably order take out or go to the one on the Northside.",

I just went here for the first time a week ago!   1/23/16: We went on a Saturday night and didn't have a reservation but luckily they seated us at the bar, which was very comfortable for the two of us. Their menu is huge! I had such a hard time picking out what to order. For an appetizer I ordered the Chicken Satay and it was delicious! They gave me like 6 pieces of chicken! The sauces that came with it were very good as well. For my dinner I had the Cashew Chicken. It came with white rice in this beautiful golden bowl. The cashew chicken had a great sweet red pepper chili taste!   5/9/16: I took my dad here and he was incredibly impressed. He had never had such authentic Thai food in his life. Of course I had the cashew chicken again but we shared the banana and coconut dessert and it was delicious! This place just can't be beat! The best Thai food in Pittsburgh and probably on the East Coast!  The servers are very helpful but they're a little hard to understand sometimes. Other than that, the food and atmosphere here is great!",

    "text": "This is my favorite place to eat for lunch in the entire city. I go here at least once a week and most recently went here three times in one week. It is located on a non-busy side of town on Penn Avenue right past Pizza Parma. Inside there are gorgeous pictures and a dimmed lights atmosphere perfect for a date or a lunch gathering. I go here with friends and even by myself. Most of the lunch meals are under $9.00 and they include your choice of a house salad that has a unique pineapple flavored dressing or chicken & rice soup which is always extrememly hot and tasty. The server staff is excellent and very quick in bringing out your food. As soon as my order is taken my salad or soup is immediately brought out and once I finish that here comes my entree.   Onto the entree selections. I typically try and get something new here, but my very favorite is the Beef Phad Phet with a 9 spice level. I typically get between a 7 and a 9 depending on the day, but the spice levels go up to a 20 so if you like spicy flavors this place is for you. This dish includes beef, garlic, bell peppers, green beans, carrots, onions, thai basil and an incredible spicy chili sauce with rice on the side. i have also gotten the Spicy green beans, Spicy peanut, Jalepeno, and the Red Curry which are all amazing. My friend really likes the Green curry. I might try that once next time. You have the option of choosing chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, vegetable, duck or tofu. I like the beef the best and like the chicken with my curry.  I am always full when I leave this place and you cannot beat the prices or the quality of the food anywhere. I would recommend to make dinner reservations or if you go for lunch to go either at 11:00 or 1:30. I like to go at 1:30 because it is not crowded when I arrive and even less crowded by the time I finish up and leave the restaurant.   Bottom Line: Seriously give this place a try. Even if you don't like spicy food it is all excellent.",

    "text": "Once again, I move from Pittsburgh only to make a weekend trip back for a Breast Cancer Volleyball Game to find another great gluten free Thai place.   Its downtowns so be ready for traffic and crappy parking-if you are from Pittsburgh know already know this-if you are not-be patient!  It was a saturday night and we did not make reservations-we actually were planning on going somewhere else that had a long wait so I hopped on this wonderful world of YELP! And found Nicky's.   They sat us right away, the space is VERY small and cramped, you will be getting to know your neighbor very well.   The menu is extensive, I was overwhelmed and stuck with the same thing I always get, as did Jason. All my sensories were overwhelmed by the menu, the hustle and bustle and the amount of people in this tiny place!  Jason got sake and I got the jasmine hot green tea. Both came out quickly. The waiter was not 100% certain of the gluten items they had so he waved another waiter over to help. She knew the menu well and informed me of some things I could and could not have.   We started with the crispy peanut tofu-I loved it, Jason was not sold. He is not used to tofu though (the texture canm be different for some people). It was a large portion, I probably would have been full and content with just that.   But of course I had to order my ever trusty red curry! Its probably the best curry I have ever had. I loved the presentation of the food (gold bowls and plates). The portions were very large, I took home enough for two more meals. I did have to ask for extra rice, they skimped on that. There was an extra charge for more rice.  I ordered mine hot (6), and it was perfect! Many places do not get their levels right, this place has no issue. It came with peppers, eggplant, peas and chicken in it. They have other protein for it if you wanted something different. My curry was loaded with ingredients, again you don't see that often.   Jason ordered the pad thai (this is his go to as well). He doesnt do well with spicy so he got mild. It was perfect temperature for his NY/Canadian sensitive mouth. (they don't know what spicy is). (level 3) His had great flavor, sometimes thai can be very bland-this was not even close. It has an authentic flavor-he ordered shrimp with his. They were larger shrimp, not the little baby shrimp you see most places.   The price was somehwat up there, I think our meal came to about $50.00 for both of us.  I didn't have to ask for a refill once on my drinks-the service was that good. I could not believe the amount of people who were working such a small place, but they really are on top of things. If you read my reviews you know I am HUGE on customer service. This place does not disappoint on any level. I can't wait to go back to the  Burg' and eat here in April.",

I would recommend getting takeout however if possible because the restaurant is pretty crowded on the inside due to a lot of close packed tables and the crowd of people that always seems to be standing at the front of the restaurant which spills over into the seating area.  This might also be a winter only problem, but when I was eating here recently with a few other people, every time someone opened the door a huge blast of cold air rushed into the restaurant which made it pretty uncomfortable to eat.  All the food that I've had from here though has been great and pretty fairly priced especially considering the huge portion sizes you get.  When we ate in we got the fried egg rolls, which were deliciously flaky and perfectly cooked.  I like spicy food, but Thai places don't mess around with their heat so you should definitely pick a milder spice level if you don't want to scorch your taste buds.",

It's decorated with so many flowers and statues, and is a beautiful ambiance for such a great meal. I enjoyed their paid Thai with shrimp, which was slightly spicy and delicious. We also split a few appetizers, the pork dumplings and the egg rolls. Both were very good, and the dipping sauce with the dumplings was very savory and delicious. Definitely a spot I would want to visit again! Can't wait to go back!",

Just the right amount of spice to wake me up, but not so firey that I didn't enjoy it.  My companion ordered some sort of curry with fried fish and pineapple.  He, of course, ordered it Thai spicy (level 10) and enjoyed sweating through the entire dish.  Service was excellent - they kept on top of the water glasses and the food took no time at all.  A winner.",

The vibe is definitely more \"downtown\" and upscale, but the service and food are equally excellent. This location has a liquor license, and we were surprised at their reasonable prices on many of the alcoholic beverages. The menu looks a bit different, but is nearly identical to the North Side location.  Similar to the Western Ave. Nicky's, this location gets crazy busy, and the layout has even more tables crammed into a fairly small space. Be prepared to get a little cozy with your neighbors.  Overall, we were really pleased with every aspect of our experience, and will likely be back soon. The food standards were on par with their other location, and it was nice to see some of their top waitstaff from the North Side working downtown!",

It was a dish served on a bed of rice with ground chicken, basil, spices, red pepper, and an over easy egg on top with a yolk so tender that as soon as you touched it, the ooze would coat the dish giving the rice and the chicken some moisture and richness. I loved it. I also got a Thai Iced tea on the side.   I ordered spicy level 10 and I feel that the kitchen went a little easy on me, but it was still delicious and I felt that beautiful kick.",

I got there at about 11:45 on a Friday morning and I'm glad that I did.  The place started to fill quickly.   I was seated promptly and given a minute to look over the menu. Decisions, decisions... there were so many items that I wanted to try but settled on the spicy green beans with chicken. The waiter took my order and ask me, on a scale of 1 to 10, how spicy I would like it. I do like spicy foods so I went with an 8.   My house salad came quickly: lettuce, tomato, carrots, a slice of mango, a cube of pineapple, sprinkled with crumbled peanuts and lightly coated in a sweet dressing. Delicious!  I thought it took a little longer than it should for my entree to come and used the time to take in the decor. Lots going on here with all of the art. It was almost museum like.  When my dish finally did arrive, I just sat there and admired it for a few moments. Visually it was a work of art. The greens of green beans against the reds of the pepper with the sprinkle of red flakes on the chicken all on top of the red sauce was simply a thing of beauty. Then on the other side of the plate laid a perfectly shaped round mound of rice with a single ragoon elegantly placed on top. In front of the rice was a swirl of carrot strips and a green leafy garnish just for appearance. The chef gets an A++ for presentation!  When I finally did dive into the meal it was simply delightful. I never had green beans taste this good! The amount of spiciness was perfect. The texture of the beans and peppers was crisp and the chicken was cooked to perfection. I now know what all the hoopla surrounding Nicky's Thai is all about. I will definitely come back again and again.",

This downtown location was BUSTLING, completely packed inside with customers squeezed in the narrow and small entrance. I didn't have a reservation which I wasn't aware they accepted so my girlfriend and I had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Wasn't ideal as people were coming and going, some to pick up orders, others to fill their reservations. Point being it was hectic but this doesn't merit a 4-star rating because...  The food was AMAZING just like I remembered. I ordered the chicken Lhad Nah which is a garlic soup-like broth with veggies and flat noodles. Now call me a wimp because I only got a 3 spice level but the flavors were out of this world. Having cravings for it as we speak. Paired that with a Coconut Mojito which was very refreshing!   Definitely stop in here or to the North Shore location. Awesome food. We'll definitely be back soon.",

Nicky's \"Vegan Duck Curry,\" which they named \"VEGAN\" is not vegan at all. In fact, it's not even vegetarian - they use fish oil in the sauce. I ate this dish numerous time until I found out that the curry is not vegan. Further, even when I asked them to remove the fish oil, they wouldn't do it. Even worse, when I told them that it was really misleading to name a curry \"VEGAN Duck Curry\" and that they should probably not do this for liability issues (False advertising, reckless endangerment when it comes to people with allergies), they told me \"oh yeah, we have been told by a lot of people that this is misleading.\" They also told me that they weren't going to change the practice. I am very disappointed with how rude they were and that they refused to stop their practice of False advertising. I went from being a regular customer to never returning. Vegans and vegetarians beware! (Go to Siam's instead. It is around the corner and it has even better Thai food than Nicky's with no fish oil).",

    "text": "Pretty much your typical Americanized Thai restaurant with a fairly lengthy menu and the typical fare of popular curries, stir fries, soups, and salads.  While nothing I tried here was mindblowing or very original, it would be unfair to say it didn't hit the spot for my (perpetual) Thai craving.  Nicky's was packed both with clientele and narrow-aisled rows of tables on a Saturday night.  Despite how busy it was, service was quick and attentive for our party of 5.  Our server spent quite a bit of time answering our questions about spiciness levels and whatnot and was super patient with us, despite probably having heard our same requests thousands of times.  My jasmine tea was lovely.  Our food came out surprisingly quickly at all, first my VEGETABLE TOM YUM SOUP, and then my BROCCOLI entree and my fiance's BEEF PAD PHET entree.  My soup was packed with veggies, which was great, but lacked a depth of flavor that I usually take for granted in typically in this pleasantly super sour and umami dish.  My broccoli stir fry, however, was wonderfully seasoned and slightly sweet, and I regret absolutely nothing about it.  My fiance's stir fry was much more one-noted as mine.  Not untasty, but just not that exciting either.  I also tried a bite of my friend's GREEN CURRY, which was coconutty and sweet but fell a bit flat otherwise as well.  Having spent a year living in Thailand and as a lover of the cuisine, she was not impressed.  The biggest disappointment, however, was that nothing was as spicy as we wanted it to be.  Our server had tried to talk our table of chili heads out of ordering anything higher than a 7, but my soup at an 8 had nothing spicy going for it besides a few chili flakes on top, and my entree was more sweet than anything else.  The pad phet was the only dish that turned out slightly spicy, but we considered it much more of a 6 or 7 than the 10 we had ordered.  We ended up asking for the condiment caddy to take matters into our own hands, which vastly improved the matter.  I feel like the condiments would find a welcome home on every table to begin with.  When she gave us the check, our server told us they have a spice level 20...would have been good to know.  It's totes understandable that spiciness levels are completely subjective and hard to gauge or recommend, but if you get customers asking for fire, don't hold back.  So long story short, Nicky's suffers from the typical popular Americanized Thai restaurant ailment--lots of potential, but it doesn't dare to be Thai enough.  Please, bring on the heat and the fish sauce.  Some, if maybe not all, customers are ready and willing.  Besides that, everything I ate was totally satisfactory and I would order it again--if I came back, that is.  But with Smiling Banana Leaf being much less afraid to drop umami bombs, I'm not sure if that will happen anytime soon.  And a tip for the proprietors: update your online menu!  It's missing an entire vegetarian section and a bunch of awesome sounding dishes.  Please and thanks.",

Mixed seafood was not overcooked and not overpowering.  Highly recommend this place for the reasonable price, more than adequate amount of food, helpful wait staff, and comfortable environment.  Oh, and the sweet salad was unexpectedly refreshing, and I would almost only want that if I didn't want the spicy noodles so much!",

I called ahead to make reservations, which a lot of people recommended on here, and it turned out to be a good choice because the place is on the smaller side, although they do manage to cram a lot of tables in the small space. There were several parking garages in the area which was convenient for us as we drove into the city. The food, though, was obviously the best part of our visit.  It was totally out of this world. I got Pad See Eau, a friend got Pad Thai, and two in our group got the curry, and everyone finished their food despite the portion sizes being pretty big. It was phenomenal. I can't wait to go back.",

It was great then, but im glad that I finally dined in.  Service was great. We had one main server, but others were also on top of checking up on us. I'm pretty sure a person had a job of constantly refilling water. It was appreciated lol  I ordered pineapple curry with chicken. It was not my first time trying this dish at Nickys, however, the gold dish it served in is much better than a take out dish.  My boyfriend ordered duck curry. He loved it.  Spice level is 1-10 which could either make it easier or more difficult to determine your spice level.  Great meal here as always. Dining room has my h more space than the north side location. The decor inside was nice also.  Nickys is the best and I've tried many nice Thai places in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "It's a shame I had to give this place a three because the food is good. It taste like what you expect Thai to be and fresh. But the service was not great.  We came here on a Saturday night busy at 7pm. We made reservations and that is suggested because of the size of the restaurant.  The website offers BYOB. It says there is a $5 cork fee for the north side location and $10 for downtown. The waiter said that there isn't BYOB downtown so this was misleading.   Our waiter was not attentive or friendly. I asked him what the best curry was and he just goes \"I don't know whatever you like\" ummm ok. No. He also messed up my friends meal and didn't put in her appetizer at all and she got her food last. He never came by to check on us and the food runner was more attentive then our waiter. O and he also messed up the check. It took super long to get it corrected.   As far as the food, the fresh spring rolls were good. Filling as well. They could easily be a meal for someone who doesn't have a robust appetite like I do. The presentation was great too. Very nice decor in the restaurant but it's pretty loud. Might be good for a first date, because there won't be any awkward silence since you can't hear each other anyway.   I also ordered the panang curry medium. The sauce was great but it wasn't too spicy. I would have gotten it stronger by personal preference. It's too bad the service wasn't great because I would eat here again based on the food. Maybe I will try the other location.",

    "text": "Haven't even received the food and I'm already upset with this place. First of all, a donation was automatically added to my order. I was not asked to donate. When I tapped the button on Grubhub to order, I was immediately presented with a notice that I had donated to some group. Really? You didn't even ask me? I have no idea who my money was donated to and the information is nowhere to be found - not on the order details, receipt or in the order confirmation email. Next thing that happened was I received an email notice from Grubhub that an update had been made to my order. The restaurant, without my approval, added an additional charge of $5.90 because I requested brown rice. Nowhere did it say there was an up-charge for brown rice while ordering, I just asked for it if possible. Still, I need to approve additional charges. So, it appears I have almost $7 in additional charges which I did not approve. I'm wondering if they're going to automatically 'adjust' the tip now that the price of the order has increased. Stay tuned for updates.   I waited to post this review until after the food was delivered. Didn't want to risk the order by complaining before I received it. Overall, the food was pretty good. The brown rice that I was charged extra for was more like rice pilaf than rice you'd expect. When I opened the small containers it looked like Rice-a-Roni. It was a bit mushy too. Also, the Crab Rangoon, were pretty good, but they put them on a bed sliced (think coleslaw sliced) red cabbage. I'm assuming they did this because they were right out of the fryer and would melt the styrofoam container. The problem is, the Rangoon soaked up the moisture and were wet and mushy. What a shame.   Curry was pretty good - for Pittsburgh - but just average in a better city like Chicago, NYC, etc. Fresh spring rolls were good, but don't compare to the spring rolls from Cambod-Ican Kitchen.   Overall the food was average or a little above average. I won't be ordering again because of the problems with the unapproved additional charges for the automatic donation and the Rice-a-Roni.   Next call is to Grubhub to figure out why they allowed unapproved charges.  Final note - STOP USING STYROFOAM!!!",

They have small utensils but I loved the atmosphere as well as the service. If you order a luncheon entree you get a choice of their soup of the day or salad with a pineapple dressing.  I opted for the chicken teriyaki with mixed vegetables. It comes with white rice and took the salad. The salad was your traditional tossed salad but the pineapple dressing was out of this world good! My entree was generous and I knew I couldn't finish all that rice but I loved every bite of it.   They do have dessert menu but I figured I'd save that till next time. Reservations are accepted but you probably don't need them for a Sat lunch. I would advise it more so for dinner since the place is small. The staff was very attentive to my needs.  What I also like is the fact that they ask you how spicy you want your food. I can't handle hot spicy food so I'm glad I can have it mild and enjoy it as well. Nicky's Thai kitchen has a second location over on the Northside which I will assume is just as good.  They do have a full bar area in the back if you are interested with TV sets.  Good food, great service, A definite must return!",

I was really looking forward to some Vietnamese food, but everyone else was in the mood for Thai. I ordered the noodle soup with beef, and it was pretty close to the Vietnamese Pho I love at Pho Lang Tang in Findlay Market in Cincinnati. The broth in my soup was incredibly flavorful. I have a pretty high tolerance for \"heat\" in my foods. The waiter asked me how spicy would I like to go, on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being the hottest. I asked him how spicy be thought 5 was, he said pretty spicy. . . so I went with 4. I don't like my food so spicy that you can't taste what you are eating, that being said. . . I could have easily gone for the 5. . . everyone had different pallets for heat I suppose. The soup was really good. Some of the other things ordered at our table was crab rangoon, a mango scallop something or other, and crab fried rice, which my wife said was the best fried rice she has ever had. Overall, we had a very good meal and it was reasonably priced. 3 adults and 3 kids, one being 2, and the bill was less that 50 dollars. We chose to drink water, and we are aware of what our children eat, we do our best to never over indulge. Still walked out with leftovers.",

He said he wants to go back once a week.  :)   We had an appetizer sampler platter and crab rangoons to start.  Both were amazingly delicious.  We got a few main dishes and shared around the table.   The pad thai and the crab fried rice were out of this world.  We were celebrating, so we had some desserts as well.   The Sticky Mango rice was absolutely incredible.     Would HIGHLY recommend.   Great restaurant, great staff!!!",

Ordered takeout for pickup and when my order was read back to me over the phone the lady simply stated \"pineapple curry\" not specifying that I had ordered shrimp. She had me repeat my order multiple times, I clearly said shrimp each time. IT IS GOOD FRIDAY, one of the meals we ordered was SHRIMP because that person does not want to eat meat for religious reasons. When we arrived home the curry was chicken and had no rice. The restaurants response when I called back to tell them of the issue...\"I read your order back to you\" -- clearly not entirely or I would have corrected it. They offered no solution, were dismissive and rude when I brought up the issue, then they didn't even offer to replace the missing rice. FIRST, ONLY AND LAST TIME I EVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT, they clearly don't understand that the hospitality industry relies on customer satisfaction.",

The food is delicious and I love to order a variety of dishes and share with the table so that I can get a little taste of everything.  The Pad Thai is one of my favorites, but I don't really think you can go wrong.  This location is not very big and gets pretty crowded, so making a reservation is definitely the way to go!  Also we had a member of our party that is allergic to shellfish, the waitress was very accommodating and made sure that she didn't bring anything with shellfish, however this really cut down on the options for this person.  Just something to be aware of if you have a shellfish allergy.  Even though there were less options, the dishes that she could have were just as delicious.  I love this place for a date night or a night out with friends.  Fun setting and great food, you can't beat it!",

We were tired and not in much of a mood to explore, The bell hop in our hotel suggested the restaurant, and as it was close we went. The place was packed on a Saturday night and we had to wait a few minutes for a table. Once seated it took a while for our server to come round, but when he did he apologized for the wait, After that the service was very good. The food was even better. Spicy, flavorful, hot and fresh. I recommend the Honey Bee cocktail, a specialty of the house. Sweet, sour and with just a hint of cayenne. We have the Vegetables 4 U platter and they were all great. The crispy duck was also terrific.",

I got a 3 out of 5 spiciness level and that was perfect for my taste buds.  My only minor complaint would be is that the chicken could be softer. It was a little bit hard but nonetheless still very good. I would recommend calling ahead for a reservation as it can be packed especially on a weekend. Service is mediocre, I have had experience where it was very good and experience where it wasn't that great but it really depends on how packed the restaurant goes. I would highly recommend Nicky's for Thai out of all Thai restaurants.",

Upon entering, you're transported to another world - the interior is lavishly decorated with golden statues and other cultural decorations.

Some notable dishes that I've had are the Sen Mee Pad See Ew, Thai Basil Chicken (note that the entrees don't come with a side order of rice), Drunken Noodles, and the Crab Fried Rice. Their appetizers are exceptional as well. This one time they had Thai style chicken wings that I still dream about to this very day.

It took us much longer than expected to find parking, so we ended up reaching at 8.16pm. By then, our table was given to someone else. So, we had to wait for an additional 20 minutes before we were seated. The ambience is really nice, with Thai artwork decorating the floor and the walls.   For the appetizer, we shared a Mango salad (spice level 7). The sweet mangoes complimented the spicy sauce very well. However, the sauce had a fishy aroma to it, which I did not appreciate too much. I was expecting the salad to leave a fresh feeling, but instead was left with a fishy feeling.   I got a pad see ew, which is my favorite Thai item. Really liked it. The flat noodles were really soft and juicy. My wife had gotten the tofu Llad Nah, which she found too watery.",

    "text": "I've eaten a lot of Thai food and Nikky's did not disappoint! From the elegant decor and atmosphere to the cocktails and absolutely delicious food, Nikky's delivered and I can't wait to eat here again.   We started with the Crab Rangoon which was delicious as long as you like cream cheese which I do. Also, the coconut Mojito was delightful! A little pricey at $10 but definitely a good Mojito and I really wanted two! My favorite Thai entree is always red curry with tofu and extra vegetables. My request was accommodated with a few extra dollars for the extra veggies. Spice level is 3-10. Three here is basically not spicy at all. I've had up to 7 which was spicy but not too spicy for me (I like medium spice level usually). Food is served in fun \"gold\" dishes and flatware. I LOVE coconut rice. It might sound weird to those who haven't had it but you must try it once! I haven't had it with the mango here, only the ice cream which is amazing!   Staff had always been polite and service quick even when they are busy. Prices about $10-15 per entree. Parking is on the street or nearby lots.   Can't want to eat here again!",

I even gave a tip out of habit... wtf?  She was pushy throughout my time there and tried to force me to order an appetizer, even though I was not interested due to allergies. When I asked about possibly removing some ingredients due to an allergy, she gave me an attitude and said that it was part of the dish and not be removed.  Well, excuse me for asking and, god forbid, risk making her job harder. I cannot believe how rude people are these days: it's obvious that she would rather have a customer order more and get sick.",

The dish came with enough veggies, Basil, and the presentation is very good. Flavor was good but not too heavy.  Service was attentive and good as well. I asked for water with no ice and the whole time they remembered. The ambiance is very classy. Good for dates or just coming for food.  Wish I could eat more. Will certainly return!",

The 5 mini egg rolls with sweet dipping sauce were hot & crispy. The Tom Kha coconut soup is fantastic & was full of fresh veggies & tofu (choice to add chicken, shrimp, etc). My husband had the whole crispy sea bass and I had green curry with chicken. Both entrees were very good & served with white rice to share. Even though they have a bar, you can still BYOB with a corkage fee. Service was quick & friendly. It's a small place, so when it's crowded, which is all the time during prime dining hours, be prepared to have other guests seated very close to you. You can choose 1-10 spice level. I like some spice, but even a 4 could be too spicy for some. We will definitely return & hope to try the North Hills location soon.",

Chicken teriyaki was tough and pieces was too large. Our not-vegitatian friend who have been to Thailand and knows Thai  coisine didn't like this meal at all. But the worst for us was that our vegitatian Pad See Ews: they were with small pieces of meat!! We asked a manager to change both Pad See Ews, we explained that on our opinion kitchen staff either use meat in the recipe or don't clean pans. The guy answered that the meal is vegitarian and asked us whether we want same meal if it's gonna be maid on the same pan (!!!!). And he asked us that what he will suppose to do if we don't like new meals again. What??? So we sad that we want fried rice instead because it wasn't bad at all. But later we cancelled this order at all because we were afraid that with this kind of service and manager they can even spit into our food. Manager agreed to cancel our order but asked us in a sarcastic way why we eat eggs if we are vegitatians. So, dear manager, you shouldn't talk like that with costumers. And people who don't eat eggs they are vegans , not vegetarians. Read about different types of nutrition and know that for most vegetarians cross-contamination with meat is not acceptable.",

The spring rolls had too much rice paper used as the wrapping, and the sauce tasted just like hoisin with chopped peanuts on top. The pad Thai was dry and inedible, and unbelievably bland. I ordered it with a spice level of 4/5, and it had no flavor at all. I have no idea why this restaurant has such high ratings and I'm hoping my meal was just a fluke.",

In order to be seated, you had to run your ass on people's shoulders as you scooch by. In turn, asses are rubbed on your shoulders too... just expect it. The owners simply try to fit too many people in. So, you're crammed and yelling the whole time because SO IS EVERYONE ELSE.   Anyway, the food: I got pork Thai fried rice,- good Thai barometer. The server didn't give a shit about being nice because he's obviously playing a volume game and figures he can make more money by serving more customers poorly that fewer customers excellently. The rice came out too spicy to really enjoy which I hate; and this is not surprising given the choices I was given up front about spice: \"Do you want no spice, sweat a little, or sweat a lot?\" I said \"I want a little spice, but I don't want to sweat.\" Either he didn't understand what that meant or more likely didn't give a shit.",

Thus location can get very busy, so of its a Wednesday -Saturday evening, call ahead for rsvp.   Food quality is on par. Best ingredients for Thai recipes from Curry to Hot Pepper Flakes to coconut. Sometimes the specials are out of this world. Def try the Pumpkin Curry dishes. Seafood is always fresh tasting.   Great for groups, date night, sitting solo at the back bar...Restaurant can get loud so acoustics are a bit annoying on very busy evenings.   Good comes out quickly so order in a timely manner to get to enjoy everything.  Also, there is a lot of food in a plating so sometimes splitting a meal is a good option if you are not too hungry or have a smaller appetite.    Pad Thai and Fresh Spring Rolls are quite popular. Tom Ka Soup is excellent. Get it as a hot pot!  Fun dining and great food, can't go wrong if your a Thai connoisseur or a novice. Encourage friends to try if they haven't been.",

    "text": "OH MY GOD!  Visited the Burg over the weekend and my obvious choice was Thai food. We were in town for the light up event so decided to drop into Nicky's for dinner. It was super crowded and there was a half hour wait, but believe it or not, every single person who was leaving said the wait was so worth it.  We had two vegan friends with us. The Server was kind enough to let us know of any fish /oyster sauce in the food and made sure we ordered right.  Appetiser:  Veggie spring rolls: Light and fresh and the peanut sauce was just magic!  Entree:   Vegetable fried rice: This was hands down the best fried rice I've eaten in my life! It was just so good that despite being full to brim I couldn't stop eating it. I can still feel the burst of flavours in my mouth!  Tofu and eggplant entre: Sooo good. Deliciously spicy and such a perfect balance of flavours.  Vegetable Red curry: Again such great flavours. The coconut milk was light and perfect and the veggies were so fresh!  Let me remind you that all the above mentioned dishes are completely vegan. Loved this place! Totally made my night!  Also, did I mention, its SO reasonably priced! Bang in the middle of downtown Pittsburg with such great food and such competitive prices. This place is just the best!",

So after some bumps along the way, I think this downtown location has smoothed things out to run the great business they are! Service this time around was stellar with no complaints!  I just can't stop saying how much I love the space in general. It's gorgeous! Great for a date night or just catching up with your lady friends. Funny enough, it's so dimly lit that the servers will give you a flashlight to read your menu! Hysterical and thoughtful.  I'm really coming into my own with Thai food and was excited to order the Green Curry, as it's my latest obsession (I know, Thai food two days in a row here!). It was fabulous. The spice level is always a little iffy, meaning you never really know what you'll get even when you order the same level every time you come in. I ordered a 5 on the spice scale and got maybe a 6. I know, not that big a deal, but I was definitely reaching for my water glass!  It had loads of veggies mixed with a creamy coconut sauce. I also like that you can order brown rice. This certain brown rice I've never seen before. It's very dark and is actually cooked so that it pretty much has the same texture of white rice. You can still taste the brown rice flavor, but I've never had such fluffy brown rice before.   I have a feeling this place is going to fast become my new downtown go to spot. Add that pending liquor license and you'll compete for my dollars with Meat and Potatoes!",

    "text": "We were extremely disappointed with the service at this establishment. This place was unacceptable.  Let's see, examples:  One waiter had overfilled a glass of water that had already been drunk out of, so he POURED THE GLASS BACK INTO THE PITCHER AND CONTINUED POURING INTO OTHER GLASSES. Imagine if that person had mono or was sick! The whole restaurant would get sick!  The waiters forgot our appetizer.  One waiter spilled curry on my friend's shirt and proceeded to ignore that it happened.  One waiter was pouring a glass of water and almost spilled it on my friends; she ducked to avoid it.  For both of our entrees, we asked for 4 and 6 spice level out of 10. Both had ZERO spices.  They first sat us down at a nice window table, but the hostess said that she set us down at a table that had been reserved. So she made us move one table over. Then one chair was too close to one of our chairs, so she made us move one chair over, but it made no sense because she could still sit there and have the chair moving. The reserved group came, drank a drink and proceeded to leave.  In conclusion, do not go to this restaurant if you want to live.",

    "text": "This is one my favorite restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh.  I usually go about once every two weeks during lunch. You MUST go early in order to get a table.  Pros: the food is reasonable priced which is about $8 for chicken/pork/tofu. There are many dishes that I've tried and really liked. One of them is the sweet and sour dish. I was never a big fan of curry but I enjoy their curry selection. I would recommend the Massaman curry. It's a peanut and coconut base. Most of the meals come with soup or salad. I usually get the soup which is a ginger base with rice and veggies. There is some meat, I think it's pork. The salad is like a summer and light dressing which consists of mango and peanuts.  Cons: the waiting time takes forever during lunch. I dislike the seating arrangements since each table is right next to each other which makes you feel as you are sitting right next to the people on your left and right. I also do not like how loud that place is. If you are meeting friends to catch up, do not go there during lunch. It's hard to hold a conversation when the noise drowns everything out.",

I tried any way because there was a martini featured on the drink menu and it included olives. Considering the anticipated and welcomed language barrier from a terrific Thai restaurant, my dirty martini came to the table as the feature martini from the menu which included a lot of basil and olives-not a good mix. That being said the place is small but wasn't too packed for a 9pm dinner on a Saturday night. The service was fast, and the food was absolutely delicious. The beef mint salad is one of my go to Thai menu items and I must say it was by far the best mint beef Thai salad I have ever had. I cannot wait to go back, but definitely not for the martini feature.",

If it were just that, I'd give this place two stars, but the water glasses are tiny (narrow cylinders with a thick base) , and the indoor dining area has no vents and is very echoey, so with even a small amount of people, it was really hot and noisy.  My husband and I ordered the Pad Thai and Hung Ley Curry. The curry we hadn't tried before. Our waiter told us it was similar to Panang, but creamier. I had told him we like red curries, so I was hoping it was red, but apparently it's yellow (which we don't like much), and the similarity to Panang was the addition of peanuts. We ordered both dishes at their hottest (we've had plenty of beautifully hot Thai food). The food came out really quickly, which seems odd for Thai food. The Pad Thai was super sweet, and therefore not very hot (which our waiter did mention when he brought the food). The tamarind flavor was present, but the dish was still bland and lacked any savory balance. The Hung Ley Curry was even more bland, and the heat didn't really meld with the other flavors (what little there were). It was hot, although I was expecting more based on the waiter's description.  We won't be back. I was hoping Pittsburgh had good Thai food since we can't get any in our area, but the positive reviews for this place make that seem unlikely.",

    "text": "Met up with a friend here on a busy Saturday afternoon for lunch. Swan Lake was playing and the place was buzzing, but I was able to snag a table pretty quickly. Needing to be warmed up I ordered a flower tea and a bowl of Tom Kha soup with chicken while I waited for my friend to arrive. The tea seemed already sweetened, which was fine with me, and the soup was in a way bigger bowl than I expected and was absolute coconut creamy goodness.   My main entree was the Thai fried rice with crab. I sampled this dish a few years ago at the Northside location and loved it. What I had today wasn't bad, just not nearly as good as I remembered it. I would get it as a side dish, but not my main dish. Don't get me wrong, it was good! Just not out of thing world and not something I'd want a whole plate of again.   The place was beautifully decorated, and the service seemed a bit scattered, but food was pumping out of that kitchen quickly even with a full restaurant. The lunch portions were extremely reasonable for the price ($9-$12 per entree at a fancy downtown spot) and tasty. My friend liked her sliced beef salad but said it wasn't filling. Docking one star for scattered and unorganized service. Though very friendly, our waitress didn't seem to be very experienced or quick, and split our checks wrong.   Oh! Even though this place is prob twice the size of the Northside location, they still crammed in about three tables too many. When you factor in the chairs because they use no booths, things get can get cozy REAL quick!!",

It's a great Thai experience for someone who has never had it before or for someone with limited knowledge. Idk my servers name but my husband and I were there on Super Bowl Sunday on north shore and she was very friendly!",

The pad see ew had plenty of broccoli and tofu and could probably have been enough for 2 for dinner. Vegetable Red curry was flavorful and I love that all the vegetables tasted fresh. I wasn't the biggest fan of the pumpkin custard, but it's probably because it tasted more like a sweet bread than a custard to me. I wouldn't call this the best thai food I've ever had, but, the food is good and will satisfy your craving for thai.",

Probably the best in the city albeit I've only gone to 2 others.   The ambiance is nice and the decorations are pretty cool too. You'll notice that if you don't get there at 11:30 you will have a tough time waiting for a seat. This place gets packed every day so either arrive early or expect to eat a late lunch. The prices are fair although a little expensive. They have a lunch menu too.   This is definitely a once a week kinda place and if your in the mood for thai food definitely check this place out first.",

Vegetables in the dishes were cooked perfectly as in they were still crispy and bursting with flavor.  I had the Spicy Basil Fish and the sauce was delicious.  Portions are also pretty large and quality of ingredients used is high.   I was furthermore impressed with the excellent service and nice ambiance.  My water glass was almost always full.  I have had a lot of Thai in Pittsburgh that is decent but this was the first Thai that was truly good.   Deserts are also amazing, homemade, and large size for the value.  Whenever I go to Thai or Indian, I always order an 8.  Usually the 8 is not spicy.  I respect this place for actually making an 8 spicy and not totally degrading the value of a True 1 to 10 scale.   (This however should be a warning that if you are not a fan of spice, order a lower number than you are accustomed to.)   Restaurant is also very accommodating to Vegetarians and Vegans.  If you want good Thai in Pittsburgh, this is the place.",

    "text": "Working in town, I've given this place more than a fair shot, ordering maybe 5 or 6 times, and I'm finally ready to give up on it.  One thing I can say for sure is it's incredibly inconsistent. Almost each time I've ordered the same thing and each time I've gotten a different result; sometimes it's a passable Thai dish but more often it seems to rank with some of the worst I've had.  The main problem here is that it's bland, SO bland that it's practically inedible.  I'm not usually one to order above a 3 in most Thai restaurants, but I ordered my most recent takeout HOT thinking at least some kick would be in there.  The server on the phone told me I did not want a hot, but a medium.  Not quite sure what happened there, or since when servers advise you on what you should be ordering without asking them.  However, since I usually order a medium anyway I rolled with it.  Then I went to pick up my order on my lunch break and the real fun began.  First they tried to charge me $30 because they mixed up my order with another individual's,  Once we finally got that sorted out, I realized my baggy was labeled \"mild-medium.\"  Without the time to try to further explain that mix up and send it back as I still had to walk back to work, I figured it would be close enough and headed back. NOPE. THE most bland dish I've ever had, absolutely disgusting.  I understand it said \"mild-medium\" but there were NO spices at all in the dish, absolutely none.  I'm really quite amazed that this place can stay open between the inconsistency and poor customer service, let alone get the seemingly raving reviews on here.  I'd much rather just wait and grab Thai food for dinner from Smiling Banana Leaf or Bangkok Balcony.  Give this place a try if you're feeling adventurous, but if you're used to real Thai food, prepare to be disappointed.",
