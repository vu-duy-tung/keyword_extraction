    "text": "I have been a Panera customer for years now. I love their food because it's clean, simple, and pretty healthy compared to fast food. I love their coffee and that you can sit there for a while and work. And I love that their prices are not too expensive and you don't even have to pay tip. So when it comes to Panera, I usually have nothing bad to say.   HOWEVER, this Panera was a pretty big disappointment. NEVER in my life have I experienced worse customer service. Although some employees are okay, overall, the staff is just TERRIBLE. I've been there several times and it is just ridiculous. Some of the previous reviews say that they are understaffed but I don't always think that's the case. Once when there were hardly any customers, it took almost 5 minutes before someone even took my order because they were all in the back and didn't see me at the register waiting. And they don't always refill the coffee pots, even when there aren't that many customers. Once it took them almost half an hour before they realized the pots were empty but they had in been the back and didn't notice. They are almost always in the back or even just sitting in some of the booths.  My worst experience was with this girl at the register who was taking my order and she had the worst attitude ever. She was just plain miserable and did not want to be there. She was leaning on the counter and resting her head. Not ONCE did she even look up at me. Her voice was completely monotone and she was sighing every other sentence. I did not want to even hand her my money because she was so rude.   But it is not ALWAYS this bad. There are some employees that are friendly and smiling but the bad seeds are just making everyone look bad. This Panera REALLY needs to go over customer service with their staff and pick out the bad apples because, as you can tell from their ratings, they keep falling.    To end on a good note, the food there is pretty good. They don't skimp out on anything. Even when I order a salad, it is a pretty good amount because they give everything in good portions (including salad dressing sometimes, which isn't always good). Some of the reviews say that they take a really long time to make the food but I've never experienced that (yet...).   Food: 4 stars - you really get your bang for your buck but it's just the salad dressing that kills me... Bad seeds: -5 stars - they are PRETTY bad Good seeds: 4 stars - they are pretty nice and I've never had a problem with them Location: 4 stars - I like Bakery Square, although I mostly only go to the LA Fitness and Panera there Parking: 5 stars - Bakery Square has 1 hour parking in front and a garage that has 3 hours of free parking Overall: 2 stars",

    "text": "I would like to begin with the fact that the food did taste very good, but the one star pertains to the service.   Cafe number: 202339  Date and Time of transaction: Aug. 27th, 2017. 5:02:54 P.M.  Check Number: 121470    We ordered a chipotle chicken avocado melt, an extra side of macaroni and cheese for myself, and two items for the \"pick 2\" meal deal for my wife.  When taking our order, the cashier (who seemed to be new) did not notify us that one of our items did not qualify for my wife's \"pick 2\" meal, so we were charged full price for an expensive entree when we had communicated that we specifically wanted to do the \"pick 2\" meal deal for her order. We did not notice this problem until we were leaving, but the bigger issue I experienced made me feel unwelcome and unable to bring a complaint to the supervisor.   When we received our food, I brought it to the table, bit into my chipotle chicken avocado melt, and noticed it was missing avocado. I went back to the service station, and while waiting, I saw a customer complaining that they did not receive their baguette - a side dish that comes with most meals. The two people behind the counter rudely told him off, said that he was a scammer, and told him to leave. I do not know the truth of these assertions, but this was no way to speak about a patron in front of other customers. When the person left, appearing very upset about the situation, I went up with my sandwich and receipt and told them that they had forgotten my avocado. I opened the sandwich for them to show that it was missing avocado, and I asked if they could remake my sandwich. The two persons behind the counter seemed upset about the request and said that they cannot take it back, and kept talking about \"customers\" (as in plural - not the singular customer from before, but multiple customers now) trying to scam free things. I said I was not trying to scam them, but the person nearest the counter sarcastically said they were not talking about me and continued to discuss the issue while gesturing toward me. They then said they would not remake my sandwich but would give me half an avocado. The other person behind the counter cut half of an avocado into two pieces, diced one of the quarters, and gave me both the diced and the not-diced avocado pieces.   I felt incredibly upset about the situation, and did not want to raise any more of a fuss in person because of being humiliated by these servers. My wife and I finished out meal (we had not eaten in several hours and were very hungry) and left. During the meal, I had looked at the receipt and noticed that we had been charged the full price for one of her entrees.   Once we left, I called Panera Bread customer services and lodged a complaint. I explained the situation and they told me I would receive a call back in two business days about the ordeal, and I was asked if my call could be used for training purposes because of how serious these problems were. I consented to the training question, yet, I never received a call from the store. I called again today and was not satisfied with the response, which amounted to, \"They are a franchise. I will send the complaint again. Have a nice day.\" I gave them ample opportunity to contact me to discuss the problem, and they failed to make that effort.  Update: I called the store today and spoke to a supervisor. They were very understanding of the situation. They offered to provide us two free meals or coupons, both of which I declined. They seemed to take the problem seriously and said they would address the problems with the manager who was in charge that day, as well as the associates who were on staff. My review still stands as it is an accurate reflection of how I experienced the restaurant, but I may give this establishment another chance in the future.",

The location at Bakery Square is no different. Conveniently large space located amidst the trendy and expanding Bakery Square, attached to the Spring Hills Hotel it is a great place to grab a coffee or bagel.   The decor standard, there are adequate amounts of tables and booths depending on the size of your party, however only few of the booths in the back are besotted with electrical outlets. [they don't want you hanging out here all day every day after all]. The service is quick and friendly. The menu is a little overwhelming for me personally and ever changing. Sometimes for the better [Pasta dishes] sometimes for the worst [what happened to my favorite Chicken BBQ and Chipotle Salad!!!!]  I especially love their involvement in the community donating some of their proceeds to various causes such as Breast Cancer Awareness Month with the Ribbon Bagel or the Annual Puppy Walk in the Summer time.

The you-pick-two combo is one of my favorite go to comfort meals - you can't go wrong with a sandwich  and French onion soup.  Where you CAN go wrong is the customer service and boy did this place disappoint on that front. One girl manning the registers during a busy time of evening? Not only that but I think she was in training, as someone occasionally came up to explain things to her. (Why not stay up there and help her, I must ask?)   After ten minutes I finally got to order, although I'm glad the girl read it back to me seeing as I had to correct what she put down twice. Food was standard for Panera and the building itself was really lovely. But the level of service was definitely unforgivable, especially since I've seen even busier Panera's handle orders a LOT faster. Go to another location if you can!",

I also know that when potential customers are around and you're at your place of business you're to act appropriate and represent said business.  I'm staying at the Spring Hill Suites on business and it's my first time in Pittsburgh.  I stopped at the Panera under the hotel for a drink this morning and the service and employees were lovely.  I came back for dinner later that night (10/27) when I got off work. The food was okay. My flatbread was burnt and sloppily thrown together. That's whatever. It still tasted good. Later, around quarter after nine I came down to sit outside and relax. Employees brought out a ton of food and bread and I'm assuming it was being donated or something? I don't know.  As I sat there the two young me (employees im assuming, they weren't in uniform) came back to the door it was locked because they're closed.  They started POUNDING on the door screaming and cursing and acting like just animals. Loud enough to catch the cop (who was on the other side of the area) walk down to see what the heck was going. The girl employees were laughing not letting them in. So they continued to act like animals banging and screaming on the door. I'm sorry, but it was completely unacceptable. I wasn't 10 feet away from them and they're acting like this.  It was just odd and unacceptable. The cop walked over and they were let in and asked me if they're supposed to be in there. I honestly said that I had no idea.  It was just loud, annoying and ridiculous. Sorry.",

Generally, Paneras are pretty similar -- food is good, delivery is fast, and service is adequate. I believe that the food, delivery, and service at this Panera are what I would come to expect from the chain.   What I really appreciate about this location is the very large dining room. Instead of feeling that I'm practically sitting on top of someone, this location allows patrons to spread out and have more privacy. Plus, this is a nice little plaza! After filling our bellies with Bacon Turkey Bravos, Caesar Salads, or Broccoli Cheese soup, my husband and I split up, with him heading over to Coffee Tree Roasters and with me to Anthropologie. Everyone is happy!",

I drive a hybrid, and there is always a huge SUV parked in my favorite hybrid parking spot. Boo.  Of course the food and drinks are the same as you will find at any Panera, so it's always dependable when you're looking to grab a quick salad or smoothie, but because of the ridiculous parking situation, I can't give it any more than 3 stars.",

    "text": "I've been to Panera so many times, all my experiences have just blended together to create one big memory blob. I will base my review of this Panera from that memory blob.  I walk through a set of double doors. I stroll past several couples dining of their sandwiches and salads, and a handful of solo coffee drinkers wearing their headphones and glaring at their laptop screens. I stop close enough from the cashiers to let them know that I am, indeed, a customer, but not too close to give them the impression that I am ready to order. I argue with myself: \"Do I want the You-Pick-Two? That sounds good, but do I want a sandwich, salad, or soup? Oh gosh, they changed the menu! That new seasonal salad looks good...so does that soup...and the sandwich. Wait, do I get a regular sandwich or a panini? Argh, I still need to decide on the second item! And a drink! Ahh!\"  After another minute, I finally place my order. I take my receipt and the buzzer, get a glass of water, and find a seat (booth or table? Decisions decisions...). Once the buzzer goes off, I get my tray and sit back down. The presentation is quite nice, The soup is piping...warm? Okay, good enough. The salad looks great! I'm glad I got my dressing on the side; they sometimes drench my salad in dressing.  Fast forward to after I finish my meal. The salad lettuce was crunchy and fresh; the toppings were nice and tasty; the apple chips were okay, but got a little soggy when I added the dressing. I can't complain about the soup, except maybe it was a little watery (I'm talking about the garden vegetable soup for those wondering). Okay, time to clean up. Okay, what goes where again? Right, utensils in the small rectangular bin (*drop drop*); bowls in the larger bin...but I need to clean up the leftovers (blah! *spill drop bang bang bang*); napkins in the trash; tray on top. Okay, my hands are all gross now. Time to wash them....all washed! Time to go home!  Well, I hope you enjoyed my somewhat disorderly thought processes in this review! Essentially, my experience at almost every Panera is the same. Decent food, nice staff, really good coffee, and good desserts. Breakfast isn't anything special; just overpriced oatmeal and breakfast sandwiches. I would rather make them at home instead of getting them here.",

Most of the time, there was only one person working on the line assembling food. My cashier also left abruptly while I was waiting for my receipt, and then informed me that I didn't need one when she finally came back. Um, okay?

My visits to this location have been as expected and on par with other locations.  There were a couple of issues I witnessed right after they first opened, where the cooks weren't sure what went on some of the breakfast sandwiches, but those details seem to have been ironed out.  The space is a little small, and is a bit oddly set up, but it seems to work.  I can imagine though that if it gets really crowded, trying to get back to the pick up counter would be challenging.

Not a big deal, I just filled up with the one they had and let one of the staff know. He shrugged and didn't say anything. Buzzer never went off so after about 10 minutes, I went up to the pick up counter and found my wrap sitting there. Awesome. Forgot the bagel I'd ordered for takeout, I asked an employee if I could have the bagel I'd ordered, he said I could get it at the front bakery. I told him the employee that had taken my order said nothing walked over towards the bagels and then played on her phone instead of getting a bagel. He says he's going to go get me a bagel, comes back they're out of Everything bagels. As with not having coffee, not having bagels isn't a huge deal for a cafe. Anyway, I get a plain bagel in it's place. I open the bagel when I get back to work and it's easily 80% hole.",

Called Panera again and was told \"it's busy and we can not determine how many orders we get\". \"We can either cancel your order or you can wait for your food\". This was terrible customer service.

While I was eating it I thought to myself I should take this shit back to the counter lol, but I didn't!  I've been here many times and they have made very few mistakes on orders.  I've eaten at a lot of PB locations, but mostly this one because it's convenient for me.  I love the pick two deals and the variety of options you can choose.  My favorite menu item would be the chicken poppyseed salad, but it's only available during summer months.  PB offers a cozy dining ambience with a fireplace and plenty of seating.  I often see people having business meetings, interviews, students studying and such.  They offer free wifi inside.  Be sure to sign up for the My Panera card if you're a frequent customer...  12/7/17 - Today's service was at an all time slow and low today!  I love this PB location, but today I was left very dissatisfied!  Waiting much longer than usual at the pick-up counter, you can hear nothing but teenager staff goofing off.  I ordered a double Pick 2, one for eat in and one to go.  Neither order had a baguette which I had to ask them for.  I ordered two Bacon Turkey Bravo sandwiches that were served without bacon.  Let's just say that the staff today deserved no \"bravo\" for their poor performance!  To make it worse, I tipped the cafe team via the new option on the kiosk when you pay for your order.  I asked for a butter knife and receive one of the dirtiest pieces of silverware ever.  I literally had to scrape it clean with my thumb nail before running it under water at the beverage counter and polishing it with a napkin.  WTF PB...get it together!!",
