The delivery was relatively quick and the customer service was great. I will definitely order again. The size large is not as big as i thought it would be, but the thick slices are more filling than typical round pizza. They also have great ranch dressing.",

I think chain pizza isn't worthy enough to give to your dog...chances are your cat wouldn't eat it anyways.  and....to top it off, this is placed in Dormont, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF PIZZA OASIS.  With Camps, Fiori's and Mineo's all in a 5 minute drive, why would you ever go here?  Why in the world would they build this here of all places?  These questions seem almost as impossible to answer as me giving Jet's 5 stars but...here we are.  This chain pizza is now the ONLY chain cut I will ever eat.  Their deep dish is totally out of this world.  It really is magical.  Their salads are meh....but you aren't really going here for a salad are you?  Treat yourself, make sure you get their deep dish.  Make sure you get corner cuts.  Make sure you add some topics and crust flavorings.  Make sure you try Jet's...I promise you that as skeptical as you are...as was I...you will be smiling like you just won the game, found a parking spot, hit the lottery, banged th......  you get it.",

We currently live in Morgantown, WV so finding a Jet's Pizza within an hour of us was both a stroke of luck and the one of the best things ever. This out of Michigan Jet's tastes just like the real thing (as it should). It was just awesome and reminded us of home. My advice is to get an 8 corner or two and Jet's bread...one of the best pizza joints ever..",

    "text": "Well, they deliver, and they do a mighty fine job at it. A cordial, fresh-faced courier was at our doorstep with a bunch of food in his arms on a snowy afternoon, and when the crew goofed and the manager came out personally to present us with the cinnamon sticks we ordered instead of the cheesy bread sticks they sent (and they aren't worth a dissertation), I was impressed.  The food, however, wasn't so swift.   I can't say I was disappointed, since I knew that what this 37 year-old chain peddles couldn't be too delectable. When I saw the Jet's franchise being built in Banksville Plaza and that Super Mario Brothers reject of a flying mascot they have, I kinda figured we were in for some crummy food.   It was edible and not much else. The Italian hoagie I had came in its own nifty rectangular, foil-lined box, and in lieu of a bun, the innards of the hero were contained by two slices of a crostini/bruschetta-like garlic bread. However, aside from the innovative presentation and construction, not to mention the somewhat generous deli meats, the flavors were absent.   Also bought was a deep dish pizza that recalled a halfway point between Pizza Hut and Dominos. The crust was thick, crispy, and buttery, and that's about all it had going for it. The cheese and the sauce were there but only as a matter of fact. In terms of taste, I might as well have been eating an English muffin.   I've had mall churros that were better than Jet's cinnamon sticks. We could have run up to the market, purchased a box of something similar, and nuked them at home. They tasted like some giant frozen food conglomerate's experiment involving the elementary school demographic and breakfast.   Keep the food, and gimme me that sweet jet pack, jack.",

I went back into the store and tried to tell someone about it but their employees conversations with each other are more important than the customer. After at least 3 minutes of excuse me's this rude girl came to the counter and said \"what.\" Not can I help you. I guess she was mad she had to work. I explained they got the order wrong..no apology...just this is what I show you ordered.i told her I had the receipt, gave her the food back and told her to refund my money. I get that every one makes mistakes but don't treat a customer wrong when you are clearly at fault. An apology goes a very long way. Here's a great suggestion Jets...teach your employees customer service. I won't be back and I can promise that I have and will continue to tell everyone I know of this experience.",

We walked in & started looking at the menu on the wall. The cashier was very nice & gave us an easier menu to look at. With the cahier knowing that we've never been there, he explained where their pizza originated from as well the items on the menu. It wasn't a long drawn out explanation, but just enough to get our taste buds watering! They have special for 2 slices & a pop, so I had to partake.

    "text": "I was told this was the place that I absolutely had to try.  Without reading any written reviews I opted to see for myself.  First thought.  Not what I envisioned as I spotted the place.  Still determined to discover what this recommendation was all about we placed our order with a little guidance from the employee manning the counter.  Talk about options when ordering a pizza!  They do simplify it by using a step be step process allowing you to order it your way. Start with the size, topping choice, choice of pizza crust (deep dish, hand tossed, NY style and thin).  For an extra bonus you can flavorize  your crust with no additional cost.  7 flavor options available.  I never mixed poppy seed with my pizza but I am willing to give it a try sometime. Apparently, most people order the turbo crust. This is made up of butter, garlic, and romano  cheese.  They also have 11 types of specialty pizzas as well.  The Jet 10 comes with cheese, pepperoni, ham, hamburger, Italian sausage, bacon, mushrooms, onions, green pepper and black olives. Another specialty pizza is the  8 corner pizza.  No fighting for the corners on this one!  In addition to some great pizza options, they also offer salads, boneless wings, subs and cheese bread sticks. We opted to try a slice of the deep dish because this style was available by the slice.  We ordered a large NY style to go.  The menu prices are in line with most other pizza places. The deep dish slice tasted very good and it had a wonderful texture.  Not a heavy doughy crust yet it was thick, crunchy and light tasting.  Very pleasing.  Not something I would order consistently as my go to pizza but it would be something I crave repeatedly over time. The NY style was  average and had very little taste to it..  I noticed they promote the fact that there are 350 locations.  Overall, I am planning to revisit Jet's Pizza and give some of the other menu options a try.",

Their sauce is great, not overly sweet, and works well with the cheese and toppings.  They do a nice job with the cheese amount (which is quite a bit), and the whole mix just works.   Their round pizza is less distinctive but is still very good. The crust is not floppy, but almost still without being crispy. Again, I love their sauce. The rest is pretty standard but well balanced in the portions.   I also like this Jets because they have helped our high school band several times. They are supportive of our very large orders and when they deliver all the pizzas, they make sure we have everything we need before they leave. Thank you, Jets.",

When I opened the top of the pizza box it was literally nothing but a pool of grease. The delivery guy was nice and it arrived hot and early so no issues there but, man, the quality is just not up to snuff. I also ordered light sauce and that didn't happen either. Looks like this \"jet\" didn't even clear the runway.",

The crust was buttery and crunchy but soft and fluffy at the center. I like sweet sauce and this place did it well. Is it the best? No...but it's worth the stop and some revisits. They also deliver which is another plus.   Here's where it gets good though...  The service was AMAZING! Once the gentleman at the counter found out it was our first visit there, he took his time to explain their menu. Very engaging and I could tell he was really proud of their food.  He even said if we wanted our pizza cooked lighter to let him know and he'd redo the order with a less crunchy crust. It was perfect though and everyone ordering with me enjoyed it. Please support this place. There's not a ton of places that offer excellent customer service these days. When great service is combined with a great product, it's a win in my book.",

    "text": "When I first saw Jets Pizza taking over the old Bruster's, I thought, \"ugh, ANOTHER pizza place.\" It took years for me to finally give it a try and I will say, the pizza is pretty awesome. I've never tried their round pizzas but the square/rectangular ones are great. Now, this isn't your authentic pizza or anything. It's more like thick, extremely buttery, bread topped with thick sweet sauce, loaded with a thick layer of cheese and pepperoni if you so choose. So basically, it's thick on everything. On top of that, you can \"flavorize\" your crust by adding even more cheese/spices. However, I will say they skimp a little on the pepperoni. What I like so much about their pizza is the bottom and outer edges are perfectly crispy while the center is perfectly soft, as bread usually is. It's such a nice contrast in texture for every bite. A thing to note is that it's mostly a takeout place so don't plan on eating here.   Although I still can't say Jet's is my favorite pizza chain, Jets definitely hits the spot when you're craving \"fake,\" all around terrible for you, pizza.",

I love the thick crispy crust the most - it has the perfect amount of crunch but is also relatively soft and easy to chew. The nice thick crust helps you feel full without having to have too many slices. Best crust ever.  Second to the crust they also have this extra tasty cheese which I swear is better than other pizza places. I like how it is super melty and flavorful without being too oily. I also like that they don't put too much on their pizza - just the perfect amount. I also like the tanginess of the tomato sauce which contrasts nicely with the salty cheese. Award winning combo.   You can also add garlic and parmesan to the crust at no additional charge or several of the other seasonings including sesame and poppy seeds. Yum!",

You do pay for extra toppings, delivery fee, and tax, but still a great deal for around $5.   The person who answered the phone was awesome, polite, and helpful. There Re many choices but I customized my crust \"turbo\" and added mushrooms and onions to my pizza.  I loved the crust to the pizza, but honestly the cheese and toppings weren't for me. I almost felt as though the vegetables were just bagged and frozen, for me.. I love fresh vegetables on my pizza, makes a huge difference. They also used white onion rather than red (urgh)  My pizza arrived quickly, and again, delivery driver was super nice.   I'm glad I received the coupon and tried this place, but I'll be checking out some other spots around the area. Their pizza didn't necessarily knock my socks off.",

Very comparable to Little Caesars pan pizza. The corners get caramelized and crunchy without greasiness. Really good pizza!   Fast free delivery too.",

    "text": "Jets serves square deep-dish style pizza in Dormont and it's one of my new favorites! The crusty is crispy on the edges and you can pick from a variety of different flavors for the crust. It's kind of expensive if you create your own, but they have a deal on mondays for a large with one topping for $8.99. I've also had their Greek salad and it's very good too. It's always been ready in under 30 minutes and they offer online ordering and delivery. They don't have any seating in the restaurant.",
