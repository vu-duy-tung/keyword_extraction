It was an awesome place to hangout, waiter was very decent and humorous. Drinks were must to be tried and comments in the menu were so funny, we almost tried every drink on the menu  we enjoyed having fun with menu, this made us feel like we are waiting for the food, they are quick though. Food was very delicious, am in love with it. Would recommend visiting this place. Would go again!!",

The frozen mimosa is a terrible idea. The hollandaise on my eggs Benedict came out of a squirt bottle. Incredibly overpriced. Could've had much better bottomless mimosas and real eggs Benedict for cheaper somewhere else. Very disappointed in our experience as a whole. Will not return.",

The beverage manager needs to learn his/her job!! Then, the food came. I got the Delmonico steak sandwich. So grisly and over cooked it was terrible.

It should've been a sign that the only other table seated before us had to get up and find someone to inquire about when their lunch would be ready. We finally order and after a ~20 minute wait 3 of our 4 lunches are served. I didn't get an explanation except mine would be ready \"soon\". The manager stops by and explains that the waitress forgot to enter my order but they were working on it and it would be out ASAP. When it was served it had onions (I asked for no onions), the turkey was kind of grey, the roll was hot and the turkey was frozen. I sent the sandwich back. The waitress came back to explain that it was a cold sandwich but they could heat it if I'd like. It wasn't cold - it was frozen -and the roll was hot. I sent it back for good while my friends finished their lunches. The best thing I can say is that they took it off the bill without asking.",

I must say, we were more than happy with the food, the drinks, the service. It was all excellent!! The food was spot on great. The waitress was very friendly, and even a manager asked how things were! And the pricing was great. 2 beers, 2 meals for around 40.00. We will make the Harris grill a regular stop while in the city.

It was devoid of customers and when I asked if they ever get busy, was told happy hour and lunch are their busiest times but other than that no.  One of their salads is delicious and what I ordered. It had candied roasted nuts, feta, some type of berry, and a sweet vinaigrette. I added salmon on top, and it was perfection and just what I was craving.  I liked it so much that I came back the next day to order it again! This time however, the salad wasn't that great. To be clear- the salmon on the salad wasn't that great. It was undercooked, and seemed to be old due to the grey tinge to the top of it (it wasn't the skin/scales not being properly taken off either). Thankfully they took the salmon charge off the salad (since I did eat the rest of it), and that was sincerely appreciated!  Rest assured, I will be back for a 3rd shot! Everyone has their off days :)",

The food options were awesome, and I would definitely come back to try more of them, but I ended up with the mac & cheese, which the waiter told me won the city-wide competition. I always get worried when it's been broiled or baked that it will be too dry, but right underneath that crispy topping, was the creamiest, pepper-iest mac & cheese...I was very happy with it, and it wasn't too filling for a lunch option.",

Pretty much a burger deep fried with chipotle sauce and fries! So out of the box but worth the risk to try! The servers are always friendly and they have happy hour specials between 4 and 6pm!

We won't be back as there are many options at nearby Market Square that do not allow smoking in their outside dining areas.  If you are a non-smoker, I would not recommend eating here - at least not on the deck.",

We arrived more than 1/2 hr before the kitchen closed, were promptly greeted and seated. It was almost empty of customers. More than 15 min. later the server came by; we let him know we were getting drinks and were ready to order food. The server brought the drinks and left. After waiting for him to finally take our order, another 10 min. after that he returns to let us know they can't make the food item I ordered (out of ingredients) and then rushed me to choose something else immediately since the kitchen was supposed to be closed. The food was above-average, and the manager apologized about the food. The interactions with the server though was what took away from the experience.",

    "text": "We decided to give this place a try thanks to its great Yelp reviews. It didn't disappoint. We took indoor seating because we were starving and didn't want to wait for the rooftop. The inside is really cool with lots of awesome artwork and a nice bar. I did the build your own bowl option, and my boyfriend got the steak sandwich. We split the calamari as app. All of the food was good, and I loved that I could customize my entree. The beer list was great, although they were out of our original choices. My only complaint is that the service was a little slow. Definitely a fun place to check out, though.",

    "text": "A sister restaurant to Harris Grill Shadyside and Shiloh Grill on Mt. Washington, this is a very welcome addition to the downtown dining scene, as it has a great casual vibe that included a rooftop patio and really good unpretentious food at reasonable prices. The menu is extensive and includes a comic sense of humor throughout. In addition to appetizers, salads, entrees, burgers and sandwiches, there's several mac'n cheese dishes and a \"build your own bowl\" (of food) that can be a fun experience. There's even \"church basement pierogies\" on it! Service and decor is appropriately casual. The rooftop patio isn't gigantic and the view is cool, but not stunning, but nonetheless, it's awesome to have a rooftop patio at a casual restaurant in downtown as opposed to the urban rooftops with cocktails starting at $10.",

Drinks sub par and the overall atmosphere was just not anything special. Decent place for a quick drink for sure. Let's talk about food service. I try to be understanding and kind when it comes to servers and the food industry as a whole. But wow I have NEVER experienced a worse service than this restaurant. I came here for lunch on 3 separate occasions last year and was waiting for my order for AT LEAST 1 hour each time and it is not even that busy to be honest. One time it was 1 hour and 30 minutes (it was more busy). Luckily we had time to kill but totally unacceptable in theory. The Pittsburgh salad was not good and any other time I've eaten here the food has just been average. I haven't been back in a long time and have no desire to. The service is just so bad that you cannot even bother risking going here because it isn't that great anyway. the food is  not awful, but the service is so awful that you don't even want to come.",

Thank you for letting me sit outside but not have to roast in the sun! The menu is pretty identical to their other location, with perhaps a few updates. For bar food, it's a bit pricey, but comparable to many other places downtown with nice sized-portions.  We planned a little surprise lunch for a friend of mine and the staff did a great job with helping us pull it off. They had appetizer orders ready shortly after we arrived and our server, Brittany did an amazing job taking care of our whole party. The mac and cheese is always creamy and delicious-- it's really hard for me not to order it every single time. I also had the short-rib quesadilla which was very good!   If you visited here when it was Tavern 245, you know to expect a lot of steps, especially if you are venturing all the way up to the patio area!",

We ordered the sauce on the side but after tasting it, I could've rolled around in the stuff....it was good. Steak sandwich arrived with fresh condiments on the side. The steak was tender and seasoned very well under the large ciabatta like bun....yum! The crabcake sammie was good too and had minimal filler. I would've enjoyed just a bit more filler to keep it all together but that didn't impact the flavor or quality one but. Mac and cheese is rightous...that stuff is creamy and cheese covered and filled every noodle...yes! The tater totties were crispy, salty (in a good way) and crunchy. They were your average tots and was a nice flavor and texture contrast from the soft crabcake.   The frozen cosmo...mannnnn, can I get a \"what , what....?\" This cute little pink drink came out and after one sip, I knew they meant business. Fresh, slightly sweet and strong which makes it the perfect wind down to the evening.   It was a wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back!!!",

The reason I can't remember was because I was overwhelmed with pleasure when I sunk my teeth into the side of Mac n Cheese. Besides that whatever sandwich I had my friend had the other and we both insisted sharing bites. Yum yum yum when can I go back and get me some !!!!",

It was extremely frustrating to pay over $60 in takeout and have to put everything in the microwave because it was so cold.

We got seated right away in their bar area and they had tons of specials going on for the day.  We ordered some drinks and some food and settled in to have fun with the other patrons.  Our food was delicious - I got the fish and chips and my husband a burger.  We did start with their artichoke dip to accompany the drinks.  Not a bad bite of food!  Our waitress was very outgoing, kept our drinks flowing and the conversation.",

We had a large group coming in from out of town (~20 people), looking for last minute accommodations for a large party on a Saturday night.  There weren't a lot of options but Harris was able to accommodate our party.  It was a bit of a walk from where we were staying, but we didn't have many options.  This turned out to be very fortunate.  First, let me start by thanking our server, Amber (and the other person who was assisting given the size of the party), who were absolutely awesome.  As we had several small groups (meaning several different checks), sat at different tables (so kids could sit with kids), etc.  I'm sure it would have normally been an accounting nightmare, but she was totally on top of it and was by so frequently nobody was ever waiting for a refill, request or otherwise.  Second, the food was great.  The menu is fun and everyone enjoyed what they got.  I had the lobster mac & cheese, phenomenal if your diet allows for it.  It also had a nice beer selection.  We had such a great experience that should we be in town again, this will be the first place I call to attempt to make a reservation.  Thanks again everyone there that night from the staff to the kitchen, you guys were great.",

I don't really keep up on things like that but after working downtown for a bit now I stumbled upon them!   I am pleased that the menu stayed the same. The food as always is very good. I came with a large work party and we were able to score a seat on the balcony in the third floor. Bathrooms are on the 2nd floor so just be prepared for that.  Our party ordered, I believe everything on the apps page and then individual dinners. I just went with the wings after eating that many apps.   My favorite app was the spinach dip and the skillet mac and cheese. Both were very good. The mac and cheese had a nice crisp top and very cheesy, no watered down barely cheesed noodles here! The spinach dip was packed full of flavor and the warm pita chips were divine.  I got two orders of wings. 1. The garlic parm wings and the 2. Chimichurri wings. I liked both. But I will say I think maybe the chimichurri wings were a bit hotter than I expected. It was either them or the one mild wing I tried but my lips were burning! Wowwie. Now all the wings were good, but man, I was not expecting that flavor punch.  This was a fun spot to hang at. I look forward to coming here again.",

Enter and head up the stairs for the Harris Grille as Tinsel Town is on the lower level. The menu is super cool with lots of fun names and descriptions for food which makes it unique. Vegetarian/pescatarian friendly for those who don't eat meat. We were seated immediately even on a busy Saturday night as this is a little away from the main Market Square action. Cleanliness of the restaurant seemed average and this is not a new place.   The buffalo cauliflower wings had good taste but were pretty greasy compared to others I've had has the breading did not seem to be staying on. The fish tacos were okay but I'd probably try something else when I come back. Vegetarian chili was definitely good and I'd get it again, but it's definitely not very spicy.   Average place with average meal. The coolest thing is the menu but my food didn't live up to my expectations unfortunately. Don't get me wrong, definitely not bad and I would come back so if you're in Market Square and need a place to grab food without a long wait, check it out!",

Some came in a martini glass, some came in a rocks glass, one came half filled in a pint glass. We laughed about it, but it was little odd. At least standardize what you serve one table.   I like this place, and it's always a good place to pop in for one or two drinks to waste time before heading home. I'd be curious to pop in for lunch.",

I visited on a Sunday. They only had the breakfast buffet taking place. We weren't aware of it until we were already seated and our server came over (which was about 10 minutes into our visit.)The buffet use to include eggs make to order. Our server informed us it no longer did. I was pretty disappointed because it's the same cost as when that was included. The buffet does include one alcoholic beverage - a frozen mimosa or a Bloody Mary. I always get the frozen mimosa.   We get up to the buffet and it's basically empty. The food that is there does not look fresh at all. The space isn't very large and it wasn't crowded so I'm not sure why the food wasn't maintained better. After sitting down we came to find out some of the food was also cold.   I can't imagine I'll be stopping again. I really love the Harris Grill in Shadyside, I just think this one is underwhelming.",

My fiance and I dined here with a couple of our friends a few months back and we had a great time!  We weren't expecting much at first because the building is a little non-descript and the restaurant is upstairs.  When we arrived we were the only ones there and we weren't 100% sure they were even open.  We saw an employee and she seated us right away and confirmed that we could get our lunch on!  The menu is quite expansive.  They have so many delicious items to choose from.  They also have an excellent cocktail menu.  We were all so excited about the wide variety.    I went with the Henny Penny and it was delicious.  Everyone really enjoyed their food.  The service was a little slow but also very good.  We also really loved the quirky interior.

Inside there are booths that span the middle of the restaurant as well as along the side that run parallel to the main bar area.  There are also TVs for your enjoyment. The menu is pretty similar to the other two restaurants. My husband ordered a chicken Caesar salad and I ordered a roasted vegetable salad. Since we arrived early we got our food fairly quickly. I liked how the vegetable tasted and included beets. My husband told me his chicken was hard to cut at the beginning but for the most part was fairly tender.  Our waitress looked after us and was very attentive to our needs.  I don't frequent downtown that often due to parking but on free holiday Sats it gave us a chance to get away from all the holiday crowds around Market Square and still have a descent lunch.  Located on 4th Ave near Wood St, it is definitely worth a visit if you willing to spend a little extra for lunch but not go overboard.",

I enjoyed their wings but they're not spectacular and I only got 5. Um. What. They should tell you not to get that as an entree, btw. I really disliked their Huevos Ranchos as it was absolutely way too spicy.  The brunch special is $18 when you get ONE drink and then your meal. I could go elsewhere and get bottomless brunch drinks for $18 and better food. And their service is really something to be desired. Anyway, their Mac and cheese is good, though.
