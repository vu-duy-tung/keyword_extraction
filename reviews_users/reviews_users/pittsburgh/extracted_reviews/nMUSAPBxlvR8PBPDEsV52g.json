I don't know if they make their bread in house as well, but it was some of the best bread I have had for a sub. I have always said better bread better subs. You have to swing in here and check it out. The sandwiches are simple, but shoot if you make a sandwich this straight forward and it kicks this much butt, who needs anything else. I'm not really sure if the \"fresh cut\" meats make a difference but it certainly adds to the experience. I think this could really be a five star place if their sides were a little bit better. I tried the potatoe salad and was disappointed as there really wasn't much to it and it was just bland. Fries would go great with these subs to.",

The minute we walked into the establishment we were dissapointed by the lack of greeting by the unenthusiastic teenage employees, not even attempting to say hello. We were then rushed in to orering our food, even though we were their only customers at the time. We ordered two cheese steaks and a meatball sub, all half hoagies too. We were shocked when our total reached almost $30. After that when looking for a table we relized that the clever and interesting fassad was covered in crumbs and dirt. What a shame. The first bite into my skimpy meatball sub, or should I say, a marinara sauce sandwich, wad disappointing because I was constantly fighting off the annoying crunch of the corn-meal type seeds. By the time I was done I realized that there was probably only one meatball total applied to the inside of the sandwich. For $10 I would expect more. The steak hoagie was dull and tasteless. The best thing about the place was the fountain coke and the pictures of old time Lebo that dawned the walls. Besides that, it was a terribly disappointing meal. New employees and food selections are needed.",

    "text": "The former space of a long-time art dealer has been usurped by a cabal of young bohemians with a passion for the almighty grinder, the sensational submarine, the hallowed hero, the zealous zep, and the bulk of their craft is scratch-made from the bread to the roast beef.   It was the latter that had me salivating, particularly when I was told that there would be a wait since the protein in question was still cooking and the just-baked bread was cooling.   While the meat ended up being slightly dry, I savored the fresh, flaky bread, the artistically laid array of vegetables ( I went berserk with my choices), and the \"Jersey Style\" vinegar/oil/salt/oregano dressing which was what truly shot the torpedo across the ocean and into Jared Fogle's yacht. One hearty hoagie, my only lament was that I didn't go with an Italian since I feel it probably would have been more succulent.  A cup of potato salad proved to be a starchy, creamy success with a bit of celery bringing the crunch. The M&M chocolate chip cookies we had for dessert were crispy, chewy caps of joy that rivaled those of many area bakeries.   I must add that the interiors are bright, contemporary, and inviting, the soda fountain is self-serve, the employees are enthusiastic and engaging, and the meat is sliced to order.   Subway sinks to the ocean floor to be devoured by a Kraken as Blimpie's falls burning from the sky.  The age of Lebo Subs is upon us.",

Nice people, nice service, and good, solid food. The subs are $1-2 more than what I would look for in a place to visit more regularly, but I can't really argue with the spin these folks have taken on the Jersey Mike's formula. Meat's cut to order, toppings added as you wish, and the results were a winner at my place. Line was a little slow the day I stopped in, but that's because they were taking care of customers, not slacking and simply waiting out the timeclock.  Menu and seating may be a little too limited for some, but I think there's enough of both here to give everyone an option that works for them. Pasta salad was an excellent side to add into the mix.  I hope this place sticks as an option in downtown Lebo. I'll certainly stop in again.",

Service is quick, the people are friendly, and the place is clean. What else can you ask for?  A couple of suggestions: It's a tad bit expensive (the half Italian hoagie combo is $11!)  And their \"frequent visitor\" program is confusing. It's not clear how the points get earned or how to redeem. I've eaten here a handful of times and I still don't know when I'll get my free sub, or exactly how the system works.",

I've tried both the roast beef and Italian subs, the latter being my favorite of the two.  I love that they slice the meat and cheese to order so your sandwich looks, feels, and tastes so fresh!  Did I mention that they bake their own bread?  They also let you pile on a variety of toppings, which I usually add way too many of.  I just get so excited for lettuce, tomatoes, banana peppers, olives, pickles, mustard... the list goes on, as does my appetite.  Keep in mind that quality comes at a premium, so don't expect to stroll in here and get a $5 footlong.  You'll pay about $8-14 per sandwich depending on what you get, but trust me when I say it's worth it.  I love a good sandwich and Lebo Subs is a great local option for some quality grub.",

I get the Italian which seems to have a good bit of meat. Their prices seem a little expensive, but once you see how large the subs are, it makes total sense. The half is big enough for two people to share if you get chips or a side to go along with it. I really enjoy the oil, vinegar and Oregano dressing they make. The staff is friendly and they move quick when making the subs. Lebo subs also offers free wifi, which is always a plus. One thing I wish they had was a toaster, but I don't believe they do.

They have plenty of tables. It was pretty filled up on a Saturday afternoon, but I got a table.   I ordered a half roast beef sandwich. Everything was very fresh and well prepared. The quality of the roast beef was excellent and bread very fresh.  The half sandwich is plenty large enough for one person. They prepare the sandwich as you watch and you have a choice of all the standard toppings.   I also got a side of potato salad. This is a home made salad and also very fresh and well prepared. The serving was a little small but adequate as a side with the sandwich.   Prices are reasonable and service friendly. My sandwich and side came to about $10.",

The meat balls had zero flavor, no spices, no nothing. It tasted like straight ground beef that had been dropped on a hot plate. The sauce was just as bland. The bread was the best part. The Italian sub was better, giving the 2 star rating where the meat balls got zero stars. The Italian sub had freshly cut meats and cheese, and decent flavor. The \"homemade \" potato salad was also bland. After adding salt, pepper and a packet of mustard it was better. I've had better potato salad from walmart, much better. Oh yeah, the combos are half sandwiches not full sandwiches. My ticket was over  $26 for both combos. Save your money and hit a subway where at least you get a mediocre sandwich.",
