I had the tee time burger, which had a beef patty excellently paired with a fried egg. The waffle sweet potato fries were pretty tasty, and the server also was very attentive towards me. Overall, the experience was good, but there wasn't a uniquely different vibe that set this sports bar apart from many other good sports bars.",

    "text": "Went for lunch with my boyfriend, since we both work downtown and like to try different places on our lunch hour. The food was ok. I received a different flatbread than the one i ordered. The one I got was fine, and, good thing, because I didn't have time to wait for another to be cooked for me. When I told the waitress (which I HATE HATE HATE complaining about stuff like this anyway, this is what years of working in food service does to a person), but when I told her, she didn't apologize or anything, she just sort of stared at me. And I still got charged for the item. I thought courtesy would at least mean you get your incorrect item half of, at the very least. That's what a lot of other places do anyway.  Just sort of a ho-hum place. Boyfriend ordered a turkey sammy on ciabata bread, and it was nearly all bread. He complained about it being very bland and the turkey not having any flavor.  For $25 for two people, we could have eaten at Six Penn, Cafe Amante... both of which have better service and quality of food.",

The food was fine (not a big fan of canned mushrooms though) and the server was great.  However, mid-meal the manager came around to greet the tables.  Upon approaching our table he asks \"how is everything GENTLEMEN?\"  Although I was offended, I figured this may have been a mistake.  However, when the same manager came by 10 min later and looked the the full glass in front of me with an empty glass next to it - he looked to my coworker and asked \"Sir, is that your drink and you need another or is that hers and she is done with it?\"  I did not realize that in 2014 a manager for customer service would find it necessary to not address a woman directly.  Offended doesn't even begin to explain my outrage.  Unfortunately, I said nothing at the time - although I should have.  But I will never return to be treated so poorly or to patronize an establishment managed by such a blatantly sexist male.",

    "text": "Two Saturday's ago, my husband and another couple went to the city to experience Christmas in Pittsburgh. We were all favorable toward Redbeards prior to, so we decided to go there for dinner. Unfortunately, the experience was a disaster from the moment we walked in. When we arrived, we told them of our reservation which they didn't have for us. The hostess went to the manager and we were told we could be placed in from of everyone, but making a reservation online doesn't guarantee a table that same night... isn't that the point of a reservation?After we got seated,we ordered waters, drinks, and wings as an appetizer. When we got our wings, we received no plates, napkins, or silverware for 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes, one of us went up to ask for plates and napkins. It wasn't until he got back to the table where we realized the plates were dirty with not just residue on them, but sauces and lettuce... this was also after we hadn't gotten any refills for about 10-15 minutes. While we were still waiting patiently for our wraps and burgers that we ordered, the manager came over and said we may be moved because a large party was coming. He beat around the bush by telling us that when our food comes out \"we'll see if we can find you something downstairs\". Unfortunately, he did this to the table of men and women next to us, too. After we told him the sour experience we've been having he kept apologizing, however we'd still maybe have to move because the large party had reservations. When we told the manager we had reservations he asked if we made them on Yelp and ignored the fact. Our friend also told him how slow the service was and that we had to get our own plates and the manager interrupted him saying, \"Yes I gave you those\" enthusiastically, however when we showed him how dirty they were he kept apologizing and asked us to reconsider in the future. My husband, who doesn't anger easily, told him that if they move us we are leaving and the manager seemed fine with that saying they'd cover our expenses! If we weren't waiting so long for our food, it probably would have been our soon and we would have been out of there in time for the large party. The moral of this terrible experience is that the management didn't value us as customers. To disregard our reservations, have poor wait service, be given dirty dishes, and have a manager tell us we need to move so someone else can sit where we are? I've never experienced something like that before. It's a shame because Redbeards won't be getting our money any time soon.",

We had a large party, about 15-20 ppl coming at various times. On the phone they said okay, as this has never been a problem. Well today we get there at 3:45 and as we walk up the steps a gentleman in a blue button down shirt who i assume was the manager starts shooing us back down the stairs telling us we cannot come up there until 4pm. This has never happened. When they finally let us upstairs they had ONE table with about 8 chairs even tho we told them ahead of time how many ppl we had. There were several empty tables surrounding us but we were told we couldn't take them because they were reserved for other people as they expected to be busy due to the pirate game. This was odd to me because we were paying customers and they were making us stand when there were empty tables available? Well no one ever came to occupy them so we ended up just sitting there because standing was getting old. Our waiter did his best considering but the manager was SO RUDE and it ended up being chaotic. I think we'll take our happy hours elsewhere.",

The serving size was great for a late night bite. Each pierogi had its own butter-sauteed red onion ring on it. The sour cream being in the middle helped keep it cold and not melting like some places. My husband had the Greek salad. The feta vinaigarette dressing was so good he was dipping his pita pieces into it and eating them that way. The salad was fresh and he cleaned his plate. We got the Noble Cheesecake for dessert. The texture was very smooth and silky. It was a chocolate caramel swirl topped with whipped cream and a chocolate drizzle. I would definitely take friends here for a late night bite or dinner and drinks during the game.",

It has the layout of a bar, not a restaurant with a bar attached.   I came in and sat at the bar and asked for a screen to be changed to a game I wanted to watch. They obliged; there was not much else going on in sports.   The beer list has about 10 or so drafts, though not everything on their published beer list is in stock. I asked for a Dogfish 60 Minute IPA, but it was out of stock so I ordered a Southern Tier IPA.   The food menu is standard sports bar fare, with a selection of burgers and sandwiches. I ordered a Tuscan chicken sandwich, which was fine, but the menu said it came with steak fries but instead came with chips.   The main problems were in the service area. They had one overtaxed bartender working behind the bar, who had a little trouble keeping up with all her patrons. To top it all off, they committed what I feel was a violation of sports bar etiquette: despite the fact that I specifically asked to watch an NBA game, when the Pirates game started and a patron asked to see the Pirates, they proceeded to turn all six screens to the Pirates game. Despite being a violation of etiquette, it was unnecessary as the bar was not crowded and there weren't Pirates fans throughout the bar.  At other bars I go to, they leave a screen on a game in progress that a patron is watching, or at a minimum they could ask if is OK to switch the game.  This bar would do well to heed that rule.   The prices turned out to be a little on the high side. The IPA was $7 for a draft. That's kind of high, as I can usually get drafts of similar quality for $5.50 or $6.00.",

We opted for the wings.  Your initial order has 10 wings, then refills come in groups of five.  Redbeards has between 10-15 different wing sauces.  The wings were excellent!  Perfectly cooked, ample sauce on the weeks.  I had the buffalo garlic and cajun wings.  Refills came out in a reasonable time.  To top it off, we frequented during happy hour so 3.00 domestic drafts among other well drink/wine specials.  We sat at the bar.  Bartender was friendly, everything seemed very clean and ample TV's.  I will definitely return before Bucco games in the future and hopefully it will be on a Wednesday!  Keep up the good work.",

Servers were great! Had 3 different managers come and talk to us, 2ladies and a big guy, all three were very professional and seemed to be very caring and having fun. Great senses of humor we teased them bout saying y'all instead of yins they were super friendly. Beer was cold, plenty of tv's both upstairs and downstairs. We will for sure be back! It's great to see a crew that smiles and has fun and that all the managers were having fun and smiling also the place was very busy and yet everyone talked to us. Other places need to take a chapter out of Redbeards book, they do it right!! Can't wait for next visit probably going for their ugly Christmas sweater party seems like fun! See \"y'all\" soon Redbeards!",

    "text": "Perfect sports bar. A big screen TV at every angle for any game you want or Sportscenter if you come during the lunch rush (but come early if you want a seat!) Several local and fun beers on tap. Great atmosphere when watching Steelers, Pens , or Pirates. Everyone from the regulars, to the out of towners, to the staff, all get real into what is going on and the energy is infectious. Not to mention awesome food and drink specials before, during and after the games!  One of my favorite places for Happy Hour. Very affordable drink and draft specials 5 days a week. Plus all the fried things your heart can stand for $2 off!  The two best nights of the week are Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Taco Tuesday, with $1 hard shell tacos, has recently expanded to include soft shell and fajitas.( slightly higher priced but still very good deal). On Tuesdays you can wash down your tacos with $3.50 Corona. (My signature beer!) . However, that is still not the best deal of the week, that is on Wednesday. Then you can spend $9.99 for all you can eat wings. Redbeard's has close to 15 or so different wet sauces and dry rubs to try. You are going to have to come every Wednesday for at least  2 months to try them all. They start off with 10 wings, with orders of 5 after that. You also get a side of homemade potato chips.   I highly recommend this place, whether its for a good dinner ( they are more then just barfood, but still have AWESOME bar food) , a drink on your way to the Northshore, or just a chill weeknight out.",

The bar was nice and clean and seated a decent amount.  They have a lot of beers on tap, a lot !! I got my standard Gin Martini, which was very good and under $10.00.  Not bad for a place in the Theater District.   Not sure how the service would be if the place was hopping but for me, on a Sunday afternoon, I sat down and had a drink in less than 3 minutes.   The wait staff and bartenders were 20 somethings so I was privy to the trials and tribulations of a 20 somethings life, but... I found it amusing... kind of took me back to my 20's, well as far back as I can remember.   I would go back again.  It was cozy and clean and they made a good drink.",

Here are the things I liked about it...  -Over the bar there are 6-8 very large screen TVs.  I came in on a night when the Pirates had a chance to clinch a playoff spot and asked if they'd turn on another game for me (I'm not local).  They had no problem with this.  And they were quick about it.  They also have subscriptions to many channels, so it wasn't difficult.  This said, if you want to watch a non-Pittsburgh team, this is the best bar in the city to go  -I sat at the bar.  Wasn't too crowded on a Wednesday night.  Good service and friendly bartenders -Very good beer selection.  All the basics, a few local brews -Menu was typical \"pub food\" but they had a VERY wide range of selection of sauces for their wings to the point they compete with the likes of Buffalo Wild Wings in that regard.  I ordered the cheesy jalapeno at the suggestion of the bartender, and they didn't disappoint.  Their house made chips were also really good  I'll definitely go back when I'm in town.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I stopped at Redbeards during Light Up Night.  At first glance, drink prices are high.  $5 Sam Adams was the special.  My girlfriend ordered a half rack of ribs and I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken.  When I received my chicken and cut into it, I was able to pull the breading off the entire chicken.  I took my first bite and the chicken was rubber.  My dinner came with baked beans and cole slaw.  The baked beans were as if they had been sitting there cooking all day.  Beyond dry, and well past the point of being sold to anyone.    My girlfriends ribs were burnt, and the ones that weren't burnt had a fat cap that had not been properly cooked away so they were very chewy.  She had 2 ribs and a few french fries.  I ate two bites of cole slaw and a bite of my chicken and beans.  We notified the bartender that the food was not good at all and we would just like it taken off the bill, as we would just go somewhere else to eat.  The bartender called the manager and told him the situation.  The bartender came back over and said that they took 50% off of the bill.  I had a beer, my girlfriend had a glass of wine, I had a bite of chicken, and she had 2 ribs - our remaining bill was $32.  I found another bartender and had them bring the manager over.  The manager told me that he took care of our bill by taking half of it off since we \"ate half of the food, and that the ribs were fall off the bone tender, and my chicken was properly cooked.\"  I again told him the chicken was not properly cooked, it had a horrible consistency, and my girlfriends ribs were either burnt or encased in chewy fat, and I wasn't paying for any of the food but would pay for our drinks.\"  The manager took the food off our check, we paid for our drinks and left.  I won't be back with some of the other better options around Redbeards.",

Then, the hostess comes by placing a sign \"please see hostess for availability\".  Ok, I guess we were too close to the table for the waitresses liking!! She could have said \"Hello!  If you all need another drink, I can take care of you!\" But no, a quick admonishment and the \"sign\"!  Needless to say, we did not want to stand right in the middle of the traffic flow so we left.

Upon leaving reserved tables STILL weren't taken (1.5 hours passed).  Someone should be supervising the seating a little better if they want to make more money and serve more customers. Dinners took forever and tables sat well after us were served before us (same meals).  Food mediocre.  Friends fries were ice cold.  Hubby had potatoes with his dinner and the portion was disgraceful (should've taken a photo - was the joke of the night). Drinks were served all to wrong people and each person was asked as they were served what they ordered - we fixed it after tasting each beer (bad mistakes for server for guests to straighten out the orders). Good thing we can taste the difference between an IPA and a sour beer!   Not worth the money to stop here for a mediocre meal and be served a beer that isn't correct - unless you want everyone in your party to sip it and tell which beer goes with which person.   Good thing we are all good friends but overall service and food just is unacceptable.  Also they cannot provide enough menus for food and beer to tables without waiting for other tables to finish using them.  Again good thing we were friends and could share menus upon finishing using them. For an establishment to not have an adequate amount of menus when they are not full and busy is strange.   Seems like a simple investment when you have paper beer menus and could invest in a few more food menus.  Just a thought if you're selling food and beer.  Hate to leave bad reviews but give credit where it's due.  This place could use some improvements for service and basic needs for customers.",

They have an upstairs and a downstairs bar and some tables on both levels too.  The hostess suggested we try upstairs as it wasn't as busy.  And it wasn't so we easily got a seat.    The place is nice, I can't complain about the decor.  They also had many beers on draft including crafts, and like a broken record I ordered me a Southern Tier IPA... It was glorious.  We looked over the menu for a while and I decided on a Ball Park Burger, cooked pink added jalapenos to it, and the vegetable of the day for the side.  The H got a flat bread they made special as a BBQ chicken one.  The bartender seemed really nice, and pretty attentive.    As we waited for our food to come the upstairs started to get busier and busier, which also includes louder and drunker.  I can't exactly blame the bar for this but I absolutely can't stand someone putting their hand on the back of my chair, putting their foot on the foot rest and squeezing in every five minutes to order 5 crazy shots for him and his drunk friends!  So there was that.  How fun is it to eat with a stranger leaning on you????  Yea it ain't.    So some more time passes and someone from the kitchen comes out to tell me they don't have any more vegetables.  Ok so I got the slaw, no biggy, so about 5 minutes later our food comes out.  The burger tasted good but alas they forgot the bacon on the burger! I am now kind of fighting to get the bartenders attention due to the spike in the rowdy, young, drunk crowd.  I asked nicely, \"Isn't this supposed to have bacon on it?\"  She rolled her eyes and said \"yea let me guess they forgot?\"  ding, ding, ding, and the winner goes to... Yea so anyhow she brings the bacon and I only ate  1/2 because I am trying to eat smaller portions, you know swimsuit season is right around the corner...  Well it was a good thing I only ate  1/2 cause my H was still really hungry.  The flatbread was small not a great size, and I usually get flatbread envy when he orders them, but not this time.  We were getting ready to leave and got our check.  I was a little upset they charged $.75 for me to add jalapenos when they almost stiffed me on bacon, and didn't have the side I ordered and didn't know it until 15 minutes after I ordered.  We scooped ourselves up and left.  Summary, food was ok, nothing spectacular.  Cool bar, nice bartender, but I am over being sandwich in my stool by a bunch of hammered college students... Though I'm not too old to recall how many moons ago, I was but one of them...",

Redbeards was busy on a Friday evening around 5:30, but they had tables available (they have two spaces, upstairs and downstairs). They call themselves a sports bar, and there certainly are some TVs, but the music was turned up SO LOUD that it made the place feel almost club-like.   Anyway, from 4-6 on Mondays through Fridays they have happy hour specials, so we were able to catch the tail end of those... $2.00 off appetizers, as well as drink specials. The menu is mostly pretty standard bar fare. We ordered 3 appetizers (pretzel sticks, mozzarella logs, and pierogies), as well as a half dozen wings. Well, let me clarify...we attempted to order a half dozen wings. The music was so loud that it was hard to converse with the waitress (and ourselves, frankly), so she must've thought we just said a \"dozen\" wings, because that's what we were brought. Similarly, we tried to order queso sauce with our pretzel sticks, but I don't think she heard that either, because the dip accompanying the pretzels was definitely not queso.   The food was solid bar food. The mozzarella logs were big rectangular hunks of fried cheese with a tasty marinara dipping sauce...who can't get on board with that? Frankly, I might eat all of my food in log shapes from now on. The pretzel sticks were soft and warm with just the right amount of salt. My biggest complaint about those is that I didn't care for the dipping sauce that accompanied them. I have no idea what it was, but it definitely wasn't the queso we ordered. Maybe a mustard of some kind? It had a really strong fake smoke flavor that I hated, although my hubby thought it was super tasty, so different strokes, I guess. The pierogies were also respectable. Not the best I've ever had by a long shot, but they were seasoned well and had plenty of fluffy potato and cheddar filling. I would've liked them to be a little more buttery and served with onions, but they were pretty tasty as is. Lastly, the honey mustard wings were quite delicious. They were perfectly fried, very meaty, and the sauce was sweet and tangy.   Overall, we were satisfied with our food, especially since everything (except the wings) was $2 off because of the happy hour. If we had paid full price, however, I'd probably be less pleased, because the regular prices here are very expensive (both food and drinks). You're definitely paying a premium for the location. Note that if you check in on Yelp (at least as of the time of this review), you'll receive 10% off of your bill, but it's not valid on already-discounted food (i.e. happy hour) or any alcohol. Service was very prompt and efficient.  I'll probably return when I'm in the area during happy hour....I just hope next time they'll turn down their damn music! (Why yes, I do have a collection of children's frisbees that have landed in my yard, why do you ask?) :)",

My first batch of wings where served cold with an improperly made \"Giddy Up\" sauce which is a flavor I have all the time.... The server kindly apologized and took the wings away. A few moments later we were handed back the same batch of wings that obviously had been microwaved do to how soggy the wings had become. (Still with that mystery white sauce). I bit into the wing and even with the microwaving, the wing was bloody and raw on the inside.   The manager came over once and offered to get us something else. After the initial lack of effort put into our initial meal, I declined as did my friend who was also uncomfortable with the kitchen.   I won't be back to this Red Beards. I will still however frequent the Mt Washington location where the kitchen cares about what comes out to the customer.    (This was not the first bad experience at this location, but it will now be the last.)",

As someone who makes pierogies from scratch paying homage to my heritage, to say I was disappointed is an understatement.  I understand taking some short cuts here and there but I have a hard time believing in a city known for pierogies that some better local options aren't available.    Other than that, the service was fine, we had a larger group and our waiter kept up pretty well and was very friendly.  Drinks and the rest of our food was okay but nothing to write home about.

I was surprised when we were seating immediately and there wasn't many people eating (also worried..why is nobody eating?).  The place is smaller than i expected, but there is another bar and seating upstairs which we didn't know about.  Our waitress was quick and very nice.  Food was typical bar style food, burgers, fries, wraps, salads, etc.  Prices seemed fair.  I got a Yuengling bottle for 3.75 and a turkey wrap for around $10.  Their weekly specials were impressive (AYCE Crab legs on monday ~$27, AYCE wings on Wed ~$10, $1 tacos on Tuesday).  My only gripe is the cost my fiance's Moscow Mule..$12 bucks!  This isn't an upscale place, idk what they're thinking charging that much.  They're lucky I didn't catch the price before she ordered it.  Overall, food was good and arrived quick.  Service was very good and our meal was less than 50 even with the stupid ass 12$ moscow mule so that was a plus.  I'll be back soon and try out the AYCE wings.",

While there was no official kids menu, there were quite a few kid-friendly options already on the menu (I.e chicken tenders, grilled cheese, burgers & fries, etc.).  Redbeards is set up with a bar on the 1st & 2nd floors...and tables surrounding.  While I'm sure it wouldn't be appropriate to bring kids there after dinner hours, the staff made us feel completely welcome bringing our kids in for dinner before the hockey game.   Ordered some pretty basic lunch-type food (taco salad, flatbread sandwich, pretzel & chicken tender app, and a cheese-only hoagie).  The service was outstanding, and they were beyond friendly and welcoming.   The only catch was...when our bill came, that cheese-only hoagie they were so nice to make for one of our kids...they charged us $10 for that!  In fact...we only ordered soft drinks (no alcohol), and the items mentioned above...and our bill was $60! I guess that's the going rate for these downtown places...but for  lunch-type items...this still seemed a little steep. Aside from that...the food was great, the service outstanding, and it had a relaxed atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend...just be prepared...it's not an inexpensive place.",

Not only do they serve food until 1AM, but they also serve their entire menu.   I ordered the quesadillas, which were exceptionally tasty. I like how they put olives and jalapenos in them. I did not have to wait too long for them, and the bartender was nice and pleasant. Overall, I believe that this restaurant and sports bar is a solid staple in the downtown community.",

I thought we couldn't go wrong with a restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh because most everything we had was so good. Well this place was so bad.   The only reason they get two stars is because they were friendly and it was clean. But that's as far as the \"good\" goes.   We ordered some pretty basic stuff, and it took quite a long time to receive even though they were not busy.   Taco salad - chicken was very dry and tasteless, the rest was just boring  Soup of the day - this was described as tomato soup with meatballs, \"like Italian wedding soup but with a red sauce\". All four of us are willing to bet money it was a can of spaghetti-Os!  French onion soup - also tasted canned  I rarely give bad reviews. But I would have liked to have known myself how bad this was. And the kicker is, it was expensive. Sigh  Live and learn",

Close to the size of a quarter.  Spoke to manager and mentioned that almost half of the order was the size on the plate.  Her response was that she too had small chicken wings earlier that day.  She casually said she would see what she could do.  Never saw her again and nothing was done.  Very disappointing customer relations.  Could have changed my experience, but instead the manager made it worse.  Waiter was great.  Manger was horrible and should get some training possibly in conflict resolution.",

There were no spaces, but we were happy to learn that there was another bar upstairs with ample standing room. I ordered our drinks, which were okay-mixed cocktails but was pretty astounded when I got the bill. 21 bucks for 2 mixed drinks. A little much for a sports bar, no? However, Redbeard's downtown seems to have upped its game from its Mt. Washington location. It is definitely a bit more trendy feeling, which was fine, but that comes with a price tag. The bars have a ton of big screen TVs, which made it very fun and easy to watch multiple games at once.  We finally got seated and ordered our meals. They were very careful about my food allergies, which was great. The manager came over multiple times to make sure our meals were to our liking and allergen free. Wonderful customer service!  The food was pretty damn good. I got a bowl of the chili, which is homemade (and free of top 8 allergens!) and the steak salad. They fry in soybean oil, so avoid that if you have the allergy. My husband got dry-rubbed cajun wings and loved them. Our bill was reasonable for the food, so that was a plus. Just be wary of the high drink prices!",

We ordered the salmon croquettes and pretzel sticks for appetizers. The salmon croquettes were dry and were really lacking in flavor, so I could only eat it after spreading the queso sauce on top that we got with our pretzel sticks to make them more bearable. That was the first croquette. The second one tasted weird, like a chicken nugget. The pretzel sticks were warm and the queso dip was a good choice to go along with it. I wish they didn't have as much salt on them though. I ordered the Early Tee Time burger, which comes topped with a fried egg, crispy bacon, American cheese, and mayo and a side of steak fries. It was a pretty average burger; I've had much better burgers with egg and bacon. Friends ordered the fish & chips and the garden salad and both more or less enjoyed them.

    "text": "Eh, I wasn't particularly impressed with my time at Redbeard's.  The good: On Wednesdays all day, they have all you can eat wings and chips for $10. Great deal considering 10 wings off of their menu are $10 themselves. You can only choose one flavor at a time. You start off with ten and then receive them by 5's. For my first batch, I tried the honey bbq which was good (i love honey bbq) The second batch, I ordered the Redbeard's Signature sauce- sweet chili sauce, BBQ sauce & some hot sauce. I really enjoyed that sauce. Their chips are nice too and are seasoned with a litte kick of something.. can't put my finger on it.  The Average: Everything else. Our service really wasn't too good. She seemed to be new and we waited awhile to put in our order. In her defense, I do believe she was new  because she pulled out a list whenever we asked her what the craft beer options were. For drinks, we started off with a long island each.. terrible! Too much Sours were in that drink which literally can ruin the drink.. and it did. Also, at the end of the night we found out that each long island was $12. wtf?! $24 on 2 crappy drinks? We gulped the drink to get it over with then ordered 2 vodka and orange juice.. aka a tall glass of OJ and a splash of vodka. So in conclusion on drinks.. We spent $20 each on drinks  ($40 total) and didnt even walk out of there with a buzz. -_- Also, Bobby ordered the stuffed mushrooms with crab (appetizer) to eat. It was completely bland and both the mushroom and crab were not seasoned. It would've been completely delicious with a nicely seasoned mushroom and a tad of old bay on the crab.  The menu seemed large and had nice selections.. pub food plus some entrees. If we do stop back it will be for all you can eat wings.. and we will stop there. Totally disappointed with both the food & drinks for what the final bill ended up being :(",

    "text": "Tried Redbeards today for the first time. The place was pretty busy but I was able find a seat at the bar. The bartender seemed friendly and energetic when he greater me. I was happy to learn that they serve raspberry ice tea and decided on the Ballpark Burger with a side salad after reviewing the menu.   While waiting for my burger I took in the atmosphere. Six TVs lined the walls behind the bar; all on mute playing sports stations or TNT. The walls adorn Pittsburgh sports art. Contrasting that was the dim, almost too dim, lighting. It's hard to tell whether they're going for a sports bar or contemporary romantic feel. Of course I notice how well stocked the bar was and what a nice selection of craft beers that they have on tap.   Oddly enough, my burger came out before the salad. No real issue for me but I think it does reflect a small hiccup in the kitchen. This was easily forgiven though by the quality of burger that was served. It was dense and juicy without making the bun all soggy. The bacon on it was thick and chewy, not that cheap, thin stuff that some places try pass off to cut cost with. The burger was topped with provolone cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato and pickle. Well worth the $11.00 they charge for it.   The salad that I had afterwards was mostly lettuce with two slices of cucumber, two slices of onion, two cherry tomatoes and two pepperoncini's. In the corner of the dish there was some sliced up black olives... I had to wonder that if you were to put the slices of olives back together, would they combine to make of two whole olives? The southwest dressing that I got with it had a nice zest to it and everything on the salad was super fresh.  Despite some of its idiosyncrasies, Redbeards gets a big thumbs up from me. I felt I got a good value for the meal that I enjoyed and I wouldn't hesitate to suggesting it as a meeting place for the next ball game or show that I go to in the Cultural District.",

We got there around noon and proceeded up the steps as the downstairs was full, there was no one at the podium to greet us, and no signage saying to see the hostess. On the second level we were greeted by a clearly flustered server telling us to see the hostess downstairs to be seated. So we went back down the steps. The hostess then took us upstairs to seat us. Okay, fine, I burned a few calories. When we got back upstairs the hostess tried to sit us and the same flustered server stopped her, said some inaudible things about another sever, yada yada yada, so we get led to a different table (maybe in a different servers section but at any rate this should have been seamless to us, the customer).   After about 5 minutes a nice young lady comes and takes our drink order. This is about 12:05 at this point. She comes back about 12:10 and delivered said drinks and takes our order. Great! We are on par to make it to the game by 1. She stops back over about 12:20 and delivers small plates, says it should not be much longer. 12:30 she won't make eye contact. 12:40 she breezes past our table and ignores us calling to her. 12:50 and still no food. Now we ordered nachos, fried zucchini, and a chicken wrap. There is no WAY it should have taken 40 minutes to make this food. There were empty tables all around us. Since our server would not acknowledge us and we waited 40 minutes and still did not have food we got up and walked out.   Not to mention it was SO LOUD!!! They had the sound for the TV blaring and I had to yell at someone sitting a foot from me.   Super disappointing and not going back.",

The deep fried pickles have the perfect amount of breading on them. The chicken quesadillas were packed full with chicken and veggies. I'd say the buffalo chicken pitas were the best! The pulled pork nachos were good, but nothing special. Kyle was our waiter and provided excellent service. I would definitely come back again!",

I'm usually weary about ordering grilled cheese anywhere since you can make so cheap at home but the waiter suggested it. Stuffed with cheese, bacon, tomato, then burnt cheese wrapped around the bread. It was large portion and could only eat half. Definitely a must order. Leftovers were just as good. Waiter was friendly and helpful",

Maybe it was because we had rival baseball team stuff on and he didn't think we would be repeat customers? However, treat all customers right and let the great reviews pour in ultimately helping your business grow. Don't treat customers right and watch the negative reviews kill your business. My guess is the manager doesn't own the place either so no problem for him if it doesn't do as well as it could.",

I got them plain, but asked for three sauces on the side: redbeard's signature sauce, jalapeno and cheese sauce, and a Horsey sauce that was the surprisingly best sauce.  Our server Cindy was perfect. She recommended the Horsey sauce and although I was skeptical about it at first, I was glad to have tried it.   I also got an order of the nachos (pulled pork). While decent, the chips were salty AF.   There is no question that I will return for more wings next time I need to eat downtown.",

We were immediately seated and brought waters. Since it was our first time in we asked for a burger and wing recommendation. I appreciated the waiters forthrightness in steering us toward tried and True favorites.   We ended up splitting the Mountain Climber burger and a 6-count of Cajun Ranch traditional wings. (Because it was a dry rub we were very grateful we got traditional).   The burger was well cooked, the fries were well seasoned and our only complaint was that the onion straws tasted as though they'd been sitting out a while and had gotten a little too soft.   Wings were quite good and tasted a bit like Cool Ranch Doritos. Wish it wasn't an extra buck for Ranch drip, but just a heads up.   Reasonable price, good portions, clean environment.",

    "text": "Certainly not blown away by the food or service at Redbeard's. The company I work for had a gathering down here on a Wednesday, the wing night. My coworker was telling us how good their wings are, great flavors, fried nice and crispy, the whole nine yards. He went on to tell us that they have all you can eat for $12.99. Can't beat that we figured.  My coworker called the morning of to set up reservations for a party of 15. By the time we all start to show up, we get there and nothing was ready to go. The waitress had to move tables around, move chairs, just so that we would be able to sit down. I was under the impression that this was why folks call ahead and make reservations, so that things can be in order when a large party arrives. Not a huge deal, but things get more interesting.  The wings were decent. I was happy with the amount of flavors and and original recipes that they had, but that was about it. Our server was not very interested at all in providing good service to us. I know it's all you can eat wings and that requires a lot of back and forth, but if you're going to run a promotion be ready to handle the business. When it was time to get checks and leave, we asked our waitress 3x if we could have a take home box. Unreal. I know when you go to some places and you have a party of 8 or more, they add in gratuity. Not sure if that was the reason we received subpar service or what, but either way. Redbeard's seems more like that kind of bar that you stumble into just because you're nearby and want a drink or food. Nothing too spectacular here.",

Restaurant is always clean the multiple times we've been there both before and after shows and games. Only thing that I find annoying is that the manager (?) always wants to seat you upstairs. I get that they probably want it to look empty so people come in, but give people the option -don't just say \"is upstairs okay\" when there's multiple empty tables you're standing 5 feet from.  Will continue to go back, and continue to sit on the main floor if I see open tables.",

    "text": "A couple weeks ago, my boyfriend's coworkers decided to meet up after work for wings at Redbeard's on Sixth. I get off work a little later than he does, so when my day's duty was done I went to meet him down there. The Wednesday wing special is all you can eat wings for $12.99, which is a great deal!   There is seating both upstairs and downstairs, but tonight we were seated upstairs since we had a large group of around 12 people or so. I sat down with the group and everyone seemed pretty pleased with their wings so far, and a couple people were still patiently waiting on the waitress to return with theirs. You can put in an initial order for 10 wings, and then following that you get your wings 5 per order.   It wasn't a horribly long wait before the waitress came around, but it really wasn't busy to the point that you'd think you'd be waiting as long as we did before being checked on. I ordered a quesadilla, my boyfriend and some people ordered more wings, and some people ordered some drinks, too. The wait for our food wasn't bad, but the waitress didn't bring any napkins, so everyone around the table had wing fingers until she returned with them. There was one woman in particular that didn't receive her wings after several of the waitress' trips back and forth, and the waitress had eventually said she forgot to put in the order and apologized. What was really strange, though, was that the old fashioned that the man sitting across from me ordered was BRIGHT RED. An old fashioned should never look like this, and I can only imagine what it tasted like compared to the real deal. Although it was definitely made wrong, it gave us some good joke material for the rest of the night.  All in all, $12.99 for all you can eat wings is a good deal. My quesadilla was good, but nothing to really write home about. It was strange that it had olives in it, but aside from that it was good. I can't say that Redbeard's is on the top of my list for places I'd love to come back to, but for a large group it isn't a bad choice.",

    "text": "Probably the best bar we went to on our trip to Pittsburgh. Why? Hospitality, great food and more!  To be honest, we went here on three separate occasions, on the same night! The first visit was our first time ever coming in here. It was very empty so that meant we were going to get up close and personal with the staff. We sat down at the bar and the bartender was very friendly. She ran through what they specialize in and asked what kinds of things we liked and where we were from. Which led to her hassling us about our favorite hockey team, the Red Wings, as opposed to the Penguins. But oh well :). We stayed for about an hour and then cashed out and were going to move on, but then it started raining heavily.  We turned around and sat back down in the same seats and she welcomed us back and we started over again. This time, however, she suggested some food. This food was not just an appetizer, it was the BEST BBQ wings we had ever had. Anywhere. She explained that they were trying out the idea of this and the sauces. If this business hasn't decided yet, KEEP YOUR WINGS PLEASE! They were amazing.  Since we were visiting, we needed to sadly part ways. The bartender begged us to stay, but we sadly said farewell, maybe to meet again. We headed back to Market Square and continued the night. Since it was a Sunday, everything was closing early. But not Redbeard's...  We came back for round three. We each got wings again and some more drinks. She was so happy to see us return! Even the owner/manager(?) recognized us and greeted us back to our spots again.  This bar, to us, was a taste of Pittsburgh and how friendly Pittsburgh is. This place will always stick out in our mind and will help bring us to Pittsburgh. Those wings are a Bucket List item, definitely.",

    "text": "This review is about drinks ONLY.  We did not get their food.  When my fiance and I were visiting Pittsburgh recently, we ended up at Redbeard's on Sixth so we could try out their happy hour before we had dinner at nearby Tako.  The outside has a bit of a divey appearance.  We were pleasantly surprised by the inside.  The bar was really nice and they had a lot of seating and multiple floors.    They had a really nice drink selection and a lot of tvs  that were showing sports.  It's a perfect place to catch a game.  My only complaint with this spot is that the service was painfully slow at times.  Also, we tried to close out but the waitress completely misunderstood us and brought us another round, instead.  We just rolled with it but it took a really long time to get our checks and I ended up having to leave by myself in order to make it to our dinner reservation while my fiance stayed behind to handle the check.    I am hoping the bad service was a one-time thing but the three stars this place has leads me to believe that I might be wrong.  Hopefully they can get that aspect sorted out because otherwise, it is a great place.",

We were seated quickly, and when I explained to the server we had a concert to stt st nd in about an hour, he quickly took our drink and meal orders. The lad decided on the blackened salmon over rice with green beans, and I went with their hot pepper plate. Great selections both. The boy really enjoyed his seasoned spicey dish, even insisting I try a bite. Wow - terrific! My peppers were hot and great, served with some delicious tomato pasta twists and garlic toast. It was all out in z jiff, but with nice presentation...and delicious all! A quick and very reasonable bill (gee...that's all?) and we were at the hall for some excellent Beethoven with time to spare. Well done...great service, great food, and at a reasonable price. It helped make for a great evening!",

It was no wait and food came out fast for a group of 8. One coworkers was a vegetarian and they were able to accommodate. It was fairly quiet inside during lunch. Could've been that many people took off from work that day. That made it easy to hear and quicker service. I enjoyed a bacon turkey wrap with fries. The portion of fries was on the smaller side but still seasoned well and tasted good.  Overall very good- basically what I'd expect from a burger place with god service and i had no complaints at all.",

They said the upstairs was closed... But then asked if we wanted to go up there? We got upstairs and we were the only people in the room. We went at 3 to watch the game and it wasn't on one of the tvs with sound! They were watching ice skating. IT WAS THE LAST TWO GAMES BEFORE THE SUPERBOWL! We went there because it was supposed to be a sports grill. Once situated, we realized the vent above our table was blowing freezing cold air. We asked the bartender at least 3 times to please fix it. The waitress was horrible. Very poor service! Couldn't believe how long it took her to serve us when we were the only people in the restaurant. She brought us waters and then came back and asked if we needed waters? Literally within 10 minutes.  Two of us didn't even drink our waters yet. Our alcoholic drinks took forever. The food was cold and not worth it at all. We had more people join us and we barely saw a waitress. When she did come over she would walk past the table and not say a word.  WE NEVER EVEN RECEIVED HER NAME! She never once smiled. We complained to the manager and he told us they never realized they would be so busy? But for the first three hours, there was only us and two other tables? Her service was poor the entire time. We finally decided to leave... Our waitress put totally wrong drinks on our bill. Then we walked outside and were FOLLOWED BY THE MANAGER AND SERVER. YELLING AT US THAT WE DIDNT PAY ONE OF OUR BILLS! Totally embaressing. We all paid our bills and would never leave without paying. No matter how bad it was. The guy we were with, went to the bar to pay his bill. When they walked back into the restaurant to confirm that he paid the bartender said she never swiped his card!!! Like what the hell? Why would you take someones card.... Hand it back and never do the transaction? We will NEVER go here again. Totally ridiculous. Don't waste your money.",

Odd scene: they had sound on for Pirates game, then, as Bucs were two batters from closing out the game, they start blasting music? After Pirates game ends (as does the one song), they put sound back on for Pens game. Inexplicably, in last two minutes of that game, they again start blasting music? Weird.

They came out cold, gave him two small slices of pepper, and barely a chicken breast.  He asked to talk to the manager and she gave him ridiculous attitude for complaining ( he never complains at restaurants) and was unapologetic.  We decided to give it another try.  For the Pirate home opener they said the \"special\" was a $5 Miller lite draft with a pirate cup.  We were still charged $5 for the special despite the restaurant not having the Pirate cup.  We asked about it (our waiter didn't even tell us) and he said \"it's been 2 months and they haven't come in yet\".  We then got our bill and were charged full price.  I would think again when going to this bar.  They have high prices for less than quality food and they have False advertising on their so-called \"drink specials\".",

Tonight the Patriots are playing so I wanted a venue that would offer a healthy fare and televisions to watch the game. Red Beards offers this! I started with the chips, salsa and queso appetizer. The chips had the right amount of salt. The queso was a unique flavor and I really enjoyed  it! The salsa was more like a pico and was very fresh. I ordered the beef taco salad and was extremely pleased. The dressing was spicy on the tongue but flavorful. The presentation was very colorful and appealing.I picked off the jalapenos because I am not able to stomach those but they made it look really pretty. I ordered a cocktail from the menu which has pineapple juice and rum. It made me feel like I was in the Caribbean as I watched the patriots play. The person next to me ordered the French onion soup who said it was good. There were plenty of onions and broth. They also ordered the steak hoagie and they devoured it! It was full of meat but not a messy sandwich. Megan W. was my waitress and she was timely, efficient and very sweet. She met every request without hesitation or delay. The establishment is clean and comfortable. If I return to Pittsburgh I will definitely come back here! I recommend this place!",

    "text": "Redbeard's has long been a place which I frequent. Since moving to Pittsburgh in 2007 I've been coming here (not sure why so many out of town people think its new, its far from new). They have a pretty good selection of beer. I wouldn't say they are a craft beer emporium or anything like that, but at least they value brews other than Coors Light and Bud Light.  Their menu has a pretty good variety of items on it. They do some more restaurant/dinner type entrees throughout the week as well. I would not say their wings are the best in da 'Burgh, but they are pretty good.  They recently revamped their menu and increased their prices(having worked in the restaurant industry for many years I understand the need to do this), but it seems they took off some our favorite items. For that I have to give it 4 stars.  They have a great outdoor seating area which is open almost year round. Others have complained about the loud music. I would agree. The music can be loud, but its  a bar folks!! If you want to watch the Pens, Steelers or Pirates play, you certainly can. Sit in the bar area and the volume is usually pretty loud.  They have a nice dining room for a bar too. You can request to sit in the far back room if its a more quite atmosphere in which you seek.  I recommend the chicken quesodilla or a burger. Just watch out, its build your own burger and they charge for each topping, but please, don't bark about the price. We all know you can make a burger at home for a buck or two(its one of the best money makers for a restaurant).",

My friends and I were looking for a place to relax and watch the baseball game and when we asked the server if the TV could be changed we were told we have to wait for the hockey game to be over. Even though there were 5 tv's showing the game with no one watching it. Sure no problem, then we asked another server what kinda of wheat beers they had on tap not only did she have no idea but she also did not know the prices to what she was offering. The menu did not have beers prices hence the reason why we had to ask. Then proceeded to stand around and gossip with the other girls, while the bartender threw ice cubes at the waitresses. I gave this restaurant 2 stars for their employees lack of knowledge before putting them on the floor, and not being very attentive.",

Yuenglings were flowing. Water was constantly refilled.  The manager obliged to make sure the game was turned on in time and stopped by to make sure our needs were met.

Two words on the menu indicated to me we had made the right decision: Italian Quesadilla, which was as good and interesting as it sounds. Wife had a hamburger and fries, and combined with our drinks, found that we really didn't need to eat for the rest of the day, yet at the same time the meal didn't exhaust us.",

I started with several $4 Captain and Diet Cokes, so my evening was grrrreat.  But I also enjoyed our spring roll appetizer and my grilled chicken breast w/jalapeno & cheese wing sauce.  The sweet potato waffle fries rounded out a delightful bar meal and our service was overall good.  Keep Redbeard's in mind for a group meal. The upstairs is spacious and has a good vibe. AND they take reservations, which is a welcome change from the many downtown establishments which do not. What's up with that, btw?",

    "text": "Save your time - it's precious. Even though the place was empty enough to be seated immediately, it took over 45 minutes to get 2 dishes, and then 1 of them was wrong. Another 30 minutes later, the chicken wrap was finally done properly.  I guess they had to pluck and butcher a fresh bird.The server never even took our drink order.   A manager gave us a paltry $3 off the check for this huge inconvenience.    I emailed 5 days ago and have yet to hear anything from the management. Redbeards clearly does not value customers or want repeat business.",

I felt like I've know them forever.   They made me laugh and were super attentive.  This bar is so nice to go to to just have a relaxing conversation.  I will come to this place time and time again.   If I could give it more stars I would.",

    "text": "The. Downtown location has a great bar and atmosphere.   The food was good a very filling grilled chicken sandwhich and some awesome sweet potato fries.  The bartender was very personable. Never lacked in service and offered to put a game on which was hard to see at the end if the bar.   He's a keeper!     I would have stayed and drank for quite a while if it wasn't for having to listen to a waitress stand at the end of the bar, cuss like a sailor, and complain about her job the entire time!  Made me feel like I was having dinner on the Jerry springer show set.",
