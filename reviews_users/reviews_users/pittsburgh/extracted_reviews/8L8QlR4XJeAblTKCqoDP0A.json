I bought three tacos and could only stomach eating 2 of them. This is not even close to a Mexican Street Style Taco Stand. They need to go to Edgar's Taco Shack and learn what a traditional taco stand is. I gave them two stars out of kindness. Editing the review to reflect a one star now since the owner decided to message me to edit my review. They use GFS frozen pulled pork and beef in their tacos. We literally saw the packages in the window.",

Now lets talk about the food, Ive had everything there the spicy beef the chicken the pork all super good and worth every penny. The loaded nachos will fill you up for days, they hook you up. Now for the customer service the two girls that work the morning shift not sure what there names are but its the blond and the brunette there probally in there 30's id say. But there love and passion for there job definately shows they are always smiling and treat you like you belong there not to mention how much the care and attention to detail of the product they serve. Those two alone are worth the trip but I can guarentee once you eat there youll be a repeat customer. Best Tacos In Pittsburgh And Customer Service. Hands Down.",

    "text": "To begin with I totally understand the reviews being all over the map in that some are four stars and others are one star.   I feel that, depending on the day, a person's mood, the quality, the size of Bull River's tacos, the price point, the location, and set up could easily sway anybody one way or the other.  This place is polarizing.  It is hard to categorize this taco stand because Bull River is brand new to the location and trying to develop its own identity, break into the South Hills market, and provide a decent product within a set price point while making financial ends meet.  I've been there three times and can tell that they have a LOT of potential but they are definitely learning and taking their lumps.  Here is my candid review: The positives:  I found the taco stand to be set up really well given its extremely small space, I think their meat (and overall food) is definitely better than average in quality and they use fresh ingredients for the most part (which is absolutely key), they aren't pretending to be something they are not - they aren't authentic Mexican - they appear to be a SW American taco stand, their meat was fresh, juicy and well made in a pressure cooker,  their price point is in line with other taco stands in Pittsburgh, their employees are attentive, friendly, the stand is clearly very clean inside, they have solid flavors in their carnitas, very tasty taco toppings, complimentary sides, fantastic decorations and quick service.  The negatives:  No bathrooms (they aren't required because they do not have a seating area exactly like Las Palmas in Brookline), their tacos are not as big as their nearest competitors (though the quality of meat is better), the taste of the chicken isn't as flavorful as other stands (they need to kick up the spice in their chicken),  their guacamole is definitely NOT homemade, the stand is so small I watched as an employee used the floor to prepare chicken in a pressure cooker - he did a good job with it but he had to sit the cooker on the floor in front of customers,  they aren't using traditional, high quality Mexican corn tortillas (which I much prefer), they don't have a condiment bar (the taco toppings are already predetermined), they had some weird sauce they called \"bullseye\" sauce (they should dump it and go with something cleaner with less mayo and more spice - that'd be my first suggestion), they used prepackaged bagged tortilla chips, they could increase the size of their sides to meet the size of their nachos (which were not really that good), they need to empty their exterior garbage cans more often.  All in all, I found this place to be a good upstart southwestern taco stand.  They don't pretend to be something they aren't which wins HUGE points with me.  They are competing but need to make some significant changes to keep up with their competition. If they do so they will make it because their location is really fantastic.  I think 3 stars is spot on for now ... we will see how/if they progress or regress.    Recommendation:  I will 100% go back but I realize YMMV.",

The food was not good the service was even worse. Nobody wore gloves the garbage cans were full and all of the employees that were there or very unfriendly. I reluctantly stopped a few days ago when a friend insisted that we ate there. I was so surprised with the service the food was a hundred percent better. Everything was clean the people personable the garbage cans were empty. The girls behind the counter were very friendly and accommodating. They took the time to explain what went on which tacos and had no problem altering ingredients to my personal preferences. All around I had total experience that I was so pleased with in the food was so good. I definitely would recommend this place.",

    "text": "Quite possibly the tastiest tacos I've ever had (and I eat a lot of Mexican food)! When I ordered and saw it was $3 for a small taco, I wasn't all that impressed... until I tasted them. WOW. Just, WOW. Each ingredient was unique, all the flavors stand out on their own but blend together so well. I went with the vegetarian tacos. The black beans were soft but still held their shape and were very flavorful. The farmers cheese was mild but held its own. The soft tortillas (they use two and gently heat them on the grill) are the best I've ever eaten. I'm not a bread kinda person but I left my visit craving more of those delicious soft tortillas! BY FAR, though, the BEST part is the Bullseye sauce. They need to just call it crack, it's honestly that addictive. On my second trip there I ordered the vegetarian salad with a side of Bullseye sauce as dressing. They were a bit heavy handed with the tortilla chips (ask for less chips if you aren't a fan), but generous with all the other toppings. Be sure to try the jalapenos, even if you don't like spicy food. They are pickled and are more sweet then spicy, a very pleasant surprise. Seriously, though, what they lack in volume they more than make up for in flavor. Run, don't walk, to Bull River Tacos.",

    "text": "Buyer Beware!!  Really wanted to like this quaint looking taco stand on the side of 51. As there are very few good options to eat in this area.  Ordered two tacos & the nachos.  When the nachos were opened they looked delicious!!  Unfortunately, the Canned Nacho Cheese & Beef were cold. Now being that this take-out only. I did eat my meal at the standing only tables outside, so time from kitchen to my belly may have been two minutes.  Also wifey & I order the a pork & chicken taco. The corn tortillas were not cooked, as they were crumbling in my hand. (First sign, corn tortillas aren't cooked). Also there was a very sparse amount of meat. I wish I took a picture to show everyone the tablespoon of chicken & pork on each taco.  Anyway, the reason I won't be back is the high schooler who was working the register.  I asked the kid after trying my nachos, \"is the nacho cheese suppose to be cold?\"  High schooler \"yes\"  Me, \"are you sure nacho cheese is suppose to be cold? Maybe you could warm some up for me?\"  High schooler \"it will take about 20 mins\"  Me,(getting irritated because wifey & I are starving) \"well can you refund me the money for the nachos, because they are kinda gross with cold nacho cheese\"   High schooler, \" I don't know how to do that since you paid with a card\"   Me, walked away in disgust with my cold nachos to never to return  PS this was around noon on a Sunday and both garbage were filled to the brim with trash, seems to be pretty odd considering they have only been open about an hour and fifteen minutes. Makes you wonder how often they empty their trash cans.   Gets an extra star for a good design",

Anyway, we were actually going to Spilly's, but they closed at 7pm and noticed the Bull River was still open. We had noticed it in the past when going to Spilly's. So we decided to give it a try, not to mention we were starving. We ordered 2 beef (brisket) and 2 chicken; we should have ordered only 1 of each. At first site theses tacos were loaded with so much meat. Imagine the filling of a chipotle burrito was all meat. Take 3/4 of that meat and add it to a taco. Totally unnecessary. We weren't even sure how to eat them. I ended up using a spoon to eat some of the meat before approaching it like any normal taco eating person. My boyfriend picked his up and soon realized it was a mistake and proceeded to walk and then stood in the parking lot with a trail of meat and toppings following him like a taco version of Hansel and Gretal. I'm not sure if this is to make up for lack luster ingredients and flavor. We went ahead and ate them there, considering how huge they were. The toppings were nothing to go to town about. The beef was dry and chewy; the chicken bland. Thank god for the hot sauces that provided much needed punch into flavortown. After living in Denver and DC, both of which have large populations of Latinos and people of Mexican heritage and having had my fair share of \"street\" tacos, this was truly disappointing. Why sooooo much meat...please take your time cooking the food and make fresh ingredients. You can't just slap food in a tortilla and call it tacos. Not sure we'll be back after one experience. *both my boyfriend and I woke up at 3 in the morning with stomachaches too. This was the only place/thing we at that evening.",

Also, she went out to pet a dog in someone's truck while I was waiting to order. It was not a health friendly atmosphere, more like half a$!  I was so impressed by the look of the place until I noticed there were flies flying around the meat and they left the lid open.  The girl also wore one glove to prepare the food and the other one went into the bathroom with her purse to smoke a cigarette.  F for professionalism.  Tacos anyone???",

Got the chicken and beef tacos and they were very flavorful with the different ingredients. The shells could've been cooked a little crispier. The outdoor seating is nice and relaxing and very casual. You can sit on the outside walls at the standing tables. However, with the amount of employees working, the garbage cans were overflowing and the tables could've been wiped clean after each customer. Overall great little place for quick yummy tacos! Will definitely be back!",

The food is pretty decent. I have tried every taco on their menu I believe. I really want this business to succeed and stay open for the long run! I like that their menu is small and simple. The customer service is good. It has been a tad slow for a taco stand but those times were when they just opened and are probably trying to get in the groove and figure things out still.",

While this restaurant was more hipster than authentic, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and portions.  My only complaints are that the hot sauce selection was lackluster, the salsa had a bit too much cumin flavor, and the staff did not know how to pronounce Jarrito. These negatives are forgivable, however.",

The only thing I could taste is lime. Second, the pork. Fine, but so much liquid. Sopping wet. Third, the spicy beef. Salt. Salt. Salt. Salt. I could barely eat it and I don't mind salt. The beef tasted like run of the mill taco seasoning. It was topped with jarred jalapenos. All of these tacos were topped with the same sort of crema.   I often judge Mexican food by taco and salsa, so I got chips, salsa, and quac. Chips were stale. The guacamole tasted like it had been squeezed out of a bag and the salsa as though it had come \"fresh\" out of a gallon jar.   So disappointing.   The upside? It isn't expensive. But neither is Taco Bell.",

I ordered the pork Taco, black beans, and then shared Loaded Nachos with the hubby.  The pork on the Taco was soft and juicy. They give you fresh lime to squeeze over your tacos. Since I am a No Heat Freak I chose the Cholula Cream over the Bulls Eye Sauce. It's like sour cream. The Taco also had guacamole, cilantro, pico de gallo and lime. It is encased in two corn tortillas.  The black beans are my favorite!! They are topped with pico, cholula cream, farmers cheese and lime. I will order these every time.   The nachos that I shared with the hubby were fresh tri colored nacho chips with ground beef, nacho cheese, pico, jalapenos, cholula cream, cilantro and lime. The chips stayed crispy which made them easier to eat. I squeezed some of my lime over the nachos and it was perfect for brightening them.  The hubby had the Spicy Beef Taco. It has pico, Bulkseye sauce, jalapenos, farmers cheese, cilantro, and lime. It was encased in a flour Taco shell. My hubby loved it.  For vegetarians they have a vegetarian Taco.  Something for everyone. There are no tables so I recommend BYOC-Bring Your Own Chair. Hang out and enjoy your food. You're going to love it.",

It is pretty basic set up but it has been maximized for what it is. The menu is pretty limited to tacos. Hence the name Bull River Tacos. They have a few tables to stand at if you want to eat there but I prefer to take the food with me. The tables will work good for someone that might be passing by or out on a quick lunch break. It's a perfect place for one of those nights that you want a quick and easy meal without the hassle or time to prep it. I think the price is fair for what you get. At the time of this review tacos are priced around $3.25. This price is very good for the quality of the product. Too many people are under the impression that all tacos should fall under fast food taco store prices. You are paying for quality ingredients here. The other day I bought 8 tacos and 2 loaded nachos for around $42. I was able to feed 3 adults and 5 young kids. The service is fast and the quality is always on. The staff is friendly and I have had a few conversations with owner while waiting for my order to be complete. The owner appreciates the patrons and always says thank you. More businesses should follow this model.",

My girls had the beef tacos and both loved them.  We also had the chips and salsa, which I would not rate that highly. The salsa tasted like it came from a jar, and the tacos were quit visibly from a bag. I yearn for some fresh salsa at the very least, but fresh salsa and freshly made chips would knock my review up. Still, a nice place to stop for a taco.",

I went with a chicken taco and the chicken salad, with bulls eye sauce on the side, in addition to the sour cream. For $3.25 a taco, and under $6 for a salad, this was a heck of a lot of food! My boyfriend ate the taco and really liked it. I LOVED my salad. Tasty chicken, lots of romane, pico, crushed up tortilla chips, and the bulls eye sauce was delicious on top. I really enjoyed my meal and am excited to go back!",

My husband and I are taco lovers but we were not impressed with Bull River Tacos. We ordered just about one of each and none of them stood out. The flavors of each were ok, but nothing out of this world. Rather lackluster to be honest.   We noticed that another location is opening in Squirrel Hill so we may give it another shot at the new location.",

The Pork that pico de gallo, bullsege sauce, farmers cheese and topped with fresh cilantro that was suppose to be on a corn tortilla but was on a flour tortilla.  A lime come with the taco.  The taco was good and the meat tasty but it probably had a little to much sauce making it very sloppy and taking away some the the taste of the meat.  The spicy beef taco comes on a flour tortilla with pico de gallo, bullsege sauce, jalapenos, farmers cheese and topped with fresh cilantro.  Enjoyed the taste but again probably a tad to much sauce.   We also ordered the loaded nachos to split and it is a meal in itself.",

It is right off Rt 51 with a covered area enclosed by railroad ties.  There is no place to eat so everything is to go. I tried a pork taco and a spicy beef taco. My favorite was the pork possibly because it is shredded while the beef is ground. The tortillas are also very good.  My drive time back to my house was about 20 minutes. The tacos were still hot and the tortillas still intact. At $3 each, this made for an inexpensive & delicious dinner.",

So be prepared to eat in your car. There is a reason they do not have seating- so please do not base your review off of that. The decor is so cute and I love the idea of the place.  The ingredients were good and fresh. They seemed high quality to me. My chicken taco was SO SPICY. I do wish I knew this beforehand. I literally couldn't finish the small taco because my mouth was on fire. The coleslaw on it was a really nice touch. I think $3 for a gourmet taco is a very fair price.   UPDATE: already came back and they changed their chicken! No longer super spicy!! I really appreciate a place that listens to their customers :) The vegetarian taco is also delicious! The beans are cooked perfectly.",

We tried the pork, chicken, spicy beef and an order of the black beans. The Spicy Beef Taco was delicous and had the right amount of spice, smothered in jalapenos. The Chiken Taco was kind of bland but thoroughly covered in the cholula sauce. The Pork Taco was tasty and the cabbage sprinkled on added a nice extra texture. I wouldn't order the black beans again, they were just ok.   4 tacos, a side of black beans and two Jarritos came to about $21. If I was really in the mood for a taco and in the area I would go again, but if I'm looking for authentic street tacos I'd go elsewhere.",

The counter worker was friendly and hospitable.  At first glance, the tacos were drenched in a cream sauce.  My first bite was disgusting.  The seasoning was so salty and overpowering.  I took a second bite just to make sure.  I was starving, but they went right into the trash.  The black beans were also very strange, and had an odd flavor.  The chips were cold and stale, nothing special.  Salsa was the least terrible thing, but very average and not fresh tasting at all.    Oh well, my search for a decent food spot in my childhood 'hood continues.  Restaurants like this make me happy to live in delicious Philly!",

Perfect amount of meat and seasoning/sauce. Great temperature also. The chicken taco was also good and when I added fresh squeezed lime that they gave me it was even better. The salsa was very mild and pretty tomato-y which is not my taste but still good  I just don't like tomatoes. However the chips were great , both my sons enjoyed the chips.

    "text": "Honestly was not extremely pleased with this place. It is super cute on the outside! It is a walk up counter that you order at and get your food to stand and eat. To start, they were all out of queso which was not a huge deal. But the menu is also pretty small and tacos are about $4 each. The chicken was extremely dry and did not have any flavor. The beef taco was pretty good but I add some spice to it for flavor. The pork taco my boyfriend got was just okay. They overloaded the tacos which is usually great but ended up just having everything fall out of the entire thing. For sure a messy experience. Glad we tried it but would not probably go back unfortunately.",

From the chips and guac to the nachos, and of course the amazing tacos.  I would say my favorites are the spicy beef and the chicken taco.  I order all of my tacos on the flour shells here.  It seems to hold up to the toppings better and I am just not a fan of corn shells in general.    $3 each for tacos that are filling and flavorful is more than worth it to me.  I am full after two of the tacos and am happy to spend $6 for two filling and fresh tacos.",

We pushed two tables together and sat my daughter (15 months old) on top.  My mom got the loaded nachos and I got the chicken taco and pork taco. I actually liked the chicken taco better. I brought home a chicken and beef taco for my hubby and he liked the beef better. Next time I will try the beef. When I come back it will be when its a bit warmer out since the place really isn't closed off to the cold air.",

After an awkward exchange where I assumed the cashier was ready to take my order I let them know what I wanted, repeating my order after the girl had asked for clarification. After waiting somewhere close to 25 mins, listening as the two employees continuously gossiped in-front of customers, I got my food. One missing queso and two incorrect tacos later, and I'm not sure I'll be back.",

Pretty good tacos! Nachos would've been better if they'd actually filled the container. The meat was awesome (had chicken, pork, and beef) and the toppings were not overtaking the whole taco. Tacos did get soggy in the car ride home but that's to be expected. They still held together well enough to eat! The sauces were so tasty and complemented the meat well. I'll try them again after they've had some time to settle in- you'll gain a star just for adding more nachos to your nachos!",

I wanted to love it because the customer service was great and the place was so cute, but this is the blandest, most unflavorful Mexican I have ever eaten. Meat had zero flavor, chips were prepackaged cardboard, and the salsa had something in it I couldnt quite discern (seemed like ground up corn?). I tried flavoring everything with lime and it came out worse for the salsa and unnoticeable in my taco salad and spicy beef taco. Their hot sauces would be great...on chicken wings, not a mexican dish. Was really not expecting to leave a bad review...so sorry!",

The staff were very friendly and explained the different tacos and the fact that the meats are smoked at the  establishment next door.  Which as if by cue the wind shifted and I could smell the delicious smoked meat waft my way.  I ordered two tacos, I could def have easily eaten 3. They are perfectly sized, full but not overly full.  I ordered the pork taco which was my favorite. It was very flavorful, the pork, sauce, pico de gallo and lime were a perfect combination!  The chicken was excellent. There was just something so perfect about the pork.  I wish they had a way of using baskets if you are staying there to eat, it felt wasteful to use the styrofoam for a quick bite.   There are no seats, but several standing tables to eat. I actually think that is a great way to enjoy the tacos.  The parking is ok, pulling in and out is tricky but doable.",
