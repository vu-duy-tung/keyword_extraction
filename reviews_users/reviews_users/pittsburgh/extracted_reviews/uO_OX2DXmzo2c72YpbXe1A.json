They get A+++++++++++++++ for that!  Very nice ambiance and in the nicer weather months, its a great place to enjoy a meal with a nice bottle of wine for sure.  It was very busy... and they lost our reservation which was a bit frustrating but they were able to accommodate us (Thankfully!).    The steamed dumplings were quite pepper-laden, and their Pad Thai was good but nowhere near as good as a few other places that are in the area.  Their Spicy Eggplant was apparently scrumptious (my boyfriend raved about it but I did not try it).    Service was decent... nothing over the top, but definitely pleasant.  BYOB too which is a nice little plus!",

There's something so transporting about sitting in their garden with twinkly lights, and all the different plants  and jungle ceiling that takes me out of Pittsburgh to somewhere tropical? The food I think is up in the best caliber of thai food that you can get in the burg (and there is a lot of good thai food competition here so that's a big thing).   Pumpkin curry. go get it. All of the appetizers= amazing. Everything under the chef's specialities = super yum.  Basically I'd like to eat here all the time. It's great for a special occasion or a date, or just grabbing some excellent food on a weeknight. I'm a big fan and look forward to my next meal here.",

    "text": "This is officially my favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh - I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review! Their menu is original, and there is not a bad item on it. Choosing an appetizer is a very tough decision, but my favorites are the Garden Rolls and the Curry Puffs. The entrees are also great - you cannot go wrong with any of the curries, and I also LOVE the Kao Soi. On my last visit, I also tried the coconut ice cream for the first time, and I must say - I didn't know what I was missing! I am not even a huge coconut fan, but this ice cream is to-die-for.  They grow a lot (if not all) of their veggies in a garden behind the restaurant, and their patio is a unique getaway that makes you forget you are in Pittsburgh. It would be a great place for dates, as the patio could be quite romantic and it is BYOB (only $1 per person even if you bring multiple bottles!).",

I tried to offer solutions like a limited or chef suggested party menu, but to no avail. When you have a great outdoor location, a reputation for great food, why in the hell would you turn away a large party? I'd even pay extra to rent the space!  So this one star is not reflective of the food because I've never eaten there, and now, probably won't. The one star is for really stupid business practices of turning away a very flexible, easy to please crowd of Thai food loving Pittsburghers. Hope to have better luck with the other Thai restaurant with an outdoor garden.",

And then we found Pusadee's Garden, and are happy to add it to the list.  They have a great garden in the back, and the food is very good. As other reviewers have mentioned, the service is on the slow side, but if you are not in a hurry, it's worth the wait. We had the pad see ew (very good... some of the better tofu I've had in a while) and a veggie pumpkin curry, which was also delicious. Everyone enjoyed their order.  The variety is not as great as you might expect, but what they do, they seem to do well.",

My friend and I were in awe of some of the beautiful trees and plants they have all around.  Would love to have this gorgeous space in my own yard!  I definitely recommend making a reservation so you get the prime outside seating!  (There are a few seats inside, but why?!?) I went with a group of 5 and we wanted to try everything....so I think we did??!!  We all got the Tom Yum soup, which was spicy and delicious!  I mean, best I have ever had!  We ordered about 6 different appetizers.  The best one was the fried Tofu.    Sounds weird, but it came with this really yummy sauce!  I highly recommend. For dinner I got the Panang Curry.  IT WAS AWESOME!  I get a level 7 spice, which is just spicy enough!  If you dont like spicy food, that is no problem!  Just tell them and they will lay off the spice!   Did I mention this restaurant is BYOB?!?  My favorite!  There is a minimal cork fee. Also, this restaurant is not open in the winter.  The big draw is the garden, so they are not open for business once the weather gets too cold.",

And I wanted to go when the actual garden was open!   I'm happy to say that I finally made it to Pusadee's Garden this past Tuesday! Everyone was right...the garden was just beautiful.  Hard to believe that I was sitting so close to the traffic on Butler Street. The temperature was perfect.  Like a little oasis in the middle of a pretty urban neighborhood.  We decided to get starters.  I had some vegetable tempura (with squash and sweet potato) and my beloved had the pork meatballs.  Both were excellent!  For my main course, I had the especially yummy pumpkin curry with shrimp.  My beloved had shrimp fried rice.  He kept stealing the sauce from my curry because it was just that good.  Perfect amount of heat and really delicious.  You could tell that the shrimp in my dish was fresh.    So I feel very happy with my visit to Pusadee's Garden.  It was well worth the wait.  We talked to the owner for a little while after our dinner.  Found out that she has been at this location for nearly 10 years.  This makes this place extra cool.  A place with excellent food with owners that had the pioneer spirit in Lawrenceville.  They deserve all the success that they have today.  Can't wait for the next time I get a chance to get to have the best Thai in Pittsburgh!   Don't miss it!",

We started with shrimp tempura and steamed pork dumplings - both of which I could have easily just eaten a whole plate full!   For our entrees, I had the spare ribs; and, my husband had the crispy tilapia. Pusadee's warns that they are a whole two points higher on the heat scale than comparable restaurants in the area but I'd say my \"8\" was only slightly spicier than I expected. The black pepper and garlic, soy-marinated ribs fell off the bones. My husband's fish was the perfect balance between lightly fried and crispy and delicately spicy as well, with a nice touch of kafir to offset the curry flavors. We both had expertly steamed rice and fresh veggies on the side.  With the Allegheny Wine Mixer and Full Pint Brewing just across the street, I recommend going to Pusadee's for the food and walking a few feet afterwards for a glass of wine or pint of beer. Otherwise, don't forget to BYOB.  Overall, the fast service, intimate decor, delicious food, and very reasonable prices were a welcome backdrop for our date night. I definitely plan to go back in the spring/summer/fall when I can sit in the outdoor area.",

I think the food was above average taste wise but the portions are smaller than I'm used to at other local thai restraunts. I ordered the Kai soi at a 7 because I was told by the server they are spicier than other establishments. I found it to be very mild. With that being said I understand not all dishes are as spicy as others so I won't pass any judgement here. My wife got the woon Sen and hers was spicier than mine and she had a 2.   We will certainly return but wish the portions were larger and the spice was more consistent.  I also wonder what the atmosphere is like when the weather is poor given that they lose 75 percent of their seating when the porch is closed.   In summary worth the stop to make your own judgment.",

I got it with vegetables and my sister got it with chicken. I loved the vegetable version, but my sister thought hers would have been better with some of the vegetables added. The spring rolls were very good.   For entrees, I got the pad Thai w/tofu and she got the green curry with shrimp. We both got a level 8 spice (on a scale of 1 to 10) and both of us kind of regretted choosing the high amount of spice. We both loved the taste of our entrees and wished we had chosen a level 5 or 6 spice level so we could enjoy the food without coughing. Lol  The servers were very attentive and refilled the water frequently. It's a byob, and most tables had a few bottles of wine. Will definitely bring booze next time!",

    "text": "First time to Pusadee's Garden and, I must say, it was absolutely amazing! We sat in their magical garden patio that's filled with all types of greens -- ferns, winding ivy, shading pine trees and much more! Coupled with the absolutely gorgeous and perfect summer-time ambiance is their delicious and quite authentic Thai food. Dishes like spicy basil chicken, Pad Thai, and all sorts of curries can be seen on neighboring tables. Every dish we had, from the crispy tofu appetizer to the yellow curry with roti cani, was delectable and rich with its own hallmark spices and flavors! While seemingly ordinary, Pusadee's Garden is surely a thing but. I will definitely be returning for more!",

Right in the heart of  Lawrenceville, this place served some of the best Thai food I've had yet! I had the pad Thai with medium heat and my wife had the street noodles # 1, both were spectacular! My dish had peanuts and sprouts and fresh flat noodles with the perfect amount of heat and flavor. My wife's dish was amazing, the tempura on the chicken was so light and crispy I could have had that as my main dish. The noodles and the broth were delicious with so much flavor. I want to try everything in. The menu, which is the perfect size, it has enough to choose from but not too many items to overwhelm you. I will be back this spring with a bottle of wine, or even better a growler from Arsenal cider which is just a few blocks away, and sit out in the garden and enjoy a great Thai lunch and a great mid-day buzz!!",

We had a group and were told we had 2 hours to eat before the next group when we made the reservation.  That is good that it was communicated, but the group before us was 20 minutes late in leaving.  We were taken to a waiting area and asked and received some wine glasses so we could relax.    We shared a few appetizers.  The golden bag were interesting, the grilled pork meatballs on a skewer came with some nice sauce to dip, and how can you go wrong with anything tempura so we had the tempura veggies.  I had the Spicy Duck Noodles at level 5, which was just about right.  I like spicy food but want to taste the food too. The duck was tender and the noodles and sauce were very good. SWMBO had the pad thai with shrimp that was very good and not as much a fan of spicy chose level 4.  I managed to get a bite and the shrimp was good but the spice level was higher than 4 probably closer to 7.    PG has a great garden and good food.  Nice place for a relaxing meal.",

Minus the cost of 2 bottles of wine, our bill for 4 people with 3 appetizers was only $76. We had pad Thai, beef kee mao, pineapple curry, and street noodle 1. All excellent. All at a level 3 hotness. I can vouch for the spicy wusses out there... 3 was just fine for me as I generally do not do well with spice. I normally don't like to sweat through my shirt at dinner and 3 was perfect! Reisling was recommended to go with the food. It was a good pairing. As was the cabernet we brought.   Will definitely return.",

    "text": "Oh Yelpers, you've blown this place up in a way that's completely unwarranted. True, the patio is cute enough. Sure, the staff is friendly. Ok, the menu has quite a few tempting sounding options even though its a bit smaller than some other Thai menus. But was it a stellar, 5 star worthy dance on my palate? Nope. Sorry.   Our party of four started with two vegetarian appetizers, the crispy spring rolls and the tempura vegetables. The vegetables were pretty good, lightly fried and crispy,but the spring rolls weren't very delicious. Heavy with a soggy cabbage center. I ordered the Pad Thai for my entree, as I figured that would be a good gauge of Pusadee's Garden's style. My food was forgettable. Not bad, just nothing special about it. Almost bland where I wanted an explosion of layers of flavor. Am I asking too much? I don't think so, because I've had such an experience at another Thai restaurant that I won't bother mentioning here because its not quite fair. There's no comparison! I also sampled my wife's fried rice dish, which to me wasn't worth the calories based on how non-exciting it was.  If I lived close by I'm sure I would occasionally order take out. It was perfectly good Thai cuisine. It just didn't excite me. Am I spoiled? Perhaps. A certain North Side establishment has apparently changed my expectations forever. I'm open to heading back and trying the Kao Soi, one of my favorite dishes. But as of now, Pusadee's Garden stands at a solid 3 stars.",

Came here on a double date, me, the husb, the bff, and her husb. Brought a cool bottle of Robert Mondavi wine. Unfortunately booked too late to get the outdoor garden (shiny lightbulbs!) but got seated inside quickly. We started with the garden roll for appetizers, then did, family style, street noodle #1, red curry with chicken, cumin beef, and grilled salmon. The portions were a leeetttle small for Pittsburgh, but the flavors were great. The street noodle #1 with the fried chicken was the #1 hit, and that we ordered for a second round. The red curry was quickly lapped up. Cumin beef - the beef was a little bit on the tough side and cook use a bit more of a cook or braise and I didn't get much of the cumin. The grilled salmon was fine but not extraordinary. Docking half a star for that.  Service was attentive though they were really enthusiastic for clearing our plates before we were done multiple times, which was annoying and the reason for me taking away another half star. Nevertheless, we enjoyed ourselves and had a good time.",

And it's roomy outside.  I walked through the indoor dining area, which didn't seem as big, but it's probably more readily available, since people seem to flock to the outside dining area. We made reservations, which is probably a good idea. The food was great, lots of great flavors (i love spicy!)  I wish it was open all day long, it would nice for a relaxing lunch.

It took me a good 10 seconds of people staring at us after walking in before I made the move to walk to the back where I found the (front?) desk. No one came to us either so I don't know what to make of that.  We didn't have reservations for a Friday night, but they were able to seat the 6 of us without a wait. The dining area is small and narrow -- it reminds me of someone's living room. The atmosphere is inconsistent, but not surprising since it's in Lawrenceville. (Examples:  dimly lit dining area - elegant, waiters in zip up sweaters - super casual, disposable wooden chopsticks in fabric sleeves - casual + fancy, & noisy - casual.)  For appetizers we ordered grilled pork meatballs (loved the sugarcane), papaya salad, chicken satay, and shumai (pork dumplings on the menu? Anyway, these were small and disappointing in flavor). For mains-- pad thai, see yew, kee mao, and a shrimp fried rice. The portions are a little bigger than Noodlehead's, but not by much considering the price difference. Originally we asked for a 7 spice level, but the waiter told us that it was really spicy. So we went with 6. -- It wasn't spicy ):  Be True to your spice level! Don't let the anyone doubt yourself.",

So was the pumpkin curry and THai fried chicken.  The appetizers were also quite good, especially the grilled pork meatballs & steamed garden rolls.  The fried spring rolls were ok and the curry puffs were quite good but not quite on par with the (somewhat spicier) ones I've had in NYC.

Lots of interesting plants to check out and so many that you feel you have left the city for the Thai countryside.  A truly relaxing experience, so much so that the okay food and the high bill wont even raise your blood pressure.",

    "text": "You know what this place is really gosh darn good! We came here with 6 people around 7 pm on a Friday. The food we had was outstanding all the way across the board 5 stars. For appetizers we order pork dumplings that were tasty little bites The fresh Spring rolls \"Garden Rolls\" only had one roll per order so we order 2 more for a total of 3 because they were so fresh and vibrant tasty rolls with a wrap that has a very neat texture. Also had an app. of Chicken Satay which actually came in the middle of the meal, which was fine by us because we had order way too much much food to begin with, never the less I choked one of the chicken hunks down after I smothered it in that delicious peanut sauce.  We all ordered something and passed it around the table. The most notable dish for me which I did not order was the crispy tilapia. The crispy tilipia is covered in this sauce which tasted very good even with the higher level of spice that was in it. And it is BYOB, I love BYOB at this place because it is like $1 / person. So for all six of us to stuff our faces with awesome food the total bill was only about $125. I would say that is a heck of a good deal. I was happy to experience this before they close for vacation until Feb 14th 2012! Ouch... Definitely on my top 5 list. Oh and I'm not much of desert eater, but I really enjoyed the black sticky rice and coconut ice cream.",

    "text": "Welp, as someone that has spent some time in Thailand, I definitely feel like a qualified reviewer of this restaurant.  This is just one of many fine little gems hidden in the mostly unexplored neighborhood of Lawrenceville in Pittsburgh.  So, the restaurant from a looks perspective.  It's situated along the 53rd block of Butler street in a mostly low-key area of the street situated on the left side (looking toward the higher streets).  In other words, there's not a ton of business development within immediate proximity.  The inside area has your typical hole-in-the-wall vibe going with it.  It's mostly white walls and very simple inside, with maybe ten or so tables lining the entrance corridor and back room.  It has a zen/minimalist style going on, but nothing really special.  Step into the side deck garden, however, and your environment transforms into a fresh, exotic, green, and lush sanctuary with 8 or so tables strewn underneath a canopy of vines.  The environment that engrosses the tables is made from exotic plants and flowers of some indiscernible origin.  Gents, if you need a first or second date recommendation, or need to bring your lady to a nice place for the anniversary, don't pass up the outdoor eating area here.  The ambiance will impress the shit out of her.  The food.  Pretty good.  Went here with a date and we got the fresh spring roll apps, the coconut soup, and the spicy basil with vegetable and the pumpkin curry with vegetable, followed by sweet coconut sticky rice with fresh mango and coconut ice cream.  The apps were 3.5/5, they were good but very simple and came with a sweet chili dipping sauce from what I can recall.  The coconut soup was unfortunately, not that special.  I'd give it a 2.5/5 as I was generally left wanting and didn't actually end up finishing this.  The entrees were both stellar, I'd give them a 4.25-4.5/5.  I had asked for a 10/10 on the heat scale on my dish (pumpkin curry) and got what more resembled a 6 or a 7.  I got \"white spiced\" apparently.  Either that or they are not calibrated to the same heat scale that I subscribe to.  The dessert was very authentic and tasty (though the rice was a bit soggy for my liking), I'd still give it a 4.25/5 for flavor and refreshment value.  Overall impression.  Very cool little BYOB hole-in-the-wall Thai place that uses fresh-from-the-garden ingredients.  Definitely in the running food-quality wise with Nicky's in North Side and Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield.  Their food is definitely well above-average and the ambiance in the garden can't be topped.  All in all, for the fair prices they charge (and again, it's BYOB!), you can't miss this place!",

The garden spring rolls are beautifully made but the portions are a little small as compared to other restaurants. The yellow curry with roti is another great dish.   I will keep going back because it is close, beautiful and kind of good. But every time it will be slow and it will make me sad inside.",

I forget what I ordered, but I know it was amazing because I couldn't wait to come back.  The second time I came for takeout. I ordered the Pad See Ew, which again, was declicious.   The most recent time was this past weekend. We called to make sure there wouldn't be much of a wait, as it was pretty chilly and we wanted an inside table. We were told to come right in. Once we arrived, the line was nearly out the door. Not a huge deal, except we were standing and intermingled between diners who were trying to enjoy their meal. Often we were bumping into them to make way for the wait staff delivering food and beverage.  We weren't looking forward to our inside seat anymore.  Once we got seated, however, it seemed to calm down and we didn't have a crowd of people waiting in line. I ordered the mushroom salad - I was excited to try some new mushrooms I had never heard of.  The waiter warned that it was spicy. Yes, it felt like my entire face was on fire. I had to pack it to go and started thinking of ways to still use it with other foods at home, sans fire face.  My meal was the panang curry with shrimp. It was an amazing party in my mouth. I actually ate it with a spoon so I could get every drop of the smooth, creamy curry sauce. I ordered it a spicy 3/4 but it did feel a little spicier, though it could have been residual fire from the mushroom salad.  All-in-all, my curry was perfect with zucchini, carrots, peppers, broccoli, and shrimp.  I look forward to eating much more of this.  Incidentally, I brought the mushroom salad home, wash it off, and threw it in a zucchini dish I made. The next day I heated it up, laid on sliced avocado, and put poached eggs on top. It was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. I'll most definitely get the mushroom salad to go next time I visit and make something fun and delicious with it.",

There was zero spice but ate it.  Fast forward to my second trip here. We arrived around 5:00 on a Sunday. We didn't have a reservation, the hostess said we had to be done by 7:00 because of a reservation they had coming in. Pretty sure 2 hours would be plenty of time and she didn't really need to say anything to begin with. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai, this time, they remembered the spice. I was disappointed by the number of shrimp that was in my dish, only 3 shrimp for $14, hardly worth it. I still had 2-3 bites of food left on my plate when the waitress came and just took my plate, assuming I was done.  I liked this place the first time because of the patio, but being rushed (we were in an out in under 40 minutes) the second time, leaves a bad taste in my mouth",

    "text": "Pusadee's is one of those places that I go to fairly often, but somehow have never gotten around to reviewing. It's definitely worth a visit if you enjoy Thai, especially in the warmer months when the garden is open. It's lush, green, and beautiful--you'll find yourself forgetting that you are sitting right off of busy Butler Street. If the garden is full or the weather is less than ideal, then the intimate dining room is also a great option.   I rarely deviate from my go-to entree, the garlic sauce with chicken. Chicken and a variety of vegetables are served in an amazingly flavorful sauce of (obviously) garlic and spices. I order my dishes on the spicy side, which only amplifies the flavor of the sauce and I definitely recommend (if you can handle the spice!). Served with white rice, it's a filling and flavorful dish.  I've also sampled a number of friends' dishes over the years, and everything has been superb. Definitely a great spot for a date or a gathering of some friends with a bottle (or several) of wine--don't forget, it's BYOB!",

After checking Yelp to see if reservations were necessary-which they weren't, we decided to bring a party of six to the restaurant thinking it wouldn't be too much. When we arrived, the waitress asked us if we had reservations and she said it was okay if we didn't. Then she asked if we would like to sit outside, even though it was clearly raining. After politely saying no, she said that all of the indoor tables were reserved even though there were many open tables (with enough seats for six people). We decided to leave because of the lack of service given, and unfortunately we cannot say that we will return.",

Asked the hostess for a table for two, she looked kind of annoyed when I said I didn't have a reservation. Ordered the garden roll appetizer which consisted of one fresh roll and was pretty bland. Veggie tempura app which was a couple thin slices of fried veggies. I ordered the spicy basil rice dish with mixed veggies a spice level of 6. It wasn't spicy at all and my rice was complete mush, I got a lot of vegetables though which was nice. My dad got chicken pad Thai which was pretty bland and the noodles were over cooked.   Again not sure why this place has so many good reviews let alone why anyone would go out of their way to call and make a reservation. There are a ton of other really great Thai restaurants in the city.",

My most recent order, the Kao Soi, left me super disappointed.  For $12.50, I got a moderately portioned, relatively bland dish that was mostly noodles (with a few sad pickled vegetables and soggy beef).  The crispy noodles that go on top looked like they'd come out of a box, not freshly fried.  Maybe I have just been spoiled by Noodlehead, where for $9 you can get a 50% larger portion of the same dish that tastes way, way better.  The only dishes I really like here are the pumpkin curry and street noodles with chicken.  But even those are overpriced!  If I pay $13 for curry, it'd better be a large portion and tasty as hell.  I have also had some extremely bad experiences here in the past, like curries that came out so salty they were practically inedible, but I kept giving this place a chance because I want to love it and to sit and eat in that garden!  But at this point, sadly, even the beautiful outdoor atmosphere is usually not worth it to me.",

Came to visit on a beautiful Friday evening without a reservation and the hostess kindly seated us outside, letting us know she needed the table in a little over an hour for another reservation. We chanced it and were out of there in 45 minutes.   We had the pork dumplings as an app and they were good. Softer filling than I'm used to and more binding in them than meat, but it was still very tasty. I had some Tom Kar soup with veggies and it was good but still a tad more sour than I would have liked.   My friend and I both had yellow curry with chicken and Asian sweet potatoes, served with roti. It was the best Thai dish I've had in an incredibly long amount of time. Dark meat chicken and made the dish really stand apart from that those typical overcooked white meat slivers other places give you. The curry sauce was everything you'd want a Thai curry to be, and I'm a ginormous fan of roti bread and theirs was plentiful and delicious.   What really takes this place over the top was the gorgeous patio. I've seen it mentioned in other reviews before but you've seriously gotta see it for yourself. I'd imagine it becomes very romantic once the sun goes down and the lights are up.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Pusadee's Garden for a while, since I'm such a fan of Noodlehead. I ended up coming here with my family and significant other for my birthday dinner this past weekend. We made reservations for our group easily, and our table was ready when we arrived. When we walked in, I immediately noticed the lovely pale-colored walls with simple black light fixtures and vibrant green plants placed throughout the room. It was more high-end looking than most Thai places in the city, contributing to a nice atmosphere overall. We were given a few minutes to look over the menu before placing our orders. We went with a variety of noodle dishes as well as a few appetizers for my youngest sister, who has never tried Thai food before and was unsure of what to expect. I myself had Street Noodle #1, simply because I was curious to compare it to Noodlehead's version. It was delicious, although significantly less spicy than I am used to.   That brings me to one of the three instances of miscommunication we experienced that keep me from awarding this place 5 stars. The spice levels were not clearly explained when ordering, so those of us who wanted spicier food were left wanting in that department. For instance, the first person to order selected Pad Thai and was told the spice levels were 1-5. She made her choice and then myself and one other person ordered Street Noodle #1 using the 1-5 system. The next person ordered Street Noodle #2 and was told the spice levels were 1-10 for that dish. I can only assume my significantly less spicy noodles were due to me ordering a 3 out of 10 rather than the 3 out of 5 that I had intended. I only wish the spice levels were more consistent or better explained, so everyone could have been on the same page. In the future I'll know what to do. The next issue was when my mother requested a few more bean sprouts for her Pad Thai, since it was getting spicy for her at one point. She had been given extra bean sprouts to cool down hot Pad Thai in other restaurants, but was told she could not have bean sprouts in no uncertain terms at this one! I don't know if her request was misunderstood perhaps, but I did feel bad that she had to eat food that wasn't as palatable as it could have been. She's not one to make a fuss, so she smiled and carried on. The last thing was that our handwritten check was missing a couple items, and after the server took my mother's card to pay for the meal they had to return with a check that was $20 higher for her to recalculate everything. She didn't seem to mind, but I would have liked to see a little more attention to detail on that end.   Any one of the above things on its own wouldn't be enough for me to dock a star, since everyone at Pusadee's Garden was unbelievably kind, professional, and efficient. The food was flavorful, if a bit mild at times, and everyone in our group came away satisfied. The atmosphere is top-notch and would be a fun date night spot. I will be returning here often, especially once the warm weather hits, and will update this review accordingly if my next few visits go more smoothly.",

The parking is street parking but there were plenty of free options available when we arrived around 7pm on a Saturday.   Made reservations which was good because we got seated outside in the garden which was the best way to experience the restaurant and saw that a wait was forming just after 7pm.   We ordered 2 appetizers, the crispy crab roll and steamed pork dumplings.  Both came out quickly and hot even though they were pretty slammed.  My wife ordered the pineapple curry with shrimp and I ordered pineapple fried rice with chicken.  The server said they are 2pts spicier than other places so we both got 5/10 spice level which provided a good burn, def a 7 equivalent.  Got coconut ice cream for desert which was good to put out the fire in my mouth from the entree.  Food was excellent and on par with Nicky's for sure.  We will def be back to try more things from the menu.",

Back in college, I used to head here with friends on Saturday nights to fuel the tank right before shaking our asses off a few blocks down at Lawrenceville bars. #BYOBbaby I've also been on dates and meetings at Pusadee's. In fact, I dig this place so much that I even had my graduation lunch there with all family nestled in the garden. Pusadee's is the best Thai experience in Pittsburgh---low key, local, cheap, fresh, charming, and high quality. All the curry dishes are great. What I like is that they are not very sweet, unlike some other restaurants in the city tend to make 'em. Try the Green Curry if you like spice.   *Tips* If you're going on a weekend night during a colder season, try to make a reservation because indoor seating gets tight. If you want lunch on a sunny weekend, try to arrive near opening hours to get a good seat in the garden. Don't forget your wine!",

I simply love it because I think all of the flavors are great... but it seems like there was little difference between most Thai places. Most dishes always seem very similar... it's been fairly rare to ever eat a truly distinctive dish at most Thai places. The only dishes that have REALLY stuck out was if something was prepared poorly.  But I realized my mistake when I came here. I've always tried ordering the usual suspects at most Thai places... pad thai, pad see yew, or any of the curries, etc... but I went out on a limb and ordered something called \"Street Noodles #1\".. and I am completely obsessed with it. It's rice noodles sitting in a spicy, savory broth with mung bean spouts and bok choy, topped with slices of perfectly crisp, juicy chicken breast. It's the only thing I order and the only thing I think of now whenever I crave Thai food.   And being seated in the garden during a warm, breezy day can't be beat. It's gorgeous.   oh, and you can byob :D   I almost want to discourage people from going because the seating is so limited... it's a good thing they honor reservations.",

    "text": "In what used a be a shady corner in the dodgy end of Lawrenceville, now exists a miniature restaurant district, reminiscent of Bryant street in Highland Park.  On one side of the street you have Cure (my 2nd favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh) and Allegheny Wine Mixer (a really cool wine bar, one of the only ones in town).  Across the street is Pusadee's Garden, a Thai restaurant with a fantastic outdoor patio on the side completely hidden from the street.  The garden is really the restaurant's big draw.  There's a small indoor seating area but the majority of the seats are outside.  The outside area is split into two halves, with one half having small tables with umbrellas and the other underneath an ivy-covered trellis.  On a recent Saturday evening my wife and I were meeting another couple there for dinner and in typical Pittsburgh fashion, it was pouring down rain.  We called the restaurant to make certain our reservation was still OK and they said it was.  By an incredible stroke of luck, the sun came out right before we sat down.  Unfortunately, that meant that everything was covered with rainwater.  It also meant that during our entire dinner rain dripped on us, our food, and our wine.  The menu is standard Thai fare: curries, noodle dishes, and a few \"garden specialities.\"  We started off sharing crispy chicken spring rolls with plum sauce, chicken satay with peanut sauce and cucumber relish, and thai fried chicken with a sweet and spicy sriracha sauce.  It was all very tasty.  For entrees my wife had \"street noodle #1\", rice noodles with bean sprouts, bok choy, and more thai friend chicken.  I had a rice noodle dish with grilled duck breast, vegetables, and a spicy black soy sauce.  The duck was well done (not a way I normally like duck, but typical for an Asian restaurant) and the sauce had a nice spicy flavor.  Like many Thai restaurants, they ask you for a spice level of 1-10 for your dish.  I like spicy food so  I opted for a 6 and was glad that I did not venture higher.  Pusadee's Garden is BYOB only and everyone around us had a varity of wines and beers.  Corkage was inexpensive, only $1 per glass. Overall cost of dinner was very reasonable and added up to about $40 for 2 people.  Overall, we felt Pusadee's Garden was a good Thai restaurant.  The cuisine is standard Thai and honestly no better or worse than any other Thai restaurant that I've been to. There's nothing here that's going to push the envelope of Thai cuisine.  The BYOB option is nice and the garden is a very nice place to sit (when it's not raining).    Why only 3-stars?  Well, according to Yelp, 3-stars = A-OK which is how I feel about Pusadee's Garden.  It's a standard Thai restaurant with a nice outdoor seating area.  It's not someplace I would ever specifically seek out, but it's a good option if you're in the mood for Thai and there's nice weather outside.",

We ordered fried chicken and Thai spring rolls for starters. The fried chicken was tasty, crispy on the outside and well flavored inside. I'd never had any Thai spring rolls before. The herb (basil? I think) was too strong for me.   I had very spicy kee mao for entree. Boy they did not hold back on the chili pepper oil! It was SPICY! I had my nose running and eyes watering (so if you were on a date, I'd suggest not asking for too spicy) . And for a spicy food lover, it was AWESOME!!Most of the time when a restaurant marks their dishes spicy, they usually end up \"meh\" for me...  Service was very slow though, maybe due to a lot of people there. We were kicked out immediately after paying the check because another party was waiting for the table already lol hot place!",

I'd been wanting to try this place for some time.  I called on a Saturday afternoon, right when they opened up (around 4pm) and was able to make a reservation for a table in the garden area at 8pm that evening.  In preparation, a trip to the local Wine & Spirits was necessary. We picked up a bottle of Kung Fu Girl Riesling, which pairs well with spicy Thai dishes.  And now, on to the food!  Based on recommendations from other Yelp reviewers, I went with the Pumpkin Curry with Tofu.  It definitely did not disappoint!  The curry was sweet and just a little spicy, with tender chunks of kabocha squash and zucchini throughout.  I ordered a side of brown rice (subbed for white for $1.50) and washed it all down with my Riesling...I was a happy girl!  I can't properly review Pusadee's Garden without mentioning the beautiful ambiance of said garden.  A trellis covers the patio seating area, allowing vines to grow and create a \"roof\" over the patio.  Strings of twinkling lights, flowering plants, and wrought iron tables transport you from Butler Street to a tranquil Thai garden.    The food and ambiance made up for the severe lack of friendly service.  I don't think our waiter spent more than 30 seconds total with our table, but I didn't even care.  It gave me more time to enjoy good company, good food, and good wine!  I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat and can't wait to return this summer.",

All were delicious, and I'm not always a fan of mango.  I had the crispy tilapia, which was great, but practically room temperature; we decided to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt, and surmised that it wasn't supposed to be piping hot.  In any case, flavorful, crispy, spicy-- heaven!  Our vegetarian friend was very happy with her rice curry with tofu, which we all tasted and loved.  The third entree, bean thread noodles with vegetables, was also a winner.  The garden really is lovely, green and lush, a nice setting for a relaxed meal with friends.  If I were to compare it with Nicky's Thai Kitchen, I would say that Pusadee's food is better, by far.  Also, although Nicky's garden has a nice Thai/pan-Asian decor, it is cramped.  Pusadee's garden is roomier and airier.  Overall, a wonderful experience.",

I've had the crab fried rice -- pretty good but even if you ask for a 10 on spiciness, it seems to only come out to like a 2. I've also tried the street noodle #1, when I had it the spices were unique and delicious -- would definitely get this again!  All in all, a cute place for a chill night out.

So if you boast such a wonderful garden in the summer... what do you do in the winter? You make awesome food so people come back! I'm one of those people that can sometimes end up going to ethnic restaurants and ordering the same thing over and over. I know, super lame. But I get scurred! Considering the couple we were with raved about the street noodles, I went out of my pad thai/curry comfort zone.  I have to admit, I've only had street noodles once at Noodlehead in Shadyside and these were way more flavorful! I ordered up Street Noodles 2 with rice noodles and fried shrimp. I could tell right away it was way more filled with more zesty ingrediants. Competition's on the horizon Noodlehead!   I like that it's BYOB, so you can bring your fave bottle with you. I will say, the dish isn't large, but just right. Let's just say, I was satisfied, but definitely ready for dessert later! But isn't that kinda the best of both worlds?",

So already, that's a plus.  We did show up a bit before our reservation time, but didn't have to wait long.  The outdoor area has a great ambiance and is actually well hidden from the busy street.  Inside seemed a little cramped.  We had a small table for two.  Service was a bit slow but I'm willing to forgive because I think they just squeezed us in.  We first ordered spring rolls and crispy tofu appetizers.  I don't know that I've ever really had a bad spring roll.  But that tofu with that peanut sauce is in a class by itself.  I never thought I'd eat and like tofu!  While waiting for our main dishes, I ordered (and got my friend hooked on) the Thai iced tea.  Mine was almost gone by the time my Street Noodles #1 order arrived (rice noodles, bean sprouts, bok choy and Thai fried chicken).  The dish was very flavorful and that chicken was nice and crunchy.

    "text": "I had heard so much about this place and since my love for Thai food has no bounds - a visit here was a necessity. A nondescript exterior (similar to Nicky's!) opens to a bright and comfortable interior dining area which, although small, was sufficient if you wanted to eat inside. Our goal was to eat outside and we were seated in a delightful garden setting sheltered from the threat of rain by the cover of plants and trees. The menu was more limited than I had expected but there were plenty of options and we had no trouble choosing our appetizers and entrees.   Interestingly, there were no daily specials which I thought was a bit odd. We started with the veggie spring rolls which were tasty if not a little overly crisp. We also had the tempura vegetables (kabocha squash and sweet potato chips) which were good but a little greasy. I could have sworn the squash was actually potatoes and not squash.   I ordered the red chicken curry and my wife had the crispy tilapia. Also at the table we had tofu fried rice and pad thai. I tried to put aside my previously related bias towards all things Nicky's and approached this with an open mind. Alas, it fell short. First off, the selection of food options, especially in the seafood area, is no match for other Thai restaurants I've been to. Secondly, the range of flavors is far more limited. There wasn't that spectrum of unusual and delightful flavors I'm accustomed to when I order good Thai food. Third, the depth of flavor was severely lacking. Hints of Thai spices were there but the flavors fell flat and felt uninspired. All four of us commented along the same lines.   The red curry was actually yellow in color and lacked the zip I look for. As you know, I always order my Thai food \"Thai hot\" but since this was my first time here, I only went with 9 on a scale of 1-10. It was not a 9 and didn't even wake up my taste buds. I know it's difficult to accurately and consistently replicate heat/spice levels, but a few red flakes floating in my curry is clearly not enough to elevate it to top heat levels. It was disappointing. My wife's tilapia didn't do it for me either and the \"spicy three flavor sauce\" was neither spicy nor have much flavor and the fish sat in what looked like a greasy pool on the plate.   I think they're worthy of a 2.5-3 star rating since I feel a little generous and I need to compensate somehow for my Nicky's bias. I will certainly give them another shot but first impressions leave me disappointed. There are far better options around town for delightful Thai food.  If you're looking to try Thai for the first time, perhaps this is a good starter place. Then you can move up to really good Thai - go to Nicky's on the Northside. Still my favorite. No comparison",

I recommend going anytime of the year, but especially in summer!",

    "text": "Wish I could give 3.5 stars here because that's exactly where I am on Pusadee's Garden. The garden space is really pretty with overhead grapevine trellises providing shade & seclusion and a treat in Upper Lawrenceville. The inside is comfortable, modern & really well done, too. The weather cooperated and we got seated outside.  The menu is smaller than many other Thai restaurants in the city but I found 2 appealing seafood dishes - I just love fish with Thai sauces and spice, so it's where I typically gravitate. We started with crispy spring rolls and tempura veggies. They do tempura pretty well here and it's an art to get it right.   I ordered the crispy tilapia which promised a mix of 3 special Thai sauces & lots of veggies with #6 heat. The sauce was more of a thick rub & the veggies were stuck in the rub but the fish was indeed crispy. It tasted really good but there was no sauce for my rice and one of the things I really appreciate most with Thai food is the sauce. Fortunately, hubby shared ladles of his red curry sauce to help me out.  Admittedly I compare every Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh to Nicky's Thai on the Northside which I consider pretty darned perfect. Pusadee's atmosphere is very appealing and I happily enjoyed their food, I've just had better.",

It's True folks, their outdoor garden dining area make you feel like you some where no where near Butler Street!  I had their shrimp pad Thai and it was my favorite. It was a great portion and was full of flavor. I appreciate that they will ask how much heat you'd like as well, as I'm someone that doesn't like things too spicy. The service was a bit slow, but it didn't stop us from enjoying ourselves. It also helps that is is BYOB so we weren't waiting for drinks. I cannot wait to go back because as of now, it's my favorite Asian restaurant around!",

They also have plenty of other great dishes and appetizers to choose from. We ordered the crab rolls, steamed pork dumplings and chicken satays, all delicious and came with excellent sauces. Oh yeah, and its BYOB! Can't beat that. And to top it all off, it is very affordable. Will be spending many more nights there this summer.",

    "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know what you are thinking. \"ANOTHER 5-star review from this guy?\" OK, I guess I do hand those out, but I honestly believe that I've gotten fairly good at avoiding the places that won't be good; thanks to Yelp and all of you guys, so there's a little bit of selection bias going on here... That being said, on to my review of Pusadee's Garden...   This place is INCREDIBLE!! I recently stumbled upon a few really nice reviews for the place, and figured that today would be an opportune moment to take my family out for a nice Sunday lunch here.  The entire experience did not disappoint! The photos on this page definitely do this place justice, although I must say it is even more quaint in person. The indoor space is quite nice as well, for those frigid or sizzling months when you would not really want to be on the patio...  We had the garden rolls, steamed pork dumplings, woon sen (bean thread noodles, egg, and vegetables), and spicy seafood. For drinks, we tried the tamarind juice, mango juice, and Thai iced tea. Not one item was \"meh\" or uninspired - honestly, I felt as if we had been invited to a Thai family's home for a delicious home-cooked meal made from scratch with every dish. Here's the breakdown:  Garden rolls - delicious \"salad in roll format\" with tasty veggies, thin rice vermicelli, and tofu. Served with a delicious spicy sweet and sour sauce  Steamed pork dumplings - tasty home-made dumplings served with a really nice mildly spicy soy sauce  Woon sen - very tasty clear bean noodles, served with egg and a ton of delicious fresh mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. Mildly spicy - they ask you how hot you want it when you place the order, so it can be adjusted to your tastes.  Spicy seafood - very nice plate of jumbo Thai shrimp (6), green mussels (4), and squid, served in a very tasty spicy sauce with tempura eggplant and rice on the side.  Drinks were spectacular too - everything tasted home-made. Wow. It's BYOB and the glass fee is totally reasonable if you want to bring something to enjoy. Service was good - nothing rushed, but it wasn't slow for us - dishes came out in less than 10 minutes from when we ordered, even with the garden patio being full. I hear it's wise to make a reservation here if you want to have dinner, since it is rumored to get pretty crowded at night...  Just. Wow.  I think we have found a new go-to place for Sunday lunch and Friday dinners!! They were also very friendly to our little one, which earns them props... Will definitely be back to try a bunch of different dishes in the near future!",

Sometimes I dream about eating in their patio in the summertime as sun is setting.  The wind will blow through my hair, I will be laughing as the waiter uncorks my BYOB wine and pours us another glass.  I digress...I must also recommend the kao soi it's delicious.

    "text": "We absolutely love Pusadee's!! It is tied with Nicky's Thai Kitchen as our favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. It breaks our hearts when they close for the winter, but we know that come spring we will be enjoying their delicious food once again!   We have eaten in and done takeout here many times, so this review is much overdue.  Takeout service is always quick and efficient. We are usually enjoying our meals within 30 minutes after calling and picking up (compare this to Thai Place in Aspinwall, which always gave us a 45 minute wait due to being \"busy\" but never had anyone eating in the restaurant when we arrived...).   The indoor space is sparse but functional. There are simple tables and chairs, and not much decorations on the walls. Their outdoor space is gorgeous and generally what people go for when eating here. The garden is lovely and relaxing, with lights strung up around the beams and simple plants making the space inviting and relaxing. We attempted to eat outside yesterday, but gave way to the heat and ended up indoors. Someday soon we will enjoy our bottle of wine in the garden!  We typically order two different dishes and share. We start out with the fresh garden rolls, which are delicious. It is a small order, but the perfect start to a meal. The vinegar sauce is light and refreshing, but I do prefer the peanut sauce that Nicky's offers with their spring rolls. We have had the red, green, and pumpkin curries, and our favorite is the green. The sauce is more complex than the pumpkin, even though we love the pumpkin chunks! There are numerous fresh vegetables in each that soak up the wonderful sauce. We also share an order of brown rice, which is worth the extra cost. I recently had Thai in NYC, and I have to say that I loved the curry at Pusadee's much better! Their blend of spices and coconut milk is simply perfect.   Pusadee's and Nicky's will continue to be our favorite Thai places here! I am so glad that Pittsburgh has more and more options for great Thai dining.",

We went to Pusadee's on a rare warm Autumn Saturday night and we were able to get outdoor seating at 930 after making reservations that day.  The garden is very romantic: a great place to take a special someone, sit outside, sip some wine (BYO) and enjoy some fantastic food. We had a group of 6, and there were larger tables towards the back of the patio that were perfectly accommodating. Warning: advance reserves are highly recommended, since that visit, I haven't been able to make same day reservations! We did it right- family style- and tried nearly the entire menu.  My favorite items were the curry puffs, the street noodles number one (topped with delicious crispy thai chicken), and the eggplant curry (spicy and delicious!) I'm still dreaming about the crispy chicken, but haven't been able to get my fix because they're always so busy! I'll definitely be back... If only I can remember to make reservations...",

    "text": "If Pusadee's Garden repeats or improves upon my experience this evening, it may get bumped to a 5. The girlfriend and I had a long week and planned a much-needed date night. We'd heard good things about Pusadee's and drove past it's attractive patio several times, so we decided tonight we'd give it a try. We were pleased that the garden roll ($3) and cabbage salad (\"thai cole slaw\" w/a spicy tamarind-peanut sauce; $6) were gluten-free, so we were able to share those as appetizers. The garden roll was most definitely THE BEST I've had in Pittsburgh and maybe ever. Perhaps the ingredients were particularly fresh today or maybe they are this awesome everyday, but I will definitely be back, and soon, to find out. (Do note, however, that the menu says garden roll, and they mean roll, singular.)  The cabbage salad was delicious with the perfect blend of sweet and spice. For our entrees, I went with the veg & tofu pumpkin curry (kabocha squash, zucchini, carrots & basil; $12) with the \"brown\" rice. The curry was spectacular (though I dock a point for not including \"green bell peppers\" among the ingredients listed on the menu because I hate them and had to pick them out because I didn't think to request that they be excluded since, you know, it wasn't listed as an ingredient)--the squash was deliciously sweet, the tofu was a perfect texture and quite tasty (!!!), and there was a nice blend of veggies. The \"brown\" rice was actually a hearty blend of brown and red rice (my favorite) for which I didn't mind too much paying the $1.50 \"upcharge.\" GFgf had the kao soi (egg noodles, shallots, pickled mustard greens, yellow curry sauce; $11.50) with vegetables and tofu, substituting rice noodles for the egg to make it GF. I was too busy swooning over my own dinner that I forgot to try hers, but I got the impression she was quite pleased with her choice as well. We both agreed that it was the best Thai food we'd had in Pittsburgh (and we really like Thai food).   The service was pleasant and reasonably attentive, if a bit jumbled at first. It seemed that only one young man was attending to the entire interior dining room, which reached near capacity just shortly after we arrived. Unfortunately, that also resulted in the noise level spiking to unpleasantly high levels, no thanks to all the hard surfaces in a small enclosed space. We're very hopeful that the weather will be more pleasant the next time we come so that we might enjoy the beautiful patio area.   It won't be long before we're back!",

For our starters we had Tom Yum spicy-sour-lemongrass soup (divine!) as well as the garden salad with fresh veg from the raised beds near our table.  The waiter recommended (at our request) the specialty dishes.  We selected the Woon Sen egg noodles and Eggplant Basil.  The food was exquisite, authentic, and really set this restaurant apart from other Thai establishments. Even our dessert, black sticky rice with custard, tasted delicate and distinguished.  The service was excellent.  We highly recommend the Thai iced tea, but be warned it may not pair well with your entree.",

As we walked towards the front, it looked closed on first glance because it was completely empty. The reason the interior was so empty because we choose the first beautiful day in PGH to visit and the outside seating is this restaurants REAL dining area.I am looking forward to returning to this outdoor dining experience when all the foliage is grown in and a bit later in the evening to get the real ambiance of this Pittsburgh jewel. The negative of the outdoor seating is the location. The patio is RIGHT next to Butler St. which made it a bit noisy when large trucks or loud motorcycles would pass.  We were seated immediately and given glasses of water.    The service was average, nothing great, no problems either though. Nothing really to comment on.  The food, however, was the star of the evening. I ordered the Thai Yellow Rice. The chicken was crispy and cooked perfectly. The rice had great flavor, and I had the option of spice level, and choose the medium one, which was not very hot. My girlfriend had the pad thai which was delicious, simple, and not heavy with spices and marinades.   The prices are super reasonable and we will definitely frequent this place in Law-ville from now on. If you are a fan of Asian foods and would like a great place to eat, this is a MUST go.  One side note, this place is BYOB and they mean it. People around us brought bottles of wine and beer. The menu said there is charge of $1 for a glass. I do not know if they would charge to drink out of a beer bottle or can.",

The fresh spring rolls came with such a unique flavored sauce and it was the perfect sized appetizer so you had plenty of room for the main course! I had the Pumpkin Tofu Curry and it was amazing! The flavor was rich and fresh and the brown rice came in a little pod which was a great presentation.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I tried out Pusadee's after stumbling around Chowhound one day looking for new restaurants to try out.  Since we had no idea what to order, we asked the server for recommendations.  He suggested their pork meatballs as an appetizer and said it's all about the special noodles and fish.  Most people end up getting their Street Noodle #1.  We ended up getting their pork meatballs, which were absolutely delicious.  I want to say the meat was minced by hand with a tad of baking soda for it to achieve such a fine texture which remind me of the meatballs at Chinese dimsum places.  The seasoning was right on spot; I've had too many under/over-seasoned meatballs to take small things as the proper amount of seasoning for granted.  They come skewered on sugarcane which added to the presentation and were fun to suck on while we waited for our entrees.  I asked Pusadee what her favorite dish was, as opposed to the most popular dish.  She first noted that I might not like it b/c it's spicy but told me it was the spicy tilapia.  I love spicy, and I ordered it.  My friend ordered their Street Noodle #1.  The spicy tilapia dish was a lot larger than I had imagined; it was five pieces of fried crispy tilapia with a copious amount of the spicy sauce.  The sauce itself wasn't that spicy, but it had lots of strong Thai flavors with a sweet touch from caramelized onions.  I tried some of the Street Noodle #1 and it was pretty good.  The thinly sliced crispy chicken wasn't as crispy as I would have imagined, but all the flavors were spot on.  Some finishing notes:  What I found interesting was that I didn't see ANYONE in the restaurant order curry at all.  And Pusadee and the waiter didn't recommend them either... Get reservations.  It's a small restaurant and the first thing we were asked was if we had reservations. Because it's a bit further away from the \"hot spots\" of Pittsburgh, parking was ridiculously easy. If you want to try the tilapia, get a friend to order something else and split the two dishes.  It comes with no vegetables and Asian cuisine is all about splitting dishes anyways.",

    "text": "LOVE this place for delicious Thai dishes and its outdoor garden patio (so wonderful for a summertime date night with a shady arbor and twinkling lights!). I went last night 8/04/2013 - I made a reservation for 8:45 (just in case ... it does get really busy here, and the seating is limited) and was seated promptly with my date in the garden. We had the Garden Roll and Fried Pork Dumplings for a starter. The Garden Roll (in a tapioca wrapper) was very fresh and full of basil and mint flavor. The Fried Pork Dumplings were exquisite with a zippy sesame dipping sauce - so crispy and savory. I had the Spicy Basil Rice with Beef, which packed some subtle heat (I ordered a 6) - just enough to give an extra kick to the flavor. If I were feeling more adventurous I would probably get an 8 or 9.  The meat was very tender and perfectly seasoned - the veggies were still crisp and zesty. My date's Red Chicken Curry was perfectly presented and very yummy. Lots of lovely color in every dish. Portions are generous, but we cleaned our plates. Would love to go back and save room for dessert!  Service was prompt, very friendly, and not overly intrusive. Frequent water fill-ups :).  It's best to make reservations and go on a temperate night to make the most of the outdoor seating. Only complaint is that the metal chairs could use some cushions for comfort, especially if you want to linger over your meal.  At around $12 - 15 for an entree, this place is a great value!",

My curry dish came out in a tall square bowl, which looked interesting, but compromised on functionality.  Once I had eaten a sufficient amount, the remaining chunks of meat and veggies were completely submerged in the sauce, leaving me groping around with chopsticks hoping to find purchase on some chicken.  It was tasty enough, but nothing above and beyond other Pittsburgh Thai places (which admittedly set an unusually high standard).  I tried a rice noodle and chicken dish one of my companions ordered as well.  The chicken was phenomenal, but the noodles, rather than being spicy-sweet, were just overly and cloyingly sweet.  Roll all of that up in mid-level prices which aren't exactly a bargain, and it doesn't make my \"best Thai in Pittsburgh\" list, though it might be \"best Thai in Lawrenceville.\"",

While there I shared the Spicy Basil Leaf, Chicken and Street Noodle #2. The basil Chicken was definitely the stronger choice, since it packed a lot of flavor and contained a lot of nice veggies like zucchini. The Street Noodle #2 was pretty satisfying but nothing too special. It also reminded me a little too much of ramen.  While the food was high quality, the part that makes this place a must-go is the garden. Make sure you eat outside in the garden. It's absolutely amazing what a little place they have carved out of Butler Street, especially considering next door is an abandoned lot.   Long story short: good food, really unique/beautiful atmosphere.",

When we arrived the place was in its usual chaos and they did not have us placed at a table but clearly had our name on the reservation list.  Since the inside space is very mediocre, we looked outside despite the drizzle, but were told all the covered  tables were reserved. We agreed to be seated inside but were then informed that we only had an hour because someone had reservations. We also had a reservation which seemed to be overlooked. And it appeared we were paying the price of not being on the table template. So we could not sit inside and could only be outside if we sat in the rain. We left the restaurant. Not sure what kind of customer service this is, but not for me. I will not return. Nor will I recommend this restaurant. Is this a case of too big for your pants.

Not only does it have some of the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, but it's outside seating is absolutely beautiful on a nice summer day. In the evening hours, everything is lit up and the ambience cannot be matched anywhere else in Pittsburgh.  The service is great but can get a little bogged down on busy nights. The food is flavorful but conventional Thai fair. Their most interesting deviation is their street noodle dishes, which I don't see on too many Thai menus in Pittsburgh.  Their heat scale is hit or miss. I've had a 10 here and while I perspired profusely, I felt like I was still not experiencing the dish as it would have been served in its home country.  While Pusadee's Garden did replace the only Filipino restaurant in Pittsburgh (to me and my girlfriend's chagrin) it replaced it with a formidable Thai component in the slightly over-saturated Thai food market of Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "First off, let me say I'm a huge fan of Thai food (and love spice).  There are a handful of good Thai restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, and this is definitely amongst them.  It's a little jewel tucked into Lawrenceville, and despite my being in Pittsburgh for many years I hadn't tried it until this past year.  The outdoor seating patio during warm weather times is wonderful.  I've eaten here several times now, and I literally lose myself there sometimes--on warm summer nights it feels like you're eating dinner in a quiet South Beach restaurant instead of Pittsburgh.  That being said, I should mention that the indoor seating on the other hand is a little cramped.  So...food...yes.  Have gotten the Thai Red Curry, Thai Green Curry and Panang Curry--I know, I know, so cliche.  But they were great--not necessarily anything better than any other good Thai restaurant, but undoubtedly tasty (I mean, I've only ordered standard dishes, so what else can I expect except for standard food?  But they were all well made dishes).  It did tick me off the one time I ordered Thai-Iced tea without too much ice, and the server gave me a half-full glass of tea.  Umm, I make this stuff at home, so I know it doesn't cost anywhere near $2.95 a glass.  So when I ask for a little less ice, please don't insult me by giving me less drink, too.   Anyway, when I'm in the mood for Thai, the reason I pick this Thai restaurant over the others is specifically for the ambience of their outdoor seating patio.  The food is good, and the pricing is average.  Can't go wrong.",

    "text": "This charming Thai restaurant has lovely atmosphere and delicious food.   For vegetarians, the trick with Thai food is that traditionally most of it is made with shrimp paste, fish paste, fish stock, etc. as the base flavor for the sauces and broths. While many of the items appear to be vegetarian, they are frequently not and you are left to the mercy of the servers, hoping they have the correct information about their food or that they are willing to tell you the truth about what is in the dish. Depending on how the recipe is made, some cannot be altered because of how the food or sauce is prepared ahead of time. During my visit to Pusadee's Garden I felt assured that our server was knowledgeable about the items on the menu and how they are made. She easily pointed out which ones were within those limits and it seemed that our group wasn't the first asking those questions.  The last time I visited was in the summer when the garden was still open. I ate with friends next to their organic garden where they grow some of their vegetables that they serve. It was relaxing and very pretty. The meal I ordered--a noodle dish--was delicious as was the salad that came before. My friends all reported the same--that their food was really on the mark.",

It's perfect for sharing a bottle of wine (its BYOB) and trying their traditional, but inventive dishes.  The Curry is outstanding - particularly the Pumpkin Curry. I got it with tofu at a spiciness of 6, which wasn't all that spicy, but delicious nonetheless. My sister got the Tom Kah soup (her favorite Thai dish), which she claimed was the best she had ever had. We also tried the Curry Puffs, which were sweet and delicious, and the Fried Tofu, which was absolutely wonderful - much better than your standard Fried Tofu appetizer. Theirs wasn't over-fried and came with a delicious, delicate sauce. My boyfriend got the Khao Soi, another traditional Thai dish, and it was wonderful as well. Extremely flavorful with fresh toppings like cilantro and lime.  The deserts are interesting as well - they have many homemade ice creams and also traditional Thai dishes like the Mango Sticky Rice.",

I always like to start with the amazing garden rolls, crispy crab rolls or the curry puffs.  For a main entree try the Pinapple Curry with Chicken or the Kee Mao. Always make a reservation and be patient with the servers.  It is so worth it!  BYOB is sweet too! My only complaint is that they close from November through mid-February.",

Their vegetable spring rolls are perfect, crispy & not greasy. Absolutely love the Tom Kar soup. It's creamy coconut soup with vegetables. Any of their noodle dishes are delicious.  Their outdoor patio is probably the best outdoor seating place in Pittsburgh. Except when I saw a large frog/toad hopping around the patio last time I ate there. I'm sorry not my thing...especially around where I'm eating.  If you're a fan of Thai food you must eat at Pusadee's Garden!",

I was reminded of that also at our arrival. I felt like they were trying to get rid of us even before we started. The setting would be so lovely, being outside in a garden. It's hard to get trough your meal without being attacked by flies from all over.  With previous experience with scale of spice 1-10, I would recommend to stick with lower numbers. My boyfriend asked for #7 and I have no idea how he was able to eat it. He was in tears but he eat it.  The food is good but since my last experience I don't really have the desire to return.",

    "text": "I have been hearing about Pusadee's for far too long from a good friend of mine to have not gone. Last night was my chance! It wasn't a perfect meal but it was the closest thing to it, given the circumstance. It was a Saturday night and insanely busy. We were sat and there was a decent wait to order. The serving assistants were keeping us well hydrated from our bike ride and it was evident how busy they were so we did not mind.   We decided to share food in order to get the most of our experience. To start, we got crispy crab rolls, grilled pork meatballs and tom kar (sometime tom kha) soup. The crab rolls were pretty good although I probably would opt for a spring roll next time. The meatballs were really good and came on sugar cane skewers that added to the entire experience. Our soup was good but we did ask for a spice level 7 and there was no spice I could distinguish. We let our server know and he came back quickly with a new, spicier version that was perfect.   The main even was our shared entree of kao soi. It is a chicken, noodle and yellow curry dish that was spot on! They certainly did not leave out the spice this time! We devoured our entree in record time. I would only say that I didn't see much of the shallots and mustard greens mentioned in the description on the menu. However, I ate it too quickly to be positive that there should have been more. Overall, it was a great experience with a wonderful staff and even better food!",

    "text": "I visited Pusadee's Garden with a friend this past Sat. at 6pm with a friend.  She was in the mood for Thai food, I wanted to visit Art All Night, and the weather was nice, so Pusadee's seemed like an obvious choice.  I called and made a reservation a couple of days ahead of time, and they told us the 6pm would be fine as long as we were finished by 7:30, which wasn't a problem.  Given that the weather was nice, we opted to sit in the garden.  As many other reviewers have pointed out, it's absolutely lovely, providing a serene environment for a casual meal.  On the day of our visit, the weather was perfect--neither too hot or cold or windy--and the umbrella over our table, with the trellises, shielded us from the bright sunlight.  While I was aware that Pusadee's is BYOB, I opted not to bring adult beverages given that my friend is sensitive to alcohol.  Instead, I ordered my favorote Thai non-alcoholic beverage--a Thai iced tea ($2.50).  While this one wasn't quite as good as the one I had at another nearby Thai eatery, it was respectable nonetheless, and was also rather large.  For food, we started out by ordering the fresh spring rolls ($7).  They were the perfect accompaniment for Thai food served in an outdoor garden environment--light, fresh, and delicate.  They tasted like salad in a roll, and the basil dipping sauce that came with them served as a flavorful yet light dressing.  For our entrees, I ordered the street noodle #2 ($13), and my friend ordered the pad kee mao ($13).  Similar to a version of this dish I tried at Noodlehead, the street noodle dish consisted of egg noodles interspersed with sprouts and bok choi topped with a generous helping of Thai fried chicken.  The portion size was the same as--or perhaps slightly smaller than--that of the corresponding dish at Noodlehead, despite the price being $4 higher.  I didn't try my friend's kee mao, but she seemed to enjoy it, and a similar comparison seemed to apply.  I was happy with my specified spice level of 4/10, but my friend, who's Chinese and ordered 8/10, wished hers was spicier--next time, she should order it Thai hot!  Overall, we were generally pleased with our meal at Pusadee's.  Although the service was rather mediocre, the food was decent--not the best Thai I've had in PGH, but certainly not the worst, either.  As others have said, the garden is the most unique aspect of Pusadee's, so be sure to visit when the weather's nice so you can enjoy the lovely al fresco dining!",

    "text": "I was really excited to try Pusadees Garden after rave reviews from friends. Stopped in around 8PM on a Thursday evening, and stood and waited in the front for a few minutes before walking through to the back room to find someone to seat us. We were immediately asked if we had a reservation, which we did not. Immediately  I sensed that the employees were annoyed. I'm not sure why it mattered, as the restaurant was mostly empty. We wanted to sit outside but were advised that since we didn't have a reservation, there wasn't room for us there. After briefly stepping outside, however, I spotted more than a few free tables. Rude.  Our waitress seated us in the front room and poured us water as we swatted away a small swarm of gnats. She returned and brought us glasses for our crowler of beer ($1 charge per glass), and asked if we were ready to order. Um, no. we sat down less than 60 seconds ago.   She came back about ten minutes later and we placed our order - Tom yum soup and the street noodle #1 for me, and tom yum soup and the pad kee mao for my boyfriend. Our waitress didn't bother to ask for our spice level which we both found strange - we eat Thai food pretty frequently and we like it spicy.   Our food came out relatively quickly and it was mediocre - not a hint of spice, and the portions were small and unimpressive, especially for the price! There were also no condiments on our table, sriracha or otherwise, and none were offered. I immediately understood that this restaurant is most likely popular because of the pretty seating area outside.   About 15 minutes after our food was served, our waitress came to our table again to drop off our check - and then she just stood there. I still had food on my plate and was clearly not finished. I looked up at her and she asked, \"You ready to pay now or do you need to sit for a little bit?\" I have never been rushed out of a restaurant before and I will never come back here.  Overall, service is zero stars.   Food gets two stars because it was not bad, but not spiced at all, and definitely inauthentic/underwhelming.  Atmosphere was bland, and there were gnats and flies zipping around us the whole time we were there. If it were one or two I'd excuse it - but this was gross.  I will never come back here.",

There are string lights and the you really feel like you're in the middle of a garden.  It's amazing the owners were able to set this place up in an area that feels so incredibly industrial.  You're completely hidden away from all of that while enjoying outdoor seating.  The food was delicious.  I appreciated that the waiter asked each individual for their desired spice preference.  I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken (at a 0 spice level because I'm a baby!) and I thought it was the best I've tasted in Pittsburgh.  We were a large group and they accommodated us nicely.  I didn't hear complaints from anyone and it seemed pretty calm in the restaurant for such a busy evening. I also didn't feel like we were being kicked out even though we most certainly overstayed our welcome.  It's BYOB so we brought our own drinks as well.  You can easily turn this into a dressy occasion because the atmosphere is so nice, but you could also go in a T Shirt if you wanted.  The only issue came when we tried to figure out the bill at the end of the night.  Perhaps we should have requested in the beginning for individual checks but the waiter informed us it was impossible to split the check and they would only accept a maximum of two credit cards.  I think that would have been nice to know ahead of ordering, and it frustrated us as a group.  I think if they updated this system, then I would give them 5 stars because it felt very outdated.",

I am unsure if it is because the restaurant is getting busier and not capable of managing? Or if there is some other reason.   Mostly the service has declined, and there have been several occasions where my take out order has not been correct; completely wrong dish or zero flavor and spices. I really enjoy the food, but the prices have gone up and the portion size has become significantly smaller.

So much greenery, flowers, and lighting. Also, the staff is so wonderful. They are so kind, so attentive, your water cup will be refilled before it's halfway gone. Everything on the menu is so great. They have a wide variety of various noodle dishes, curries, soups, great appetizers, etc. etc. The best green curry I've ever had was here. Their dried chili flakes pack the greatest punch and are so fresh.  Typically I stick to the same noodle dish at Thai restaurants, but here I actually enjoy trying all new menu items because everything proves to be better than the last and so consistent. So happy to hear they purchased the lot next door so they will be expanding the restaurant (both the indoor & outdoor seating). However they'll be closed for most of 2018 for the remodel, and hope to reopen by end of summer 2018.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love Pusadee's Garden, especially hearing how it's often compared to the famous Nicky's Thai Kitchen (in North Side and downtown). Unfortunately, Pusadee's did not really do it for me.   Even in the winter time, the outdoor area is lit beautifully. There was only one other table of diners other than us on the Sunday night of our visit, making it incredibly quiet. The restaurant was very dimly lit, almost too dark actually.   The menu was rather small. I didn't see my favorite soup, Tom Kha, on the menu which was a little disappointing. In place of my usual soup order, we ordered the Garden Rolls. The hubby ordered Pad Thai with chicken and I ordered the See Yew with tofu. The Garden Rolls didn't seem all too fresh as the outer rice paper wrapper was a bit hard. The rolls were loaded with veggies, which I could taste mostly of spring lettuce mix. I kind of felt that to be a rip off and you also only get one roll (cut in half to give you two pieces) for $3. The Pad Thai was ok. The hubby liked that it had a slice of lime for garnish which he hasn't seen many other places do. However, it lacked the smoky flavor he has gotten from Pad Thai at other restaurants. The See Yew was quite disappointing. The flavoring was good, strong of soy sauce flavor, but I did not like the noodles. I've usually had See Yew with really wide, chewy rice noodles. These noodles were not as wide, making the texture different from See Yew at other restaurants. Our food came out very quickly, but my See Yew was not heated through. I'm not sure what shortcut they took or how long it sat prior to getting to our table, but the temperature made it that much more undesirable.   I'm not going to give up on Pusadee's just yet, as I'd like to try the curries. A trip in the summertime to experience the garden is definitely in the plans.",

I've heard so many amazing things about this place and surprisingly, it was a Thai restaurant in the burgh that I haven't been to!   It was a gorgeous day, so we sat on their outdoor patio. The patio is awesome and definitely made me forget that the restaurant is located directly on a very busy street. Our waiter was awesome and was very friendly. I ordered the veggie fried spring rolls as an appetizer and we also ordered the pork meatballs on sugar skewers. For $4, I was disappointed that the spring roll appetizer only came with 2 small rolls. They were good, but not worth $2 each for how small and average they were. The pork meatball order came with 4 and they were delicious.   My boyfriend ordered chicken fried rice, I ordered tofu pad Thai and my boyfriends brother ordered ginger chicken. I tried them all. The fried rice was nothing special, but good none the less. I really enjoyed my pad Thai, although the tofu was not prepared in the way that I had hoped. It was undercooked and mushy. The ginger chicken was awesome and packed with flavor- my favorite out of all the meals by far.   I am disappointed to give this place 3 stars, maybe I didn't order the right meal- I would love to go back and give them another shot! They are BYOB and I wouldn't mind kicking back on their outdoor patio again :).",

    "text": "I couldn't be happier that I stumbled across this gem of a restaurant on Yelp. I am a big fan of Thai food and regularly get chicken pad thai.   I was easily moved to try this restaurant when I seen the pictures of the outdoor garden. Let me just say pictures don't do it justice. I am all about finding restaurants that have unique outdoor dining and this one is at the top of the list. It was filled with colorful flowers, vines and string lights. There was plenty of seats available outside, more so than inside seating. Some tables had umbrellas which was nice if you wanted shade.   I almost diverged from my usual chicken pad thai; but in order for me to compare my experiences from places like Noodlehead and Nicky's Thai Kitchen, I wanted to stick with what I know and like. I really enjoyed my meal and found it to be very flavorful! I enjoyed it more than the chicken pad thai I ordered from Nicky's. The only reason I held back on 5 stars was due to the price. Noodlehead's chicken pad thai is better priced at $9 compared to Pusadee's priced at $13. I also think Noodlehead might give you a little more. But none the less that will not stop me from returning and trying some different menu items!",

I rarely make it out of the appetizers, though since they have some good ones.  One of my favorite things on the menu is the spicy Thai cole slaw.  I've tried to find a recipe for this so I can make it at home but nothing compares. There is plenty for a vegetarian to eat here.  The food is tasty and I like the service as well.  (Although the last time we went, it was pretty crowded (folks waiting for tables) so you might want to make a reservation). The dishes are all prepared with care and the spice level can be adjusted to your liking. They also have black sticky rice with Thai custard, a traditional dessert not found in many restaurants (here in Pittsburgh, Thai Cuisine has it as well). Highly recommended! They do have outdoor seating, weather permitting but I've not yet dined outside.  I think it is also BYOB since I saw many couples with wine or beer in tow.",

Service is quick, professional and extremely helpful. Food is gourmet. Pad Thai with Chicken, Urban noodles 1 and 2 as well as coconut soup. Many heat levels to experiment with.

Look, I mentioned that I work in the biz, fine dining at that, & I'll break it down for ya real quick....2 hrs at your table at a busy restaurant is what you get. They're right up front about needing the tables & ask politely for you to limit your stay so they can accommodate everyone who wants to eat their tasty food and the server can make a living. It is not your living room, it's a business. Notice they boo-hoo, but admit they were told up front about time constraints & said okay. LOL. Also, for the guy who called 'for a place to eat after 9' and gave the place one star & scathing review? Dude, they CLOSE at 9pm. Bring it down a notch. You should be happy they cooked for you.",

We started with crispy spring rolls and curry puffs. The spring rolls were on par with what you'd get anywhere else but the curry puffs were really great! Just enough pastry to keep the curried vegetables inside, but definitely not too thick. I had the street noodles #1 and my boyfriend had the yellow curry with roti. The rice noodles were super light and delicious, but I was ready to wrestle for that yellow curry! Flavorful and sweet with a bit of a kick. We both got a 4 for heat which was pretty mild.

I decided on the Eggplant Basil while my date had the Spicy Seafood.

Our entrees were wonderful and the heat was just right.  Keep in mind we both had runny noses and extra sips of water from time to time but the food was very enjoyable.  We ended the meal with Sticky Rice and Mango-yum! What a romantic place that makes Pittsburgh great.  Nothing overly fancy -beautiful atmosphere and great food.  By the way, the reviewer who waited an hour after reservations were made, had horrible, rude service and bad food had to have had some other issues ruining his evening.

    "text": "We came here on a Sunday evening in summer, on a double date with some friends.  We made a reservation, but there were a handful of tables to spare for walk-ins.  We were seated outside in their garden, which is a lovely patio decorated with little lights, and covered in flowering plants.  It feels secluded and private, and it's easy to forget that there are other patrons around you.  We brought two bottles of wine, which our served opened for us - even brought us an ice bucket for the white wine.  It's only $1 a glass to BYOB which is a pretty sweet deal.  Service isn't speedy, but it's definitely at a relaxing pace.  You have time to swallow your appetizers before your entree shows up, and nobody slams the check down next to you when half of your pad thai is still on the plate.  Gotta love that.  We started with the Grilled Pork Meatballs - four of them come skewered on sugar cane and they are delicious!  Juicy and succulent and flavorful.  They didn't come with a \"dipping sauce\" as advertised, but there was a little bit of sauce drizzled over them, so maybe that's what they meant?  For my entree, I got the Spicy Duck Noodles at a level 5, which ended up being the perfect spice level.  It was definitely spicy, giving my mouth a kick, but I wasn't sweating and gasping and diving for my water glass.  I'd get food at a level 5 here again next time - I like being able to feel the heat without my taste buds getting too numb to get the other flavors.  The duck was tender, the broth was savory, and the noodles were slurpable.  Not much veg in the dish, but it was very tasty nonetheless - super fresh, and I actually finished the whole thing!  I ate it so happily that I didn't have even remember to taste my boyfriend's Massaman Curry, which he said was delicious as well.  I think Pusadee's and Kanok are really on par with each other - great, fresh Thai in a beautiful setting.  Worth the money for sure.  It's several steps above your average Thai takeout, and I hope we'll return to Pusadee's again before the summer is over - that outdoor patio is just fantastic!",

    "text": "After a day of unsuccessful apartment searching, I was randomly craving Thai food.  I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a shot even though it was a bit out of my way coming from downtown.  I can truly say that I was glad that I made the trip up to Lawrenceville because this place is legit.  First of all, service is friendly, prompt yet not overbearing.  The ambiance is quiet, chill, perhaps even romantic.  Would be a great date place.    The menu selection is very extensive for a Thai restaurant and the prices are very reasonable.  I had the Tofu Spinach soup as an appetizer and the  Eggplant Basil \"Garden Special\" for the entree.  Both dishes were simply outstanding.  I felt that the chef did a great job balancing the amount of sauce and veggies in the Eggplant dish.  Just enough sauce to adequately coat the rice, but not too much as to overwhelm you.  I left satisfied and certain that I will try this place with friends when I move to to the burgh.",

We let the host know how many people were in our group (four adults and one child) and he asked if we placed a reservation. We hadn't and didn't think it was going to be a problem, but it kind of seemed like we were inconveniencing him. He received a call and talked for about five minutes before hanging up and seating us outside.  The patio/\"garden\" was lovely. I especially liked the pitcher plants! We ordered a street noodle dish with shrimp tempura, a soft-shell crab dish, green curry with beef, the garden fried rice with chicken and ate family style. We didn't have to wait long for the food and everything was delicious. The service could have been a little bit better though; at one point three of our water glasses were empty and my husband had to flag down a server to have them refilled.  Overall a good dining experience. We'll be back (probably in the evening when the patio is lit!) and maybe we'll make a reservation next time.",

    "text": "In sum, this place is your typical Thai Food place in Pittsburgh. I would say where it does beat its competition is location, location, location. It appears this place is still a \"hidden restaurant\". It is so far up Butler, I think most people do not even know this place exists. When I came here on a Friday night there was still plenty of room to fill and no wait list! Yay!  I ordered the coconut soup w/ shrimp. It was good, the broth was simple yet rich.  It lacked some lemongrass but it was good. Quite honestly that was my favorite dish of the evening. For my entree, I ordered the ever so traditional Shrimp Pad Thai. Which again was your typically Pad Thai. Sadly, nothing blew my mind away, I would not necessarily tell everyone I know to eat here. Then again, I won't say it is bad either. It is by and far superior than its competitors in Bloomfield so this place has that going for them.   I would say if this restaurant had a bit more expedient wait staff, and dropped their prices a bit, I would feel more compelled to return. I wanted to love this place but I am more indifferent with it. I may give it a second chance in the future merely due to the fact of its proximity to my home and the lack of bustle. Perhaps I caught them on an off night.",

My friend and I shared them and then each had a curry - our bellies were perfectly satisfied.  If ever you're having a down day - go here. It will make the whole day worth it. If ever you're having a great day - go here. It will elevate it into pure bliss. The garden is amazing. I would pay to just go and sit in it, let alone eat a meal. It's completely trellised and well maintained. You are truly surrounded by plants/twinkle lights and it just gives you a zeal for life. Each breath feels so special. Great date spot, lunch spot, eat contentedly by yourself spot, really any day, any occasion spot.  Parking is really easy too since it's pretty far up Butler!  Do yourself a favor. Go! Now!

Sitting out in the garden was so peaceful and the perfect place to relax on a nice summer day or night.

Our food was really good, here's what we ordered.  -Crispy Spring Rolls - came with 2 for $4.  Really crunchy and the spicy plum sauce was awesome! -Street noodles #2 - Loved the tempura shrimp in this dish! -Chicken Cashew Rice - I was expecting more cashews, but the flavor was really good.

    "text": "This is a perfect little Thai restaurant located in Upper Lawrenceville. Went here with a group of six for dinner, and we had a wonderful time. Even though we had only reserved seating for five, they were quickly able to rearrange the seats for us to accommodate our extra person. The atmosphere was lovely - you walk into the front door of the place through an archway of vines and exotic plants. Inside, the restaurant is soothing and refined - very much like stepping into a Buddhist meditation room. We sat at the back of the room with a window looking out into a gorgeous, magical little garden and outdoor patio. I wish it had been warm enough to eat outside!  Ok, on to the food. I ordered an appetizer of crispy crab rolls and a main dish of basil chicken. It was a little simplistic for me (I like trying exotic foods) but the seasonal menu was geared toward fall flavors like pumpkin and butternut squash, which I'm not really into, so I went for something tried and True.   The appetizers are all small, which is not how I'm used to seeing them. Typically in American restaurants you get one appetizer for the table, but here we all ordered our own. I soon realized it was because each plate simply had two small pieces on it. It was actually perfect, because I didn't feel like a glutton ordering my own finger-width rolls and couples could easily share an appetizer plate and get sort of an amuse-bouche before their meal. The appetizers I did find to be a bit pricey for the amount you get, but then, I was ordering seafood so I chose the most expensive one on the menu. My main dish was affordable though, so it made up for the pricey starter.  The basil chicken dish was absolutely perfect. The waiter made a big deal about ordering based on spice level, and said three was considered their \"medium\" level. I like spicy dishes, so I went with that and was inordinately pleased with the pleasant kick that paired well with the sweetness of the basil without overpowering it. Another person at my table likes very very spicy food and found a level six to be too low to make his ribs truly spicy, so keep that in mind when ordering yourself. The basil dish had bell peppers, zucchini, and onions sauteed together with chicken, along with a small side plate of rice. The portions were just right and I was able to finish my dish without lugging leftovers home.   For twenty dollars I felt like I got a great, authentic Thai meal in an intimate, pleasant restaurant. By the way, they don't serve alcohol, but they do allow you to bring your own drinks and have a one dollar per glass fee, which I think is a good deal.",

    "text": "Never in my entire life have I been treated worst than poop at a restaurant.  I have been working extremely long hours lately and was looking for a late night place to eat after 9 pm.  I first found Pusadee and since they closed later on Friday and Saturday, I figured we could go there.    To be sure we did not come at a bad time when the kitchen was closed, I called in and asked if they had seating and if I could order ahead to eat there upon arrival.  The lady said sure and took my order.  Upon arrival, the food was all in to-go containers in a plastic bag.  I was puzzled so I told the ladies there I specifically asked to eat there and called them before coming out of courtesy to ensure no issues.  A server there, looked to have goth style look with dark make-up gave me perhaps one of the dirtiest looks I have ever seen.  She actually stated to me that their restaurant is NOT A PUBLIC PLACE and I should have made reservations.  This idiotic conversation went back and forth for ten minutes before finally they said there is an empty table outside by the gate.  We went over there and sat down.  No one came by to provide any plates, silverware, water or napkins, etc.  In fact, no one bothered to even approach us at all that night.  We removed some crap off the table to start unpacking our to-go order.  Since we had nothing to eat with, I was forced to go to my car to get folks, napkins and bottles of water.  We cleaned up after ourselves and left, frustrated and pissed off as hell.  So, forgetting that incident a few days later... the better half wanted Thai so I figured we just will get take-out only from now on since they made a big stink about eating at their place.  I showed up and paid; as I was doing so, some dude (maybe the owner) straight up told me I did not tip 20% last time.  Again, emotions started stirring up when I asked him when this was.  To my surprise, he said that when we ate outside the other day we should have tipped the server a mandatory 20%.  WTF!!  They did not provide a damn thing and treated me like a third class citizen that day now scolding me for not tipping??!!  We were pretty much yelling back and forth about this subject and in disbelief I just told them I was sorry for ever visiting their restaurant.  This place is a joke and you cannot pay me to come back to this hellhole.",

They have lots of beautiful and delicious drinks like Thai iced tea & coffee, and mango juice. Every dish looked incredible but I was especially happy about my chicken pad see yew. The appetizers were the best part, though, and I highly recommend the crab rolls and fried chicken. Both came with great sweet/spicy sauce pairings. The entree spice levela can be selected from 1-10. I think it is safe to say our entire group had a great meal here.  The bathrooms were immaculate and well kept. BYOB but there is a $1 per drink per person fee.

And I've been in restaurants that have absolutely no atmosphere, but serve the most amazing food ever (like Udipi). But Pusadee's comes somewhere right in the middle, with great ambiance, decent food, and fast service. Though there is arguably better Thai food in the area, no other Thai restaurant comes with transplanting you into a tropical garden, with also top notch and friendly service.  Reservations are recommended, as everyone wants to sit in the garden, and tables fill up fast. Upon making reservations, we were also politely told that the next reservations for our tables started two hours later (a little tongue-in-cheek nudge not to rudely \"camp out\" at the table when done with dinner. And as a former waitress, I giggled and appreciated the tip to GTFO and respect others' reservation times.)   There are a lot of great options for veg-heads. We started with Crispy Spring Rolls and Curry Puffs - both which were super crispy and flavorful. My husband had the Tofu Kee Mao - which had a nice heat to it. And I had the Tofu Cashew rice dish, which was pleasant, and the perfect amount of food. For dessert we shared the Mango Sticky Rice. It was ... interesting ... but I also didn't know what to expect. It's warm and sweet, with a texture that I'm not sure how to describe...but the flavor is really delightful. I'm just weird with textures.  BYOB & Bring Your Own Dessert is also available for $1/person.   The garden is absolutely stunning. It felt like sitting in Blue Heaven in Key West - sans the random wild chickens running around. All of the trees...the hanging plants...the flowers...the string lights...creates such a wonderfully romantic and tropical feeling environment. This alone is worth it. Even with the Sun still blaring outside, all of the trees and leaves still offered more than enough coverage, yet there were still umbrellas to offer more cool shade. I would come here once every season just to experience how different it looks.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience and we'll probably return for the Fall to see it when the leaves change.",

The inside is very tiny. The outside has a large overgrown patio of flowers, trees and lights like a tropical patio in Thailand.  I walked up to a beautiful overgrown lanai with wooden shelters and comfortable patio seating. It was magical inside the garden and surprisingly there were NO BUGS! it was packed so call ahead.  I tried the garlic seafood which was good. They ask you what level of hot you want. My waiter was nice and attentive.  All in all the experience of sitting outside on this beautiful Lanai was worth at least one trip. I would like to go back again sometime and try other food.",

A friend and I lucked out going here back in the spring one day it just so happened to be beautiful out and boy was I glad because the inside isn't all that appealing. Which is a the main reason I could only give them 3 stars. If it's not a nice day I probably wouldn't visit this restaurant.   But enough about the restaurant itself, let's talk about the most important part, the food. I ordered the Thai iced tea and the tom yum soup to start. This was my first Thai iced tea so I don't have much to compare it to but it seemed a little too sweet for my liking. The tom yum on the other hand was the best part of my meal. The fresh veggies with the lemon flavor in the soup was delicious. I'm a huge sucker for intense lemon flavor though. As my main dish I went with my go to pad see ew with tofu. Definitely wasn't the best pad see ew I have had. The tofu had a very mushy texture which I wasn't a big fan of. It could have had a little more sauce but other than that I think it was still a good dish.",

What this place makes up for in subpar inner space, they make up for in the outside which is like an absolute fairy tale garden with plants everywhere, and a big tree whose vines climb a very large arbor which spans across most of the setting.   Eating outside was a very pleasant and enjoyable experience. There were 10 of us, and the staff was extremely attentive. We had reservations at 5:30 and the tables were ready at 5:20. Once we ordered food, it only took about 10 min to get everything for so many people. Only complaint with pricing was the BYOB fee, which is $1 per head, unlike the sister restaurant Noodlehead, which is a base fee of $1 or less.   Now, comparing the food to its sister restaurant Noodlehead, I believe the dishes were very similar. Atmosphere was completely different. Noodlehead is much like a more Americanized Thai dining, whereas this was more realistic.   Food was excellent. Everyone who ordered was happy with their meal and had no complaints. I ordered the Kao Soi, which was a noddle dish with a curry base. The curry spice levels range from 2-10, so I ordered a 2. For someone who can't deal with spiciness, this was a perfectly doable decision. The meal portions were average, especially for what you pay for. None of us had any leftovers, which says a lot coming from 10 small girls. They definitely get you with little extra add-ons unfortunately. But overall, this is a great date spot or celebratory get-together.",

The indoor area is small, but very cute. The restaurant is definitely in a great location in Lawrenceville!   I ordered an appetizer of the Thai fresh spring rolls with sweet basil sauce. Loved the sauce and it was a really light refreshing app. For our meals we had Street Noodles #1 and my brother had the Fried Rice with Chicken. I love spicy food. I've literally won t-shirts for eating hot wings. We ordered 5's thinking that would be a mild heat. 5 is hot as h-e-l-l. We found out that 4 is actually the middle on their heat scale... (??). Wouldn't recommend 5 or higher to anyone who doesn't LOVE hot stuff and know that's not the actual middle of their scale.  I'd go back to eat in the garden.",

That was the highlight of the visit - the food was very mediocre and forgettable. Fast forward two years and we decided to give this place another try. We sat inside this time. We walked in the door on a Sunday night - the place was about 60% full, but we were completely ignored by the one server who was running around the dining room, and the woman at the back who was more interested in taking calls for takeout orders. We stood at the front for a good 2 minutes, then we decided to walk to the back to try and get someone's attention. We were still ignored. Minutes later, we were finally seated, without any kind of greeting - very rushed. We almost walked out.   We ordered Tom yum vegetable soup, spareribs with rice, and eggplant with basil and chicken. The soup was extremely disappointing, while the mains were decent but nothing I couldn't make myself at home. All very mediocre as I remember it. Options are very limited in the menu. Portions could be more generous for the price, and the actual gravy that came with the dishes we ordered was non existent. We are both spicy eaters and ordered spice level 10, but it was practically spice level 1 or 2. Coming from That region and having travelled to Thailand a lot, we know Thai food. This place is so mediocre, and it really didn't help that the service was awful. I really believe the only reason they're still surviving is because of their beautiful garden. Will definitely not be back by choice. Very unauthentic Thai food.",

We started off with the crispy veg rolls, which were delicious. For entrees we had shrimp fried rice, red curry with chicken and kee mao. The waiter did warn us that 3 is a medium spice level (as compared to 5 in other restaurants) So always order a spice level or 2 lower than what you usually have at other places.

Highly recommend the grilled pork meatballs served on the sugar cane skewers. I'm not sure which is my favorite part, the deliciously seasoned meatballs or gnawing on the pork infused skewers.",

    "text": "My husband and I love Thai and so we traveled to Pusadees Garden for our wedding anniversary.  It was on a weekend, around lunch time. The outside garden is beautiful, but it was August, so we opted to sit in the cooler inside. It was not busy but yet, but after we were seated, we waited about 20 min for our drink orders to be taken. We ordered the shrimp tom khan soup and Thai fried chicken as appetizers. The soup was more of a broth with a few slivers of mushroom... though the shrimp was very well done. I guess I expected something with more substance, maybe more veggies. The Thai fried chicken we found was dry. For entrees I ordered tofu pad Thai and hubby ordered chicken see yew. The pad thai's tofu was not fried, so that left noodles and tofu with no texture. The sauce was sort of a generic pad Thai sauce, without the complexity of the sweet, sour etc. The see yew was equally disappointing. The sauce again, not very flavorful and reminiscent of more of a basic Chinese brown sauce. Maybe for those that think ambience supersedes the food, Pusadees is a great place..but it was not for us. Next time we will just go to our fav Thai place, Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield.",

    "text": "I have yet to find a Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh in which I really love both the curry and the noodles. I have been to Pusadee's Garden twice. The first time, my boyfriend and I shared the red curry and the Pad See Ew, and the second time, I went with a friend and had the Pad Kee Mao. I didn't like the noodles. Both noodle dishes were too sweet for me. My boyfriend agreed about the Pad See Ew.   The reason that I am giving Pusadee's Garden 4 stars is because we both really loved the garden seating and the curry. The red curry was creamy and thick and only could have been improved by more spiciness (our fault - we overestimated the spiciness and ordered a 2 or 3). I will be back anytime I am craving curry (which is often!)",

If there was one thing that could have been better that would have been the service (took us 20 min to get our mains), but with an ambiance like this that was barely noticeable.   All in all PG is probably the best alfresco dining scene in the city & reservations are highly recommended.",

We ordered a spring roll appetizer, which was fresh, delicate, crisp and the sauce was perfect. I could have eaten a plate of these for dinner.   I did the pumpkin curry with chicken ; and the BF had eggplant basil. They give you a choice of 'heat', from 1-10. I'm a little girl when it comes to spice and went with a 5 ... which was still considerably spicy. The BF went with an 8, but in tasting his the sweetness of his sauce balanced the spice really well. Both dishes were served with white rice (brown rice is $1.50 upcharge - meh). Portion was large enough for leftovers (yay!).     This was hands down the best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh. The sauces had well developed flavor, rich but not overwhelming. Will definitely be back (maybe for lunch, since prices are more or less half of what the dinner prices are).",

I think they actually did a very nice job with it; you are surrounded by all sorts of pretty plants and leaves, and you're even shielded from the sun by plants above you. It's a great atmosphere for eating Thai food in particular. That said, the food here is great as well. Portions are a bit smaller than say Thai Gourmet or Smiling Banana Leaf, but they make some good items here. The noodle salad was very flavorful with the added herbs, and the street noodle #2 came with a generous portion of shrimp tempura. A solid choice on a nice sunny day!",

I had green curry with shrimp and brown rice   (Again...extra 2.00 for brown rice ....ridiculous).  My green curry was good...many shrimp but veggies were blah. Minimal broccoli, eggplant was burnt nd no zucchini .  Flavor was OK. Hubby was charged for al seafood at $21 .  Lots of seafood but for the value was low. If it wasn't for the garden...we wouldn't be back. Smiling Banana Leaf if much better for price and flavor.   I really wanted to have a better review.  $50 fo an app and two entrees is too much.

GREEN PAPAYA SALAD-- legit, spot on with the flavor!  definitely get this, I don't see it served in many thai restaurants!  CRISPY TOFU-- tasty but came with a sauce that was 90% peanuts, 10% sauce (um more sauce over here, please?)  CRISPY TILAPIA --good, fried, and flavorful, but it had sauce just piled on it that I couldn't really recognize that it was fish (did not remind me of some of the beautiful fish dishes I saw in Thailand)  SOFT SHELL CRAB--good, fried, with some curry sauce on top, but came with some pathetic limp vegetables  THAI ICED TEA--hit the spot!  I gotta ding them for the service of some of the hired help.  I shouldn't be told over the phone when making a reservation that I need to be out of my table by 8 pm because there's another party coming in.  Whoever I talked to really needs to check himself!  In addition our waiter just plopped our food down in front of us with a real lack of effort that made me feel like he just threw food at me.  The owners, however, seem very courteous and brought us our leftovers themselves.    Overall, food was okay for what we paid for, over 50 bucks for all the above.  The garden, however, will have me coming back before it gets too cold to try some of the noodle dishes!",

The menu is nearly identical to Noodle head in terms of selection, but the prices are slightly more as they take cards. However I found the food to be less hot here compared to Noodle head - a 7 here was more like a 2 or 3 at Noodle head.  The noodles were amazing though, as were the appetizers. While it may be difficult to find the entrance, once you do you'll be rewarded with a great meal and a great view. However it may not be worth going across town for, if you're near Noodle head.",

The hours clearly state they are open until 10pm, yet by 8:30 they started turning up lights, sweeping the floor next to us while we ate, trying to signal is to leave. How ignorant ... We put up with your over priced, poor quality, greasy, generic food so we could bring our own bottle of wine and relax in peace. We even tipped 18% and then you show us your appreciation by basically pushing us out the door. Never again ... We won't be back!",

For the longest time, I thought this was an Indian restaurant for no other reason than the name sounded Indian. Whoops!  After Ms. Pittsburgh Yelp Community Manager was on the KDKA morning show talking about the city's best patio spots, I decided to take a look at the menu. I had always been pining to try PG because their patio looks so inviting. I was pleasantly surprised to see more than just your typical Thai dishes. I was also intrigued that they had a couple noodle dishes that sounded similar to what my beloved Noodlehead has. I immediately added PG to my Yelp! Bookmarks and started planning out when I could get my rump over there and drift away in their fabulous garden.  I hadn't had good Tom Yum soup since I lived in Philadelphia, that is, unitl I tried PG's! The lemongrass broth was perfectly spicy with the perfect blend of carrots, mushrooms, zucchini, and broccoli. Heavenly! I had ordered the vegetable version, but they also offer chicken, tofu, and shrimp.   I ordered the Pumpkin Curry on the rave reviews of my fellow Yelpers and it was the perfect choice! Based on the menu description, I don't think they use pumpkin per se, but a similar squash. Nevertheless, it was delicious. Very similar to a yellow or Masamun curry in flavor and spice level. I was also happy that the chicken version came with a nice medley of veggies.   I will definitely be back!",

It somewhat smelled like the elephant exhibit at the Zoo (order it and tell me I'm wrong). The desserts were what saved the day at this place. The two sticky rice dishes were incredible.

My dad and I still cant figure out how they keep the outside looking so gorgeous, but it is seriously a beautiful hidden gem in Pittsburgh...a must see.  Bobby and I met my dad on a Sunday night for dinner because Daddio wouldn't stop raving about the place.  I ordered the Thai iced tea - I wasn't sure what to expect, but I am a huge fan of an iced chai tea latte and it reminded me a lot of that!  Very good, but I wouldn't normally just order it to drink as my meal.  We all split the Thai fried chicken and it was very good - tender, moist and perfectly fried served with good sweet and spicy dipping sauce.  Bobby got the street noodles 2 at a level 7 and thoroughly enjoyed it - even though he was sweating bullets through the entire meal!!!!  Dad ordered the pumpkin curry at a level 4 and I don't think his craving ever leaves him for it!  I tried the spicy seafood dish.  I ordered it at a 4, but probably could've handled it better at a 3 (I'm a wuss, I know).  Our server was super nice and informative and the place was actually pretty busy for a Sunday evening.  The perfect night for it too!",

What I mean by that is, we got there at 9:45pm on a Saturday (traffic) and even though they close at 10pm they seated us without annoyance. We burst through the door like a couple of savages and the hostess just smiled at us and said \"Just the two of you?\" The outdoor garden is so beautiful and transports you to a different place. Food was outstanding. But be warned: SUPER SPICY! I asked for a level 3 which I consider to be mild but my mouth was on fire. I know, I'm not your typical Indian because I can't handle spicy food but 3 was over the top for me! Huz is much better about it and could've handled a 6 or 7 but he also thought it was pretty spicy for a 3. Anyway, amazing food, amazing service, amazing all around.",

    "text": "I stopped by here with my fiance for dinner two Saturdays ago.  We had been looking to come here for quite awhile and finally found a night when we were able to.  It was shortly after 5 whenever we arrived and we were asked whether we had reservations.  We did not but thankfully were still able to be seated in the garden so long as would be done by 6:30.  The garden area is beautiful with many different plants and gives off a vineyard/European bistro type feel.  While we did not bring any wine, we saw that almost every other table had since it was BYOB.  My fiance and I decided to start off our meals with the fried tofu and then I went with the pineapple curry, spice level 10, with chicken for my entree.  The tofu was good as it had a nice sweet n sour sauce to dip it in and the breading was nice too.  The only part that I think could have been better was if the inside tofu was a little firmer.  Shortly after the tofu was cleared, our entrees were brought out to us.  My curry was good with the spice level being perfect for me.  There was an ample amount of items in it and whenever I had finished the rice that it came with, the waitress asked if I wanted some more.  Overall it was a good meal in a beautiful setting.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future. Hopefully next time we will have a bottle of wine and reservations to enjoy both the food and ambiance.  **UPDATE**  I visited for a second time tonight with my fiance and parents.  Since we didn't have reservations we were stuck inside which was just fine by me.  My food wasn't nearly as good, it lacked some of the good flavors from the first time and our service was also pretty slow.  Due to that, I knocked my original 5 stars down to 4.",

    "text": "Making it a point to try a different restaurant each week I decided to come here. I ordered the garden salad with ginger dressing and the crab fried rice. The salad was okay as I really didn't taste much, but it might have been due to this medicine I took earlier for my injured hand. The crab fried rice on the other hand was very good and hit the spot. I also ordered the custard served over black sticky rice for dessert which was exquisite and scrumptious.   My only criticism was one of the servers stopping to place used dishes on my table so she could reestablish herself. It was an honest mistake and understandable in that she wanted to ensure she had all the dishes secured as she was bringing them back to the kitchen. Yet in an effort to stress good practices and ensure an unadulterated dining experience for patrons, I'd just encourage staff to stress these points and for servers to think and plan ahead when carrying dishes. This is meant as constructive.  I liked the location as it was in a quiet area. The main dining area did seem a little cramped and the set-up was a little unconventional as the hosting area looked to be in the back. As a result, I walked through the dining room to get the host's attention.   In any case, the detractions I've mentioned are not major and didn't overshadow the otherwise pleasant dining experience and tasty meal I had.",

    "text": "Not a lot of people know about Pusadee's Garden so I consider it somewhat of a hidden gem.  I've been to Pusadee's Garden many times, and it's my favorite thai restaurant in Pittsburgh.  You MUST make a reservation to sit in the garden.  I've dined at Pusadee's at least a dozen times and each time the garden is packed and for good reason--the food is great and the garden is beautiful.  This would be a good place to take a date or have a girls night out.  They are able to accomodate a party of 12 but it was a little bit cramped so I don't know if you'd want to go with a group larger than that.  Also, if you go with a large gorup of people you'll want to know that they cannot split the bill so bring cash!  The food at Pusadee's is consistently good.  I've had just about everything on the menu but my two favorite dishes are the Pumpkin Curry with Tofu and Street Noodle #1.  The pumpkin curry is balanced and sweet.  They use just enough coconut milk to balance the bite of the curry and the chunks of lightly grilled pineapple are great.  I get this with tofu and brown rice.  This curry dish is light on the vegetables, sometimes it seems like more of a soup and I'm guilty of slurping the curry from the bowl and I do not care if you judge me--this stuff is delicious!  ;)  The Street Noodle #1 sounds unimpressive on the menu but this is fantastic.  The tempura chicken is to die for.  I strongly recommend the crispy tofu appetizer, it's delicious and the tofu is prepared in a tempura style which I relaly like, a lot of other restaurants offer this dish and the tofu has been deep fried and is swimming in an oily sauce.  When you order food they'll give you a spice level from 1 - 10.  THE FOOD IS HEAVY ON THE HEAT!  Pick your spice level consdervatively!  I like spicy food but bc I wanted to share my curry w a friend who wasn't a fan of spicy food I ordered a 5 and it was so hot it brough tears to my eyes.  If you like a little bit of spice but are unsure, go wiht a spice level #4.  Trust me.  My friend ordered a spice level #5 and her meal was so hot she couldn't eat it.  :(  The service here is so-so.  It's going to take them a long time to come ot your table so I'd advise ordering everything at once.    Dont' come to Pusadee's if you are in a hurry, bc it takes a while for the kitchen to prepare your food but its worth the wait.  This place is BYOB.",

The crispy crab rolls and pork meatballs (grilled on sugar cane skewers) are my favorite appetizers, but everything's excellent. The vegetables are always fresh, they grow their own herbs, everything comes out piping hot, and when they're briefly in season, the soft-shell crabs are tremendously happy-making.

    "text": "(4 stars not 5 because I've only been here once and therefore can't vouch for everything on the menu.)  Came here for date night and the food. After reading reviews on other Thai places in Pittsburgh, I chose Pusadee's because it seemed the most suitable for a relaxing dinner after work with my boyfriend and for good thai food. We sat outside on the patio, which was really nice. Even though it looks like a small space, we didn't feel crowded in with the tables next to us. The wait staff was quick and attentive, but not overly attentive like at other restaurants where I'm often caught mid-bite into a spoonful of my meal when they decide to check in on my table and ask if I need anything.   Onto the food. I ordered the pumpkin curry with tofu and a thai iced tea. It was delicious! The thai iced tea was well prepared - it wasn't too sweet or overbearing like I've had at some other places. The curry had ample chunks of squash and firm tofu, and warmed me up when the temp dropped outside after the sun had set. One thing the restaurant could do to make the outdoor seating more bearable in late spring / early summer / late summer is add patio heating for the evenings when temps can still drop into the 60s or lower. Other than that, it was a pleasant treat to be seated outside!  All in all, I'd go to Pusadee's again. While the food didn't blow me away, it didn't disappoint either. I think it's a great option for thai food and a nice overall meal-out experience in Pittsburgh. (Western PA isn't exactly the prime geographic area for Asian food in the world anyways.)",
