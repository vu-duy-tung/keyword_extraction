We had drinks in the bar downstairs before dinner and I was shocked at how affordable the cocktails were.  A Manhattan was only $6.50!  And with that view...that's a bargain.  The smoked salmon appetizer was outstanding.  I ordered Parmesan crusted mahi mahi and asked the server if the chef would add capers to it.  They gladly accommodated my request, and I appreciated that!  My Dad had the lobster.  He said it was great.  I rarely order rice pilaf but much to my surprise it was delicious.  Service was great.  I will go back.  Our total tab before tip (for 2) was $132.",

Freshest of fish, one time I got the Halibut with a mandarin orange finish and it tasted really fresh and very well done. Most recently, I ordered the Mahi Mahi with cranberry sauce and it was also very well prepared and tasted awesome. Every time I stop by, the service is impeccable, i'm always surprised at how much the wait staff have memorized for the every changing menu. I definitely recommend ordering some side dishes, you can't go wrong with a few Oysters on a half shell to start and then some Lobster Mac & Cheese to compliment your meal. Finally, they have a great Dessert menu, twice now i've gotten the White Chocolate Macadamia Mousse, honestly there isn't much better you can do to finish off a wonderful meal. Big enough to share with 2 or 3 too.",

    "text": "We had family in to Pittsburgh for the very first time from Indiana. The trip was planned for months and being from Pittsburgh myself I wanted them to experience Mt Washington and the incredible view as well as what I believed would be one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. We were a party of 5 and made our reservation for Saturday night September 21st at 9pm in order to not be in the busiest time period. We arrived at 5 minutes to 9 and were rudely treated at first by the valet parking attendant as the entry to the valet parking area is actually very tight and very confusing. He literally shouted at us to \"back up\" and in general just made us feel like school kids!!.....well up in the elevator to the restaurant itself and indeed the views are spectacular....unfortunately that was the last \"spectacular\" item of the evening. After checking in at the host stand it took another 15 minutes before out table was ready??....and it was NOT busy at this stage and as above one of the reasons we made the later booking. After being seated it was at least another 10 minutes before anyone came to attend to us other than getting served ice water???....the waitress finally came to the table and gave us the menus and told us of the specials....took our cocktail orders and was off.....another 10 minutes passed and finally we were served 1 small bread basket with one small dish of butter....for 5 people??....still no cocktails but we placed an appetizer order and also our entree order as well as we were really hungry at this point.....well another 10 minutes passed and still no cocktails or appetizers.....we had devoured the small bread basket long ago so we asked another different waiter if we could get another basket and it seemed like we were asking for something way out of line???.....finally our waitress came back to our table (after we observed her across the room at another table chatting for at least 10 minutes) and asked about our cocktails which by now had been ordered about 20 minutes ago.....5 minutes later the cocktails arrived and 5 minutes after that the appetizers arrived....had oysters rockefeller which were cold and just very bland in general. Approximately another 15 minutes later our entrees arrived and as 3 in our group had ordered steaks we found that all 3 were NOT at anywhere near the requested level of temperature other than the one filet that had been requested as medium well and since it was butterflied it had been cooked to a piece of shoe leather!!!....the other 2 were to be medium and were basically what anyone would call very rare to rare at best....with the length of time it had taken just to get served we were not about to try and send anything back....the one Chilean Sea Bass entree was very good....the salmon entree was again cold, bland and just not what one would expect from a establishment with the reputation the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto was supposed to have....oh and the $12 tricolor roasted potatoes were also cold, bland and tasteless!!.....we ate what we could and left after a $400 bill with significant disappointment!!.....I know some will say why did you go to the \"Fish Grotto\" and order steaks but thats what our group chose and if it is on the menu and at the prices charged they also should be nothing short of excellent which they were NOT....having dined all over the Pittsburgh area for the last 35 years I can assure diners who are looking for a great dining experience that there are FAR BETTER choices than the MBFG.....unless you want to spend $80 per person (with NO wine) just for the chance of having a table with the great view I highly suggest you look elsewhere even on Mt Washington....as per the title simply not even close to \"The Standard\" expected and deserved.",

They heavily promote the fact that they fly all this fresh in from around the world, but it is so over-prepared with sauces and spices that you cannot enjoy the actual freshness of the fish.  Portions are moderate, but the prices are high. Most wines are at least $10 a glass. They do go out of their way to work with people who are gluten intolerant, including having tapioca rolls, but everything adds up very quickly.  In my opinion, you are paying for the view. For quite a bit less money you can enjoy much better food at nearby La Tavola.",

That is where things began to break down.  The wine service was disappointing for a Wine Spectator Award of Excellence restaurant.  I ordered a specific vintage of Pinot Noir and reiterated the year to the waitress. The wine steward brought the wrong vintage, very poor for such a highly rated restaurant.  She was able to find the right bottle after I pointed out the error to her, but I shouldn't have had to point it out.  I also ordered the fish special, which came at a premium price, but it arrived lukewarm.  Again, disappointing. The food and wine \"experience\" downgraded the overall evening and showed that you can't live on ambiance alone in the restaurant business.  It will make me think twice before dining at the Monterey Bay Fish Grotto again.",

    "text": "I had a wonderful evening, it was far more than I expected.  First I took the incline up from the Sheraton on Wednesday evening last week.  It was a short walk from the station.  I was pleasantly surprised to find upon entering I would be taking an elevator UP further to the restaurant the view from the elevator was even more spectacular than from the incline.  The place was busy but the hostess told me I could enjoy the same view and menu from the bar.  The view there did not disappoint, nor did the staff.  I found out about this place from the cab driver that drove me to the hotel from the airport, he raved about the crab cake being better than the ones in MD.  I did try the crab cake as an appetizer, it was very good, delicious, not as good as one from Faidleys but it was very good, quite tasty.  The bar staff was very receptive, very helpful in my wine selections.  I had a brut with my crab cake and a Murphy Goode sauvignon  blanc with a grilled salmon with their house remoulade and a side of broccollini.  It was perfect and the wine suited the meal.  Did I mention the view?  from my seat in the bar it was great.  I also want to comment that one of the staff, maybe a sommelier came down, popped open a bottle of wine and asked the bartender and wait staff to taste it, think about the flavors and he'd be back to discuss.  I really enjoyed listening to him and the staff interact and learn something they could share with a future customer about a bottle of wine.  Anyway, the staff was pleasant, view was magnificent and well worth the walk a mile down to the other incline to take me back to the Sheraton.  If I ever come back to downtown Pittsburgh, I will definitely stop and bring others up to this great place.",

After serving us, the waiter disappeared and my husband had to get up from the table to ask for a claw cracker.  The waiter returned quickly enough, full of apology.  Apparently, this establishment expects their patrons to dig the crab out of the legs with a dinner fork and knife.  While the waiter was well-versed on the selection of fish available, when he was asked the size of the stone crab claws, he replied \"a half pound\".   The standard answer at restaurants whose specialty is stone crabs is \"small, medium or large\"......FAIL.   The owner would be well-advised to clean the carpeting and find an air freshener that doesn't smell like stale socks.   On the upside, the view of the city is incomparable.  Wish the food and service was close.",

The food is excellent; Chilean sea bass and sea scallops have been some of the highlights. Of course the view is great, try to get a table by the front window.   However, the best part is the phenomenal desserts - the Steaming Chocolate Latte is possibly the best dessert I've ever had. This is a warm chocolate souffle in a big coffee mug topped with Chantilly cream and \"chocolate steam\" (wavy pieces of chocolate for decoration), and the execution is perfect. I've also tasted a number of the other desserts which were all great. It's worth it just for the dessert.  The only downside I can think of is the cheesy decor (especially the columns).",

    "text": "So, I find myself spending more and more time here lately since a friend recently moved into the apartments in the same building.  I've been going here for years and am definitely a a fan.  The valet parking is good, however a pet peeve is that you have to pay to valet.  I always think this should be complimentary with fine dining.  The elevator takes a fortnight to arrive to the top floor dining room is another small annoyance, but everything else is pretty close to five stars.  The main dining room is gorgeous with the best view of the burgh' or any city for that matter that you can have.  The hand painted palm trees are very nice and relaxing and the furniture is adequate.  They have plenty of space on the lower floor for big functions. I've had events in these big rooms for 50 to 100 folks multiple times.  However, a must visit is the wine room.  It is amazing.  You have three oak tables in a small room with wine bottles and floor to ceiling glass all around you.  Ask for Pat he is a great server and a True pro with respect to his craft.  He also always remembers me even though I haven't used the room for years.  They say the room seats 27 (3 tables of 9), but I don't suggest more than 24 in this space.  If you use this room you need at least 8 folks' and you have to choose one of the wine tasting menus.  They are $95 or $120 I believe for each 5 course wine tasting.  I suggest if you are going to use this room to splurge for the $120.  It's much better wine and includes a champagne toast.  This obviously is not a room I'd use often, but perfect for special occassions.  More and more I find myself simply sitting at the bar.  It has a great lounge and bar area, with plenty of seating.  If you find yourself in a bind to get a table in the dining room you can almost always find a table in the lounge with the same menu.  I've probably been here almost once a week the past couple months.  The bartenders are really good and definitely take care of there regulars.  As an aside, this place is also like the \"melrose place\" of Pittsburgh with many single folks choosing to stay in this building which has the restaurant located on the top floor.  The food is pretty much the best fish in Pittsburgh and less pricey than the some of the other fish joints like \"original fish market\".  My only complaint with the menu is that I wish they offered more shellfish options like crab and lobster and not just crab cakes (which btw are probably the best in the city, which is saying a lot for a town that loves crabcakes).   Some recent menu highlights have been the oysters rockefeller. I'd say skip this.  It was super heavy with a thick hollandaise, too much cheese and breadcrumbs.  The \"ahi\" tempura was really great and I found to be somewhat of a paradox in that it's close to raw great quality fish, but they find a way to put a light breading on it and deep fry it without the fish being overcooked.  My new favorite menu item.  The ichiban is good which is just a skewer of medium rare fish.  I also found the filet to be of great quality and reasonablyu priced for a \"prime\": cut for $37 for 10 oz.  You literally can't go wrong with any fish dish you choose, I'll just offer a couple suggestions.  If you want something rich and deeply flavored try the swordfish parmasan style.  It's very rich, but soooo delicious.  If you prefer something lighter with a lot of flavor try the Ahi Tuna sashimi style.  It's fantastic.  The prices are reasonable, service is good, and it's the perfect spot for out of town guests.  Definitely one of my Pgh. favs'.",

Our drinks were fantastic, and the seafood was heavenly. My party finished off the meal with Irish coffees, and they were so strong (whiskey wise) that he had to warn us as he set them down. My Irish nuts and berries ( a cream chamboard drink) was so strong it made my head spin (in a good way). Very expensive, but very much worth it.",

The staff was welcoming and professional, from the valet team to the hostesses to Thomas the wine manager to John the GM to Ann our server to everyone we observed during the busy 6:30pm Restaurant Week dinner rush. The main dining room is a visual treat, with the various levels of seating and the staff acting in total teamwork to deliver everything from water to wine to entrees and desserts without any noticeable territories - everyone pitched in for all the customers. What about the food, of course. From the amuse bouche through the desserts, the flavors and textures were wonderful, and the portions plenty - no need to fear micro servings here. (My one slight caveat is the New England clam chowder, which was just OK and in my opinion served at room temperature which is not quite right.) As everyone else on Yelp notes, this is likely not a restaurant to put in a regular rotation because it is more expensive than most, but we look forward to an occasion to return.",

I had them as an appetizer and a main! Anyone who goes here must try the crab cakes!   Overall, all their seafood is well done, but nothing you would crave for. The only two things I crave - the crab cakes and the butter served with the bread basket! And believe it or not, these are enough to keep me going back!  Service was good, as it should be for a fine dining restaurant.",

    "text": "Came here for a celebratory dinner last Friday night and it was so nice! The place has the best view (you take an elevator from the lobby to get to the actual restaurant/eating area).  We had our coats checked and were taken to a table right next to the window - the whole environment was very romantic and classy.    We had the combo appetizer (wasn't on the menu, but our waiter informed us about it).  It had one of the \"famous\" crab cakes (incredible), two ichiban skewers (salmon, yellow fin tuna, and swordfish), and two of their jumbo shrimp (sauce was delicious).   I had the salmon done the honey lime style and it was the best salmon I have ever had. It was so smooth and the honey was amazing.  My boyfriend ordered the yellow-fin tuna done port style.  The sauce was great but he found it to be a little too rare (but he is not too much of a tuna fan -- it would have been perfect for any other tuna lover).  We had the tri-color potatoes for a shareable side, the sweet potatoes were great, but found that we could have done without ordering the side.    We finished off with the chocolate cheesecake which was amazing.  I was worried that it would be too rich or sweet, but it was just the right amount and the texture was great.  The pretzel and pistachios were a great complement.    Overall, service, food, and environment made it a really memorable experience.  One thing that was a little hard to not mention was the constant refilling of our water glasses - I wouldn't even get 2 sips in until someone came over again to \"refill\" my glass!",

Sat in the lounge by the windows and enjoyed the views from dizzying height with addition of some dizzying cocktails.  Drink specialties are desserts in themselves, but got the Angel Food Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  Bruleed slices of angel food (torched for sure) with a schmear of sweetened cream cheese and served with vanilla ice cream fresh berries in a puddle of berry coulis, so, so, good.    Place has a little bit of a leftover 80s hangover vibe to it (Bladerunner-style ambient music, vibrant \"underwater\" graphic decor, zigzag martini glasses, Cyndi Lauper called and she wants her sweater back, she bop) even though the Pittsburgh location has only been open since 1996.  It's a lovely date night for first Match dates and dinner before the prom.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  It was a great way to end the night.",

You first pull up looks like your going into a hotel but it's just a lil lobby where they come out to valet your car. Then you get on an elevator to go up that is windowed so u can see the view outside,(was so not expecting that),  you walk in and give your reservation and then are seated. The restaurant is surround by windows. What a view. We wanted to be seat near the windows, however, there was no opening,  but it was fine we had a great lil booth and still had a good view of the city.  The food there  was amazing. I had sea bass and we also had a couple of appetizers. Which I was so caught up in my food and company and atmosphere I forgot to take pictures.. First date I didn't want to send back!.. Lol (you'd understand if you have read some of my other reviews.. Lol) Everything here was so good.  And the staff were nice and informative. If I am ever in Pittsburgh again I would definitely come back! But make sure you have $$$ cause it ain't cheap!",

We also got the Lobster Bisque which was good but a bit too thick for me. We ordered sushi with came out beautifully presented, it looked like a flower and it tasted great and fresh. I ordered the SeaBass and it was so good I didn't have any left.  My only one complaint is that we were there for awhile and were the second last table to leave  and my friend made a joke about something and our waitress made a rude comment back about how she deserved a glass of wine since she had to \"deal\" with us. Keep in mind we weren't loud or obnoxious we just stayed for awhile, which was too her benefit because we ate and drank the whole night so our bill was not cheap. Other than that we had a fantastic time and will definitely be back.  It's also a great spot for a date since it has a beautiful view of downtown!",

Sitting-arrangement-wise, if you have the downtown view window side, that's great.  The middle-of-the-room view is not as good.  So it's like 4 tables out of the entire restaurant get a perfect view, the rest are just \"ok\" view.  Overall, Altius has better table arrangement with like 75% getter a great view.  food-wise, we had their oysters before, it was great.  Ali-tuna comes in both starter size and dinner size.  We like their starter size better. (maybe a different chef the other day, maybe just a better fish(?))  They have some of the best fish in town, most of them are great.  Salmon, tuna, trout...   Crab cake was better than average. (sorry, the best goes to Philly's XIX Nineteen.) Scallops were great. recommended.  Sidenote, if you like sashimi fish and ok with them raw, get \"rare\" instead of \"medium-rare\" for their grilled fish.  A friend and I had a rare and medium-rare salmon side-by-side and we both agreed the \"rare\" one was better.  Their house special - Angel Food Grilled Cheese Sandwich is a must try.  (5/5), go for it.",

Our waiter was very professional and gave us dining recommendations.  We started off with a glass of wine. I had the signature crab cakes with a side of asparagus and red peppers. My girlfriend ordered the surf and turf. Both meals were exceptionally delicious. We had bread with our meal as well. Please note that everything here is ala carte and there is no Wi Fi. Valet parking is $6.00. There is no self parking.  Before I ordered dessert the waiter told me it was on the house and I ordered a while chocolate mousse with praline cookies. It came with a candle and two plates for us to share. It was very good. We sat at a table that overlooked the city and had pictures taken.  Our waiter did everything to make my birthday special.

We were able to get reservations at the last minute for 6:00 on a Friday night since we didn't think we were going to be in the city for dinner time. We were just coming from the Duquesne incline, and it's only a quick 5 minute walk from there. We noticed a lot of people were dressed up for dinner, while we had on casual clothes which was completely fine as we noticed later on as more people came in. They gave us a corner table right by the window, which completely surprised us since we didn't even think to ask and it gave us an amazing view of the city! The staff was very welcoming and helpful during our entire dinner! The food is delicious and they had a good kids menu to select from! We don't take our kids out to dinner often, but when we do they know it's a treat and they know how to behave! It is more of a fancy type of restaurant, so I would say if you have younger kids, only take them if they are well behaved. I highly recommend this restaurant when in the city!",

This is one of those places you go for a special occasion or if you have money oozing out of your pockets.  Situated on a hill overlooking downtown you won't find better views of the city.  While dining looking out the window it almost feels as if what you are looking at is a post card of a night time scene of Pittsburgh.  I included a picture that shows exactly what I was enjoying.  The service I experienced was impeccable.  Server knew everything about the menu and helped with the meal selection as well as the wine.  The maitre de also made sure that I was having a great time as well.  That's always a plus in my book when someone in charge performs table touching helping patrons enjoy their time.  The food was very good, but not the greatest.  I didn't fall in love with what I had and this is the reason I can't give this restaurant five stars.  While dining at this type of fine dining place the food should be near the top of what you have had before.  I'm not saying the food is bad at all, just could be a little better.  Overall I have to say the prices aren't that bad and the view is absolutely spectacular.  I think this is a great choice for anyone looking for that dinner that will \"wow\" them while visiting Pittsburgh!  And if you live here, it's one of those places you go every so many years.",

    "text": "Many times I have thought to myself... if only I had more disposable income so I could come here more often. Not many restaurants have inspired this line of thinking in me, Monterey Bay being an obvious exception.   The absolute freshest and best prepared fish/seafood in the Pittsburgh area hands down. Also, do yourself a favor and get the white chocolate, macadamia nut dessert thing. It's life changing.  A few note-worthy observations... 1) Reservations strongly recommended, use the same name every time you come [reasons/explanation below in 2, 3] 2) I noticed a strong correlation between number of attendances and preferable seating. While it's simply a theory, I would venture to guess this hypothesis could be proven. The first time I came here we were placed in the most remote corner from the best views... with each time we came back we noticed that we got closer and closer to the best seating in the house (near the 3-rivers view).  3) Client profile? During one return visit, we were discussing wine selection and couldn't remember what we had chosen last time. The bottle was so good, we wanted to indulge again but couldn't remember what it was. Much to my surprise, a profile had been created under our reservation name and every wine bottle selection we had previously made was documented and recorded in a 'client profile' so to speak. This kind of service is unprecedented. I was somewhat in shock. 4) After frequenting Monterey so much, the manager had somewhat come to know me and my husband a bit. He didn't remember our names necessarily, but remembered our faces and previous conversations we had. As a result, we were granted dessert on the house while dining in celebration of my engagement.",

    "text": "As a disclaimer:  I never, ever, ever write reviews.  However, this place gave me the inclination  to make a Yelp account so I could do so.   My boyfriend and I were in Pittsburgh just for fun, as we live a few hours away and just wanted to explore.   I looked at restaurants that would give us a nice view of Pittsburgh, and this place came up.  I believe when I made the reservation it said to ask for a view when I got there.  But I didn't need to. The hostess took us to a corner table with an incredible view of the city.  It was then I knew this dinner was going to kick ass.  The smell of seafood on the way to our table was more intoxicating than we had planned on getting that evening.  We started off with a succulent bottle of Amarone.  Most of their wine list are wines from the U.S., but I personally like to get down with the Italians.  Our appetizers were oysters on the half shell and seared Kobe; which the only complaint that I have is that they didn't just keep bringing to the table until we told them to stop.  Then we split the crab soup, which my boyfriend and I harassed our server about getting us the recipe because it was- The. Best. Soup. Ever.  For our entrees he had rockfish prepared the Thai peanut way and I had Caribbean Sea Bass. Both of us took the first bite and our legs went numb.  It was that weird erotic satisfaction only perfectly prepared delicious food can give you - that almost sexual satisfaction where nothing in the world matters except for the next bite, which you are almost afraid to have because you don't want the food to go away.  Both of us were fat and happy by the end of this, but we couldn't stop there. Dessert?  When in Rome... Or something.  Why can't they have a sampler of all of the desserts?  Sighhhhhh... Oh well.  We decided on sharing the Banana Foster cheesecake. Holy Moses was it delicious.  It made you forget about all the other food you just stuffed in your belly and focus on the magical piece of cheesecake in front of you. Neither of us could remember a more satisfying meal.  Maybe we both have the same taste in food, but it ruined the rest of our night because although the night had just begun, nothing was going to top this meal.  As for the service, I believe our server's name was Jane.  She was incredibly appropriate and wonderful.  She was knowledgeable not just about the menu, but about Pittsburgh itself, and really just was perfectly pleasant in every way. The entire staff seemed happy and like they wanted to be there.    Thanks Monterey Bay!",

All I can say is WOW and if you go you absolutely MUST order the crab cake. This is seriously in the top two crab cakes that I've had in my life.  We also had the eggplant rolletini and calamari appetizers which we shared and both were excellent. A few others had The salmon as their entrees and one had the she crab soup. The desserts were equally spectacular as their savory counterparts. The choices were the angel food grilled cheese sandwich and The dark chocolate truffle cake. No one was disappointed by the end of lunch and everyone left full and happy. They also have a very nice wine list. The view from the party room was spectacular and the wait staff were very happy and attentive. The overall decor if the restaurant is still reminiscent of when it was Christopher's back in the day and that is honestly the only criticism that I have is that the decor is a bit outdated.",

The first thing to note is that the view is the #1 reason to come (especially if from out of town like us).  It is perched on the hill overlooking the city and after dark, it is nice to look down on the city.    Unfortunately, the restaurant decor itself is fairly outdated, but to be honest the view dominates so much that we did not notice.  Service was consistent and attentive.  The wine list was nice but overpriced.  The food unfortunately is what got this place 3 stars.  While the fish was definitely fresh (they claim flown in daily), the preparations that were ordered at my table just didnt work.  Some of them (mahi mahi) were too sweet, some too buttery, some to nutty, etc.  They didnt highlight the fish as much as they could have and tended to overpower the fish.  All in all this was a nice spot for dinner especially for people from out of town due to the view.",

Also, our server was phenomenal, I just wish the food was a little bit better.   This place is great for the view though.  I suggest if it's a busy night reservation wise, try to get a table down at the bar, as the view is just as great down there and less unobstructed.",

The decor is just cheesy and lame. Fake painted palm trees?   Service? Not what I would expect for a restaurant that runs at minimum $50+ per person. You have to pay for valet parking. When I arrived at the restaurant the valets did not even walk up to my car and open the door, or my passenger door. I had a reservation and still had to wait 10 minutes to be seated at an empty restaurant. (lets not forget about the elevator ride).   Food? I have had better seafood from Costco. They serve FARMED salmon. What kind of seafood restaurant does that? The crabcakes are the only thing that is good on the menu. Everything else is just terrible. I ordered a special earlier this year that included three items: Filet, Duck, and Yellow-fin tuna. I ordered the meat and duck medium rare and tuna rare. When the server brought out my meal, the duck and meat were barely cooked to \"rare\" temperatures. They were could throughout. I will happily eat rare meat, but rare duck is awful. I asked the server if she could have them cook the duck and meat a little longer (to medium rare temps). She argued with me that I was wrong and shouldn't be doing that. She took my food and brought it back. The meat and duck were even colder than they were the first time.   $150 later, I left the restaurant frustrated and disappointed.",

    "text": "Full Disclosure (We were the guests of my fiances employers i.e., didn't pay)  As for the decor, we were seated in a private room with a lot of floor length windows looking out at the wonderful view so I wasn't really paying attention to what some refer as outdated decor.   We started off with a drink at the bar he had a rum and coke (very strong!) and I had a very well balanced cosmopolitan made with fresh lime juice (huge plus over the bottled stuff)  They had set up a menu for us with a salad, choice of entree and shared dessert platter.   Even though the bread looked like just the take and bake variety they were wonderful (someone at our table even wanted to steal the bread basket from the other table to get more)  The salad was excellent and had a passion fruit dressing that I would love to buy and use everyday on my salads.   For my entree I had the grilled swordfish oscar style (crab meat, asparagus, and hollindaise (spelling?))  this was excellent, there was just enough hollindaise to add richness, but not to much that it was swimming in it.  The fish was also cooked perfectly.     My fiance had the tuna seared rare with some type of sesame sauce that was out of this world.  I am not a huge fan of tuna and I stole two pieces :).   The portion sizes were outrageous.  I can't speak for the everyday portions, but these were more than generous.   The dessert platter had key lime tarts, mini cheesecakes, truffles, and a chocolate mouse.   I tried the key lime tart good, but a bit to sweet and the chocolate truffle which was just the perfect size and sweet bite to end the meal.   Now being on the budget we are on and saving for a wedding, this place is not one I expected to be able to try for a long time, but the food was wonderful and I am glad we had the chance to enjoy it!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had dinner at Monterey Bay to celebrate his birthday during a recent visit to Pittsburgh.  First, the view is truly outstanding.  The place is quite pricey, and it's clear that the view is a big part of what you're paying for and arguably worth it.  The service was very good, and the food that we ordered ranged from so-so to excellent.  The appetizer of lobster rangoons was our most disappointing dish.  The portion was very small; the presence of lobster inside was barely discernible; and it simply wasn't especially tasty or memorable for the price.  We also shared a caesar salad to start, which was fine, typical of any caesar salad.  It was nice that they pre-divided the salad onto two plates to make it easier for us to share.  For our entrees, my boyfriend chose the coq au vin, and I ordered the parmesan rockfish.  All of the entrees are served a la carte, so we also ordered a side of the gratin potatoes to share.  My rockfish was excellent, with a simple, flavorful, and unfussy preparation to showcase the fish nicely.  The potato gratin side dish was also very tasty.  My boyfriend was disappointed in the coq au vin, though.  Although the portion of chicken was generous, he ultimately found the preparation to be a bit too minimalist.  Traditional coq au vin is typically a hearty, rustic, comforting dish with a lot of richly flavored broth and vegetables -- the kind of dish that you want to dip your bread in to soak up all the extra goodness.  The preparation here, though, had almost no broth and, in turn, minimal flavor.  We also found the wine list a little disappointing.  There were a number of wines that were priced quite high yet are pretty common and easy to find elsewhere -- and thus we know how inexpensive they typically are when purchased at a store versus in an expensive restaurant.  If you're going to charge a high mark-up on wine (as all restaurants do, so that's to be expected), it would be nice to focus on providing interesting and special offerings that one might not be as familiar with and which aren't easily found at many other stores and restaurants.  Having said that, we eventually settled on one of the few white wine options that was both interesting and reasonably-priced, the Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc-Viognier blend, which turned out to be pretty enjoyable -- offer more wines like this, please!  At the end of our meal, the restaurant very generously brought my boyfriend a complimentary dessert of his choice in honor of his birthday.  He opted for the angel food cake grilled cheese sandwich, which was unique and decadent and quite delicious.  Overall, we had a very nice experience here.  It would be nice to see a little more variety on the wine list, and it would be even better if all of the dishes were equally satisfying and flavorful.  However, the view is outstanding, as are the service and the atmosphere.  It's definitely a nice place to celebrate a special occasion.",

    "text": "Monterey Bay is somewhere that I keeping come back to. My family has been coming here for years and their standard of food has not got down.  We always start with the appetizer trio. It is not listed on the menu, but is a great combination of blackened shrimp with a sweet chutney, an ichiban skewer of swordfish, salmon, tuna and a jumbo lump crab cake. Their crab cake is hands down probably the best in the burgh. There is jumbo lump crab in every bite and the aioli with it complements it so well. The skewer was also perfectly cooked and is in an ancho chili aioli.   For dinner, I had the lobster stuffed with jumbo lump crab, spinach, and a Madeira sauce. The lobster was perfectly cooked and tastes great with the sauce. Probably did not need the crab. My dad got the Chilean sea bass prepared tropical curry style. The mango salsa was delicious with the fish. He also had the potato au gratin and loved it. A side dish definitely shareable for two.   Finally, for dessert I had the peach cobbler cheesecake. The cheesecake was delicious but the topping was a little thick. Also, they lit a candle for my birthday and the desert was on the house which was nice.   Overall, I give this place five stars because of the countless times we have come and had delicious food and service. Also you really can't beat the view!",

    "text": "Quite honestly the best restaurant experience I've had in a looong time. EVERYTHING about our night was absolutely perfect! I'll start by saying that Pittsburgh's food scene has been exploding as of late with lots of new trendy spots popping up in hipster neighborhoods around town. But Monterey Bay has been a standard in the Burgh for a long time, and I feel like it's only gotten better. Some of the restaurants on Mt. Washington coast by on the views, but that's not the case here!  The views are excellent of course, and the decor is contemporary but still inviting. I think the last time I was here they had a tropical theme going on, but the remodeled interior is beautiful.  We had the ceviche appetizer - I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. It was light and refreshing, and we could tell that the kanpachi was fresh. I had the crab cake and scallops as my entree. The scallops were simply prepared but SO good. If you come here you need to experience a crab cake! They use practically no filler at all. Just enough to keep it together. They are also broiled instead of fried. I honestly don't know if i would ever order anything else here!   My fiance went with the shrimp tagliatelle which was also fabulous. The sauce was delicious and the tagliatelle noodles were cooked perfectly. We were surprised that the pasta dish was so delicious! For dessert we went with the angel food grilled cheese and the hype is real - it's amazing. The portion size was quite large so I think this is perfect to share. I love dessert and this is one of my favorites.  The service was just excellent. Jane our server was so friendly and knowledgeable and the manager stopped by to check on us as well. I can't wait to come back!!",

    "text": "The food was delicious. Our waiter was fantastic.   What confused us was the ambiguous policy on seating supposedly being first come first serve for the seats closer to the windows to observe the lovely views.   We were told when we made reservations that seating was first come first serve. We arrived at the restaurant to be told that if we would have come early and waited, we could get better seating. Then we sat down and observed about 3 tables with great views that were empty. We then kindly asked to sit closer to the windows, at which they said, ohhh we didn't see those seats open?!  I would consider going back, but disappointed with seating as there is clearly 'no policy'. I think they decide based who you are and how you arrive as to what seat you are getting. And I would be remiss to state that we were FAR better dressed with jackets and fine clothes than many other diners.",

The service was attentive and not overbearing, fairly knowledgeable, friendly, and it's a white cloth sort of place, albeit not stuck up.  I give it a four star simply because I think it's rather overpriced.    Onto the food:   - Beef carpaccio with a dash of truffle oil:  Solid but nothing to write home about.  Truffle oil isn't too overwhelming.   - Lobster bisque:  Beautifully done classic.  No complaints here.  - Whole fish with olives and other veggies:  Mine was black bass and it was delicious, just barely cooked, lightly seasoned.   - Redfish curry:  Pretty light on the curry and not really a Thai or Indian or Japanese or any traditional curry, but tasty.  - Angel food cake grilled cheese:  Yes, it sounds bizarre, but my dining companions said it was the star of the desserts.   - Chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse dessert:  My dining companions said these were quite good.    For drinks, the smoke Manhattan was more like a decent traditional Manhattan.",

    "text": "As a born and raised Pittsburgher, it's astonishing that this was only my 2nd time visiting Monterey Bay. Monterey Bay is an old staple, and has been around for a long time, and it sometimes gets overlooked with all of the new and trendy restaurants in Pittsburgh now. It did not disappoint. Even though I live on Mt. Washington, there's something special about taking the elevator up to the restaurant while observing the city.   Dinner starts with a delicious selection of bread and a homemade butter. We started with the Kanpachi Seviche. I was shocked at how tasty it was, especially for someone who is a pretty picky seafood eater. One thing to note, this starter has a little kick to it with the jalapenos, but you can easily eat around those if you don't like them.  For my entree, I ordered the Brandied Shrimp Tagliatelle. Delicious sauce, pasta cooked perfectly, and more than enough shrimp. If this is your first visit, you must try their crab cakes as that's their specialty. I was lucky enough to have a taste of my fiance's.   In addition to delicious food, restaurants that provide top notch service always stand out. Our server, Jane, was amazing. The GM stopped at our table to make sure everything was okay, and that is much appreciated.   We shared the angel food grilled cheese dessert. Great way to end the meal. Must visit in Pittsburgh.",

This show is spectacular (and we have seen a lot!).  The restaurant itself is beautiful aside from the view.  The food, however, while very good is not at the level this room and view deserve.  One of us had (expensive) sole that was undercooked in the center, and another in our party had a pasta dish that came out cold (and had to be reheated but then didn't get returned until after everyone else had eaten).  The \"famous\" dessert called angel food cheese sandwich or something was an overly sweet, rather gooey and unsophisticated creation that I ordered to see what it was and wished I hadn't.  The side dishes are only available for the table and much too huge and an unnecessary additional expense.  So go (once) . . . and enjoy . . . but order simply and don't expect truly haute cuisine.  It is very good, but it's the view that gives this review its 4th star.  Expensive.  There is a large bar/informal dining room on the level below the top story formal dining room, which may allow better value with the same views.  They did not ever offer this option to us.  Their problem may simply be the difficulty of trying to serve high level food to too many patrons at once.",

Anyway I thought it was important I share my recent experience as it was so good and figured people would like to hear about it. This evening we celebrated my in-laws 50th Wedding anniversary. It was a surprise event with 10 of their closest family/friends. The staff at Monterey Bay not only helped us pull of the surprise but they made the entire experience enjoyable for everyone . Every staff member went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. We received all of our food quickly... no water glass was ever empty and they checked in on use every so often. Monterey Bay has the freshest seafood in Pittsburgh and everyone enjoyed their meal. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking to celebrate a special occasion or if you're just looking for the best seafood in Pittsburgh. I definitely recommend this restaurant !",

An old college roommate was in town shooting a video for a client, and our other roommate had recently moved back to the Burgh from DC, so I planned to come in for the weekend. Both friends are new mothers, and a dinner out- let alone with old pals- was a rare treat.   I called the restaurant and let the host know of our special occasion. I feel like the host must have tweeted it or something, because from the moment we walked in, we were treated like gold. A manager even stopped by and ensured we were being taken care of!   A great table with a spectacular view, attentive service (including accommodating my friend's dairy restrictions without missing a beat), and fantastic food. We shared an appetizer that came with roasted shrimp, a fish kebab, and a crabcake. Those crabcakes, damn! For my entree, I had the ahi tuna- it was fresh and buttery soft, yes!  We lingered and laughed and told tawdry tales and no one rushed us out. Our server even told us usually tables of women aren't her favorite but we were a joy to serve. We left smiling ear to ear. Bravo, Monterey Bay!",

When we arrived on a Monday night, there were plenty of window seats available to take advantage of the awesome city view!  Our waitress greeted us immediately with a kind and courteous demeanor.  Since it was my hubs birthday, I ordered him Oysters on the half shell, which he devoured. He also chased them with a Mojito. For our entrees, we ordered the Swordfish, which was tender, moist and devine. We also ordered the Jumbo Sea Scallops, which were okay, but we prefer them grilled. We ordered the Jumbo Shrimp that was stuffed with the signature crab cake, along with the shareable Lobster and Crab Mac & Cheese. Of all the entrees, we both really enjoyed the Swordfish the most.  The Lobster and Crab Mac & Cheese was decadent, full of cream and not enough cheese in my opinion, but good nonetheless.  Overall, the dinner was good, the view was spectacular, and the price is high as usual! I thought that I heard they didn't have the angel food grilled cheese sandwich dessert and I really wanted to try it, but other than that we really enjoyed the evening.",

    "text": "This is a great place for the view, the romantic ambiance, and the service.  The food, unfortunately, is hit-or-miss - especially considering the price.  We had a reservation at 9:30 on a busy night.  Fortunately, the dining rush was dying down by then and we were quickly seated by a corner table (tables on the northeast side will get you a better view of the Pittsburgh skyline).  The waiters were friendly and courteous, and the manager came out to deliver our wine selection.  True to the restaurant's name, the menu featured a copious selection of fish.  (I'm pretty sure that being at the top of a tall building on top of a hill overlooking a city is the opposite of being a grotto, though.)  We started with a sampler of various appetizers that included shrimp, crab cakes, and a fish skewer.  These all had great flavor and texture and paired well with their respective sauces.  I had the whole bronzini classically prepared with tomatoes, onions, capers, and olives.  The kitchen delivered a solid performance on this one - crispy skin with tender flesh and a good balance of flavors.  I managed to sneak a few bites of my date's lemon sole, which was unfortunately overdone and in want of a sauce.  If you don't mind eating whole fish, that's what I would recommend - it's much harder to screw up the preparation.  We shared the chai tea cake for dessert, which was also perfectly acceptable.  There were many interesting choices available, though, and we had a hard time deciding.  Moral of the story - this is a great place for a fancier date or night out, but don't expect amazing food.  Oh, and the wine list is fairly extensive and expensive, even by fancy restaurant mark-up standards.",

The view, service and food were all exceptional.  My waiter, Mark, was friendly and helpful.  I was dressed in jeans and work boots, but that didn't seem to matter (maybe to the other patrons who were dressed in suits it did).  I was told to expect high prices by a business associate, so I was prepared for the sticker shock. I had an appetizer sampler platter of a crab cake, sword fish, seared tuna, and salmon, cooked to perfection and just the right balance of a glazed sauce.  The crab cake was not like a traditional crab cake, with more \"cake\" (filling) than crab. Hard to find ANY filling as it was mainly crab.  Best that I have had.  The presentation of the appetizers and main meal (scallops) was also perfect.   You should figure spending close to $100 per person for an appetizer, meal, drink and tip.  If it comes in less than that, consider yourself lucky.  Personally, I thought it was worth every penny.",

I was entertaining guests from  Europe and the were impressed by the ambiance.  They have a diverse selection of fish flown in daily from various parts of the world, but mainly from the US.  One guest had the sea food bisque served over lump crab meat as a starter.  He indicated that it was good.  The other individual had the calamari which he enjoyed and I had the spinach salad.  For our main course one of my guests had the halibut, and my other guest and I had the crab cakes.  The waitress indicated that the crab cakes were a specialty.  They were very good, just enough breading to call them cakes barely holding together the jumbo lump crab.  They sat in a delicious sauce that was lightly applied to the plate.  Excellent warm bread was served with meal.  I am not a wine expert, but the list while not extensive seemed to span the range of wines appropriate for the menu and various budgets.  We had a chardonnay from the Columbia River Valley.  It was nice.  Often restaurants with great views have so so food.  That is not the case here.  It is a great place for a special event or to entertain business associates.",

    "text": "The first time I went to Monterey Bay, the only thing I remembered was the view. The second time I went, my salad had a hair in it. The third time, I was so displeased with my overall experience that I felt compelled to write something.  I usually don't complain about service or food but to be treated the way I was on all levels is disrespectful. I understand you're trying to maintain a reputation on par with the other establishments along Grandview Avenue, but you're failing, Monterey Bay. On multiple levels.  I've never made reservations for the dining room. Why should you when the bar downstairs is more romantic and almost always guarantees a view of the city? If you do ever venture to Monterey Bay, keep that in mind.  I, along with two other people, saddled up to the bar and patiently waited for a table to become available. Naturally, we wanted a drink while we waited. That wouldn't have been a problem if our bartender didn't act like we didn't exist. Ok, Mr. Bartender, I get you are busy but the rudeness and unwelcoming environment you created is truly unnecessary. While I may look young, my money is just as good as everyone surrounding me. And actually you should be catering to me since I'm at an age where I have a \"disposable income\" to waste on things like a tip. You might have known that if you taken the time to ask me anything other than \"drink?\"  We almost left after that. Unfortunately, a table opened up.  Fifteen minutes after we sat at our table filled with dishes and glasses, I finally waved someone over. He apologized and cleared the table and sent our waitress over. Have you ever been scolded at a fine dining establishment? I have. It was really... interesting. Our waitress asked if we planned on eating, if we payed our bar tab, and a myriad of other questions you might ask a group of teenagers looking to dine-and-dash.  She then proceeded to ignore us in favor of her 3 other tables (One was a couple celebrating their anniversary, one was a couple waiting for a table upstairs and the other was a family). She didn't make any recommendations, she barely engaged in conversation, and she gave us different dinnerware than everyone else. The last one is not a big deal but I notice these things.  When our food came out it was cold. Not even under a heat lamp cold. It was just cold. And fish is not very tasty cold. My scallops were gritty and missing ingredients listed on the menu. And for the price, I expected my knife to melt through the scallop like it was hot butter. But I guess sawing through a scallop is ok too.  It's a real shame I won't ever be going back to Monterey Bay because that snack mix they had at the bar was seriously amazing.",

That start positive and view is amazing but so what,  I am here to eat and not take $200 photos.  Let's start with service.  All nice but clearly not managed and trained well.  Forgot bread, did not show us the wine before pouring, clumsily dripped it on each refill.  Came in on wrong side with nearly everything crossing your face with his arm.  Ok to the fish.  Preparations are 1980s with heavy sauces, lots of \"crusts\" and side from an old steak house.  Assuming it is fresh, I want to taste the fish and not the sauce.  Seems like they are hiding it.  It would also help to know the fish.  Description of rock fish was like a red snapper, flaky but with meatier taste.  Wrong.  It is super dense like a swordfish so the preparation he raved about make it too heavy.  Apps were also average and uninspired.  Soup was ok but it is soup.  For over $100 per person in Pittsburgh it should be better.  This place is resting on its laurels and needs a total refresh.  With all the creative new Food coming to our town... this place is a pass and spend your date night enjoying something you will remember.",

Now the service was very good, what I would expect for fine dining, the decor felt like a throwback to the 80s, the place needs a serious remodel, I notice these things being a contractor. The food is average and way way way overpriced! First I ordered oysters on the half shell, there where 6 oysters literally the size of a dime for $18, next came the lobster bisque, it was good, I've had much better for half the price, then came the scallops on a bed of gtits and some fried okra which was a signature dish of the chef, I could have swore the waiter said there was 6 that came with the meal, it came out with 4  for $38, are you kidding me? I assume because of the view of Pittsburgh it allows them to seriously overcharge for everything.    I love eating fine dining and I expect to pay for the experience, service and atmosphere that comes with fine dining, but I also expect outstanding food and reasonable portions, this was very average and terribly small portions for the price, oh and I forgot about the really bad and very small cup of coffee at the end of the meal that had obviously been sitting for awhile, $3 for 1 cup, folks there are much better fine dining restaurants around town than this one, although the view is still killer here.",

This is one of the best locations, if not simply the best, for a restaurant in Pittsburgh, and if you are lucky to be close enough from a window (as we were), you will impress your dinner guests! Now, not all tables are close to the windows, and some tables don't benefit from the view at all. I wonder how people are assigned to tables.  The food is based on fish, and the menu is impressive, with a beautiful list of fish. We had various fish dishes, but the clear winner was the sea bass (with pineapple - usually I am not a fan of pineapple in my food, but this dish was very successful). The other fish were good, but not nearly as tasty. Some were a bit bland. The risotto was good, the lobster mac and cheese not impressive.  The desserts are decadent - in a good and bad way. They are really very sweet and heavy, too much for the taste of our table. I'd recommend to share a few (we had 3 for 5, and this was too much, including angel food grilled cheese sandwich and macadamia mousse).   Overall, the food was decent, but the prices - very high for Pittsburgh - call for something better and more interesting. Too many fish dishes were good, but a bit bland.  Finally, our waiter was terrible. She pushed to consumption, insisting that we take some appetizers; she lost track of our bottle, and pretended it was empty, while we had only drank half of it; she put water on one of us...",

If you want a view, come here, but if you want great fish, I'd recommend other places, such as Casbah, Park Bruges, or Umi.  At Monterey Bay, I had the trout almondine, which they promised to be lightly sauteed, but I found it to be overcooked and heavy with butter that left an oily aftertaste in my mouth. The caesar salad and dessert I shared were good but not great. When this place wins best seafood and similar awards, it's not for the food, but for the view.  Our meals were about $53 per person including tip, but without drinks.",

The aesthetic here now is much more modern and reflective of the high end dining experience you get here. As I'm sure you already know, don't dine here unless you're prepared to pay at least $50 per person. Entrees here vary in cost, but average probably around $35. There are also a variety of appetizers, soups, salads and side dishes, as well as alcohol and dessert. It adds up very quickly. I had the Lobster Bisque soup as a starter. The server brought the bowl to me, with the lump lobster inside and then poured the soup overtop into the bowl in front of me. It was a really nice and flavorful soup with a considerable amount of lobster meat. For dinner, I had the Crab Cakes. The cakes were very generous in size and had more meat than filler. I would definitely recommend them just like many other Yelpers here have. I also got to try the lobster mac and cheese. This was also delicious. It is on the sides menu, but was big enough to have as an Entree.",

Grilled angel food sandwich dessert delicious. Butter they serve with bread was the favorite item of some in our party (in a seafood restaurant...should be the seafood, no?) Ahi tuna dish apparently not as good as it has always been. Even the famed crab cakes weren't getting rave reviews at our table.

Both times were very good--food was good, service excellent, and obviously the views are spectacular.  I read the comments about the outdated decor and agree, but I don't find that a major detraction, and really, it's all about the views, anyway.    The crowd on the Friday night I went for dinner included a lot of very well-dressed older men and very pretty younger women, people obviously on their first dates, to couple who looked like they had been married for 60 years.  It was pretty good people watching.      I wavered on 3 or 4 stars only because right now I don't go out of my way to visit there--which is what I typically have to do at minimum to give something 4 stars.  As I was sitting here writing, though, it occurred to me that I SHOULD be going there more often with out-of-town guests--it is probably the best thing I've seen up on Mt. Washington, though I haven't been to Isabella's yet (and know it always gets pretty good reviews, too).  And that is a great way to enjoy one of the most livable cities in the world!",

After coming here with the family to celebrate my brother's college graduation, I came away extremely pleased with the quality of the food, the service, and the overall experience.  Really terrific all around.  Everything I had that night tasted terrific and was presented beautifully.  My spicy tomato soup with crab had just the right amount of heat, complemented by a good amount of tender crab.  The seafood sampler allowed us to taste their savory crabcake, jumbo shrimp, and ichiban.   I also very much enjoyed my Chilean Sea Bass carribean style (with pineapple, jamaican jerk spices, and peppers), and the white chocolate mousse dessert was terrific.  My only complaint is that despite the exceptional flavor the food, the menu does not seem to be terribly inventive or original.  Yes, there are good dishes and drinks and everything looks and tastes amazing, but the fare here is by no means unique.  It doesn't seem terribly out of place at any other upscale restaurant, banquet hall, or steakhouse.  Otherwise, it's definitely a great place to go for that special occasion, and also when you want dinner with a view.",

I appreciated how the staff was not only welcoming, but knowledgeable and experienced with the establishment. Our cocktails-- Sneaky Tiki, Mount Remy, and the Old Fashioned were all expertly mixed and visually attractive. I had the Norwegian salmon special with dill cream sauce & and I loved it. My girlfriend had the crab cakes with broiled scallops. The restaurant boasts of their special crab cakes on the menu & through the waitstaff, and with reason-- they were awesome. Our friends had the Red Snapper and Chilean Sea Bass. All of their fresh fish dishes come with choices of how they can be prepared.

Diante (sp?) was our server and he was fantastic the whole night!    We started off with the appetizer trio, which included 1 lump crabmeat, a skewer of tuna, salmon and swordfish and a couple shrimp.  Everything was so succulant and delicious!  For our 2nd course, we both had a salad with fresh bread and a specially made whipped butter.  He had a caesar and I had a house salad, both very good!!  For our main course, we both ordered the Surf n Turf, which consisted of 6oz filet and 6oz lobster tail stuffed with a lobster cake.  Let me just say that the filet and lobster were the best I have ever had.  Filet was cooked perfectly as was the lobster.  Also, there was broccolini with hollandaise sauce.  The only thing I would have change would be for the broccolini to be cooked more.  It was a little hard, even to cut with a steak knife.

Then we took the elevator ride up, with an open view. But there is only one small elevator, which is very slow. We were there to celebrate a graduation dinner, and we had a nice time. The food is very expensive, but delicious! The sides are large and serve 2-4 people. I highly recommend the lobster Mac n cheese and the Kanpavhi Seviche. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with Chimichurri and it was really good. It didn't wow me, but it was definitely very good. I took a bite of the Brandied Tagliatelle with chicken instead of the shrimp, which was fantastic. However, there was too much fatty pieces of chicken in the dish. Also, I don't usually like crab cakes but my boyfriend ordered it and it was actually delicious! I think I ate too much bread and butter before my dinner because the butter was some of the best butter I have had... it was sweet and flavorful. Overall, we had a wonderful dinner and I highly recommend Monterrey Bay for any special occasion. Afterwards, the valet was super nice and willingly took a few photos for us outside.",

Great service, was seated promptly upon arrival and got the perfect window seat and a table to myself. Beautiful view of the river and city skyline! Classy, romantic atmosphere- highly recommend this for a date or special occasion. Tried the crab cake which they're known for, per waiters recommendation and was not dissappointed- it was broiled, and made up of real juicy chunks of crab. The sauce complemented it well. For my cocktail I ordered the pepino diablo, jalapeno infused tequila with cilantro cucumber and lime juice- slightly spicy and delicious! Also waiters recommendation (he has good taste). For dessert ordered the chocolate latte, chocolate flourless cake with cinnamon and chocolate steam. Would love to come back here!",

Monterrey bay is the real deal and certainly a 5 star restaurant. The crab bisque is the best I've ever had. All the seafood is fresh, and the staff is incredible and very attentive. They will even allow you to bring your own bottle of wine for a small cork fee rather than ordering one from the menu. One of my favorite things is riding the elevator up to the top because it is glass and you get a great view of the city! If you haven't checked out Monterrey bay yet, it's a MUST!",

Reservations can be made on Open Table or by calling in.  Drinks: the cocktails were delicious, my only complaint was there was a TON of ice and very little alcohol in the glass.  The wine selections were wonderful as well.  Appetizers: the appetizers to order are the crab cake. The crab cake is all crab and very little filler, such a wonderful and the most perfect crab cake there ever was. I loved the calamari, so crispy and served with pickled jalapenos on top, ohhh so good. The ichiba fish sampler blew my mind with the sauce seasoning. Caesar salad was served with real anchovies and perfect with the fresh cracked pepper.  Dinner: the special, the lobster ravioli was okay, pretty good but nothing memorable in my mind. Prepare to be blown away by the most tender flavorful stuffed scallops you will ever have.  Probably one of my favorite meals of the year.  Dessert: don't go home without having the best dessert in Pittsburgh (or your life). The grilled cheese angel food cake. Mind boggling and jaw dropping, not too sweet but the greatest array of flavors you will devour. The chocolate latte cake was pretty incredible as well. Heads up that it is really really hard to share these, don't underestimate these desserts.",

My date inquired about a substitution and the server was very accommodating. Not only that but a manager also followed up and made an additional recommendation. The brandied shrimp with tagliatelle and cream sauce is the best pasta dish I have ever had. The cream is light, well-balanced and vey flavorful. The shrimp is prepared butterflied and there is a generous portion. The pasta is served al dente (of course) but is also clearly freshly prepared. My date enjoyed the halibut with a jerk seasoned preparation. Also was very good. There is zero reservation about dining here and I look forward to my next visit.",

Come here for that alone and you won't be disappointed. The service: they might ride a little on their view and reputation moreso than they should, but with that said, you don't achieve their price point with at least good service. They were attentive, helpful when asked but not overly so. Food: the salmon is something my mouth buds still think about. Let's be honest, if the foods good, it can speak a world of sweetness upon any other short coming. My favorites were the honey salmon, garlic mashed potatoes, and a surprising entrant was the sesame/Asian dressing on the house salad.. man, we're my tastebuds happy with this whole experience. Beverages: they apparently have a wine guy, but mine was selected without his help, thank you very much, and that Pinot noir was a tasty piece. Also tried the black walnut old fashioned and that was a thing of dreams.. like literally, I still taste dream of it! Overall, a great experience. My least favorite aspect was the service, since I thought they let their reputation ride more on product than presentation, but that just means it was great food/experience without someone bugging you, so I guess it's a win overall. Would definitely recommend this for an occasion celebration.. and go on a clear night to maximize the stunning views!",

Even though the group was large, we were served well and despite lapses in service (slow to bring drinks etc.) it was an overall positive experience.    The set menu was very nicely laid out and he salad was fresh and crisp with a lemon dressing.  We were served exceptional bruschetta which I must say was very refreshing and had little or no onion (my preference) so it was a big hit for me - and a great way to cleanse the palate...  The crab cakes were exceptional.  They were mostly crab and very little other stuff, so they tasted more of the sea and the crab itself rather than the stuffing.  Recommended highly!  The choice for me was Chilean sea bass and I must say it was cooked perfectly.  The meat was flaky and moist and the greens and vegetables surrounding it were crunchy - just how I like them.  Overall a delightful dish and highly recommended  I would love to go back.  The service speed and somewhat dryer ambiance make it a 4 for me.  Or maybe a 4.5.  I need to go back to check it out again.    I recommend this spot!",

Then I asked to get a wine menu so we could order a bottle of wine for the table. Well, no, that can't be done. Eh? For some reason they did not want me to order a bottle of wine. I thought I would have to pull out my wallet and start throwing $20 bills on the table. Another member of our party had a similar experience trying to get something else that deviated from their plan for our group.   The hors-d'ouevres were not warm.   All in all I would go to the park for the view and some other place for food. Sorry MB, it wasn't nearly as good as expected.",

I can only imagine that there are a lot of people who have not had the opportunity to eat fish outside of the greater Pittsburgh area because nothing can explain the good reviews except for a complete lack of knowledge of what decent food tastes like. Sure, this place has a nice view. But, you don't need to subject yourself to the hideously overpriced and utterly foul food here for the view.   I will admit that the bread was good. But, not a single other thing was. The crab cakes, the sea bass, the sole, the vegetables... all awful. Not of too poor quality for the price, but awful at any price. The food was, as my dinner partner called it, \"delightfully compostable.\"   Save up your money and go on a vacation to a city with decent fish. You deserve better than this.",

    "text": "My wife and I made reservations almost a month in advance after doing some extensive research. I was in Pittsburgh on business a few weeks ago and it happened to coincide with my birthday weekend so she joined me for a couple of days.  The ambiance is fantastic, modern and sophisticated and its location offers views that are hard to match.   We started the night with the Roasted Butternut and Beets Salad. Because it was not really in season it did not have butternut squash but it was still a great, earthy and sweet salad.  My wife followed with the Two MB Signature Crab Cakes which were perfectly seasoned and had great texture, something that many restaurants struggle with.  I had the Chimichurri Chilean Sea Bass and being from Argentina I must confess that I am very particular as to what carries the \"chimichurri\" label. That said, I am excited to report that it held True to its roots. The outside was firm, almost crispy while the meat remained soft, moist and flaky. A little salt and not much else was used to prevent the combination of the chimichurri and other spices from overpowering this sweet and delicate fish. I added two Seared Jumbo Sea Scallops and they were expertly prepared and accompanied by a lemon wedge wrapped in fine cloth.The presentation of such a simple dish was perfect.  As a side we shared the the Fried Brussel Sprouts which were cooked with bacon and a balsamic reduction that complemented them very well.  I was, at first, a bit worried about the wine list as I didn't see anything I would consider a high end wine, by the glass. I was pleasantly surprised, however, after trying a Malbec from WA (again, being from Argentina I am a bit of a snub when it comes to this wine) that left me wanting more and so I enjoyed a second glass. Try the Waterbrook Malbec if you like a medium body wine that pairs great with almost everything.  For desert we were served a complimentary Creme Brulee that was delicious. We decided to take it back to the hotel for a midnight snack.  If you find yourself in Pittsburgh and want to enjoy more than just a great meal, Monterrey Fish Grotto should earn a spot on your short list. Chin Chin!",

This restaurant has a great view and it was a great way for a first timer to Pittsburgh like me to see the various areas of the city and the way the rivers connect and the skyline of downtown.  I was impressed by the wide selection of seafood, both type and preparation on the menu, so much I was pretty overwhelmed making my selection.  I am always impressed by restaurants that have the date on the top of their menu, showing that they change their menu daily based on what is fresh and available.  I finally decided on the yellow fin tuna with the stuffed preparation, which had mushrooms, and goat cheese and finished with a marsala sauce.  Our party chose the fingerling potatoes and creamed spinach as our sides to split.  When my meal came I was extremely impressed by the presentation - it was a generous serving of tuna and the preparation with the mushrooms and sauce looked delicious.  It reminded me of a preparation you would normally see for steak rather than fish, but tuna being a meatier fish it could handle this preparation.  The waitress had explained when we ordered that all fish is prepared to medium, except the tuna which is cooked to medium rare.  Well that was probably my only complaint about this dish - my tuna was cooked to a medium maybe even medium well (one inch thick steak with about a quarter inch of sear on either side) and I would have enjoyed it less well done.  Our sides were also delicious!  I was unsure if I would enjoy the creamed spinach, but it was prepared au gratin (who doesn't love anything which has cheese on it) and was well seasoned with nutmeg and salt, but not too salty.  Overall my dining experience here was pleasant - good food and good atmosphere. Also the waitress was very well versed in the different preparation of the fish and took her time in lots of detail explaining their daily specials which I always appreciate in a higher end restaurant like this!",

The prices are seriously up there, but within the realm of reason for most things. Definitely only a special occasion restaurant but still very good. Only thing I'd change today would be their music! Odd pan flute selections made me think I was in a yoga studio, not a restaurant. So strange!",

It's definitely not a place I would be going once a week because it is a bit pricey, but for special occasions, absolutely! The view is to die for! Go at sunset. Magical!  The decor is dated but I think they may be changing this soon if they have not already.  I definitely recommend this restaurant if you've never been. The food, the service and the amazing view create an unforgettable dining experience.",

Our waiter, Glen, was outstanding, the manager came to our table twice to make sure we were having a good time, and the food was out of this world. Considering the variety on their menu, I already can't wait to go back! I have 3 things lined up in my head.    P.S. The Gentlemen's Cocktail is the best drink on the menu!",

The view is second to none, being it is overlooking the city on a high floor in Mt Washington connected to and apartment complex. The server was very knowledgeable about the food and was good to answer any questions we had about the menu. My girlfriend got some sushi. It looked and tasted amazing. She has lived in Florida and Baltimore and she said it was some of the best she's had. Both presentation and taste wise. I got some crab stuffed shrimp which was also amazing. There fresh fish selection is so good. It is always tough for me to pick something because I want it all. If you are having some drinks and dinner, expect to pay at least $150.00. It is well worth it though for a nice dinner out. We live in Mt Washington now, so we will be back.",

Very fresh, light fish and the combination of olives, artichokes, tomato, mushrooms was a great addition to the mild fish. Husband had crab cakes and swears they are the best he's ever had. Big chunks of flavorful crab meat with remoulade.  Yummy, yummy. Side dishes are served family style and one is enough for two people.   Extensive wine and drinks menu.

I had the half chicken with rice and mixed veggies.  It was FANTASTIC!  Other people who did order fish raved about the crab cakes and the sword fish.  After dinner we sampled a few different types of desserts and I highly recommend the New York style cheesecake- it was the best cheese cake that I have ever had!

The positives:  we had a great table which wasn't technically the \" windowseat\" but once the sun started to go down we had the best sunset!  Our server was wonderful as well.  She was attentive and made us feel welcome to stay to socialize.  The not so positives:  No specials.  Just the menu. In the past there were chef specials that included sides and extras.  We ordered side dishes of potatoes and asparagus...potatoes were over cooked and the asparagus was average. Our entrees were good. Crabcakes were great...scallops were dry, sea bass was good but was lonely on a big plate. Swordfish Parmesan is what drew our grad.  They changed the recipe and now it has a breading and fried. Still good but not what we remember. No more complementary salad. Good food but for the price?...  We live closer to Off the Hook and find the chef there ( who was at MBFG) has it down. The desserts were good but the Steaming Chocolate late  was smaller and not as good as Off the Hook.  Still enjoyed the ambience and the view. But not surprised that they were half full.  Next occasion will be at Off the Hook. May be back for college graduation with a cocktail. Sad that the food didn't stay or improve with the remodel. I'd take 1980's palm trees for the old chef.",

    "text": "So far, Monterey Bay Fish Grotto has been the best restaurant we've been to in Pittsburgh. I visited with my wife and three other couples, all new to the area. 7 of the 8 of us are from Miami, Florida and most of us fish and lobster dive, so we are used to excellent and fresh seafood. This place was a hit for all of us. I would like to give it 5 stars, but a couple of things knocked it down to a 4 for me. I'll start with the good, though.   #1: The view. Obviously, among the best views from any restaurant every where. Everyone at our table had something beautiful to look at (besides their lovely partners, of course), from the Sunset on one side to the city sky line on the other. It was the kind of place where every table had a great view. The decor was also classy, and created a very nice ambience.   #2: Most of the food was phenomenal. We had calamari, crab cakes, and a sampler appetizer which was delicious. It combined Ahi tempura and Ichiban served on a skewer, each with wonderful texture and flavor. The dessert was a lavender creme brulee which was as delicate, aromatic, and delicious as it sounds. All of my dining companions enjoyed their entrees. My friend to my right had the crab-stuffed giant scallops and couldn't finish them. Thank goodness for me! I got to share some of her left-overs, and it was one of the most perfect bites of food I have ever tasted. the scallop had been seasoned and cooked perfectly, so it had the perfect texture; smooth, not tough or rubbery as it can be when over-cooked. The crab inside was perfection - large chunks of moist delicious crab without any hint of fishiness. It was clearly fresh off of the plane, just as the waitress promised when it was introduced.   The bad:  #1: The grouper. Again, I am from Miami, and most of the grouper I have eaten in my life went from my own fish hook to my plate, (or maybe my uncle's fish hook if I was having one of my more typical bad luck fishing days). When I've eaten grouper in restaurants, it's always been fresh off of the boat in places like the Florida Keys. Perhaps that's why I found this particular grouper very disappointing. It's hard to explain what was wrong with it, but it just wasn't nearly as good as other grouper I've had. It didn't taste quite as fresh, delicate, or mild. It may have been the way it was prepared. I had it, \"Monterey style\". This meant it was prepared with artichoke hearts, black olives, tomato, garlic, green onion and mushrooms, sauteed in a Marsala wine sauce. This was a definite fail. The flavors were good, but completely over-powered the fish and brought out all of the wrong flavors in it. It seemed like a better seasoning for something like chicken, not grouper. I probably should have gone with Mango pepper style.  #2: The cost. I might have been less dissapointed if I hadn't paid 50-75% more then I ever had for much better grouper in Florida. Well, I guess the flight from MIA to PITT isn't cheap. While I think most of the other dishes were well worth the cost, my entree was less then outstanding.   I'd still go back, but I won't be ordering grouper, or \"Monterey style\". I'll probably have more of those incredible scallops all to myself this time. Also, it will probably be for a special occasion, given the price.",

On a positive note, the server was professional and very attentive; and of course, the view is magnificent. To start, I ordered the Caesar salad which arrived with wilted lettuce that was drenched in a flavorless dressing. For the main course, I decided on the Coq au Vin which proved to be the wrong choice. When the dish came, all I could see was a miniscule piece of chicken drowning in a sea of a heavy dark brown sauce, accompanied by no garnish, nothing. My husband ordered the stuffed shrimp which included 4 petite overcooked shrimp. Needless to say, we were exceedingly disappointed. Again, the view is spectacular, but it's not worth the high price of the lackluster food.",

Our friend ordered a cosmo only to be told that they were out of cranberry juice.  Then she ordered a strip steak only to be told they did not have any.  The waitress said that she was sorry and she was going to send the manager over.  She came back a short time later and said the manager would not be over because \"there is nothing that can be done about just being out of things\" I was shocked that a high end restaurant would be so blase' their shortcomings.  I am not sure if there is new ownership but in addition  the food was not as good as it used to be, will not be heading back.",

From the second we checked in every one that greeted us congratulated us! We were taken to our beautiful seat right at the window The waitress was the best I ever had Cindy! Cindy was with the company as long as we've been married and was knowledgable and friendly She was funny and even took or picture without asking. We had the trio appetizer which was the famous crab cake, ichoban and a few Cajun shrimp!  For the entree We both had the fresh halibut, mine was prepared with apples and chorizo sausage and crusted with a finely ground granola. It tasted like fall! My wife had hers prepared with the parmesan sauce and it was also outstanding   Then as a great surprise we were given a complimentary dessert for our celebration ! Although you do pay for the view, the food is excellent Fresh and perfectly prepared",

Also had one of the best cocktails I've ever had--strawberry fields--although it took a very long time to arrive. Unfortunately, I kind of didn't like my meal. I had the cheddar grits, and they had a sauce on them that reminded me of a cheap salsa from the grocery store. It totally ruined the dish and I wasn't able to finish it. My boyfriend loved his, though, so maybe I just ordered badly. Overall, cool experience.",

It's served as a whole fish which may sound challenging to eat...it was simple.  My wife had the salmon, which she said was very good. We ordered the scalloped potatoes and chipotle creamed corn as our sides, again, both were very good.

The taste, texture and consistency is hands down the best I've had.  It's also a good portion so you're not left hungry.    The fish is also pretty fresh and the dishes are delicious though as I recall, the fish dishes were uninspiring, offering very little creativity. The ingredients didn't jump out at me. Presentation and ambience is great for Pittsburgh, offering great views of the city. Nice place to take clients or your date.

We went here on Saturday night and everything from our drinks, our food, the service, and the view made for a really wonderful evening.  We arrived an hour prior to our reservation to have drinks.  I had the Dragonberry Mojito and this is my new fave drink.  It wasn't overly fruity, but just right.  We had the sampler as an appetizer which included Cajun sauteed shrimp, crab cake, and a hibachi skewer.  Since I only eat shrimp, I had the Cajun sauteed shrimp, and this was the best shrimp I have ever had.  I am also not a spicy person and the cajun seasoning was just right for me.  My boyfriend enjoyed the rest of the appetizer.  He also had the  butternut soup with crab meat and was ready for more.  I ordered the ribeye special and he had the blackened and cajun chargrilled salmon.  We also got shrimp fried rice as our side.  I can't even begin to describe how enjoyable and tasty all of my food was.  It was incredible.  Our waitress, Pam, was pleasant and funny.  The decor of the restaurant is a little strange, but with the view of the city and all the restaurant offers, that hardly matters.  (My mouth is watering just thinking about this.)",

I didn't always like seafood so the first time I ate here I ordered the steak and it was delicious.  Now I like many different types of seafood so I can appreciate the cuisine even more.  They fly in fresh fish daily and you can tell.  The crab cakes are spectacular, they're my favorite.

I went with a mentor/colleague to \"celebrate\" a job termination (don't ask) and we had the whole experience.  Our waitress was very nice and tentative.  One of the managers, who is a wine afficianto, helped us pick out a good wine on the moderately priced side.  The wine was fantastic.    We ordered steamed clams as an appetizer and -oh so good- with their hot bread to dip in the sauce.  The manager learned I lost my job and brought us a \"chocolate cake\" drink, on the house, which was very nice.    House salads were fresh and a nice size portyion.  I ordered the mahi mahi and it was fantastic.  Nice size portion, fresh.  Only complaint was that the lemon wedge was too small to put over the fish...  Finally, the dessert...

At the entrance you take an elevator up to the main dining room on one floor or the bar on another floor or the wine cellar on another floor.  The view of the downtown three river section of the city is really quite exceptional, particularly as the sun goes down.  By the way the seafood was as good as or better than the view.",

WE had Chileab Sea Bas with the Honey lime sauce and Rockfish with Thai peanut sauce. We devoured the chipotle creamed corn and the vanilla creme brulee..and cookie melted in our mouths. And to think we got the restaurant off of our boarding pass as an advertisement. Best choice we have made in a awhile. If we ever come back we will definitely return. The staff was very courteous and we even left the restaurant in the elevator with the chef.",

We both had a fantastic meal. She had a grilled Seabass and I had a barbeque mahi-mahi. Both pieces of fish were cooked to perfection. Our server was timely and never made us feel we had to hurry up. Our drinks were expertly prepared and served to perfection. We had a great night. Someday they should update the elevator, sooner the better.",

You have to take an elevator up to the restaurant, where there are gorgeous views. We were sat right next to the window, which I highly recommend if you can get it, and had a great view of the city while we dined. I can't comment on the drink selection too much since I was a newb when we went - I had my first alcoholic beverage here. I got the strawberry mojito which was too sweet for my tastes. Our server recommended a wine to pair with the grouper I ordered and it was successful! My date got tuna over forbidden rice and that was delicious too. The server realized it was my birthday and we got the lollipop cake trio for free as well as the manager stopping by to wish me happy birthday. I can't say enough good things about this place. The location, food and service are all at a level that the prices aren't painful. I can't wait to go back!",

I had the house salad and ~50% of the lettuce was either frozen or obviously just thawed. I've never had this situation at a restaurant before and hope to never again. My entree was the yellow fin tuna which was supposed to be \"sushi grade\". The fish was under-seasoned and had the mushy texture of sashimi that's past its prime. The other sides on the plate could've come out of a home kitchen (in the sense that they were ordinary, not homey or comforting). I would eat there again for free but would never pay for it. This caliber of food would never fly at a \"fine-dining\" restaurant in any other metropolitan city I've lived in.",

The waiter was attentive and kind, and immediately noted that I had a gluten allergy indicated on my reservation. He brought me gluten-free bread with a separate dish of butter to start (gluten-free bread is essentially never offered at a restaurant). Our seafood trio appetizer was spectacular: a gluten-free crab cake with marinated fish pieces and two jumbo shrimp. Our lobster bisque was great. They pour the soup in with the cream at your table. The flavor was not salty (as some lobster bisques are). Did I mention their lobster bisque is gluten-free? By the time I got to my main course - lobster risotto - I was too full to heave more than a few bites, so I took most of it home. It was equally good, if not better, re-heated in the oven!   Our experience was fantastic. It was the most expensive meal we've had in years, but it was well worth it for a big celebration.",

Unfortunately, I can't rate this place more than 3 stars because when we made a reservation we were told to come early to try to get a seat near the window, and when we arrived an hour before our reservation we were told they didn't even have a table large enough to accommodate us near the window. They even suggested we might not be seated on the lower floor a few tables away from the window. After a lot of anxiety and some moderately unpleasant interactions with the hostesses we sat in the lounge for an hour before getting a table on the floor a table back from the window. The lounge was great, with perfect views and perfect service.  The disappointment and stress we experienced at the hostess stand definitely dampened the mood of the night. The manager and server were very nice, but I suspect that they secretly hated us.   We were eventually able to enjoy multiple appetizers, entrees, bottles of wine, and cocktails.  Overall, food and view were awesome. If you make a reservation you need to be clear about what you're asking for/what you can expect to get. I'm going to assume this place would offer a 4/5 star experience if you didn't start your night in the same manner we did.",

The drinks were amazing and the bartender suggested a seafood sampler/appetizer that was too perfect. The crabcake was almost 100% crabmeat (not like some places that use half breadcrumbs), and the sauce under the fish skewers was to die for. The main reason I gave this 5 stars however was the service. The place was crowded but the bartenders made sure we got a seat as soon as a group left by promptly cleaning up and getting us in. Our drinks came out super quick and were super delicious. That martini was absolutely the best I have ever had, hands down. Thank you D and Dimitry for everything! We will DEFINITELY be back!!!",

The bread was delicious and warm but the butter was seasoned and really good, I may have filled up too much on that. We ordered classic raw oysters and a crab cake to share for appetizers. They are known for their crab cakes and I can certainly see why. I would have definitely eaten that as my entree happily. A lot of the entrees have a couple different choices on how it can be prepared. I got the red snapper Mediterranean style, it was good. He got the sea bass and loved it. Then we couldn't decide on a dessert so we got the raspberry chocolate torte and then passionfruit icebox cake to go. And the service was phenomenal. I felt like I couldn't take a sip of water without someone filling it back up. It was such an attentive staff and enjoyable experience. The view was killer and we loved the incline ride over.",

I made a reservation online for my boyfriend's birthday. Window seats at this restaurant are a hot commodity (and you can't reserve with your reservation), so if you want one I would get there early, because they have a first come first serve waiting list for anyone wanting a window seat.  We were able to sit by one of the side windows which was still pretty cool if you ask me! The service was awesome! Our waiter was really nice and was able to give us great descriptions of the menu items we asked about.    We ended up ordering: Scallops and Crab Cakes - Everything cooked to perfection! The crab cakes had huge lumps of crab in them and the scallops were buttery deliciousness! Caribbean Halibut - I honestly didn't care for this meal much at all.  It was pretty bland and I was expecting a lot more of the fruit salsa.    When I booked the reservation online I added a note saying that it was for a birthday.  After our meal was finished our waiter told us to pick 2 desserts on the house!!! SO NICE!  We ordered: Angel Food Grilled Cheese - The hype is totally real! Grilled angel food cake with a cream cheese center...soooo gooood! Pot de Creme - Sweet and salty and oh so delicious! It came with some fruit that was so yummy when dipped in the pot de creme.   Overall, this was a wonderful experience! The view, the food, and the staff made this a great place to celebrate!",

Excellent service, very good food. Yes it's quite expensive, but the view is awesome and the experience was worth it.  We returned this year, again in a large group. Service was still good and the view was lovely as before.  The food however had dropped off significantly.  We ordered a wide variety of drinks and dishes. We returned a few and others were just odd.  For instance, there was goat cheese on a steak - nothing on the menu about goat cheese.   One of our party correctly identified that overall the dishes lacked \"brightness\". They were all just not standouts. Which isn't a big deal, except you are paying for exceptional.  Overall a disappointing outing in a beautiful, expensive  setting  One of our party",

They blew me away! Very comparable to Maryland crab cakes, no filler and just piled on for a great crab cake patty. For dessert I ordered the grilled cheesecake. His again was another yelp recommendation! It is a crispy cheesecake glazed with ice cream and a raspberry sauce. You can also just come here for this dessert and be impressed. I saved the best for last with the view. The view at night is amazing. You get to see all the buildings and all the bridges which Pitt is famous for!  It's very pricey but the food and view are worth it. So if you are looking to treat yourself give this a try.",

They kept the wine flowing and were very attentive. They boasted about the crab cakes and I was craving scallops. Luckily they had a pairing of 1 crab cake and 4 large scallops. The scallops were to die for(still thinking about them).   We got several different sides, my favorites being the lobster Mac and cheese and the Brussels sprouts.   Appetizer wise, the calamari was light and crispy and delicious.   Like I said, they kept the wine coming and we never had to turn around constantly looking for a server.   From our table was a gorgeous sunset view of the city. If you go downstairs to the bar, there's some lounge chairs with another spectacular view of the city.   Yes, it is expensive but TOTALLY worth it. High class service, food and wine.",

Valet parking is available but I can usually find street parking on one of the side streets nearby. The only reason I give this 4 stars though is that the prices are quite high for what you get, but I guess you are paying for the view.",

Our server was very knowledgeable on all the food items and wine pairings; he made some incredibly recommendations. I have traveled quite a bit and love seafood and I have to say the fish and crab preparations were very well done. For our meal I had the Mediterranean prepared red snapper and my boyfriend had the Parmesan halibut and it is probably some of the best prepared fish I've had over all my travels from California to my home in Maryland.  The staff was very catering in fact, when I was brought the wrong preparation of my meal the manager personally brought the right preparation and gave us some fresh bread to leave with. The best part of the night was our waiters recommendation of the dessert which was the angel food cake grilled cheese. Sounds crazy but it was a brulee styled angel good cake with cream cheese between the two pieces served with fresh berries and ice cream. As my boyfriend put it, \"it was not just good dessert, it was a dessert that I probably would spend the rest of my life eating.\"  All in all, the venue was beatifically with romantic lighting and an incredible view of the city Pittsburgh, and I will definitely find myself back there in the future.",

We went on a very busy Sunday night but we were still able to get a table right next to the front glass window. The view is absolutely amazing.   Our server was very knowledgable about the different types of wine we were interested in. The maitre de came over to help us select the bottle that would accompany our meals with the best flavors. He could not have been more correct. We selected a Pinot Noir from Oregon and it made the night completely worth it!  We started with a salad, of which I can't remember the name but it was good. For my entree I selected the Walu Escalar from Hawaii. It was prepared with a parmesan  cream based sauce and it was to die for! My boyfriend selected the Chilean Sea Bass prepared the Caribbean way. He was more than pleased.   I had called ahead just to ask for the window table for his birthday dinner. Our hostess must have remembered and made a note of it because once we ordered the banana foster cheesecake, it came on a platter that said \"Happy Birthday\" in chocolate. It was the perfect touch to our amazing experience. We will be returning this summer for our anniversary & I cannot wait to see what the seasonal selections are.",

Our reservation was for 8:30 and we were seated at a window table by 9:00. It's worth the little wait!! Amazing view!!!! While we were waiting, we had drinks in the lounge area. We had a nigiri/sashimi plate and an incline roll for appetizers. Both were great and SO fresh for being sushi in PA. For dinner, we split a crab cake entree because we were getting full from the apps... which was easily the best crab cake I have ever had...it's not really breaded like most crab cakes...it's slightly torched. Our server was also great! The entire staff is so professional and make the experience. Also...the green onion butter is to die for! It's sometimes a gamble with upscale restaurants bc sometimes the atmosphere is what you really pay for while the food is subpar...this is definitely not the case here! Worth the prices!!",

Specifically request a view by the window, and you'll be awestruck the whole meal by the amazing view of Pittsburgh - the restaurant's main redeeming characteristic. Our waiter was also very pleasant and attentive.   THE BAD: The food, yo. And the prices. I am continually disappointed by the food at upscale, pricey restaurants. The food just doesn't live up to the hype, and the Fish Grotto was no exception. I didn't like the meal I got at all (one of their more expensive fish), and enjoyed my salad appetizer and the free bread significantly more, in fact.   THE UGLY: The atmosphere. It's themed like the tropics, I guess? With huge fake palm trees everywhere? It sort of reminded me of the cheesy casino in the 1990s movie The Mask. Not really the upscale atmosphere I look for in an expensive meal out.   IN SUMMATION: If you want to cruise up the duquesne incline and end at a restaurant, I wouldn't really pick this one, especially since you can see the view of the city for free outside. The food isn't worth it, especially for these prices.",

It's probably better to just come here for drinks to be honest. At least the service was very friendly.  Chilean seabass with korean bbq preparation. It sounded great... but.. it didnt taste very impressive. When I think seabass I think flaky, buttery tasting fish. This was kinda dry and mostly tasteless. Maybe they cooked it too long, I dunno? But it didnt taste like anything special, ESPECIALLY for $39. Probably the worst seabass I've had to be honest.  Lobster mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was runny and just not that good. Usually mac and cheese is rich, gooey and tasty but not this one. It ended up with a bunch of watery sauce in the plate and while it wasn't terrible, it def was not good.  Fettucini with salmon. Of all the things this was probably the best... of the worst. It was ok. If it was 12 bucks id probably be like \"you know that wasnt so bad\" but it was nothing to write home about. My pasta ended up stuck together in a huge mass that practically needed to be cut to separate. The salmon chunks that came with it were ok. Nothing special.  Basically I would NEVER eat dinner here again. They've won awards so maybe I just had an off night. Regardless, I just can't recommend you eat here. Come here and go downstairs and get some drinks and enjoy the view, skip the food.",

We have decided to have a small wedding ceremony and reception with just family (10 people).  We wanted to come into Monterey Bay for our small reception dinner.  We didn't need a private room, just a nice table that we were hoping would be near the windows for the best view and a little more private.    I called and spoke with the hostess. We explained that it would be our wedding reception dinner and that we were just interested in ordering from the menu.  We asked about seating and if they would accommodate a window seat, or what they would suggest since it is a special night out.  The hostess bluntly informed me that they do not reserve window seats and it is first come first serve.  If someone before our 6:30 reservation requested that table, they would receive it instead of us.  Ok... I can understand that. I can appreciate that policy.  But, this is a small wedding dinner. This is a special day for us, even if we aren't planning on spending over 25K for a full blown private reception, we feel that we should get to have a special night.  We made the reservation and I continued to search for other options.    Yesterday, we found another restaurant on Mt. Washington that would accommodate us, gave us the information for their pastry chef so that we could have a special dessert created, and was excited to have us as patrons at their restaurant.  I called to cancel our Monterey Bay reservations and I explained why we were canceling.  The hostess replied with, \"OK - we'll cancel your reservation\" and hung up.  Guess they don't really care that we will never be back, or that they have zero customer service to patrons that were planning on spending up to or more than $2,000 on dinner, drinks, and desserts...",

Dinners average $38-40 and that doesn't include anything. A salad is an additional $8-10 and sides start about $8.  The selection on the menu has been significantly reduced as well as the optional choices they always gave you in how they prepare the food. Very disappointing.  Seems like the new owners bought the name only. There are better restaurants of this caliber which have a better selection and less pricey.",

I have been here quite a few times (at least 5 without really going back and counting).  Each time I have gone to the Monroeville location (first in the old office building and then at the mall).  My first time was there was in high school and my idea of seafood was lobster and crab, so I was disappointed that those dishes aren't on the menu, but that did not take away from a wonderful first meal and every meal since.  My staple go to dish is their peppercorn yellow fin tuna.  I have always been more of a meat and potatoes kind of guy and love a good steak.  The tuna is as good if not better than any filet that you would order at a premier steak house.  The decor and the wait staff are also compliment the experience.  Since I live in Rochester, NY now, Monterey Bay is a must go to when I go home to visit.",

The portions are reasonable and we probably over ordered on the appetizers and side dishes, but our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. They were able to sit us close enough to the table, since we had a big party and see some of the views. We had friends from out of town and wanted to show off parts of Pittsburgh to them.  We started with the crab cakes, tuna sashimi and mussels HK style. The crab cakes were the BEST and LEGIT all crab. I could skip the mussels and tuna for next time. The wasabi on the tuna was really potent and the mussels weren't plump this time of the year. I had the black cod sable fish and it was perfectly cooked. Each bite was filled with happiness and the meat was just a perfect combination of tenderness, juiciness and joy. The waiter service was friendly and played along our jokes. All of the other dishes of fish were also delectable. We're big sharers at this table. For the sides, we got the pumpkin risotto, brussel sprouts, lobster mac n cheese and sauteed greens. The risotto was great with a little bit of sweetness. The mac and cheese was well done with a hint of lobster. I didn't enjoy the brussel sprouts as they were too soft for me. I would definitely come back for more.",

The service was lovely and the dinner was wonderful.  Unlike so many other places on Mount Washington where you just climb a set of stairs to have a second floor view of the city, at Monterey Bay Fish Grotto you actually get in an elevator and go WAY up. The views are beautiful!  Once inside the restaurant, you are greeted by a very friendly person who has the waitstaff escort you immediately to your table.  FI and I split the calamari. FI isn't a big seafood fan (I know, I know) but he took me here because he knows that I love seafood! I couldn't believe it but he actually really enjoyed the calamari!  After that, I ordered one of the specials of the night -- Chilean sea bass that came with butternut squash and some kind of tomato risotto. It was AMAZING! Seriously so so good.  As if things couldn't get any better, I ordered the angel food grilled cheese for dessert. It sounds weird, but believe me when I tell you this was seriously up there with the best desserts I've ever eaten (and I've consumed many, many desserts). Honestly, if I were to choose my last dessert on earth, it might be this.  Can't wait to return!",

    "text": "The first time I came here for a date night.  The service was great, the entrees (Swordfish chop was somewhat bland and salmon was very flavorful) where decent and the desserts amazing (Angel food Grilled Cheese and the Chocolate Guava Roll).  My first experience was 4 out of 5 stars; however, the second time was a 2 out of 5 stars.  So my second time here was for a birthday party (8 guests total).  Upon arrival, for a 7:30 reservation, we had to wait in the lounge as they didn't have s table (there were a great deal that said reserved) which makes no sense if we had a confirmed reservation.  So we had a few drinks and then they sat us.  Our server was great; however, lack of communication from the kitchen made the night frustrating.  Several of us ordered a Chilean Sea Bass; however, 30-45 minutes after ordering we are told that they were out.  They were also out of the lobster mac and cheese that had been ordered.  We decide on another entree, but guess what, they were out.  We finally found something that they had (I got the yellow fin tuna) and then continued on with our conversations.  So some members of our group decided to order more wine, but guess what, they were out of the wine they wanted.  I wanted dessert as did my girlfriend; however, they were out of the chocolate guava roll (the only dessert my girlfriend could eat).  It is a good thing that we had brought an ice cream cake!  Oh but they managed to botch that up slightly because the hostess staff member who originally took it back to the kitchen had placed it in the dairy cooler!  So instead we had something between a piece of cake and a milkshake for dessert.  They even ran out of bags to put leftovers in!  Long story short, they were unable to provide 16 items that we requested.  I understand that they could be running low on items by Sunday night, but they could have informed us in a reasonable and timely fashion (improve the communication between the wait staff and the kitchen).  The wait staff was great and we actually were able to joke with them about being out of everything.  My biggest issue is that we didn't get anything comped, and with all the issues from the kitchen, I would have expected the chief to come out and personally apologize.  I am actually going back this Saturday to try their Sakari portion of the restaurant.  I hope it is smooth sailing or it may be the last time I dine here.",

There was a little mix-up when we first arrived, however - they gave us a buzzer to wait for our table and we went down to the bar (which also has amazing views). I guess they forgot about us because when we went upstairs to check on our table 45 minutes later, they looked surprised and apologized and seated us immediately.    We ordered the crab cake appetizer (highly recommend the crab cakes, in fact, probably recommend just getting the crab cake entree). I got the seared ahi tuna stuffed with goat cheese, mushrooms, and spinach.  Honestly, cheese and ahi tuna dont belong together, but once i moved all the cheese to the side it was a really good entree. It was all expensive: for an appetizer, a (cheaper) bottle of wine, 2 entrees, 1 dessert, the bill came out to around $200, eek.  All in all, I would definitely return for another special occasion.",

    "text": "Stopped in on Saturday early evening for date night. We opted to park on the street versus Valet for $6, simply because we were able to get a street spot easily and had a feeling we needed a little walk after we stuffed ourselves silly with all the great food!   We took the elevator up along with the crowd of people waiting, which had a large window overlooking the city so you can catch a glimpse if you enter the elevator facing the back. Since we had a reservation, we were seated promptly at a table in the main dining room facing the floor to ceiling windows. Although all the tables by the windows were taken, we didn't mind since it was foggy and rainy, there wasn't much of a view.   I forget the name of our server, but he was polite and efficient. He let us know of the specials and recommendations and gave us enough time to look over the menu. We continued to order the Sakari Sushi Roll for our appetizer, which was phenomenal. It was probably my favorite part of the meal. The sushi tasted fresh and the texture of the tempura outer shell was crispy and light. Very tasty, indeed. For entrees, we ordered the Salmon special which was accompanied by a sweet potato and flash fried shrimp. My date thought it was delicious. I ordered the famous crab cakes, and boy the other reviewers weren't kidding about how good they were. The crab cakes had 90% crab and hardly any fillers. Well worth the $36 price tag. For the side dish, we shared the crab Mac and cheese. This was the only dish I wasn't crazy for. Especially for the $19 price tag, there was barely any crab and the cheese was overly creamy and the macaroni was a little too al dente for my taste. For dessert we got the Angel food cake grilled cheese. Although it was delicious, I regret not getting the Pineapple Upside down bread pudding instead. Another table had ordered it and I was drooling at the sight of it. And they were shoveling it down faster than I could blink, so I imagine it was tasty! :)   Overall, with a couple of drinks and coffee, our bill came to just under $200. I think this meal was very good, but I think I would have saved it for more of a special occasion like a birthday or Anniversary. But the service was impeccable and the Manager Skylar was very nice and checked in a couple of times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.",

    "text": "I am somewhat conflicted by Monteray Bay. I want to absolutely love this place, but i honestly can't.    My wife and i went there recently celebrating our anniversary. It was a pretty big deal to us. When i made the reservation i noted this and hoped to get a window table. I purposely made the reservation slightly off peak. When we arrived, on time, we had to wait almost 15 minutes to be seated. I was disappointed in the seats we were given. I asked politely if there was a chance we could be seated by a window, and was told that would require at least an hour wait. We sat in such a way that my wife had a decent view. I had virtually no view unless a turned almost sideways.    Oh well, this happens, and i wasn't going to allow it to taint our celebration. Our server greeted us and reviewed some of their specials, bit dinner and appetizer.  They suggested a combo appetizer that had a small crab cake, 2 shrimp, and a skewer with several small pieces of Tuna and Salmon on it. That sounded like a nice light appetizer to share, so we ordered it. We got our drinks and perused the menu.     Obviously their focus is on seafood, and they offered a nice selection on their menu. While we were trying to decide, one of the managers came to our table and greeted us. He wished us a happy anniversary(nice touch), and when my wife asked for some input on her choice, he suggested a particular fish. She decided to order what he suggested.    We received our appetizer, and it was indeed small. Just enough to take the edge off, and very very tasty. My wife wanted to taste their lobster bisque, but didn't want too much food before the entree, so we agreed to share a bowl. The server actually brought it to us already divided into two separate portions(another nice touch). Awesome. It wasn;t quite as good as a local restaurant that we visit, but it was certainly good.     The server had taken our order and we were relaxing and talking and enjoying the night.  Then, the server came to our table and informed my wife that her fish choice was not available. Seriously? The recommendation of the manager was not available? Not cool. SHe made another choice and kept her fingers crossed.    The entrees actually came out pretty quickly. We had ordered a few side dishes since everything there is ala carte.  The food was delicious. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, and everything was very flavorful. We enjoyed our dinners.    We had a second round of drinks and finished our dinners. The server informed us that since it was our anniversary, if we wished to share a dessert it would be com0plimentary (yet another nice touch). We have the angelfood cake cheese sandwich which was unique and quite good.    All in all, it was a very nice dining experience and we enjoyed it. So why not 5 stars? Nothing huge, just some small things that added up.    First of all, i am no stranger to fine dining, and to the cost of fine dining. That said, Monteray bay crosses the line into slightly overpriced. That little appetizer was $27 (had no idea when we ordered it) The Lobster bisque(which had a few small langostinos) was $15. They charged us $7 for water.    With all of the competition for fine dining dollars in the area, i think they may be in trouble down the road if they are not careful. From everything i have read and heard, Altius offers a superior dining experience for around the same money. There are other choices too. certainly MB offers a great dining experience, but I am not it is quite worth the check at the end of the night.",

For dinner, she had halibut that was in a sort of orange basil sauce and a colorful potato mix. I had tuna that was stuffed with spinach and goat cheese with a marsala sauce, and crab Mac and cheese. Everything was delicious, and our server, Jeff, who was PERFECT, even helped me pick a great drink. It was a martini with makers mark, and I believe peach liquor, simple syrup, and lemon juice?

Very few people come in with jeans on... The service was pretty good the server and manager did a lot of advising to navigate us through their tremendous menu. IT WAS HUGE- how am I supposed to know what to choose from?!?!   Venue is a pristine and clean they do a tremendous job making it look good. Elevator takes you to the dining hall after you valet your vehicle.   Food portions were small. but tasty we got the swordfish and yellowfin tuna in a Parmesan and mango curry sautees. They tasted very good, I would go with parmesean over mango in hindsight. we got a deliciously soup, that was also quite salty. And the rolls- they were astounding. we got a skewer appatizer with an array of different fish, which was good but entirely too small.   This is a nice classy place to come to celebrate something with somebody special, has a killer view, and well cooked food.   Still it is not the best fish I have had- i would give it 3.5 stars.  Next time i will try the lounge right below the upper level.",

Most crab cakes have bread crumbs or something to hold it all together. Monterey Bay knows how to do it right without the gluten. You do have to tell them when you order, but they are friendly to people with allergies or special diets. (I guess they should be very friendly at that price point).  Or course, the view is wonderful too, and there's not a bad seat in here. The restaurant is tiered so there's tons of great views of the city. Try to catch a sunset up here for dinner. It's certainly a site to see. I can't tell you too much about the food since we always order the crab cakes! So - I'd highly recommend getting them!",

    "text": "My fiance and I came to Monterey Bay Fish Grotto for my birthday dinner and had an excellent meal.  We were seated at a table that had a beautiful window view of downtown Pittsburgh. We were brought warm bread with a champagne spiced butter which was different but good.   For an appetizer we ordered the special which was a Kung Pao Shrimp. The dish featured about 8/9 jumbo shrimp which were flash fried and garnished with a kung pao peanut sauce, pieces of peanuts, and a leafy greens garnish. It was delicious! We were surprised how heart and filling the shrimp were.  For our entrees, we ordered the Crab Cakes ($38), the Chimichurri Chilean Sea Bass ($42), Brussel Sprouts ($8), and their seasonal vegetable which were 14-hour roasted carrots ($12). The Crab Cakes had almost no filling which is hard to find and were about 90% lump crab meat. They were well seasoned and a nice size. The Chilean Sea Bass was slightly underwhelming. There was not much seasoning on the fish and the chimichurri slaw on top of the fish wasn't the best pairing for the buttery flavor of the fish in my opinion. The Chilean Sea Bass was also very small in size. The 14-hour roasted carrots were okay. I wouldn't recommend as the consistency became slightly mushy and they were not well-seasoned. The Brussel Sprouts were the star of the show! They were flash fried and tossed in a soy sauce based/Kung Pao inspired sauce that was phenomenal. I could not stop eating the Brussel sprouts they were so delicious!  I was offered a complimentary birthday dessert and I chose the recommended Angel Food Cake Grilled Cheese (~$10). It was a very, very, very untraditional dessert. It was slices of angel food cake that had been caramelized similar to a Creme Brulee with mascarpone cheese in between and a side of almond custard. It was a weird dessert pairing that I didn't love.  Overall, Monterey Bay Fish Grotto is an excellent choice for an upscale (expensive) seafood dinner. Our dinner for two was around $200. I would visit again but on a special occasion basis.",

    "text": "Average at best.... We came for a birthday celebration based on the wishes of the birthday'er, but I found the food to be overpriced and generally not so good. The view of the city is great and the service is generally pleasant.  So what missed the mark? Lobster bisque was an epic fail. I'm a fan of seafood bisque and this worried me. The texture, consistency, and look reminded me of butternut squash soup. It was chunks of what was supposed to be lobster and soup poured over. It was quite tasteless.  For the entree, I ordered the red snapper with lemon and brown sugar sauce. Hubs got swordfish with chimichurri sauce. Our companions had a lemon sole with strawberry sauce and another halibut with parmesan crust, who enjoyed their fish. Unfortunately, hubs and I found ours undercooked. Not good for swordfish when the texture is suppose to be meater. The chimichurri sauce was minimal as plating decoration. The fish covered with jalapeno and cilantro and parsley.... The red snapper was a bit worrisome, too soft a texture. The skin still on and the sauce way too overpowering by the butter.  We also ordered sides: brussels sprouts with bacon (oily, but good), potatoes (fine, as expected), and asparagus (bad! Hubs thought the bottom could be trimmed, I think they were pass their prime).  We had steaming mocha latte, Angel food grill cheese, and strudel for desserts. The Angel food grill cheese was the winner.  Service was attentive, but incredibly slow. We waited a long time for our entrees. Very long. No one came to check on us during that time, but they comped one dessert for the wait. Unfortunately, dessert was another wait.  Not sure I get it. Definitely doesn't live up to the hype.",

The seafood menu is diverse but not extensive, with a good variety of selections and preparations. I've never been courageous or foolish enough to order a non-seafood dish. Food is well prepared but not extraordinary. The wine list is excellent, with a good range of varieties and prices. Last night's dinner included a crab cake, cajan shrimp, and the excellent grilled cheese angel food cake desert. We'll return after our checking account has a suitable recovery period.",

The hostess and support staff were excellent to deal with. They made our short wait for our table enjoyable. We were seated around the time of our dinner reservation. Sherrie, our server, was tremendous in serving our selections for dinner. My wife had Crab Dinner and I had Chilean Sea Bass - Hong Kong.  We split our shared asparagus order. All the food prepared perfectly, with little wait. For dessert, my wife had Steaming Chocolate Latte and I had Angel Food Grilled Cheese Sandwich.

    "text": "Came  here for dinner with my lovely partner, and boy oh boy, does the food not live up to its great view.  We started the night with some cocktails. I got the strawberry field cocktail, which was not bad! Very strong and delicious. Honestly, it was a nice moment to just sip our cocktails and take in the view of the city from our table. They also start you with complimentary bread service, which consisted of a nice warm loaf and very delicious butter.   From there, things rapidly went downhill. My lovely partner wanted the deviled eggs appetizer, which I was a little hesitant to agree with, but hey, he's eating dinner with me, and relationships are all about give and take, right? Golly, did we make a terrible ordering decision. Those deviled eggs were just plain gross. We found that they were more palatable once you deconstructed them to average deviled eggs and salmon sliver+caviar components  Our entrees were not much better. He got the salmon with the miso honey glaze preparation, and I, the crab cake and scallops. The waitress (who was very nice), had informed us all fish would be prepared medium, which is standard. His fish was well done, fairly dry, and tasted average. It tasted like something I could make for him at home. For a higher price point, I'm expecting something that, at minimum, is seasoned well and cooked properly.   My entree was a little bit better. The crab cake was pretty delicious. Generous lumps of crabs, although I found the remoulade underneath lacking in flavor and very modest in serving. I've definitely have had better cakes for cheaper elsewhere. The scallops were a sick joke. Cooked correctly, but not even treated with a pinch of seasoning. The lobster sauce did little to help how bland those scallops are.  We also got dessert- standard for our date night. Got a chocolate mouse raspberry torte of some sort. It was ok. A little uninspiring in looks and taste, but it's chocolate and raspberry. You're going to like it anyways.   Tl;Dr- get drinks at the lounge, hard pass on the food.",

The service was superb and our fish cooked to perfection. Valet parking only, cost $7. Coat check service. Menu a la carte.   We started with their special appetizer and holiday cocktails. The snowstorm mojito had a delicious coconut and mint flavor and was like starting dinner with a dessert! The appetizer special was perfect for sharing. My favorite part was hands down the crab cake and next time I'll definitely be getting that as an appetizer or an entree! For entrees we chose the barramundi and red snapper. Both cooked to perfection with the coconut macadamia crusted option and pina colada sauce. If you like a sweet dish, this style of cook is for you! For a side, we had the fried brussel sprouts. After cocktails, appetizer, salad and entrees, we unfortunately had no room for dessert!   I highly recommend Monterey Bay Fish Grotto for any seafood lover! Portions were large and we were not disappointed! It is a pricier place but well worth it. Our bill with tip was $200 which included 1 appetizer, soup, salad, 2 cocktails, 2 entrees and 1 side.",

We had a 5:30 reservation and decided to go a little early to ensure we'd have a window seat. Luckily we did because we got the last one! And I honestly think it was the best table in the house!  Our server Kerri was super friendly and helpful all of her suggestions were on point! She helped us through the wine list as well as the menu. My only complaint is the wine took quite a while to arrive but we were really soaking in the wonderful views so we hardly noticed!  First up we ordered the calamari..seems generic but it's definitely a step above..the dipping sauce was great..the breading actually stuck to it and it was nice and tender with very little chew. We then shared a Caesar salad..she actually brought it out split up for us..I couldn't believe it was only 1 salad as both of our portions were huge and it was only a $10 salad!  For my entree I landed on the crab cake with jumbo scallops and lobster sauce..perfect! Crab cakes have so little filling just all lump crab..they come with an awesome homemade remoulade..just perfect..dining partner landed on sea bass with the chimichuri preparation. It was good..but mine was better!   The atmosphere was absolutely perfect..breath taking views and a modern sleek space. The hidden gem is really in the lounge on the mid level. They have an expansive bar with and amazing view plus a few tables along the windows..if you can't score a window seat upstairs..or if you just want a little more relaxed atmosphere with the same view..hit the lounge!  Can't wait to go back! Thank you for a wonderful experience!",

    "text": "I've been here a handful of times. It's a great place to take visitors because the view is stunning. Sure there are a few other restaurants up on Mount Washington with similar views though Monterey Bay truly has the best, most complete vantage point of Pittsburgh. The restaurant space itself is also very nice, if not a little dated. We got the reservation through Open Table. They had valet parking at a very reasonable $7 though we were able to find street parking nearby. The service was good but not great last night, I think we honestly waited longer to order our food than the time it took for it to arrive after ordering it. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The prices are frankly ridiculous and having been here a few times, I've noticed them creeping up through the years. For $32 you get just a piece of salmon and for $14 you get a side of Brussels sprouts. The sides are intended to be shareable. The prices would be somewhat forgivable if the food was exceptional but unfortunately it is not, or at least it wasn't last night. I had the salmon with the lemon dill and while the sauce was fantastic the salmon was very undercooked. One thing that is exceptional though is the Angel Food Grilled Cheese Sandwich, it is honestly probably the best dessert in all of Pittsburgh. Overall though, reserve this place for very special occasions because the wallet really takes a hit and the food doesn't quite stand up to the price. Alternatively, bypass the pricy food and visit the bar for a drink and you can get the same view.",

(Valentine's Date)   Valet: Quick and easy, high quality finishes in the lobby, well dressed staff (matching winter attire at the time). Nice backlit accents on the walls/elevator.   Entrance: Beautiful introduction into the venue, vast views into the dining space, high quality finishes throughout. Coat check is quick and easy. Table was immediately ready at the allotted time. I was treated like a VIP, with respect and professionalism.   Waiter: Professional with a touch of over-enthusiasm which is okay, talked extensively about specials and preferred choices. Again obviously rehearsed but still appreciated. Consistently checked on refills and if we needed anything. Wasn't obtrusive, perfectly balanced.   Food: 5-star all the way, Crab bisque that I still can't stop talking about, beautiful sea scallops. Everything was top quality and tasted incredible. Ambiance: The piece de resistance, the famed few of the city of Pittsburgh. Beautiful unobstructed views of the city at night through crystal clear floor-to-ceiling windows. We were seated one table away from the windows which was highly appreciated.   An absolute must in the city of Pittsburgh, we eagerly await our second visit!",

    "text": "I went here awhile ago and never got around to posting. My host (for my stay in Pittsburgh) took me to out to the most classic place that people need to go to for food and views. I didn't know anything about Monterey Bay, so I thought it would be another cool dig to chow down at.  Little did I know that this was for those who are looking for a nice, EXPENSIVE night out. Luckily having a full-time job helps, but families and savvy savers might want to avoid this one.  I'm sure everyone has mentioned the location, so I'll get to the food. We opted for the bar downstairs because it's self-seating, and much more intimate (honestly with better views, too). Skipped out on the drinks because I had an early start the next day, and my host and I decided to settle on the ceviche. I thought it was okay. Appreciated the ahi tuna, but the flavor was more than lacking - the taste was slightly pickled and nothing else. I've had better ceviche.  Running on an ahi tuna high, I went with that done sashimi style (seared rare) with pickled ginger and sesame seeds. That was good, much enjoyed and the cut was almost too huge for me to finish. It was worth it, the main dishes all around are worth it. Unfortunately, I forgot what my host ordered, but she said it was a go-to for her - so, I'm assuming she loves it!  Obviously, if we're breaking the bank, might as well get dessert. She did the angel food grilled cheese sandwich, which was absolutely heavenly and I'd eat that all day. I went with a favorite classic: cheesecake, which put me to bed because it was creamier than most I've had, and a little less sweet.   I cried a little inside looking at the bill, but it was definitely for the views that you get. In all honesty, it reminds me of places like XIX or R2L in Philly, and it's great for a one-time date or a special occasion, but I could find better uses and places for my money. Worth it for the trip and experience, but you're not missing out on anything at all.",

Crab cakes are delicious and the \"angel food cake grilled cheese\" desert is something we'd never seen before, but highly recommend!

Perhaps the average fish/seafood diner prefers wine, but when you ask if there is a draft list or what exactly the seasonal beers are, you would think a server in such an establishment would respond with more than just, \"I don't know. It's what's listed there.\" I guess it's too much work to find out the answer? The Ichiban appetizer is tried 'n True. The fish selection and preparations are still somewhat unique, but the portion size was small and overall a far cry from the day of yore. The roasted, tri-color potatoes were average and monochrome. The dessert was the only thing keeping this review from two stars since a birthday was being celebrated. Disappointing.",

    "text": "I ventured here craving some fine dining fare. The elevator up offers very nice views of the city. The restaurant has a very chic ambiance and again offers beautiful views of the city. Since seating was booked I sat at the sushi bar, which offered full service. I ordered the Lobster Tail. I am probably going to come off as being very particular here but given the class of restaurant I suppose it's warranted. When I received my plate, it was placed by the edge of the counter very close to my lap, and the Madeira sauce was on the side of the plate towards the edge making it possible for the sauce to spill onto my lap. Also, the crab stuffing fell off the lobster slightly ruining the presentation. In any case, the dish was delicious and hit the spot.   Looking at all the sushi forced me to cave in and order the Unagi Nigiri (eel sushi), which was also very good. For dessert I ordered the the mini chocolate guava roulades which was splendid. I loved how the mint leaves went with it. The service was very good and the manager came down to check on me and see how I was doing.  All in all, I very much enjoyed my meal and although I did not get to enjoy the view from my seat I'd say it was worth the price. When you do pay that price however, I do feel the criticisms are warranted, but this really did not detract much from the overall satisfaction of the meal and experience and thus stand as opportunities for improvement. That said, I'm glad I got to come here and enjoy this fine dining experience.",

The service and actual restaurant were very nice, but I didn't enjoy my main entree or the sides which really was disappointing. The view from the restaurant is pretty awesome though, so that does make up for a the not great food.   For dinner I had the crab bisque (which was the best), the halibut cooked parmesan style, crab mac and cheese, and brussel sprouts (very good too).  The crab mac and cheese was really dry, and not cheesy/creamy, it was all just stuck together and hard to scoop out of the dish. And perhaps I ordered the wrong style fish/way it was cooked but just didn't really think it was worth the price and didn't taste that great.  Overall we had excellent service and again, the location was really nice.",

I would have expected a restaurant to ask if I still wanted it before serving it.  So I asked for a discount and they said their policy was they don't discount food. What?   Is it also their policy to occasionally not serve items as listed?  It was a minor issue but it really bugged me how they handled it.  They did offer me a free tree or cappuccino.  Bit that aside I would highly recommend the restaurant.",

Of the sides, the best were the fingerling potatoes while the asparagus and beet/butternut squash dishes were flavorless. The oysters on the half shell were the smallest we've seen. Our salmon and crab cake entrees were acceptably good but the whole fish was laden with bones and the calamari was downright awful. We declined dessert and coffee because we feared another over long wait only to be, once again, disappointed with our choices.  We chose Monterey Bay to celebrate our daughters birthday and were expecting to be overwhelmed by a decadent experience. Sadly, Monterey bay gets one star only for its fantastic view of the city and the helpful wine expert.",

You can get up here by driving or taking an incline and walking over.   We had the Opah (Blacked cajun cooked) and Walu (carribean cooked).  These are 2 types of Haiwaiian fish.  The opah tasted a little dry and the Walu was very juicy.  This place is not cheap and the portions are small.  Service is good and you need to make a reservation because it does get packed.  One option is to sit in the lounge (no reservation needed) and have your food there.  They have a dress code but they are lenient on this.    Try to request for a window seat if possible.",

We started with a lovely bottle of red wine that was served properly and was delicious throughout the entire meal. We also tried the sampler app that is not on the menu but suggested by the server, included two jumbo shrimp, a crab cake, and skewered with tuna, sword fish, and salmon. I really enjoyed that and it was a great way to decide what to get for dinner if you're unsure!  I ultimately ended up ordering the crab cakes for dinner because they were so incredible. The jumbo lumps of crab in every night paired with a lobster aioli drizzle are what your seafood dreams are made of. I also ordered a side of scallops which were excellent and we shared an order of asparagus. The asparagus was over cooked for my preference but really wasn't the highlight of the meal.   My friend ordered the sole and sung its praises, as well. We both had the house salad which was light and tasty, and ended the night with creme brulee and the chocolate truffle cake with raspberry sauce.   What an experience. Of course the view of the city is phenomenal and really adds to the overall atmosphere. Our service was very good, but toward the end it felt like she was rushing us or wanted our table.   If you're looking for a place to celebrate or just to treat yourself and you love seafood, you need to try Monterey Bay!",

It's obviously a special occasion restaurant but it wasn't too quiet, it was lively but not at all too loud.  Locals take out of town guests!! Visitors, this showcases our beautiful city perfectly!",

I did some research before I went to the place on what they have and we had a limited but still expansive menu. I got the Chilean Sea Bass and I must say I chose right. It was the best sea bass I've ever had. Cooked perfectly and we had a group of 40. That doesn't happen much with that amount of people. My desert was just as good. The chocolate raspberry drizzle cake was incredible. This is not a cheap place to eat. Expect a total of around 75 per plate I really would go with. If you want an incredible dinning experience you should check this place out",

    "text": "This is my second time here. Last one was two years ago with my boyfriend during our first year anniversary 2017. My first visit was almost magical, because it was September there was a light rain outside and we had a corner table making it more romantic.       But this review was for my visit yesterday. It was my boyfriend's birthday and our third year is next week. It was the usual good vibe that the place has. Tables are impeccable and our server Alec was the best. Very informative, knows the menu and the specials well. Our view is breathtaking since we got a window seat. And dining eight floors high overlooking the three rivers and the beautiful city of Pittsburgh will leave you breathless.        Now for the three stars. It is the food. I ordered the lemon sole Muniere and it didn't taste fresh. It seemed like a previously frozen filet. My boyfriend's son ordered the swordfish and I tasted it and it was exceptionally dry and chewy which means it was overcooked. We had a side of asparagus to share and that was that just asparagus. The only perfect entree we had was the birthday celebrants filet mignon. It was cooked to perfection and he was happy, which to me is all that matters. We were given a complimentary dessert of dark chocolate raspberry truffle cake and that was good too. But most upscale restaurants has this on their dessert menu.        I would come back though. And also would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a good view of the city while dining or would want a romantic evening with your SO. But not so much about the food. For their ostentatious price I expected more in the food department.",

    "text": "First time the husband and I have returned to Monterey Bay since we have been married, we last visited at least 10 years or so ago.    Upon entering the restaurant, everyone from the gentleman at the host station, to the waitress and manager knew we were there for our anniversary dinner.  We were given a spot one row back from the windows up on their balcony.  Which helped with joking dinner conversation later as we, native Pittsburghers, tried to identify the bridges we could see from our spots. (We're weird and you had to be there)  The view isn't the only draw for this restaurant, the food is absolutely phenomenal.  We started with the Oyster on the Half Shell.  You could only choose one variation so we chose the East Coast ones.  The waitress knew a bit about the makeup of them but seems kind of clueless when the husband started asking about the salinity of them.  Now we're not even as well versed as some but we do have decent experience with seafood restaurants and oysters.  So her lack of knowledge was a bit of a bummer.    First course and I had their Artisan Green Salad while the husband settled on the Caeser.  He was pleasantly surprised at their inclusion of whole anchovies, a touch many restaurants no longer do.  The berries and cheese in my salad helped with the seasonal taste and feel.  Quite exquisite.   The bread and butter were also very good, it having arrived to the table still steaming from the oven.  Nice touch there.   I was a bit overwhelmed when it came to picking a main for myself, seeing so many interesting fresh fish preparations listed.  Ultimately I landed on the classic Lemon Sole Meuniere. The husband ordered the Blackened Grouper, with a shareable side of Brussels Spouts.  Both fishes were prepared divinely, the grouper not overly blackened while the sole was delicate tasting.   When it came to dessert I was surprised that they were giving us one of whatever we wanted on the house to share.  After some heavy deliberations we settled on their Angel Food Cake Grilled Cheese.  It was like one of those dessert imposters, sweet and crispy angel food cake with cream cheese sandwiched inside of it. I can see why this dessert was voted best in Pittsburgh a few years back.   We will definitely be back for another special occasion in the future.",

    "text": "This place is a staple for fine dining in Pittsburgh . I usually go once or twice a year, for my or my significant others birthday.  This was just such an occasion, my 50th birthday.  Yuck!  We ordered the big eye tuna, sashimi style, and the shrimp linguini.  We also ordered the combo appetizer which has ichiban, shrimp and crab cakes. I've have the app a lot of times. It's usually very good.   Our entrees arrived fairly quickly. Her pasta and shrimp was good, nothing amazing, but good. My tuna was average at the very best.  You can go to Penn ave fish company and get tuna that's easily twice a good.  We also shared the baked carrots. They were nasty.  They looked nasty and tasted the same.  I would avoid them.  For desert, we ordered the angel food grilled cheese sandwich. It was amazing. It was really the best per of the meal.   The amazing combo appetizer never did arrive. I guess the waitress forgot to put the order in. Even though I gushed about how much I liked it for a good two minutes.   The only other comment I'll make is that the vibe of this place has changed.   The place looks a little less cool with the new renovations.  Plus it just seems to have lost its edge.   Hopefully they will get things sorted out. For now I can't give it my recommendation. Sorry peeps..",

    "text": "Wow. Just wow. This is arguably the best restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh. I am a seafood lover and everything was just perfect. Even before you get to the restaurant, the ride up in the elevator lets you take in the beautiful Pittsburgh city view.  Our waitress (who was extremely friendly and attentive) started us off with some warm bread and a cabernet butter with paprika on top. So good! The appetizer trio special they had last night sounded awesome, but we wanted to make sure we had room for dessert, so we went ahead and ordered our entrees and some wine.  The menu has a lot of different seafood options with different preparations. I wanted to try everything! I ended up getting the Chilean Seabass (Chimichurri) and my husband got the Halibut (Parmesan Crusted). I have no complaints whatsoever. The fish was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly and made both of our mouths water as we ate!  For sides, we ordered MB mac n cheese which had a ton of crab, scallops and shrimp in it. It definitely could have been a meal on its own. We also ordered the brussel sprouts. Even if you don't normally like brussel sprouts, you may like these. They were flash fried and seasoned with a sweet soy sauce, chili, orange and lime. Yum!! We definitely could have shared these sides with another couple of people. They were huge, but I was pretty excited to have leftovers since they were both so good!  Now for dessert. I saw the pics. I read the description. It didn't do it any justice. The Angel Food Grilled Cheese was amazing! It was everything I love in a dessert. It was light and sweet (but not too sweet), had fruit, almonds, vanilla bean icecream... AND, the \"grilled cheese\" itself had a creme brulee outer crust. So. Good. I also got a glass of Port to go with it, which was delicious (Fonseca 20 yr) and my husband got an Espresso Martini. I don't like coffee, but the martini was actually pretty good!  Overall, with the amazing view, delicious menu, and great service, I would highly recommend this restaurant. If you want to impress someone, bring them here and get a table by the window!",

I have an allergy to gluten, and she was very good at explaining what I could and could not eat and assuring me that the kitchen was experienced in ensuring that my food wouldn't be cross-contaminated.   The menu itself has the gluten free options very clearly marked, and as a surprise they even have fresh-baked gluten free bread that tastes delicious!   My brother and I both ordered cocktails, and they were very tasty. Our appetizers were excellent- the deviled eggs have ruined us for all other deviled eggs, and even though I couldn't eat it the rest of my family would just not shut up about how good the calamari was.   We all got different main courses; my mom had been gushing about how much she loved the crab cakes all day, and they more than lived up to her memory. My dad has the sea bass, my brother had the steelhead trout, and I got the 6oz. Lobster tail. Everything was delicious. We also split the sweet potato and asparagus sides, and everything was tender and perfectly cooked. My parents loved the croquettes, and I will forever be jealous that my allergy prevented me from stealing one from their plates.   By the time dessert came around, we were all stuffed. Our collective lack of impulse control was in control, and we ordered a creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake in a mug. The cake was delivered with a birthday candle, and even though we could barely move from all of the delicious food we'd already eaten, we just about finished both desserts.   All in all, it was a wonderful experience- it has a really nice atmosphere, and every employee we interacted with was great. Plus, there's just no beating that view.",

However, we have been here numerous times and it has steadily gone down hill.  Our last experience was disappointing.  My entree came out 10 minutes later than the other 4.  We had a vegan option - I will be quite blunt....horrible.  Lacked flavor and tasted like watered down sauce...only vegan option in the place.  Service was ok.  It is unfortunate because it is such a wonderful spot, but if you are a foodie and picky, there are better options to take in the view of Pittsburgh and get what you pay for.",

The restaurant itself is beautiful with all the natural light coming in from the huge windows. The wait staff was very polite and attentive. There was always someone coming by to top off our waters.  With all the delicious options it was very difficult to pick a entree. I ended up going with the chimichurri sea bass because it was recommended by my waitress. I was leaning towards the salmon but the sea bass was something different for me. We got the asparagus and potatoes as a shareable side. My sea bass was absolutely delicious. The chimichurri had just a little spice to it but it was also very refreshing. The sides were just mediocre in my opinion. Nothing special about basic potatoes or asparagus.  We typically don't do dessert because I'm usually taking home half my meal because I'm full. I surprisingly ate all of my meal and finished the sides so we figured why not celebrate. Everything on the dessert menu looked amazing but the waitress said the angel food grilled cheese was one of the best desserts in the burgh. Obviously we had to go for it if that was the case. After eating it I can totally understand why. It was by far one of the best desserts I've ever eaten. I might come back next week just for the dessert!",

    "text": "Let's me be clear, 3 stars is not because of the food or the service and this rating is based on this one visit.  Let's start with the good and great.  The food was nothing short of amazing.  The appetizers (we had both raw and grilled oysters), Kung Pao shrimp and beef sashimi), each better than the last.  We had  8 people at the table with different tastes and everything was a hit.  The She Crab soup was the best I ever had and unfortunately I had to share it with some others at the table after they asked for a taste.  Served table side and hot with delicious and delicate flavoring. Everyone was very happy with their entrees, which is tough to do when you have 8 people with different tastes.  The crab cakes were everything they claim them to be, as are the scallops.  There was a blue fin tuna special that night and it was superb.  Lastly, for a fish place, the best rib-eye you will ever have.  That is impressive.    The service was as good (or better) than the food.  Our waiter, Christian, should be asked for by name.  Siting in his section is a treat.  I love good food but good service trumps good food every time and this place has both. The bill will be expensive but know that going into it and you will be okay.  Expensive is worth it with that type of food and service.  Okay, so why only 3 stars? I went there for 1 reason and 1 reason only, the view.  It was my birthday and I made a reservation for 8 people and asked for a window seat.  We had family and friends from Florida and Philadelphia and I wanted to show off this beautiful city and view while we ate and celebrated.  When we got there, we were seated in the middle of the dining room (they call it one table in but we are in the middle), only to find out they do not have tables that accommodate 8 people at the window.  I can certainly understand this, you want to maximize the window view real estate, but they knew it was my birthday and I wanted to sit by a window when I made the reservation.  Shouldn't someone have told me we can't do 8 by the window??!!  I was very disappointed.  I can have a great dinner, great service and pay a fortune at a lot of really good Pittsburgh restaurants.  I could have gone to any of them but I choose Monterey Bay for the floor to ceiling windows and the view for my out of town family and friends.  I left bummed and unsure of my next visit.",

We also got the crab fat fried rice and could barely eat it. We sent it back and they did end up taking it off our bill. My boyfriend had the salmon, which was good but not too remarkable. Honestly, the more memorable part of our meal was the bread and butter. They had this champaign butter with the fresh bread that was amazing. The food wasn't bad, but for a higher end place at this price point we were a bit disappointed.",

I love Chilean sea bass, it's my favorite - but for some reason it wasn't great - it tasted a little overdone. Lobster Mac n cheese was good. Asparagus was forgettable as was the grilled wedge- I was hoping for a little more char to it - the dressing was good though.  Can't beat the view just wish the food matched how great the view was.  Service was good- a little stuffy but ok and the wine was great.  For it being a fish place I expected to be blown away with the sea bass but was sadly disappointed.",

FOOD - I have tried many fish dishes and almost all appetizers and I was never disappointed. However, I didnt really like their steaks. Also, their cocktails are all great(flavorful and not so strong). Oh and one thing I hated that I had was their lobster bisque. It was too salty, so we asked them if they could make it less salty, but we still couldnt eat it because it was way too salty.  SERVICE - I went there for my friends' bdays and my anniversary, and every time, they gave us free desserts with special writings on them. Also, servers frequently ask us if we need anything, and they are pretty quick and very friendly.  AMBIANCE - its a great place for big groups, couples, and families in special events.",

    "text": "I came here last night with my rents to celebrate my mom's birthday, and it was a disappointing experience overall! The view and service both get 5 stars, but the food was mediocre at best.    We started with two apps:  the Calamari & the Mussels (Limoncello style).  Both were \"eh\".  The Calamari was soggy and greasy, BUT the dipping sauces that accompanied the dish were tasty.  The mussels were ok - the flavor itself was actually unique and interesting, but the portion size was weak.  Huge shells with tiny morsels of meat inside *sad face*  Although our apps were weak, we had high hopes for our entrees.  I was stoked to get my Monterey style Cod (with artichoke hearts, tomato, garlic, green onion and muschrooms, sauteed in a Marsale wine sauce).    My dish was a serious mess.  There was absolutely no flavor, and my fish was severely overcooked.  I was pretty unhappy (understatement of the day).  I had to douse my food in tabasco to fork it down.  Sad times all around.  My parents ordered stuffed Scallops and crabcakes, and although their dishes were much better than mine, they weren't particularly impressed either.    Monterey Bay's supposed to be a legit seafood restaurant, but the only good food I had was the French Onion Soup and bread (which were both awesome).  I wish I could give this place a better rating because the waitstaff was amazing and the view was spectacular, but the food just wasn't up to par.",

The seasoning provided a nice tangy sweet citrusy kick to the fish. The atmosphere and preparation of the fish made me feel like I was on a tropical island somewhere. The peanut butter chocolate cheese cake was excellent. The cheesecake had pieces of pretzel baked inside which provided for an extra crunch.   I loved the view of the stadium and the city too. From our seat you could see the scoreboard at PNC park. The staff knows that the window seats are prime real estate and will work with you to get you a good seat if you have a reservation.   For people not familiar with the city, getting to the restaurant itself could be a bit of a challenge. We took the incline but there may have been a more efficient way. I would say it was worth the trip though!",

For starters we had a special combo platter that had swordfish and salmon skewers, lump crab cake (all crab, no fillers) and Cajun seasoned tiger prawn shrimp.  Great way to start a meal.  The service was superb too.  The only catch is that you get what you pay for and this place is definitely not inexpensive.  If you're thinking about going, plan to spend around $65-75 per person.",

    "text": "So my little brother graduated from Carnegie Melon this year and we booked a reservation here for afterwards.  Being my first time in Pittsburgh I was pretty excited to eat what my brother had chosen for his graduation dinner.  He later told me it was mostly for the view, he had never actually been there.  When we get to the place we start to park in the lot and the valet guy comes up to the car and tells us we have to check in at the valet in front of the restaurant.  We tried giving him our keys there but he told us to turn around and go back up front so as we did we see him running behind us to meet us at the front of the restaurant where he proceeded to then take our keys.  I guess he just wanted a quick sprint? lol.    Pittsburgh is DAMN COLD.  It was supposed to be sunny out, but it starts snowing during the graduation in May! For this reason, after we took the elevator \"All the way up\" (cue music), we opted to keep our coats instead of checking them in.  That lasted about 5 minutes, as the restaurant was nice and cozy, and we quickly got warm....What a view!!!! We were seated right away and pretty close to the window.  It had stopped raining and a rainbow had come out over the water.  Very beautiful.    I'm not big on cooked fish, I prefer my fish raw, but I opted for the Barramundi, which the waitress said was one of their specials that day.  It came with soup or salad so I asked for Lobster Bisque.  That Lobster Bisque and the angel food grilled cheese for dessert (more on that later) really stole the show for me.  All of the food was delicious, I had a little bit of fish off everyone's plate just to try out the flavors, but I don't think I'd be willing to pay that much money to eat those dishes again.  The crab cakes were definitely another highlight, and that's saying something because I don't usually enjoy crab cake, but again I'm not sure I would dish out the money to eat it again.  The flavor of the dessert, on the other hand, was completely unexpected, in a good way.  I would come back here just for the dessert and some coffee.  Not wine though, because each bottle of wine is ridiculously expensive.  My aunt said we were paying about $70 for a bottle of wine she had seen on a shelf at Albertsons in California for about $15 (not sure if she's right though).  But what the heck, we were celebrating my brothers graduation! So bring on 2 more bottles of wine!  All in all the food is good and the view is great.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  This restaurant is extremely expensive, but you are paying for the atmosphere and it doesn't hurt to try it at least once.",

    "text": "This restaurant is a must for all looking for a great meal in Pittsburgh. As a tourist, it is the perfect experience: exceptional view (you can go up the Dusquene Incline and being on Mount Washington you can see the three rivers of Pittsburgh), excellent food (fresh fish flown in daily), romantic atmosphere, and great service (attentive and friendly). Of course, this comes with a premium price, but worth the splurge on a special night out.  It is difficult to get a table during peak hours (especially on weekends), so I definitely recommend booking a reservation through OpenTable - which was hassle free. Ask for a table near the window upon arrival for a better view.  Although pricy, I found that the entree was filling enough to skip out on the appetizers. We tried the lobster bisque, it was quite good but a tad saltier than I would of liked, but have a strong lobster flavor to it.  What you MUST order: the dish that was the biggest hit was the MARYLAND CRAB CAKES. Probably the best I have eaten. Absolutely delicious. Second place goes to the grilled scallops - not the most flavorful I have eaten but you get 5 large pieces so it seems worth it.   By popular demand, I got the Chilean Sea Bass in Caribbean - it was good/buttery/prepared well but didn't really wow me for some reason. Personally thought the sauce was really good and does 'wet' my appetite, but overwhelmed the 'natural' taste of the fish. Yellow fin tuna was also ordered - unfortunately not my favourite as it had a steak-y taste and texture to it.  If you haven't been to Pittsburgh, I suggest this on your bucketlist.",

Good portion size too~   Then for my main course I ordered the New England clam chowder special... mmm~ bad choice.  It was clam chowder poured table-side over pork belly and one whole shell-in clam.  First of all, the table-side presentation might sound like a good idea, but when you have gritty yellowish clam chowder coming out of a tiny tea kettle spout... it's not that appetizing.  I decided to be open minded and try it~ and i get blech grits in my mouth.  Where's the creamy white clam chowder I expected?!  ugh~~ not cool.    I couldn't lie when the waitress asked me if I liked my meal, so she took it back and instead I got a steamed latte dessert!  Oh it made up for the nasty clam chowder~  It was a chocolate souffle topped with fresh whipped cream and a cute chocolate piece that looked like steam coming from the ginormous coffee cup.  The dessert and the amazing view from the restaurant saved me experience.  If it weren't for the clam chowder, I would've given it 4 stars.",

As an app my lovely boyrfiend, Ryan B, ordered the Ichiban - 2, yes only 2, skewers of various fish cooked in a terryaki liked glaze.  Not bad...overpriced at $14.  Next, the lobster bisque.  Biggest upset of the year 2010.  Well presented, bisque poured over a chunk of lobster claw - however, the soup was cold and more like Cambell's tomatoe with some chives in it.    Salads were next - loaded with way too much vinaigrette, a very Asian feel with crispy noodles and a gingery taste.  Ask for dressing on the side.  The bread is amazing, though!  Ryan's entree was a flash fried ahi steak, stuffed with spicy crabmeat and coated in penko.  Only one bite truly was spicy.  It was over a bed of rice - however, they called it couscous, and ONE head of bokchoy.  Also, a bit cold for my liking.  ($45!!! OMG)  I ordered red snapper prepared Oscar style stuffed with crabmeat.  Not bad at all!  Green beans on the side were delicious.  ($33, could have whipped this up at home for about $10.)  Sampled the calamari - very good, a great app for a group.  Crabcake was great too - but, best crabcake in Pittsburgh can be found at Willow in the North Hills!    I would recommend drinks and apps here with out of towners.  Know in advance it is a lot of money for a restaurant whose view does not compare with its food.",

My college student felt very pampered by the elegant atmosphere and the fabulous view, The food was impressive- we especially enjoyed the appetizers- the ahi tempura and the crabcakes were both standouts. The fresh fish choices were a bit overwhelming- too many choices! The salmon strawbery style came recommended by our server and was very good for an unexpected combination. We also tried the orange basil halibut which was very tasty (though my husband swore the fish was cod); the swordfish oscar was amazing; and the grouper monterey style with black olives and artichokes pleased my husband very much. Also enjoyed a side of lobster mac n cheese. We don't usually get desserts but they were all so tempting and made for a sweet conclusion to the meal. The service was attentive and overall it was a memorable if somewhat overindulgent dining experience!  Definitely recommend for a special occasion!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here for my birthday dinner last year when we were in Pittsburgh for the weekend. We chose it based on the glowing recommendation we received from the Maitre D' at our hotel.   It's in a pretty cool location atop Mount Washington which overlooks all of Pittsburgh. We took the incline plane most of the way up and then a cab from there which was nice. Once you arrive at the restaurant it kind of feels like being in an apartment building. You take an elevator up to the very top to enter the dining room.   My first impression of the dining room was that it is huge, crowded, and very early-90's in decor. I felt like I should have teased and sprayed my hair and given my bangs a nice blowout before I put on my shoulder-padded jean jacket to come to this restaurant. The lighting is cheesy, it's a mix of tables and booths, and I am almost positive there was a paper placemat on the table. Needless to say, Monterey Bay sort of felt like what my 6-year-old self always thought \"fancy restaurants\" were like until I actually was old enough to go to one.   Other reviewers don't lie, the view is amazing, but I have to admit it felt like the windows needed washing that night. It was a little hazy.   As for the food, it was priced like any fish restaurant--in the mid-$20's-$35 per plate. This is perhaps a personal chip on my shoulder, but I am never impressed by places that offer to butter-sautee or broil fish when that's not the ideal way for it to be prepared. It feels like a way to cater to not-so-savvy diners who don't really appreciate what good fish is. Our portions were ENORMOUS for everything which is annoying because I hate leaving fish uneaten, but it was just too much. It was prepared well, but our sides were pretty unrefined.   All in all, not a terrible dining experience, but I was not in love with it either. If you could do half-stars, this would get a 2.5 from me.",

Washington and walked to the restaurant during the evening and were fortunate it was a clear night with an incredible view of Pittsburgh while it was lit up with lights and a Pirates game in the background. The restaurant offers great views with an abundance of windows. I can't think there's a better view in all of Pittsburgh. The food also was delicious. The rockfish was fresh with excellent seasoning and I would also recommend trying the dessert menu, which offers some unique and delicious twists on traditional desserts. There are two negatives of note: first, where we sat they had tables for two that were arranged length-wise so you sit very far apart from each other--I think this was done to cram more tables into that particular area of the restaurant; second, once the waiter saw that we were only ordering less expensive entrees with no sides (which are priced individually), he was dismissive and perturbed and not interested in serving us. Otherwise, I would highly recommend as a required stop in Pittsburgh.",

Everything was ridiculously over priced but I paid it without complaint.   We ordered the appetizer platter and shared a bottle of wine while waiting for our other dining partners arrived.  The crab cakes were all that they were advertised to be and the sauce was creamy and delicious.   I had the Basil Garlic Yellow Snapper with rice pilaf for my entree and it was ok.

Went for a dinner with my girlfriend, and we arrived around 30 minutes past our reservation time, but they were very courteous about it. Our server was knowledgeable and courteous and made the night a very enjoyable experience.   All the food was amazing, but the crab cakes were ridiculous, so much so that I feel the need to comment. Usually I avoid crab cakes at restaurants, because you get some stringy crab meat mixed with bread mixed with generic mixed vegetables (read: defrosted peas, carrots, and corn), which has been the case even in fancy upscale restaurants. In fact, I only got the crab cake because it was part of the appetizer sampler. This turned out to be very fortunate for me, because the crab cake was huge chunks of tender, juicy lump crab meat, loosely held together, with nary a defrosted frozen vegetable in sight. Truly amazing.  The Irish coffee is a tad too strong for my liking; it was more like drinking shots with a bit of coffee rather than the other way around.  The view is the best in Pittsburgh. Make sure you get the side facing Heinz Field and downtown.  I would absolutely recommend it to everyone.",

    "text": "Yet another business dinner and yet another night of eating WAY too much food!  It's a rough life, I know.  Pity me...  One of THE most spectacular views of the city, bar none.  Most of the dining room has great/good views through the enormous windows, but I would even recommend the little bar downstairs for a drink and some great views.  Seemed to be not so well known, and a cheaper night than spending on the whole meal.  What can I say, the food was fantastic.  The Seared Ahi tuna was delicious with just the right amount of wasabi flavoring.  I ordered the salmon special on a cedar plank that was cooked and flavored absolutely right.  Even the steak was delicious according to some of my table-mates.  Wine list was generous (a bit pricey) but well complimenting the meals.  The serving staff was a touch slow, but it was nice not to feel rushed.  TIP:  Try their pretzel bread rolls.  They're delicious!  BIGGER TIP:  Not really sure about parking here, (I think there was valet service) but if you take a taxi there like we did, be prepared.  On a cold, snowy night we were waiting a good 45 minutes for a return taxi to the city.  Make sure to get your cab driver's number on the way over.  Give him an estimated time that you'll be done, and call him before dessert.  You'll save yourself a load of trouble.   Absolutely a place to take clients/business dinners.  A little pricey, but the food and atmosphere will definitely impress.  It's a little out of the way, but still only a 10 minute cab ride from the Convention Center",

First, the view on Grandview is beautiful! Regardless of the place you chose to eat at you will be blessed with a postcard worthy shot of the city. FYI - Directly across from the restaurant there's a little place with a historic write up and place to just sit and survey the city. Honestly I wasn't sure what to expect from the outside. It looked simply like an generic restaurant on an older hotel but we opted to go inside. The restaurant is at the top of the hotel. At street level there is a gorgeous view, so needless to say going up several more floors you are provided with an even more amazing view of the city. The main dining room was booked up so we ended up eating at the bar which was below the main dining room. The bar isn't as pretty as the dining room but we had a table right next to the window (something you can't generally get in the main dining room). The atmosphere was rather intimate - it was quiet and dimly lit - which was really nice. We were able to just relax, talk and take in that beautiful view. The service was excellent - our waitress left us alone but the minute I even thought I might want something she seemed to sense it and magically appeared. I ordered the salmon with the strawberry preparation. Again, I didn't know what to expect but the idea of strawberries paired with salmon intrigued me....... It was phenomenal!!!  I'm not sure how to describe it - the sauce was not sweet, nor did it taste especially like strawberries but it was incredibly yummy. My friend got this scallop and shrimp Alfredo pasta dish - the flavor was incredibly light. Most Alfredo dishes are so heavy and rich but this dish had a delicate flavor - not overwhelming - and the pasta was also this ruffled ribbon-like pasta instead of the traditional fettuccine. The prices are a little hefty ($30 for my salmon which just a fish and sauce) but the view, service and intriguing preparations really elevate this restaurant to that higher standard where I felt okay paying that much. I will be sure to come back during my future visits - even if it's just for a cocktail in the bar.",

One of my table mate's ordered Sushi grade tuna but for what ever reason chose to have it cooked well done or heated through. In my opinion that destroyed everything that makes sushi/sashimi food unique taste and mouth feel. He should have just ordered the blackened swordfish. My Scallops were awesome, cooked perfectly with not a bit of chewing gum style shellfish.",

    "text": "Wow. They have so many options (if you like seafood which i do!)   The menu of specials was overwhelming as well. The server rattled on for like 15 minutes about the specials which was impressive.   I am a scallop fan so I went with the crab stuffed scallops.  I was so overwhelmed by all of the fish options that I couldn't make up my mind.  The entree was delicious my only gripe is with the soup I ordered.  The server described the soup as a lobster butternut squash....sounds interesting and delicious. Unfortunately the soup was a overly sweet pumpkin puree.  I love soup but neither my sister or I could stomach it.   Obviously, the views are incredible but the interior seemed a little cheesy for a $30+ entree place.  Fake palm trees? hmm...   Pros: huge seafood menu, full bar, tasty bread, gorgeous views, actually kid friendly (for my nephew)   Cons: poor soup description, cheesy interior, a la carte vegetables, pricey but you are paying for the view.   Overall: I will be back for another special occasion!",

    "text": "Made reservations the day of to celebrate our wedding annivesary. Never having been to this restaurant before we we excited to experience the fresh seafood this establishment prepares. Our waiter Chad was excellent in his recommendations for appetizers, Maryland crab soup and pistachio, mandarin salad with goat cheese in a blood orange vinegarette. Very flavorful and would have been satisfied with these as our main entrees. He suggested the Chilean sea bass with macademia crusted topping and the grouper with the artichokes.,olives and mushrooms. Loved both of these dishes as they were extremely tasty and full  of flavor. Sea bass was our top choice. They also provided us with a free dessert for our annivesary, the angelfood cheese sandwich. We usually sway towards chocolate for desserts but wanted to try something different.  Best non chocolate  dessert  we ever had. Definitely  was worth the two hour drive to get here. Will come back after  they renovate in January. Palm tress are coming down. Can't wait to see the make over. Thanks  for a memorable evening  with the amazing view of the city !",

We ordered the filet mignon and the swordfish, which were both tasty. The sauteed zucchini and squash medley was a bit bland and disappointing. Angelfood grilled cheese for dessert is a must-try!  I actually liked the giant painted palm trees in the dining room (admittedly, they looked much better at night), but I do agree with other reviews that the decor needs updating. The rope lighting and blue neon lights around the bar have got to go. The place has an overall feeling of being outdated (and not in a classy, ironic way).",

    "text": "\"Monterey Bay Fish Sky Tower\"  This was an awesome way to continue our journey after riding the Duquesne Incline.  Just a short walk up the hill, take an elevator to the top and step off into a dining room with stunning panoramic views and vaulted ceilings.  The decor was slightly reminiscent of a Vegas hotel lobby.  It wasn't very busy when we got there but it was in between lunch and dinner hours.  We decided to go to the lounge area half a flight down.  We were the only ones sitting at the bar and got A+ service from our bartender.  He might have been one of the most engaging and entertaining bartenders I've ever met ( I feel terrible I cannot remember his name)  He truly appreciated the joys of being a mixologist and made some killer drinks.  The drink menu is extensive and we got their just in time for their 'Executive Hour\".  Okay, I giggled at first too and thought how pretentious, but it actually is quite clever since their clientele during this time was a lot of suits.  We must have tried 3 different drinks each, my favourite being the Jalepeno Martini.  Talk about a kick in the mouth!  The other drinks were incredibly tasty too and all used a variety of booze so their is something for anyone.   As the night progressed not only did the view become even more beautiful as Pittsburgh lit up we decided on a lil nosh.  So we tried the recommended Cajun Shrimp.  They were great and not too oily like other  places.  The rest of the menu looked like a \"To-Do list\" of fish.  Trust me you'll want to go back and check them off.  When we left the dining room was packed and a wait queued in the lobby.",

    "text": "I came here with my family on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  We spent about $120 for the four of us.  A lot of the cost is because of the view, and not necessarily the food.    There is a nice elevator ride up to the top of this hotel building.  They have some nice aquariums with bubbles rising for ambience, though I think the palm tree columns seem a little tacky.    The fresh bread they served was good.  However, service was slow.  The place was quite empty, and yet somehow we still had to wait for an hour for our food.    We started off with the crab cake and ichiban.  The crab cake had remoulade sauce and was very good.  The ichiban has several different fish.  The salmon was good, but it seems like some of the other fish were not cooked to the same consistency.    For the main course, my family had several different fish.  I had the Yellow Fin Tuna stuffed with spinach, mushrooms and goat cheese drizzled with a Marsala wine sauce (my waiter recommended it).  While the rest of my family seemed to like their Mahi Mahi for instance, my fish was a little dry and the vegetables inside seemed soggy.    Mediocre food, but come here primarily for its location and view.",

The views of the city are beautiful and it was nicely decorated for the holidays.  There is a kabob fish appetizer that is killer- I believe it was called Ichiban. Amazing. I never saw the wine list as his dad ordered, but both bottles we got were great!  Everyone got a different fish prepared in a different manner. I got scallops with a lobster sauce. It was tasty but SO SALTY, which is why I cannot give 5 stars. Everyone else's meal was really good. The dessert was also amazing! I had the creme brulee which was fantastic, and my boyfriend's mom got a bailey's cookie cheesecake which I could've eaten 5 of!   Our waiter was SUPER duper attentive- almost annoyingly so, but I know he had good intentions! lol. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and great Saturday night treat. It was pricey, but worth it for a special occasion!",

You usually can't request window seating because it's first come first serve, but when we arrived they said they heard my request and sat us at a window table and told me happy birthday. The waitress took our picture with the skyline in the background and was very polite about answering our questions about the city. We ordered oysters and the crab cakes as an appetizer. For the main dishes we ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with the Chimichurri prep, the Salmon with the honey lime prep, and the Rock Fish with the Parmesan prep. We ordered the Asparagus, Lobster Mac and Cheese, and Roasted Potatoes as sharable sides.  I tasted all of it and it was all so delicious! As a birthday gift they gave us a free dessert of my choice. I selected their award winning Angel Food Grilled Cheese Sandwich. Easily one of the best desserts I ever had! Definitely a great choice for a birthday/ welcome to Pitt dinner with loved ones!",

I would give the restaurant five stars on food and view alone but the place just feels so outdated and needs a face lift.  The giant bubbly fish tank when you walk in, the faux palm trees on the ceiling, the dark and dingy entrance way before you take the elevator up....  but on to the positives.  I went here for lunch and it wasn't crowded at all so we got a great window seat.  I ordered the rodi grille salmon with a side of green beans in a sweet chili sauce.  The salmon comes in a teriyaki sauce and was grilled to perfection.  I also ordered a glass of the Riesling and it was on the sweeter side but really good.  For dessert, I opted for the birthday cake cheesecake and it went beyond my expectations.  If you don't have a sweet tooth then this dessert isn't for you because I'm pretty sure I got a sugar high.  It was a cheesecake with birthday cake layers.  The icing was delicious and it looked a bit like a mini confetti birthday cake.  YUM!  I also sampled the crab cakes that my coworker ordered, which they are known for.  Fabulous.  All in all, good experience although I'll issue fair warning that it's a pricey meal even if you opt out of wine and dessert.  Good service, awesome food, I just can't get past that awful outdated 80s decor.....",

When we arrived all tables by the window were taken and I must say the lady at the entrance was not very welcoming which put me off at first  . We were then shown to our table and were introduced to our server Andrew , who I must say by far is the best server I have ever had the unique experience of meeting. He rearranged our table so we face the windows and have a fabulous view of the city. He then helped us with our menu selections and made excellent suggestions and finally served us our dessert. The food was good very well prepared I had the honey lime salmon which might have been cooked a bit too rare for my taste but still was good. My fiance had the paramesan halibut which was phenomenal. We had Creme brulee for dessert which was delicious and came with a very moist buttery sugar cookie on top. Our experience overall was great and made superb by this very nice man Andrew. It is the little things he did and the little details he tailored do that made the night so enjoyable. We enjoyed chatting with him between courses and he genuinely turned the night around. Should we visit Pittsburgh again we would definitely come back and ask for Andrew. Everyone should ask for Andrew !!!",

    "text": "This was the one fancy restaurant I had planned for our trip to Pittsburgh and my buddy made all the arrangements for everyone. Pros first.. cons later.  Reservations are highly recommended! FYI, we were seated immediately upon our arrival.  So here goes with the pros:  If I could make a comparison, I'd say this is the Pittsburgh version of Atlanta's Sun Dial in the sense that you get an AMAZING view of downtown (minus the nauseating rotation). Luck was on our side and we got the best table in the house. Often times, a corner table wouldn't be considered ideal, but it is when you've got floor to ceiling windows that open up to two phenomenally beautiful (and almost completely different) views right as the sun was setting, the sky began to darken, and the buildings were beginning to light up.  To start, the gentlemen all ordered stiff drinks while we waited for our complimentary bread basket. One of my friends went ahead and ordered a wine for his entree and asked the waitress for a good pairing. She then brought out a couple of tastings for him until he found one he liked.  We ordered the combination appetizer (not available on the menu - ask for it!) with jumbo Cajun shrimp, crab cake, and Ichiban (tuna, salmon, and swordfish grilled on a skewer). It was unanimous that the crab cake was the star, for it was almost completely jumbo lump crab and no filler. A hint of lemon would be my only suggestion for it.  As for entrees, we had a TOUGH time choosing. All their fish are caught fresh and flown in the same day and the menu offerings are slightly different depending on what is caught. If there's a fish they don't have that day, their menu will reflect so with an \"NA\" but they like to leave it on in case you want to come back to try it in the future. The preparation options below each fish choice are their recommendations, but you can actually choose any preparation with any fish at no additional cost except for the \"oscar\" option. -Enter.. my strawberry prep Chilean Sea Bass -- Chargrilled, finished with fresh peppered strawberries in a red wine sauce. The men were jealous, yes.. jealous of my fruity concoction and voted it best dish at the table.  -Beau ordered the Swordfish Oscar and it was perfect for him. Swordfish is very dense and it was nicely grilled, so it had a very woody / manly taste to it hahaha.  -You can never go wrong with surf and turf (also not on the menu, so you should ask for it): filet mignon, a large lobster tail, and cheddar whipped potatoes. My friend said all the food was great but the filet mignon was best of all and cooked to the perfect medium rare. -Parmesan Chilean Sea Bass was the last of 'em. My friend enjoyed it, but all the cheese is very filling and he couldn't finish his meal, especially with the sides we chose. -Sides are meant to share here, so we went with the lobster mac and cheese and the seasonal vegetables.  We shared two desserts - a lavender creme brulee and a white chocolate macadamia mousse. I'd skip on the creme brulee unless they have a different flavor. The lavender seriously made it feel like we were eating an air freshener. The mousse looked unappealing because it looked like two mounds of mashed potatoes. But looks can be deceiving, as I learned through the entire dessert round. Heaven.. in.. your.. mouth. Seriously! You must order it.  The presentation for everything was very appealing and well thought out. Portion sizes were very generous, with our fish entrees taking up most of our dinner plates.  You will not leave here hungry, folks.  Service was wonderful. Our waitress was incredibly patient, explained the menu, offered her personal suggestions, and answered all the questions we had. Our drinks were refilled quickly, under the watchful eyes of the water guys. The manager even came over personally to ask how our dinner was and if there was anything they could do to make our dining experience even better (to which we said no).   They offer valet service for a fee. I'm not sure what it was because we opted to park one street over for free.  After all that's said and done.. what could I possibly have to say that is less than radiant?  - My buddy told me he got a LOT of grief for changing the reservation from 3 people to 4. I understand how it might be a hassle to change a reservation from 4 to 5 since all the tables sat 2 and were pushed together to accommodate more. -We were promised our complimentary bread basket but it took a very long time for it to arrive; even the waitress thought so, too. We were starving and drinking on empty stomachs. -You ride an elevator up to the restaurant and there's a bit of a wait, since there's a small limit as to how many people can be inside at one time. Going down was much quicker.  Perfect for a romantic evening or when you're in your fancy schmancy mood and want to get dressed up to eat something delicious. Hey, anywhere they use a comb brush to clean the table is entitled to using the term \"fancy schmancy\" okay?",

The prices are too. The menu is comprehensive (assuming you're here for fish). The decor is totally Miami 80s...complete with a large, lit water tank with bubbles and if memory serves me correctly, jungle leaf motifs all over the carpet. For the prices, you would think they would update the decor. Whatever...onto the food!  The crab cakes are all crab, no filler, and completely delicious. The oysters were totally disappointing. We had better oysters that afternoon at the shadyside market than we did at Monterey...and the shadyside ones cost $1 a pop. All the fish dishes were good. My macadamia encrusted halibut was delicious. The vegetable sides were totally disappointing and appeared to have little thought or effort put into them. I understand if they were going for simple and fresh, but even if that was their intent they missed the mark. They were bland and uninspired. The salads were good and the desserts were good, but not to die for. The fancier cocktails were good to meh.  Our waiter was wonderful. He was a great fine dining waiter with all the bells and whistles, yet he was not stuffy or condescending. He knew how to relax and help his table relax. He made our dining experience great.",

    "text": "My friend brought me here to celebrate earning my masters degree and a major birthday.  We had a reservation for 5:30 and got the last window table.  You cannot reserve a window table specifically, FYI.  The view here is definitely amazing.  You will be lucky to walk out of here for less than $100/person, but you are definitely paying for the atmosphere as well as good food.  We started out with the Seared Kobe ($25) and a sampler platter that had Ichiban, crab cake, and something else.  The platter was delicious, and we especially loved the crab cake and ichiban.  The seared Kobe was not really my thing.  It is a cold, tender, fatty beef, and while the quality was good, it was too salty for my taste.  The meal also starts with fresh bread and a delicious chive butter that was amazing.  I regret not eating more of the bread.  I ordered the stuffed shrimp ($32) for dinner.  It was four shrimp with plenty of crab and tasted really delicious.  It was one of the best stuffed shrimp meals I have ever eaten.  Sadly, our server was SO rude throughout dinner, and I have no idea what her problem was.  She tried to rush us through the entire meal.  Our appetizer came out 5 minutes after we ordered it, and the entrees about 10 minutes after the appetizer.  When the food came out, it wasn't hot, and we didn't have time to eat it before it got cold.  The server never came back to the table so we asked a manager to heat it up.  He ended up having it remade, which was above and beyond what I expected.  But after he did that, she was even ruder throughout our meal.  It was fairly off-putting.  Luckily, the guy refilling the waters was a gem.  The manager did a great job as well and was really nice, but the server was just inappropriate for this kind of place.  All in all, aside from our weird server, this is a nice place to come for a celebratory dinner.",

We got the calamari as an appetizer, which was just fried enough to have a good breading, but still enough of a calamari chew that you lost that flavor.  For our entrees, we got the Jumbo Scallops and the Swordfish (parmesan style).  I wasn't sure how you could stuff scallops, but they were just cut in the middle, and stuffed with Monterey Bay's famous crab cake.  Both were seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The parmesan crust on the swordfish was perfectly crispy and the fish was cooked to melt in your mouth, truly \"the filet mignon of the sea.\"  After eating bread, the app, and our entrees, we both were very full and satisfied, when usually I'm left not feeling overly full after eating seafood.  Highly recommended for any special event or just a nice night out.  The price is worth way more than just the view, the entire experience was unforgettable!",

We were lucky enough to get window seating and UGH it was amazing. My two favorite things in the world: views and wine. The food wasn't the best, but everything else made up for it.  Ordered: x ROCKFISH (parmesan coated, lemon peppercorn cream sauce) - yummyyyy. I love fish and this was so different than what I'm used to eating.  x GRILLED WEDGE (baby iceberg, smoked blue cheese, pickled red onions, pancetta, sriracha red peppers) - A little too much dressing for my liking, but wedge salads are my favorite! I always feels like its extra fresh. x Brussel Sprouts - Too mushy, but the flavors were AMAZING!! Brussel sprouts are one of my favorite veggies :0) x ANGEL FOOD GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH (caramelized angel food cake, cream cheese filling, seasonal berry compote, vanilla ice cream, toasted sweet and salty almonds) - I'm not the biggest fan of desserts, especially in restaurants as I prefer to devour a box of chocolates instead... but this was super yummy! I love angel food cake! We shared and still did finish it.  Cute date night spot. We took the trolly up and it made the experience that much better :0)",

We decided to try out Monterey Bay and I'm so glad we did. We arrived 45 minutes early hoping to just sit at the bar for a few cocktails before dinner. Our table was ready when we arrived so we were able to eat earlier than planned. Our waitress, Casey, was excellent. Very knowledgeable about the menu and assisted me in my dinner indecisiveness. She did not steer my wrong! We had the appetizer special, the seafood trio, and it was mouth watering. The lobster ravioli was to die for - not thick and creamy like you would expect. LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! I promise you won't be disappointed. The angel food cake grilled cheese has been voted the best dessert in Pittsburgh twice now (fun fact by our waitress Casey) and now I know why.   Definitely a must try with a breath taking view of the city.",

And it tastes like it's right out of the ocean. Pricey, but let's be honest, how can you put a price on the delicate, flakey jumbo lump crab cakes?   The view is second to none.

Gone are all the 1980's Miami Vice retro themed palm trees and the Sunset Boulevard themed colors.  This place is cool & hip with a friendly vibe and even their own sushi counter.  We were here with a local Happy Hour group that had arranged, ala Yelp style, for a cocktail & appetizer sampling and we were IMPRESSED!    I'll spare you the 'intro' & 'outro' comps and get straight to their appetizer samplings.  The first and the biggest hit of the night were the Ichiban skewers.  They were a combo of marinated & chargrilled tuna, salmon & swordfish with an ancho-chili aioli drizzle.  There was a delicious Ceviche Roll which consisted of Oro King Salmon, apple, jalapeno peppers, red onion, red,yellow & green peppers with a topping of spicy mayo.  Then there was the Beef Tartar made up of Kobe beef, truffle oil, scallions and hard boiled egg over a fresh crostini.  last offering was a veggie roll for those in the group that were vegetarian.  There was a nice write-up of what was in those, but I'm not vegetarian so I didn't copy it down.  ;)  They had the bartenders create 3 specialty drinks for our group with a $5 price tag that made it feel like we were practically stealing them.  The first one was the Pittsburgh Aviator made up of Beefeater Gin, Luxardo Maraschino and creme Yvette.  The second was a Three Rivers Smash made up of Woodford Rye whiskey, fresh mint and fresh lemon.  The last was a Strawberry Basil Pepino consisting of Hornitos Tequila, fresh lime, fresh strawberries and a jalapeno twist.  The last was MY favorite.  My adventurous wife prefers her cocktails served in a chilled long neck.  ;)   This is not someplace I could afford to come to on a regular basis and that's ok.  But sometimes you gotta treat yourself and the next time I want to do that, I'm coming back...!",

However, I was glad to find out that I was quite wrong, and I was more than pleased with the food that arrived at my table. The fish was phenomenal and tasted very, very fresh. For dessert, we split the angel food grilled cheese sandwich which was so beautifully presented, and it tasted just as good as it sounds!  Our reservations were at sunset so the view before, during, and after sunset were unlike any other in the city. It was such a fun spot to go to celebrate an anniversary or a special occasion!  The only drawback with this restaurant is the price tag, but you won't find a better seafood restaurant with such an incredible view in Pittsburgh!",

We were 30 minutes early, unsure of how long it would take to get to the incline and up to the top so they had us wait in the bar until our table was ready.  The bar has a great view of the city too, and it took only about 10 minutes for them to get our table ready.   The service was very good, however, our table was in an awkward spot.  There were two tables with large parties behind us, so they had expanded those tables making the waiters and waitress' jobs difficult, often squeezing between my chair and the chair behind me.  It seemed like our table could have been moved to accommodate the large parties and the service lanes needed.  (the first chair I sat in also had a nail sticking out, but since there were 4 chairs and only 3 of us, i switched chairs and let our server know).   We had the Ichiban, crab cakes and jumbo shrimp for a starter and all were delicious. We all had different kinds of fish ( salmon, rockfish, halibut) which were great.  The salmon was good, but I like it more well done and it was rare in the middle.    For desert, we had the chocolate latte cake (which may be one of my favorite deserts ever) and the key lime tarte.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone for a fancy dinner, with a beautiful view.",

Today I get a call asking about my confirmation for our reservation tomorrow. TOMORROW?? No I don't need reservations for tomorrow I needed it for Valentine's Day. This is why we purposely reserved a month in advance so we wouldn't be in this situation. When I called all they could say is we can't help you there's no more redactions for that day. Well obviously because we're a week before Valentine's Day and every other place I had in mind is booked too. So I just want to say thank you for screwing me over and make sure you check the dates when you book!!",

Who knew? 2 locals on the strip recommended this restaurant when I asked where we should eat atop Mount Washington. They both stated Monterey Bay Fish Grotto.  The drinks were excellent, as was the ambiance. The view was amazing and we weren't even by the window, but elevated to where we could see everything. Incredible! The appetizer was to die for, and the meal itself was superb! I had the parmesan crusted swordfish, my husband had the crabcake with sea scallops, and our daughter had the crabcakes. All were cooked to perfection and plated beautifully. Our server knew what she was talking about and was very helpful in our selections. For dessert, we shared creme brulee and the angel food grilled cheese. Oh my word, talk about delicious! If you don't eat anywhere else in Pittsburgh, this is THE place to try!",

Our server, Holly, was pleasant as can be and very efficient. I ordered the swordfish with cajun seasoning and orange marmalade sauce and my fiance had caribbean halibut. We both agreed that while both were delicious the swordfish was the better meal. It was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. We shared a side of lobster mac and cheese. It was good, probably could have cut back on the cheese a tiny bit as it was super rich. Now, we opted against dessert because I was pretty full, but when she brought us our check, Holly also brought a piece of the angel food grilled cheese to go because we were celebrating. Very sweet gesture and we tore into it as soon as we got home! Such an innovative and delicious dessert!",

It was gorgeous and definitely one of the best views I've seen of Pittsburgh, especially at night. This is the place to go to for an amazing view.   The food, however, was just okay, from the calamari to the sushi rolls to the dessert. We tried the Cathedral roll, Carson St. roll, and 446 roll. The best was the 446, which came in 11 pieces and had shrimp tempura, spicy salmon, eel, and avocado. We thought the other two were eh, okay. Dessert was the apple tart--good, but didn't blow us away or anything.   Service was very good! Our server seemed to really care about us, and the manager went around introducing himself to tables, chatted a bit, and came back to check up after we got our food. And--I have to say it again--the view is one of the best you'll get of Pittsburgh. Come here for the service and view, but there are definitely a few disappointments on the menu. I would say still worth the trip though!   Taste | 3 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3 Service | 4 OVERALL | 3.5",

My friends and I got a window table and were able to see the beautiful Pittsburgh skyline while eating dinner. We ordered the Brandied shrimp tagliatelle, Moroccan spiced eggplant, Monterey Bay signature crab cakes, Halibut with Parmesan crust, and the Lobster mac and cheese. The tagliatelle dish was amazing. The noodles were chewy and the sauce was perfectly balanced with the shrimp. I've honestly never seen shrimp that huge in my life, esp in a pasta dish! They are most famous for their crab cakes, and I can definitely see why. They were soft and flavorful. There was some sauce on the bottom of them, but definitely was not necessary. We also ordered two desserts- Angel food grilled cheese sandwich and the maple tiramisu. We had a hard time deciding which desserts to get and almost ordered every single one on the menu! To be honest, I think the prices are a little cheaper than other seafood restaurants I've been to, but the quality of food definitely surpassed the price.",

    "text": "As anyone who reads my reviews knows, I do not care for seafood.  But, on occasion, I find myself at a seafood restaurant and am usually OK with that because a lot of seafood places, at least the good ones, have alternatives to seafood for those diners who don't love it.  Like me.  We came here as part of a party, celebrating my sister-in-law's birthday- she and her fiancee (and most of the party-goers) hail from Morgantown, WV but apparently this place is so good as to warrant a 1.5 hour (one-way) road trip to experience.  In retrospect, it was worth it.  At first look, I got the impression that this wasn't going to be some ordinary restaurant.  It sits high above Three Rivers with a gorgeous view of downtown Pittsburgh- which was the first I'd ever seen of it, having never been to Pittsburgh before.  At night, it is positively beautiful, all lit up like cities usually are.  The restaurant itself is on the top floor(s) of a building sitting above the riverfront, access is past a guard's desk and onto the elevator.  Once the doors opened, you are treated to a frontal view of the restaurant, the hostess is right there.  The restaurant is multi-level; the upper level is the main dining area, with floor-to-ceiling windows offering a marvelous view of the waterfront.  There were tables of all sizes, we were sat at a long table close to those front windows.  The lower area appear to be private dining rooms, the rest room is also located down a flight of stairs just behind the hostess area.  Everyone working there was very polite, friendly and professional.  Wait staff were eager- from recommendations on food to the intricacies of the special cocktails offered from the bar, all requests were handled good-naturedly and with aplomb.  We started off with a round of drinks and a few appetizers, none of which I ate as they were all of the sea-variety.  Or cheesy.  The knight doesn't like cheese, either.  But I digress...  As luck would have it, they had a couple of steaks on the menu, so I opted for the filet.  As far as I'm concerned, every steak I eat is considered against the fine cuts at Stoney River in Annapolis, and with that in mind I will say this- it was a good steak.  Really good; tender, juicy - some places don't believe in seasoning meat and this is one of those places.  I like my steaks seasoned and seared, but that's just personal preference.  It was better than some I've had in other so-called steakhouses and that's saying quite a bit for a place that specializes in fresh seafood.  I ordered fried potatoes and a salad with my entree and I know I should've paid more attention to what the other diners had but, well, it was a party so I may not have been at my most...observant.  Everything that came out was attractive, plated to please the eye, not just the stomach and everyone raved about their food so I assume it was quite good.  Few if any doggie bags to return with us.    We pretty much closed the place as we were a little late arriving to begin with; the staff remained courteous and friendly and saw us onto the elevator.  The security guards looked ready to go but wished us a good evening nonetheless.  The party bus pulled up and we were on our way back to WV, sated and satisfied.  While I don't see me traveling to Pittsburgh for any reason on my own, if I did- I'd probably look to dine here again.  It isn't a cheap, or budget-friendly restaurant by any stretch of the imagination but you do get what you pay for.  For seafood lovers, it is worth at least one visit!",

    "text": "It's my 500th review! What better way to commemorate that than with a 5-star review?  For my xxth birthday (after all, you're never supposed to ask a woman her age. I'll leave the actual number up to your imagination), my boyfriend took me here for dinner. It's right up the Duquesne incline so if you're sitting by the window, you'll get an amazing view of Pittsburgh.  Everything from the beginning to the end was fantastic. Our waiter (I wish I could remember his name but I did have a few birthday drinks that night after all) was really attentive and nice - he even helped us snap a few pictures at the end of the night, even though I'm sure he was super busy.  For my entree, I went with the parmesan rockfish (Parmesan coated with lemon peppercorn cream). It was amazing. The cream sauce wasn't too heavy, which is something hard to find when ordering something with a cream sauce.  My boyfriend had the chimichurri swordfish (cilantro, basil, chile lime sauce), which tasted really refreshing. It would have went really well with a side salad.  None of the fish dishes come with sides, so we decided to get the lobster crab mac and cheese to share. This came out piping hot and cheesy, and you could actually taste the chunks of shellfish.  We ended up eating a little bit of everything and we were stuffed. To top it all off, they gave us a complimentary birthday dessert (anything from the dessert menu). I chose this pineapple cake thing which was pretty good, and not overly sweet. We also ordered the angel food grilled cheese sandwich, which our waiter said was their most popular. It's caramel iced Angel food cake, cream cheese filling, berry compote, vanilla ice cream, and toasted almonds. This was a little too sweet for me but the vanilla ice cream definitely helped balance it out a bit.  We ate our leftover fish the next day and it still tasted great - not something you can say too often about day-old microwaved fish.  Who knew you could get such fresh seafood in Pittsburgh?! Would definitely recommend if you're in town and are looking for dinner with a view.",

    "text": "Even though I didn't give this place 5 stars, it's still really good!!! The fish is so clearly fresh and the preparations are great. For fish lovers, the less you do is more. The chef really does seem to realize that. The chef uses earthy whole ingredients that work really well. I had the Chilean Sea Bass and my husband had the halibut. We both loved our dishes. For an appetizer we had the sampler that included crab cakes, fish skewer, and shrimp. All Sooooo good! The crab cake had so much crab! The sauces everything was paired with was perfect! For dessert we had the steamed chocolate latte. It was so creative and cute and it tasted fantastic! We devoured the whole thing!!!   Now onto why I to why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5. At this price point, I think a stronger critique is more informative. In my opinion, the chef really knows what they are doing with the fish and the sauces, so I wish they would make full entrees. At steakhouses I understand doing sides family style, but I was hoping the chef would prepare a great side that would pair nicely with the fish and sauces. Perhaps other people might prefer a la carte sides, but I prefer the chef to pick it if they know what they are doing and this chef really does! We got tricolor potatoes which were really good. We also got flash fried Brussels sprouts, which were a little greasy. I thought they'd be nice and crunchy, but they were more soggy with grease.  All in all I will definitely go back next time we are in town, but they can stand to improve a few things to make this place perfect!! Oh and service was really good as well. They didn't bother us too much but they were attentive. Definitely the best seafood restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh and possibly ever!",

    "text": "***This review is for the angel food grilled cheese sandwich--I enjoyed dessert but not a full meal here.***  During the five years that I lived in Pittsburgh, I rarely made it up to Mt. Washington.  Because of the stunning views, however, I made sure that my last meal in PGH was there.  I was able to try not one but *two* of the high-end restaurants on the Duquesne Heights side, and Monterey Bay Fish Grotto was one of them.  Having heard that the angel food grilled cheese was reputed to be the best restaurant dessert in PGH, and given that I have a serious sweet tooth (hence my Bakery Queen status), I knew I needed to try it before I flew the coop for good.  Although my dining partner and I were quite full from dinner, a hearty walk on the trail leading down--and subsequently up--the mountain freed up some precious stomach real estate.  I asked my dining partner if we could get dessert at Monterey Bay so I could try the angel food grilled cheese and he agreed, so we ascended the elevator and took a seat in the lounge by the bar.  When we asked for a dessert menu, our waitress explained that the angel food grilled cheese ($10) was their signature dessert, but I required no convincing because I'd already done my research, as usual.  When it came, it looked exactly as the photos of it I'd seen had led me to believe that it would look--beautifully plated and scrumptious!  The pound cake bread was bruleed (toasted?) using a blowtorch, just like a creme brulee, and its warmth and softness complemented the cooler, creamy sweetened cream cheese interior.  It was served with a flavorful berry compote that was well-balanced in its sweet-tartness, as well as a scoop of vanilla ice cream that provided a chilled, creamy foil.  The entire dish was sprinkled with toasted almond slivers, and was garnished by a sprig of fresh mint leaves.  The variety of flavors and textures was everything I'd hoped for--and more!  The variations in sweetness between the different components, as well as the textures ranging from soft and airy to smooth and creamy to light and crunchy, made every bite fascinating.  Without a doubt, I agree that it's easily the best restaurant dessert in PGH, and it rivals Prantl's burnt as PGH's most unique and delicious dessert.  My dining partner ordered the chocolate torte ($9), which also had a nice variety of flavors and textures, though it wasn't nearly as extensive.  It reminded me of a similar dessert I had at Bartram House Bakery near the South Side Works, but the ingredients and overall product were superior in quality.  If you're a diehard fan of dark chocolate and can't fathom the idea of a dessert without chocolate, it's worth a try.  If you're adventurous like me, however, get the angel food grilled cheese and don't look back!  As I'd expect at a restaurant of this caliber, service was knowledgeable and attentive yet unobtrusive, and had the class not to play hooky (no pun intended!) upon learning we were dessert only customers.  Aside from the food and service, the obvious selling point is the view, which was quite unique from our vantage point.  From where we were seated, we had an unobstructed view of both the front and back of the mountain, which was quite unique and special.  Looking out at the twinkling lights of the city skyline one last time from my comfortable chair while enjoying a unique and delicious dessert, for a few magical moments, I felt like a high roller rather than a lowly postdoctoral researcher, endowing me with a special lasting memory of my final evening as a resident of Pittsburgh.",

I had the Crab Cakes that are perfectly cooked and oh so good.   Everyone really enjoyed their meal. We shared a couple of the sides.  Brussel sprouts and asparagus were good but not as good as mine.  The Lobster Mac was a big hit.  Some nice pieces of lobster were evident. For desert we shared a couple including the Passion Fruit rose Icebox Pie and the Steaming Chocolate latte.  Really enjoyed the Passion Fruit.  The Steaming Chocolate is definitely a chocolate lovers dream.   When we arrived the hostess made sure to congratulate the person who we were celebrating but was surprised they were not offered or given a small desert or something as does another restaurant just down the street always does.",

All the men in our group wore slacks and a button down with a suit-jacket, and all the women were either in nice (but casual) dresses, or dress pants. Our waiter was certainly knowledgeable, about both food and drinks.  We started with a seafood appetizer trio (crab cake, sashimi, Cajun shrimp) that was all excellent. The shrimp particularly had a strong (and a little spicy) flavor. We also had the oysters and bread. The butter was definitely a hit at the table.  For the main course, I ordered the sesame tuna. They give you sizable portions, maybe even a little too large (at least for me, after all the appetizers). Not much on the tuna, so the flavor of the fish certainly comes out.  For dessert, I had the pot de creme. The vanilla flavor came out beautifully, and the biscuit and berries that came out with it paired well. My partner ordered the rhubarb strudel, with two large pieces -couldn't finish it. That said, the flavor was great and there a little brulee action on the bottom that gave the strudel a nice crunch.   This would be a great place for a special event. Probably a little over-priced, but the view truly is worth it, and overall, the food was excellent!",

    "text": "An unimpressive experience. My date made reservations for 8:30 PM on a Friday night. Now you would have thought they'd have their best servers. Wrong! The food was very good, except for the bisque. Very little crab meat and not a tasty broth to spoon into after all the meat was gone, which only took two spoonfuls. They brought me more crab to add to the broth, again another two spoonfuls before that was gone too. The bisque itself was okay, not something I wanted to spend time sopping up. All the rest of the dinner was very tasty.  Now, the service...... They seated us at a table in a far corner. We waited 10 minutes for anyone to come over to our table. No one to even fill our water glasses. When I asked someone if I could get water, we were then asked if we wanted it by our waitress, who finally showed up, she then had to go get it.  She said she was going to bring bread for the table. Another 10 minutes and my date asked for more butter, which never came. We waited constantly for our waitress. I had to wave at her to come over so we could order appetizers and then had to wave down the floor manager to ask him to send our waitress over so we could order our main entrees .  I complained to the floor manager after we completed our meals he asked if there was anything he could get us, then offered dessert. Really? I didn't want dessert! I wanted an exceptional evening with a great guy at, what I thought was an exceptional restaurant.  They complimented the meals which was ok, but we can't get the evening back. We went there to relax, talk,  have some great food and not have to worry about such things.   I do have to say, that the valet were awesome and the bartenders were exceptional. My date ordered a drink he concocted himself and I ordered a dirty martini. Both were perfect!!!  Don't think I'd take a chance going again.",

That night was very easy to recall because there was a False alarm go off right after we got seated.  We went back to continue our dinner after things were clear.  Server, Jason, was nice and introduced himself.  However, his service was not so remarkable.  Didn't give us water until almost 20 minutes later.  I asked him to give me a taste of two different wine, he only brought one glass?!!!! Really? After I told him which one I liked, I waited forever for him to bring over the wine (it was busy at all btw).  Then soup was served, without spoon.... Main courses came, but he didn't clear the table first...  At the end, he gave us a check without asking me if I would like dessert.. SMH. I had dessert anyway.  I ended up tipping him 20% not because his service was good, just because I used to be a server, and I don't know how to tip less than that.   I just think, a nice high class restaurant like that should have trained the server better.  I was very disappointed.  Food was good but unfortunately I will not go back.",

We wanted to eat somewhere near the incline and there are a lot of options and Monterey Bay Fish Grotto seem like the perfect choice. We made reservations. When we arrived we had to take the elevator to the top floor. The elevator was a little slow. We were seated by the window that offered an amazing view of the city. The menu offered so many different types of fish. Finally we narrow it down and decided with the hawaii opah blackened Cajun and hawaii walu Caribbean. The blacken Cajun opah had a smoky taste and the texture of the fish was more rough. The Caribbean walu had a fruity taste and a much softer texture. Both fish were good but if I had to choose one, I would go with the Caribbean walu. I really enjoyed my meal here and it makes a great place for pictures as well.",

We ordered a sampler appetizer, two Chilean Sea Bass with Caribbean-Jerk spices with pineapple, red peppers and chives as well as a side of asparagus and red peppers.  Food: The sampler appetizer included 2 tiger shrimps, crab cake, and 5 bite size pieces of swordfish, salmon and tuna. - Chilled jumbo shrimps were fresh, bouncy and flavourful with the cocktail sauce. - Crab cake was fresh and soft with loads of crab meats instead of breadcrumbs.      *Best crab cake I ever had.  - Five bite size pieces of fresh swordfish, salmon and tuna taste very unique with the Ancho chili mayonnaise. -The Chilean Sea Bass was very tasty, soft, fresh and full of flavours. It's sweet with a hint of spicy jerk taste.   -Asparagus and red peppers side dish was delicious.  Atmosphere: It has a spectacular city night view and the atmosphere is very romantic and classy. I really like the palm trees decors. It's a great place to celebrate any kind of special occasion.  Service: Excellence service!! The waiter is very friendly and courteous. He's always on the roll of keeping our table spotlessly clean and our glass cups were never empty. Also the manager stopped by our table to ensure everything is going well.  Overall, this was a very memorable experience and one of the best highlight of my trip. Excellent quality of food and service! I'll be looking forward to my next trip to Pittsburgh for more delicious seafood food at Monterey Bay and hopefully we'll get the window seats.",

The food prices are expensive, but in line with what you would expect to pay for high end seafood. The prices for wine are another story. It's a nice wine list for sure, but the wine prices are just over the top. The majority of bottles on the list are over $100 per bottle. Most seem to be priced at 3-4x retail. For example, we paid $75 for a (nice) bottle of California Chardonnay that you can find in a liquor store for $20-24.  One other complaint. Having a glass elevator with a view of the city is a nice touch. But you might want to consider washing the glass...it's pretty dirty.",

I ordered the Stuffed Yellow Fin Tuna and my girlfriend ordered the Shrimp and Scallop fettuccine both were excellent.      However there was one thing better than the food and the view.  And that was the service.  Our Waitress, April was great.  She was friendly as could be and very knowledgeable of the menu and made great recommendations.      Overall I was very satisfied with Monterey and will without a doubt return in the future.",

There were a few mishaps with the meal, but if there was ever a way to salvage a mistake, MB did it with flying colors.  The management handled everything perfectly.  But the real applause goes to Jessica, who works in the lounge.  She is on her game, knows how to treat a customer, and, well, is VERY easy on the eyes...  She's the reason I'll definitely be going back.  Great food, great view, and amazing customer service.",

However, Monterey Bay is THE BEST place to get seafood in Pittsburgh. Come prepared to spend money, because good fish in Pittsburgh is not cheap.

My husband and I dined at Monterey Bay on a recent trip to Pittsburgh to see family.  Though I wouldn't have chosen Monterey Bay myself after reading online reviews, I was happy to be at the restaurant to enjoy the view.  The welcome by the staff and the ambiance at the restaurant are a great way to start a meal.  Unfortunately, it was all down hill from there.  Our meals lacked creativity and balance, but they were abundant in salt.   Even the butter for the bread was salted almost too much!   I had a special soup- it was way too mushroom-y and almost inedible because of the salt content. Another person had shrimp scampi; it was a pound of pasta and about 6-8 shrimp.  It was tasty, but totally unbalanced.   As a meal I had an appetizer- the Tuna Sashimi.  Though I'm sure the fish was fresh, it was too \"chewy\" and unappealing.  I was not impressed.  My husband's meal- also an appetizer- was also too salty and totally uninteresting.  The prices are outlandish given the quality of the food.  I would never go back here!!  Go for the view, not the food!",

It's then a very short 2 min walk up a hill to the restaurant. We had reservations so we were seated immediately! The views were just as amazing in the restaurant. My gf and I wanted to buy a bottle of wine but we weren't  sure what kind we wanted and did not want to waste money on something we did not like considering most of the bottles are some what expensive. So we asked are waiter and he sent his manager right over. the manager was very nice he let us sample 3 different wines before we made up are minds up. We then ordered our food which was excellent!! We were very happy with choosing this restaurant. You won't regret going here if you choose to",

The drinks were so-so.  I tried the two off of the specialty drink menu and one cosmopolitan.  The soup of the day was a fire-roasted tomato with shrimp and crab.  That was excellent, especially if you like spicy food!  I ordered the Mahi Mahi cape cod style, which was cranberries and orange in a very light sauce.  I think it would have been much better if the sauce had more of a thickness so it would stick on the fish.  The fish itself was cooked nicely.  Overall, the view was phenomenal, food was delicious, and drinks were alright.  I would definitely come back for dinner again!",

I thought the elevator up was so very cool mind you I was scared of heights. We arrived mid-afternoon it was a pretty muggy day, the VIEW was still astounding and the interior was fancy looking at first. There were large awkward shaped pillars in the centers on the room holding everything up most likely. They didn't fool anyone by painting them like \"trees\" lol it looked silly and didn't fit well with their up-scale approach. The view is simply breathtaking and I can only imagine what it looked like at night. Its definitely romantic and fancy yet the servers are lacking skill. They aren't keen on refilling water I had to keep stealing my dates lol. They did bring out a glass of champagne because of circumstance I reminded them. They didn't have a good draft selection which baffled me, I would have thought they would have a nice selection of seasonal light beer to pair with their \"fish grotto\" dishes, MILLER LITE it is! Anyways, lets get down to business. We order fried calamari which was frigging awesome if I do remember correctly. I was expecting my thrill to follow suit on through with the dinner, I was thoroughly disappointed however. So both my other half and I order and filet with mash and baby whole potatoes. The meat for lack of better words was a \"chode\" LOL, it was the smallest steak ever, no bigger then a meat ball maybe 2 bites max. The meat size I could have gotten past if it were a delicious savory hunk of tender goodness, BUT Hell no it was like watching DORA the explorer trying to navigate around chunks of fatty tissue and Grissel. I guess this is what i get for ordering a steak at a \"fish grotto.\" Well you ask how are the sides? What goes better with a chode than a piping bag full of garbage pureed mash, eh. They were aiming for new york up-scale and hit mediocre home made at best. There was no flare, no taste nothing but disappointment. I really loved the ambiance of this place the only thing its missing is the food that FITS THE PART. Everything is upscale but my palette was yearning for MORE THAN they could offer us. Don't be fooled that sky-high atmosphere and encapsulating glass 360 view comes with a skyrocketing check. We paid a whooping 170.00-180.00 for the bill our ending balance for my special graduation escapade 600.00 but would have been much less if we ate elsewhere....Thanks for the read try le-mont same price bigger steaks :)",

    "text": "Located in Duquesne Heights, you must visit this restaurant.  If for nothing else, just the night time view of downtown Pittsburgh.  It was wonderful.  There is an upper and a lower level to this restaurant.  The upper-level is fairly pretentious and filled with lots of glitz and suits.  The lower-level is where the bar is located and it contains a small amount of window seating.  Many people go to sit upstairs.  Why?  I don't know.  It is so bright and contrived and you cannot get a very good view.  I prefer the darker lower level where people are more down to earth and real and the fact that you can actually see the city lit up at night. Don't let the coat check fool you.  If you feel uncomfortable, just head to the lower level.  We were greeted by our server and handed the menus.  We were able to look through and asked our server for her suggestions.  We placed our order for the recommended  appetizer that was not on the menu:   Combo Platter: Ichiban (tuna, salmon, and swordfish grilled on a skewer), Crabcake, and Cajun shrimp  I was continually distracted by the view.  You can see the Duquesne Incline, the Southside, Downtown and the Northside and it is amazing how the night coupled with lit buildings can create such a sublime and dramatic image on the horizon -- Beautiful.   I had to focus, though, and was ready for our server when she returned with the appetizer:  French onion soup Butternut squash soup Mahi mahi with garlic- feta mashed potatoes Yellow fin tuna with, garlic-feta mashed potatoes, and tomatoes with balsamic vinaigrette  The tri-partite appetizer combined three of the more popular appetizers on the written menu.  I was quite glad they had this option tonight since I would have been very disappointed to have ordered the Ichiban and the Cajun shrimp as their own dish.  Both were not great and were lacking in flavor.  The fish cubes on the Ichiban skewer were somewhat tough and overcooked with very little flavor.  The shrimp were slightly rubbery and did not taste Cajun.  The price of this appetizer was only $1 more than the crab cake appetizer.  The crab cake was quite good.  It is the best crab cake I have had in the Pittsburgh area.  It was well cooked, moist, tasted of lump crab and had minimal filler.  As we were finishing the appetizer the soups and tomatoes appeared.  My butternut squash soup came in a two-part series to preserve the scant heat in the soup itself and to protect the crab that came at the bottom of my bowl.  The soup was poured over the seeds and crab at the table.  It tasted very good, but unfortunately it cooled rather quickly -- this is on of the issues with Creme Fraiche, you cannot over heat or it will curdle.  I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of the squash in the smooth soup coupled with the fresh crab, pumpkin seed, and creme fraiche.  The French Onion soup had a good flavor. Not over-seasoned, the onions were actually cooked, and a good consomme as its base.    Our dinners arrived and I was surprised by the size.  The portions were quite large for both entrees and one could have easily been split between two people.  A bit apprehensive after the Ichiban, I tried the tuna to find that the flavor was much better for the entree.  The same held True for the mahi-mahi.  The tuna was cooked to a nice medium rare, had good texture and flavor and was not filled with gristle.  The mahi-mahi was tender, moist, and flavorful.  The blackening seasoning had a good flavor and was mildly piquant.    I moved on to the mashed potatoes and my tomatoes.  There was just a hint of the feta and garlic in the potatoes that complimented the potatoes very well.  The tomatoes were good and the vinaigrette was also tasty.  I do wish that they would have used a better oil and vinegar, though.  The oil was a cheaper brand without much flavor and the balsamic was fairly weak, but with good flavor.    Unable to finish our meals, we decided that we wouldn't bother with desserts.  Next time -- and there will be a next time -- the appetizer will be crab cake only and we will be splitting a meal.  With more than enough food for two, this will also cut the bill considerably.  I will continue to sit on the lower level and I hope that I get our server again.",

I was extremely happy that we went to a seafood restaurant instead of the usual steak house.  We had drinks in the lounge first.  AMAZING VIEWS as well.  After a few glasses of wine, we moved to the dining room.  It is very classically vegas meets 50's dinner club.  Over the top yet classy.  We tried the shrimp cocktail (which is served with dry ice smoking underneath) and the tuna tartar.  For dinner we had the crab cake (which was served in a deconstructed manner) and sea bass macadamia.  For sides we tried the creamed spinach, potatoes, and lobster mac and cheese.  The place has a great energy and while large, is not too noisy.  I would recommend this for a business dinner any night of the week.  It is a bit pricey. With drinks the bill was closer too $100 a head.",

It was a beautiful summer evening, so we actually parked at the bottom, rode the cable car up and then walked up the hill to the restaurant.   This place gets a five for the seafood entrees, view (we had a window table), and the service. As far as menu items, everything else gets a two. I don't know what I was thinking ordering a chicken dish at a seafood restaurant but ewww -- it was completely flavorless. However, my date (who grew up on the east coast and has had fabulous seafood offerings his entire life) said his dish here was the best he's ever had. He had a yellow-fin tuna, stuffed with feta. Two years later he still talks about it.",
