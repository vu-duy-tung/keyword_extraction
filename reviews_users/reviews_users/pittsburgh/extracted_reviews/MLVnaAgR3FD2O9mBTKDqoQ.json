The deck was a lot of fun, with flowers in boxes and a striped awning overlooking the street, pretty Meditteranean tiled bistro tables (inside a little more formal, but also very attractive and colorful).   We had Chicken Adana and a grilled shrimp kebab with a delicious salad on the side. Everything was very fresh, and the seasonings were mixing with the grill to make a very tasty dish. We did notice the menu description for Adana and Kofte were the same, and we forgot to ask if it was a typo. A Turkish diner next to us highly recommended the Kunefe for dessert, said they make it themselves, and it was excellent. A baked mild cheese (kadayif, maybe like ricotta?) that absorbs the syrup, topped by a crunch of shredded phyllo and pistachio.",

The front deck has 9 tables and is a very pleasant location, without the traffic noise of Walnut.  The larger tables are inside, but are seamlessly connected to the deck, so all spots are nice.  The food is excellent Mediterranean fare.  We had the large starter, which gave us a taste of everything.  The pita bread was hot and fresh, and a little thicker than wraps, and we had a couple of baskets, for dipping with all the starters.  My sons and I had: Chicken Kabob, Lamb Shish and Falafel/Zucchini.  Everyone loved their food, as good of Mediterranean food as we have  encountered in extensive travels.     Met Muko, who does the cooking, and his family and staff took great care of us.  Turkish Tea hit the spot and the Baklava for dessert was a great wrap-up.    Just opened, but my favorite of the restaurants in the area!",

Everything tasted great and portions were good though I will say for roasted vegetables that accompanied our proteins included grilled jalapeno which lucky for me my husband took a big bite first!

We suspected since it was during the holiday season, they were looking for some more $, and so knowing people would come to restaurants anyway during their time off, it was a good time for them to take advantage of the situation. At that point this place lost its charm for us, and we would not return again.   About the food, the quality is good, but they give you so little for so much. If you want Kabab, they are not the best one in town (go to Turkish Kabab House on Murray+Forbes) and we did not like the kabab. For other vegetarian appetizer/food, they are okay, but again, so little for for so much money. There are other Mediterranean restaurants with all similar food to this place, better quality and lower price, and they don't suddenly remove their lunch special during holidays. Would not return.",

J had authentic Turkish coffee, I had apple tea, and we both ordered the banana crepes. Everything was amazing! J was zooming from the coffee! The apple tea was very tasty, and the crepes were fluffy and flavorful. The ambiance was very nice, bright, and beautifully decorated. We admired the light fixtures, which were from Turkey, and Saleem provided us with the website he orders from, which was very kind.

The menu had lots of Turkish dishes on it. Patio was full but there are 2 garage style roll up doors to the patio that were fully opened. We sat just inside the patio on a beautiful August afternoon.  We shared an appetizer of Babaghanush @ 4.95 :Mixed with eggplant, tahini, mayo, garlic, oil, dill that you eat with a piece of pita.  It's fun to say Babaghanush ! My wife decided on a chicken dish (about $14) and I had Lamb Adana (around $16) -Chopped grilled lamb on skewers flavored with red bell peppers, gently spiced with paprika & garlic. It had a type of cole slaw and a grilled hot pepper and tomato on the side. We both enjoyed it and will return. The only reason I wouldn't rate it 5 stars is because the service was a bit slow since they seemed short staffed with only 1 waitress and the owner pitching in. I would have expected at least 1 other server during the art show since it was busy. But they managed ok I guess. On a side note, we were only given 1 lunch menu and 3 breakfast menus. I'm not sure if they serve breakfast all day, but the breakfast menu looked really good. Not your typical American breakfast by any means. We need to go back to try it!",

Bronzino fish entree was great. Very big fish and juicy. The biggest bronzino I have ever seen. Unfortunately Adana Kebab (ground lamb kebab) was very very bad. It was like rubber. Tasteless and hard to chew. That's why I let the fish eat it lol. The only reason I am giving them 4 star. If the owner is reading this review....lutfen, please do something about it. Adana Kebab is an iconic dish in Turkish cuisine. It must always be good!",

The restaurant is housed in a vintage house with lots of charm, but we opted for outside dining.  We brought our own wine, and for appetizers we shared the falafel, borek, and lentil soup.  All were great, though the lentil soup was more like dal, since it was pureed, but still complex and flavorful.  The shepherd's salad was fresh with just the right amount of herb dressing. Both the chicken and lamb were spicy and juicy, and we all were stuffed by the end of the meal.  Since we had a cake for our celebration, our server had kept it cool in the back and brought it out with the candles lit and song.  The pace of the meal was perfect.  We will be back.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Tuesdays ago with my wife for dinner.  We had seen Pasha and their outdoor patio a couple of times before and had thought about visiting them.  However it was finding them in the Enjoy book that really sealed our visit on this evening.  Whenever we arrived we were asked whether we wanted to sit inside or outside.  Since it was a beautiful day we decided to sit outside and were given a great table with a view of Ivy St.  We were whisked through the inside And so I don't really remember much about it but their outdoor patio is a huge space that fits a number of people comfortably.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to start off by splitting the baba ghanouj.  Then for my entree I ended up going with the chicken kebab while my wife went with the chicken kofte.  Within minutes of ordering our baba ghanouj came out first along with some pita.  It ended up being pretty flavorful and I loved the smokiness that was imparted into the eggplant.  My only complaint about It was that they didn't give us enough pita and so even with generous amounts on each piece of pita we still ended up eating some with or utensils.  After we had finished with that our meals came out with a warning from our server that the peppers were hot.  As someone who generally loves spicy food I decided to try the jalepeno and he really wasn't kidding.  It was super spicy to the point where I even had a tough time eating it but still loved it.  After trying the pepper I decided to try some of the chicken.  It looked charred on the outside and so I was worried about it being overcooked.  However that fear proved to be unfounded as the inside was incredibly juicy and flavorful.  The meal also came with some tomotoes and a side salad. Since I don't eat tomatoes those went to my wife but I really enjoyed the salad.  As weird as this may sound, it was actually seasoned nicely.  Actually everything that we had at Pasha was seasoned nicely which help to make it all taste good.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed all that Pasha had to offer as I thought that the food was great and that their outdoor patio was a great place to eat.",

We both got the Turkish tea and salad. I chose the falafel and zucchini entree and my mom ordered the chicken kabob with rice and veggies. My zucchini was prepared almost like a potato pancake - my mom was crazy about these! Everything was fresh and tasty, and the staff took great care of us. Our favorite part of the meal was the salad, called shepherd salad, which was lots of diced tomatoes and cucumbers - so refreshing!  Oh and this place is BYOB. Nice thought for future visits!",

It's located in a great area, lots of shopping and other cute cafes/restaurants. The food was incredible! So fresh! I ordered a Shepard salad with feta and lamb. The meat was perfectly marinated and cooked. The cheese blew my mind and the veggies were delightful. Don't even get my started on the dressing. So tasty and tangy. I was the recipe! The best Greek salad I've ever had. It felt completely authentic. Props to the chef! And the hostess was adorable. So sweet and helpful. Even gave me some recommendations for other places to check out in the area, knowing I was from out of town. Also ordered a side of pita and a hot Turkish tea. Loved all of it. Highly recommend!",

The chicken was grilled to perfection, without drying out. The staff was extremely friendly. When the owner found out my roommate was fasting for Ramadan, he brought out two dates for her to break her fast with! It was so nice of him. Will definitely go back to try their brunch menu.",

The soundtrack was straight off my iTunes playlist when I brought along my love of Andrea Bocelli, Celine Dion, and musicals to college and learned about a whole bunch of awesome international music. It's a converted home with gorgeous \"bohemian\" (i.e. Turkish because this is actually a Turkish place) lighting, picturesque paintings and colored walls. Eating here is like living in a quirky, \"ethnic\" restaurant from a British RomCom :)  Okay, so now that you want to go there to experience this basic b!tch's college dream life, it's time to talk about the food! I took one bite of the Izgara Kofte and practically did a physical double take. HOW THE HELL WAS THIS SO GOOD??? Seriously, I enacted the wide eyed emoji and looked over to my husband like... you HAVE to try this! He was already basically mirroring me with his Chicken Kofte. The Turkish Tea was such a delightful addition to the meal and the only complaint was from my husband that the baklava was TOO fresh because he likes his when it gets a little more stale/hard. So basically, if you were already going here from my fantabulous intro paragraph, I KNOW you want to go here now :)  I don't like giving out five stars, but heck, I'm not a Michelin critic - I can freaking love a place for is adorableness as WELL as its food :)))",

It had a pleasant looking outside eating area,that is sort of on a deck, I.e, elevated 1/2 a story above the sidewalk.  I did have dinner there and was more than pleased.  The food was fresh and delicious. Everyone was very satisfied. The shepherds salad was simple and beautiful. My dining companions said it was excellent eventhough it was just tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.  I had the lamb/beef Kofte and the lentil soup. Both were great We also shared superb grape leaves and a suave eggplant salad that we all liked better than baba ganoush.  The service was also very attentive. There was plenty of food and they offered to put it in Togo containers.  We did sit on the deck in mid 70 degree weather. It was very pleasant. The inside was super nice too. We did not realize, but it's a BYOB place.  On the way out the owner greeted us warmly.  We left a a happy group of satisfied diners.",

They offered a nice table inside(offers some outdoor seating as well) to escape the heat.  They offer some traditional dishes, expertly and freshly prepared.  I ordered the baba ghanoush, izgara kofte, chicken kofte, and their baklava.  I could taste every ingredient in the balanced baba ghanoush, served with fresh pita, that really satisfied my palate.  The Kofte dishes were also very flavorful and distinct, served with rice, salad, grilled tomato and jalepeno that had some nice heat.  The chocolate baklava reminded me of a perfect blend of tiramisu and a brownie, for its light flaky crunch, coupled with a decadent brownie and light flavors that satisfied so much goodness with every bite.  Pasha Cafe and lounge is worth the visit, not only for the caring and attentive staff, but the great food.  Must go!",

We dined here on a Saturday evening at 6pm when the weather was just beautiful in the upper 70s, and they had their deck open. We called ahead to reserve a table, but there were still tables available at 6pm (in guessing it was too early for the dinner rush).  Our server was genuine and very helpful. He clarified all the questions we had about the money right from the beginning. Their menu isn't crazy extensive, neither is it small, but it has everything that you need! We started with the small mixed cold appetizer platter. We were surprised that we could pick 5 options for the small! We had the hummus, baba ghanoush, grilled mushrooms, eggplant, and white bean salad. They were all so amazing! Quality and taste was exceptional, and the fluffy warm pita was such a treat.   For our mains, we ordered the meat platter and the vegetable platter. Everything was so moist and flavorful, and the falafel and veg patties were extremely tasty!! Both dishes were served with nicely cooked rice and a side salad.  We cannot believe what an amazing experience we had here! We will be back to order the exact same things next time - and hopefully have some room for dessert and Turkish coffee/tea. Please try this place! You will. It be disappointed!",

As fun as walnut street is, I've found good dining to always be a challenge as there are not a ton of options with actually GOOD food. Well this place is it. With an intimate and eastern-chic vibe it's soft lighting and warmth provide the perfect date night venue followed by authentically delicious Turkish food. The service was fast with a great customer service. The prices are fare and reasonable for the portion and quality that you get. We ordered an appetizer and the mix kabob platter for two of us and it was more than enough food! We really enjoyed a relaxed and yummy dinner and will definitely be coming back here for more!",

We have brought a bunch of friends here for their first Turkish cuisine experience. Everyone loves it.  GREAT food and super friendly service. I always get the Adana Kebab. It is expertly prepared. I lived in Adana, Turkey, for 2 years. This dish is spot on. My spouse always gets the chicken kebab. It is always moist and delicious. The accompanying rice and salad are great.  We always start with the Shepard Salad and hummus. Both are perfect. Both are meant to be shared.  The Turkish tea is served in small, bottomless cups. And, the rice pudding is scrumptious. They also have a nice outdoor eating area.  Plus, the location near downtown Shadyside, the best little community in Pittsburgh, makes this an incredible night out. Parking can be tight and may require some patience. Yet it's well worth the effort.  Highly recommend.",

(And NO, I'm not a family member / family friend / paid reviewer, as some others have suggested with these reviews.)  So, this establishment is situated in a Shadyside house, across the street from a bank at the eastern end of Walnut St. It is super comfortable, unless it is a scorching Summer day without a breeze.  They are BYOB, just so you know, but have lots of good non-alcoholic beverages, like their apple tea.  We usually like to order their adana - chicken and lamb are our go-to, but everything we have had is really nice. The cucumber and tomato salad with the lunch special was refreshing and tasty. We also loved their fresh pita and hummus / baba ghanouj as our starter. The baklava is suuuuper sweet, but full of fresh pistachios and is very tasty to split.  The folks who run the place are very friendly, and we felt right at home. We'll definitely be back to keep trying new and different items!",

The boiled egg and feta cheese was served even 10 minutes later! No need to say that the boiled egg was also cold and tasteless when served.  The dish was utterly disappointing and far away from the pictures in the menu. It didn't even include the listed items in the menu! They served us with 2 slices of Swiss cheese instead of Kashkaval and 2 slices of pepper jack instead of blue cheese!!!! The worst part was that the servant was constantly arguing that they are Kashkaval and blue cheese!   All in all, I was expecting way more than this abysmal service. They charged $14 for what I could literally buy from Sam's club for 3-4 bucks.",

As someone else mentioned, I wouldn't be surprised if this place is overrated by friends/family or they paid for ratings.  I ordered pickup from here and the place was empty when there were plenty of people out and about Walnut.  When you think of Mediterranean food you think of bold and flavorful spices. I got the chicken kebab entree which was bland. It came with a small salad with Italian dressing, 3 slices of pita, 5 cubes of chicken, 1/2 a jalapeno, rice, and a 1/5 of a tomato.   Note: the japaleno still had the seeds and pith intact. Half my tomato consisted of the stem core. Really? I expected much better for $18 and the reviews.  Save yourself the money and buy everything at GE for $6 and make it at home. It'll taste better too. Unless your idea of flavor is biting into a grilled jalapeno that isn't even gutted with the seeds and pith intact, I'd stay away.",

First of all we were the the very first customers and it took them 45 minutes to bring us our breakfast (one Mediterranean breakfast + 2 omelettes)!!  The Mediterranean breakfast was supposed to have couple of traditional Turkish cheeses (two types of Kashkaval cheese) + blue cheese and feta cheese. The waiter brought us a cheese platter with swiss + cheddar + pepper jack + gouda cheese!!! One of those platters that you can buy at Sam's Club! I asked the waiter where is the Kashkaval cheese he said oh sorry we don't have it (Ok, if you don't have it tell me while I'm ordering!!). I asked where's my blue cheese he pointed at the pepper jack!!! As if I'm from another planet! He didn't bring us butter and feta cheese until I asked him!  Honestly, I don't wanna go back to Pasha even for dinner now! It takes one bad experience to never go back!!!!",

We ordered grape leaves, hummus, white beans (Piyaz), tabouli, and a yogurt with nuts (Haydari). It was served with fresh tasting, warm pita. The pita was chewy and perfect! It was a wonderful appetizer to get, especially if you have trouble choosing. Everything went very well together. The yogurt with nuts was my favorite!   We wanted to try the Vegetarian dinner that had zucchini and falafel, but they were unfortunately out of falafel! We then got the Shepard salad with chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, parsley, and feta. It was so good! Especially on the pita. Finally, we decided to try the Spinach Borek, which were cigar shaped phyllo pastries stuffed with spinach and onions! Those also went amazingly with the Shepard salad! Everything we ate was so easily paired with everything else, and it made the dinner quite fun. The waitsatff is very pleasant as well, even as we continuously kept asking for the menu and ordering more items. Would definitely come again!",

    "text": "I decided to try this place after shopping on walnut street. It was a cute quaint lookin place From the outside. When we walked in it appeared to be a small family ran business. I felt like I was in someone's home. The menu had a little of everything to try in regards to proteins.  We started off with a fried calamari appetizer. It was okay. I am a calamari lover. Normally it's my go to appetizer when I see it on the menu. This calamari kind of reminded me of what I would have bought in the frozen section of a grocery store and warmed it up in the oven. For my main dish I ordered the salmon. AMAZING!!! I didn't know what to expect because it seemed like the dish was so simple based on the menu. The salmon flavor was perfect. It was perfectly cooked and the taste was tender and flavorful. It also came with a side of rice and a simple salad with a lemon flavored light dressing it was tossed in. I will be adding this place to my restaurant rotation",

    "text": "Best Turkish food ever! My boyfriend and I have eaten here and gotten takeout numerous times, and the quality and portions are always very consistent. The mixed grill entree is probably our favorite. It can sometimes take a while, so be prepared if you're in a rush or have a serious time constraint.  The atmosphere is lovely and quiet, particularly inside, and the patio is an excellent choice during the warmer months. I would recommend sipping on some Turkish tea if you have time to linger after your meal. Everyone who works there is also super friendly and eager to make your experience a pleasant one. Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already!",

We started with the five cold appetizers (grape leaves, baba ghanoush, hummus, another eggplant dish, and spinach as well as the walnut yogurt dish and the cheese pastry. My friend got the grilled vegetable platter with perfectly seasoned mushrooms, tomatoes, onions and peppers and I got the grilled chicken breasts. The only thing I wish it came more with is the rice and/or salad as the portions were slightly small. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Juicy and tender. Unfortunately too full for desert but I can't wait to go back.   Amazing food for a very affordable price.",

I called to place our order and had a few questions regarding the food and it seemed there was a disconnect about the order we had placed. I asked her to read back our order and everything was just as we wanted (nothing was a special request). We ordered the appetizer sampler with cold dips. We were told to pick 5. The sampler was a little on the pricier side but we were looking forward to trying new things. They told us our order would be ready in 15min. We arrived 15 min later and had to wait 15 additional minutes(not the end of the world). We got our order and I was very disappointed. There were only 4 dips in the sampler (we paid for 5) and TWO out of the four they gave us we did not order. Neither of us like mushrooms or grape leaves and that's what they gave us. I also ordered falafel for my meal it was also pricey and a very small portion on a small bed of lettuce with a little hummus for dipping. If we had checked at the restaurant or closer to when we went home we would have told them our order was unsatisfactory. It was too late when we opened our take out at home. We will most likely not be back.",

Going to the place with GPS let me tell you we drove by it two times, because the sign is so small, and plus it is between two buildings, very easy to miss it.   The atmosphere was good I really liked it, but the seats we're very uncomfortable on the balcony . I would say food was not fresh, I don't know if it's because they were not busy at all on a Sunday rush hour.  My husband's lamp kabob was like rubber which he ended up not eating it at all.  I ordered grilled fish which I really liked, but the salad it came with had couple salad leaves that went bad, onions were saggy. We both had rice as a side, and we both did not like it, because it had some type of smell, and quality was not pleasing, basically because it was not fresh, It seemed like they have made it a week ago.  Overall we both were not pleased, I wish they had good quality fresh food, because we both like Greek food and I really liked the atmosphere. Customer service was good.",
