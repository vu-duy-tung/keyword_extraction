    "text": "I'm not one for fancy pizza- I come from the land of five dollar pies (now six dollars) in Oakland. My pizza standards are pretty low, and paying $14 for pizza is not on my to do list.   Nonetheless, we tried this place since it's new. We got the pizza with the egg on it (forget what it's called) and waited probably 20 minutes for it to come out. I know, I know, it's pizza baked in an oven. The pizza was tasty and the dough was good.  Three negatives:   One, they aren't open on Sundays. What the what. We were so disappointed. Yes, we know, you like to have a day off, you have lives. Fine. But being closed for 1/2 of the weekend seems cray.  Two, they don't have a website. When we were trying to order on a Sunday we wanted to see a menu but couldn't because well, there's no website. It costs minimal money to host a website. They do have Twitter and Facebook, but the link to their menu on their FB page is broken. This is nit picky, I know, but I do social meedz on the side, so my standards are high!  Three, it took foooooreveerrrr to get our check. Our waitress disappeared and we were ready to g-o.",

We had the margarita which was delicious. I also like the Greenpointer. I went easy with the hot honey. Although it is delicious, I do not like too much sweet on my pizza.   The only thing is they don't have much else on the menu except in arugula salad for appetizer and ice cream for dessert. Still worth it. Would go again!",

Also, get the fresh mozzarella if you're there on a weekend evening.   Thanks to Tony for the great experience.",

We also had the Greenpointer, with spicy soppresata and honey, which was a perfect combination of sweetness and heat.    A lot of other reviews mention Dinette which is close by.  Having been to both, my advice is to bypass Dinette and go straight to Pizza Taglio.   Make sure to remember your wine - it's BYOB.",

The soppressata was delicious and the spicy honey added a nice kick. I would suggest making the pizzas larger since the crust is so thin, the middle of the pizza was barely cooked and fell apart as soon as we picked it up. This is the closest to authentic Italian pizza that I've found yet in Pittsburgh.",

The Margherita pizza has an unbelievable sauce, and the Reds with meat are delicious. We also tried a white pizza with arugula and ricotta. Dessert included ricotta with honey and vanilla ice cream with marinated cherries. Felt just like Roma!!!! We will be back again and again.

    "text": "There's a spot within the block around my building that I enjoy! It's a pizza miracle.  +1 and I ran over here on a rainy weekday as we've been meaning to come over since they opened. I'm typically a little sketchy about places that I'm unsure of how they operate. Is it table service? Yes. Can you come in and get a whole pie to go? Yes .. Well, maybe--I tried to do this Saturday night and was turned away (in the nicest, \"I can ask Tony!\" kind of way) because of a short supply of dough--call ahead.  At least this past week, immediately, we were greeted and told to sit wherever. This super friendly staff member let us know it is BYOB so you are damn right I ran back across the street in the rain to grab a bottle. She also explained the menu of few white pizza, a few reds, and how most people eat at least half a pie. I already knew I was getting my own. Amateurs.  I naturally had the ricotta pie. White sauce on some serious dough, crushed cherry tomatoes, piles of ricotta, and topped with black pepper and arugla. Woof. Right? I'm gonna go broke with this being across the street and thirteen a pie. +1 had the ever popular Greenpointe which included some huge slices of spicy sopressa (or maybe soppressata?) and that hot honey over red and mozzarella.  I, eating around the sausage, even liked it. They were perfect, if a bit underdone in the middle for a few (but seriously, just the way I would want them). The service stayed great, although a tiny bit hovering.  At least three staff members and Mr. Giamarita came by to make sure everything was done well.  We genuinely had a great time (with our entire bottle of wine gone).  Please make note this is \"Roman\" style pizza.  They're cooked longer, giving that crispy outside with everything melted and ready to go in the middle. This means you won't get the flat grease by the slice you're used to and it's going to take a bit more time.  Patience (and pizza!) is virtue.",

    "text": "Pittsburgh is growing fast. Just three years ago, there were barely any places to buy fancy pizza. Also, you would drop about $15 to get dough... and maybe an afterthought of cheese (albeit, delicious, delicious cheese) and half a sneeze worth of toppings. While those restaurants were able to keep my belly happy, a recent outburst of similarly priced or cheaper restaurants with the same quality ingredients (and more of it) has popped up around the city, giving those old ones some competition.  Pizza Taglio provides unique, creative topping combinations on top of fresh dough. The crust was absolutely perfect: crunchy on the outside with a little bit of chewiness in the inside. The mozzarella was fresh and did that awesome gooey stretching that you would delete your internet history for if you watched it for too long. I was boring and got the speck, arugula, mozzarella pizza with blistered tomatoes and balsamic glaze. Simple concept, but not always easy to execute perfectly. I was happily pleased with the ratio of the toppings, the arugula was fresh and spicy, and the speck was fatty and crispy.  In addition, they have really sweet service. Everyone was smiling and we had some great conversations with the people working there. I had a pleasant afternoon.  Overall, I see myself coming back here often on rainy days or simple date nights.",

His passion and love for his craft are infectious, and it's always a pleasure to have a chat with him when he swings by your table.

The zucchini pizza (Adios Anoia), on the other hand...sometimes we get two just to eat one for dinner, and eat one for breakfast with a few eggs baked on top. We're a fan of several of the red pizzas as well, but somehow, this vegetarian pizza is what truly makes our (carnivore) hearts sing! If you get a pizza with the hot honey, and you're getting it to go, ask them to leave it uncut--the honey tends to run out onto the cardboard, and then you're missing out on half of the deliciousness.  The downsides--it's not cheap, but it's \"gourmet\" pizza so you probably weren't expecting $5 pies. Also, they've been charring their pizzas a bit more lately, to the point of some unpleasant bitterness on the edge of the crust. If you are getting pickup, I recommend calling substantially (like an hour) ahead of time--they get surprisingly backed up, even on weeknights. I guess the word is out!",

    "text": "I stopped by on Thurs. evening around 7:30 with a friend for dinner.  I'd been wanting to try Pizza Taglio for awhile.  Given that my friend lives and works nearby, it seemed like a natural choice for a casual-yet-nice dinner to thank her for taking care of my cat over the holidays.  We started off with the arugula salad ($12), which consists of the titular vegetable plus grape tomatoes and fresh mozzarella balls drizzled with balsamic vinegar.  All of the ingredients were fresh and tasted good.  As would be expected given the ingredients, it was reminiscent of caprese salad, but was more similar in composition to a regular salad.  The size was large enough to share, as indicated on the menu.  For our main course, we decided to go with the Jackie pizza ($14).  This is a white pizza with a cheese base (forget which cheese--apologies), cremini mushrooms, and prosciutto.  We opted to get it with the optional duck egg on top (+$1), which was a great choice.  Although the pizza is flavorful enough to stand on its own, the broken egg yolk adds an extra dimension of creaminess and richness that complements the other ingredients nicely.  Overall, we were pleased with our meal at Pizza Taglio.  We didn't bring booze (my friend was driving), but the people at most of the other tables did, given that it's BYOB.  Service wasn't the most attentive, but was fine when we needed it, and our waitress was able to describe items and offer recommendations.  One thing to be aware of is that the pizza isn't super huge (about 14\" or so in diameter), and only contains 6 slices, so I recommend getting an appetizer/salad or a second pie if you're hungry.",

I guess I didn't realize how incredibly expensive this place is when I came before, since I split the bill with two other girls. The pizzas were good, as they were last time, however- they didn't cut the slices for me. Meaning, that when I brought these back home to the South side of Pittsburgh, they had cooled and were difficult to slice. Luckily I own a pizza cutter and was able to cut it, but it took a while. The pizzas also looked ridiculous in the normal size pizza boxes- they looked so tiny. The flavors of these pies are still really good, but I caution you that they are overpriced and may not slice the pies for you if you get them to go.",

    "text": "In a nutshell: new, hip wood-fired pizza joint in Pittsburgh. Decent menu, a little pricey. Pizzas were ok, but disappointing for the high price tag.   After visiting Paulie Gee's in NY a few years ago, I fell in love with Mike's Hot Honey, which is a chili infused honey. It is to die for on pizza. So when I saw that Pizza Taglio offered a pie (the Greenpointer) similar to Paulie Gee's Honey Hellboy, I was dying to see if Pittsburgh would have its own version of my all-time favorite pie. Not quite. Maybe there's something about the preparation, but the middle of my pizza was very soggy. I'm ok with a droopy pizza slice, but this was very hard to pick up. Parts that weren't soggy  tasted ok but there wasn't very much sopressata. You basically only got one, maybe two bites of sopressata in each slice. My husband got the margherita, which he thinks is a True test of the quality of pie because there's no hiding behind fancy ingredients. Sadly to say, the margherita was not impressive and was pretty bland, overpowered by the flavor of cheese rather than the fresh flavors of a True margherita: the tomatoes and basil.  I have a feeling Pizza Taglio was trying to channel Paulie Gee's with its use and sale of Mike's Hot Honey, along with naming the Mikes Hot Honey pie the \"Greenpointer,\" considering that's where the NY Paulie Gee's is: Greenpoint. Unfortunately, I will have to go back to Paulie Gee's for my hot honey & sopressata pizza fix.",

I came in one night to order a carry-out pie. It wasn't busy at all and they got started on my pizza as soon as I ordered. I forgot the name of it, but it was the one with an egg on it and I added sausage. My only two criticisms are the price relative to the size of the pizza, and the fact that it got cold really quickly. I'm certainly not an authentic Italian pizza connoisseur, but it was great! The most memorable part was that the crust was baked to a perfect crunchiness. The cheese was perfectly melted; it was a simple and very satisfying meal.   I really like that you can see the kitchen area where they bake the pizzas. Everyone who worked there seemed to be enjoying themselves, which I think created a friendly atmosphere. I'd definitely try it again.",

I had heard good things about Pizza Taglio for awhile and kept walking past it on my way to other great eats on this street, but my cravings for all different types of food usually trumps my cravings for pizza, so it took me more time than it should've to make it here.  Finally suggested it to a couple of friends, and so glad I did! The Wednesday evening we went, the place felt a little empty, a little too quiet, but I've walked past before on weekend nights and it looks cozy and bustling from the outside.  We started with an arugula salad -- not much to say about it, exactly what you would expect from the ingredients, nothing out of the ordinary but it's a solid salad.  The pizza, on the other hand, was amazing! We ordered the Greenpointer based on Yelp reviews. It was absolutely scrumptious and addictive. The crust is great, the red sauce is great, the soppressata is savory and crispy, but what gives the dish its uniquely addictive flavor is that Hot honey people keep talking about. It kicks up the spice just a little and mellows it out with its sweetness.  That's one memorable pizza. I will be back!",

But based off my first experience @ Pizza Taglio I would say they are much better. Their menu is pretty simple, no appetizers or salads, just pizza. The selection is broken up into white and red pizzas, and you have about six different pizza choices for each. There's only a couple vegetarian pizza choices, but really any pizza can be made vegetarian if you eliminate the meat. My husband and I split 2 pizzas, the cauliflower & speck mato without the speck (so it was vegetarian). Both pizzas were amazing! So much flavor! I liked the cauliflower just slightly more. The Mikes Hot Honey was a nice touch.  Their prices are really good for the size of pizza you get. The pizzas are pretty decent size for one person, chances are you'll be able to bring some home. Service was great, everybody very friendly.  Can't wait to go back and try some more pizzas. Pizza Taglio is a must try ASAP!",

Keep in mind that this is a little upscale, $12-16 for a 15-inch, generally light pizza. BYOB, so bring a nice wine to pair with it.    Pros: nice, open atmosphere. Good service, Giuseppe was very friendly. I got a Carbonara pizza, which I can't recall exactly the kind of meat which was on it, but had no tomato sauce, an egg yolk, some really good cheese and some Italian meat similar to bacon. The chef offered to add more yolks if I desired, which I later asked for. So, authentic, unique Italian food, to say the least.  Cons: They only serve pizza, which makes sense. But nothing else. I heard that they possibly serve cannolis other days. Hipster atmosphere. Expensive price for a pizza. If you observe kosher or halal rules, I'd be wary of this place...halal especially, the only meats they serve are pig ones, it seems. So expect to be surprised, don't look for something like your average Papa John's or Dominoes.",

    "text": "One of the hip new places in Pittsburgh attracts another winner.  Pizza Taglio takes on a bloated market in the city, but hones in on something we lack.  Simple, well executed, wood-fired pizzas.  More on the pizza in a moment. The wife, daughter, and myself circled the East Liberty area scouring for a parking spot.  After 5-10 minutes I surrendered and dropped them out front and \"illegally\" parked in the Whole Foods, Petco, CVS lot across the street.  With so many places to eat at parking will be problematic for Pizza Taglio and it's neighboring restaurants. I entered the small 20ish seater eatery and could instantly smell burning wood, fresh dough, and a faint linger of smoke.  Friendly greetings soon followed as I walked towards my girls.  They were already sipping drinks and reading the menu.  We were instructed that two pizzas should feed the the 2 1/2 of us so we ordered the New Ricotta Pie and the Greenpointer (thanks Yelpers!).   My daughter was interested in watching them make and bake the pizzas and because of where we were sitting she stood on my lap and watched intently.  The workers behind the counter talked to her and encouraged the curiosity.   Our pizzas arrived in about 10 minutes and we were welcomed with two beautiful pies.  My daughter loved the ricotta pie, despite being a somewhat picky eater.  My wife was craving \"thin crust, wood fired pizza\" and she was pleased.  I devoured a slice of the ricotta first knowing that my girls would gravitate towards it so I'd better get gnashing.  The ricotta was silky and rich, the blistered tomatoes were fresh and popped with additional flavor.  The crust....yes exactly what I had hoped for -- Crisp edges, not too thin, yet not a pillow with plenty of air pockets and chew.  The Greenpointer was the star for me however.  The red sauce was not over done and not sweet, the sweetness was obtained with the hot honey.  Then the spicy Sopresseta....yep, that set it off.   I give this 4 stars because we ate 2 pizzas and a dessert and paid a little of $40 bucks.  I get that its going to be more expensive, but that's pushing my boundaries to visit often.  The parking was annoying and if I could I'd give them 4.5 stars.",

My husband and I split the arugula salad and the Green Point pizza. Both were delicious, but shortly after a second pizza appeared at our table! Apparently they had just gotten a new oven and our first pizza was deemed \"misshapen\" and we were comped a second pizza! We totally intended to take the second one home, but um, just ended up eating the whole thing. I'm definitely looking forward to making my way through their menu- probably with the optional Mikes Hot Honey on all of them, so good!  We had a great time here.

You have to try the espresso, which is a special blend Tony gets from Zeke's. It may be the best espresso in town. It's definitely the best pizza in town.",

There was no menu \"they're not printed yet\". I thought they only had pizza since that was all that was listed on the blackboard -6 varieties, but it appeared they had other choices. The rest room (unlabeled) is down the hall but if you go there u get locked out. I had the asparagus pizza which was delicious. The staff seems to be trying really hard so maybe with time things will run smoother. I was entertained throughout my meal by the black spider crawling up and down the counter & on the coffee grinder.  This was the reason I passed on the delicious looking chocolate cake, sliced but uncovered on a plate next to the coffee grinder.",

Inside, the cook (pizza God) looked over and gave me a smile. I had a good feeling about this place. i stopped what I was doing and went with my intuition. I was greeted by a very calm, informative waitress. I ordered a latte, and a single pizza for myself. The latte came out in great timing, not too quickly which told me they took great care in preparing it. It was perfect. Upon finishing my caffeinated beverage, the holy grail, my pizza, arrived. I have never had something so delectable in my face. I ate the WHOLE pie in one sitting, and didn't feel one bit of remorse. The ingredients were fresh, I even added a few new tastes to my palate that day. Overall, service was great. Location, fabulous. Food so undeniably good that when you leave you get kind of sad knowing that you've just reached the peak of your day. Taglio is my religion.",

    "text": "I will couch everything here with the caveat that this place just opened and may still be figuring things out. First- the pros: the pizza is inventive and delicious! Definitely try the Greenpointer, the added honey is unexpected and fantastic! It was even good the next day reheated for lunch. The front opens to the street, which is always welcome on warm evenings. The cons: the menu is basically just pizza. No salads, etc. The wait staff were actually too attentive, believe it or not. The place was only about 1/3 full the evening we were there. Every 5 min one of 2 waiters would come by to ask how we were doing, did we need something, are we ready to order, it was annoying! Also what's with waiters asking if you want your water refilled? Please don't interrupt our dinner conversation to ask about tap water- just refill it! But this issue may just be a pet peeve of mine. Because of this over attentiveness we were rushed through our meal too quickly to enjoy. We paused from eating briefly to talk and BAM! Waiter at the table to ask if we wanted to box up the rest. No thanks, we JUST got the food. The place also needs a sound system so they aren't blasting music from a jambox on the pizza counter so anyone seated nearby is deafened. All of this is to say that I still give it 4 stars because the food tasted great and I was excited to eat my leftovers the next day. How it holds up against Dinette which has a similar menu and is just around the corner (with better waitstaff) is yet to be seen.",

Their salad is just as phenomenal as the pizza and the cheese is so incredibly fresh! The service is pretty good, and friendly as well. The price tag approx $ 12-$16 a pizza is pretty intimidating but I've comfortably shared a pizza with another person both times (I did regret it though, based on taste, I did want my own). Parking is as convenient as you could hope for the area, there is a decent amount of seating and I've never encountered a wait even at prime dinner times. Certainly a place that your taste buds will thank you for investing in.",

There was a wait (it was about 7:00pm on a Saturday, so that was to be expected. My boyfriend and I put our names in and then we went next door to have a drink at The Livermore while we waited. The wait was only half the time we were quoted. Woo hoo!  To start, the ambiance is, well, lacking. I feel like it's a bit drab inside. It gives me the impression they took the style of pizza by the slice kind of place and turned the lights down to make it \"hip\". I think with a few minor stylistic changes, this place could go to the next level, while still keeping with the casual, low-key vibe. I was also a bit disappointed that they have a deli counter set up in the middle of the restaurant and it is pretty messy and fully on display to the restaurant. I think this could have been a really cool way of giving the diners a hit of what goes into making some of the dishes (like having an open kitchen would), but instead I just wanted to keep from looking at it because it was distracting (and not so good way).  DRINKS This place is BYOB. I believe it was $5/person.  FOOD To eat we had the following:  - Antipasto Plate - Greenpointer pizza - Bob Malnati pizza  The antipasto plate was good and I may order it again if I'm in the mood for some sliced meats. The chunks of pecorino were pretty small, but for two people it was satisfying. The pizzas were both very good! I kept trying to figure out which I liked better, and honestly it might have been the Bob Malnati. I lived in Greenpoint for a bit, so perhaps I'm partial to Paulie Gee's version of Taglio's Greenpointer, the Hellboy.  OVERALL I will absolutely come back and often. Long wait? Who cares when there is a lovely little bar next door. Good pizza, BYOB, and good value. Go! You won't be disappointed, at least not if you sit away from the deli counter ;)",

It's not pretentious and you can really taste all the elements of it. Theirs was fantastic! It was thin but wasn't so thin that it couldn't hold any toppings. Also, I could tell that they didn't use just white flour. It had a nice nuttiness to it. I asked and they said they now use about 25% whole wheat. They also cold ferment their dough two days. That's what helps with the complex flavors. The next most important thing to me is the sauce. I loved their unadulterated tomato sauce. They use real DOP San Marzano tomatoes and you can tell! It's bright and lovely. I pretty much fell in love with it!   I was greeted when I walked in and told them a friend would join me. I waited at the table and no waiter showed up. I had to go ask the girl if I could put an order in. To make a long story short it got busy and I didn't really see her again. Finally got her to take my card and then waited for another 10 minutes and another girl brought it back.   Overall the pizza really stands alone. I can get over bad service as long as I have good pizza. I will definitely be back again. If you're in the area give them a chance. You never know, you could just fall in love!",

It was a little soggy crust wise but I did enjoy the flavors.   We wanted to try the hot honey because we weren't getting any pizza with it on, so we ordered a side of it and definitely enjoyed dipping some of our pizza in it. IT IS SPICY THOUGH!   They are a bit pricey for some za, I think each one cost us $15. Not horrible by any means especially for the ingredients, just wish they were a bit larger for the money. Other than that I'll definitely be back to try one with the hot honey!",

I do think that the menu is fairly limited. We are mostly vegetarian and were able to alter some of the pizzas. But, going there and spending $16 for a medium size fired pizza, I would like to see specials or a little more variety in the options. As much as we like it-and it is definitely great; without a lot of options, we won't be there very often. Definitely worth the try-let me know what you think!",

It brought the pizza to an entirely different level! Absolutely delicious. We also had the Bob Manleti pizza. It was absolutely delightful, the perfect balance of spicy, smoky, and sweet. At this point we were full and we asked for the sfogliatelle to go. It was absolutely scrumptious as well.  The service was great, atmosphere was relaxed but nice. We loved this place so much that we are going back to dinner tonight. We are visiting from out of town and know that the only way to get pizza like this is in Italy, so we decided to take advantage. I highly recommend this place!  ***Five stars plus***",

The Greenpointer features a dynamic combination of Mike's Hot Honey, along with spicy soppressata and homemade mozzarella. If you prefer a white pizza, the New Ricotta Pie is a great choice, with savory ricotta and fresh Roma tomatoes (there is a ricotta appetizer as well!) The fresh house salad is an excellent starter and is accompanied by the homemade mozzarella.  The trendy, casual atmosphere works well for either a quick bite or date night, and also offers takeout. The service is top-notch, with friendly, prompt attention and information about the menu.  Definitely worth a stop (or more!)",

It is a smaller restaurant, with intimate seating and really interesting decor. In the back corner there is an enormous oven. The menu is short and sweet, and changes pretty frequently. One thing I must point out is the fresh ingredients used. Good quality, homemade everything, and not at all greasy. It is as close to real Italian pizza as you can get.   I recently ordered a margarita pizza and a white ricotta pizza. It is a thin crust, with a harder, large end crust piece. It maintains it's chewiness throughout. The cheese is not overbearing and a good ratio with the sauce.   Now I must say it: the best thing to put on your pizza is the hot honey. Sweet with a little kick, it is absolutely incredible and really brings out the best in the pizza. I look forward to it every time I visit and it goes well with every pizza I have put it on thus far.",

Ordinarily I feel like $14 is a little much for pizza, but 2/$20 was just about right to get me to give it a chance. Also, it'  The wait was 45 minutes for a table for 4, but I suppose that's to be expected during restaurant week. We waited at the Livermore, which was considerably less crowded.  The wait staff was friendly and really helpful to me in navigating the menu to find vegetarian options. There are several, and they can do almost all the other pizzas without meat, if you're into that. I ordered the cauliflower pizza because it was intriguing and seasonal.  It was SO GOOD. I loved it! The white base has just the right amount of roasted garlic, and the cauliflower is cooked perfectly (I was worried it might come out undercooked). The crust is perfectly chewy - I'm a big fan. The pizza did take about 25 minutes to come out, which I think is typical for a place like this. Taken together with the long wait for a table, we were pretty much starving when our food finally came.  Would I return? Yes, if I'm craving high-end pizza and don't mind the potential wait.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Thursday evening with my wife and another couple for dinner.  We arrived to Pizza Taglio at just after 7 PM to find the place completely packed except for an empty 6 top.  The hostess told us that it would be a few minutes to wait and so we did.  It ended up being around 10 minutes due to other tables sitting around and talking, not that it was a big deal.  The inside of Pizza Taglio consists of mostly dining tables and then an open area where they prepare the food, including a large brick oven.  They are also a BYOB place (2.50/person) which means that I went scrambling off to the local liquor store for some wine for our table.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split a salad and a pizza and so went with the arugula salad and the pig face pizza.  The menu describes the arugula salad as cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, Sicilian EVOO and a balsamic drizzle while the pig face pizza was described as guanciale, red onions, chile flakes and pecorino.  Our salad came out first and I thought it was rather good.  As you would expect from an arugula salad, the greens had a nice peppery bite to them and I really enjoyed the fresh mozzarella.  I also enjoyed the balsamic drizzle but wished there had been more of it as they were rather stingy and so my wife and I had a lot of salad without it.  After we had finished with that our pizza came out.  Honestly, my first thought was where is all the cheese?  Thankfully that didn't matter as the pizza was perfect and delicious exactly the way it was.  The sauce was really good and flavorful and even had a nice little backend heat to it.  Meanwhile the onions gave it some flavor and aromatics while the guanciale was delicious and added a nice bit of salt.  It's crust was also quite good as it was crispy on the outside and had a nice bite to it.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Yes it's a little pricy at around $15 for a 6 cut pizza but the flavors of those pizzas make it worth a trip.",

When we were finally seated an hour later we realized the restaurant was BYOB. We quickly placed our orders and all four of us ran four different directions-me to grab wine from my apartment which was around the corner and my friends to the wine and spirits store across the street. I'm incredibly grateful for the waitstaff for not judging us! Our food was served to us upon our arrival pipping hot. The pizzas are unique and flavorful.

The atmosphere is intimate and relaxed, though it was loud enough that we sometimes found it hard to hear each other.   Now the food. The crust is phenomenal, some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh! The toppings, however, leave a lot to be desired. People seem very enthusiastic about the Greenpointer - it turned out to be pretty greasy without a lot of flavor. Maybe a pepperoni-style for those who don't like pepperoni taste? The Bob Malnati was tasty and had good flavor! Though, it was similarly soggy. The crust is thin, without a lot of cheese or toppings, and so the pizza isn't that filling - we could have each easily eaten a full pizza, in addition to our beers (we're both athletes and have healthy appetites).

Lately it has become our \"go-to\" spot for larger groups or out-of-town guests. Menu is as simple, authentic, and delicious as it comes: antipasto or arugula salad as a starter, red or white pizzas for main, cannolis and espresso for dessert. Their red sauce ...I don't know what it is, but the flavor, the subtle sweetness, the fresh herbs, it truly is so delectable. Always get the marinara sans cheese and typically add the Calabrian chilies (first place I've ever laid eyes on these babies...they are so flavorful and pack a serious punch). Each pie is a generous six slices. The right move is always to order a variety and share as a table. They do not take reservations and at times I've attempted to call to give them a friendly heads up, yet no one typically answers. They are adjoined with Lorelei so best bet is to put your name on the wait list and hit one of the many bars and restaurants in the vicinity until your table is ready. Prices are so so reasonable, and the waitresses and waiters are super friendly. Can't say enough great things!",

I had the Ricotta Pie and ate all of it except the last slice (which heated up great the next day).  My boyfriend had the May the Swartz Be With You and gobbled it up.

Pizza Taglio is one of our favorite joints in the city, and seeing how the pizza is made from start to finish was truly an incredible experience! We especially loved learning how the homemade mozzarella is made, and tasting the finished product. The pizza is delicious-they use a blend of flours in their dough which takes a couple days to make. Sauce is light, bright, and perfect. HIGHLY recommend the Greenpointer, in fact, just go ahead and ask for a hot honey drizzle on anything you order because it puts it over the top! Tony is incredibly passionate and knowledgeable  about pizza-making. We had an amazing time!   Remember to bring a bottle of wine, it's BYOB. For two people, would recommend starting with the arugula salad (fresh mozzarella with a balsamic drizzle is the star here) and at least 2 pizza's. Or 3.

I got the Bob, which was spicy with a nice kick but not overwhelmingly so. It was tasty.

    "text": "Go here!   I have walked past this place a bunch of times thinking it was \"yet another fancy pizza joint\".  Boy, was I wrong.  The place has a great feel to it, with a friendly and knowledgeable staff and a welcoming attitude.  We brought several bottles of wine and settled in to try some stuff out.  The owner, Tony, clearly loves what he is doing and it shows in the food and the atmosphere.    We started with the cheese and meat plate and the house-made ricotta.  The ricotta was the star of the evening...soft and luscious with just the right amount of bread that was charred in the huge wood fired oven.   Highly recommend.     We also sampled the Greenpointer (made with sweet sopressata instead of spicy for the spice wimp in our group), the Waypointer, and the Ricotta pizzas.   I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite, as all of them were really good in their own ways.  I'll be back to try the Greenpointer as it is intended, since I think the hot honey, spicy sopressata combo is going to be a big winner.   The Waypointer had a great mix of flavors with the caramelized onions and a spicy sausage.  The Ricotta featured two kinds of cheese and some fresh local cherry tomatoes.  It was dressed with basil and was very fresh tasting.      Overall, a great evening and I'd absolutely go back.",

I went on a Monday evening and it was not busy at all so no problem getting a seat.  The waitress was very nice and informative with my questions.  I decided to try the Greenpointer pizza because I was so curious how honey would taste on it.  The pizza was big, I could easily have shared. And came out nice and hot.  The pizza was delicious, and the honey gave it a perfect sweet kick to the spice of the sopressata.  The pizza was crisp, but the crust at the top was soft, just the way I like it.  I took my leftovers home and happily ate them and unhappily shared a slice with my hubby (I wanted it all myself).",

    "text": "I'm pretty conflicted about this place. The crust is amazing. By far by MILES the best crust I've ever had in Pittsburgh and prob the best crust of my entire life. And I've tried a lot of different pizza places. But we had some issues with my pizza.  When we called to order they were out of speck, so we got guanciale instead. We went by the menu on their website. Ordered the ricotta pie which is supposed to have ricotta, mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, and arugula. I asked for no tomatoes and added guanciale, they were fine with substitutions which we were happy about. The pizza I received had ricotta, mozz, GARLIC, basil.... and no arugula. When we called back about this (if you're spending $35 or 40 on two small pizzas I would really expect them to be perfect.. not a lot to ask at these prices) they said they're actually out of arugula.  I wish they had told us this when we had originally placed the order. Or at least called back to let us know. I'm pregnant and like the only reason I got that particular pizza was BECAUSE of the arugula. Also during the call back we are told that the menu on their own website is apparently not updated. Uhh. So like they just add 5 pieces of basil on a pizza that's supposed to have arugula. And garlic is listed on two of the OTHER pizzas, but the pizza I ordered definitely was not supposed to have garlic. If only I had known that it was my job to make extra sure that they wouldn't put on an ingredient (two, really) that I hadn't been expecting in the first place.  So all in all, a place that charges $15 plus tax for each pizza honestly NEEDS to be detail-oriented and be on top of their shit! Their website should be updated and accurate! They should have all their ingredients in stock on a Saturday evening! They should PAY ATTENTION to each individual order.. read the tickets.. read them two or three times if that's what you need to do.. this was just really disappointing from a place that I wanted to make our new regular pizza place. One other negative is the menu literally consists of certain topping combos, 4 red pizzas and 4 white ones so slim pickins, especially when they don't even have the ingredients for all of them! The crust is really, really, really good though. And they did offer to make a new pizza but still without arugula. :(",

We got there around 6pm on a Friday and were seated right away which was awesome (not so awesome - parking situation, but hey it is East Liberty).

It's BYOB and I asked hubs if he was bringing anything. Nope, so when he arrives I ask him to do the ordering as I make a dash across Centre Ave to grab a bottle of vino.  I come back and a burrata salad has arrived to start. Perfect timing. The salad is fairly solid, a bit more cheese than anticipated. The balsamic is lightly drizzled across the salad.  The capriciosa pizza arrives. It looks amazing. The pizza arrives on a standard dish plate so the middle of the pizza was soggy from the moisture. We also weren't given clean plates after the salad, so that adds to the sogginess as well. The artichokes and olives add good flavor. I hardly had any ham, hence how it was listed last in the description. I thought some pepper could add value. Overall, it reminded me of the pizza in Italy for sure!",

While the pizzas are meant to be Roman style, they more resembled my local delivery place. My local delivery place is awesome...so it tasted really good...but it wasn't the True Roman Style that I anticipated.   It's BYOB which is good and it's a reasonable fee.

I just wish there was more of it. I could eat fresh basil by the handful, and there was only like 4 pieces on our whole pizza. I really liked the pizza. However, it was a tad soggy on the bottom. I love a good crispy crust. Still great though.  The best part of Pizza Taglio is the fact that it is BYOB! They only charge $2.50 a person for the glass, which is so much more reasonable then other places corkage fee.  If you love fresh, homemade, wood fired pizza, then give Pizza Taglio a try!",

The flavors and textures were phenomenal. They reminded me a bit of Proper Brick Oven Pizzas (in the style but different flavors) which I also love.

We had the Antipasto plate as an appetizer and then we ordered two separate pizzas I had the Adios Anoia and my hubby had the Bob Malnati.  My pizza was excellent!  The crust is phenomenal!  I tried a bite of my hubby's pizza, but it was a bit spicy for my tastes.    My only (slight) complaint is that there was a 6 top table open when we arrived and we were told that there was a 20-30 minute wait.  Ok, no problem.  But then after waiting 30 minutes we ended up being seated at the 6 top that was empty since we walked in the door.  I understand that you want to use tables wisely, but on the flip side, we could have been in an out much quicker if we would have been given the table in the first place!

The service was not very attentive and was really slow; even for us to get a table. There were open tables, no one was just coming around to clean them.   I'm not a pizza connoisseur by any means, but I just wasn't impressed by their pizzas, especially for the hefty price of ~$16 per personal sized pizza. I could understand if they were special pizzas, but all of the pizzas are pretty simple and plain... I got the ricotta pizza and it was good but again, there was nothing special to it.   The menu is pretty small and the options are limited. All in all, I would probably recommend a different pizza shop at this price point.",

One downfall was finding a parking space - so we had to walk a bit to the restaurant!   However, I was presently surprised that it wasn't busy once we got to the restaurant. We got seated right away. Pro Tip: it's BYOB! We had researched it before hand, so brought a bottle of wine. If you don't have wine - there's a wine & spirit around the corner.   For an appetizer- we started with the Mixed Greens & Mozzarella salad - it was very good! I would definitely order it again!   We ordered two pizzas and split them! The best of both worlds. We ordered the Ricotta Pizza and the Margherita Pizza. To be honest - the Ricotta pizza was amazinggg and the margherita pizza was very plain! I wouldn't get it again.   I'll definitely visit Pizza Taglio again soon!",

The waiters are nice and giuseppe speaks italian too. I recommend the Norma, the pigface (for some guanciale), and the carbonara. Their tiramisu is pretty good as well, similar to enrico biscotti's one in the strip.  Drawback: they don't take reservations, so you might have to wait a bit during the weekend (even 1-1.5 hours), but lorelei, the bar next door, will make your wait more pleasant with another good selection of beers and drinks.",

Their menu is pretty small but consists of some apps, white, and red pizzas. I ended up going with the ricotta white pizza, and my friends had the Norwegian and Norma. The pizzas were delicious! My ricotta pizza was nice and cheesy and the fresh fried garlic on top really made the pizza. My friend loved the fried eggplant on her red pizza. The Norma was also yummy. It seems like any of their pizzas would be an excellent choice. They are also a nice size and the crust is perfect. I will definitely be back!",

It's not a replica of what we think is actual pizza, it's just perfect. It's the produce, the cheese, the crust, the style of cooking and yes, the size. It's not extra large, it's made to share but not a burden. It's honestly made with passion. We've never waited more than a few minutes for a table, we love bringing a good bottle and sharing a glass with the owner. If I want to eat pizza similar to this, I have to go back to Europe. I suppose for the moment East Liberty will suffice.   PS: the charcuterie is delicious and the seasonal salads are amazing.",

Pizza Taglio is easy to find right on S Highland ave I was able to park on the street which can sometimes be a challenge now I know this place is worth it,so look for a spot. I walked in place was hopping n popping there are only about 12 tables pinned the place wrong its not a slice shop but a nice sit down style place its noise of happy sounding pizza eaters was inviting  I was warmly greeted and assured I would have a table in 10 min or so  I felt comfortable as many of the tables are for two folks anyway 5 min later my table was ready remember this is a small operation so I was excited to be seated so fast  cold water carafe was instantly on my table I love when you don't have to keep asking for water. simple menu of Pizzas and since it was what I came for I was happy white pizzas and red pizzas  and something on the menu called hot honey pizza I'm not a hot person but I saw the honey in a bowl at the neighbors table me and hot are not friends started with the arugula salad generous portion of leaves and nice cherry tomatoes with a big hunk of burrata cheese.   I had a margarhetia pizza it was just about perfect pizza wise  thin crust perfect crispy crunch edge just wish the bottom had more crisp to it it was a little mushy.. yum sauce and basil leaves for a perfect combo all the pizzas are personal size which was perfect for me  14 for my pizza the others varieties are only a buck or two more. like I typed its not a slice place but a great place to sit relax and really enjoy your meal. service was spot on  30 dollars is not cheap for one person dinner but it was worth it the pizza the salad and the service I would gladly come back",

We had a table in the window, good service, no wait and a cheap date because we shared. I recommend. We even found street parking in front of the church.

The assortment of artisan pizzas at Pizza Taglio were some of the most creative and delicious I have tasted. Tony's  array of cheeses and aged meats served up on rustic homemade crusts reminded me of my travels to Italy. The spicey honey condiment added a surprisingly tasty twist. We ended the meal with some sweet and creamy spumoni, complements of the chef. Whether you are passing through on business or have lived in Pittsburgh your whole life, I highly recommend you visit this new Pittsburgh treasure for a relaxing and delicious meal!",

The waitress was very nice and said they would be on the house because of the wait.  We thought that was very nice. I got a white pizza with ricotta and arugula and the H got red with sausage. They were both good although some of the arugula on my pie was soggy and turning slime like when it sits too long in the bottom of a produce bag. No biggie. Easily removed.  We each loaded up on red chili flakes for some kick.  The check arrived and nothing was comped.  I felt too awkward to bring it up or make a scene.  Oh well.",

The crust was wonderful - a little chewy but still crisp on the bottom of the pie. I was not impressed with the arugula salad, since the balsamic drizzle was a little too heavy and syrupy, but for the pizza, I give them 5 stars.",

It's a nice little pizza place with a very small and simple menu. Ether white or red with X toppings on top. I can't for the life of me remember the name of the pizza we got but it was very very good. It had that soft yet crispy brick oven crust with a wonderful tomato sauce and smokey mozz. This was one of the better pizzas I have had in the US. I mean even the pizza is Rome and Tuscany has a run for it's money with this place. The waitress was nice and very attentive. The guys making the pizzas were also very friendly. I also enjoyed the French windows. We got to sit right by them and enjoyed people watching. This Place is a must try and a good price for the amazing quality of pizza they make. I will be going back here again and again as long as my wallet allows me to.",

The pan sized pizzas need more sauce on them. And the crusts are too big. Because the crusts are so large (by the miracle of physics) gravity forces all the sauce downwards to the center. Thus creating a soggy shit show in the middle, much like the Drumpf presidency. If I wanted to pay $16 to eat dry dough I could go to Whole Foods and buy a baguette. I'd save $15...or I could also just ask a Drumpf supporter to punch me in the face, again, saving me $15.",

I got the hot honey on the side since my hubs didn't want to try it & it was amazingly delicious! It was spicy to me but I kept dipping my crust in it. A little misleading on the alcohol yes, beer & wine info on this Yelp page. It's actually BYOB, I guess I should've read more reviews. I was also disappointed that they no longer make the Nutella calzone as that was one of the reasons I chose to come. It also isn't that great for kids if they are as picky as mine. My boys really enjoyed the plain pizza but didn't like the extra blob of fresh mozzarella & my daughter wouldn't eat it because of that - these kids are something else...sigh. Anyway, I would've loved to try more flavors but it was filling & I had save room for dessert.",

    "text": "Update........  It's been a month since Pizza Taglio opened. We have returned three times since. The last time was this past weekend and things have changed for the better. First if all, I was amazed how much faster Tony made the pizza. He handled a room full of orders like a pro and we received our pizza in no time. Secondly, I was impressed of how much more improved and attentive the service was this time. Our server was a short haired blonde and she bent over backwards to make our experience a good one. We were also stunned how the other servers were also helping with water, asking if we needed anything and clearing our plates. Bravo for Tony for creating a team attitude for service excellence and improving so much. Food wise.... I tried his white pizza named 'Jackie' this last time. I am not a white pizza kind-of-guy but that truffle made that pizza to die for. I know I was taught not to end a sentence with a preposition... But it's pizza we are talking about!!!! It was fantastic. Do yourself a favor and go for it! You have to have the mindset of old world Italy when eating here. The owner will come to your table and make you feel like you are family while you are eating the best ingredients you can buy. If something isn't right, he will take care of it! Treat yourselves this weekend..... You will not be disappointed.",

Marie had a white pizza with arugula and tomatos etc and she liked it same. We got the antipasta dish of cheese and charcuterie...  And they did not have bread or anything to eat with it??  If you go with a European style...  Then does miss on the basics. Dish Not cheap and not a lot either so value to price not good...
