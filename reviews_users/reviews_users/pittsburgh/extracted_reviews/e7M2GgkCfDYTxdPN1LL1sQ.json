The presentation of the food was far above average, a visual delight surpassed only by the superb taste.  For those reasons alone a 5 stars rating is warranted. The simple, efficient atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. Convenient access on a busy downtown street. Looking for a delicious Chinese meal at a surprisingly reasonable price? Wai Wai Chinese Cuisine will not disappoint you. I look forward to many more visits to this gem of a restaurant!",

    "text": "The best cheap Chinese food in Pittsburgh, hands down. Their menu is typical of any cheap Chinese food joint. General Tso's chicken, chicken and broccoli, Szechuan, and other Chinese food regulars are here. Prices are also typical of most Chinese food joints. Most dinner dishes are under or around $10.   The dinning experience is actually pretty decent. Located in Bloomfield, it's certainly in a prime location. Their are several tables in there, though I've never seen that place packed. It has a quiet atmosphere other than hearing whatever the employees are talking about. I tend to do take-out as most of their customers do.   They deliver pretty quickly and their food is always made to order. I'm kinda mad that we couldn't get a double order of veggies but I guess they have to have some faults. The food portions are huge and I almost always have leftovers. There's got to be pounds of chicken in the General Tso's chicken and the sweet and sour chicken dishes. Chicken and broccoli comes with tons of broccoli too (which I love).  Overall, this is my favorite Chinese food in the the 'Burgh. They are even willing to deliver out to Millvale sometimes which is an added bonus. You should definitely hit this place up if you're in Bloomfield and you get the urge for some delicious Chinese food at a great price!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.waiwaipgh.com%2F&s=ef8770595802882abfa08b700611d700e9d2125961d0de2a1cb9cdef5385321b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">waiwaipgh.com</a>",

    "text": "It's sad, but I think this place has really gone done hill over the last year or so.  I have lived in Bloomfield for three years and ordered from Wai Wai regularly during that time.  Recently, the food quality has taken a dip in my opinion.  Worse, the delivery driver can't seem to remember to bring silverware and sauces anymore.  This culminated in two recent bad experiences with Wai Wai.  I stopped by for takeout Friday morning on my way home.  I ordered and waited 35 minutes for my food.  Normally, they take 10 minutes or so.  The place was completely empty, but the kitchen took forever to make my food and the one other person who was also waiting.  I was offered a $2 credit for the wait, which was fine by me.  When I got home, the food was not what I ordered.  I received some sort of soup instead of my crab rangoon.  I called and they gave me a $5 credit as well.  Neither of these credits were refunds, only credits that could be applied to a future order.  That is understandable on the $2 waiting credit.  However, when I don't get food that I already paid for, I should be refunded, not issued a discount on a future order.  I shouldn't have to buy more stuff from you in the future in order to be compensated for food I paid for but never got.  Today was the most frustrating part.  I called to order delivery today and take advantage of my credits.  However, Wai Wai refuses to let me use both credits on one order.  In order to take advantage of the credits I got because they screwed up my order, I have to buy from them two separate times?  That is not okay with me at all.  Despite my protests, the woman on the phone refused to apply both credits to my current order so I am now forced with the choice of losing that $2 forever or giving these people more money.  I guess I will choose losing the $2.  I'm saddened because I used to really enjoy Wai Wai.  The food was good, quick, and inexpensive.  Now it is mediocre, slow, and inexpensive.",

    "text": "When I lived in Bloomfield I LOVED ordering from Wai Wai. I'm talking 5* up and down, but oh how times have changed. These are my last 4 experiences (in a row):  1st I tried to order vegetable won tons, but they were out. Tried to switch to vegetable dumplings. Also out. I know things happen, but are you just out of vegetables? If so, tell me that maybe? I rattled off a few more vegetarian options to no luck and an employee so rude I decided I'd just take my business elsewhere.  2nd time I ordered successfully, but somehow going from Bloomfield to Squirrel Hill (under 15 min drive) took 90 mins instead of the 45 I was told. I called 3 times and was met with nothing but attitude. My $10 food was cold when it arrived, and this was the first time I noticed how much smaller the portions had gotten (this was 2012 compared to 2009-2011). There was no refund, no apology, and to top it off the order wasn't even correct. That's when I decided I'd never give them another dime.  3rd time was a work order and, long story short, NOTHING we ordered was right. The food containers look like they literally THREW them into the bags. It was pathetic.  And finally, the most recent time my roommates ordered \"Fried\" pork dumplings. Apparently in this restaurant \"fried\" is just another word for \"steamed\" and when they called back to report the mistake the response was \"That's just how they're made, we're really busy. If there isn't a 'REAL' reason for you to call I need to go. Sorry for your misunderstanding.\"  Seriously? I'd suggest literally ANY restaurant in the city before this place. Horrible customer service and the food isn't even as tasty as it once was. Really sad to see such a great Chinese place become one of the worst I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with.",

A notch above the Chinee-Takee-Outee experience -- I get that name from an actual Chinese take-out in Gainesville, Florida -- but a notch below a full-fledged Chinese restaurant, I was drawn in by the familiar architecture and the promise of Bubble Tea.  I ordered the Taro Bubble Tea without sweetener. Same exact flavor as Lin's and so I was quite happy. Just need almond or pineapple and all would be right in the world (hint, hint.)

While we were eating, the one, I'm guessing she was a manager,  ran around with a broom chasing the mice away. She did apologize but would not look us in the eye while doing so.  There was no discount given and for the quality,  the food was way over priced.  They did give us a coupon for a whopping $3 off our next purchase of $21 or more.  We were less than satisfied with our meal, and the show that went along with dinner was not appreciated.  Needless to say we will never be dinning at this establishment again.

They've got a strikingly modern decor with traditional Chinese art, so it's kind of like mixing a sushi place with an old school Chinese restaurant.    WaiWai has a lot of neat lunch options.  You can order the standard lunch specials just like you can at any other Chinese joint.  Or you can order one of 12 lunch boxes.  The boxes generally have two types of meat with fried rice.  Not a big fan of fried rice myself, but I did find one good choice.  #B6 is a combination of chicken, beef, or shrimp (I went with the shrimp) with mixed vegetables and General Tso's Chicken.  Oooh, a bit spicy, but I loved it!  And of course you get an egg roll with each box.  This girl's gotta have her egg roll!  Rick and I are gonna have to come back here for dinner sometime.  They've got an interesting way to order.  You start by choosing your type of meat, then you choose the style you want it.  You can get Hunan Style with vegetables, curry, mixed vegetables, etc.  This isn't your normal neighborhood Chinese joint.  If Pittsburghers have a reputation for being less than culinarily adventurous, this place will shatter that illusion.  It's a great addition to Bloomfield.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: I'm not a big fan of Chinese to begin with, but my partner wanted to grab a quick lunch here. She had a cup of corn and chicken soup; I, the egg drop soup. When they came, we made sure that our server hadn't mistakenly given us the bowl size. She hadn't. In some places, a cup of soup is usually about two shots worth, but at Wai Wai, the cup is a very generous portion. I found the soup the best part of the meal, though it was probably nothing more than cheap chicken broth and shredded egg whites. The pot of jasmine tea was average and could have used a bit more flavor.   We shared an order of the honey chicken, again generously portioned. I realize in a place like Wai Wai, raising questions about MSG, as well as whether or not their meat is locally sourced and/or humanely raised (and thus healthy for the consumer) are somewhat unreasonable (even absurd) queries to posit. While my partner and I do care about food awareness and personal health, by choosing to eat here, I suppose we tacitly approved of sloughing off such concerns and slumming it for a meal. All this being said, the mound of honey chicken, surrounded by a ring of steamed broccoli and individual sides of rice, were uninspiring. I took a few bites, and didn't feel the urge to have anymore. Yeah, my aforementioned ethical concerns were the root cause of this, but the food was very middling. There was nothing terrible about it, but it was just your typical, Americanized, unhealthy Chinese food.   The server was attentive and friendly; we tipped accordingly. I wouldn't go out of my to dissuade the reader from going if he or she is a fan of standard Chinese fare, but I highly doubt I'll find myself in there again.",

I had the Lo Mien Shrimp Noodles and a another dose of shrimp in an egg roll. I like my Lo Mien tasty and full of the whatever meat or veggie you order and simple request was filled! And NO ONE wants a limp mushy egg roll, so thankfully mine was crisp and again, filled with some big pieces of shrimp. I always get nervous going into a new restaurant like I'm on a first date...and thank gawd my first date was a success, with the restaurant I mean!",

The chicken on a stick is also excellent, perfectly cooked and tender.  The rest of the menu is very solid good Chinese food with consistently good quality and portions.    Their only negative, which lost them a star, is their General Tso's Chicken.  I've ordered it a few times and its typically soggy and lacks any spice or heat instead coming off as an overly sweet almost honey barbecue type flavor.  Being my favorite Chinese dish I'm rather critical of it and theirs leaves much to be desired.    Overall consistently good food at a decent prices and I highly recommend trying them.",

It's sometimes hard to find good Chinese food that's not sketchy in and around this neighborhood.    The dinner boxes are awesome - $8 - $10 for what is easily 2 or 3 meals.  You can't beat that.  And the fact that it's BYOB is awesome.  My last visit was with my family to celebrate my brother's birthday.  We had 6 people, 2 bottles of wine and some beers and the service was great.  We left with a ton of leftovers, and the bill was incredibly reasonable - even with the corkage fee.  Speaking of, unlike a lot of BYOB places, this place charges a set $5 fee for the whole table regardless of how many people you have.  Personally, I think that's a pretty good deal.",

I've been ordering online and having it delivered too though they just added more fees.  There is a minimum order, a delivery charge, now an online order charge.  Overall, still a good place to eat.  My favorite Chinese food place so far in the city.  I want to give 1 star to their boba drinks.  They suck.  Their boba is undercooked and has no flavor.  *hint* add some brown sugar when cooking.  Also, the one kid that made it for me gave me a drink that was lukewarm.  Seriously,  I had to ask for them to add ice to it.  Luckily their food is still good.",

Food arrived, with no way to take a credit card, yet I wasn't asked if I was paying with a credit card when I placed my order, nor when I called back the second time to see if they needed my hotel room #, or would just call from the lobby. So, I didn't get a receipt, even though I was using a business card (and needed one for expenses). Not awesome.  On food, I ordered a cup of the hot & sour soup, yet the utensils I was given did not include a spoon - only a fork, knife, and chopsticks. Ummm. You know I'm American in America. And you clearly gave me the fork and knife, why not throw in a spoon? (I got one from my hotel.)  Soup was not tasty, btw.  Then there was the main problem: the entree - \"Happy Family,\" which was anything but happy. Poor quality chicken and shrimp (but those were the best). The beef was not good, and the pork was inedible. The scallops were also terrible.  Do not recommend (no matter the mis-perceived convenience).",

After witnessing co-workers nosh on Wai Wai's takeout fare frequently, Kay and I opted to dine-in there a week or so ago, and were pleasantly surprised by their swanky decor, friendly service, and above-par food.   We ALWAYS order Steamed Dumplings, and we do so because they're usually addictive (gimme two orders and nothing else and I could be happy), and WW's  meaty, doughy, stout version is not to be passed over.   For my entree, I requested the Sha Cha, which consists of onion, celery, a medley of vegetables including bamboo shoots, and mushrooms in the titular sauce with whatever proteins you choose. I went \"Mixed,\" meaning I got a nice helping of ably cooked and hefty poultry, shrimp, and beef chunks to go with my freshly-cut vegetables, fungi, and white rice. Overall, I enjoyed the dish, the sauce being particularly savory and dynamic.   I do not recall what Kay had other than the Mango Bubble Tea. I had a taste and uh, well...the gummi beans pretty much make the iced drink thing sing. Without the gelatinous beans, you're left with cloudy, bland Kool-Aid. I'm just callin' it as I taste it, kiddies. A fad? I wager it'll fade away in ten years.   NEXT ON  VH-1's I LOVE THE 2010'S...  B-List Celebrity Talking Head #1 (The soft-core porn actress/music video bimbo/centerfold): \"Remember bubble tea? It was so weird. Me and my friends loved it for some reason.\"  B-List Celebrity Talking Head #2 (The out-of-the-limelight sit-com actor): \"You had to drink it through this big, thick straw...\"  B-List Celebrity Talking Head #3 (Dorky comedian drinking some bubble tea): \"Sllluuuurrrrppp. Hmmm. This is strangely sexual.\" [Feigns choking on beans]  B-List Celebrity Talking Head #4 (Sassy, overweight actress/comedian): Boy, we need some Heimlich up in here! We never had that crazy shit in my neighborhood. Mmmhmmm. We drank us some Snapple or Ne-Hi.\"  And this is when I usually change the channel after finding no music...  P.S. A bunch of Anglo hipsters work the tables, oddly enough. They were all nicely efficient, however.",

We ordered delivery as we now live in the neighborhood... somehow Orange Chicken (which we had a discussion with them on and they said they could make with all white meat for an extra charge) became Mongolian Beef as it made its way to polish hill.  So basically, my husband was unable to eat what we had ordered for him and what had paid about $15 for.  Total disappointment.    My chicken and broccoli was good but the container was way too filled with sauce (I asked for light sauce which to me, meant less sauce, but definitely not to them).    I was really upset by this... we thought that we had a good Chinese option nearby and now we will have to explore or drive.  Cannot say we want to go back after this last debacle.

I suppose I should add that this was part of a large order placed for delivery.  With it being delivery and all that jazz, you would expect it to come with utensils or maybe even chopsticks.  None came with it, or maybe it did, the bag seems to have disintegrated when attempting to take the order to it's destination.

While we were there for around 1.5 hours, only one other group was seated but around 4 people came in to pick up their take out.   I came here with my family around 3:30, just past the designated lunch period, so we were stuck with the dinner menu. No biggie.   The waiter was super attentive and polite, timely and conscious of water refills. We all went with the plate sets which is cheap at around $10 for HUGE portions! None of us could finish. I ordered General Gao's Chicken with broccoli and beef and white rice. The food is pretty average to above average American-Chinese food, nothing really authentic here. Much better than Panda Express though! I guess the one authentic thing was the music they were playing, it was straight from the mainland. My Mom loved it.   Overall, the atmosphere was inviting, waitstaff was great, and the food, although not authentic, was above the average American-Chinese. Will probably drop by again!",

Since I've been back so often (really more often than I should be comfortable admitting, there have to be groups for this sort of addiction) I felt as if I should write a new review for them as well.   Let's talk drinks. I'm not a fan of sucking black tapioca balls through a giant straw so the bubble tea is not for me. I have had two different types of smoothies there, the mango and the pineapple. I don't know if it's a mix or something fresher that they use, but it's delish every single time. A drink being delicious isn't all though, it's also served in a nice big red wine glass and it's heaping over. I'm also a fan of the hot oolong tea.   The other topic I wanted to address is the crab rangoon. Dear sweet crispy cheese lord... I would have never tried it as I don't often eat anything other than fish here and there. I can't believe I almost didn't get the ultimate joy of eating these cheese hot crunchy fried triangles.  As always I'd very strongly suggest stopping in here. Eat some crispy triangles and have a smoothie!!",

The food is OK and it's cheap with nice sized portions, where you'll most likely have some leftovers. The meals I've had are typically what I would expect of fast-food American Chinese food. I've had the General Tso's, Chicken & Broccoli and Shrimp Lo Mein and a few others and they were all good. My favorite part of the meal was the Crab Rangoons. You can't go wrong with fried dough and cream cheese, but I've been very disappointed at other places where they are dry and practically empty on the inside. Their rangoons actually have a good amount of filling.   Good for a quick, cheap meal.",

I try not to order General Tso's too much because it is basically a heart attack on a plate, but I was in the mood so I went for it. It's one of those things that whenever I order it I'm usually disappointed, but this dish was the exception. I don't think I've ever experienced such crispness from any other General Tso's. Since I ordered a dinner box I also have the chance to try the steamed shrimp, egg roll, and rice. I'm not much of an egg roll fan but it was pretty good and the steam shrimp was among the better I have had in the city. For eight bucks I'd eat it everyday if my heart could take it!",

We were pleasantly surprised that the sauses were NOT at all goopy, gloppy, or gelatinous. It seems that so much chinese food has sauce that is more like jelly than sauce.  We also each got a chicken egg roll. Delicious, and different. I've never had a chicken egg roll before. Chicken was flavorful and not bland.  Delivery time through grubhub was timely.

Innywho, the service was entirely too slow for a place that only had one other table when we first got there. The Oolong tea I had was great until I got down to the bottom of the pot, and there was a very distinct metal flavor. It also took about half an hour for our food to be served, which only added to my annoyance.   The only thing that made this trip better than my previous trip was that my portion was huge and I the dish I had (Beef Chow Fun) was delicious! It was so much that I had to take some home, and I'm always a girl who can finish her plate.

I used to order consistently from Wai Wai and loved their food but stopped  after a bad experience. I placed an order at 10:30 on a Friday night. I asked if they were still taking orders and the receptionist  cheerfully told me yes. I asked for a large shrimp fried rice and to shrimp egg rolls. I got one large chicken fried rice with very bland chicken in it. I suspect it was boiled for time. The shrimp egg rolls barely had any shrimp in it. My boyfriend is a pescatarian (strictly fish and vegetarian eater) so he couldn't eat anything I got. I really wasn't interested in it either, and as the dinner cost 20 dollars after the tip. I felt like I wasted my money. A friend that also ordered there had a similar experience when she ordered at around 9 pm.

If you order a tofu dish it will be swimming in grease though.  Their food is also consistent, and sometimes you want crappy chinese food and you want the crappy chinese food you know.

Slivers of carrot and something that I'd guess to be Chinese celery - were crisp and flavorful.  My shrimp in the \"shrimp in lobster sauce\"  were very large and they \"snapped\" when bit or cut into - the mark of fresh and appropriately cooked shrimp in my mind.  It came to the table only luke warm, we asked for it to be heated, and it was, without the shrimp getting overdone. Our chicken/pork/shrimp noodle dish was perfectly seasoned and flavorful, though the shrimp in this dish were smaller - and didn't have the snap.  But the noodles alone carried the dish. The tea was served in a small metal pot - which looked really \"authentic\" and added some beauty to the table.   The waitress who did the entire shift with just one helper (who didn't actually take orders, but she ran dishes out and cleaned tables) for a fairly sizable lunch crowd  was  attentive and friendly.  She knew the menu well and seemed confident and competent.  before we left, we made sure that she knew that we not only enjoyed the food but also appreciated her friendly service.  the decor is pleasant without the \"traditional\" bright red trappings of some Asian restaurants. This was the best Chinese lunch we've had in a very long time.  Left overs will make a 2nd lunch tomorrow! We were glad that the groupon took us there!",

I ordered General Tso's chicken and I was surprised at the lack of quality. The general tso's sauce was  not flavorful and very runny. Also, usually General tsos chicken comes with broccoli. This dish came with carrots and peas that definitely came from a freezer bag because the carrots were chopped up into little squares. I hardly ate my dinner and our waiter didnt say anything about it. He asked if i wanted to take it home and I said no, he just took the plate and handed us our check.   I may try Wai Wai again because of past visits, but I was just very surprised to see the quality of food deteriorate like it did.",

What was once a friendly personable staff has been replaced with rude abrasive workers.   Eating there one Saturday night I was shocked to see once professional attire replaced with the most casual attire most would not wear even to a convenient store. Sweatpants and trashy tops are regular. If the hygiene looks as bad for the cooks as it is for the waiters then I am terrified to know how they prepared my food.  After cancelling my order one day due to a long wait time I couldn't make, the one cashier became flustered and refused to speak to me. Instead going around back to finish a mild temper tantrum.   While waiting for my food, I overheard the staff speaking negative things about what they don't like about other customers and people trying to order food over the phone. This happened on my last two visits.  Finally. Once you pay for your order, the staff forgets you exist. After thanking them for my late meal, they nearly ignored my politeness multiple times.  Over the past year each visit to Wai Wai's left me feeling sour.  I can say after consecutive terrible experiences that I will not be returning to Wai Wai's.",

The hot and sour soup was the bomb, best in town we think.   Dumplings also top knot has and hit the spot. We did the seafood soup which was new so first ever as this has not been offered in other places. With so much food we shared the honey chicken. Could be a little bit hotter and broccoli steamed, but again this was a dish not offered at our other traditional places. Chicken crisp was just right and honey hit the spot. A definite return. Like almost many good Chinese places they probably do more takeout where seating is offered and not crowded.the place atmosphere was very family cozy.",

The interior is a step, or several, above most budget Chinese places, and the service is always good. The dinner boxes offer an excellent value: two entrees, fried rice, and a giant eggroll for under $10. The lunch box is even cheaper. I love their won ton soup and crab Rangoon too (mainly because they taste more of onion than crab...just how I like it!). The General Tso is great, super crispy, and my husband was really impressed by the chicken on a stick. I love that the fried rice doesn't have egg in it, but is loaded with meat. Yum!",

And they don't even go together. Shrimp w/ broccoli, General Tso's and orange chicken over chicken fried rice. Want to 'upgrade' that chicken fried rice to pork fried? That'll be $3 extra.   Quality: Rice was horrible and hard. Definitely tasted undercooked. Shrimp was mushy and seemed old. The only redeeming thing was the egg roll which was perfect: crisp, good filling, and not greasy.   I wouldn't go back. And you shouldn't give it a try either.",

Usually, coconut shrimp has a light batter and tastes of toasted coconuts.  This however, was creamy and way too heavy.  I asked the waitress what the sauce was made of and she said \"mayonaisse.\"  So, the shrimp was sitting on my plate covered in gloopy mayonaisse.  There is a coconut flavor to it, which is good, but I can't bring myself to eat it.  The heavyness of it and the way it sits in your stomach.  I think mayo should be left to topping burgers and sandwiches with, not part of entrees!  Anyways, I explained this to the waitress and she comped me and let me order something else.  I think that they fell gracefully at least.  It does make me question this place quite a bit though moving forward.",

It is probably fair to say that their menu is too extensive and geared to the western palate (they try a number of asian dishes that may be beyond their ken).  My kids love their chicken on a stick and crab rangoons--and I like them as well (much as I hate to admit that I like pseudo chinese food with deep-fried wontons filled with crab flavored cream cheese--cream cheese?  Cream cheese in asian food?).  The Crab Rangoons are quite honestly an abomination, but a yummy one at that.",

Having said that I think that Wai Wai is a great chinese restaurant mainly because their ingredients are always fresh. I hate eating chinese food that tastes like its been reheated and the chicken is old. You wont get that here. I got delivery or take out from Wai Wai rather frequently and the quality was always consistent. I gave four stars because I tried a few dishes that weren't the best I've ever had but in general and especially in Pittsburgh, I think its a great chinese restaurant. Very tasty and very FRESH.",

    "text": "so, i have been to wai wai in the past and i have usually found it to be average tasting chinese food.  My husband loves it, so we tend to go when i am feeling especially loving towards him.  Today, i decided to have delivery since nothing is better than packing for a move with chinese food and beer. I order us up some chicken corn soup, general tso's chicken, hot and sour soup, and orange beef.  Now i usually get tofu or chicken, but I was in a super carnivorous mood, so i thought beef would hit the spot.    the hot an sour soup, once i picked out the canned mushrooms, was delicious.  it was the orange beef that did me in.  when inspecting it with the plastic cover as a barrier, it looked like this strange bumpy chicken.  Weird, but i have seen chicken fried steak, so i just assumed it was battered.  I put some on my plate with some rice and dug in.  This was some NASTY ASS MYSTERY MEAT!  It was slimy, soft, and not fibrous at all.  This hit the spot on my tongue that almost made me projectile vomit.  I have had orange beef before and this was no orange beef.  this was sugary Purina 1.  I didn't even have to chew, it had a mind of its own and snuck its way into my tummy.  My husband saw how displeased I was and offered me some of his General Tso's and it was soft yet gristly.  what the hell.    I know for a fact that they would not serve that crap in the restaurant because i have eaten there.  this meal was a mess, a luke warm, zombified pile of crap.  Maybe I ate beef brain instead of Purina 1, either way, it was the pretty gross and disappointing.  This is honestly the worst chinese food i have ever had, and i have been to seriously  grungy looking places.  I gave you guys 3 years of business and i have seen you get worse with each year.  This is the last straw and I will never go back again.  There was no excuse for that beef when you are right next to 2 grocery stores!",

The first thing I noticed was that Wai Wai was nicely decorated.  Second, it was nearly empty on Wednesday night at 6PM.  The emptiness made me nervous.  Most of the time, a fancy, empty restaurant means one of two things: a) the food is bad or b) the service is bad.  Neither of these things turned out to be True.  The food & service were both fantastic.  Please note, though, I am not a Chinese food purist.  I love the Americanized version of Chinese food.  The crab rangoon was delish.  The wonton soup was tasty.  I ordered the chicken cashew entree & had enough food for lunch the next day, which was auspicious since my fortune cookie suggested I eat more Chinese food to stay healthy.  The dining room is BYOB, so if you're doing a date night, bring your own wine.",

    "text": "summary: clueless service, limited menu, mediocre food.  I walked into the place knowing that they serve Americanized Chinese food, so I am prepared for that. The rating is based on comparison with other restaurants of its type (the most mass-market example being P.F. Chang).    Wai Wai belongs to a new class of American Chinese restaurants that try to shake off the dingy \"takeout place\" image. The decor has a more modern sensibility to it than, say, Jimmy Tseng's. Think Starbucks meets Asian tea house. The menu, though, looked just like the one from a takeout place twenty years ago. Here you'll find things like pu pu platter and honey chicken. I was disappointed that the entree list was pretty basic. There were only four vegetarian options, and the content of the dish was pretty much just the single ingredient (e.g., a plate of stir-fried eggplant) which makes it look more like a side dish than someone's dinner.   The food was largely forgettable. The appetizers I tried (fried dumplings, spring roll, crab rangoon) were ok -- though hard to go wrong with deep fried stuff. I was underwhelmed by my main dish (the eggplant). The plate had an island of rice and an island of eggplant surrounded by a sea of brown sauce.  The sauce is overly sweet and goopy, but the eggplant itself had too little seasoning to stand on its own.  The one good thing about the food was that the vegetables were fresh and not overcooked. The string beans were still crunchy and the eggplant still vibrantly purple. The shrimp, however, was probably from frozen.  My strongest impression of the place might be the clueless waiter we had. As soon as we sat down, he asked for our drink orders, even though we didn't know what they had to offer.  The menu actually doesn't list their drinks, but the waiter didn't volunteer to tell us what they had. To order some tea, it took couple rounds of back and forth with the waiter to settle the matter. When ordering our food, I had some questions about the dishes (like, is the chow mein the thin and crispy kind?).  The waiter's response was \"I don't know, I haven't tried it.\" (Hadn't he served it to other customers? Was he not paying attention?) Upon further interview, it turned out that he had only sampled one dish of this restaurant, and he didn't have anything to say about even that dish.  Even a new hire ought to do better, surely?  Bottom line: even for American Chinese food, I've had better. If I should ever be struck by a craving for General Tsao's, I'd probably go take my chances at  Richard Chen or Plum or whatever Asian restaurant standing on that space then.",
