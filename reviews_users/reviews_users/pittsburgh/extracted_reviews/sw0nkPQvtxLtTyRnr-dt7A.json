I had two margaritas (which were pretty much all ice and I had to ask for more salt because there was practically nothing on the rim) and I got a bacon cheeseburger.   The bacon cheeseburger looked great but had absolutely no flavor and was kind of tough,  this was very sad to me as they used to have one of my favorite burgers!  We also got tableside guacamole and that was ok.  The saving grace was our server who was so sweet,  patient,  and awesome!  I am not planning on returning anytime soon.",

    "text": "Meh. Stopped in for dinner before heading to an appointment. Was by myself.  Ordered hot tea, they have only one kind - generic Tetley. OK, no big deal. I guess I was spoiled by Bob Evans and their selection of about a half-dozen teas.   Entree was Cajun pasta with grilled chicken. Came with a piece of texas toast. The pasta was overdone, the sauce was watery alfredo, and the chicken - although moist - was bordering on soggy, and it was quite tasteless. I would not recommend that dish, especially if you've had it at North Park Lounge where they do it very well. I was actually surprised how all aspects of the dish, other than the chopped green onions on top, were sub-par.  Before the entree arrrived, the server asked if I wanted more tea, delivered another cup of hot water, then asked if I wanted another teabag. Um, yeah? And he had to go back to get it.  My server was friendly and polite but not particulary attentive. Did not see him from the time my entree arrived until I was done eating.   Decor was nice and the place was clean.  Maybe some of their other meals are better, but I would skip the Cajun pasta.",

First, the salad that came with my Pick 3 was half size.  I was told that it was the correct size, even though the three previous times I ordered the same meal, it came with a full sized salad.  When I asked about this, the server, Hannah, gave me a blank stare.  She asked if I wanted to talk to the manager, and I said \"sure\".   Apparently she didn't hear me, because she just rang up my order.  I felt the temperature on one of my meals and it was cold to lukewarm. I asked what time it had come out, because I was there right at the time I requested the food to be ready. Hannah said that she just brought it out.  I said, \"well, it's cold\". Again, blank stare from Hannah. Finally Hannah asked if I wanted utensils. I said, \"No thanks.\"  She then put utensils in the bag.  All I can say about this visit is....I think I'll take my business to TGI Fridays.",

We had a good waiter who was willing to make some recommendations when we ordered the $20 dinner for 2. Overall it seemed to be a good value. The \"fried cheese\" that we ordered is just a clever name for cheese sticks (and not many of them). I think from some of our finer dining experiences we were imagining something a little more unique and less Giant Eagle freezer section. Our waiter recommended the Crispy Chicken Crispers. They were prepared well and the sauce was good.   There was a stink bug that was crawling across the booth as we ate, but the waiter I spoke to did not hesitate to remove it. Bonus points for handling it professionally.   Overall the food is just A-OK, hence the \"A-OK\" rating. It's a good place to go with friends when you need lunch or an easy dinner option.",

This time, a friend & I needed a place to grab lunch to kill time during a car inspection and Chili's was nearby.  It was a pretty awful experience...The waiter was a very tall, very ditzy kid who gave such bad service I felt like he owed me a tip for putting up with him.  Not only was he super slow, but he bought us rancid spinach & artichoke dip.  It smelled awful, but we tried it anyway.  To quote my friend, \"It smelled the way it tasted--like feet.\"  Of course, our waiter was nowhere to be found, so we sent the dip back to the kitchen with the next server who walked by, and she was appalled by the smell alone and apologized profusely.  And when our waiter found out, he said, \"I'm sorry you didn't enjoy that dip.\"  Obviously.",

My family and I go out to dinner every Monday and for this particular week, we settled on Chili's, who we had never really an issue with.   We were there about 5:30 on that Monday and were seated after about 10 min (there was no one else waiting for a table, just us) Finally after being seated, we sat another 15min before our waiter even came over to get our drink orders. At that point, we had already knew what we wanted, so we ordered our food as well to save time from killing ourselves from having to wait again.  The food was the normal Chili's food, but slightly colder and more 'thrown' on the plate than usual. The waiter tried to be kind, but it seemed like he was waiting on more tables that he should have (either that, or he was going outside to have a smoke after each visit to our table).  Overall, We were highly dissatisfied with the speed, quality, and customer service of this location.",

    "text": "Today I came here alone and this feels like a different restaurant. It's a Monday on a cold day so it's slow here at 5pm.  The waitress shows me the screen and shows me how to use it. From the screen I can see some stuff but not all, and the prices are not shown so I go to the menu. The waitress is great but because it is slow, she checks with me every 1-2 min to see if I'm ready.I order a skillet queso right away. What came was a fry pan with some orange/brown sauce with little lumps of meat (?). I though this was a mistake and after I had tasted it to see if I wanted it (yuck) I called the waitress over and told her it wasn't Queso and I didn't want it. She said it was how they made it. I told her it was like no other Queso I've ever had, I didn't like it and she took it back, although they did charge me for the chips and salsa which I didn't order.  After She then checked with me 3 more times to get me to order so I ordered a burger, that's as far as I had gotten in looking over the menu. The burger was out right away and I asked for a little mayo. I get that just in case the meat is dry. This was a very dry burger. I had trouble because the knife was dirty and I asked for another and it too was dirty so I used a fork because it looked clean. The fries that came with the burger were cold and dedicated and I didn't eat them. I can't believe how bad the food quality   has gotten here. I think this may be the last time for this place.",

    "text": "So wanted to try something a little different (as chains go) on McKnightmare road, and as I have not been to this Chilis in quite some time (and for the life of me I cannot figure out why... ) I thought we would tie on the feed bag here tonight, and this visit to Chilis is NOT starting off well.   The hostess is CLUELESS!! She could not buy a clue with all of the money in Brooklyn. My wife, mother in-law, twin omnivores, and I have been waiting here about 40 minutes on a FIFTEEN minute wait. Every time that I question her, she tells me we are the next table. Next table where on the moon??  Once we were seated, things didn't get much better. The waitstaff (Jessica) was rather dismissive and (in my opinion) seemed put out. Getting her attention was slightly harder than finding and collecting hens teeth. What was also like finding hens teeth, was getting our appetizer. Waiting...and waiting... And did I say STILL waiting!!! 20 count em' 20 minutes later voila, here comes my appetizer WITH a dinner chaser. Yes dinner came right along with appetizer. Imagine that!!   The twin eating machines went with the little chicken crispers, corn on the cob, and lemonade and at $4.99 ehh it was kind of hard to mess that up. My wife had the ribs, and while it was nicely done I feel the size was NOT worth the price. She left very unsatisfied.  My in law had the turkey sandwich (which I will never understand) and it was zoo soo stuffed with meat, that she could not finish it. This was about the only positive experience tonight.   Finally my classic bacon cheeseburger. Just a word of advice. Don't waste your time and or money.  I finally realize while it has been such a long long since my last trip to Chilis. And I see why it will be a very long time before my next trip to this location. I gave them two stars because I have jet to eat at a one star establishment. I always say that I vote with my feet and my dollars. Rest assured it will be quite some time before either return!!",

I and the wife both agreed the service, the food, the place itself, beat most if the \"genuine\" tex-mex places round here.  I got the steak, rare, came out perfectly prepared. Wife got the carnitas fajita platter. It was tender tasty, and had a \"tower'o'condiments\" with it.  Total price, with steak upgrade, beer, and tip, $38.  About what I would have spent on a single dinner at the teppanyaki place I was planning on going to.  And another shout out to Jess, and the rest of the staff.  Back of house and front. I hadn't eaten at a Chili's in over four years. I am going here, instead of Snapplebees or TGI-Food, here on out.  Better than I thought it would be, VERY happy I came here. Pix to follow...",

    "text": "It is Chili's.  A chain restaurant.  Don't go expecting amazing, fresh and unique dishes.    We ate there on Superbowl Sunday about a half hour before kick off.  Which meant the restaurant was basically dead.  We had a \"server team\" that was taking care of us.  They were both attentive and quick with refills on water, pop and chips.  the only time that they took a while was when I asked for extra sauce for my chicken.  It took a lot longer than it should have considering the lack of crowd in the restaurant.  I tried one of the new \"healthy\" chicken entrees.  It was OK.  Chicken was moist and the guac and mango on the top added an extra flair, but I can't say I'd order it again.    I'm not the biggest fan of chili's, but my fiance loves it, so I know we'll be back.",

And glorious in all its high sodium, high calorie, add some guac to that, way.  And then something happened.  They serve the sides to the fajitas in the micro-cups.  A dollop of sour cream for my fajitas?  A dollop of guac?  Get real Chili's.  The chips are inconsistent, sometimes not salted, sometimes oversalted, sometimes cold, sometimes perfect.  The fajitas them selves are usually served with barely cooked green peppers and onions instead of the previously well caramelized peppers and onions.  Find something you really like?  It's probably been significantly changed, or is gone all together.  It's just not the Chili's I used to hold so close to my heart.  The service is always great.  I like the little tablet things on the table to close your bill, though I'm sure that is a bit difficult for the tech-challenged members of society.  The restaurant is clean and I like the decor upgrades.  But all these menu changes and tweaks need to be re-evaluated.  Chili's, I'll keep coming back even though I know I shouldn't.  Someday I hope you'll return to your previous glory.",

There weren't many at the bar itself (maybe 5 total, including us), but she had 3 high tops & 3 booths....all sat within 5 minutes. We (3 of us) had, between all of us, 4 bottles of beer, 3 shots, a rum & water and an appetizer.  The bill was over $60! 1 shot of fireball was $7....for 1oz shots! So over priced! I am not certain that we will be back, as we are very rarely on that side of town. I know I was shocked at the price of everything. I understand how corporate restaurants are, but I wasn't incredibly happy with our experience.",

There was no cheese in evidence. The server was argumentative when we told him we did not like the queso, but he did take it off the bill, replacing it with a charge for chips and salsa.  The vegetables in the fajitas were an amalgam of totally uncooked and burnt with a very bitter taste. They brought the tortillas out 5 minutes before the actual fajitas, so the tortillas were cold when the meal came. And the accompaniments were just tiny dabs of things on a small plate.  Definitely gone down hill.",

I ordered the Southern Smokehouse Burger that had bacon and onion rings in it. My husband ordered the fajitas with chicken and steak. We both enjoyed the taste of these entrees.

We were right at the location and the traffic on a Saturday was a bit much.     I had the most difficult time deciding what to order - the menu has everything!!!   I decided on the smoked Brisket, jalapeno cheddar smoked sausage and Ribs..  it came with fries, garlic bread and street corn.   I was sold as soon as I saw the street corn!!!   Its one of my favorite types of corn on the cobb!!    Of course I barely put a dent in the meal and took it to go.   Everything was very good.  I really loved the ribs the best.   My boyfriend got a sampler which was quite amazing too.  The crispy chicken crispers in the honey chipotle dipping sauce were UNFORGETTABLE!!  The sauce was so good.. I would have purchased a bottle to take home if were available.   Our server was amazing and on point.  It was a great visit to Chili's!",

    "text": "Today I went to Chili's with my family for my mother in law's birthday. The experience was less than satisfactory. Our waitress dropped a beer that someone in the group ordered, that had splattered and went all over me. I smelled like beer the whole day. The waitresses apologized but didn't seem so sincere about it. She kept saying \"I don't even know how that just happened\". The manager was nice enough to come up to our table and comp the beer and the two appetizers we had ordered.   When one of the people in our group stood up to use the restroom, he actually banged his head on the chandelier that hovered over the table. After just looking at it, the chandeliers are definitely placed way too low, and is a total hazard to anyone over 5 foot tall.   When I went to use the restroom, the stalls were extremely narrow. Not that it was difficult to get in and out, but it could make anyone who is claustrophobic quite uncomfortable. On top of that, half the dispensers in the restroom didn't work. One soap dispenser, and one paper towel dispenser just didn't work at all. The handle on the inside of the restroom was very wobbly, which gives anyone a fear that it's going to break off and leave you trapped in the bathroom for a while.   The food experience for our group was not great whatsoever. I ordered the Cajun pasta with chicken, which was quite good, but not spicy at all unfortunately. It tasted like normal Alfredo sauce tossed in penne and grilled chicken breast on top. It was good but wasn't spicy like anticipated, and it came with a piece of garlic toast that was burnt. Three people in our group ordered the same thing, sirloin steak, mashed potatoes and broccoli. They all claimed their steak was not cooked to their liking, the outside was really crispy, and just not that flavorful. The bacon bits on the mashed potatoes were totally fake looking and not crumbled fresh bacon. And the broccoli was way undercooked. Way too much of a bite when eating the broccoli. We had an elderly woman in our group that requested another vegetable besides the broccoli, so she ordered asparagus, which also came way under cooked. The last member in our group ordered a burger and fries, which he claimed were okay. Our appetizers were chips and salsa and chips with spinach queso dip. The queso dip was quite good, but the tortilla chips were horribly salty. The salsa was very salty as well.   Overall, I liked my dish, but my group didn't care for their meals. And between the beer spill and my friend banging his head on a chandelier, I was not happy. But at least they rectified the situation my comping multiple things we had ordered. I will give credit for that.",

It was kinda spicy, but otherwise alright. Again I wasn't wowed.   Before we left we decided to stop at the restroom. On our way back we saw into the kitchen. Now that was something I wish I never saw. It was filthy. There was food all over the floor. Food had spilled off plates onto the counter/silver kitchen apparatus.

    "text": "I feel bad giving this restaurant three stars.  In a nutshell, service was awesome, not because of our waitress, but because the manager and others were constantly stepping in to flawlessly help while our server was \"in the weeds.\"  Great/Awesome/Amazing team effort!!!    Thing is, there were a lot of open tables which leads me to believe that they had a \"tiny\" wait because they wanted to seem busy but were understaffed (common trick).  (My wife and I only went here as a last resort  because it was the only place with less than a 10 minute wait and we had a movie to see.)  I really wanted to love this place, but I just can't get past the \"chain\" crap food!  Service was fine, but the food kinda sucks given the alternatives in the neighborhood.   Conclusion: skip this place unless you are in a time crunch; there are too many other great places to eat at.",

We decided to try to again about two months and go and have either ate in or got take out at least 7/8 times since and every time it's been spot on and delicious! It's back to what it used to be. The chicken enchilada soup is amazing as usual! The fajitas are also great. The original chicken crispers are as good as they were years ago! My boyfriend usually gets a burger and is always satisfied. If you stopped going like us, I'd recommend you give it another try!",

    "text": "Why on earth did they change their fajita recipe?  Do they even use a marinade these days?  It was terrible.  Their chicken and steak fajitas used to ROCK!  Chips and salsa and margaritas good as ever but won't be going back just for that.",

Even when its busy our food always comes out within a reasonable time. The staff really cares about the customers here. My kids love this place!",
