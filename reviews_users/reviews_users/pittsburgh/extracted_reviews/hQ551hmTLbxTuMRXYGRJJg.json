    "text": "Wow !!! Some of the best local food I've had in a long time. Happened to spot the place while sitting at the red light on route 51 ... Yelped it and saw the great reviews. Decided to try it the next day and the reviews were spot on!  The wonderful smoked smell as soon as you walk into the place is the first thing that hits you. It has a very simple, clean and woodsy feel. Had the brisket and pork platter with coleslaw and cornbread. Meat was extremely tender and flavorful, and the coleslaw was absolutely delicious.  Their sauces were all very flavorful and I used them as more of a side for dipping since the meat was excellent on its own.  Restrooms were very clean which is impressive based on other food places I've been in (yuk).  Met the owner -- he was a bit quiet but I'll chalk that up to humbility. We will definitely spread the word on this place and WILL be back !",

We all ate a different meal. We ended up sharing just to get a taste of the other types of food. The food was priced for the amount that you get. You get a lot of food for your money. The ribs are fantabulous. The pulled pork and BBQ chicken were excellent as well. The meat falls off the bone. There are additional sauces if you choose to add more to your BBQ. It's not necessary, but a must try, as they are all tasty. The Mac n cheese and cornbread have a twist and also were very good. I totally recommend and will go back. They are also on GrubHub and deliver to several areas. I downloaded Yelp just to leave my first review. Try the brisket, brisket chilli, and coleslaw too. Very clean place as well.",

I usually think of bbq as an indulgence, which is the only reason I don't eat it all the time!  The Carolina mustard sauce and the the spicy sauce were both excellent, and I'm definitely a sauce snob.  Just the right amount of tang, heat and a dab of sweetness.  The brisket was flavorful and tender, and the pork wasn't gummy or dry, which a lot of places can't do pork well.  I'd definitely try some sides next time and hope the brisket chili makes a reappearance on the menu, soon.  Hope the word gets out and this place can stick around for the long haul!",

Coworker wasn't sure that was brisket, maybe actually a roast, but I liked it just fine. The mac 'n cheese was quite good and I liked the sauces. I would suggest a better offering of drinks, but that is a minor issue. Madison was friendly and provided good service with a smile. We don't come to Pittsburgh too often, but will probably return to Spilly's in the future.",

I've only lived here a year, so my husband and I have been slowly eating our way through all the BBQ places in Pittsburgh to find something close to home. We have incredibly high standards so I gave this four stars. But for Pittsburgh though, I'd probably give Spilly's five stars. Most places we've been to fall short. I've only tried the pulled pork, Mac and cheese, and cornbread. The meat was super tender. The sauces were totally decent. I'm always going to prefer vinegar based, but Spilly's does the trick when I'm craving southern BBQ. I'm also a traditional buttermilk cornbread girl, but the sweet cornbread with what I assume was a little jalapeno was fun. The prices are fair, and the ambiance is nice. I really liked the two vintage pinball machines. Lastly, it's always hard to find decent, non-chain takeout on this side of town when you just don't feel like cooking. I'm glad I can add this place to the short list. We'll definitely be back.",

We ordered The Big Meat and the Chicken & Rib Duo for three of us to share. For sides we had Mac n cheese, coleslaw, and baked beans. The close slaw is creamy but not sweet. It has a good crunch to it which stands up nicely to the meltiness (I just made that word up) of the meats. A lot of people are serving Mac n cheese but most of it lacks flavor. Theirs has a bit of crunchy topping and is flavorful. It's a great pick for a side. My favorite side, however, is the baked beans. They are smoked. I don't know if many places that have smoky baked beans. They compliment the BBQ meats.  The chicken literally fell off the bone. I picked up a chicken leg and I pulled the skin off to try it. BOOM! The meat fell off. The ribs had a great bark on them. The bones slid right out. The Brisket was some of the most tender brisket I've had. It was cut into cubes. It was easier to eat it that way. The pork was shredded and very moist. They were running Brisket Chili for $5. The gentleman working gave us three samples. It was meaty with a touch of spice. We bought a bowl to take Home for dinner. It will be perfect with our left over BBQ. We couldn't finish it. If you are a BBQ connoisseur you need to get here.",

First time I got the brisket sandwich, fantastic, and the second time I went with my wife; I had the half rack of ribs which were great, they fell right off the bone and my wife had the pulled pork sandwich which was also amazing!  They do BBQ right, they don't try to fancy it up it's just smoke and meat. The meat is the True star and they let it speak for itself.  They offer three sauces which are served on the side, original BBQ, spicy, and Carolina. I went with the original which was very good. If you want good BBQ  please give this place a try, you will not be disappointed!",

I got the ribs and my husband got the pulled pork, both were awesome! There's this delicious crusty outside to the ribs and the inside is still nice and juicy. And the pulled pork was moist and flavorful. And their sauce... I could have eaten the whole bottle, we only had the original, but they have a spicy and some kinda mustard one too. We got the Mac n cheese, baked beans, and corn bread as sides, all phenomenal. Everything's made by them and you can tell, everything flavorful and unique and I can't say enough good things. It is byob so if you want a beer make sure to bring it with you otherwise they have a nice selection of pop.",

Meat flavorful and tender but also has texture. Sides were great. All traditional bbq, Smokey, not sweet..perfect. they are in process of getting a liquor license too!! Not so much a place for kids..rather cool hangout 20's and up......one tip for owner: the signage (big cowboy that says Spillys) does not indicate a hip spot like they are going through, based on that I thought it would be a cheap tacky place..its doing a disservice to the clientele is imagine they are going for..",

That's a bad sign for sure. They were very careful however to hold up the IPad payment system to card-paying customers to make sure they saw the ENTER TIP HERE part of the screen.  There were only 4 other people in the place when I went on a Saturday afternoon, yet it took about 40 minutes to prepare my simple order. Another bad sign. There were 3 bottles of different sauces on the table. Each bottle was quite sticky. Another bad sign. The so-called Carolina mustard-based sauce was apparently nothing but Giant Eagle mustard straight out of the tube, with some relish mixed in. Yuck. Try visiting Old Carolina BBQ near Cleveland if you want to find a more legit version of Carolina mustard sauce within a day's drive, or wait for the Ribfest at Heinz Field.  Ok, now for the food. The Ribs were burnt, but otherwise reasonably good. It would be nice if they had knives (DUH!) but they only have plastic forks, so you kind of have to rip apart the ribs by hand. (yet another bad sign). A half bbq chicken was also ordered, but instead they served two legs. (yet another bad sign).  There were just way too many things wrong, I'm not going back.",

I thought $8 for just a sandwich with slaw was a bit high until I saw how big the sandwich was (not one of us ate the entire sandwich) and it was really good! The barbecue was 5 star worthy but the sides were not that great at all. Other reviewers bragged about the cornbread, but I was not a fan... it wasn't sweet and I barely saw a jalapeno flake? The beans & mac n' cheese were meh...  I will definitely return but for the meats only! Sauces were pretty good as well.

We sat at a table outside and After waiting about ten minutes a young kid brought a tray out and dropped it on the table and got in his car and left. He didn't bring our drinks or silverware etc. turns out It wasn't what we ordered so my husband took it inside and let them know that was the wrong order and asked for the drinks. We waited a few more minutes and the lady who took the order brings out a tray with the ribs and chicken and cole slaw but no Mac and cheese. While we waited for the Mac and cheese I noticed that we didn't get a half of chicken like we ordered we had two legs and thighs. I went back inside and asked for the half of chicken and she said \"we don't sell half chickens\" and I reminded her that is what they had on the menu and they should be more specific and she said \" no it says 1/4 chickens\" I then pointed to the huge order board behind her where it says half chicken and she then said \" you can have your money back if your not satisfied\". I said no that's fine. We ate what we had and the ribs were ok but the sides were not great and the sauces weren't great either. One sauce tasted like straight mustard the other two were just mediocre Bar-B-Q sauce. The bad attitudes and poor service ruined the meal and I won't return. Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews before stopping here or I would have seen that the chicken being misrepresented is an ongoing thing and I wouldn't have ordered it.",

I actually liked the chicken better than the brisket. And that's usually never the case. The downside to both sandwiches was the meat didn't have much flavor and was a bit dry. I had to add coleslaw and BBQ sauce to add flavor. You know BBQ/brisket is good when you do NOT have to add anything to it for it to be good. This was not that case.  The baked beans were good. Wasn't so crazy about the mac n cheese.  They really nailed it with the decor. Very rustic chic that would fit right in with any chic place in the city.  A plus is they have picnic tables outside you can eat at. I ate outside with my dogs, which is always great in my book when restaurants have that option.",

FYI, the cornbread had some jalapeno which gave it a nice little kick. The ribs were fall off the bone and they had a really nice char on them. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was their sauce, which seems to be a ketchup base. We got both the regular and the spicy and I couldn't really tell them apart. They tasted mostly of ketchup and vinegar and was rather tangy, which I prefer a sweeter sauce. However, I think the meats were relatively flavorful without the need for sauce.

    "text": "Some of the best ribs we've had, and we had a pretty good sampling from across the Midwest and the Carolinas. We're usually afraid to order ribs because it's so hit or miss. But we saw some good reviews so we decided to go for it. We went with the half order but regretted not getting the full slab after we had our first bite. Great flavor, really nice rub, and very tender. The pulled pork and brisket were also great. The sides, while there was a small selection, were equally tasty. We had the Mac and cheese, coleslaw, and meaty beans (which came with a corn bread muffin). It was also a plus that we could bring our own beverages (we brought in a couple of cold beers). Our food came out quickly and we had good service here. Will definitely be back whenever we come around to Pittsburg again.",
