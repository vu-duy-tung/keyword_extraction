The hummus is excellent, as is the lentil soup and FRESH stuffed grape leaves (most restaurants serve them from a can, but Aladdin's makes them fresh).  The service was great, the decor was really nice and cosy.  And don't miss the desserts - we had a carrot cake cheesecake that was to die for.  They also have outdoor seating, which is so hard to find!  This is one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants.",

My favorite meals are the Mujaddara Pocket or the Fatayer and Lentil Soup! The only annoying thing is they pre-make their tabbouli so that the oil is already added into their salads, which are highly caloric!!! If you're not on a diet, however, the baklava is sinfully delicious and you would never be unhappy having a meal here! There's so many options and you could go there day after day without getting tired of the food. :) The best service is the Aladdin's in Fox Chapel.",

We got shawarma wraps, falafel, the flavor savor combination with jasmines rice, lentil soup, hummus, and a pita pitza for our baby. The pitza was borderline yucky. The cheese was flavorless and she wouldn't eat it after the first bite. It needs some work. Maybe if it was fresh it'd be better but we did take it to go. The hummus really does need more flavor. More garlic maybe, I'm not sure. But, it is saved by the hot sauce that they make! It's outstanding! As is the garlic sauce. The shawarma wraps were good, especially with garlic sauce and hot sauce! The flavor savor was a nice representation of their food but I felt like some of my chicken was missing, like it was supposed to be a whole thigh but was only like half a thigh. The beef was good but I'm certain it was previously frozen. The falafel were fine although a tad salty and potentially previously frozen. It did satisfy our desire for Mediterranean flavors and we'll give it another try for sure. The restaurant was very clean and the ladies that helped me, including the Manager, were both very friendly and helpful.",

We asked to have all of the food come out together as we were in a bit of a hurry.  We inquired about our food at 12:50 PM when we noticed guests seated after us were served some appetizers.  We also commented that the gentleman who was seated just before us finished his meal, paid, and had left the restaurant.  Our server mentioned that our food would take longer because we ordered food that had to be cooked.  We sat and sipped on our drinks until 1:10 PM and we could not take it anymore.  We asked for our food to go.  The hostess/manager apologized and offered to throw in desserts.  We declined the desserts, and she comped the Kibbie.  We waited another 10 minutes at the front door as our food was still not ready.  As we walked out the door the hostess/manager mentioned that a trainee was in the kitchen, and that was the reason for the delay.  It was a frustrating experience, and I will not go back.  You cannot have a weekday lunch go an hour without any food.  It is inexcusable.",

Started with salads and hummus Both times and they were both very good. Had the falafel for lunch and the lamb for dinner and enjoyed both, especially the falafel.  Prices were very reasonable if not cheap. Overall I would say great value and very good food.   Only one thing keeping it from five stars- we ate outside and the patio was disgusting.  They have metal tables with a grid like pattern so food and drinks can spill through to the ground.  The problem is that if you look below every table there are stains on the bricks as if the place had never been washed.  I just couldn't get the stains out of my mind.  Just one pressure wash a year would solve the problem.  Wonder what does the kitchen look like?  Usually you can tell a lot about the kitchen from the bathroom but in this case after seeing the patio, I was afraid to go!   Overall give it a shot but eat inside and hope for the best.",

It's actually a date-worthy restaurant. Our server was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He checked on us often, refilled our drinks promptly, and brought the check quickly.  We started with baba gannoush which was perfect, although I wish restaurants like these would give you an upgrade from the standard 1000-in-a-pack plain pita to go with it. The portion was plenty for 2-4 people to share.  I had the Jasmine's Favorite rice with chicken tawook. Sooo impressed with this dish. The blend of beans, chickpeas, carrots, onions, potatoes, and other veggies and spices was spot on and the portion size was generous enough to take home a lunch-sized portion for later.  This will definitely be added to my list of places to frequent at Waterworks.",

I've gone twice, now, and have been disappointed each time. The servers are great. It's the food and the price of one tiny condiment that prompts me to write. First, the food. Twice, I have ordered the falafel salad, and twice I have been served less than fresh salad greens. Some had rust spots and other pieces were just limp. I don't know if it's because they have less traffic at this location, but there really is no excuse to serve anything but the best. With the salad comes the garlic sauce dressing. I ask for it on the side because that's just me. What you get is one of those little plastic cups that isn't even filled to the top. My estimation is that it's about two tablespoons of dressing, if that. Garlic dressing is thicker than most dressings, so what comes in that little cup is not enough for a salad of that size (or price). Each extra cup is $.65. I make this sauce at home, so I know a tiny serving like this doesn't cost that much.  The other weird thing about this place is the location of the restroom. You have to walk through the kitchen and servers' station to get there. Not only does this conjure bad dreams of germs wafting from the bathrooms through the kitchen, but I just don't want to see how clean or unclean the prep area, kitchen, or dishwashing areas are either before or after eating my food. There is another bathroom upstairs, and if I ever go back, which is doubtful, now, I will use that one.    I really wished for more from my two trips to this location, but I don't think I'll go back.",

The beef shawarma was delicious. The lavash was sufficiently thin and the meat was spiced well. It came with the crucial turnip pickles that I tried to make myself recently (but failed). And the array of deserts in the deli stand was enough to make my mouth water. There are vegetarian options for the lame among you, and my vegetarian companion said her sandwich was good too. The price is good, the food overall perhaps not as good as kassabs, but a solid second place. Perfect for a dinner and movie date since it's right by waterworks. Go on monday for the cheap movie tickets...look at me...now I am planning your life.",

Tonight is only the second time I have just left a meal sitting on its plate. I ordered the hummus schwarma plate, which consisted of 1) cardboard in a basket (\"pita\"); 2) hummus- not bad, actually; and 3) grizzled bland beef strips DIPPED IN CINNAMON. My boyfriend ordered the flavor savor sampler: 1) a few chicken strips, pretty good 2) hot sauce on salad, pretty good 3) \"mediterranean rice\" (bad buffet rice-a-roni vermicelli also DOUSED IN CINNAMON 4) gross sausage-and-other-components thing 4) falafel so full of raw spices it was actually gritty to eat. The food was not only badly prepared, it consisted of glaringly cheap ingredients. The restaurant was full, so maybe it was an off night? but given the quality and cheapness issues, can't imagine that's the case.",

    "text": "The rare Saturday I went to a movie meant that I could actually have time for good food at Waterworks, instead of just grabbing a wrap after a late Monday movie.   I was surprised by how large the space is. They even have a little upstairs seating area too. I was not lucky enough to go in nice weather, but there is outdoor seating. The space was simply decorated, but looked really nice. One complaint is that when we were there, it was really cold inside. I heard someone else say something to the waiter, and he mentioned that they unfortunately couldn't control the temperature. I don't think it would be like that every time, but I did wear my jacket inside.  My boyfriend and I split a small order of Baba Ganoush. The small was the perfect size for the two of us, and it was really good. My boyfriend never had it before, and he loved it. It tasted fresh and delicious. Then came our main courses. I tried the Kafta wrap and my boyfriend got a steak platter. The wrap was really good, and the meat was so flavorful and moist. It was enough for me since I had the appetizer, but I definitely would have needed a side if I had only ordered that. My boyfriend's steak was well cooked and I liked the rice that came on the platter.  I thought this place was pretty good, and the price wasn't too bad. I'd try here or one of their other locations again.",

    "text": "We have visited this location a few times. We usually go to the squirrel hill location. So we are familiar with the menu and always enjoy the food.  But this location tonight was not the usual quality we are used to from the Aladdin's Eatery brand.  Tonight this location:  1. Had in the booth behind us a non customer - female.. not eating or drinking - obviously a friend of the manager... she was sleeping at times.  2. The restaurant was very cold. The nice waiter explained they can't control the temperature or thermostat- and said it's just the way it is and in the summer it's extremely hot.  3. As we just started the main course - The food was ok until about 1/4 into my sifha... when I cut into it a long black wiry hair was embedded in it and came out on my knife.  The manager did come over to inspect it and said oh god that's a hair- I'll take it off the bill.  But he never returned? My boyfriend stopped eating his shish kabob with jasmine rice because he couldn't believe what was in my dish- made him wonder about what he was eating.  The nice waiter came back with the check . That's it. There was no offer to comp the whole meal or come back or dessert- or even offer another meal to me. Rather we were just sheepishly ignored by the manager and hurried/ shooed out? It was very unpleasant and disappointing.",

There has never been a wait here and service is always friendly. Im honestly not a big fan of their hummus, but their Baba (eggplant dip) is dynamite! It's super good and we love the pita too. I typically get a bowl of chicken vegetable soup with feta and a side salad. The lamb plate is so tasty ($15) and the rice with vermicelli, pine nuts, and cinnamon is such a good combo too. I've had their pita pizzas, rolled pitas, stuffed pitas too but I always go back to getting the lamb plate or soup and salad. We love their fresh smoothies and carrot/apple juice too! Give it a try... Oh and treat yourself to the diamond shaped baklava... Yummmmy!",

We've been twice, and have come away disappointed both times.   Positives: god service, clean, some meats are well cooked, the hummus is great, and freshly squeezed orange juice that is what it says it is.   Negatives:  1. For starters, I just don't understand how they can serve this really dry, generic pita without anything: no olive oil, yogurt, hummus, nothing. I've never encountered this in any Middle Eastern context. How can they do this?   2. Their salads are bad. Both times I've been served sub-par salad greens: wilting, dry, stale.  3. The lamb plate was a disappointment: too dry. I got a combo plate today, and the meat was very inconsistent: some medium rare, others well done. My husband's hummus shawarma plate had very well done meat. 4. Finally, I have a very bad aftertaste from the food today: something very canny and unpleasant. I think it may have been the meat or the vermicelli. Either way, we will not be going back. Which is just too bad.",

Beautiful presentation and those pickled turnips made for just the right color and crunch.  I also enjoyed their hummus and a side of their delicious hot sauce.  Their hot sauce is AMAZING!  While I was enjoying my lunch another couple came in--they were clearly regulars.

Our meals were very average, I ordered the Loubie plate, the rice was a little over cooked and it was very under-seasoned. When our server asked about the meal we weren't shy about saying it was just okay; however there was no followup on the restaurants end to acknowledge how things might have been better.   Perhaps it's this location? The squirrel hill location has never let me down both in service and flavor. I'm not sure if I would return to this particular Aladdin's location, but I would return to the Mt. Lebanon or Squirrel Hill locations.   Pros: price, cleanliness, value is fair for portions. Cons: taste, service and menu is very large (cumbersome).",

As someone else mentioned, a side would be nice to be included for the price. The pita is the thin pita for sandwiches- again, I understand the thicker ones aren't as healthy (like the fries).

The service is excellent and I always feel welcomed and comfortable here.  There's lots of vegetarian options to choose from, for example, they have a vegetarian combo in the appetizer section that is amazing.  I also love the smoothies, teas, and other drinks.",

The falafel itself was good BUT it was slightly overpowered by the crunch of both the pickles and the beets.... one or the other would suffice.   But the hummus. Wow. I honestly don't think I ever want to buy it from the grocery store ever again, theirs was THAT good. Creamy and fresh and delicious.   Oh and that hot sauce???? Sooooooo flavorful, definitely get it (on anything). I can't wait to go back!",

I had the tuna shawarma wrap that had the perfect combination of tuna and all the normal fixings and it was under $9.00. The Falafel was cooked to perfection with a crust on the outside and tender, moist inside. The hand made cucumber sauce was the perfect partner for this perfectly done side. I was also introduced to their cauliflower. Again, perfectly cooked. They were not too soft and not too raw, and the season makes it a perfect addition to any of their meals.",

The wraps weren't very thick (which can be nice because the proportions of ingredients are better that way), but with no sides it felt like a light lunch for the price. I liked the flavors (pickles were great), but it wouldn't kill ya to give us some French fries or something!",

    "text": "Happy Aladdin's client over here!  Had some friends over in early December before Christmas and picked up Aladdin's catering to go...ordered the hummus platter and the chicken mishwi platter.  The hummus platter was plentiful and we did not finish all of it split between 10 or more people,  It came with loads of pita bread too.  The pita bread was not made in-house.  They order it in bulk.  The chicken mishwi is served on rice and it was devoured!  It came with about 13-14 pieces of chicken and we probably should have ordered more.  Ordering was so easy...i called 3 days ahead and told them what time i would pick up....the manager brought everything to my car for me.  I tipped!  Next time will order less hummus, perhaps I will go with a couple orders, not the platter.  Needed more chicken mishwi.  That stuff is so dang good!  Overall, I love Aladdin's.",

Our server was knowledgeable and very helpful. Can't wait to go back. The hummus was indescribably yummy and the falafel was to die for. Also, probably best hot sauce we've had ever. If you're looking for a greasy, fattening meal, go somewhere else. If you want to eat interesting flavors and feel good after, give it a try. It's even BYOB!",

    "text": "This was my first trip to an Aladdin's & also my first time eating middle eastern food. We decided to stop by on a Saturday. I introduced my friends to Waterworks Mall (more importantly, Five Below!) & then we decided to have a late lunch here since our one friend is actually from Egypt- we figured he could help us order.  We ordered the Kibbie & Dawali as appetizers. Wow, the Kibbie was great and full of amazing flavor. I truly didnt know what I was missing until I tried that! Our friend joked around that his mother can make it better, but I really don't know how. Aladdin's Kibbie was pretty tasty. The Dawali was okay.. a little too sour due to too much garlic & lemon (a little goes a looong way) but we put it on our fresh pita bread and made it work. Not too bad at all.  For lunch, I ordered the Flavor Savor Special which is Chicken Mishwi, Beef Kafta, seasoned rice, salad & hummus. Now that's a True flavor savor! I enjoyed everything & became full pretty quickly from our double appetizer. I only finished half & the waitress was kind enough to box it for me & add SUPER fresh pita. Bobby enjoyed it later after missing out on our awesome trip.  Overall, the food was flavorful & filling;. The service was okay & we had a nice time. I debated on giving Aladdin's a 3 star for an A-ok rating, but the fact that they make  really fresh food plus have many options for GF & vegetarians knocks it up a notch.   Good times!",

    "text": "I never thought I would like Middle Eastern cuisine, but after lunch at Aladdin's, I'm a changed woman!  This location isn't far from my office, and Aladdin's is perfect for a light, inexpensive lunch.  On my first visit here, I got the Aladdin's Favorite combo.  This comes with lettuce, tomatoes, vermicelli/rice, Beef Kafta, Shish Kabob, and Chicken Tawook.  I believe the price was around $13-14, but it was well worth it.  The portions are decently sized and just enough to satiate my lunch cravings.  I went again today and my coworker and I split an order of the grape leaves to start. Oh. My. Goodness.  I had tried grape leaves at a potluck once and HATED them. I swore I would never eat them again... until today.  Aladdin's serves theirs warm with a side of pita and topped with olive oil and feta cheese.  They were so good that I honestly considered ordering another plate as my entree!   I was craving lamb though, and ordered the Aladdin's Lamb Rolled for lunch.  It was the perfect size and only $8!  It was filled with lamb, veggies and Tahini dressing. Yum, yum, yum.  Service is quick (I think we waited maybe 10 minutes tops each time for our food), prices are great, and the flavors are amazing.  One recommendation I definitely have to make is to try the zesty sweet tomato dressing OR cilantro vinaigrette when ordering a salad. I tried both when I had the Favorite Combo and kept alternating dipping my fork in them before each bite!",
