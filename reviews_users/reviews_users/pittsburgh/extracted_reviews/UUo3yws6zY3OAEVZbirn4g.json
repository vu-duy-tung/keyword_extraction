I paid $6.50 each for SMALL 8\" or so - smushed bread, hardly any meat and wilted lettuce hoagies!!  Are you kidding me?!  What a rip off!! I have ordered hoagies from all over the place for these types of fundraiser functions as well as sold hoagies for years as a child. THESE HOAGIES ARE THE MOST PATHETIC hoagies I've ever seen or eaten!!  You should be Embarrassed and ashamed to even be selling these!!!  What a joke!!   I will NEVER be purchasing or eating from Peppi's ever again.  Horrible!",

I got the \"Ultra\" Cheesesteak and my husband tackled The Roethlisburger. We also ordered a large order of cheese fries. The fries seem hand it and the cheese to dip them in is the perfect mix of salty and cheesy. The real standouts, however, were the sandwiches. First of all, they are HUGE. They come with lettuce, tomato and mayo. My hubby and I are firm believers in not messing with the way people suggest you eat things so we got our sandwiches with everything they recommended. The meats on both sandwiches were so tender and flavorful. The cheesesteak was the best sandwich I've ever had. My husband loved the \"#7\" so much that he ate until he was over-full. It was a tiny bit spicy and so very good. Don't miss Peppi's. It is perfection",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  I was brought in by the claims of how large the \"RoethlisBurger\" is by vendors and other shoppers in the Strip District and I had to see it in person.    Peppi's has a dive-y sort of place but in a good way.  The flat top grill is behind the counter in the front and the back of Peppi's has a couple tables and booths with Steelers paraphernalia on the walls.  I wasn't too hungry so I ended up ordering \"The Phantom\", which was a cheese steak with grilled mushrooms, onions, and a fried egg.  My companions got a mushroom cheese steak and the famed #7, the \"RoethlisBurger\" itself.  All the sandwiches come with the basic fixin's of lettuce tomato, etc. and are a foot long.  The Phantom was a little smaller than I expected, but the flavors of the ingredients in the sandwich melded together wonderfully.  My only complaint is that I would have liked a little more meat.  After some searching online, apparently all their steak subs only have a quarter pound of steak.  For some reason based on the picture of the RoethlisBurger in the window outside we thought it was going to be a lot bigger.  I guess camera angles can be deceiving.  It's a mix of chopped burger and sausage with American cheese and a fried egg.  Overall I would have liked it a bit more if the sandwiches were served a bit faster (some people who ordered after us got their food first) and a bit more meat.  Anyways, I'm definitely going to be back to try the RoethlisBurger since now I view it as a potentially tasty sandwich as opposed to just a ridiculously impossible food challenge.",

The bread is too small for the sandwich, the meat tastes weird (especially their 'cheesesteak'), and I just don't feel the love for a heaping handful of french fries stuffed onto a sandwich.  The taste of potatoes shouldn't dominate one's sandwich.  Peppi's is the creator of The #7 (nicknamed The Roethlisburger in homage to Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger).  It is an extraordinary combination of hamburger meat and sausage (and they use some of the best tasting sausage available) with American cheese mixed in on the softest of rolls.  Really, Peppi's uses the best bread for their sandwiches and that, in my opinion, is what makes a sandwich.    Located in the Strip District, you can shop your extra sandwich weight off after lunch by visiting any of a few dozen specialty shops in the historic district.    Yinz'll love it!",

The staff there is young and more than friendly. I always enjoy a place with self-serve drink fountains since I am one of those people who usually pisses off a waitress since I'm in need of refill after refill during my feast!

Always heard raving reviews about this place before going to Pittsburgh and had high expectations but when I took a bite of the #7, the Heath, and the Porter, all expansions were blown away. These sandwiches are something I wish I could live off of. Service is great and even after ordering 6 sandwiches with my dad and uncle, they were able to prepare them quickly and within a few minutes. If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh PA, it ain't a real trip there until you stop by Peppi's",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Tuesday afternoon with my father for lunch.  I had been to Peppi's before but it was many years previous and at their North Side location.  This location has a counter where you order off to the left as soon as you walk in.  The rest of the restaurant is composed of a number of different tables and booths, lots of wood and earthy colors and has some decorations consisting of Pittsburgh sports and Peppi's regulars.  Both my father and I decided to get a regular Italian hoagie on this day and they were brought to our table within 10 minutes of us ordering.  The sandwich itself looked pretty good and consisted of genoa salami, rosa salami, capacola and provolone cheese all on a nice bun that was just short of a foot.  I also decided to go with the lettuce, onion and dressing that was offered to me but said no to the tomato. Overall I thought that the taste of my sub was pretty good although I wouldn't have guessed that there was two kinds of salami and some capicola in it.  The bread may have been my favorite part of the sandwich as it seemed to be rather fresh.  I could also see some people complaining about the bread to filling ratio here as there seemed to be a lot more bread than filling but personally I was ok with it.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  The price was right and my sub was decent so why wouldn't I?",

I went with the regular Steak and cheese hoagie- grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo...add some hot sauce at the table, order of fresh cut fries and a drink. I get a work discount of 10% so anywhere you can eat lunch under $8 is awesome in any city.  My only complaint is that occasionally the meat to bread ratio isn't too great. Don't get me wrong I'm not expecting 12 ounces of meat but it can be disappointing. I recommend one of the more creative sandwiches then. Though the breads here are so fresh and enjoyable.",

    "text": "For years I had longed to take on the RoethlisBurger, but Peppi's hours aren't the most convenient for me. That is until a Saturday evening at Altar Bar with Icarus Witch and Kamelot caused Kay and I to track down dinner in the Strip District.   And there it was, Peppi's. And they were...open?  \"Yeah, 'til 8PM,\" a guy behind the counter said.   \"But the sign says...\"  \"Oh, ignore that. What'll it be, man?\"   Kay was frightened of the RoethlisBurger, so when I ordered it, she ran to The Clown across the street.   After the fellow took my order, I was given a ticket, and was told to sit down and relax. As I waited, I took in the surroundings, gazing at the sports memorabilia and photos of patrons both ordinary and famous.   Just as hunger pangs assailed my belly, there it was, enveloped in a paper plate in front of me: A homonculous of loose meat a la Maid-Rite gone malevolent. Ground beef, hot sausage, onions, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, scrambled eggs, and 'Merican cheese were all packed into a bread that was as flaxen as a Valkyrie and as airy as the morning mist. Upon doing some research I've found that it is called a Portuguese Roll, and it is pulchritudinous.   This behemoth of a breakfast sandwich dazzled my tongue with its spice, filled my stomach amply with its bulky, chunky  proteins, and soothed me with its fresh, fundamental vegetables, all of it held together with that amazing roll of rolls that threatens to make Italian bread passe via its sublime texture alone.   'Tis the greatest sloppy joe to ever emerge from a steaming flattop.   P.S. I found nothing \"shabby\" or \"greasy\" or \"dirty\" or \"loud\" about Peppi's. The service was friendly, the restaurant itself was clean, the atmosphere was quiet, and the sandwich was triumphant. If Primanti Brothers has a True parallel, it is Peppi's.",

Take a ticket to your table and the runner brings your food out and calls your number. I got the New Yorker (steak, provolone, american, onions, bacon) and did not add lettuce, tomato or mayo and it was amazing. Perfectly melted and delicious.

I'm surprised that no one has compared Peppi's and Uncle Sam's because they are practically identical, minus Uncle Sam's throwing in free fries if you eat in.  I ordered a cheesesteak ($7.22 w tax), after all of the cashiers agreed that it was one of the best sandwiches on the menu.  As promised, it was a delicious sandwich.  The bread was nice and fresh and the steak was good.  Additionally, the people working there were very friendly as well.  The portion was huge, and I got a meal and a snack out of my sub.

Their fries were very good as well, plenty of crisp and flavor. They could use a bit more salt though, I almost never salt anything at the restaurant and these guys needed a little bit of love.",

    "text": "As primanti's is to many Pittsburghers, Peppi's is to my boyfriend. He adores this place. We usually go to the one on the North Side (their back yard area is adorable!) but they were closed on the particular day we were planning to make a visit, which led us to the Strip. The seating is limited, so on a busy day, you may not be able to get a table. My mom, dad, boyfriend and I were able to find a table easily when we visited. My mom and I decided to split the Joey Porter \"Bella\" hoagie (steak, portabella mushrooms, swiss cheese and horseradish sauce) and added fried onions, lettuce and tomato to our hoagie. We also ordered onion rings and French fries as well. My dad ordered the Italian hoagie and my boyfriend ordered the New Yorker, which is his favorite.  My mom and I really enjoyed our hoagie, although we did find there to be a lot of bread on the sandwich. The bread was fresh and delicious, but made the sandwich extremely filling. The horseradish sauce on the sandwich was delicious and not very spicy. The onion rings were fresh and yummy and the fries were fresh cut! My mom and dad were first timers and really enjoyed their food.   One important thing to mention- the service was amazing. The man who took the orders was very patient with my family, while we tried to figure out what we wanted. He gave us helpful suggestions and was overall very friendly. At the end of our meal, he thanked us for stopping in, which was really nice.  Overall, I am not as obsessed with Peppi's as my boyfriend is, but I definitely enjoy their food. I don't think I will ever crave it like he does, but I don't think I could ever turn it down either!",

We were walking through the Strip and hopped in here because all the brunch places were packed.  The location is small on the inside, but I've never had trouble getting a seat. Their menu is large and the employees are always very friendly. My husband always gets the Rothelsburger and I rotate between their few vegetarian sandwiches. And we always get the cheese fries.  The food is consistently great, and this past weekend was no exception. Sometimes it takes a while to get your food - this past weekend they were short staffed, and it took a long time. However, they apologized and were very friendly about it.  I do wish they had some better vegetarian options. I feel like their veggie sandwiches are really close to being great, but kind of miss the mark - there's just some sort of flavor lacking. I can't quite put my finger on it. But the cheese fries always hit the mark for me!  Overall, love Peppi's and will continue to come back.",

Somehow thats like telling people you didn't like the Godfather.  I do not like Primanti's, and Peppi's is my favorite \"Pittsburgh\" sandwich.  I've Peppi'd on the North Side, Dahntahn, and in the Strip District.  They're all good.  I get the Italian, and I love the dressing they put on the sandwich.  Now I want Peppi's and its only 9:30 in the morning.  Damn.  Just go eat at Peppi's.  You'll realize this review is just pure truth.  It's delicious, and greasy, and good.",

Just over an hour and a half for the total visit. Service here was extremely slow.  The sandwich was pretty huge. I didn't feel the sandwich was worth the wait. Fries were great, but needed salt. Due to a lack of time in my schedule today, I filled up on the french fries waiting for the sandwich and was only able to finish a quarter of the sandwich and throwing the rest out.

We often take one day of a weekend when we are at home and bike downtown to enjoy the nice weather and to have lunch or a snack somewhere we normally would not drive to.  This small sandwich shop is exactly what I would picture in The Strip District - simplistic with Pittsburgh memorabilia and logos hanging all over the walls. There was also a wall covered with framed photos of guests who took their picture while dining at Peppi's.  The counter to order and observe employees making the sandwiches was located to the left as soon as we walked inside the door. We were able to see everything - form the frying of the fries and toasting of the bread to the frying of the meats and assembly of the sandwiches. Above the counter was a list of all of the sandwiches you could order. They ranged from Italian styled subs and burgers/sausage subs to steak and chicken subs. Their menu also listed several ways to serve a side of french fries such as regular or cajun with other options such as onion rings and a side salad. Our coupon was only good for the regular Italian sub which included two types of salami, capicola, and provolone cheese in addition to a fountain beverage. We ordered a side of fresh cut fries as well. While I love a good Italian sub, this one was a bit on the greasy side for me. The meat was \"fried\" which was fine but the outside of the sub was also pretty greasy. The bread outweighed the amount of contents inside of it - I was wishing for more meat and lettuce with less grease! The fries were not seasoned but there were salt/pepper shakers and ketchup/hot sauce located on the table to doctor them up. They were crispy and fresh which I enjoyed. Overall, this meal was decent and if we ever had another coupon or my husband wanted to go here again, I would not say no.   The employees were very nice. We were greeted as soon as we walked in by the gentleman who was frying the subs and our order was quickly taken by another employee. They were both very polite, helpful, and eager to serve us. We did receive our food in a timely manner, with fries arriving first and the sandwiches shortly afterwards.  Being a very casual, \"yinzer\" place, I was not surprised when I could see straight back into their storage area. The employees were carrying sub ingredients and tubs of items from the back of the restaurant, through the guests tables to the front counter. The restroom was also located in the back and I was very disappointed when I walked in and the whole room smelled of urine. Thankfully it was a quick stop for me.   Overall, this place is solid for a nice, greasy sandwich and fresh cut fries. Do not expect anything fancy but our experience was enjoyable to the point we may be back in the future!",

The fries came first and they were just alright. They desperately needed salt. The sandwich came out next and it was just okay.

However, it took 41 minutes from order time until our two sandwiches came out, and it was just not that busy.  The service was otherwise very good - friendly crew, easy going and helpful, etc.  But the fries came out in 10 minutes, and it took 31 more to get two, standard sandwiches.  That's just a bit broken.  FOOD:  Excellent.  I got the No. 7 (a.k.a., \"the Roethlisberger\"), and it did not disappoint.  The bread is a standout - so fresh, so soft.  The meats were great - a mix of ground beef and spicy sausage, served piping hot and just delicious.  I was unsure about the egg part, but it worked - it's not really a fried egg - more like scrambled on the flattop, and spread out flat, so it forms another layer.  My lovely wife got a Pepper Steak, add mushrooms.  She rated it highly as well.  One note:  the cheesesteaks can come with lettuce and tomato if you're into that, versus without, as is more traditional for a cheesesteak.  I will try again, but the 40+ minute wait (I really timed it, yes) could be a deal-killer.  Let's hope it was a one-off.  If so, I'll be glad to update my review.",

The staff at the counter were super nice and very helpful with two extremely picky and hangry young boys.  They accommodated our order and we're super friendly to the boys.  They were kind enough to make a plain cheese steak and call it a roast beef sandwich.  I ordered the Joey Porter-bello.  And WOW!!  They devoured the entire sandwich and said they loved the \"special bread.\"  I also devoured my JP...a cheese steak with portobello mushrooms and the most tasty horseradish sauce!  I could probably do shots of the sauce!  What the place lacks in ambience, it sure makes up for in great service and fast, fresh, quality ingredients!  That special bread is divine!",

They do have good sandwiches and cheese sauce but sadly it was not worth the forty minutes waiting for food. When we got the chicken tenders, they were lukewarm. The BigWheeler was good and plenty of food at least.",

So I walked into Peppi's to sit for lunch, honestly the place looked a little run down so I wasn't sure what to expect. I ordered a steak and cheese sub, with fries. The fries came out quickly, but were pretty soggy. Luckily, I was very happy with the sandwich. The bread the sub came on was good quality with quality ingredients. I also liked that the sandwich was not so overly stuffed, so it was easier to eat. I would go here for a sandwich again, but maybe just leave it at sandwiches.",

I did find a school to play ball at right outside of Pittsburgh but I couldn't find/ figure out what restaurant had the sandwich called \"The Roethlisburger\" -- I went all through college wishing I could had found this place. After college I would come back and visit and think \"man I wish I could find one of those sandwiches again\"... well, 11 years later/ today I FOUND IT!!!  11 years was worth the wait!!!  It was as savory and mouth watering as the first time I had this amazing sandwich. Hands down best sandwich in Pittsburgh. Hands down best sandwich I've ever had in my life. 10/10 - 100/100.",

    "text": "A great place to grab a sandwich if you're in the strip district for the day. This place is a classic just like Primanti Brothers.   Fast quick and easy the workers are welcoming and kind.   I stoped in on a Sunday to get a sandwich with my girlfriend. We both got the Italian and it was great. The Italian dressing is made with balsamic vinegar which makes it a little different and unique. The bread is soft and fresh. I added mayonnaise to my sandwich and it gave it a great little addition of creamy to pair with the acid of the vinegar.   I personally prefer the original location in North Side. Although the strip district location accepts credit cards!  If you've not tried Peppi's sandwiches you've not had a True Pittsburgh experience. Their menu has something for everyone and you will not leave disappointed.",

Peppi's has been the go-to for several reasons and we never leave disappointed.  As you walk in, there is a long counter that the chefs are behind. Then, walk down to the register and place your order. The chefs and workers have all been exceptionally kind, especially D. Each time I have visited Peppi's, D has made my visit and my guests visits both happy and memorable.   On top of the great service, the food is also delicious. My obsession with Italian hoagies can be temporarily satisfied with joy here. They serve the burgers on footlong sub rolls and my brothers think it's the coolest thing. If you are a vegetarian, they have options for you, too! Their cheese fries are amazing. Also, prices are pretty fair here. You can get away with a good meal for around $10, which is to be expected if you're getting a large sandwich and a pile of fries bigger than the Great Pyramid of Giza.  When you're done eating, you'll be heckled a little for not finishing your food, but a worker will wrap it up for you with a smile. Without a doubt we'll be visiting Peppi's again soon!",

The next time you go in be weary of a older lady at the register couldn't be more upset that you walked in and interrupted her picking fries out of the warmer.  The food is pretty good if you are looking for a greasy cheese steak and fries type of meal.   Again just don't go here and expect to be said hello or thank you to.   The regular cheesesteak and Cajun fries are pretty good.",

For my money there's no sub spot in Pittsburgh I'd rather go. I find myself coming to this location a lot as the Strip District is convenient. That being said, I have several gripes about this location as opposed to the North Side one I also frequent.  (Redacted)  That being said, the food is still delicious. The location is just as \"rustic\" as all of the other spots. But if you want a more pleasant experience I'd recommend the North Side location.",

This is a yummy divey kinda place where you order at the counter, and your food is brought to you. The bread is great, and the quality of the meats is good as well.  The decor is really what kept me smiling here. Lots of vintage sports items, photos, and a ton of old Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head dolls! My family was entertained. They also play a great mix of old (Ray Charles) and new-ish (Green Day) music and it all flows together so nicely. We had family members ranging from ages 20-60 and everyone found themselves bobbing and singing along at some point. This was an enjoyable place, and if I'm on the strip again, I'm definitely stopping in!",
