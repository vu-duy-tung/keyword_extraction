    "text": "We were excited to try this restaurant for the first time so on one of the coldest days in January, we called to order takeout at 7:00 PM. They said they couldn't take the order over the phone and to come in to place the order. Strange, but ok....  so we bundle up and head Downtown. We arrive at 7:38 and the staff looks up from their cleaning only to say they close at 8 and are all cleaned up. I said we called not long ago and were told to come down and they are open for 20 minutes yet. Silence. I asked why they didn't tell us on the phone they couldn't serve us. Silence. No apology. Nothing. They refused to serve us. I tried to contact the management online through the website but zero response. No matter what the food is like, their behavior and lack of any apology is inexcusable, and the management clearly could care less. Will never return and will make sure I share this outrageous experience with others.",

They have Gluten Free crust available for a dollar more, but that is the only upcharge on the menu. The flatbread that I created was delicious and would have easily been a $15 menu item at other restaurants. Not only is it cheap (relatively), it's really good and fairly quick. I went in at a weird time between lunch and dinner, so I was in and out, but I imagine the wait time could be a bit longer during peak lunch or dinner hours. They also have $8 pre-created options that seem pretty good too, if you're not feeling the \"choose your own adventure\" style. I will definitely be going back!",

Three crust choices (including gluten free), 5 sauces (I loved the pesto) and a ton of fun and organic toppings.  They toast it up and once it's done, you can put more toppings on - cold cheeses, arugula, etc - and finishing oils and spices.  My pie - traditional crust, pesto sauce, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, fresh mozzarella, feta, roasted garlic, onion, and mushrooms was finished with balsamic and arugula - was everything I was looking for and more!  All for 8 bucks, too!  You don't have any limit for the toppings, but if you don't want to think - they have pre-designed pies as well which sound awesome.  Plus, two salads, a liege waffle with nutella for dessert and a case full of awesome bottled drinks.",

Its literally $8 for whatever you want. you could get every single topping they have and still pay $8.

Boy we were impressed! Think Chipotle but for pizza. You walk in and a friendly staff greets you. They walk you through the process of picking out a dough, sauce and all the toppings. They bake it fresh and ten minutes later you have a delicious cheesy goodness flat bread pizza on your table. Even without the coupon my husband and I would come back because of the happy friendly cheery staff and the fresh delicious pizza!

I pulled up Yelp and found this place very close by so I decided to give it a try. I am giving them 5 stars because the staff was super friendly and the pizza was extra tasty. The big bonus for me is they took extra precautions to ensure that there was no cross contamination of gluten. Most low cost establishments don't really get it and I have trouble with cross contamination. Most places will give you a gluten free crust but they usually don't understand the rest of the challenges even when you say it is an allergy. Not this place. They switched their gloves, used different baking dishes, different cutters, they took every precaution. It was very refreshing and I was able to eat a tasty gluten free meal without getting sick.  Bravo!",

This is a new 'line' of stores that Vocelli's is testing out, from what I hear on the local pizza blog.  V3 is essentially a pizza form of Chipotle, but better.    You start on one end of the counter and choose your crust.  Traditional, Multigrain, Gluten-Free ($1 more).  The fresh doughball is then put through a machine to be pressed out into a rectangle and pressed onto the pan.  Then you choose your sauce and all your toppings.  You can choose one that they have already put together as well. It goes into the conveyor oven.  While it cooks, you pay for it.  It comes out on the other side and goes to the finishing station where you can add some olive oils, fresh basil, more cheese, etc.  Box it up and take it to-go, or eat inside the 2 level spacious area.  For $8 per pizza, you can't beat it.  You can get several toppings too; I'm talking 5-6 toppings and its still $8.  You best be gettin' to this place before there is a line out the door!  New favorite lunch calorie splurge.  Because this is a \"make your own\" place, there is no website or ordering over the phone.",

I actually had to put my face up to the glass to see if there was anything going on inside and when I looked in I was surprised to see a line of people ordering pizzas! You need to make that window wall lighter so people can see in or some type of sign that indicates you are a pizza shop. The V3 branding looks nothing like what you are...a food establishment. I thought V3 was a wine shop or spa or something. Maybe revisit some of your branding. Also, put your hashtag on the menu or on a sign somewhere so people can continue to talk about it! I couldn't find it! Please work on the marketing efforts so you don't have to close! It's delicious and the service is great!",

Just note that although the line gets really long really quickly, it also goes fairly fast because it's a Subway-like assembly process.  I'm only taking down a star because I would have liked more of the fresh ingredient topping that was the finisher on mine (basil), but I also see that it makes good business sense to keep the amount of toppings on the light side, especially since they are not yet charging a la carte for those, and they need to be able to assemble, cook, and deliver very quickly.

I've been here three times now so I think it's safe to write a review as my experience has been similar each time.  The first people you encounter are great!  Every visit the initial order taker has been friendly and energetic. My first visit, she nicely explained how it works and all the various options. You pick your crust, sauce, and toppings then you go to the cashier to pay. This is where it starts to go downhill.    Each visit, the cashier has been distracted, once she was actually on her phone. Every visit, the cashier has not been friendly, just asking if I wanted to add a brownie and drink and then giving me my total.  No greeting, no thank you, no have a nice day.  Just here's your change.   The next step is to wait for your pizza to cook and then add any finishing touches you want. The first visit, the person working this area was not clear about which pizza he was working on and I almost got someone else's.  The second and third visits he was even more unfocused than the cashier. One visit I had to tell him three times that I wanted asiago cheese before he zoned in and started to move.  It's not like I had a list of things he was having trouble remembering.  It was just that one thing.   Food A++. Staff 1/3 fantastic, 2/3 apathetic. Perk up your cashiers and get a new closer and this could be a five star place.",

I went with the whole grain crust and did a variety of toppings based on other reviewers mentiong they are a little skimpy on their portion sizes of toppings (so ask for more or many!).    I really enjoyed the thin crust and overall the pizza hit the spot since it was custom made by and for me.

You get to choose from 3 types of crusts, white, wheat, or gluten free, you get to choose from 1 of about 10 sauces, then top it however you see fit with any number of their fresh toppings. They pop it in the oven, then about 3-5 minutes later you are out the door with your freshly made personal pizza. All in all you are in and out in about 10 minutes.   The thing that I appreciate is that they not only offer a gluten free option, but it's good. My girlfriend is GF, and she ranks this as the best gluten free pizza she's had. We can get 2 pizzas, loaded with toppings, one GF and one regular, for about $18 which. Gluten Free pizzas are usually very pricey, and I'm not a huge fan of them, so V3 offers an options that we can both enjoy.",

We couldn't find a menu or phone number online so we walked over. Closed. Despite the hours on the website saying they were open. Would have been helpful if we could have called to check.   The next day, still craving pizza I walked over myself and decided to try again. It was open! Despite a rocky start, I loved it! It was like a subway for pizza and done in minutes! I love all the organic portions, plus gluten free dough available! I'll have to take my family who is gluten free there to try it out. I had the traditional dough with red sauce, fresh mozzarella, pecorino Romano, reissued garlic, organic mushrooms and Italian sausage. Then to finish after it was cooked I had them add a drizzle of olive oil, shaved Parmesan and fresh organic arugula.   It was incredible! I loved the size for the price and how quick it took to make. I will definitively go back! I also really like that it is a locally owned business. And the decor was really chic! It's a nice addition to the downtown restaurant scene and very convenient (when open) for downtown workers.",

While waiting for food to cook, one server begin eating her own food from the fridge, leaving her food container open on the counter top in between taking orders.   In addition, servers were short tempered and the loud music and sounds of them throwing boxes while cleaning made it impossible to order without yelling.",

    "text": "I've recently gone gluten free and I was glad to see that this place had gluten--free crust available. I tried it and didn't notice any difference in taste or feeling, which was nice. However, the customer in front of me in line got a regular crust and traditional red sauce. I saw them use the sauce ladle to spread the sauce on her crust and put it back into the sauce, then use the same ladle to spread the sauce on my gluten-free crust. This raises some cross-contamination issues - not a problem for me, but definitely dangerous for people with more serious health-related gluten-free diets.  But I do really like this place! They have so many options for sauce, cheese, and toppings! Pizzas are a flat rate, which allows you to put as many toppings as you want without worrying about crazy upcharges. They are a good size, I have ended up taking about 1/3 of my pizza home because it was too much, but I've also eaten the whole thing myself. My boyfriend and I have very different tastes, so we like that we can each get our own pizzas and make them exactly how we want them.  There is upstairs seating available, which I like because it is away from the counter. However, the lights were turned low - seemingly for an \"atmosphere\" reason. Maybe it's just me, but I like to be able to see my food when I eat, and it feels a little dark up there.   Excited to see that they now have a Lawrenceville location too, much easier than driving downtown for me!",

V3 is located on what I think is a quieter street in Downtown. As other reviewers have said, the toppings are sparse however the finished pizza is well constructed and this can be counterbalanced by asking for more toppings. And you can have more than one sauce on your pizza - I asked for two cause I couldn't decide! The price is reasonable and the outcome is delicious - I will be back.",

    "text": "There's something about being the master of my own food destiny that is appealing to me. Build-your-own burrito places, sandwich shops, froyo shops....I love them all. And now there is a build-your-own pizza place! V3 operates exactly like Chipotle or Subway....you choose your own crust, sauce, and toppings, they run it through the oven, and voila....customized pizza! After it's cooked, you can even doctor it up with \"finishers\" (cheeses, oils, etc.) to add the final piece de resistance to your creation. The pizza crusts they use are flatbread crusts, so it's very thin and crispy. It's quite large (8 slices), but because it's so thin, one person with a normal appetite should be able to finish a pizza themselves.   The pizzas are a flat $8 price, regardless of how many toppings you choose. They also have pre-made selections that you can order if you don't feel like making your own. During my visit, I opted to make my own with a multigrain crust, pesto sauce, mozzarella cheese, spinach, roasted garlic, and chicken. For the price, I thought the pizza was quite tasty, although they were fairly stingy with the toppings. Unlike Chipotle, where they will heap the meat and beans onto your burrito with reckless abandon, here they carefully measure every topping so you get a set amount. I'm sure they do this as a cost-savings measure....and it probably doesn't make a difference in the pizza taste if you get a ton of toppings, but if you only get a few like I did, it can make the pizza seem a little sparse and sad. I guess next time I'll go toppings wild!  I came here during dinner time, and the process moved quickly because there were only a few other people there. I wonder how fast the line moves during lunchtime rushes though? Regardless, it's a cool concept and I'm sure I'll be back to Frankenstein up another pizza soon!",

By no means am I saying that all V3 employees have displayed such disrespectful service towards patrons; however, it's takes one person to ruin it for all the others. During a recent visit I was shocked when an employee muttered something under her breath in response to a customer's request. It was said with such an attitude that it was rather off-putting. Needless to say, it spoiled my visit to V3 and made my pizza less enjoyable.   I would rather draw attention to this occurrence as opposed to idly sitting by and letting that kind of service continue. So, I suggest that management train their employees on how be personable and respectful to customers. After all, the V3 experience is heavily dependent on customer and employee interactions.",

When you walk into V3 you have the option to pick one of their creations or build your own pizza. If you choose build your own you pick the following for your pizza: dough, sauce, toppings, and meats and the pizza goes through a small oven for about 3 minutes. Once it's finished you are asked if you would like to top it with anything such as cheese, pepper flakes, flavored olive oils, etc. And best part is, all pizzas are only $8!  As for the pizza themselves, I really enjoy them. I like a thinner crust because when pizza crust gets too think you feel like you are only filling up on dough. So far I have tried their Tuscan garden and firehouse chicken (buffalo chicken) pizzas and I love both. I personally love them too much to create my own but I have had friends create their own and they love it.   If you work downtown and you haven't been here yet you need to give it a try ASAP!",

    "text": "Easy concept: its the Chipotle of flatbread pizzas. You pick your crust, sauce and toppings: whatever you want for one low price of $8. They also have pre-determined selections if you're not feeling creative or you're overwhelmed by the number of toppings they have.   Came here for a late lunch and there was only one person ahead of me. I opted for a make-your-own and got multi-grain crust, traditional red sauce, and some usual toppings that I won't go on to list. It appeared to me that you could get as many toppings as you'd like because no where does the menu mention any limitations. However, when you ask for a topping, they don't really put on that much. So I recommend that you get a lot of toppings to get your money's worth unless there is hidden fine print on limitations somewhere that I didn't see. After you order your toppings, they put it in one of those pizza conveyor belt ovens and in a few minutes, it's nice and toasted for you. It comes out in a long rectangle with 8 slices. But wait, there's more! You get the option of topping it with their \"Finishes\" which are herb and spice-infused oils, extra cheeses or sauces. These oils and sauces are also placed on a counter by the door so if you'd rather put it on yourself, you have that option too.   Taste-wise, it was really good! The crust was thin and crunchy. The traditional red sauce was a little sweet, which I liked. My toppings were fresh, but like I mentioned earlier, not very generous. It did remind me of the taste of Vocelli's but with a much thinner crust. The pizza is probably best for one person and not shared since its more the size of a personal pizza.   Food was tasty and service was quick. I definitely see myself coming here for lunch when I'm in the mood for something fast and easy.",

Special thanks to Sam who hooked me up with her delicious recipe for Beer Cheeseburger pizza with the Romano cheese to finish! She and Candyce took care of us. Would absolutely come back especially when an evening theater event is just about the start :D",

    "text": "As someone who works downtown, we all know the issues of wanting to eat lunch or dinner at work.  Finding somewhere reasonably priced and quick can be a challenge. Market Square has helped with this, but when V3 popped up as an ROTD, I decided to test it out.  Taking the Qdoba approach, V3 allows you to get any pizza for $8.  The pizza is long, thin crust, and has about 8 small slices.  There were 8 sauces, a ton of toppings, and many \"finishers\" to choose from.  The interior is a warm modern vibe but may be trying a bit too hard to be trendy.  I ordered a tomato and green pepper pizza for my lunch. The toppings, unfortunately, were pretty low quality. The tomatoes were still green and the green peppers not too fresh.  The employees were very friendly except for a short girl with dark hair who was sulking around and screwing her coworkers over by not working.  Otherwise, this place was a fine place for lunch.",

    "text": "This delicious, wallet friendly, and highly customizable pizza/flatbread location will satisfy everyday eaters and gluten-free folks alike. Following Chipotle's assembly line business model, V3 provides a wholesome Za experience that minimizes the time it takes to get Pizza into your face-hole. NOTE: for Celiac's/Gluten-intolerant folks, cross contamination IS possible at this establishment so be cautious.  ZA REVIEW: To start, customers select their crust. I went with the gluten-free option (+$2) to accommodate my current dietary needs. Next, the sauce, of which they have many options. I went with their standard red. If you have spinach, it is applied before the cheese. Cheeses are diverse, I had both Wisconsin and fresh mutz. An even, unobtrusive amount of cheese is distributed, but customers can ask for more or less to taste. The plethora of toppings to be added before entering the oven were numerous, and customers can chose as many as they wantswithout any up charge. I tip my hat to that, V3. I went with spinach, green peppers, kalamata olives, sun-dried tomato, and grilled chicken. When removed from the oven, V3 offers \"finishers\" to be added to your flatbread/pizza. I added red pepper oil and fresh basil. Magnifico. My pizza was gorgeous. Perfect leopard spotting on the cheese, but an under-defined coastline (sauce separating cheese from crust). I could have done with a larger corniccione (crust), as I got sauce all over my hands and had to kill about 87 trees with all the napkins I used. The sauce was sweet, and complimented the tanginess of the sun-dried and kalamata olives tomatoes handsomely. The pizza was delicious. Even with added oil, no soggification of the crust occurred. SCC (sauce-cheese-crust) ratio was satisfactory, and this pizza was filling without being too heavy. I give V3 Flatbread/Pizza Za 7.5/10 pepperonis.  SERVICE REVIEW: People working the assembly line were kind, and did their jobs well. I noted that the pineapples were not fresh, and they were out of arugula as a finisher, which was a slight but not deal breaking turnoff. While the restaurant provides gluten-free options, as mentioned before, cross contamination can occur, so those with higher sensitivities may not want to eat here. This is disappointing. Additionally, the bathrooms required a code to be used, and we already threw out our receipt, so we had to find a toilet elsewhere.  BOTTOM LINE: V3 is an affordable, quick, and tasty pizza/flatbread option in Downtown Pittsburgh. Gluten-free options are available, but cross-contamination may deter those with harsher sensitivities. V3 gives customers the option to make a \"lighter\" flatbread, or a \"heavier\" pizza. The options for customization in this experience feel virtually limitless. V3 gets four stars for its well done Za and high customization but clear areas for improvement.",

There was not much flavor because they barely put any veggies on the pizza. I'm used to large chunks or artichokes, but here they separate each individual slice and place it on the pizza.  Too many other good restaurants in town for me to hurry back here anytime soon.",

You can order from 3 crusts and 5 sauces, lots of toppings and after it is cooked they put an oil at the end if you would like.  You can pick what you want and there are about 8 pizzas on the menu.  I ordered the Sunny Side Sausage and had sun fried tomato added.  All for $8.  Not bad.  The pizza was good but the dough was a little dry and not any flavor.  There are two salads on the menu.  The place is small with a few tables but the line was beside the few tables, more of a take out place.   I would think that this will be popular for lunch in a busy downtown.",

You'll get a high-quality individual, made-to-order pizza that will not disappoint. I've been here a handful of times and the service has always been just as good as the food!  It can get a little crowded around lunch time, but they do a great job of keeping the line moving as quickly as it possibly could when you are having something made to order. Luckily there are additional tables upstairs because the 1st floor gets a little crazy around peak times. You pick your dough, your sauce, your toppings, and your cheese and they have a great variety of options. They also have a menu you can choose from if they options are overwhelming to you. I'm confident that this place could satisfy the pickiest eater up through the most adventurous eater! You can go as wild or as tame as you want.  This is a great option for people with specialized diets too, with no-cheese Vegan  pizzas and Gluten-free dough as well!",

Clean, friendly environment, the staff workers were exceptionally happy when I told them it was my first time being there! I got the BBQ pit boss and man was I impressed! The flat bread pizza was delicious. I love that they offer so many different ingredients for the pizzas they offer, or you can get one of their signatures as I did.

Obviously the place fills up at lunch time, but there is ample seating upstairs for lunch groups and I've never had a hard time finding as seat. You start by choosing your dough, then a sauce, cheese, and toppings. You can choose additional toppings after your flatbread comes out of the oven (arugula, Himalayan salt, sun-dried tomatoes, etc).  V3 provides a menu of their house specialties and they are all very good. There are variations of your standard meatlover, pepperoni, buffalo and bbq chicken pizzas. They have also started compiling a menu on the back wall of their favorite pizzas they have seen people create.   V3 is a nice option because they don't limit or charge excess per topping so you have the liberty of truly creating a pizza in your image. An option that is not listed on the menu but my own specialty is: white dough, white garlic sauce, buffalo mozzarella, sausage, artichokes, red onion, kalamta olives, sun dried tomato, and shredded basil.",

It takes a lot to have a successful GF pizza, but I definitely think they pull it off.   I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was delicious. The toppings were great, there was a fair amount of chicken (which is my biggest complaint when getting a protein on your pizza) and the BBQ sauce was nice and tangy. The best part? The GF flatbread was crispy. Not soggy like some GF breads can get.   Want to know the super special bonus. They have a variety of ranch dipping sauces. My days of dipping pizza in ranch span back to high school, where you had to mask the cardboard pizza flavor. This ranch just compliments it! They even have a handful of varieties, including a buffalo ranch, which is zesty and perfect for pairing with any pizza in my opinion.   Glad they have two locations downtown and in Lawrenceville. Looking forward to more, South Hills maybe? Can't wait to come back! This review is making me hungry for their pizza right now!",

They have different types of dough available, various types of pizza sauces, a handful of cheeses, and more than a dozen toppings. After you pick everything, the pizza goes in an oven for a minute or so and then you can add various types of finishes.   I created my own pizza with traditional dough and sauce, and then added salami, pepperoni and sausage with mushrooms, onions and olives. To top it off I added balsamic glaze and sun-dried tomatoes.   The pizza was very good, and the perfect portion for one person. Would definitely come here again for a bite to eat!",

The sauce is under seasoned and when you're eating a cheese less pizza you need all the flavor you can get it. I do enjoy drizzling the flavored oil and balsamic reduction on my vegan pizza.   For a vegan pizza bite in Downtown this place ain't bad.",

If you want to promote you pizza restaurant as having unlimited toppings it is unacceptable to be stingy with your toppings. It was a disappointment spending my Friday lunch at your establishment and I will not be returning. I hope this review saves others from wasting their precious time and money.",

I like that they offered a multigrain crust option, plenty of flavorful cheeses and veggie toppings. The flatbread is a really generous size but isn't too heavy for lunch.

    "text": "I went to V3 for a yelp elite event and was surprised at the great quality of ingredients for such a low price! Each personal pizza is $8 for unlimited toppings and they had a lot of choices! First they take a fresh portion of dough and stretch it to order. Next there are several options for sauce, cheese (including fresh mozzarella!) and veggies (a lot of organic options) then meat and it gets cooked in a conveyer style oven. Then you get to add finishing toppings. This includes various greens, more cheese, and specialty oils. I really recommend topping any greens you get with the oregano oil! So many times you get arugula on top of your pizza and with no additional flavors it kind of ruins the Pizza... but with one of the great flavored oils it's like having a real salad and a pizza. My only complaint is that the dough doesn't get super crisp due to the coveted belt style pizza oven and the trays they get cooked in. A more direct heat would crisp them up, but for $8 I couldn't complain! This would be a great lunch spot especially downtown where a lunch under $10 is nearly impossible outside of fast food.",

This is now one of my top choices for lunch during the weekdays. It's good, fast and relatively cheap. However, make sure that you come a bit earlier before noon since the lunch rush usually drives the long lines. You get to pick the dough, toppings for when it cooks and them condiments for after it comes out of the oven. There's also plenty of sitting upstairs. If you're in it for deals, there are specials which are super cheap!",

Even better - they're personalized and the perfect serving size for 1! The pizza, along with its wide array of ingredients, is incredibly fresh. They also have allergy friendly options which I was especially excited about. Being lactose intolerant, I'm often unable to eat pizza. As you can see below, I decked out my dish with plenty of mouthwatering toppings which would be a preferred substitute for cheese any day of the week!",
