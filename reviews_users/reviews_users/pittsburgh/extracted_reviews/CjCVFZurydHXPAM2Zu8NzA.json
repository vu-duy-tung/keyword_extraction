They were AWFUL!! They also told me I couldn't get a medium pan pizza. Their service was just terrible. They had no idea what they were doing.",

IDK) and were told that it would be 25 to 35 minutes for delivery. We waited a literal hour, called up, were told that the delivery driver was on his way... it's over a half hour later, still no pizza. I'm really frustrated (and hungry?) and irritated. We ordered at 1:29. At the time of this review it is 3:13. Really unacceptable. Won't be ordering again from this location.",

And they obviously deliver but you cannot order online for delivery which I do not understand. I wish I could give them no stars. Like other reviewers stated, they were bad and I thought after a year I would give them another chance. So really I guess this is my mistake. Will not order from here ever again. Horrible.",

Everything was fine until we opened the pizza. The smell of rancid pepperoni filled the air. We couldn't believe it. So I called the store to inform them that I didn't want a refund and that they may be serving rancid pepperoni. The person answered and became very ignorant and rude when I politely claimed there was a problem. After showing his ignorance and stating that the only reason for my complaint is because he's not American, I could see there was no point to proceed further. They burned me for 25.75 + 5.25 tip. I'm not one to complain if I have a serious complaint I just don't return. But this one I will be forwarding to corporate for further review. No franchisee should have people who work for them like these guys. Wazeen is the mgr and was supposedly not around when I called. No certified food safety mgr on duty!

This is the second time we've had issues with this store and after the time, we stopped ordering for a while but then after about 8 months decided to give them another try. What a mistake. WHAT. A. MISTAKE. they forgot our soda (which happened to be the root of the problem the last time as well), we were told they'd be back with it in an hour. Now, that right there is absurd to me... An hour?! I ordered the soda to go WITH my pizza.. I mean, really?? OK, so an hour comes an goes, we call back and are told that the delivery driver just came and got it and it on his way. A half hour later.. You guessed it, still no soda (we live a mile away, FYI). So we call yet again. The 'shift leader' answers and wants to know who told us he was on his way.. Well, as much as I like to make it a habit to learn all the names of the employees of surrounding businesses, we didn't know who this person was. So let's skip to the real reason for this review. Although there are LOTS of things I could write about and truthfully, probably should, what prompted me to write this review was that the lady on the other end of the phone dropped the F bomb at my husband. And not just once or twice, no no, about 6 times. Was he heated? Yes. I'm not saying he was a doll about the whole thing. But she started swearing and threatening to call the cops on him because he said he was going to just come get it himself. Seriously. Just never ever again. Never. Ever. All we wanted was a soda!",

I just want my freaking money back for your terrible service and incorrect product.  He wouldn't give me a refund so I had to block the charge through my credit card company.

(The two guys I work with and me) An hour came and went, and still no pizza. We called the store and were told that the driver was on his way. So, another hour came and went. (2 hours now since the order was placed) We called again and the lady informed us that the driver had been \"held up\" and robbed. Seriously...? I don't mean to sound crass, but I don't believe that for a second. At this point, we requested to have our money back only to then be yelled at and sworn at by the lady on the other end. She finally complied, but only after she threatened to call the police on us. (Sounds kind of familiar...) Now to today. I ordered my pizza at 11:48AM. (The store is 7 minutes from where we work FYI) 12:30 came, still no pizza, so we called. I was told the driver is on his way. 12:45...Nothing. 1:00...Nothing. I called again and was informed that he was going to call the driver to see what was going on. Around 1:10PM (Almost an hour and a half), the pizza showed up. The driver also had someone in the car with him and did not even come to the door. This place is clearly very improperly run and just all around horrific customer service. I would HIGHLY recommend that you do not place an order from here unless you plan on driving to get it yourself.",

When I called to make sure they would send mayo & Italian dressing with the sandwiches I was put on hold, transferred, and called back just for them to tell me they would charge for Italian dressing because it didn't come on the hoagie & the didn't have mayo. So much for that order. Cancelled. Don't order here. Shane because there's not much to eat in this area.",

    "text": "So this review is about Domino's customer service in genefal. I ordered a pizza from the foster ave domino's a little over a month ago . Now it isn't a huge deal but they forgot to put one of the toppings on the pizza. Hey, I paid for the 3rd topping so I wax a little annoyed.  Yes it was the workers at this dominos who forgot,  but I'll give them props that customer service was good when I came to get the pizza, the young lady at the front was friendly , gave me extra red peppers etc.. My bigger pet peeve goes out to dominos customer service I emailed about the issue and their reply was basically sorry stuff happens , we will reach out to the owner. I emailed again offering to show a copy of the receipt and perhaps some sort of reimbursement, I wasn't expecting full.monet back on the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpizza.no&s=21a6baa065ab5e590a591b33bfc5e5d80bcd8a1c1e6cccacbaa0e6795249cc5f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pizza.no</a> Rey ever. I tweeted them, no reply. I left a fb message for them, they relied they would look into it but they never emailed back. So I hate to say do the eat at this dominos , it seems u just. They made a silly mistake missing a topping. Some sort of response from corporate to a comsumer more than hey stuff happens would've been appreciated. These stars reflect my overall opinion on dominos.",

Then he just said there's nothing they can do it's on the way the driver must be stuck in traffic. (There's no traffic between me and the store). I'm appalled at how absolutely awful this place is. NEVER order from them please!! I wish I could give zero stars. Or talk to someone at the company who cares about customer service. I hope they go out of business soon. Now I see why no one orders Dominos!!!",

Then someone just mumbled something into the phone and wouldn't respond. So I called the second time, and that person was the rudest food service employee I've ever dealt with in my life. He said it would be 45 min to an hour. I said fine. Well over an hour later, I gave up and went to bed. My boyfriend stayed up to watch TV. Now it's 1:30, and we get 2 calls from some mystery number (it wasn't the store number) so we didn't answer. Then we hear a knock at the door. My boyfriend answers it, and it's the delivery person. He was rude too! He said \"I've been calling you\", handed my boyfriend the pizza, and just left. The pizza was luke warm. I should have read the reviews about this place before I ordered. Absolute WORST. We are taking our hard earned money to a restaurant where we are treated respectfully. What a shame.",

Upon further inspection we found out half of the dough wasn't under the cheese, just cardboard. Also the entire pizza wasn't fully cooked. I called and told them and they told me they would credit my account and hung up on me . Funny thing is I paid in cash you can't credit my account. I would go back and make them give me my money back but I stopped on the way to get baby food and get back to my pregnant wife it was a one way trip. Worst food I've ever ordered from a food chain.
