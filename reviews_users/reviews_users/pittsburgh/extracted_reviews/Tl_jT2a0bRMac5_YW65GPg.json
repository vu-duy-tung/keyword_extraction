One of the ordered appetizers never came out once we had ordered though. The wait time on the food was the major problem.  60 plus minutes  for food is tough to handle when the tables around you come  in later order wings and get them fairly quickly (15 to 20 min). Food was good but the wait was brutal.  I'll return again because  the atmosphere  and food quality  but if waits like this continue to happen I will look elsewhere.",

    "text": "My experience was great. I work at a bank and once a month I get a weekday off so I can work a Saturday. Today I was off and it happened to be a daytime Pittsburgh Pirate baseball game. After getting my oil changed, at about 3:00 I met up with a friend at our usual sporting event location, buffalo wild wings. We had two GREAT bartenders. I want to say I do not know these bartenders personally but they have waited on me several times. We bought beers and food throughout the game. Overall, we spent about $120 together. My fiancee came to join us when she got out of work at about 5:30 and another couple joined us after they were out of work at about 6:00. At about 7:30 we were getting ready to leave. I asked the bartender for one more beer and my check. She informed me that I was \"cut off\" because the manager stated that I had been there \"since noon\". I was nothing but friendly and respectful the entire time I was there and I had not entered BWW until after 2:30. The manager that cut me off was Bobby. He claimed his \"associate\" said I was there too long. The bartender was very upset because she claimed that she did not feel I was intoxicated or causing a problem. She was also upset that this was happening to me when management does not cut off people who are obviously belligerent and are requested by bartenders to be cut off and their request is ignored. I am upset as a loyal buffalo wild wings customer. I am a frequent customer because I enjoy wings, beer, and sports. I will not go back to this franchise. I was a perfectly well-behaved paying customer tonight. I purchased over $40 in food and was in no way causing a problem. I am upset at the way I was treated. On my days off I like to watch sports and have a few drinks. I do not feel I was causing any sort of problem. My fiancee was there and would not have tolerated any inappropriate behavior from me. I believe this manager was wrong and needs corrected so that he does not have the same affect on other customers that he had on me. I also feel sorry for the bartender that she lost a tip because she was wonderful and she not have put up with actual belligerent customers that management refuses to address. I hope this shines some light on some issues at this location. I will not return to this particular location but my hopes are that your franchise can correct the manager issues and help out some awesome bartenders that you have working there.I gave a 5 for experience because my service was great but I am unbelievably disappointed in my experience. I have never been cut off at a bar and would have never expected that to happen to me at such a casual event.",

I know to take a jacket because every time I eat inside it is freezing inside. However the service is typically pretty good and the food is decent. My complaint is about the take out service. It is horrible! I always sit and wait for my order for about an extra 10-15 minutes!! It is never ready by the time I arrive. Even if I order it an hour before. I also always ask for well done Wings and most of the time they aren't well done and are barely cooked when ordering takeout. Not pleased and probably won't be back for a while.",

The heckling stopped and he made sure he checked on us numerous times. Then we went to close our bill. He took money off of it. I didn't expect that or didn't even ask for that and that truly made me feel so appreciative. I think the managers name was Dave. He is a great manager!

First off, the service.  The service is amazing! Every person that works there is courteous, personable and fun to talk to.  Every server that we have had has exceeded our expectations on being great. They joke around with you, accommodate you in every way possible and make the experience worth while.  Next the food.  The food is always hot and comes out quickly. And the flavors of wings are great! I normally get \"hot bbq\" and it has just the right amount of spice with flavor. The fried pickles are delicious!  The beer battered onions wings are great as well, and the southwest ranch sauce is great for dipping in!    My only little quip, is that the wings are a little smaller than some other wing places, but I can look past that when they are tasty!  The big winner here are the people that make the experience a great one: The employees!",

I then proceeded to wait ANOTHER half an hour for boneless wings AS THEY WERE TRYING TO THROW IN THE SAME FRIES THEY BAGGED FOR ME NOW GOING ON AN HOUR AGO.

After the fries came out with the rest of the order there was still no celery or carrots to go with both orders after being on the menu as coming along with the food. I ask for them & the reply I received was a shitty \"oh you want those?\" Please, Stop me if I'm incorrect but don't they come with the order? It was only after my complaining (which I usually DO NOT do & have never has to do over WINGS & FRIES) did I get my full refund only to take the shitty food home with me.

Despite the convenience, I would rate this as the best restaurant in the chain. The staff is friendly, the food is dependably excellent, and the layout is both welcoming and comfortable. Please, \"b-dubs,\" take a look at what is going on at this restaurant and use it as an example of how other locations should be. Great job, and kudos to the staff for making this an excellent dining experience.  Pros: you get what you expect, but with lots of extras. It's buffalo wings, and a variety of sauces and sides. Other dishes include sandwiches and the like, if you're not in the mood for the flagship offerings. Equipment such as seating and counters, entertainment options, etc., are all in good clean shape.  Cons: There could be easier parking lot access.",

Employees sitting next to the bar were loud. Dirty tables everywhere. Clearly the management doesn't give two shits what the staff does or even if they keep their sections clean. Place is a let down. Just go to Applebee's for anything you'd go to bdubs for.",

My wife and I also enjoy the game options the provide while you eat.  But that is the only good of this place.  The food is so mediocre it is mind blowing.  If you have \"wings\" in your name, I expect you to have at least above average wings.  I can and have made better tasting wings in my oven than you get at BWW.  They are never crispy and I have never had a sauce that has impressed me.  On top of that, the ranch tastes like bottled ranch.  They are the same whether you go regular or boneless wings.  I won't go as far as to say they are bad.  If I have the choice between tysons frozen wings and BWW, i'll probably choose BWW.  However, the difference is not very substantial.  Other than the wings, their sandwiches and the rest of the food is also nothing more than average.  They do have good appetizers, and the potatoe wedges are delicious.  Stick to beers and apps unless you enjoy bad food.",

THE BAR AREA: The place was filled with jerseys and fans braving the workday to cheer on their home team. The staff was kind enough to put the Red Wings game on a side TV for us. Back home in TX it's hard enough getting one TV for hockey but this place was FILLED with hockey! Bless you PA. Bless you.  SERVICE: There is no \"I\" in this BWW'S \"team\"! Our waitress was prompt and attentive. Our food was brought out by many different team members so it was served as it came out the kitchen.   FOOD: The wings were saucy, the burger was delicious, and the buffalo chips were the cherry on top. We didn't make happy hour which was a bummer but the tall beers were a reasonable price.",

Not as many people here as I would expect on a Tuesday night. There was a regular crew at the bar, but I expected more out-of-towners being so close to a number of hotels. It was a little hard to get to, but that could just be Pittsburgh driving.",

No matter how good wings and beer are done, they are nothing without good service. I couldn't get a drink here to save my life. Took forever between time I got a menu and the time they took my order.   They served my dinner along side my appetizer at the same time. They also run the glass washer right next to the customers. It has the most foul sewer odor ever. Just what you want when eating. Even the bartender agreed with me about how it smelled. Disgusting. Never again for me.   Had to edit:  I left out that I never got napkins, silverware, ketchup or salt. I ended up fending for myself off of a table nearby when I got tired of waiting.",

We also had sides of fries and macaroni and cheese.  Food is decent -- reasonably priced, pretty salty, a little fatty, but good ol' sports bar food. I think the location has very little to do with that. The wings aren't very saucy so you might want to ask for extra sauce on the side, if you're into saucy wings.  Service was very good -- the server changed the TV to the World Series of poker for me, kept coming with drink refills and napkins and extra sauces without batting an eye. Was also seated and waited upon quickly.  Overall a good meal for the price. It could be better, but for the price, it's a good value.",
