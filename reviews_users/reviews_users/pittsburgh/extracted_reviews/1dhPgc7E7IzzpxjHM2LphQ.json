Get your late night Mexican cravings at Mad Mex. after 11 they have Big Azz Margariitas (they always feature a different special flavor each month) for $7... You can't beat the buzz. They also have everything (except a few items) for 1/2 price after 11, too. This isn't just a college kids dream, it's everyone's dream. Everything is creatively, flavor fully mastered, and your taste buds will thank you. So many vegan friendly options, too. The only issue is the space. It's like packing 50 people into your mom's kitchen. The margaritas help the awkwardness of your ass rubbing up against a complete stranger while your tatas knock a dish of waffle fries (jersey fries) to the floor. GET THEIR RANCH, ask for extra, pour it on everything--- it is the best ranch dressing ever. Mmmmmm. Cinco de Mayo/Taco Tuesday all day every day. Enjoy the weirdness. Embrace the madness.",

    "text": "Even though parking here sucks, this is my favorite Mad Mex location.  If not for lack of parking, I'd give it 5 stars.   I loved their Horny Toad Margarita, which unfortunately is no longer on the menu.  But if you get an old timer, they'll still make it for you.  The closest thing to the Horny Toad is the Ultimate.  If you like a wicked sour margarita, this is the one for you.  I'm not a fan of the big azz margaritas that are popular there, they're  just too sweet for me.  The red sangria rocks!!  There's always and awesome selection of drafts and bottled beers too.  I like this location because it's really small and really dark.  I know that's not a plus for lots of people, but I like it.   I love the Insane San Francisco Wings with Blue Cheese.  We always order them well done.  Insane is the highest on their heat scale, the heat level isn't consistent, but it's usually pretty hot.  The blue cheese is a perfect balance to the garlicy San Francisco sauce.   My husband almost always gets the Chicken Chimichanga, its generously stuffed with tasty chicken, it's always nice and crispy.   I love most of the quesadillas and fajitas... but I think my favorite entree is the Dance Marathon Enchiladas.  I love the garlicy portabello mushrooms and spicy spinach.  The tortilla soup is thick and creamy and so good.  The casa salad is awesome with the Lime Cilantro dressing.  A garlicy spicy creamy pesto-type dressing that is also great to add as a dipping sauce for quesadillas and taquitos.   The salad is a simple combination of leaf lettuce, cherry tomatoes, red onions, blue cheese crumbles, green pepitas... the crunchy pepitas with the salty, tangy blue cheese topped with lime cilantro dressing... YUM!!!!  One of my favorite places to eat.",

It's not the place to go for a quick good ol super burrito, but if you like Mexican food and at times wished that it was more \"sophisticated\", check this place out. The seating was kind of cozy, so I don't know if it would be ideal for a busy weekend night if you have a large party, but I'd definitely come back.",

    "text": "Oh, Mad Mex.  How I always want to like you, and always walk away going, \"Oh yeah, I remember that.\"  I lived two blocks down from Mad Mex for a good bit of college, so it was inevitable that we ended up here our fair share of times.  However, very rarely did our food-ordering go past chips and salsa, and each time I try to have food here, I realize why: I just don't like Tex-Mex or Cali-Mex or whatever sort of not-the-real-deal-Mexican food Mad Mex is.  That said, they do make a good margarita, and they do run a lot of specials.  The Oakland location has half-price menu items each evening after 11 (much, but not all of the menu qualifies for this), and two happy hours for cheap booze, including half-price Big Azz Margaritas (those are the 22-ouncers that often made for early bedtimes during college).  The drink happy hours and the food happy hours never coincide, but you can get your cheap drinks  from 4:30 - 6:30 (cheap wings at this point, too) or 9-11 each night, and if you stick around until after 11, you can get the half-price food menu.  Some times of the day are 21+, so you can have some margaritas and take advantage of the less-full restaurant before 11, then put in your food order once you've started drink round #2.  On our most recent visit, I tried to figure out what it is precisely that I don't like about their food, and I think it's the consistency of their tortillas.  They are a little doughy and thicker than what I'm used to.  Their fillings for quesadillas, burritos, and tacos just don't stick together like real Mexican food.  There are some things on the menu that truly are good, however.  Their waffle fries are seasoned quite well, and their chocolate dessert burrito is sinfully yummy.  At Thanksgiving time, the Gobbleritos (a burrito stuffed with all the fixins: turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, and corn) are quite good.  But past that, the food is only average.  The Oakland location, as many others have pointed out, gets quite crowded during peak times.  The service is chancey, and sometimes you get a great waitress, and sometimes one who could care less.  However, the musical selections playing throughout the restaurant are almost always awesome, so I've always liked that bit of the atmosphere.  One final point, the bathrooms are rather sketchy.  Back when I lived down the street, I always preferred to just walk to my apartment when needed.  The Mad Mex bathroom just doesn't seem clean.  And don't have so many margaritas that you forget if you should go in the door marked with a nut or a bolt ;)  Overall, if you're looking for a margarita and some chips, Mad Mex is okay.  But if you're craving Mexican food, this is not the place.  Although, after a Big Azz Margarita or two, you may very well not notice :)",

    "text": "With a Big Burrito gift card in tow (yay Christmas presents!), we headed over to Mad Mex on a Friday evening, around 6:30 pm.  Parking was pretty bad for Pittsburgh - we've never been to this part of Oakland before and it was just tiny, crowded streets, and students smoking on their porches while discussing drunken escapades.  Not the nicest neighborhood.  Inside, it was packed.  We anticipated a long wait, but actually were seated immediately - the noisy crowd wasn't there for dinner, just happy hour and cheap margaritas.  Apparently you get a table only if you are really eating a meal, which I have to say I appreciated.  The room was dark and noisy, but the noise level become much more manageable as happy hour ended and the drunk students left.  Much improved.  Our server informed us there were only a few minutes left of happy hour, so we managed to squeeze in a quick order of margaritas in order to get the discounted price.  $5 for their medium size (happy hour only) was a pretty good deal.  I had whatever their featured margarita was - frozen, with three different fruit flavors.  It was very tasty, gave me a light buzz, and didn't taste of mix.  Would've appreciated more than a \"light buzz,\" if you know what I mean, but for $5 it was a deal.  We ordered chips and salsa, which are unfortunately not free as they usually are at Mexican restaurants, but you did get a few fun salsa choices - we settled on roasted tomato chipotle.  I think it cost $3.  I liked the smoky chipotle flavor - but I still think it ought to be free.  It always seems greedy to me when restaurants charge for things that are traditionally free, like bread, or chips/salsa.    For my entree, I got one of the specials, which the server said was a great choice - the Jerk Pork and Fried Banana Tacos.  I have to admit, they were pretty tasty.  Pork was well-seasoned, bananas were delish (but I would've liked more of them!), but HOLY CRAP those tacos were hot.  And I love spicy food, truly spicy food.  But this - there were these whole slices of hot peppers.  I bit into one once, and couldn't taste anything for 10 minutes, it felt like my mouth was shaking.  Spicy tacos are one thing, but so hot that you can't even enjoy the meal?  I had to pick the peppers out, for my poor tongue's sake.  Rice and beans on the side were bland, which would have been annoying but ended up not bothering me given my temporary taco-mouth-death.  I know my boyfriend liked his chicken chimi, and I get the impression the food here is pretty good, and they do have some cool options.  But this location was so loud and collegey, I'm not sure I'd return.  I'd try a different location though, to seek better ambiance.  But you won't catch me paying for chips and salsa again - stingy ol' Mad Mex!",

Margaritas were too sweet, with too much triple sec, but I admit I'm a margarita snob. They were cheap ($5) and made with real lime juice, so still a thumbs up.

The beers are fairly fresh and continually bring rotated.  The atmosphere is nice too. The music is enjoyable and at an appropriate volume such that you can hear it and easily carry on a conversation. The restaurant is dimly light which is easy o. The eyes as the night caries on. The only thing I didn't like it that the decor obstructed the view of the television; however, Mad Mex is more of a place to catch up with friends than catch a game.",

    "text": "Let's start with the positives (of which there are few): the $7 margaritas were delectable. A True Mexican delight.  Sadly, it is here where the positives end. We (a party of 4) arrived hungrier than a group of overworked migrant workers and eager to satisfy our palettes with the heavily promoted Gobblerito. Little did we know, our evening would take a turn for the worse.  When we crossed the border into the dining establishment, we were given an estimate of 15-20 minutes until we would be seated. Let me tell you, when passing time with an irritable stoner who wants nothing more than to rest his weary legs, every minute feels like an eternity. After a half hour of standing with no food or drinks to show for our journey, our efforts began to feel fruitless. To keep morale up, the decision was made to order a round of margaritas before happy hour ended. What came next was the lone bright spot in an evening filled with disappointment and broken promises. The margaritas were an oasis of elation in a dessert of sadness. But the exuberance did not last long. Shortly after, we learned that a table had been vacant the entirety of our stay. However, the restaurant's laws stipulated that only a party of 5 could immigrate to the table. We. Were. Livid. No bueno.  Long story short, we waited for an hour to no avail. Don't go there.",

    "text": "I usually don't make my way down Atwood to Mad Mex, considering just how many yummy eateries are right up the street (Las Palmas! Bangal Kebab!). Luckily, Mad Mex has a tendency to offer up some pretty convincing deals every once in a while.  If you sign up for their birthday club, you get a coupon for a free burrito you can use around your birthday, and/or if you're a student, you get half off food Monday-Thursday from 2-4 PM. There are also many more deals listed on their website... seriously, saving money here requires only minimal planning.  I went with a friend around 2 PM for the student deal. We split some guac and chips, he got the fish tacos (not covered in the deal), and I got the thai curry burrito.  FOOD:  + I like the guac here better than at Steel Cactus, which I visited recently. You get salsa in addition to the guac, and the chips are also thicker and have some flavor on their own. Could be personal preference! + My burrito was delicious, and the sauce was creamy and tasty. + My friend enjoyed his fish tacos too, and I kind of ate them with my eyes.  SERVICE: our server was really nice, but she wasn't around our table that much. Small mistakes here and there, like I asked to get my burrito as a Bare-ito (like a bowl), but it came out with a normal wrap anyway. Also, the appetizer wasn't discounted like it should have been when our bill came, but she quickly corrected it once we let her know.  ATMOSPHERE: it wasn't a super busy time to go, so the place definitely wasn't as loud as some other reviews say. Still had a little bit of trouble talking over the music though. It seems like a good place for small meetups with friends.   Not dying to go back anytime soon, but I think it's still a decent option for this kind of food in the area! Three and a half stars for me. :)",

When the water-boil was in effect our waiter gave us attitude for asking if their water was contaminated.   Recently, after sitting, it took us at least 10 minutes to have our waiter come and take our order. It took even longer to get water. Once we were finished, he cleared our plates and didn't come back for another 15 minutes to ask if we needed our checks (we were just sitting there with no food and no water...)   Basically, every time I go the service is really sub-par. I'd be much more inclined to go more often if they had better waiters.",

Mad Mex is one of the few restaurants in the city that can make about 90% of whatever's on the menu and make it vegan or veg. And, if you have other dietary needs like lower fat options, they'll accommodate your needs. That's how we'll they take care of their guests. I love the angry hippy quesadilla, sauteed spicy spinach, mushrooms and vegan cheese stuffed in a whole wheat tortilla, grilled nice and crispy, served with the best guacamole in the city and a tasty vegan sour cream. Wash that down with one of many micro brews on tap and you'll be a happy mad mex fan.   By the way IPhone users, download the free Mad Mex app and you'll know exactly what's on tap at the nearest Mad Mex!",

The food is amazing. I always get the mad Mex burrito and no matter how hungry I am I can never finish it, good news though..it seriously tastes just as good the next day. Their jersey chips are out of this world..(get them with the ranch and wing sauce and thank me later!) not a big fan of their guac, there isn't enough flavor in it for me but forfeiting guac is a small price to pay for eating the rest of their food.   The service is kind of subpar all around. The servers are ALWAYS nice and friendly and fun but just seem to come to the table few times even when they're not that busy. My most recent server (Charla??) was great though, the best service I've had yet!   The atmosphere is not for everyone. The tables are pretty small and very close together, like you're dining with people you don't know. And the music is LOUD, when its a full restaurant it's to the point that I honestly just sit and eat because it's pretty impossible to have a conversation. Other than the noise level and the seating, it's a pretty awesome place, their style is not boring at all.   Bottom line: you need to eat here. The portions are huge, the foods great, and you'll leave with a full happy belly.",

    "text": "True fact: I haven't been to a Mad Mex in over two years.  As you might guess from reading my review of the Shadyside Mad Mex, this is because I've generally been unimpressed with the quality of the food, and I'm not a fan of super-noisy places. However, I'd heard rumors, beginning last year, of a curious and delicious seasonal entree known as the Gobblerito--a burrito filled with turkey, stuffing, and mashed potatoes, with cranberry sauce on the side.  This fall, I vowed to try this chimeric creation, and receiving a $5 off coupon for being on the Big Burrito mailing list sealed the deal.  So, last night, I ventured over to the Oakland Mad Mex, which I'd never visited before, with a friend to consume the beast.  My friend and I started off with 12 oz. pumpkin pie margaritas--this month's margarita flavor--which, thanks to happy hour, were discounted to $3 each.  They were all right, but not quite as flavorful as other margarita flavors I've tried at Mad Mex.  After perusing the menu, she decided to order the portobello enchiladas, whereas I, needless to say, ordered the gobblerito.  Our food came out about 10-15 min. after ordering, and the food runners confused our orders, which I quickly (and passionately) corrected.  The gobblerito, while pretty substantial, wasn't as gargantuan as I'd pictured it--its dimensions were roughly 5\"x8\".  While it was quite delicious, savory, and interesting, I wasn't quite as blown away as I'd hoped to be by the experience.  I found the amount of gravy on it rather skimpy, and the contents weren't evenly distributed throughout the burrito. It was still pretty yummy, however!  Surprisingly, I was able to devour the whole thing in one sitting--although I considered stopping 3/4 of the way through but decided against it, given that there wouldn't have been sufficient leftovers to justify another meal.  Although I didn't try my friend's enchilada, since I was too busy putting away the gobblerito, she told me that it was quite delicious.  However, she pointed out to me that, when she took out the leftovers for her lunch today, she found small pieces of chicken in it, which she hadn't noticed last night due to the dim lighting.  Fortunately, she isn't vegetarian, so this wasn't an issue for her, but this leads me to question their practices when it comes to vegetarian food preparation.  Service was generally good, although it was pretty busy at the time of our visit (6pm).  We were able to get a table right away with no problem.  As for the atmosphere, similar to the Shadyside location, it was quite dark and boisterous, but much smaller and more intimate.  Overall, eating the gobblerito was an interesting experience, and I'd definitely recommend trying it if you haven't before.  It was good enough that I'd probably do it again next year--especially if I receive another coupon--but not perfect by any means.  Truth be told, the gobblerito is about the only food-related reason I'd revisit Mad Mex--though I'd be willing to come back for the margaritas, for sure!",

The inside is also a bit dingy - poorly lit, smells a bit like the entire place has been wiped with a mildewy towel soaked in disinfectant - that smell. A bit unpleasant but not so overwhelming I guess.  The portions are so generous for the price normally, and the deals they do at random times of day/night are even better. We definitely only ate half each in addition to chips and sauces (do the pick 3 for $8! you get a lot of everything).   The food was alright. Pretty good. Nothing out of this world, but above average and exceeded my expectations. And the margaritas were super strong. But it's good! For the price I'm very happy, since it's almost as good as my favorite margarita that costs twice as much. And it's like $3 at happy hour? Can't beat it.  Would I ever crave their food and come out of the way just to eat here? Nah. But happy hour margaritas and some light snacking on cheap food? Hell yes! Unfortunately apparently most of Pitt campus agrees with me so it gets too crowded at night :(",

We arrived around 10:30pm and was starting to get crowded by the bar, since it was so late for normal dinner there were tables and we were promptly seated.  We started off with a Big Azz Strawberry Margarita on the rocks with salt and our friends ordered a Raspberry to split. They were on special 22oz for $7. They came out fast and were strong and had good flavor.    The waitress reminded us that at 11pm the food would be half off, so she said if we wanted to wait a few more minutes with our drinks, she would be happy to bring out the chips and salsa and come back for our orders.  I thought this was really nice of her to make sure we got their late night (11pm-1am) special that features their menu at half price.  I was kinda bummed they didn't have fajitas because I had been craving them, but my boyfriend and I happily settled for the Mad Mex Fajita Burrita with chicken. Also included inside was grilled peppers, onions, black beans and Monterey Jack cheese. We also got the California Grilled Salad with carnitas thanks to the suggestion of our waitress.  It did not disappoint,and was easily large enough for the two of us to split. The lime-cilantro vinaigrette dressing was the perfect addition to the carnitas and avocado in the salad. We were easily stuffed by the end and our bill came to under $20.   The atmosphere at Mad Mex is chill. Very fun and inviting place to hang with friends. I would gladly come back and try Mad Mex for round two!",

Coming from Arizona, I don't normally go to a Mexican restaurant when traveling, but getting a local favorite and house specialty was the way to go. The Gobblerito is white meat turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and corn wrapped in a delicious tortilla and smothered in gravy.

The thing about the Oakland location that really disappoints me is the seating.  I've gone probably 10+ times in the past year and every time I've went with one other person, they seated us in one of two VERY uncomfortable places.  One option is in the middle of the restaurant with people walking back and forth and knocking into your chair every two seconds.  The other option is at a 4-person table sitting next to another couple like we were together, which made things very awkward.  I understand the staff wants to get people sitting down and not waiting by the door but that doesn't make it any less uncomfortable for patrons.  It would highly recommend a new layout to open up some space, but at the end of the day it's a college town restaurant known for its drinks.",

    "text": "Mad Mex Oakland, how I want to love you...I want to love you so bad. In previous reviews of Big Burrito restaurants, I noted that the group could do no wrong. Estaba equivocado--disappointment, thy name is Mad Mex.  I don't want this review to be completely negative, though. The margaritas are awesome. The beer list is sweet. They were one of the few places to sport a keg of the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout last year. Coming in, sitting at the bar (if you can get a seat), getting an appetizer, and having a good ol' fashioned college night on margaritas blurs together some of my favorite memories of Oakland.  Every time I make an attempt to eat a substantial meal there, though, I'm reminded again and again as to why I don't go back for years.  This review is nearly five years in the making. That's almost five years of consistently poor service, mediocre food, and minor mistakes--I've gone through everything from a take-out order being filled incorrectly to being charged for drinks I never received to waiting a long time for a meal (no biggie) only to get the wrong meal (it happens) only to receive the right meal with incorrect options (sour cream instead of guac, what was asked to be on the side wasn't there, etc.).  There have been up-sides to it, though--servers waiting ten or fifteen minutes to put in our order because we want to take advantage of Happy Hour; usually, as long as it isn't too busy, you can hold a nice small conversation with the servers or bartenders; the ice cream burrito is pretty tasty...but, the downsides are all too common, and nothing has changed in the five years that it took to reach these two stars. The gobble-rito seems like a good reason to try again, and I'm sure in another two months, I'll find myself asking, \"Why don't I go back to Mad Mex?\", once again completely forgetting the experiences I've had.  I am so sorry.",

It is still a very consistently decent place to eat, but other establishments, including the fast food places have closed a lot of ground.  Mad Mex still has great chickpea chile, and nachos etc., and the burritos are still a bit different from the standard chicken, beef, pork fare at Chipotle or Qdoba.  But these other establishments are no longer miles away.  Mad Mex could probably do with updating their menu.  At least they still have the thriving bar scene that differentiates.  I think in general, that too many of the reviews revel in the 50% off value as opposed to the intrinsic value of the place.  This is -- to me -- an indication that something needs to give.",

I know this is not meant to be authentic Mexican food but  a Tex-mex  classification doesn't give you the green light to overpower everything on your menu with Chili powder, Cumin and jalapenos.    I'm 1/4 Mexican - grew up with Mexican food - love spicy food - put hot-sauce/salsa on everything - eat jalapenos regularly....   Mad Mex - barley edible.    Gives tex-mex a bad name as I know there is great pride and a lot of heart and soul that goes into True Tex-mex.    I think people go there - get drunk - then think they are eating good food.  Only conceivable way anyone could give this place anything over 2 starts.",

    "text": "Having recently moved to Pittsburgh from San Francisco/Bay Area, it's good to find a place that fills that special niche of places that serve Burritos with tofu as an optional filling. I've been to Mad Mex three times now and each time it has been good. I can't speak to the meat dishes, but the Mad Mex Burrito and Spicy Mad Mex Burrito (both with Marinated Tofu) were delicious, as was the Herbovore Tofu Taco.   I was a bit disappointed by the salsa that came with the tortilla chips. It was too thick and had a strange smokey taste to it, but I can forgive Mad Mex for that, because everything else was good.   Pittsburgh still seems to be missing a good authentic Mexican place that serves up a burrito like you can find in the Mission in SF or pretty much anywhere in CA, but Mad Mex fills its niche nicely.",

    "text": "I had been to this place more than a few times and tried the chicken in just about every shape and form. I've had the Chicken Tacos, the Chicken Burrito, Chicken Fajitas and the Chicken Quesadilla. Someone on here calls it modern Mexican Food, I just call it fancy shmancy and artsy fartsy. No matter what I order it just tastes like it has too much pepper, a little sour and nothing like authentic mexican cuisine. First of all the Salsa sucks. It's just not good at all nor are the chips that go with it. I don't think many people are used to paying $4 or $5 for chips and salsa when they go to a Mexican place. I know I am not. In every other place on the planet It is free and usually arrives almost before you are handed your menus. Last time I went for lunch I tried the Tortilla soup. It had the consistency of a butternut squash soup with zero chicken inside. If I did not read it on the menu and was just handed a cup I would never have guessed what it was. Their Fajitas are painfully average, Not sure if you like paying over $10 for the equivalent of one thinly sliced half chicken breast and some fried peppers and onions. Just seem like less quality than I am used to recieving. The rice is mediocre and usually comes cold on the plate, the black beans have an over bearing peppery taste that I could definately do without. Their roasted red pepper sauce put overtop the Chimichange may be gourmet but it is too sour and tastes like stomach acid. Not really what I would call delicious or even a sought after flavor. I just never got this place. I think it is has more of a draw for people wanting to go drink in a trendy place that is popular with the 20 something dirty panty crowd. In my opinion if you want a good burrito and don't need to have a few drinks before eating it just walk into a Chipotle and pay your $6.50 and be on your way. Save yourself from overpriced food and over tipping the short stocky waitress with glasses, messy hair and no makeup on that seem to be in every Mad Mex. I think it must be a pre-requisite to working there.",

(fine, I won't).  Seriously Mad Mex was a place that was known for its after 11 \"half price food\" and kickass drinks.  I remember a night with my friends where we sat across from a table of girls that were more interested in each other than us, we ate a shitload of food with habanero sauce on it, and we drank a lot.  College was exactly that.  The observance of women, the ingesting of food, and the imbibing of beers.  Awesomeness that I'd love to repeat.  Daily.  Just go there and love it.  Don't debate its qualities of food or its noise-issues.  Just love unconditionally like a dog.  I do.",

I fell in love with their chick pea chili burritos.    Con - they wouldn't or couldn't make them without onions for me and it's too fucking dark to see to pick the onions out.  Pro - since it's too fucking dark to see to pick the onions out I just gave in and ate them and learned to like something I otherwise might not have tried/liked.    I really hate how dark and loud it is here.  It's kind of pointless to go in a big group because you're only going to be able to talk to the people immediately next to and across from you and it's a pain in the ass to get seated.  I much prefer the McKnight Rd location - is it still there??  Every time I am back in Pgh I mean to try the Robinson Town Centre location but I always forget until we are driving to the airport and I see it.  Maybe next time...  Love their chips and salsa.  Love their black bean garlic dip.  As I said already love their chick pea chili (have learned to make a knock-off to satisfy me out here in CA but it's just not the same...)  But avoid this location unless you're hurting for cash and/or have no transportation.  It's worth a little extra money to be able to see your food and hear your dinner companions.",

It is a tiny building, and it is often *loud*.  The later you go, the louder it gets.  Personally, I think a lot of their burritos taste the same, though it is a very good taste.  I like their pickadippa and potato taquitos.  They also offer lots of options, like meatless or vegan versions, or the choice to turn a burrito into an enchilada, and vice versa.  Everything is priced decently, with half-price food at a variety of times (depending on the location) and lots of great specials for holidays and such.  The Big Azz margaritas are enormous.  I enjoy the frozen strawberry.  I often get the small, and I usually can't finish it.",

Since there was a long wait we got margaritas and waited for the tables.  I got a strawberry margarita, but the flavor was unnecessary as all I could taste was cheap, nasty tequila.  Gross.  To mitigate the taste and try not to be sloshed before dinner we asked for some chips and salsa while we waited.  When we finally got some (15 minutes later) I was buzzed and disappointed.  The chips and salsa were worse than even the store brand from the supermarket.  My opinion, if a \"Mexican food\" restaurant can't do the good chips and salsa and margaritas, I don't even want to try anything else.  We paid our tab and left before our table was even ready.

The food took half an hour longer than they said it would be, and when we made it home, the entree I had ordered (and been charged for) was missing from our overall order. They refused to send the order via their delivery company (which in fairness was open another 15 minutes), but they offered me a free entree card that they are supposedly going to send me in the mail. Hopefully it won't disappear on the way here.  The entree card is all well and good, but my family was less than impressed with the restaurant I took as a representation of Pittsburgh - Mad Mex.

I always come on weeknights with my friends for $7 frozen margs, which are huge and delicious, and half off food. They have countless vegan and vegetarian options. I always get the vegan nachos and tofu wrapture. One of my favorite places to go in Oakland.",

    "text": "I never not have a good time at Mad Mex, but I feel like I never have an outstanding time.   We got there after walking around in the heat for the better part of the morning. I think my entire party breathed a sigh of relief whenever we got into the air conditioning. I was pretty excited that it was looking slow when we got inside for lunch. Usually there is a crowd and the kitchen tends to take a bit. But today it was sparsely occupied so I had a good feeling about it.   We got sat right away and ordered some chips. This is my problem. The waitress never asked what type of salsa we wanted with our chips. She brought out one and it was too hot for the table. We didn't not like it, but it wouldn't have been our choice. So when she asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa we said yes, but asked for a change in the salsa, but, and maybe this is how it is always done, we got charged for the change in the salsa. I thought that that was kinda weird. But, maybe that is how it is supposed to be done?  Appetizers: Chips and Salsa: I would suggest going for the corn salsa, it is my favorite and always a go to for me. Really fresh tasting and chunky. My favorite of all the salsas.   Lunch: WING SALAD:Boneless chicken wings in your choice of wing sauce (see previous page) roost on mesclun greens, cucumber, red onion, cherry tomatoes and Monterey Jack cheese. Ranch or bleu cheese dressing on the side.: I get the honey chipotle bbq, BUT always on the side. Honey chipotle bbq is my favorite of all of the wing sauces. I tried to like the San Francisco, it didn't happen. The salad was super fresh and all of the veggies in it were crunchy and fresh. I enjoyed it. It was refreshing. I was also really impressed about how much chicken was on the salad. I was not expecting that much. This salad was also big enough that I brought it for lunch the next day because I could not even try to eat it all. YUMMM. I will be getting this again. I think I might have found a new favorite thing here! It was a perfect mix of wing and salad, two of the things that I wanted but in one lunch choice!  Drinks:  Here is where the stars dropped. Our table ordered 3 WATERMELON MULE s BUT THEN..... The bar tender came to our table and said that he had only enough stuff to make one. He was in the process of making the stuff but....for now only one was left. That is fine... But two of our party were disappointed.  I got a margarita that was mango/raspberry and it was great. No complaints about those at all. Yummy and refreshing.  THEN I ordered the PINEAPPLE BASIL MARGARITA. It was just eh. I didn't think that it tasted like pineapple or basil!! I couldn't really pick out what it tasted like other than boozey. Eh. Probably not going to order it again. I was really excited to try this and it left me just kinda, sad?  I work in Oakland so I will be back soon.  Not to get the pineapple margarita but probably for my favorite new salad!!",

The wait in was a bit long, but it was worth it!  Once we sat down, service was slightly chippy at times but it made sense since there were so many people in for late night.   I ordered the southwestern wings which were surprisingly crispy and flavorful, and the nachos we shared had super tasty guac on top!   Overall, great portions, great food, but crazy crowd and super noisy! Definitely making a return for late night, because no crowd is gonna stop me from eating!",

I've never had a meal I didn't enjoy and the fact that each entree comes out to about $6 makes it that much better. My go-to is a classic Mad Mex burrito with tofu. When I'm looking for a sweeter option, I'll go for the Tofu Wrapture with honey bbq sauce. I highly recommend the waffle fries for your side - crispy, greasy heaven! Aside from being insanely delicious, their menu is a vegetarian's dream. Almost everything can be made vegetarian/vegan with the substitutions they offer. They even have vegan ranch and vegan cheese! If you still have room afterwards, the Big Azz Brownie is the perfect ending to a meal and the best way to ensure a food coma (or diabetes). Nothing but 5 stars for my favorite Oakland restaurant!!",

    "text": "Try to come here when it's half off, it feels so good when you get that bill and see that tiny number. You may have to wait but it is so worth. I've had a few things here that I'll go over and rate.   Frozen strawberry margarita is super huge and delicious - 4/5 Mad mex burrito is nice, it is simple and just has beans and rice cheese and meat inside. I had chicken in mine which was good. The tortilla is kinda lame. It is pretty good, and rather large, but not mind blowing or anything - 3/5 Nachos with chicken were SOOOO good, you get so much stuff, the chips are crunchy and yummy and it comes with cheese, chicken, and ... I don't know what else honestly but it was good. I did ask the waiter if there was anything spicy on it and skipped the jalapenos, but I believe the tomatoes or the guac was too much for me so I scraped it off. And then I kept eating. 4.5/5 I also had the wing-o tacos. I mistakenly came here with my friend once when it was not half off, so I was missing that TINY BILL HIGH that is a large part of the reason I come here. The tacos are not normally half off so I decided to try them. Anyways, these are tacos with some boneless wings in them. I got them because they come with some JERSEY CHIPS on the side, which you will understand later in my review. I had a hard time picking the sauce for the wings because they all sounded very not my thing. I settled on the southwestern wings and asked my server how the heat level at a mild level would be and she said there would be none. Well, once again, I am a huge baby who should not trust my server and they were too much for me. The sauce also had a bit of a ranchy taste which I hate. It was kinda lame, there wasn't much to it so it just tasted like I had some large pieces of meat with a sauce I didn't like wrapped in thin, soggy tortillas. 2/5  Finally, I will dedicate a whole paragraph to Mad Mex and their jersey chips. You get a huge basket of waffle fries which are perfectly fried - super crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I like to ask for ketchup with mine. Seriously, these are literally the best fries I have ever had. If you're just here with your buddies and you don't like Mexican food just get two orders of these. If you're not sure what to get, just get two orders of these. If you're getting something already, get an order of this to complement your meal. If you think you ordered enough and can't eat it all, but have not ordered these jersey chips, then you should still order them. A trip to Mad Mex is meaningless if you do not have jersey chips. I would even consider paying full price for the jersey chips (jk haha that wouldn't happen) I will give these fries an easy 10/5.  GET THE JERSEY CHIPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Honestly, I come here for the nostalgia of my Pitt days 15 years ago. But every time I do, I regret it. I know, it's my own fault for going out in Oakland.   The hostesses here are almost always surly and dismissive. The blonde one I most recently dealt with was less a hostess and more a referee, explaining all of the rules and regulations that this location has with bill splitting, parties at a table, paying at the bar, whatever. She was far less interested in accommodating us as she was in arguing with us.  On the bright side, the food was excellent, as always.   Anyway, If you're an adult who isn't trying to pretend you're still 19, hit up the Shadyside or Monroeville locations with the exact same food, more space, and none of the hassle. This location would get less stars if it wasn't on me for knowing better than to come here.  But if you're a college student, this is your spot. Five stars.",

Wings are 1/2 off during happy hour, so I got a small order of Southwestern wings, which are dressed with cilantro, olive oil, lime and garlic. I was full, a little buzzed, and my bill totaled to about $10.  This location is dark, loud, and tables are really cramped.

After living in Seattle and Salt Lake City and being perpetually disappointed in my attempts to find a decent \"happy hour,\" I have found myself describing the gem that is Mad Mex to many people I meet.  But, alas, after being reminded of a few of the below mentioned rules, I, remorsefully, still feel 3 stars is the right choice.  If you're not a student desperate for late-night deals, may I recommend the Shadyside location, which is much larger as less strict?   During happy hour, (4:30-6:30 weekdays) buy two 12oz Margs (=24 oz for $6) instead of 1 big azz margarita ( 22oz for $7). Big Azz Margs and most food are 1/2 price after 11 pm.  Sangria swirl is the way to go--according to the bartender, this is an extra \"serving\". Vegans rejoice--vegan cheese and cream cheese are available if you ask!! The Oakland location does require at least half the party to order food to be seated at a table, and the entire party has to be present to be seated at all (depending on the hostess even be put on the waiting list!).  Chips are free at the bar, but will will be charged the menu price of sitting at a table... if it weren't for all the annoyances I've had with their weird rules I may give this a 4 or a 5.  Food is delicious!!!",

    "text": "The food here is usually good - the thai burrito is unique and tasty and the fried tofu is delicious even for a non-tofu eater. The margaritas are fantastic, especially when they're discounted for happy hour and late night. I like the seasonal variations as well as the usual flavors. A few margs and a pickadippa is always a good decision.  The service at this location, however, is bad. The restaurant is small and as a result the servers rush you in and out. I have been here at least two dozen times, and almost every time the servers have been at best inattentive and at worst blatantly rude if we stay at the table longer than 2 minutes after the entree is done. This doesn't just happen when the restaurant is busy - we were there a few days ago in an almost empty restaurant on a Thursday night and two waitresses stood four feet away from us and glared for 30 minutes. Everyone at my table commented on how uncomfortable it was.   I really do like Mad Mex at this location and I'm going to keep going because I love the margaritas - but the service needs to improve.",

Ordered a red sangria, the pickadippa app, a cup of tortilla soup and the original mad mex burrito (needless to say I brought home multiple boxes). The sangria was delicious (and cheap -$5!), we got the original salsa, guacamole and hummus, and all three were delicious. The tortilla soup came out not hot but they took it off my bill and the manager was more than accommodating. The food was great, and we got student discounts (half off food from 2-4) as well as the yummy sangrias. Can't wait to come back for Wednesday happy hour and late night menu! Definitely one of my new favorite places!",

    "text": "I only go to Mad Mex for two things: $7 Big Azz Margaritas from 9 pm to midnight and half-off food from 11 pm to 1 am. The Mex earns a spot in the lineup for 21st birthdays and other occasions that merit bar-hopping and all-night drinking (e.g. midterms, breakups, Tuesdays).  The food is consistent and tasty, though not exactly the most authentic Mexican food ever.  There are lots of option for vegetarians and even vegans. I have to eat gluten-free and they've always been accommodating and knowledgeable. Free chips and salsa at the bar is nice.  Why does this place get 3 stars instead of 4? Couple reasons: 1. Stupid policy of not serving alcohol if there are people under 21 at the table. Sucks when you're out with your underage friends and want some tequila with your enchilada. 2. You won't get a table during peak hours unless you're ordering a legit meal. Nachos to share don't count. Which leads me to... 3. Super crowded. Very difficult to get a seat at the bar on busy nights.  Also, one little weird complaint: the bar is sloped and uneven, so it's VERY easy to have a bowl of salsa or even your drink (dios mio!) slip off, particularly once you've had a few.",

It is a burrito with chicken and you get to have your favorite wing sauce in it.  The los wingos wrap is also good and the waffle fries that come with it are amazing especially wen dipped in the spicy blue cheese dressing that they come with.  Always always make sure to get chips and salsa as a starter.  They have a number of different kinds of salsa and I like every one I've tried.  When you are not so hungry there is el no bono.  They are boneless wings.  We are not talking chicken fingers dipped into wing sauce...this is the real thing only without the bone.  Yum!  Then there are the \"big ass\" margaritas.  They are really good.  They have a lot of different flavors and you can get them either frozen or on the rocks.  I like the original on the rocks with salt and the strawberry frozen.  They also have rotating margarita flavors based on the season.  This is the original Mad Mex location and although it is quite small, I consider it the best.  The atmosphere, the music, the workers, the crowd, all make Mad Mex is great.  It does not have the family feel like the suburban locations which I think is good.",

Mad Mex was a few blocks away tucked away in the south oakland student neighborhhod.  After a giant plate of nachos,  and a tall margarita, the world was suddenly looking brighter.  In addition to the tasty margaritas, I was pleasantly surprised to find they had about a dozen craft beers on tap as well. They were running a special on Bells, $5 for 22 oz,   I tried the smitten golden rye, while my  IPA loving husband had the two hearted ale.  they were both exellent and went great with the food.  The food itself was decent if nothing amazing. I thought the nachos were a little dry, the burrito was good though.  the menu is huge and there are a lot of vegetarian options. would come back,especially for the craft beers.",

Essentially these are a giant glass of tequila with a splash of flavoring. Frozen or on the rocks. As a broke college student I can say I'd happily pay the price for one of these because I know I'm getting what I'm paying for. Recently found out you can mix flavors too, highly recommend strawberry and mango. They also have happy hour in the afternoon and after 9pm which is nice.

The atmosphere at Mad Mex is always fun in terms of the decor but this location is excessively loud in my opinion and I found that I was screaming just so my friend could hear me. This location is also very small and cramped. They make seating tight in other locations too in my experience, but the overall space is much smaller here making it worse.

Waitress didn't give my friend full change back and when asked she simply said she rounded up and walked away. The spicy burrito was ok but it's really not worth the price and overall experience there. Another time I had their chickpea chili and that might be one of the worst things I've ever tasted.",

We went in after cling and asking if there was a wait an if they were busy. We were sat right away and our order was take. Almost immediately. That's when the wait started. We were told there was only one line cook after we complained. We waited for 40 minutes to get our food, then they messed up on our order and gave us chicken instead of stake on our enchiladas. We repeatedly reminded them that we had been waiting and that we needed to leave soon. We got our food soon after and had to scarf it down to make our appointment. The food was ok, but it was definitely thrown together on our plate. As much as we would have liked to enjoy it and savor it it was definitely disappointing. As someone from the LA area and living in the Chicago area, I'm biased to Mexican inspired food but this falls short by a long shot.",

Nothing! This trip to mad Max I had one of their seasonal dishes which was a chicken and grilled corn burrito it was good but not my favorite burrito out there. The best seasonal item on the summer menu are the grilled street corn and steak tacos. Right now is peach margarita month through the end of August so if you love peaches to go and get one!  We sat at the bar and the bartender was super friendly helpful and gave all-around great service. We will be back again that is for sure!",

However, they were fairly dry and lacking in sauce yesterday. At the Shadyside location, my wings are smothered in the sauce with some to spare if I choose to dip my chicken it. I will continue to go to the Shadyside location as there is also more room to breathe there.",

It is a little on the pricey side as far as this kind of Mexican food goes (as with all kinds of cuisine, quality justifies a higher price, and I think the balance is slightly off at this place), but everything is delicious. Their chickpea chilli is served in a verde sauce, and their mushroom burrito is very flavorful.   The atmosphere is usually chill during the day or in the summer when most undergrads are gone. the service is pretty good too. Sometimes I think wait staff could come by a little more often to refill drinks when they are on the less-busy side, but overall everyone is very friendly and professional.",

I honestly have never had to wait but they sure know how to cram people in the smallest possible space.   What I normally order is the Los wingos wrap. I get the boneless wings with the honey bbq sauce. There is also (Mexican?) rice inside so it's very filling. I normally order it with waffle fries since you get to choose a side.  The big azz Margarita is also a fav. I normally order strawberry, but in August the flavor of the month was peach. That was also tasty and their list of Margaritas is lengthy.. Still need to try the sangria Margarita.   The mad Mex burrito is also good. I always get it with chicken. I've also had the curry burrito (with chicken). It honestly wasn't my fav. I barely tasted the curry. It was more of a marinated or seasoned chicken than that curry taste. However, the peanuts and pineapple were a nice touch. The bean spouts were not a good touch and the Mexican slaw also wasn't appealing to my taste buds.. Maybe some but not mine.  The chimi is probably my favorite. It's really delicious!!!! This is not offered as half priced. It comes with beans and Mexican rice as a side but of course the chimi is the star of the show!!  Bobby and I have split the nacho grande and then once our food was delivered, we were too full to eat.. Piled highhhh but very good though. Honestly two people ordering drinks and nachos is plenty to catch up or as a snack.  Mad Mex is still satisfying in my book.",

Their menu is pretty diverse. I ordered the enchiladas with mole sauce. I've never had mole sauce before so I didn't know what to expect. I know mole is made with chocolate in it which is interesting so I wanted to try it. I also ordered the orange pineapple margaritas I wasn't a huge fan of the margarita since it had chunks of fruit in it and the texture just made it odd. The enchiladas we're good but when I got more to the middle of the enchiladas it got too chocolatey for me there wasn't to much spice or anything to off put how sweet It was. I would go back since they have such a diverse menu it seems like there is something for everyone on it. P.s it was super busy and our food came out really fast!",

Went out tonight after a long day with my 25-year-old friend, who has a very valid NY ID. We were looking forward to drinks and meals, and our waiter refused her service for a margarita. When she asked to speak to the manager, the manager claimed it was a fake, and said \"I'm 28, I know what a New York license looks like.\" Recently, New York updated their IDs to a newer, less flimsy version, so if anything, the state of her older ID showed her age.    Oakland is a college town. My friend and I go out to restaurants and bars with scanners, and there's never any problem. A smart business move would be to invest in a scanner, or provide a more rigorous training in identifying cards from different states. Not only was the manager unable to verify a valid ID, but she was rude about it. This reflects poorly on the restaurant and the management.   I couldn't be more disappointed with this experience. This isn't the responsible way to conduct business in a college town. I work in the restaurant business, I know things can be rough and everyone has a bad day, but this situation was unacceptable and so frustrating. There's no excuse to be denying VALID forms of ID by eye in this day and age.   I've always enjoyed dining at your restaurant, but this experience was beyond unsatisfactory. Please consider making a change, Mad Mex Oakland.",

And they have lots of deals so it's a great way to be able to go out, have some dinner and a few drinks, and not spend a lot of money.  It's also a great place to take a larger group. We've never had a problem getting seated together with groups of 10 people, or maybe more.  Just don't arrive before the rest of your group. They won't seat you until everyone is there, which is kind of annoying.  My main criticism goes to the atmosphere, but it's not the restaraunt's fault, really. When it's packed and there's lots of drunk college kids, well yeah. That can get annoying. And the waitresses there have given me attitude more often than not. I just kind of expect it now when I go, so when a hostess or waitress is nice to me, I'm pleasantly surprised.",

This location (they have several around the state) was the first and helped the Big Burrito Restaurant Group get off the ground.    The space is cozy, and can be somewhat cavernous during the daylight hours.  The decor is wild.  Staff is nice and consistently busy.  The college crowd can take over this place in a hurry, so get to happy hours early and try to get a table just before the late night specials start.    I recommend the Kristy's Big Sister Red Velvet Quesadilla.  It's chicken, cheese, zucchini, and spinach combination is great with the salsa, guacamole and just a dab of sour cream.  Wing fan?  Try the San Francisco glaze with either the \"mild, wild, or insane\" hotness factor.  (I can't eat the insane wings...just too darn hot).  Also, try the variety of Monday through Friday lunch combinations.",

I decided to change it up this time (my standby meal is shrimp funguy taquitos and the black bean and pineapple quesadilla with tofu). I ordered the black bean soup and the Pennsyltucky fried tofu. The tofu was a knockout! So crispy and flavorful, with nice sprigs of cilantro and sprouts on the side. Loved the salty warm peanuts too. The soup was meant to be like the Kiva black bean dip, but the dip is so decadent (read: fattening) and spicy, while the soup is just watery and missing the cheesy rich goodness of the dip, which I guess I should've expected. But still, it was all delicious.   My friends got the burritos, which I think are amazing, but sort of boring compared to everything else on the menu. I ordered a big azz mango marg, per the usual and was not dissappointed. I LOVE this place. Everytime i'm in the city I will go here. It's a must!",

The burritos and wings are top notch. I don't even have to review the big azz margs. Just know they're out of this world if you haven't tried one yet. The decor is bitchin. So are the skelly's in the restroom. The menu is really fun to read. Just like my reviews. I want lights like they have. You know, the green ones in the jelly jars hanging on ropes? Yeah.",

Be on the lookout for their new sister joint, Mad Mex Beyond Wingdome, which is set to open soon, underneath the unicorn mural in the Strip District.  You're going to want to hold on to your hats for that one, as they are taking Mad Mex's famous \"road warrior\" approach to traditional Oaxacan cuisine to an entirely new level.  Some might say that some of their food is unnecessarily dangerous, but if you've ever had their mole electric eel taco platter, a steal at $17, you'll know that it's more than worth the risk.  And if you haven't had their piranha-and-potato burrito - also for $17, as is everything else on their menu - you simply haven't lived.  I'm not sure if there's outdoor seating or not, I'm going to have to go back to find out. Maybe I'll see Mel there!",

That said, some of the food is good and it's better than most other Oakland options (which is damning with faint praise). Things that are okay: carnitas burrito, mahi-mahi salad (w/o the chipoltle aioli), pineapple habanero salsa. The margaritas are okay, but if you claim to be anything \"mex\", you better have okay margaritas.  On the whole, this place needs to turn down the music, turn up the lights, make the menu a little less colorful and focus on having consistent service and food prep. Oh, and while I'm at it, that blue cornbread is disgusting.  Oh, and to say that it's not good for kids is an understatement. They play very loud music with explicit lyrics and have drunk people stumbling around at 5pm. Leave junior at home.",

HOWEVER, you don't go to Mad Mex for authentic Mexican food, you go there for delicious fusion burritos, cheap and deadly margaritas, and loud music.  I live in California, home of the burrito, and I still miss Mad Mex.  When I get a chance to come back to visit Pittsburgh, I make a point to enjoy myself a red velvet burrito or a dance marathon burrito, and of course a Mad Mex Margarita.  I was pleasantly surprised last time I visited to find the new no smoking policy here.  Anyways, this place is great for half-price food and half-price margaritas.  It isn't just because I was in college either.  I would also mention here, that drinking 33oz of generously tequila-ed margarita isn't the best (and certainly not the worst) idea before attending your ex's wedding.  If you decide on this, I'd recommend not breaking the seal and making sure it isn't a catholic wedding first.",

We didn't wait to sit - but we did take the last open table.  The server was attentive and got everything right the first time around.  We loved the intimate (noisy) atmosphere.  The music is lively, and so is the crowd.  All of the things we had were great - my 11 year-old son devoured his wings.  My 15 year-old daughter elected to go with the fried tofu appetizer as her entree, and she took almost half of it home.  I had to try it myself, and thought it was a nice sweet blend of sesame, soy and peanut flavor...  Not really Tex-Mex, per se, but hey, it's delicious!  My steak burrito was full of flavor, and my wife had the mahi fish tacos, which she loved.  The prices were really great - with my wife and I each having two beers (we walked back to the hotel), the total price was under $70.  That's a pretty good deal, no matter what city you're in.  Loved it, and we'll be back next time in town!",

It's my absolutely favorite uber-americanized-californized-tex-mex-bar-restaurant-voodoo-lounge in the whole world!   They're unabashedly american-tex-mex here, but they also respect their Pittsburgh roots. You can get a buffalo chicken burrito here. Try finding THAT in San Francisco! You can even get your burrito with cross-cut fries. oh Pittsburgh - i miss you - sometimes.   That said, they actually do have awesome, humungous, fork-and knife burritos such as Super Mad Mex with Steak. So good. When they say spicy, they mean spicy. The restaurant has the coolest logo ever (I bought 2 pint glasses to take home with me). The service is great, if not eccentric.   They have half-off food after 11pm, in the Oakland tradition. However, its typically way too crowded at that time to eat successfully. The lesser-known secret is they do half-off lunch from 2-4pm Mon-Thursday. This is a much better way to go.   FYI: The chips/salsa are free at the bar but not at the table. Also, they will try to sell you guacamole and sour cream with every dish - but it's not free!  Mad Mex also has a decent selection of beer on tap, including, at various times, Rogue Dead Guy, Delirium Tremens, et al. And of course, they have IC Lite and Yeungling for the pittsburgher in you.  So go, get a huge-azz margarita, some beer, some great food, and stumble down atwood street drunk with the rest of the crowd.",

It's a great place to take a date because it's loud!  If you like the girl (or boy) you have to lean in close to talk.

I also enjoy their chips and Kaya Yucatan Black Bean Dip. Be warned that they often seem to run out of basic ingredients very early. My friend ordered the Chopper Salad once only to be told that they were out of chickpeas and 2 other main ingredients. If you drink, you should know that the drinks here can be a bit pricey. The service is slow and the wait staff isn't too attentive. The music is so loud that you won't really be able to have any type of conversation with the people around you. During the half-price promotional period the place is always packed with college students so come early to reserve a seat or be prepared to wait for 15-30 minutes.

Wanted Mexican but didn't want the national chain stuff like Chipotle and Qdoba (which are right on Forbes Avenue,  basically Eatery Row).   We took a four block walk from the main drag and saw the neighborhood get a little seedier as we walked.   The outside of Mad Mex looks scantily enticing and the inside of the place just a little but better (I loved the Mexican Day of the Dead artwork, though).   Our waitress was prompt and friendly but never overboard.   My son order a vegetarian dish and I ordered a house special enchilada.   Both were excellent.  My dish had spinach & zucchini,  two things I didn't expect in a chicken enchilada.   But it definitely added to the entree which was perfectly spiced.   The place also has a very good bottle &  draft menu.  Prices were compatible to other Mexican restaurants.   All in all,  a worthwhile trip off the beaten path.   I will definitely.  I will definitely be making g another trip here when I return in August with my son & wife.",

    "text": "I love Mad Mex, despite the fact this location is tiny and crowded. Any Mad Mex is going to be great in my opinion, but this one is close to my heart since I spent my 21st birthday there.  We come pretty often for happy hour (4:30 - 6:30) where you'll find half-off drafts and wings. They don't advertise it, but I think you may get a discount on all margaritas, not just the big azz ones ($7 opposed to $10). The margaritas are THE reason to go, in my opinion (avoid the hibiscus peach one - it's pretty hard to drink and $12). Until the end of November they have cranberry and pumpkin margaritas as well. The pumpkin is surprisingly delicious. I'm not sure if it's only during happy hour, but you get free (and refilled) chips and spicy salsa at the bar.  But wait, there's more: they serve damn tasty food! And with half price starting at 11 (luckily one of the \"select items\" are the burritos), you can't pass it up.",

I don't care that this one is smaller but the food is just so below par. We've been twice in hopes that it would have been better the second time but no. Food was okay, beer/drinks were good and staff was nice. i love Mad Mex for their extensive vegetarian and vegan options but there was something missing from the food here. I'm going to give it one more shot.",

Never got kids menus. We caught the wait staff glaring at us multiple times, including eye contact. We tried to flag down the wait staff multiple times and were ignored. Finally left the restaurant, it was the most discriminated I've ever felt in my life. Wasted so much time parking in Oakland to boot, worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Don't seat your guests and then treat them terribly.  Normally love Big Burrito restaurants, been to many, always felt welcome as  a parent and patron. This was terrible.",

Flavor was nice but temperature threw me off. Also ordered the Mad Mex quesadilla, the vegetables tasted good and fresh but the chicken was very dry and there was barley any cheese on the quesadilla. The restaurant has a good but there are things to be desired.    Also the service was awful. As a server myself I was confused. Never got her name. She noticed that we were still waiting on people in our party so just left us (didn't even take our drink order) and didn't come back for 10 min. We had to ask for everything, napkins, refills, our checks. We even had to ask to appetizers and dessert included (interesting to me bc as a server I would want to up the tab by offering those items).   I could over look the sub par food if the service was good but both were lacking. (Service especially)",

It would have been nice if my waitress could have microwaved my chowder for another minute but she could obviously not be bothered. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, i got it within 4 minutes of ordering it, presumably, because it took that long to microwave it. It tasted like freezer, the chicken was rubbery, and the salsa was literally just diced tomatoes with salt. There is nothing Mexican about this place. The food isn't Mexican, the people who work there are all Caucasian and clearly know nor care to know what Mexican food should look or taste like.   I'd sooner eat gas station sushi with a glass of tap water from Flint, Michigan and then let mike Tyson uppercut my stomach before I come back and eat here. My stomach sure felt like the latter once I left this place.",

Its best feature is that after 10pm you can get a 22oz Margarita for $7, which is probably the cheapest way to get yourself on the way to a good evening at a bar in Pittsburgh. The margaritas themselves are nothing too special; however people who are on their second may say differently (this includes me).  The food is fine but nothing special and the place is extremely loud, crowed, and dark. It takes a while to get a table and even if you just want to stand at the bar it is often hard to find a good spot. Also for college students there is the added irritation that they enforce a rule that if anyone at the table is under 21 then nobody can drink unless you have somebody over 25.",

    "text": "The four reasons why I've never paid full price for anything at Mad Mex before:  2-4 PM: Half priced entrees w/ student ID 4:30-6:30 PM: Half priced wings and $7 BIG AZZ Margaritas 9:00PM -12:00 AM: $7 BIG AZZ Margaritas After 11:00 PM: Half priced entrees  Anyways, on with the food.  Mad Mex serves up super Americanized Tex-Mex and they don't pretend to be authentic by any means.  They have burritos, tacos, nachos, salads, wings, you name it.  For me, I go solely for their wings.  A large order of 14 wings ($4.50 when half off) is more than sufficient, and pair that with a $7 BIG AZZ margarita and everything is good.  Flavor of choice?  San Francisco.  All their flavors are good and their wings are some of the better wings I've had in Pittsburgh in terms of how well they're cooked.  If I'm not getting wings, what would I get?  Wing-o-rito.  It's a burrito w/ chicken inside that's smothered in wing sauce.  Okay, I really like their wings.  Try their double dipper with black bean dip too!  It's super hearty, slightly spicy, and pairs perfectly with a margarita.  If you go at night, it gets LOUD.  And the place also fills up fast after 11 PM, so you might have to wait if you don't arrive early.",

    "text": "Great Tex Mex food served in an extremely trendy restaurant.  The restaurant offers half price food from 11.00 PM onwards so its always packed with students. The nachos grande and the honey barbecue wings are my favorite things there.  They also offer a wide selection of margaritas and beers and is a perfect place to go to when you don't have a lot of work to do for the next day.   The only negative aspect of this Mad Mex is the lack of seating. There is almost definitely a 20 minute wait if you go for food after 11.00PM so it's better to go there at around 10.30 PM put your name down on the list.   Although I have not been there for lunch, I have heard that they haven half off from 2.00 to 4.00 if you show a valid student ID.",

The ground beef is well seasoned and awesome. I like the coleslaw even though I don't really like coleslaw. Student half off 2-4pm Mon-Thurs.  The bad: The chicken can be a little dry or chewy. The rice is blah.  Overall, my favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. Big Burrito, the restaurant group which owns Mad Mex and other Pittsburgh staples like Eleven, Soba, and Phipps Cafe, manages to fuse Mexican dishes with their signature inventiveness and style to create menu items which are by no means culturally authentic but taste very good.",

    "text": "I went to the University of Pittsburgh for undergrad and my friends and I would go to mad mex all the time. So when I came back to Pittsburgh for the weekend, I thought it would be cool to stop by MadMex for old time's sake. When we arrived, the place was packed - a good sign. Two men got up from the bar so we told the waitress to get us the next available table and we would order drinks while we waited. Everyone ordered the big azz margs, which is what mad mex was known for when I was in school. I got a frozen mango marg. Sounds good right? Well, the marg itself tasted nothing like mango, it was more of an orange juice flavor. Then, after the first sip I realized that there are chunks of something floating around and getting in my mouth. Even the mango marg on the rocks, which one of my friends ordered, had chunks of something floating around. It was so weird. Then, the waitress comes back saying that there is an available table, and we're like \"great! Lead the way.\" But then she asks us whether we are going to order food. I look at her, confused, and say \"well my friend just ordered food but I think the rest of us don't want anything to eat.\" Then she refused to seat us because we have to buy more food if we want to sit down. I was shocked, and confused, because I had been to Mad Mex so many times in undergrad just to get drinks and I was always seated. When I questioned her she says \"well my manager is right over there, you can ask him.\" I turn, look at him, and question him about this policy. I ask whether we all have to purchase food to be seated. He says, no, so long as at least one of you is ordering something. Ironically he is delivering the chips and cheese my friend had just ordered at that moment, so I say well, \"she ordered something, it's right there.\" He then said that it didn't count because she ordered it at the bar, but she only ordered it there because we were waiting for a table. I understand if it's just easier to separate the bar stuff from the seated table stuff, but this is a situation in which the circumstances called for a little leeway, since we made it clear when we walked in that we wanted a table. So of course I get upset and tell him he can take the order back and start a new one when we are seated. And I was quite serious about it, because this policy was so strange. Had we been seated right away instead of going to the bar, would they have told us to get up and stand when they realized that most of us just came for the drinks? Anyway, I left Mad Mex fuming, and I told myself I would write a review. Not to get back at them because at the end of the day I got the marg , although disappointing, and I was seated at a table. My purpose in writing this review is to let people know about this policy if they plan on going, and to let you all know not to get the mango marg. I still feel like there's chunks in my throat. However, my friend had the strawberry one and drank it all without complaint so if you're going for a marg, that's the one.",

Sometimes the theme-ish-ness can be a little overdone, but I think it's fun.  At night the place gets really loud and filled with college students there for drinks. During the day they have some great lunch specials. It's always really dark.  There's much better Tex-Mex in other parts of the country, but this is some of the best you'll find in Pittsburgh. I enjoy some of their experiments (if you're bored of a particular dish try the shrimp version).  If you're not one for loud, crowded restaurants, I do recommend trying it during lunchtime. You might want to bring a flashlight to read the menu though.",

Eclectic, college-type environment so go prepared for noisy fun, a wide selection of beverages, and some great food (don't deprive yourself the homemade chips and guac). I went for the Spicey Mad Mex burrito which was pleasantly spicy and not overwhelming. The only reason for not 5 stars was due to the way four seriously drunk, disruptively sloppy and loud, middle-aged women were handled. A festive atmosphere is one thing, but these pigs went way beyond that, for the entire time we were there, and I think the management could have gone further to deal with it. But it was a tricky situation, and we were guests to this town, so whatever... Go. You won't be dissappointed!",

But hey, it's a Mexican place.   The more recent times, however, I've enjoyed their seasonal chicken and corn burrito which was actually  very tasty. But I was once again disappointed at my last visit.   I arrived after 11 for the half priced deal, and received half the quality of the food. I asked for my burrito with no jalapenos as usual, and it came with jalapenos. Didn't bother sending it back because it was half off and I didn't want to be a pain. But now, I wish I did.   I took my first 3 bites of all rice. Continued and had maybe 2-3 pieces of chicken, and boxed the rest. As I eat my leftovers, I can literally count 1 piece of chicken in over half of the burrito. I literally had more jalapenos than chicken. I thought Mad Mex had finally won me over, but I was wrong. Skip the food, just get a margarita.",

I love the Day of the Dead artwork and atmosphere, though it can be a bit dark and loud sometimes. When it's warm they open the window and have an outdoor bar that you can sit at, which is nice. The food is always consistently good and you get A LOT of food. Margs are always great, though the frozen mango one clogs your straw a lot with the chunks. I love that they have a ton of vegan and vegetarian options, although they have messed up my orders a few times so be careful to check if you follow a strict diet like that.   You get the best bang for your buck if you go while it is half off food from 11-1am--I got this huge burrito for $6! The half off discount does not apply to tacos, the chimi, or desserts, so be aware of that. Also, it's always crowded during this time no matter the day of the week so you may have to wait a bit.   Overall, Mad Mex is an Oakland staple and I'm grateful to live down the street from it for whenever a late night craving strikes, but it's rare for me to shell out the money for the food at full price.",

At 50% off, it's a decent place if you're willing to wait and brave the crowds, but at regular price, it's just ok",

The tofu and vegetarian options are a bit lacking, but the food is pretty good overall. The nachos have been my favorite item, followed by the standard burrito. The $5 special available late at night is definitely the way to go. The deals are great and you can get a huge plate of food for $5. The $7 Big Azz margaritas also make Mad Mex a worthwhile place to visit. The staff is always friendly.",

If you're a fan of the creative, delicious twist Mad Mex has given to Mexican cuisine over the years, you can't go wrong with a visit to any of the restaurants in my opinion. You have to try one of the special drink and/or food items which they have created for their Plataversary celebration this month. We had the special margarita, draft beer, and the enormous burrito which are on their special menu. The Gobblerito they offer for at least a few more weeks is a treasure as well.",

When my friends and I come here, Jersey Chips (waffle fries), Nachos Grande, any of their quesadillas, and the Mad Mex Burrito or Wing-O-Rito Burrito are the most popular choices. As for wings, I'd get the Southwestern or San Francisco wings.   ** Korean BBQ is now available for quesadillas, wings, and burritos!! ** I've tried the korean bbq wings and it's not what you'd expect to be real korean bbq flavor - pretty sweet and not as spicy. The sesame seeds are a nice touch. It comes with bean sprouts as well but I don't think it really adds to the flavor because unless you go out of your way to eat them with the wings itself, they're kinda just there for the visual. Curious to see how they incorporated it into the quesadillas and burritos, so maybe I'll try those out next time.  The Big Azz Margaritas are also a pretty popular hit. I really like their mango and watermelon flavors. $7 after 9pm, so go get em!!  Mad Mex is in the heart of South O, so it gets pretty busy and crowded. Wouldn't recommend to come here to talk to someone for deep convos, but just to chill and hang with friends while eating good late night food.",

Mad Mex has a discounted menu after 11, unfortunately doesn't include their delicious tacos. From what I remember, their burritos and wings are half off.  Service is always hit or miss here. Kitchen closes at 1am so be mindful of that.  I think I came here right before the 1am mark so we had to order fast.   Their \"BIG AZZ\" margaritas are pretty basic and yummy with several flavors like raspberry or mango (they're $7 after 9pm!!). Wings are always a good choice. I really like their SOUTHWESTERN or SAN FRANCISCO WINGS. I feel like the Shadyside location tastes better but maybe that's just a mind thing because the vibe feels more upscale there compared to the smaller Oakland location.",

My boyfriend and I went there last night for dinner and I had ordered the shrimp taquitos (which were good) and a chicken burrito.  When our food came, the burrito was terrible. Bland rice, bland beans, dry chicken breast. I told the waitress that I didn't want my current burrito and to have her suggest something that tasted good (like the shrimp taquitos), she said there wasn't anything else like that for the burritos and suggested I get a shrimp and mushroom burrito. I said okay to that suggestion and about 10 minutes later the new burrito arrives and it's just as worse as the first one. Still dry, still bland.  When the waitress asked me if I liked it, I said not really and she was just like, \"Oh I'm sorry you don't like it,\" and walked away. Then after that, she never came by to check on us or to refill our drinks. I had to ask another server to find her so that we could get the bill and leave.  Anyways, long story short, this place is a waste of time, money and calories. Avoid at all cost.",

Seems this is a completely different type of cuisine.   First off, it's WAY too overpriced to be called Mexican food.  Second, Mexican food is simple. There are way too many ingredients and not even the right ones in the food.  Third, they do you have great vegan and vegetarian options. My girlfriend was not a fan of her quesadilla but did enjoy her teriyaki tofu appetizer (because you know ... nothing says Mexican like teriyaki!!)  Lastly, it's way too busy and loud. Hard to hear other people at your table since the table next to you is practically sitting in your lap.   Not worth the hassle of parking.   In sum, avoid this place at all costs.",

I figured lunch meat variety turkey, instant mashed potatoes, and some cheap stuffing and canned veggies. I couldn't have been more wrong.   This food is the tops. I'm completely serious.

They have a Thai Curry Burrito and the Gobblerito on the menu. Enough said.  3) It is too dark.

They were stingy with the chips, and it was depressing to have so much cheese sauce left and no (socially acceptable) way to eat it.   The service could have been better. The inside of the restaurant is pretty small and the waitresses were really strict about who could sit down. You could only sit at a table if you personally were eating food. You couldn't even sit with your friend who ordered something unless you were eating it too. Our waitress seemed like she wanted to get us out of there (or at least away from the table) as quickly as possible. I understand that the place is small and tables are precious, but they could have been more gracious about it.

Lets just say, if you're a lightweight, you'll be tapping after 1. You can either get the regular margarita or one of the flavored one. Or, you can mix two flavors together which is also really good. After 2 of the big ones, you get a very healthy buzz going on. 3 ... well, you'll have a more than healthy buzz and a ridiculous sugar rush. 4.... haven't seen it yet. The sugar usually gets to you first.  As for the food, this is great Mexican food. I usually get a burrito and piggy size it so they put double the meat in. I really don't need to get double meat because the serving sizes are enormous but after doing it the first time, I can't possibly go back. Mad Mex is one of the reasons why a lot of people get the freshman 15 and the sophomore 30. The food and drinks are soo good that you can't just say no.   There usually is quite a bit of a wait if you go for half price food but it's still worth the wait. You can hang out at the bar and grab some free nachos and salso to go with a margarita while you wait for your food.  Definitely worth hitting up.",

    "text": "I'm a middle of the road fan of Mad Mex (see my review of the Robinson location if you'd like for more details), but wanted to provide a review based on the location and ambiance of this branch of the restaurant.  Short answer, it may be the worst Mad Mex location and here's why:  The restaurant is consistently too cold, winter or summer  Dim lighting through the restaurant (not in the good ambiance sort of way) or blindingly bright where the only window is located  Super awkward seating (first you get to brush your butt past your table-neighbor's face when you sit down, then it is your turn to show you theirs when they leave!) that is too close together  Difficult to get a parking spot in the neighborhood  I hate to sound picky, but it is True that when you can't feel comfortable in an environment it is likely that you won't enjoy yourself, and that is exactly what happens to me every time I have no choice but to eat at this location. Try one of the many other locations for a better experience if you can!",

I still come back to Pittsburgh 1-2 times a year and I don't miss an opportunity to visit this fine establishment.  IMO, their spicy steak  burrito is the best in the world.  Combine this with the spicy black bean dip and several margaritas and you have recipe for a great evening.  Mad Mex runs happy hours specials on the drinks as well as discounted food late evenings.  The place can get pretty crowded for the specials, but it is well worth the time and effort.",

Situated right next to CMU and Pitt campuses, Mad Mex mainly caters to college students with HUGE and quite strong margaritas and extremely dark ambiance. The waiters even have small flashlights if you can't see the menu!  So far I've tried a burrito and an enchilada here. The burrito was folded square and is a fork-and-knife kinda burrito. It wasn't exceptionally tasty. The enchilada was better and spicy but again, not mouth-watering. The margaritas and chips and salsa combo are the winners so far.  I do love the art in here. I don't know if it's a chain thing and it's simply outsourced but I like to believe it's painted by local mural artists.",

Don't get steak anything because the \"steak\" is as tough as shoe leather, but you should be alright with chicken.  I like Kristy's sister's red velvet enchilada...which isn't red, isn't velvet and I have absolutely no idea what it has to do with someone named Kristy and her sister.  Pretty good most times, sometimes it comes out with the chicken chunks as cold as ice but they'll quickly heat it up for you.  Which indicates that the chicken is kept cold and then \"warmed\" when they smother it with sauce.  Assuming you can get it warm, it's pretty good (not great but OK) as are most of the chicken menu offerings. This is not really a Mexican restaurant for those who have lived in LA or Mexico and know what real Mexican food is but the Mad Mex concoctions are, if I may repeat, OK. Parking is tough around here.  Expect to have to walk from a few blocks away. I'm not a drinker but it seems that everybody around me gets the Big Azz margaritas and loves them.",

It's a small, pretty crowded space. And they pack 'em in! You can't squeeze through without bumping other patrons. Service is hit or miss, regardless of whether it's crowded. I've had fast and really slooww wait times for food.  The ambiance is pretty fun though. The beer selection is decent and the margaritas are fantastic. I don't think I've ever been truly disappointed or blown away by the food itself.  There's lots of different offerings but the flavors in each entree sort of melt together and don't stick out too much. Nothing to get too excited about. I've continued to come back here over the years though because it's a fun place, if you don't mind the crowds.",

Still, I can't deny that it was decent.  So, the good.  It was okay.  They actually had salads that didn't taste like they had sat in a refrigerator for several days.  Their beer selection was decent, not just the usual Dos Equis/Corona.    And the bad.  Their tortillas were crap, clearly purchased at the local mega-mart or at least tasting like it.  They really took away from my tacos.  Their taco salad was very underwhelming.  It was nice to have fresh greens, but the meat was greasy and over-seasoned.  Their guacamole is also over-seasoned, though not terrible.  The service is on the slow side, it was very crowded both times I was there, and the music is much too loud for a crowded restaurant without a dance floor.    The second time I was there, our food took at least 40 minutes.  We didn't complain because it had been slow the first time we were there, and we were enjoying ourselves.  Without any complaints from us, our server explained that our ticket had gotten lost, apologized profusely, and took our drinks and appetizer off the bill.  So, high marks for service even if it was generally slow.  Overall, the food was average, the service was okay, the atmosphere had its problems, but it was above average for the area.",

The drink specials are okay, but I personally don't think they are that good.  The \"big azz\" margaritas aren't spectacular or really even that big - an average margarita is probably about 12-16oz, depending on the place.  I don't want to pay $10 for shitty tequila?   The food is average and over priced.  Their burritos are so doughy and lack the taste you can get from even Chipotle.   From all of the big  burrito restaurants, this one needs the most work.  The decor is clever but tacky.  The servers at EVERY Mad Mex I've ever been to are rude and are just trying to get some tips out of you (which is fair, I wait tables and do the same but you can still be nice to your tables if they juts want drinks?).  The drinks are meh and the food is blah.   Comparing this place to Kaya puts it all in perspective - but Big Burrito probably won't change anything since it brings int he college kids spending their parents money.",

I definitely enjoyed the place in Oakland more than the one in Shadyside (I wrote another review for the Shadyside branch)- the place is less crowded, more intimate, and the wait staff is cooler- however, it takes a while to get your food so plan to have a couple of drinks with good company as you wait.",

I recommend the Hand Mex Tofu Wrapture ($5) and Pennsyltucky Fried Tofu appetizer ($4) for vegetarians. The Fried Tofu appetizer comes in decent servings and the tofu wrapture..I've never had anything like this before. The wrap tastes great - a really creative spin of a vegetarian Chipotle-burrito. It's completely filling, with mexican rice and tofu with pico de gallo. But what really ties the whole thing together is their wing sauce. I chose Honey Chipotle BBQ and the wrap went from crisp to complex - a mix of fresh ingredients with that subdued but detectable taste of sweet and spicy.

I have actually only eaten at this location a few times, but I have drank many more times here, and ordered a plethora of take out to the point where I think I have sampled 95% of the menu. After sampling the majority of the menu, I really can't complain. While it's hardly authentic Mexican food, the menu options are unique and typically flavorful. Portions are large enough to leave you satisfyingly full. My absolute favorite item to order is the Kristy's big sister's red velvet quesadilla (Marinated chicken, grilled zucchini, spicy spinach, pico de gallo and Jack cheese). It's (relatively) healthy And always allows for leftovers the next day. The Carnitas quesadilla (Pork braised in beer, garlic and ancho chili rolled up in a wheat tortilla with roasted green chilis and served with slaw, pico de gallo and Jack cheese) is another stellar option and packs a bit more of a punch when it comes to the spiciness of the dish. As weird as it may sound, the coleslaw actually tastes really good when put inside the quesadilla (don't judge lol). The thai curry burrito (grilled steak, chicken, shrimp, tofu or portobello, with toasted peanuts, pineapple and Thai curry sauce. Topped with bean sprouts. Sweet-n-sour slaw) is another interesting choice I'd recommend and it packs a punch flavor wise as well. The margaritas are amazing, as fellow Yelpers have already detailed. While it may not be the most authentic or best-tasting Mexican in Pittsburgh, it's still an A-OK option in my book!",

Nevertheless, anytime I can get a consistently decent carnitas burrito with jalepeno cornbread and slaw, I'll take it.  I've been to 4-5 different locations in the burgh and this is definitely the smallest.

    "text": "Mad Mex gets super crowded all the time for a reason.  Their \"Big Azz\" margaritas are nothing particularly special, but will knock you on your ass. Factor in their two-a-day happy hours featuring $7 margaritas and you're in for some economical, pleasant drinking.  Food is half-off after 11, so if you're getting drunk munchies after imbibing on one (or three) margaritas at night you're in luck. It's pretty good too, they offer some creative dishes that, while blatantly inauthentic, satisfy. Portions are so big that even with drunk munchies I can only finish 3/4 of my meal.  The service is super patient and quick as well. Even when the place is packed with a bunch of drunk people servers never get snappy. Every time I've been hammered there a waiter has always politely asked me to move, and has put up with my significantly delayed reaction time.  The major con of Mad Mex is how loud and tiny it is. If you're there to drink at the bar there's very little standing room. If you're there to eat at a table expect to be bumping elbows with the person next to you. Even when it's not too crowded the restaurant is inexplicably loud, so don't bring a date here (unless you don't really want to hear what she's talking about, in which case do so as I have in the past).  In summary: go here during off hours for good food to avoid the crowds or during happy hours when you'll be too drunk to care about the crowds. Also, for anyone trying to get in using a fake, they're one of the stricter bars in Oakland so be careful.",

In the past, I've been given trouble for not having my entire party present upon seating time (which I'll give to them since other restaurants do it too, I just find it annoying). I've also been told to wait at the bar for a table open up, only to be told that I had to close out my tab at the bar before they would let me occupy a table.   Most recently, I arrived during happy hour and was told that they were clearing a table for my party, with an estimated wait time of five minutes. About 25 minutes later we were finally seated. We immediately put our order in, and let our server know that we only had an hour as we were trying to make a movie in the south side. To this she said \"I'll try my best, but you did come during happy hour and we're busy...\"  I keep foolishly coming back because the location is convenient for me, but I would suggest eating elsewhere in Oakland. Or, if you insist on eating at Mad Mex, try one of their other 50 locations.",

I really enjoyed a mix of the cilantro lime dressing that came with the salad and the chipotle aioli sauce that came with the torta. My friend got a burrito and cleaned his plate. Plus, we ordered past 10pm, so we ended up getting half off our food order!  I also got a margarita on the rocks, which was pretty good. A solid margarita. I liked that they had a variety of drink choices. (Lots of choices for people, like me, who aren't beer fans.) Thinking of trying their sangria margarita next time...  The service was standard. The ambiance was ok. I couldn't hear the people across from me that well because of the noise/music level, but we just had to talk a little louder than usual. I'm basically giving this place five stars because the food was excellent (and everything on the menu looked pretty good); plus, the drinks were good (with lots of drink options). Oh, and it's open for food till later in the night! (There don't seem to be that many other places to go to past 10pm.) I would definitely go back, especially if it's a late night dinner.",

    "text": "We lived right around the corner from this place... SO DANGEROUS. With a half-off late night menu (11pm-1am) which includes pretty much everything minus the tacos and a couple other more obscure items, when our late night munchies came grumbling, this place usually took precedence.   We are big fans of the Pick-A-Dippa. We usually get the pico (usually very fresh and juicy), guac (consistently delicious and chunky), and the pineapple habanero which seems to vary depending on the season/produce. Sometimes it's straight spicy, sometimes it's a perfect balance of sweet pineapple and a spice that builds on the tongue. The color is usually a good indication of the heat (darker = spicier, yellower = sweeter). We always make sure to order a side of sour cream (which they usually don't charge for) to pair with the pineapple habanero... cuts the heat enough so I can enjoy it.   My boyfriend LOVES the wings. Mild San Francisco with blue cheese. He's also a huge fish taco fan and these were some of his favorite in Pittsburgh. I love the house salad with the lime-cilantro vinaigrette (one of the best dressings in Pittsburgh) and the tofu isn't bad either... tofu tacos = yum. Also developed a liking for their quesadillas... I'd usually order one with just cheese, grilled onions and peppers, and corn. Depending on the cook that day, it could be a let-down or it could be amazing. Can't beat the waffle fries which are perfectly crispy or, heaven forbid I forget to mention... the Big Azz Margaritas. I don't like the fact that you can taste the basic pre-mixed margarita underneath all of the fruit flavors, but you can't beat the alcohol content or the size. Be prepared for a very fuzzy, buzzy, brain-freeze.   Oakland is okay for college standards (food and service varies greatly depending on when you go), but go to the Shady Side location if you want the best Mad Mex has to offer.",

    "text": "Mad Mex will always have a special place in my heart, and my stomach. And probably my liver too. I remember coming here with friends on my 21st birthday, and we all got big azz margaritas. And then some more margaritas. And then some more. And then it got hazy. Same with my senior year in college, when we would come for happy hour. Hazy as well. Given the size and tastiness of the margaritas and the great beer selection, you can see why there's a bit of haziness.  Anyways, I definitely think that out of all the Big Burrito restaurants, Mad Mex is my favorite. The half-price menu at this location makes the deal even sweeter. My buddies and I would usually go to Fuel & Fuddle for half-price, but if we ever wanted to mix it up, we would make the trek to Mad Mex, for some wings or burritos. My favorite items are the Large San Francisco wings with bleu cheese, nachos grande, and the black bean dip. Seriously, that black bean dip is pretty epic, and I've found that nary another restaurant in the country has a black bean dip that good. Also, if you haven't tried the blue cornbread, you should. Incredibly moist, and did I mention it's blue? Overall, the prices are great too, and if all else fails, you can't go wrong with a simple bottomless chips and salsa order either. They're also pretty good at making vegan and vegetarian versions of most of the dishes on the menu, which helps when you've got an herbivore in your group.  I do wish that it wasn't so crowded on the weekends, and to be fair, Mad Mex doesn't really serve authentic Mexican food, or even Tex-Mex for that matter. As long as you can get over these two facts, Mad Mex is an awesome place to have a big azz margarita, and grab some Tex-Mex-ish American bar food. Also, note that the Shadyside location does NOT have late night food specials like the Oakland location.  Nonetheless, I came back not too long ago, and I was glad to see that not much had changed. I'll still never get used to day drinking at Mad Mex. Since it's so dark inside, once you leave the restaurant, the sunlight will almost blind you, and people will think you're more intoxicated than you actually are, even though it's just the burst of light that's disorienting you. And the booze.   As I'll leave you to your Yelp Review reading, Mad Mex is an awesome bar to booze and grab some good food with friends, with a few small flaws here and there. I suggest you look past those flaws and just love it for what it is.",

Asides for the wait, I've never had a bad experience here.  I'm a bit of a picky eater at times, but love this place because they let me mix and match my soft tacos.  Usually end up getting one chicken, one steak, one ground beef with all the fixings, albeit variations of the traditional.  I opt for the soy cheese and tofu sour cream.  Gotta have me a piece of the blue cornbread as well.  Not sure what they do with it, but that ooey-gooey part is what I crave.  I'm sure people look at me and think 'what a pig' because of all the food I have in front of me.  If the shoe fits, I'm a pig.  Nothing wrong with chowing down on some of the best Mexican food I've ever had the chance to explore.  Two suggestions for y'all:  1. Opt for your margaritas on the rocks.  The frozen ones do one hell of a job on you when you get brain freeze.  2.  Pay attention to the indicators for the bathroom.  Don't be a goof like me and go into the wrong bathroom on multiply occasions....I still don't think I can get that one right.",

Really nothing special about it. It's pretty standard Americanized Mexican food.... Not very authentic. Not terrible. Not great. In fact, the best thing on the menu is definitely the chicken wings, which aren't even remotely Mexican. But that said, they have really good buffalo wings.

The $7 big azz margs are also fun, but I stick to the 12 oz that'll do the job well enough for $3 too. I'm not a fan of the taste of tequila so I stick with the original lime on the rocks (it masks the taste well).  One thing I wish that I knew earlier is that \"Jersey Chips\" are waffle fries.

It can be loud from time to time, but seating is always quite intimate so you can hear whomever you are with.
