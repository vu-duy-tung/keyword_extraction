After having one glass of wine, a young worker talked to me very disrespectfully and told me I cannot handle my liquor after simply requesting to use the elevator to get to the bottom floor. He threatened to call the police because I didn't want to walk down the stairs as he demanded. My date was waiting for me on the bottom floor, as I went to the upper level to close my tab. I would not suggest this establishment for anyone's patronage. Go elsewhere.",

Even though we were seated immediately in a fabulous booth, the waits for everything were l-o-n-g.  Loved the vibe and our meals were good.    Started with fried pickle chips - one of our favs.  Very good!  Three of us had Spicy Pork Balls and although good, no one thought they were spicy - Friend had the traditional Beef Balls and said that they were very good.  They also went with the Risotto and gave it two thumbs up!  Parm/herb fries were tasty and Hubs enjoyed the mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy with his balls.  And everything is served in cute bowls of varying sizes.  Would've liked to try dessert, but too slow to chance it.  Maybe next time!",

The buffalo chicken balls appetizer was very very hot- too spicy for me. Definitely not a traditional buffalo wing flavor- this one is buffalo kicked up 3 notches. The salads are good but a little pricey. Nice beer & hard cider selection!",

On top of that...tarter tots with fried egg with cheese curd and chicken gravy, let's just say it was amazing! The meatballs are huge and freshly made. I didn't really care for the cheese curd on my poutine. I learned while in Pittsburgh, they put French fries or some sort of potato form in anything. I was there for a conferee and I recommended some people to Check this place out. They absolutely loved it as well. Customer service was great and knowledgeable about the food. The atmosphere makes you feel at home and it's not fancy at all. Price is great for what you are getting!",

I'll admit I haven't yet been to the second floor, but the other two are so good I'm not even mad.  The meatballs from Emporio are to die for- in all of the different combinations and serving styles. One of my family members has a severe gluten allergy and has eaten the items they list as gluten free here many times without any contamination issues. The tomato risotto is one of those gluten free items and it is soo cheesy and amazing... totally shareable portion too.  The rooftop bar Il Tetto has a good atmosphere, big TVs, large drink selection, and really good snacks/appetizers. Sienna Mercato uses the NoWait app, which makes it easy to head upstairs for a drink or two while you wait for your table to ready!  Will be back again soon, hopefully to try the pizza next.",

We had dinner at the Mezzo (2nd floor) and ordered the calamari-- crisp, not the slightest bit chewy, with an herb-infused/caper aioli, olives-- the perfect amount of spice, the bread basket-- our waitress was really knowledgable and explained the variety of breads and spreads in detail, mesculun salad-- fresh, the pesto vinaigrette was to die for, and the quattro formaggi pizza-- the pickled tomato made for a unique sweet and acidic twist. We also ordered the spaghetti alla Vangole, but I was unable to give it a try, as I was absolutely stuffed already.  The menu is set up so that your table and order an assortment of dishes, the waitstaff will distribute plates/ appropriate serving ware, and everyone can sample the delectables.  I can't wait to bring my parents to Il Tetto (and hopefully follow the beers with a pizza downstairs...)",

What is really nice is that you are able to have half portions of the pasta, which is still plenty for one person. I had the seafood risotto and it was great! Another thing is that with a party of 9, they were very accommodating.   The only real downside was that this place doesn't take reservations. The longer wait for the food was understandable due to it being dinner time on a Friday and also the fact that there were 9 in our party. In addition, they also allowed us all to split the checks, which is rare for many establishments for large parties. Our waitress was really nice as well!

    "text": "I paid Mezzo, the middle level of Sienna Mercato, a visit this past weekend, when my friends and I were downtown to see the PGH Opera at the Benedum.  Given that Mezzo just opened a month or so ago, that it made the Post Gazette's most recent list of notable new restaurants, and that I greatly enjoyed my experience at Emporio downstairs, I was eager to try this trendy new addition to the Cultural District dining scene.  We started off with an order of the bruschetta del giorno, which had the following toppings the day of our visit: white bean paste, roasted red peppers, and anchovies.  While the anchovies added a welcome savory note to the bruschetta, overall, I found it rather bland in flavor (my friends concurred).  Fortunately, the food quality went up from there.  We ordered two pizzas to share between the three of us: the margherita for something more traditional, and the pistachio-prosciutto, which came with roasted crimini mushrooms, fennel pollen, and vinagrette-tossed arugula, for something more avant-garde.  The latter pie had a very interesting, complex, and fragrant flavor profile, and was quite nutty due to the pistachio butter that acted as a sauce--almost overly so.  I found it similar in composition to the fig-goat cheese pizza offered at The Porch in Oakland, which I prefer due to its bolder flavor and sweet-savory balance.  The margherita was my surprise favorite--I found it the best version of this pie that I've tried in PGH to date, due to its savory, well-seasoned sauce, fresh mozzarella, and its significant but not overwhelming infusion of basil.  The crust of both pies was more pan-style than thin, and was crispy and substantial.  The bocce cookies provided with the check were also chocolatey, gooey, and delicious, and were a nice touch.  Aside from the food, we really enjoyed the atmosphere, which, as others have mentioned, is a bit more refined than Emporio (I can't speak for Il Tetto, since I haven't visited yet), but carries through the farmhouse theme.  Even the tunes, an eclectic mix of upbeat songs from the 70's and 80's, added to it.  As for the service, it was impeccable--the best I've encountered to date in a restaurant of this caliber to date. Our waiter, Cory, was very knowledgeable about the food, as well as appropriate wines to pair with it.  Someone even came over and refolded my friends' napkins while they were in the bathroom--wow!  Overall, I'd recommend Mezzo for a high-quality, casual, and reasonably-priced dinner downtown.  ***Note: Please also see my separate review for Emporio, for which this review is listed as an update.***",

As a former bar manger I found this discretion odd, especially considering my intake of only 3 beers during the 4 hours of a Pittsburg Pirates game.    I was legally able to navigate a motor vehicle, but I was unable to eat a bowl spaghetti at this restaurant.    I asked to speak to the manager and asked why we would not be served.  Blame was passed to the server who passed it back to the manager who had zero explanation.  Zero.     The only thing that makes any sense to us was that they close at midnight and we showed up at 11.    If you don't want to serve food past a certain point then don't, but don't insult the people who have decided to dine at your establishment.   I am personally embarrassed and completely disappointed in how the server and his manager handled the situation.   As a business owner myself I feel bad for the owner of this business that has enlisted these people to take care of his business.",

I had gone with some out of town vegetarian friends knowing that their menu was full of veggie-goodness.  I was there more for the meat.    I started with an Italian cream soda in blueberry that had a bit of an odd flavor to it.  It might have been the cream, it might have been the syrup, not really sure, but it was just a bit off.   Then I had the turkey ball with the pesto and the spicy pork with arrabiatta.  Now, I like spicy things - I am generally a 7 on an Asian scale of spicy, but this ball and sauce literally made my nose run.  Hot, just for the sake of hot, is never appealing.  The pesto left a lot to be desired as well.  And the turkey ball was dry and rather flavorless.  I always buy turkey meatballs at Whole Foods which are delicious and these did not at all compare.  I also order the beans and greens which were good, but super soupy and kind of should have been served with a spoon.   The friends that ate the veggie balls said it was really just a white bean ball and rather flavorless.    If you are a meatball place, you should make meatballs - the best meatballs ever.  These were not nearly as good as my mom's or Whole Foods which was disappointing.",

    "text": "Amazing beer garden, when weather permits they can open the rooftop and let the sun it. It is so beautiful, drink prices are a tad expensive, but happy hour in their atrium on the 3rd floor is well worth it the extra dollar or two for a cocktail out of sheer beauty. My only complaint is the restaurant is 3 floors, physically not a problem since they have elevators, it's that they have kitchens on separate floors, and their POS (credit card system) is either not connected between the floors, or their insurance rates is too expensive to have their staff running up and down flights of stairs with trays of food/drinks every shift. So while i enjoyed my drinks in the beer garden on the third floor, I had to close out my tab upstairs, then call the restaurant I was already at, put in a To-Go order. Take the elevator downstairs, pay at the hostess stand separately for my To-Go order, then wait for my food in the waiting area. (I ordered truffle fries so I was only waiting for two minutes.)  My only critique is that I completely understand having different menus depending on which floor you are seated in. I just would have liked to be able to order my fries (only offered on the first floor) while I was closing out my tab in their beer garden on the third floor, and grab it on my way out. It would have saved me from having to pay twice in one establishment, and also save my party a few minutes while we were trying to leave.",

    "text": "TL;DR  Food 6/10    Service 2/10  Sienna Mercato has been on my list of places to try for quite some time, and finally I had the chance. My family and I visited after a hot day in the city (Picklesburgh). My boys (ages 4 and 6) adore meatballs, so Emporio was definitely the place for us. We were seated quickly, and someone who identified themselves as \"the person who was not serving us, but would be refilling our water\" filled our glasses and left a bit of additional water at the table. Thank goodness that little bit of extra water was left for us, because our water was never refilled.  Our server dropped off menus about 10 minutes later - we had wanted to order an appetizer but did not have the opportunity at this time. Maybe another 15 minutes passed before our server came back to take our order. We were told by the woman \"who would be refilling our water\" that the server would explain the meatball of the day to us. He didn't - we had to ask about it. At this time we ordered an appetizer along with our meals. I specifically stated that we wanted it was an appetizer. We didn't wait long at all for our food, and wouldn't you know the appetizer came out at the same time the entrees were delivered by the food runner. This is a particular pet peeve of mine.  I had the classic beef meatball panini with spinach almond pesto - this was quite good. Both my kids had meatball sliders (also good), and my husband had a panini with government cheese. We all found the government cheese to be INCREDIBLY salty.  Our server did not return to our table again to check on us until we were completely finished, and at that point we simply requested the check. I was hoping to see the \"person who was not serving us, but would be refilling our water\" because we were all fresh out of water, but she never returned.  I'd go back for pretty decent food if the service was stellar, but that was not the case in my experience.",

    "text": "So, I want to give this 5 stars because it was a cool atmosphere with a great beer selection but...it just didn't deserve it.  Happened to stop in right when it opened on a Saturday--a bit after 11. They have their normal menu (no brunch or anything, which is fine with me).  Sat at the bar. Someone immediately brought us water and let us know that the bartender would be with us shortly...which she wasn't.  I don't know that it was her fault as she was prepping stuff and it's not clear that anyone told her we were there, so I'm fine with that, but still worth noting here, I guess.  Great draft beer selection and prices were not bad for a nicer restaurant; for example, a KY bourbon barrel IPA was 7.50, which is a lot, I know, BUT a few doors down (Sharp Edge or whatever it is called), that same beer is ridiculously overpriced at 10.50.  ANyway, great beer selection and friendly and informative bartender.  Got the rocket salad which was basic but good--mostly tons of arugula with some slivered almonds, three tomato wedges (not good tomatoes but it's not tomato season, but not their fault) and maybe 3 little balls of housemade mozz.  Got the Italian salad dressing and it was really good.  Ordered one turkey meatball with the salad, bc it was 2.50 (salad was $6) and I wanted to try it.  DELICIOUS!  so, wasn't blown away by the salad but liked that it was a lot of arugula and only $6 and overall well-executed.  and the meatball was great.  also ordered the 3 meatballs (original) in a grinder with the pork bolognase and provolone cheese.  It was a big sandwich--def enough to share (though I guess it all depends how much you eat).  good roll. bolognase was good but, for me, had too many diced carrots in there that were still on the too crunchy side.  others may like this...though I think even if you want that many carrots, they should have been softer. but the real issue with this, and the reason for the 3 stars, is because the meatballs were not really warm. I mean, they were at best room temp.  AT BEST. I know that it was early in the day and that they were taken out of the fridge and whatever else, but the place wasn't crowded, the sub didn't come out quickly and hello, take a few more minutes to make sure the food is warm.  a cold meatball is not good.  it just is sort of mushy and blah.    and this wasn't just my experience...a few minutes later the guy near me (he ordered 4 meatballs--2 pork and 2 original) sent his back with the same complaint, so hopefully the kitchen got its act together after that?  So...just not really sure what was going on.  you're a meatball spot.  that's your thing.  you have got to have the meatballs not only delicious but properly heated.    I would go back when in town, perhaps, because the turkey meatball was spot on and delicious, but was pretty disappointed with the others.",

I don't like eating alone when traveling, but Lindsey behind the bar was super friendly and made me feel at home. I was disappointed to find out the menu consists of mostly just soup, salad, and meatballs, but that was a rash judgment!   Maybe 30 taps had local and far away beers, with perhaps half of them IPAs, which is OK by me. I settled on a local brew, the Fatheads Head Hunter IPA, 7.5%, $7.50, which was pretty darn good.  I had the meatball grinder with Grandmas traditional beef balls, Sunday sauce (marinara) and provolone, and it may have been the best meatball sub I've ever had. Bread was hot, crusty and substantial, and stood up to the marinara. Balls were huge, racket ball size, and I found I was better off cutting them in half and rearranging on the bun.  Great place, and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

This would be a great place to join a group of friends, drink a little beer and watch a game on the numerous TVs.  One end is open to Penn Ave.  I then moved to the middle level where I had a good red wine and a very good bacon and clam pizza.  I like this level. I really liked the pizza.   And, sadly, I'm too full to check out the first level. I'll save that for my next trip.   All in all, it's now in my top 5 in Pittsburgh.",

Well the 1st of three Emporio has recently opened and I was totally impressed with the meatball menu and the draft beer selection. It was hard to pick from the menu so I ordered a few things. The meatballs were OUTSTANDING!   The second concept of this trifecta is Pork based and it is my understanding that they will be butchering and preparing many wonderful Pork dishes. This is supposed to happen sometime around March 1st.   The crowning event will open sometime late spring, and will be an Italian Beer Garden.  I think someone said it would have a variety of food selections and of course a great draft beer line up!  In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger...\"I'll be back\"",

We had a reservation for 5 pm; however for the first 30 minutes of our meal we had essentially the entire place to ourselves. We had a seat right against the window and it was a beautiful location.   We started with the small charcuterie plate and the small artisanal cheese platter. I highly suggest getting both of these together. We split this appetizer between the two of us, but it could provide a little taste for up to four people. We paired this with a glass of primitivo which apparently is made from the same grape as the red zinfandel. This wine was great once it had some time to breathe.   For dinner we split the Tartufo pizza which has ricotta, fontina, roasted mushrooms, truffle, parmesean, farm egg, and chives. This pizza was so delicious. It is split into 6 pieces and we almost finished the whole thing between the two of us. The mushrooms are very meaty and the hint of truffle really adds another level to this pizza. Unfortunately, we were unable to have dessert because we had a show to catch; but our server gave us complimentary coconut cookies to go.  Our service was superb. The server really knew how to sell the menu and create combinations that customers will enjoy. He was very attentive but not too overwhelming. In addition, they didn't start our pizza until after our appetizer was finished which was wonderful. the pizza was fresh from the oven! Our entire experience came in at $65 which was a great value. I think two appetizers, dinner, and wine for that price is worth it.   I can't wait to come back sometime soon and try their other cheese plate!!",

Whoever was walking by was happy to take a plate away or ask if we needed anything. Oh yeah, the food was awesome! I can't wait to go back and try more stuff. My wife and I had two small plates, the crab potato salad and the grilled octopus. Both were delicious. We've never had octopus before but it was so good! We also got the chefs selection of cheese and meats and breads and everything was superb! Had the orange crush drink and that was awesome too! Don't hesitate to go somewhere with great food, a great atmosphere and a wonderful friendly staff!!",

Gosh, anything seemed better than the actual eateries in the Westin!  Sienna Mercato is divided into 2 sections:  The main level is a meatball joint and the line-up outside, for most evenings, is for the rooftop restaurant which features a more traditional, upscale Italian fare.    Although I wouldn't order the Veg Meatballs again, they were well seasoned, but the texture was mushy (from the white beans), I liked the Mac 'n Cheese that came with them, Marinara was ok, and I loved the concept!  Not only were prices decent, but you could mix and match the kind of meatballs - or even meatless - in various different plates, sauces, & even add sides if you want.  They also had a cheap dessert menu which consisted of a few items for $5.  I would NEVER see a $5 dessert in Toronto, so that was a treat.  Would definitely go back to try the other meatballs, sauces, sides, & of course, the numerous beers that they offer!",

There are 4 different types of meatballs on the regular menu, plus a meatball of the month. You can get meatballs as sliders, grinders, paninis or just in a bowl with one of their many sauces.  I had 3 sliders and was able to try three different meatball/sauce combinations. Everything was delicious. I can't wait to go back here again to try new combinations. I absolutely loved the spicy pork with the parmesan cream sauce. I originally just ordered 2 sliders since we were splitting an order of poutine. Everything came out quickly, and it wasn't much longer when I decided to order a third slider. I want to order one of the other sandwiches sometime, but the idea of getting multiple meatball types and sauces is too good to resist so I might stick with the sliders.  We went on a Saturday for lunch around 1pm and it wasn't very crowded. I'm sure it would be busier if there was a game going on, but it was nice to be seated right away. We didn't get alcohol, but they had a good looking drink menu. Everything was really affordable and for how full I was after lunch, it was a great deal.",

We almost always get a charcuterie tray and a few flatbreads to share and have never been disappointed.  One thing that is disappointing is that you can't order drinks from the rooftop bar, so the selection is lacking.

Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time for work we ran in there starving after hearing great reviews. We couldn't even make it to the second floor so we stuck to meatballs and boy we're we not disappointed   Food: my coworker and I got fried pickles and a salad to start. I'm a lover of fried pickles and boy was I not let down by taste and portion size - let's top it off with their bacon ranch dipping sauce. I then got the saucy classic balls with their crack sauce (ranch and buffalo mixed together) over mashed potatoes. I think I saw heaven for a split second. My coworker got the saucy chicken balls with the spicy sauce over Brussels. She's not a huge meat eater but she consumed the whole thing in seconds, i'd say that's a good sign.   Service: For how busy this restaurant was I'd say service was pretty fast.   Atmosphere: the main floor was definitely pretty loud since there was a game going on.   I'd definitely go back there just to try out the second floor pasta and see the third floor rooftop. Go Pittsburgh Go!",

The manager finally dropped it off. Root beer float is made with bottled Boylan root beer so thankfully it was good.   I went with saucey balls with spinach almond pesto & mashed potatoes. My meal was initially brought out with no potatoes. We waited awhile again for our server to fix the problem & finally asked a host who walked by.   My bf ordered saucey balls with sauce over Mac & cheese. Thankfully the food was good & filling.  We waited forever again for our server to get boxes & the check.

Every floor is a different restaurant, so it's basically a bunch of interesting and hip places all packed into one location! I have dined at Emporio (ground floor) twice and have snagged a drink at Il Tetto (rooftop bar) a handful of times. I'm looking forward to trying the pizza at Mezzo (middle floor) soon!  Emporio's main focus is meatballs. It sounds strange, but these are not your average meatballs. They really are pretty good; I like to get mine in panini form with gouda cheese on top. I wouldn't say I'm absolutely rushing back to Emporio any time soon for the food, but I think it's a very cool atmosphere and a trendy place to take out of town guests. On the other hand, I really love the rooftop bar at Il Tetto. It honestly could not be in a better location. In the summer they open up the glass roof and you see the Steel building and Highmark building looming right above you. You're really right in the action here, and it's no wonder that it's always packed. Il Tetto is such a neat place to experience the city of Pittsburgh with a drink in hand.",

Though I will say I wish the portions were larger considering the cost. The 4 balls were $12...it would have been another $4 for a pasta and lets remember this is lunch! I wasn't up for a $20 lunch even though I still spent $15 with the tip. I think you have to look at all factors when giving a review.

I stopped in for happy hour on a Tuesday and we had no trouble getting a table near the bar right away. They run some happy hour specials including half-priced drafts and $5 wines.  My friends and I ordered some appetizers for the table to go along with our drinks. The pepperoni fritters were delicious little balls of gooey cheese with a crispy outer layer and marinara sauce for dipping. I didn't really get the pepperoni (I'm assuming it was in with the cheese maybe?) but they were tasty. The buffalo friend chicken balls were also very good (basically a buffalo chicken meatball), with just the right amount of spice and a really great blue cheese celery slaw. The last item we ordered was poutine. We opted for tots and the mushroom gravy. The tots were crispy and really good along with the melted cheese curds and savory gravy. I washed this all down with a Bell's Two-Hearted.  I'll have to go back for a full dinner sometime, but it's definitely a great happy hour option for some drinks and bites to share!",

It's enclosed under a glass rooftop in the cold months, which feels pretty magical. The cocktails up there are very good with great presentation.  More recently I've tried the downstairs Emporio and was equally pleased. You can make pretty much any combination of meatballs and sides, sandwiches, pasta you can dream up here which is quite fun but I'll admit it can be hard to for an indecisive person like me to make a final choice. I choose the vegetarian meatball slider with arrabiata sauce some of their nicely steamed parmasean broccoli and liked everything, especially the spicy red sauce. My friends tried a whole variety ranging from the traditional beef meatball on a panini, mac and cheese, salad, risotto and everyone agree the food was yummy! You really can't go wrong here. And we thought the service was good too, friendly and good suggestions.  Next, I'll have to try Mezzo.",

I've only been for drinks, so I can't rate the gluten friendliness --but I'm excited to go again. If you're looking for a fun atmosphere for late night drinks, I highly recommend it!",

However, something has changed and the quality has gone down in the last 2-3 months. During my last visit the meatballs seemed bigger, but the flavor wasn't better. The sauce that I usually order was the fresh tasting pesto. Now they have changed It to some sort of warm, cheesy mess. Their beer selection is still good, so if you are hitting them up for happy hour then you'll still be happy.",

    "text": "Before dragging my husband to the Home & Garden show at the Convention Center today, I thought having a tasty lunch beforehand might put him in a better mood. After hearing about the new Sienna Mercato Emporio, I knew that we had to check it out.  I don't often dish out 5 star reviews for restaurants, particularly after the first try. However, the food here was AMAZING!!! Between my husband and me, I was able to try two meatballs (Classic Beef and Spicy Pork), three sauces (Creamy Parmesan, Mushroom Gravy, and Tzatziki), and two sides (Penne and Mac & Cheese). Everything was absolutely incredible! I could pour the Creamy Parmesan sauce on almost any food, and the Tzatziki sauce was a perfect combination with the Spicy Pork meatball.  In addition to incredible food, the service was very good, and the decor was modern and trendy. I cannot wait for the 2nd and 3rd floors of Sienna Mercato to open, Mezzo (pizza and wine) and Il Tetto (rooftop beer garden). I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "We decided to dine at Emporio a few weeks ago. I think that I really just picked the wrong thing to have here unfortunately...but I will agree with my coworker who recommended this place - get the sliders so you can try a few different things!! I like to eat, and two plus shared fries were plenty for me.   My husband's traditional beef meatballs with marinara were good, but I didn't even finish my two sliders. My coworker had recommended the tzatziki sauce with a turkey meatball so that's what I went for! The tzatziki was not like the traditional ones I am used to, and was actually kind of sour and thin with an extreme dill taste and large thin slices of cucumber. Not for me. I also had a beef meatball with pork bolognese which was pretty good. (I will say that I don't particularly like that they give you cheese on the side and don't heat it onto the slider for you if you request it. It just resulted in a cold piece of cheese on my meatball.) My husband did not like this slider and said that it tasted like pumpkin to him (?)  I will say this. The fries were FANTASTIC! I added some extra malt vinegar to the malt vinegar aioli as the aioli didn't have quite enough bite for me.  The last note I'll make I'm not quite sure how to say - there wasn't enough \"sauce to ball\" ratio. I would've preferred the meatball smashed with more sauce or even a side of sauce. It just wasn't enough to go with the entire thing.",

Service was a bit slow, but they were pretty busy. We had the fruitti di mare pasta which was delicious and I wish we had ordered more of that. However, everything else we ordered was a miss. The pizza we ordered, which came with sausage and peppers, was really skimpy on the toppings and the sauce was overpoweringly sweet. We also had the pork chop which was overcooked and bland. Lastly we also tried a risotto that had a very strange odor - my friend could barely eat more than two bites. Luckily, they offered her something else and took it off the bill, which I appreciated. Overall I probably won't be back to visit unless it's to try the meatball restaurant or the rooftop bar.",

Even on a week day, there was a 30+ minute wait for a table, however, we were perfectly fine scoring two seats at the bar. We ordered drinks and were able to order some \"saucy balls\" as an appetizer.  The vibe at the bar has a very luxurious feel, and the drink menu is extensive. Lots of after-work, happy hour people. I also only was able to stay at the bar on the bottom level, I did not venture to the upstairs.  For the happy hour crowd, I would say the bar was a little understaffed. I am not sure if there was an event going on that time, or if they are usually this busy on a week night, but they could have used at least one more person behind the bar. I thought the food was delicious and quick to come out. I also ordered the cheese and olive plate, which was perfect with my cab sauv. Highly recommend for after-work dinner or drinks!",

    "text": "What a great experience. Went to check out the new Emporio before going to the car how this weekend.  Walking into the place, whoever did the branding and the design of the interior absolutely deserve a high-five. Just a great feel with the rustic wood, exposed metal.  We had a party of 9 and the Host, Ryan, did a great job of accommodating us and making sure that we knew he was on top of things. The other hostess was helpful as well, pointing out some of her favorites and making recommendations. (She was right, the Ricotta Donuts were the perfect finish to the meal) Liked the simple menu on a clipboard idea. Very nice clean execution. The menu it self is very simple, 4 kinds of balls and a handful of sauces. The only problem is it creates so many combinations of flavors, what to try first. We went with Cheesy Bread (that day'special), Fried Buffalo Chicken Balls and Crab Stuffed Mushrooms.  The Cheesy Bread was light and crispy, not too much cheese to overwhelm the herbs and pepper flakes. The Buffalo Chicken Balls were something totally different, just the right amount of fruity heat and a mix of textures (Crispy outside, juicy and tender in) The crab stuffed mushrooms were different from the usual as well. A touch of citrus flavor left us wondering if there was such a thing as \"fresh crab\" as opposed to the canned stuff we are all used to.  For the main course, we just grabbed a couple of each ball and 5 sauces to dip them in, figuring that was the only way to satisfy our need to try everything that we had been smelling. We were not disappointed by anything we ate. The biggest hit had to be the Bolognese Sauce. Chunky and thick, though the taste was lighter than you would imagine and the touch of cinnamon at the finish really complemented the balls. The added plus of dining this way, was that instead of being consumed by the food in front of us, we were constantly passing plates of meatballs and recommending sauces with a \"you've gotta try this\" thrown in here and there, making for a very communal dining  experience.  Overall, a great dining experience (the servers were helpful, friendly and pleasant.) the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great.",

Their pork bolognese has a hint of sweet spice to it, so heads up of you prefer a more acidic red sauce.  Their mushroom gravy has a hint of nostalgia for grandma's beef stroganoff and the buffalo balls are can't miss.  It does not get more stars due to the shoddy service by their serving staff. The best service we have gotten was seated at the bar. Each time we have table service, orders are wrong, drinks are never refilled or are forgotten about. During one trip, the server took my boyfriend's food and drink order first (big no-no, ladies first!) and then walked away from the table!  She never even got mine. She returned later with my boyfriend's beer, and we had to informer that she never took my order. Needless to say, my boyfriend's food showed up 15 minutes before mine. If they fix their serving staff, it could easily be one of the best casual dining experiences in Pittsburgh.",

We headed up to the Beer Garden on the third floor.  This was the one positive aspect of our experience.  The Beer Garden is a cool atmosphere, good selection of draft beers and wines.  After waiting nearly THREE hours we were texted that our table was ready.  We headed downstairs to wait, and one of the guys in our party  stepped out to smoke.  As he came back in he bumped the door and the host called a security guard over.  The host claimed he slammed the door, and they would not allow him back in to eat dinner with us.  This was not a young drunk 21 year old, but a middle aged father of three that had 4 beers in the \"Beer Garden.\"  This is completely uncalled for and ridiculous after we waited for three hours.  Six of us ended up eating on the second floor.  Where the service was not good, the selection of drafts is minimal, and the food is average at best.  I had a traditional pizza, which was terrible.  The pizza sauce tastes store bought and the crust was bland and not very soft.  My husband had the half-chicken dinner dish which was tasty, but not worth waiting three hours for.  This was mostly likely our first and last time there.  My suggestion is go there early have a few drinks in the Beer Garden and then go somewhere else to get yourself a good meal.",

    "text": "My friends and I were there a few weeks ago because we were intrigued by the meatballs concept.  The inside of Emporio(the first floor) was modern and fairly rustic at the same time.  Not surprisingly, there were many people dining and drinking on Friday night which was awesome to see.  When we got there, we had to wait 30 minutes just because there was so many people.  We finally got our seats, and looked at the menu.  There were some interesting things on the menu that we were not familiar with.  This is where it got really ugly.  The waitress with the tattoos came over and asked what we wanted.  When we asked questions about the menu, she just kind of gave a one word answer, and did not seem that she liked us or wanted to be there.  I understand that being a server sucks sometimes, but you have to be nice to your customers be somewhat passionate about the restaurant.  It's meatballs; everyone should be passionate about in some capacity.    As far as the food goes, two of my friends did not like their chicken meatball dish because they said it lacked flavor.   I ended up getting a pork meatball slider with pesto sauce, and tomato risotto.  They were both fantastic and not too filling.  The risotto was creamy without being mushy.  The pork slider was meaty of course, and the pesto sauce, added nutty basil flavor to the meatball.  Overall I thought the food was fantastic, but the server needs to be more passionate and nicer overall.  I will come back regardless to try the other kinds of meatballs.",

    "text": "A group of five family and friends decided to grab a bite to eat at 5:45 on a Saturday night, before we saw Cabaret at the Benedum. First time for three of us, the other two had been here before. We were pleasantly surprised to be seated at Emporio immediately upon entering. The wait staff quickly served us water, asked us for our drinks and we had all five on the table within 5-7 minutes of being seated. Outstanding. The group ordered a variety of foods, including tomato risotto, salads, mac and cheese, the anniversary saucy balls in marina over penne and spaghetti and a meatball sandwich. Drinks ranged from drafts to wine to rum and coke. All were refilled quickly and without being pushed on us. We shared the donuts in chocolate dipping sauce for dessert.  The feel is casual, the tables, while being close together don't make you feel like you are sitting with the people next to you. It is not overly noisy but has enough ambient sounds so that your conversation isn't the center of attention for three nearby tables. TV sets were on ESPN or RootSports to view the Penguins. Another thumbs up for the sports fans in our group. Wonderful experience, great good/solid food for a nice price. And we were easily done with our meals and drinks and dessert in time for the 8:00 show. That in itself was worth the good review. Many times we try to grab a bite to eat before a show and end up having to cut the meal or drinks short in order to make the show. Not so at Emporio. Well done.",

I've been a few times now hoping it would be different, but it hasn't been - even when there are barely any customers.  The bartenders honestly seem to keep their heads down, talk to each other, or just race around making drinks while always conveniently avoiding eye contact.  When you finally get someone's attention behind the bar, they usually are nice from there.   I have only eaten on the first floor, which has pretty good food (and much better service).   I really just go up for the appearance of the bar.  If there were another rooftop bar downtown (that's not a ritzy top of a hotel), I would for sure go there instead.",

We also got the cheesy bread appetizer with the tomato basil cream sauce instead of the marina it comes with that they suggested and it was excellent. My boyfriend got the crack sauce for his Choice of a sauce and it was exactly the way it was described because it was delicious. It was a ranch base sauce and a must try!",

The restaurant has a very fresh vibe and was filled with patrons of all ages.  We waited about 5 minutes for a table during peak dinner hours. The bruschetta was delicious, perfectly balanced.  The meatballs were good, had a nice flavor, but were a little soft for my tastes. They'd have been better with a hard sear on them but the sauce was wonderful and the bread provided a great crispy foil to the soft meatballs. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. If we lived here we'd definitely make this a go to spot!",

Foodwise, I have had:  Meatball panini with dipping sauce - probably the better item versus the other below choices. Reason being is that the sandwich must be pressed in a panini press, forcing out a hot sandwich.  Still hungry after having this.  3.5 stars.  Meatballs over pasta (Saucy Balls with pasta option).  Meatballs taste okay with the spicy meatballs having the most flavor.  Meatballs in all visits are never hot and lukewarm at best.  2.5 stars  Tater tots:  good.  Crunchy and crispy.  If I crave tator tots, I will come here.  Probably will not return due to cold meatballs and high lunch prices for non-filling/satisfying content.",

Actually the only issue we had with the entire evening was using the nowait app and expecting a 15 minute wait, when in reality it was closer to 30 minutes. I guess I can't blame them, it was a Saturday night, so I am assuming it's one of their busiest nights. While we were waiting we saw numerous people coming in thinking they could get to the restaurant by the elevator, other people using the stairs and not being able to get to the rooftop deck, and just a general cluster of people that didn't seem to know where they were going. I think this would best be sold having a member of the waitstaff at the doors directing people and helping them so that they knew where they were headed. I had looked over the menu previously so I already knew what I wanted to order, my husband ended up going with meatball grinder just a basic meatball sub that you could get anywhere, but he really enjoyed it. I was super excited to try the chicken meatballs with the crack sauce over the crispy brussel sprouts. They were just as good as I had expected. The meatballs were a little bit tough but the flavor was excellent, the crack sauce had that little bit of kick, and the brussel sprouts were perfection. I ended up bringing one of my for meatballs and quite a few of the brussel sprouts home. Next time I go I may just end up getting 3 meatballs instead of 4. I would love to try some different variations of meatballs and also some different sauces so we will definitely be back here again.",

What I loved is that it's breathable and roomy yet still obviously a popular place. I honestly cannot recall what cocktail I selected, but it was good as was the baked brie.   When the time came for our dinner reservation, we had to take the elevator from the third floor to the first floor and then walk up to the second floor. Walking up a flight of stairs didn't bother me, but I do not like when restaurants fail to make this information wildly clear early on. It's simply an accessibility issue. Even if an elevator is available to the second floor, feeling as though it isn't could cause discomfort; some disabilities aren't visible.  For dinner, I had the quattro formaggi pizza with anchovies. Cheese and seafood are high on my list of favorites, so I enjoyed my meal. While the ambiance was otherwise pleasant, the temperature was quite swampy. Our server, on the other hand, was also pleasant though I cannot remember his name.   Overall, I'm obviously not coming back any time soon since I live a nine-hour car drive away, but if I were closer, I'd definitely consider heading to the rooftop for some drinks and appetizers, but I don't necessarily think the food itself is anything special.",

    "text": "The idea and layout of this restaurant is what makes it so interesting. There are 3 floors, bottom serves their famous meatballs, floor 2 serves additional italian meals, and the top floor is a rooftop beer garden. We chose the bottom floor and ordered meatballs. On the menu, you choose the number of meatballs, the meat type (ask what the monthly special is, you'll find an interesting new flavor), the sauce to put on the meatballs, and lastly what side they should go with. The sauces and sides range depending on your preferred taste. You can have sweet or spicy, and add traditional pasta noodles or go outside of the box with tater tots. I ordered the Loaded Baked Potato and really enjoyed it, truly a perfect comfort food. This included classic beef meat balls, white cheddar mashed potatoes, tater tots, american cheese, bacon, and scallions. While the bowl only includes 2 meat balls, I was full about 3/4 the way through my meal and took the rest to go. Meals are a bit on the pricey side for meatballs but the unique idea and atmosphere of this restaurant are worth checking it out.",

    "text": "Review for Mezzo:  It's really hard to write a review based on our experience at just one of the spots but here goes. We arrived around 9:15 pm knowing that the kitchens closed for the evening at 10 pm. We decided to go to the rooftop beer garden but once we realized they only served bar snacks (also only until 10 pm) we went to Mezzo instead. Even though there is an elevator for all 3 floors we had to take the elevator from the 3rd floor to 1st floor and then take a flight of steps to the 2nd floor ( i wish it had been clear that the 1nd floor was only accessible by stairs somewhere.) When we sat down and looked at the menu the options seemed great. I ordered the baby spinach salad and the small plate risotto, my brother ordered the gnocchi (also a starter) and my sister ordered the arugula salad. I loooved my salad it had roasted pecans, goat cheese and was dressed with just the right amount and had a great flavor. My risotto on the other hand was so disappointing - I would compare the risotto to like a macaroni salad you would serve at a BBQ  - in taste and texture. It was heavy with cream but not in a good way almost tasted like mayo and the texture of it was really off putting like lumpy.  My brother knew ahead of time that he was ordering a starter but the serving size of the gnocchi was really small - for $8 he got like 10 pieces of gnocchi but he really enjoyed it. My sister's salad was underdressed and she had to request more dressing. The service was amazing though, our waitress was attentive and the hostess was really nice. I would definitely come back here for drinks but I will not be returning to Mezzo - being a pescaratian and trying a lot of the items we could eat it really was just meh. Come here for the rooftop bar - not the food.",

    "text": "Emporio Meatball kitchen is yet another gastronomical disappointment here in Pittsburgh.  The chicken gravy, tater tot poutine was bland and tasteless and I think only survives by having more cheese than potatoes.  The meatballs have a spongy texture that makes me think they are undercooked. Especially the vegetarian where it is the texture and flavor of dried out refried black beans.  One of the sliders we got had a stale bun. It was hard as a rock and not at all toasted.  The pork bolognese sauce tasted like chef Boyardee, but they have a government cheese sauce as well so I shouldn't be surprised by that.  The ricotta doughnuts were ok, but bland. I could taste the powdered sugar on top, but almost nothing from the doughnut itself.  Definitely not someplace to come back to.",

    "text": "visited pittsburgh this past weekend and went to sienna since we heard there was a beer garden? lol   arrived at 730 and put our name down on the first floor ... aaand the wait was an hr n a half long T_T so we just proceeded to the 3rd fl rooftop bar and got some beers to start~ wow the rooftop is just beautiful! the place was packed on a sat evening! most of the tables were taken and even the balcony was packed. Thankfully, we were able to get a table for our group of 5~ i was starving and wanted to get some appetizer to start.. but apparently the menus are different on every floor? the beer list was quite extenisve~ but appetizers were not too appealing.. so we decided to wait it out.  FINALLY after some time, our table downstairs was ready at last! thank god for that refreshing watermelon beer to keep my mind off of the hunger. lol the menu on the 1st fl was all about them balls of meat!  it is exactly like the meatball shop in NYC!! which i absolutely adore! so we knew exactly how this was going to go down.. pick a type of ball, a sauce and a side.  i got the \"saucey balls\" which is a set of 4 and i picked the traditional beef meat balls with pesto on top.  i was also ecstatic to see a menu for poutine! my o my~ i got my tater tots fix alright!  added some bacon to it and had a side of chicken gravy for dipping.  i wasn't big on the chicken gravy.. BUT surprisingly, the tots tasted fantastic with the pesto sauce from my bowl of meatballs!! so huh~ how bout that? tater tots with pesto..?   i definitely struggled to finish all the things in front of me.. everything was delicious! including their special sausage meatballs~ and boy! was this hearty meal fulfilling and satisfying! watch out meatball shop in nyc! sienna mercato is right up in your alley! lol i would not b surprised if sienna mercato makes its way to the east coast~ the variations offered at sienna is a huge game changer!  PLUS tots?? i'm sold .. sry MBS~ you're gonna have to step up your game to win me back :P",

It was fine, the sauce was good but the meatballs themselves didn't have much flavor.  The brussel sprouts were way over cooked and salted; these have been better previously.   We had the pepperoni fritters and they also seemed slightly overdone, they were small and seasoning exterior was too overdone and it overpowered everything else.   Ambiance is great here, no wait app was 20 minutes off.   Have had some good dishes here and risotto and poutain have been good",

We got 2 different types of Saucy balls with 2 different types of sauce and 2 sides.  Obviously - my fav was the Beef and Pesto, however the spicy pork with pork bolognese is quite scrumptious as well!  Our sides were greens and beans and tomato risotto - both of which were superb!  I can't say enough about how scrumptious the food was.  The only bummer - for me was - the 3rd floor bar has a local cider joint on tap - Arsenal Cider.  I was quite bummed to find that they didn't have Arsenal on the first floor.  While I enjoy Strongbow - supporting local businesses is always the ideal in my world :)  With oodles of local craft beers, you'd think that you'd support the ONE local cider location :)  Other than the simple cider snafu, I can't wait to go back!",

I was not amazed or satisfied with these meatballs. I tried their beef, chicken, pork and veg meatballs. It's hard to even pick a favorite from the four. The meatballs were flavorless, mushy, and just not right. The appetizers and sides were good however. I loved the quinoa. The cheesy bread and salad were solid choices. But the star of the show should've been the meatballs and hence the 1-star. Probably would not give this another chance. Sorry!",

We had some difficulty getting seated with the host and hostess, but our waitress more than made up for this. She was very knowledgeable, honest, and helpful. I ordered the wedding soup with a beef meatball; the meatball was fantastic bursting with garlic flavor! I found myself adding salt to the wedding soup itself. We ate light so that we could try some desserts; I tried the ricotta doughnuts which were excellent! I also tried the red velvet doughnut balls. The ricotta doughnuts are served warm sprinkled with powdered sugar with a bowl of chocolate dipping sauce. The red velvet doughnut balls are served cold and compacted with cream cheese-like frosting. Both were good, but I thought the ricotta doughnuts were much better---crispy on the outside, but chewy and warm on the inside! The next time I come here, I'd like to see what the Rooftop Beer Garden is all about; it was closed for a private event when we went.",

    "text": "An old and very good friend of mine was dying to hit Sienna Mercato prior to a show, and despite my middling prior experience with them, I caved.   I've found that if you don't get too risky in terms of your choices, you might have an above average meal here. For instance, I stuck with a Classic Beef Meatball Panino and found that it paid dividends when it came to succulence and decadently plush texture, the halves of bread tasting like the most divine buttered toast in the region. My chosen cheese was smoked gouda, which possessed an alchemist fantasy flavor blend of charred, creamy, and nutty. The Pork Bolognese sauce I requested could have been served in a cheddar-crusted crock topped with diced onion and called chili. I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference, and I would have been very happy with it,  the rich, meaty, bowl of stewed vine fruit providing for me a bit of a warm, comforting relief on a bitter winter's evening.   The House Cut French Fries were adeptly prepared, meaning they were twice-fried crisp and not limply blanched, even if I felt the kitchen went a little gonzo with the herbs and parmesan. But aye, they were merely a vessel for the fantastically aromatic and addictive malt vinegar aioli.   Remember what I said about taking chances? My friend Dan did, going with their \"Ball of the Day\" along with 3 other selections. Despite my reluctance, he insisted that I sample a chunk of his Cordon Bleu meatball, and Eureka, it actually tasted like a successful, ground-up take on the real thing! Wet, dense, and savory, the sphere or reconstituted poultry even had the milky, tangy sauce that makes the dish. Well done, chef.   Sienna Mercato is still a bit trendy for my tastes, and their tradition-defying experimentation doesn't always sparkle, but when they stick to the fundamentals, they exceed expectations.   P.S. The service was fine overall.   P.P.S. On our weeknight visit, the joint was dead, but hey, we didn't mind at all. At least Bambi and The Ratchets weren't there. Hey, we're both committed, y'know? Geez.",

The restaurant was pretty packed on a Saturday afternoon but there was no wait at around 1PM. It was a pretty spacious restaurant, no tables squished together which I hate.   Food was alright. As a starter we got the crab balls and they were meh, wouldn't recommend it. I got the 4 balls: spicy pork, marinara and an order of spaghetti. The pork tasted a bit weird in my opinion and I should've went for the classic beef. My parents both got the salad with one ball: mom got classic beef with mushroom gravy and dad got vegetarian with arribiatta, which he said was delicious! He was dipping almost everything dippable in that arribiatta sauce. We also got a side of parmesan broccoli, which was actually my favorite part of the meal!!  The service was just okay. Not terrible but not very attentive or welcoming/friendly.  This place reminded me of New York City's Meatball Shop but not as good. Overall, it was decent but I wouldn't come again.",

    "text": "After a day's worth of driving, Sienna Mercato proved the perfect landing spot to unwind, eat, and drink.   We arrived at the restaurant at about 9pm and the place was packed. We opted to put our names on the list to be seated on the second floor, which offered a more family style dining experience compared to the first floor (a \"meatball joint\") or the third floor (a rooftop beer garden). With a 30-minute wait ahead of us, we learned that sitting and ordering at the bar was an option and decided to forgo the wait for an immediate seat.  For dinner, we chose to share a couple of plates. Brought out at the same time, we ordered a large charcuterie plate and a small plate of Pennsylvania made cheeses. The charcuterie was simply wonderful. The large plate offered pork taurine, Genoa salami, pate, duck speck, and dried pork loin among others. The meats, all of which are house-cured, were paired with pickled vegetables, smashed San Marzano tomatoes, and crostini. The cheese plate was well curated to match and paired with candied almonds and a raisin chutney. The selection of cheeses varied in intensity, beginning with a mild smoked Gouda and concluding with an intense, yet balanced, bleu cheese.  Our meal concluded with the tiramisu. While very good, the cream was a bit heavy for my taste (but this was probably because I had just consumed several pounds of meat and cheese).  When you combine this attention to detail with an excellent staff and efficient operation, there's no question why Sienna Mercato is a huge success.",

    "text": "A different idea, with different restaurants on each floor.  We stopped in on an early Sunday evening, around 5pm and got a seat on the first floor.  This floor focuses on the meatballs.  I must say, I really enjoyed the meatball dish that I had.  I went with the Chicken Meatball with a marinara sauce.  My wife went with the gyro meatball special and was quite impressed.  The staff here seems pretty disinterested in service.  Our waiter failed to ask us if we wanted desert or coffee or another drink before unceremoniously dropping off the check.  We decided to go upstairs to the top level to have a drink.  We sat ourselves and waited about 10 minutes before I decided to go up to the bar for drink menus.  No one seemed interested in seeing if I needed anything.  Since the place was fairly empty I found this to be frustrating.  After obtaining drink menus we waited another 10 minutes to see if anybody would stop by and take our order.  The two waitresses, who were waiting on the 7 total tables of people, walked by numerous times but nothing.  We ended up just walking out and leaving.  Talk about disinterested and unprofessional staff.    Really good food, blah service.  Too many places to go to so I won't be back.",

Turns out, unlike the entire state of PA, they don't accept international passports (or Indian, in our case). Even a valid US visa with photo and date of birth was insufficient. Trying to reason with them was impossible owing to the stubbornness of the management. All this made worse considering we were waiting for a table for 20 minutes.  Thoroughly disappointed!",

We chose the meatball floor, put our name in, and went up to the 3rd floor to grab drinks and wait.  The 3rd floor bar is so nice! I loved the rooftop. We got drinks and just chatted, waiting for our table. Just under 90 mins later, our app told us the table was ready, so we headed downstairs and were seated right away.  For the table we got an order of fried pickle chips (sooooooo fantastic) and buffalo chicken balls. The chicken was really spicy but really good. For dinner I chose two pork meatballs with the pork bolongese (panini). My friends got sliders, and we also got two sides of risotto to split.  There was sooo much food! We barely put a dent in the risotto, and I could only eat half of my panini. It was pretty spicy. It was just okay.. Not my favorite. My friends got one of the Asian meatball sliders (it was the daily special) and said it was fantastic. I wish I got that!  The price was actually really affordable. We got split checks, and each of us paid less than $20, including tip (but not including our drinks we paid for upstairs).  So, final word: great rooftop bar; very crowded; good prices; decently-good food. I'd come back, but maybe earlier in the day with less of a wait.",

Probably the busiest restaurant in Pittsburgh, and for very good reason. Great-tasting food, fair prices, and top-notch service.  Floor by floor breakdown: Mezzo's great for more intimate gatherings. (Make a reservation!) For sure more of an adult vibe, but families come too.   The roof, Il Tetto, is most definitely worth the wait, especially on a clear night. Drinks are great, good scene, fun people, what else could you want?  Emporio is all-around awesome. Perfect for the quick and easy business lunch, you can take the kids before a Pirates game, bar is fun, great prices, 30 beers on tap. We're big fans of bartender Scott... 10/10 on the drinks and bar knowledge. Risotto is superb. And it's always fun to try the special ball of the month. Cute little server girls are an added bonus.",

This is a MUST in Pittsburgh.  The roof top bar has a great selection on tap with some ciders as well (good gluten free option).  The view is amazing.  It's a glass top, so closed when cold, open when warmer.  After drinks we headed down to Emporio for dinner.  The menu is not something I've seen before.  Some intriguing app, but we didn't indulge. The gist of the menu is MEATBALLS.  Four types, meat, veggie, pork, or turkey (which is the only gluten free option, but well worth it).  Then picking a sauce, and style. (Saucy balls are a must).  Sides are available.  I had my turkey meatballs with arrabbiata sauce over gluten free penne.  I also asked for a side of the tzatziki sauce, because it's one of my favs (worth it). My wife had the veggie balls with a mushroom gravy over tater tots, yes tater tots. Don't make that face, they were great she said.  The atmosphere is very inviting, staff/service at both spots were on point.  Cannot wait to return.  Highly recommend this place.",

Our waitress was incredibly knowledgeable, recommending the best sauces for each dish. We got the Poutine with tots and crack sauce (ranch and hot sauce), oh my lanta that was so good. We destroyed that dish. For our entrees I got the teriyaki chicken meatball (their seasonal ball) and classic beef in a bowl over tortellini with meat sauce. It was a classic Italian based bowl, but was very filling and very good. Because we are all of the poutine we only ate about half of our bowl and took the rest home. I would definitely go back and get the Poutine again, not changing a thing, but try a new bowl combination.",

My go to meal is two turkey meatball sliders, one with the pesto sauce and the other with the government cheese then a side of the tomato risotto and a nice cold beer. Could eat that every day.  I've only been to Mezzo once so far and was a fan but think I need to go again to really solidify my opinion. The meat and cheese plate was a wonderful assortment and the pizza I had was quite good. The wine selection is also impressive.  Il Tetto is the place to go after your meal, it's an amazing place to have a drink and look at the sky with the glass roof or when it's nice they have it open. The food is more snack food but it's definitely high level bar food with bruschetta, fried brussel sprouts and of course the cheese plate.  Overall the space is amazing on all three floors and you really can't go wrong by going there for a night on the town, a special occasion dinner or even just casual. You can always find what you're looking for.",

My go-to's at Emporio are the poutine and \"Saucy Balls\" with chicken meatballs, crack sauce, and mac & cheese. If you're still reading, you deserve to know the best kept secret about Sienna Mercato: their RICOTTA DOUGHNUTS. Accompanied by a bowl of dipping chocolate and paired with a nice cup of coffee, they're the perfect ending to an Italian night out.

The roof is simple - a glass roof, some twinkle lights, and a view of the Cultural District.  A great hang out and awesome waiting spot for your table downstairs.    Down in the emporium we enjoyed the same great beer list and some amazing meatballs - we did the buffalo appetizer - spicy and addicting...but let's be honest, all the meatballs were addicting.  I elected to do three different sliders and while full forced myself to finish each delectable bite. The atmosphere is busy but in a fun way.

    "text": "The girls at the hostess stand were very nice.  They helped us look at the menu and made recommendations and convinced my friend and I to eat here.  Well, I should say they convinced us to try to eat here, because no eating was done.  We were seated at a table squeezed between two other tables.  That was fine though, because one table was finishing up and the other was eating.  One waitress went to the table to our left four times while we sat there...once to clear plates, then to drop the check, then again to pick up the check and finally to bring the receipt.  The table to our right had another waitress serving them and she checked on them, as well as three other tables to the right.  She even had to bring one table five \"to go\" bags!  The table to our left was cleared once the people took their receipt and left.  Unfortunately, the lady sitting there forgot her coat, but the waitress talked to a bus boy and asked him to see if he could catch her.  He couldn't so they put the coat behind the bar.  Why am I telling you all of this?  Because that's all I can tell you.  We sat there while numerous employees were inches from us, interacting with every other customer in the place but not a single server made eye contact with us, offered us water, said \"be right with you\" or acknowledged that we existed.  I went up to tell the hostess who sat us that nobody was serving our table and she shrugged and apologized but seemed helpless to understand that if nobody is going to serve a table, you probably shouldn't seat people there.  So we went down the block to Ten Penny where actual people recognized that we were hungry people who wanted food and drink and were willing to pay for it and had a great meal.  I get that on a Sunday evening when you're busier than expected, service might suffer.  But just tell me that up front and I'll go somewhere else rather than sit in a restaurant for 15 minutes being ignored and dissatisfied and end up writing a one star review for your unacceptable level of service on Yelp.",

    "text": "I have had Sienna Mercato bookmarked for six months, and I finally came here a few weeks ago with my dad before attending the Symphony.  We came in around 4:30, and it was fairly quiet.  By six, there was a wait on a Friday night.  There are apparently two more levels upstairs, but we ate on the first floor with the meatballs!  I ordered the panini, which is two meatballs.  It was more of a lunch size in my mind, and I would recommend something with 3+ meatballs for dinner.  I choose the beef meatballs, which were yummy.  They are an odd texture, but very large and delicious.  I ordered the creamy Parmesan sauce.  Interestingly, Sienna Mercato places the sauce on the side, so you dip your sandwich.  They are certainly not stingy with the fabulous and delicious sauce.  You also get cheese on the panini.  Overall, my dad and I both enjoyed our sandwiches.  Service was a little lackluster.  Our waitress was great, until she realized no alcohol was being ordered.  She didn't even drop off the check herself, which kind of left a bad impression.  It was a little off-putting to have someone push alcohol so hard.  Otherwise, the prices are fair for downtown, and I would return.",

    "text": "This was my second time at Emporium on the 1st floor. They specialize in meatballs. They have Classic Beef, Spicy Pork, Chicken, and Vegetarian. They have 9 different types of sauces. They range from Marinara to Creamy Parmesan to Chicken Gravy. You can order sliders, panini, meatball sandwiches, and even Saucy Balls. The slider is 1 meatball, the panini is 2, the sandwich is 3, and saucy balls is 4. With the saucy balls you can order a couple of different sauces. They also have different sides like mac n cheese, tarot tots, and several others. You can also order a side of pasta. They have 4 types to choose from. I think it's fun to go with people who also like to try new things and just order random items. I have tried several different things. My favorite is the Chicken Meatball with Creamy Parmesan. They go well with the Tater Tots. My second favorite is the Classic Beef meatball with Pork Bolognese sauce with a side of pasta.  They start your meal buy bringing you a tall glass bottle of room temp flat water. They open it and pour you a glass. They have a full bar. The have a nice selection of craft beers. I usually get iced tea. They serve desserts but I usually don't have room left to try one. Maybe next time we'll order dessert 1st.",

I got the vegetarian meatball panini and it far exceeded my expectation in terms of size of meatball and flavor.  Your entire panini is essentially your meatballs.  I also consider the white bean, mushroom meatball a thoughtfully crafted vegetarian choice, compared to other restaurants who consider their vegetarian option some sort of overcooked seitan.  My only caveat is that the panini is a little small for the $7.50 price tag.  I think it would have been more appropriately priced at $6.  It's definitely snack size.  With such a great vegetarian option, I'm sure their carnivorous options are more than great!",

When a \"meatball place\" was recommended,  we weren't sure but wanted to give it a chance. My daughter ordered a chicken, while hubby & I got regular meatballs. We always share. They were all good, but the chicken ones were fantastic! She also ordered mac & cheese with as alfredo sauce. Heavenly! We ended up trading half our paninis and our 2~year old slept through dinner (she as te back in our hotel room).   If you're in Pittsburgh and anywhere near it, stop here and order the chicken panini. You won't regret it.",

We ordered calamari over a savory spread (almond, cashews, maybe tomato among other delicious mystery ingredients), burrata with a balsamic reduction, and pork meatballs with endive and radicchio. The sauce paired with meatballs was incredible!  - great selection of drinks - bar seating was ample, clean, service was phenomenal - very friendly atmosphere  Things I didn't like: -  the meatballs were a bit dry and dense, but the flavor was definitely there, so I would have liked a different texture with the flavor profiles in this dish, or perhaps not served in meatball form...idk I didn't go to culinary school I just eat  Overall I'm hopeful to return to see what else they have to serve! Their charcuterie sounds amazing, as well as their pizza menu!",

We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table on the 2nd floor (Il Mezzo) so we went up to the 3rd floor (Il Tetto), which is a rooftop beer garden with retractable glass roof, to grab a drink. We got draft beers and took in the city views as the sun set. The top floor was a lively bar atmosphere with lots of people socializing. It was a big space with room for a crowd. Our table was ready on time and we were seated near the front of the restaurant by the streetside window. We got the parmesan and peppers pizza, arugula salad and arancini. Everything was very tasty. Our server was great and so was our overall experience. The first floor is a more casual meatball shop - not our thing as vegetarians, so it was great that they had all these options. Great spot to have a small party or go out with friends.",

We first went to the rooftop bar first while waiting for the other people in the group to arrive. It is a fun environment and I highly recommend it if you are looking for an outdoor experience in the middle of downtown sorrounded by tall buildings.  This definitely looked like a great place with very good reviews and the group I went with enjoyed the food. However, I didn't really like the food. Part of the reason is the trouble I had with ordering the food since I am neither a meat ball not a pasta person. So, it was not easy for me to find a dish I could order. I ended up ordering poutine with tater tots and fried egg. The egg was delicious. I liked the tater tots, but i hope I had asked them to add less cheese.   I might go back to this place and try something else next time.",

I've never tried chili with spaghetti or even with chicken balls. But it was a pleasant surprise. The texture of the chicken balls aren't as put together and thick as meatballs normally would be but still delicious.   My friend and I split the poutine which we ordered with house cut fries and bacon bits sprinkled on top. We were able to choose a sauce and we got the Crack Sauce. Yes, you read it right haha. And I knew exactly why when I first tried it. It's a mixture of ranch and hot sauce, and it was just as tasty and addicting as its name implies.   Lastly, my friend ordered the Fuggetta-Bowl-It! This is one of its popular dishes. It's a creamy Parmesan spaghetti with classic beef meatballs in meat sauce and shaved Parmesan on top. I don't think you can ever be disappointed by the classic spaghetti and meatballs. The only thing that I thought was a little off for my taste was that the meatball in this dish tasted much saltier than my meatballs. But the weird thing was that my friend was saying the exact opposite of my reaction... don't know how that happened haha.   The food is a bit pricey and salty so I'd give it a 4/5. The service was good and the space is really big so I don't think seating would be a problem, since this place has 3 floors.  I'd definitely want to check out the rooftop bar next time!",

My group split the bruschetta appetizer which was fine. Then the meatballs came. I had the veg meatballs \"saucy\" style ( 4 balls with sauce on top). I had the creamy tomato basil on the recommendation of the waiter. The sauce was good but there was not enough. Any piece of the meatball without the sauce was much too dry. The waiter also asked us if we would like cheese on top. What he failed to mention was the parmesan shavings were an additional charge. While it wasn't a huge deal, I would have forgone it had I known (probably best to be upfront ). While the food was okay and the atmosphere was nice, I would probably not go back.

I think that was too heavy for me as next time I might try it as a meatball sub and also hopefully get some greens at the same time!   One one of my co-workers got the sauteed Brussels Sprouts - I found these to be well cooked but unfortunately they tasted bitter to me as well.  For dessert, our table of 11 got the beignets plus the red velvet cake mini- donuts. For me the clear Winn was the beignets - I could have licked clean the accompanying bowl of chocolate sauce! In contrast the red velvet tasted a bit heavy and stodgy.  Overall a brilliantly good night out - I'm now anxious to try out the food on Floors #2 and #3!  Yelp Review 57/2017",

    "text": "Calling all Pittsburgh foodies this is the new downtown hot spot!!  I love meatballs and could not wait to try this place out. They do not take reservations but are on No Wait and we really did not have to wait at all-it was a Sunday night but the place was bumping!  They had a nice selection of draft beers-I went with my favorite White Lightening by Full Pint.  We started with the buffalo chicken meatballs (tasted just like boneless buffalo wings) which was mixed in a sauce with blue cheese and shredded celery-the perfect combo and not too spicy. Now on to the exciting part picking your meatballs and sauce.  I went with the classic beef meatballs on a Panini with gouda cheese (you can pick from 3 cheeses). They had a variety of sauces and I stuck with the classic tomato sauce. It was the perfect combo of sweet and savory and a terrific combo.  For my side I went with the pasta fagiolo which was delicious. They have a nice selection of soups including wedding soup and matzo ball soup and you can add meatballs to any of them for a small charge. My date ordered the saucy balls-you get 4 meatballs although you cannot mix and match.  He went with the spicy pork with the tzatziki sauce to cool it down a little. The tzatzikii sauce was fantastic!  For $4 extra dollars you can have the balls put on a side and he choose the tomato risotto (different flavor each day).  The service was great, loved the atmosphere and can't wait to go back and try out more combos!!",

Bar service was horrible, waited forever to be served. Once we finally told our table was ready, we were told they were just cleaning it off, waited another 29 minutes and then asked again and were told we were waiting because people has their elbows on the table... OK. I got Bruchetta which should be called tomatoes on toast. I walked down the stairs to have a smoke and came back up the stairs, which I guess is not allowed, although I had a seat at a table and had been there for a while to be met by a bouncer and the horrible hostess who yelled at me and told me to leave. She was so rude, threatened to call the police on me. I did nothing illegal and was not rude, initially. I can't believe this happened!",

    "text": "This place looks like a high class barn. A little odd on the decor. First off the menu is confusing. The waitress had to explain everything a couple times. There are no descriptions of the all different sauces on the menu. We had to have the waitress describe those to us as well.   We had a combination of saucy balls at our table. Everyone liked everything. The meatballs are a good size. If you start with an app or a salad you'd probably be okay with two balls. If you're just eating balls you'll need four. I had one slider with the Sunday gravy (basic red sauce) and the poutine on the side. I was able to eat half my fries.   The cheesy bread is to die for and all the salads were very fresh with high quality ingredients.   In addition to the confusing menu bringing the waitress over every three minutes, they also give you the tiniest glasses. I think everyone was in constant need of a refill. I'm pretty sure if you were there on a busy night you would not get the attention you needed from the waitress.  One last tiny peeve is that the two tables they pushed together for us were both wobbly as well as three of our six chairs. Oh and the cocktails are over priced for the size. My 4oz sloe gin fizz was $8.   All of that said, the service great, the food was fresh and fairly priced. I'm excited to see the next two levels once their open.",

    "text": "Love, love this place.  Have been three times and had an excellent experience each time.  They've been running a jalapeno pork meatball in beer cheese sauce special that's outstanding.  On my last visit, my mom ordered the spicy pork in the parm sauce -- quite delish.  Also found the pickle chips and the tater tots to be above the norm.  (Do skip the escarole and beans, though.  They were on the more mediocre side, especially considering the other options.  Also we weren't huge fans of the turkey meatball.)  Service is quick and pleasant.  Booze prices are reasonable and the selection quite good.  Try their negroni if you like them -- you won't be disappointed.  Overall, a really great and reasonably priced addition to downtown.  (If you've been to the meatball shop in NYC, this place is a nice borrowing of the idea...)   Oh, and to one of the prior comments... you can get meatballs with sauce individually.  My mom did just yesterday.  It might be priced differently than the \"saucy balls entree\", but it is definitely possible.  Just ask.",

    "text": "How does one take a mundane thing such as a meatballs and turn it into a masterpiece of culinary chef d'oeuvre. Taking a dish, that most of us have extensive exposure to and flip our preconceived perceptions of the lowly maligned meatball. They elevate this stalwart of many a dish from supporting cast to the bell of the ball! I know what you must be thinking how could a meatball shop be \"trendy\" or \"classy\". Well all you have to do is step through the doors of this new shop and you will not only see but know the answer. This new gem on the street of cuisine is an amazing addition to the fare available. This former piano gallery has transformed into a fun filled establishment buzzing with life and full of verve. When you first walk in the dark wood and metal create a warm, cozy, yet upscale feel. You are greeted at the door with smiles and welcomed to the fun.  There are no reservations needed so there can be a wait but Mercato is part of the modern trend of restaurants that utilize your smart phone to help with the wait. So download for free the app NoWait and you can check in before arriving so you are already in line plus if they don't show on the list there is ... no wait! Once you are seated the servers all have been absolutely incredible. We have had the distinct privilege of being served by Nick twice now who elevated our experience from great to truly don't miss out! The servers have fun with the names of the dishes on the list and yes you can easily get a bit irreverent and borderline inappropriate with the play on ordering \"saucy balls\" and \"grinders\". Additionally the drinks are based on a bit of a throwback so nothing overly fancy or crazy names just good drinks to accompany GREAT food! Not often can I say this about a restaurant but nothing on the menu is substandard it's all good! From the poutine which when ordered with mushroom gravy and an egg on top is as close as you'll get to an order of this awesomeness in Toronto. The beef, pork, chicken, and specialty balls are all amazing and not one of the myriad of sauces are wonderfully crafted and superbly delicious. The menu is uncomplicated and easily perused but because of how incredible everything is it rapidly descends into the depths of your own disappointment as you only have enough space in your own belly to fit so much.  With the promise of two more floors being nearly completed for the summer, the quality, care, and flavors that their food delivers on I am waiting with baited breath and salivating incisors at the fine food these additions will unveil to the world of Pittsburgh. In other more simple terms...... What are you waiting for (besides a table) get down to Penn Ave and have your mind and taste buds blown away by those saucy balls at Sienna Mercato Emporio. You'll leave with a new found respect for the simple yet majestically masterful meatball and all this little leviathan will bring to your palate. Oh yeah all of this for a reasonable cost ta-boot!!! Thank you Nick from Nicholas Coffee for a wonderfully amazing addition to the street of cuisine may all your future endeavors be as incredible as this!!",

    "text": "In the past week, my girlfriend and I have eaten at Sienna Mercato in two different capacities - first, in the restaurant in their fine-dining \"Mezzo\" restaurant, then again at the \"Emporio\" food stand at the pop-up market on Friday, July 10.  Of Sienna Mercato, I can only say this: their food is some of the most poorly thought-out, most poorly executed, and most pretentious food I have ever eaten. I didn't leave this restaurant merely disappointed, I left angry, confused, and utterly frustrated at one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  Let's start with Mezzo. Mezzo started off okay: the server was friendly and knowledgeable, and the wine selection was top-notch. The menu seemed a bit small, but that's okay if the dishes are executed poorly. The location itself was lovely; open air, overlooking the street, and very comfortable.  My girlfriend and I started with two appetizers: the artisan bread selection and the lamb meatballs. The breads were excellent, and the spreads that went with them were too. The lamb meatballs were decent; they tasted okay, but they were lukewarm at best and the rest of the accompaniments didn't work (including raisins for some unknown reason).  However, we pressed onward, hoping that some not-hot-enough meatballs would be the only culinary mistake of the night. Unfortunately, the meal continued to go sideways before crashing and burning completely. I ordered the Filet Mignon as their daily farm-to-plate meat special, while my girlfriend ordered their Farmhouse Chicken. My Filet was just fine, but the rest of the dish made no sense. The steak was served with a piece of radicchio that had been pickled and grilled, which left it tasting bitter and awful. The greens were undressed and existed more than anything else. The radicchio was placed over a bed of some kind of puree, which didn't seem to taste of anything I recognized.  Unfortunately, my girlfriend's meal was worse than simply bad; hers was outright dangerous to human health. I really wish I was exaggerating, but her chicken arrived undercooked. We called the waiter over, and rather than being the knowledgeable individual from the beginning of the meal, he hemmed and hawed that he couldn't make substitutions and that he couldn't make any changes. We got the manager over, and my girlfriend switched over to the filet mignon with the sides that the chicken originally had (polenta and green beans). The manager gave us a free order of their artisan bread appetizer while the kitchen refired her food. When it came out, the filet was fine, but the polenta was simply awful. Rather than being smooth and creamy with a delicious corn flavor, it was gritty and bland. The green beans were fine, but undercooked chicken coupled with crappy sides was enough to convince us not to come back to Mezzo.  Then the bill came, and this is what truly made me angry. Even with the comped bread appetizer (a whole $3, by the way), our bill was over $80 per person. That's right, they wanted to charge us $80 a plate for food that could have killed my girlfriend. I paid the bill and walked out, wanting nothing more to do with this restaurant.  Perhaps what angered me as much as the bill, though, was how unfocused the restaurant was. The name implies Italian, the menu says farm-to-table, while the food itself wants to be molecular gastronomy. If the owner is reading this, take my advice: shut the restaurant down, sit down with your head chef, and figure out your restaurant. Once you've done that, then reopen once you know who you are.  My girlfriend and I then ran into a food stand run by Emporio (the meatball place) at the pop-up market on the 10th. I was very skeptical about their food, but I was convinced to give them a shot. Frankly, I wish I hadn't. They were serving a meatball sandwich with \"Government Cheese\" sauce, as well as a Mac 'n' Cheese made with the same Government Cheese. I wish they would have come out and said just what \"Government Cheese\" is: cheap, American cheese. That cheese overpowered every other flavor in both dishes to the point that all you could taste was cheese, cheese, cheese. Add in that the macaroni was overcooked, and Emporio's food stand was as forgettable and terrible as Mezzo.  In conclusion, the two Sienna Mercato establishments I tried provided disgusting and confusing food. It was all overpriced, but presented as some of the best food in the city of Pittsburgh. I will of course never eat here again, and I stand by my earlier advice to the owner: shut this place down and figure things out before the health inspector catches you serving raw chicken to a customer and shuts you down for good.",

My only grip with Mezzo was that the cocktail menu seemed a bit strange for the atmosphere. I was expecting Italian appertif based items when it seemed like an odd mix of whiskey and tequila instead. That being said the drink that I chose was fantastically crafted and delicious. After dinner we went to Il Tetto to catch a bit of the Pens game and while we only stayed for one beer it was at no fault of the restaurant. The weather was perfect and the rooftop is probably one of the better atmospheres to have a beer at in Pittsburgh when the weather is good. Great selection of beer and the service at this entire place is spectacular. One of our staple downtown experiences.",

    "text": "So awesome for a happy hour scene, but not for happy hour prices...  The third floor rooftop is amazing! However, the winter atmosphere was compromising. The heaters installed were uncomfortable to sit near if you were at the bar. The heat on your face is so intense, you have to face the tables so you don't get artificial sunburn.   The French75 cocktail is delectable. I didn't have a chance to try any of the bar food, but the selection was ok. It would be nice to offer more food options for the outdoor seating as well.  All in all, it was nice. Nice mix of people, and I can't wait to go the the beer garden when it gets warmer.",

We split a very flavorful mushroom pizza for a lite dinner and a hazelnut chocolate dessert to cap it off.  Beautiful restaurant. Wonderful food. I can't speak to the first and third floor, but I can confidently say Mezza (2nd floor) was a hit!",

    "text": "Sienna Mercado has 3 floors with 3 different menus. This review is for Emporio (1st floor only).   We went ice skating at PPG Plaza (separate review) and then meatballing (neologism?) for dinner. The vibe is lively but chill. Friendly service. Wood and concrete decor gives a very rustic look.   The ordering process is (unnecessarily) complicated. Ask your server to help you customize your order before it gets too expensive. We went with the saucy balls where you just get balls in sauce--no sliders, grinders, or paninis.  Collectively, we tried combinations of: Meats -turkey: gluten-free (!) but bland and disappointing -beef: loved by all -pepperoni (the special): loved by all  Sauces -marinara: great on all the balls and the fries and the penne and my fingers -pesto: good, but not great (arrived a bit cold too)  Sides -herb fries: awesome! -g/f penne: more please! -tomato risotto: must have!  Husband was wowed by the extensive craft beer selection.   Tip: It's more fun with a group so that you can eat many different combinations of balls family-style!  Tip: Use NoWait to get in line before you arrive--they don't take reservations.  P.S. I've also been to Mezzo (additional menu options), and it was also delicious, (and they do it up gluten-free!) but it was too long ago for me to review! I'll just have to go again soon!",

    "text": "Three of us ate at Mezzo on a Sunday night.   The atmosphere was pleasant, although it had been a hot day and the temperature in the restaurant was uncomfortably warm.   Our server was good, but the kitchen must have been having an off night.   We all got first courses, but one showed up about 10 minutes before the other two.  Not a big deal, but to me it was a foreshadowing of some problems in the kitchen.   Main courses came and the shrimp fra diavolo was way too spicy.  I've had it before, I know it should be spicy, but the level of spice in this dish made it impossible to finish.   The real problem came with the pork chop that appeared to be cooked on the outside, but was raw in the middle.  Only about a 1/4 of an inch of the meat all around was cooked.  I realized this after consuming some of it.  I notified the waiter who indeed seemed alarmed at the cold center of the chop and he whisked it away back to the kitchen.  Over ten minutes later it returned fully cooked, but by this time everyone else had finished and I had lost my appetite.  (I still feel sick just thinking about eating raw pork.)     The desserts were okay, but hardly enough to save the evening.  I'm guessing there was no one managing the front of the house (or the back)  because I would have expected that once a customer is served an inch and half thick pork chop with a full inch of it being raw that a manager would have swooped in to a) apologize on behalf of the kitchen, b) make some kind of gesture of forgiveness.   But no, nothing.",

We had wonderful service, the food came out quickly, and it was absolutely delicious!   I give it a 5 star review because on top of everything, this restaurant has excellent gluten free service. I have celiac disease, and sometimes it's hard for me to eat out. But not here - everything on the menu is \"a la carte\" and extremely customizable. Each gluten free menu item is clearly marked, and they have a turkey parmesan meatball that is gluten free. I was worried at first that I would struggle to find a way to eat meatballs without having a sandwich, but our server was very knowledgeable about how the food was prepared and offered numerous suggestions for how to order the meatballs safely. I ended up ordering one turkey meatball over gluten free penne with the spinach almond pesto sauce. It was absolutely to die for! I also had a side of tomato risotto which was heavenly. So gluten avoiders, just tell your server, and they will help you come up with something delicious and safe to eat!   My gluten-eating boyfriend had a grinder with the spicy pork meatballs, pork bolognese sauce, and smoked gouda cheese. He enjoyed his food so much, he barely spoke throughout the meal! We will definitely be coming back.",

During the week I had no problem getting a table for about 6 people. They do not take reservations, so going on a weekend can be tricky. You can put your name in and wait at the bar. They do limit the number of people on the rooftop and there can be a long line at times (bummer!). They have a great cocktail list!  For food, I have only tried the meatballs and mac and cheese. Both are great! If you are there with multiple people, I recommend each getting your own order for (4) meatballs with a different sauce and sharing. I love the Parmesan one! Definitely check this place out! Even if you are not a fan of meatballs, they have a different rooftop app menu!",

At first I was a little disappointed in the lack of choices on the menu, until I realize that what they had, they did well. I tried for the five meatballs that they had that night along with the side and all were very good.

    "text": "Well that was different...a meatball joint. Now this is not necessarily an Italian thing but, I actually judge an Italian restaurant by their meatballs....that's how important they are to me. So it's almost not fair that I walked into a strictly meatball joint... because it's not an Italian restaurant making meatballs, it's a meatball joint making what they make. A little confusing, right? No harm done. The open front of the restaurant and tables practically outside called to me before I even figured out what this place was.  Well now, on my Meatball Meter, if this place was strictly an Italian restaurant, I would not have been impressed. The meatballs were better than good but not \"oh my god\". In all fairness, I only had the beef but you have a choice of 3 others including vegetarian, turkey and spicy pork. Perhaps pork next time.   I ordered the grinder and my wife and daughter ordered the sliders. I had beef with \"Sunday Gravy\" sauce (a marinara). The sauce is a second criterion I use and again it was better than good but not \"wow\". Understand that I am biased and make my own sauce. I like it salty and with a lot of basil. At the recommendation of our server, Taylor, I had chosen smoked gouda as the topper instead of provolone or american. This really tied the sandwich together and the bread was better than excellent on my scale, hearty, crisp outside and soft inside. The gouda saved the sandwich. My wife had the mushroom gravy on beef meatballs and she rather enjoyed it.  Salad was excellent, a balsamic vinegarette (chosen from 5 or so choices) which had a kick to it. Definitely delivered. It was over arugula with tomatoes, fresh mozz and sliced almonds. This was a wow salad. Some pene on the side perfectly al dente but with the Sunday gravy which was suitable. Just wish it was a little saltier.  Overall, the atmosphere, presentation, everything was a great experience and, though each quality would have been 3 or 4, the sum total scores a 4 overall for me. We would come back just for the ambiance. Prices not too shabby either. Just under $50 for 3 people including tax and tip.",

    "text": "Concept vs. execution. Love the idea of a meatball-specific establishment in downtown Pittsburgh, but can meatballs alone make it? Thank goodness two more floors are still set to open, each with their own focus. Not that the meatballs weren't good....they were good, just not great. Not enough to bring me back for anything but a quick lunch.  Speaking of execution, they have the style part down pat. My dining companion and I each ordered spicy pork meatballs because they were gluten-free once our server clued us in to that fact. Score! However, the menu says it's the chicken meatballs that are gluten-free - poor execution of the menu. I wasn't disappointed since the spicy pork meatballs sounded much more tempting! (Just fix the menu, please,before someone accidentally orders the chicken meatballs and suffers a reaction. I'd think it would be a pretty simple fix to place stickers on the menu until new menus are printed.)   Anyway, back to the balls. Great flavor, nice spice and heavy as a solid rubber ball. Still, I'd order them again....and not just because it's the only one on the menu that's gluten-free.  Sauces. I ordered my balls with the Sunday sauce and a side of tomato risotto. My dining partner had hers with the arabbiata sauce and a side of beans and greens. The presentation was quite nice for a dish of humble meatballs. A silver dish with 4 nice size meatballs carressed by a silken red sauce on top of my side dish of risotto. What? Wish I'd realized they automatically put your balls on top of your side. I'd prefer my risotto unadulterated, please. The sauce was decent, just not what I've ever considered Sunday sauce. Where was the meat? The risotto was okay, but for a tomato risotto I expected to be able to discern a nice sharp parm through the rice and tomato. Eh.  And my companion's? Her arabbiata was no different from my Sunday sauce except that possibly there was a smidge more heat. Maybe. Her beans & greens? They tasted like canned beans and boiled greens. Where were the deep, rich, garlicky, long-cooked flavors of good beans & greens? Nowhere to be found. Skip the beans & greens.  The cocktail list? Eh. Nothing tempting whatsoever. At least the bar was packed with young professionals checking each other out over their never empty glasses. Looks like a happening place for after work!  Bottom line? The space is nice. The cocktail list is boring. The food needs some serious improvement. BUT, I have hopes the execution of the menu will rise to meet the presentation and the surroundings. I'm looking forward to checking it out again in a month or so and being able to raise my rating. And please, execute the hell out of that cocktail list before my next visit? Thanks.",

    "text": "\"Hey, Jules, let's go somewhere different for lunch!  Why don't you pick?\" \"Did you say different?  I've got just the place!\"  Can you imagine the brains behind this new concept restaurant?  Let's serve meatballs.  Different sides.  Different sauces.  Let's make the joint trendy.  And this works.  The interior has lots of reclaimed wood, interesting light fixtures with vintage light bulbs, lots of modern metal chairs, comfortable booths and garage doors up front so when Spring finally does arrive, they can open this place up.  It's also a pretty good spot to watch a game.  Also, not sure why this is listed as Sienna Mercato.  Only Emporio is open so far.  So, I think it's going to be confusing when the other floors open with different names.  I would think each floor deserves it's own Yelp page.  Anyway, first off, our server was amazing.  We must have looked blank and stupid staring at the menu trying to make sense of it.  Of course, after she explained it, the menu makes sense.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  BJ was very happy because of all the beer choices on draft.  And we appreciate that.  BJ was first up.  He got the wedge salad and two of the sliders.  His picks were Classic Beef (grandma's secret) with arribiatta sauce.  And a Vegetarian (mushroom, white bean, cauliflower) with spinach-almond pesto sauce.  The arribiatta was thick and full of flavor.  Amazing.  And the pesto sauce was even better.  The balls are huge.  Two and 1/2 ounces.  Doesn't sound like much, but that's a lot.  The salad had tomato, chopped egg, pancetta, a nicely craved carrot, and crouton.  The blue cheese dressing was SO good!    I was being overly cautious with my order.  I simply got the Vegetable Minestrone soup and a ball.  The soup was very hearty, and consisted of tomato-fennel broth, carrot, onion, green beans, and kidney beans.  So good!  I got my meatball plain, I picked the Spicy Pork with chili pepper and herbs.  Perfect.  But I could not leave well enough alone, I had to copy the big guy and get a slider, too.  Funny how fast they can bring those balls out.  My second go round was yet another Spicy Pork, this one with the pork bolognese.  The slider buns are soft and delicious, the sauce was yum yum.  Needless to say, I was totally stuffed full, over my limit.  And had to miss out on dessert.  That's okay, because we are sure to come back soon!",

I visited the \"Meatball\" restaurant called Emporia on the first floor and the rooftop bar with a retractable roof on floor three, Il Trello.  Crowded but fun crowd.  Great service.  Third floor menu is really small and appetizers only.  It advertises bar food but you won't find a meal here.  Make sure you get your name on the list for Emporia or have reservations for Italian on the second floor if you are there for more than a few drinks and some buffalo dip and chips.  I was expecting wings or a burger in Il Trello.  Nope.  That said, the buffalo chicken dip was awesome.  Emporio was a surprise.  A meatball restaurant?  Absolute genius.  Meatballs included pork, beef, chicken, vegie and weekly special options.  Lots's of coices from pastas to paninis to bowls and large sauce and extras options.  The combinations are endless.  I had a spicy pork meatball grinder with alfredo sauce, parmesan and bacon bits at the waiter's recommendation.  Not the healthiest choice but darn good.  Half a sandwhich and I was full.  Fries are huge portions and should be shared.  I should have bought a t-shirt as they are quite amusing.  I highly recommend.",

We decided to eat on the floor where they served entrees (2nd or 3rd?) and it was a very nice setting. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. She asked us about food allergies and guided us on our selections. This place has high quality food, that's for sure. I'm a picky eater that doesn't like a lot of unique food variety, so I couldn't really appreciate everything they had to offer. That being said, the pizza I ordered (no peppers or onions) was some of the best flavored pizza I've ever had. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it was pricey (but you get what you pay for) and there was only one thing on the menu that i thought I would like.. turns out it was great though! They give you ginger cookies after your meal which was a super cute touch too. Thanks!",

Combine the balls with a solid tap list of craft beer, everyone was happy.   I opted for the ball of the month: turkey meatballs with mushroom gravy over mashed potatoes and corn.  There may have been cranberry in there too... OH EM GEE!!  Now THIS is a Thanksgiving feast!!    Who needs a thanksgiving dinner of dry turkey, canned cranberry, or cranky relatives when you can go to Empirio and order this amazing dish?!  The only thing that would make it better would be if I was enjoying it in my sweats while watching football... but I bet Empirio and I could work something out.   Oh ya - everyone else enjoyed their food, too.    Empirio and I are now in a relationship.  The hubs understands and is supportive of my desire to indulge in delicious meatballs... he even joins in!

    "text": "We had finished watching a show at Heinz Hall and all we wanted was carbs and brews.   The concept of a meatball joint was really neat. It was slightly overwhelming with the option of build your own, and I had a difficult time pairing type of meatball with the sauce and side. So I just went with signature bowl, Thats-spicy-Meat-a-Ball ($13). I liked the combination of the spicy pork balls with the spicy red sauce. The meatball portions were very generous and the meat wasn't tough at all considering the size of meatball. The dish was really filling taking into account that I came in famished. I wasn't a huge fan of the jalapenos that seemed to be just tossed in there though. I also might have not paired tortellini with a thick red sauce like that. My friends on the other-hand had really good build your own bowls. The chicken meatball was slightly tough but still flavorful. So lesson learned, don't feel the need be a culinary genius when it comes to build you own, just put what you like and have fun with it, chances are you'll end up liking it anyway!   Absolutely want to check out the roof top beer garden next time. Emporio was a fun place for a group of friends to catch up and grab a few beers!",

If I am only going for lunch I will stick to the panini or sliders, because the saucy balls is a lot of food.  They also have a meatball of the month which I usually like to try in slider form.  The best one I have ever had was the Buffalo chicken and I hope they bring it back eventually.  Aside from the good at sienna, there is a rooftop bar which is a great happy hour spot.",

    "text": "Its hit or miss.  We got off on the wrong foot with the wait. My cousin called ahead for a group of ten and on the phone was told an hour and fifteen minutes to an hour and a half. The text she got said 120 min, but after the time she was told on the phone she read that as an hour and 20 min. So after waiting 2 hours we went downstairs to see what was happening and after some hemming and hawing, there was a table after another 10 to 15 minutes.   (Notes to restaurant - after we complained you told us its hard to accommodate 10 people in your restaurant. From here on, please tell people that when they call. We have a dozen other places we could visit inside 2 blocks. Also, the words \"its only been 2 hours\" should never be said to a guest who has already waited 2 hours.)  Just based on that part of the experience, I won't plan to return. If I were walking by and saw it empty, I would pop in for sure. But that's the only way I'll go back.  Me and my man both had soup. His wedding soup was very good, just shy of great. It sparked a conversation about Granma's wedding soup, it was that good. My pasta fagioli was not. It was reminiscent of nights I'm pressed for time and make soup from canned stuff. A can of beans, a can of tomatoes, some ditalini, a can of broth, and sauteed onions and celery. The sauteed veggies were still crunchy, they weren't cooked through. After adding a ton of cholula hot sauce it was just ok. Soup was dropped at the table and the food runner vanished before we noticed there were no spoons.  I had veggie balls, he had beef meat balls. My veggie balls were FREAKING AMAZING. I got them with pesto over beans and greens. The greens were good, the beans were the same as in my soup. But the balls, fantastic. His meatballs over spaghetti had a Parmesan cream sauce he loved.  So the food - mostly a hit. The wait, not worth it. Catch them at a slow time, or spend your money someplace else.  Our server was nice and did the best you could hope with a big party of starving (mostly) Italians who REALLY wanted to eat.",

Hubby is a wonderful discerning cook. He was quite disappointed. His meatballs tasted mostly of bread and NOT beef and the creamy parmesan sauce was quite floury tasting with no actual parmesan flavor or taste. The water came in a nice jug but continued to have the wonderfully chlorinated smell and flavor of the city's tap. Not even a lemon to soften it. Thus, he could not wash the taste of his meal from his mouth prior to our concert.  I had the vegetable balls with a spinach-almond pesto sauce and the smoked gouda on panini. I'm not sure what the veggie ball tasted like. I have no clear recollection of flavor, but more of texture. The ball was not soggy but certainly had no firmness or structure. I have had an oily film in my mouth since.  The panini itself was not the traditional flattened sandwich but was half a toasted sausage bun cut in half length-wise. Not anywhere near our expectation of panini.  All in all a disappointing and from our perspective expensive experience. The salad was okay, though.",

I also think they are a bit too heavy-handed with garlic in their macaroni and cheese. Overall, I found their service level to be pretty good besides the gentleman that runs the door up in their open rooftop bar. The very first time I went up there to meet a bunch of work colleagues, I took the elevator and walked into the rooftop area. I had no clear indication or sign that I was suppose to wait right there before making my way inside. I immediately spotted my colleagues, and started walking toward them. However, I was suddenly jerked back by the door gentleman as he grabbed the back of my sweater collar and yanked me back to him and informed me that I should've waited for him to check my ID, etc. What the..?? At the time, I brushed this off but in hindsight it upset me pretty bad. I should have reported this incident to his manager at the time, but I honestly did not see any indications that I had to have my ID checked once the elevator doors opened (nor was this gentleman making any sort of immediate physical request for my ID). However, it seems that he thought it was appropriate to deliver a horse-collar on me in front of all the patrons and my work colleagues who I was walking towards. I haven't been back since, but I hope this gentleman hasn't continued this sort of unprofessional behavior because everyone else that works there seem to be extremely professional. And in case you are wondering -- no, I wasn't drunk, or copping an attitude, or leaving anything out. Like I said, it was my first time going up to their rooftop, the elevator doors opened, I spotted my friends, started walking their way, and then YANK.",

I strolled in as an obvious biz traveler - I think my branded polo blew my cover - and posted up at the bar. The atmosphere in here is a bit classy but the bar also gives off an inviting, more casual vibe. As soon as I bellied up, I asked for the Love Nitro Stout - I prefer Left Hand's over this one, but it was pretty good nonetheless.   My meal started with the rocket salad - arugula, almonds, tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella. The almonds add great texture and the mozz tasted fresh. Next, I got the vegetarian meatballs- yea that's a thing. Mushrooms, white beans, and cauliflower make up the mixture and it is goooood. I made my serving a panini with the almond, spinach pesto - wow! Finally I got ice cream for dessert. If they have black raspberry then I totally just made your decision for you.  Andrew at the bar was friendly and indulged me in a local culture lesson - sports, food, neighborhoods, districts, etc. If you're looking for laid back, casual, and sarcastic conversation then he's your dude.   Come here with plenty of time to spare - not an \"in and out\" kind of place. Hope you enjoy it!",

The lower level has gourmet meatball specialty items, second level is gourmet pizza and pastas and the third floor is called the roof top which has a bar/brewery atmosphere. We ate on the second level and ordered the Bruschetta del Giorno for our appetizer which was devine, Risotto Milanese with white wine, saffron and fava beans amd the Quattro Fromaggi pizza with mozzarella, house ricotta, fontina, parmesan, pickleld tomato and garlic. Each one of these dishes were just absolutely amazing in presentation and taste. To end the experience we order the  Peanut Butter Meringue Torte with peanut butter mousse, salted peanut meringue, oatmeal anglaise and pomegranate jelly. What made the night even more special was our waiter Tom, who met our every need and request to include a military discount by comping the Risotto and dessert.

I profess...I'm not a meatball fan but this place won me over almost immediately.    The way the menu works is you pick your meatball, your sauce, cheese and how you want it served.  My preference is the turkey meatball with the pesto sauce and Gouda cheese on the panini.  Normally, turkey meatballs are on the dry side but these are moist and flavorful!  With just two meatballs, the panini is the perfect size for lunch.  I also love the creamy parm and government cheese sauces.   There are a ton of great sides to order from too.  I love the mac and cheese and the tomato risotto.    The fries are tasty too but I think an order of those is big enough to share.   With vegetarian meatballs, spicy pork meatballs and salads, there are options for everyone.      They also have a wide varieties of craft beers to chose from and some decent wines.  The exposed brick and beams and the open front windows on a nice day, make the atmosphere delightful.   Overall, prices are reasonable if you keep the alcohol to a minimum.     Be sure to use the nowait app or you could be in for a long wait.",

The amount of juice and flavor that these meatballs soak up is incredible. I recommend the Saucy Balls Entree, where you'll get 4 equally sized tennis balls of meat glory. If I go Grandma's Beef, it's with the creamy parmesan sauce. Almost just as important as the balls is the appetizer. The poutine is a snack for all that you will come back for time and time again. I get the poutine with tots, mushroom gravy, PANCETTA, and a fried egg!",

    "text": "I have frequented Sienna Mercato/Emporio (meatballs) many times in the past, with good results and left happy enough. I've never really liked the prices they put on the food and I hate that there's no happy hour specials on the rooftop but there is on the first floor (what?). But regardless, the food is tasty and the idea behind the restaurant grouping is unique.  Anyway, went to lunch here with co-workers about a week and a half ago and left unhappy. First thing I noticed on arrival, across the board raise on prices. I get it, you need to occasionally raise prices if business is slowing or what not, but dang, they raised the prices. And I'm sorry but one meatball should not cost $3.50 in my personal opinion.   Second, I always order two meatballs on top of the tomato risotto. The risotto is always good, and I like the meatballs. But service here is sooo picky. I order a pork and beef meatball, and ask for it on top of risotto. Shouldn't be a problem, right? The meatballs come in individual metal serving bowls (annoying in their own right) and the risotto also separately. I question why they're not on top of the risotto in one of the big bowls (as I usually have had in the past), and he explains you have to get the same balls to get that. Okay fine, I remember I've order the same balls in the past and have gotten what I wanted, but where was the warning about that as I ordered my food and asked for the food as I wanted? So this is sounding really winy, I know. But then, I asked him to simply take the risotto, pour it into a big bowl, and throw the meatballs on top in one bigger bowl. He takes the food, comes back 3 minutes later, \"we can't do that\", and offers to bring me my own bowl to do it myself. Really? I decline, eat my food, and leave.  I've had questionable experiences with meatballs in the past, but I'm done with this place. I cannot handle cruddy service and ridiculous serving policies because the place wants to be \"fancy\" and \"hip\". And prices? $12+ for two meatballs a small bowl of risotto. Nope.",

    "text": "LOVE this place. Visited over the past weekend with a friend. We \"got in line\" using the No wait app - which I would highly recommend using (especially if visiting on the weekends). For two people there was an 80 minute wait for Emporio (the first floor, with the meatballs).   Since we had time we went to the third level (rooftop bar) for drinks while we waited. They have AWESOME  cocktails... Very unique, not your traditional rum and coke. The space has great ambiance, and is perfect for a summer/fall night.   The wait time was pretty accurate, but well worth it. We shared the Buffalo Chicken Balls as an appetizer - which are a must if you like buff chix. I had 1 spicy pork slider with creamy parm sauce. All were delicious. The fries were also bomb.   If in the city this place is a must. I have yet to try the 2nd floor - but plan on doing so in the near future.",

The only downside was that I wanted to eat vegetarian and ordered the vegetarian saucy balls, they were very mushy and not as crispy as I was hoping.  I was hoping for a crisper outside to make it a better texture but it all sort of squished apart. (Is that even a word!?)  I would definitely go back and try the other meatballs, however in my opinion if you're a vegetarian perhaps this is not the best option of places to eat. The rest of my vegetarian meal so delicious, I ordered a side of broccoli and got my saucy balls with the pesto, I did want to actually do shots of this stuff it was SO good!   All in all great experience and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Meat eaters and meatball lovers this is your place!",

The 1st bartender was too busy entertaining the preppy couple and the pack of young business guys nursing their drinks. Because of this, I planned to pay for my drink and find another place for dinner. Thankfully, a second bartender noticed my empty drink and came to my aid. Then the first bartender perked up and realized I was willing to spend some money. Anyway...  The beef meatballs were hohum but the marinara sauce was classic and great. My mixed drink was simple and tasty The bar stools are horribly uncomfortable  And at least 1 bartender needs to learn that some women travel for business, eat alone and tip well if you keep my drink full",

I don't believe that all the levels are open yet but we did get a chance to eat at Emporio.   Emporio's thing is meatballs and reminds me a bit of Franktuary in that they have a focus to their food and that food is meant to be ordered in multiples. Franktuary has their hotdogs and Emporio has it's Meatballs.   You can of course order other things other than meatballs but you can also add  meatballs to pretty much anything which is great fun as well.   The meatballs were very good and can be made with different ingredients and be accompanied by serval different sauce. So you pick your ball and your sauce and then your dish you want that sauce and meatballs to be placed in. I had the sliders and it was delicious.   I feel the sides were plenty big to share so don't go overboard ordering too many of them. Had the mac and cheese and it was delicious as well   Give it a go, it's a great place grab a bite if you are in the neighborhood.",

I sat at the bar (plenty of space) and ordered a Captain and Coke, a chicken parm meatball slider and the tater tots.   One slider and a side really was plenty of food and it was less than $10.   The meatball was tender and delicious and the bun was just enough - can't stand a slider that's all bun.   The tater tots were crisp and salty.   I spied on my neighbor's meal - a meatball sub with pesto and a side of mac and cheese - that's going to be my next order for sure.   Overall, a winner.  Not a big fan of the backless bar stools and the bar service was a tad slow (the place was packed though), but that's the only criticism that I could come up with.",

For a Tuesday night in downtown Pittsburgh, I was surprised at how crowed they were! Our seating was on Mezzo.  I have to say I was disappointed. We started with an appetizer of sausage and peppers. Although they were tasty, they were only Luke warm. And any good Italian knows that when you are eating something like this, you need bread to sop up the sauce! But that is another $3.00! ( which we did pay) The main course also was not hot when it was served. My husband got the meatball pizza special, and said the meatballs were bland. Refills for drinks was also slow.  One of our dinner mates ordered a second beer and was done with his panini before it ever arrived. Would I go back again ? Maybe in the summer when I could take advantage of the rooftop seating and view! After last nights experience I would give this place 21/2 stars.",

A friend had arranged to hold an after party for their wedding here. The guests (about 30 of us) got there around midnight and got some drinks in the upstairs beer garden while waiting for the bride and groom to arrive. When they arrived just before 1am and the general manager, Krista Koller, wouldn't let them in because they didn't have their IDs on them. It's the wedding day, and quite understandable that in the midst of everything they forgot to carry their IDs. Wedding dresses usually don't have pockets. Remember that this is the bride and groom - the couple that had organized to have their party here in the first place. Let alone the facts that this is their wedding day and that these individuals are clearly over 21 (two facts that by themselves any sensible, reasonable manager should consider), the fact that she refused to allow the people who organized the event to enter the event is insane! What kind of person is this? Sienna Mercato, you seem like a decent establishment, but if this is the kind of people you have running the place then forget it. There are tons of great places in Pittsburgh, and I'll go to the places that have reasonable human beings with at least some sense of decency running the show.  I mean, seriously...on their wedding day...really? REALLY? You're going to be that much of a jerk to a newly wed couple? What is wrong with you Krista Koller?",

Emporio's thing is meatballs. All kinds of meatballs. All kinds of ways. This is a really cool concept; however, I could see how this could get old and the menu could feel a bit limited.  The ambience is cool, with plenty of rustic elements to make it feel contemporary, yet warm and welcoming. I haven't been for dinner yet, but there are always plenty of tables at lunchtime, with or without a reservation.  There are a variety of meatball options (pork, turkey, vegetarian, beef), and there is always a special as well. You can get your meatballs saucy-style over pasta or quinoa, or another base of your choice, or you can get them in a soup (I would recommend the wedding), on a slider, in a grinder, etc. There are lots of sauce options so you can really mix things up if you like. My favorite sauces are the tzatziki, Sunday gravy, and the government cheese.    One of my favorite things on the menu is the mac and cheese. I get it with the government cheese, but i'm sure the creamy parmesan option is delicious as well. It's really delicious, and the perfect accompaniment to the port meatball with tzatziki sauce. Yum!! The fries are really good as well, and are plenty big enough to share.  All in all, this is a great place to go for lunch before a Buccos game or a concert. Easy to get in and out, and plenty casual.",

The atmosphere was cool, the beer choices were plentiful, and the food was amazing. As an appetizer we shared the fried pickles with bacon ranch dip. I wasn't expecting to like them but I couldn't keep my hands out of the bowl, they were delicious. I had a bowl of pasta fagioli as well, which was entirely unnecessary but pretty good. We both got poutine topped with spicy pork meatballs and mushroom gravy as our entree, and that was enough for us to decide we would be coming back. Best meatballs I've ever eaten, and the first time I've ever eaten poutine, so the bar is set pretty high for any future poutine ventures. We ordered the ricotta doughnuts for dessert; they were super soft inside, lightly crisp on the outside, covered in powdered sugar with a side of fudge. Overall our experience was fantastic and we will definitely be coming back! We are both interested in trying out the beer garden next time too!",

My favorite being the spicy pork with a creamy Parmesan sauce over top. It is a simple concept that puts the balls in your court (never gets old). Also I recommend adding a vegetable to any of the meatballs you get. I got the tomato risotto, that was out of this world! Definitely a place to hit up if you are ever in the burgh' plus come this summer, there will be a roof top beer garden/bar to enjoy along with your meatballs! What more could you ask for?",

I also love the cups they have for your water and I know that is an odd thing to say, but they are awesome.   We ordered the buffalo balls for an appetizer and the presentation was spot on and the flavor was equally great. I ordered the Spicy Pork Meatballs, Spinach Almond Pesto Grinder with cheddar cheese and it was DELICIOUS! My date ordered the Regular Meatballs with spicy marinara Grinder. He graciously shared a bite with me and it was equally as delicious.   The service was a little slow and that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. I am sure after time, or at least I hope, that their service will get better with time since this place is brand new.",

On the second floor we chose the charcuterie and cheese board, the beef pasta and the pork and pistachio pizza, all very good. We loved the option of a three ounce pour of wine, gave us the chance to pick multiple wines throughout dinner. The chocolate dessert was one of my favorites in pittsburgh, major kudos to the pasty chef on flavor and presentation. Our waitress was attentive, the atmosphere was nice also. Didn't make it to the meatball floor, it was buzzing with what seemed to be a more family oriented crowd. All and all, we had a wonderful date night, thanks y'all!",

I assumed they'd give something like a Trader Joe's microwaveable Kung pao chicken. It definitely tasted like it was cooked in a pan/grill. That was a pleasant surprise. Super tasty. Definitely recommend. I got my beer and check fairly quickly despite it being so busy. My only complaint is the cost. One beer and one dish cost $17. With tip $19. Very expensive. Probably not returning for that reason, and why I only gave it 4 stars. Otherwise if you can spend anything you want, come here and you'll get tasty beer and food.",

My girlfriend and I ate down at the emporio, which is the ground floor level that specializes in meatball dishes. You choose the type of meat (ground turkey, beef, spicy pork, vegetarian,etc). The beef and turkey are good but a clear backseat to the spicy pork which is out of this world. Then you choose the sauces, all of them which are good, personally I find the arabiatta to be the best. Then you choose what kind of meal you want (panini, hero-hoagie-grinder, bun, or just in a bowl). The servers are friendly and accommodating, and the food orders come out hot and quickly. After we enjoyed a few rounds of meatballs we took the elevator in the back up to the rooftop to grab a few drinks and enjoy the view. I find it to be one of the better views in the city. The bartenders upstairs are just as friendly and helpful as the servers downstairs. If you're traveling to Pittsburgh, definitely make this a stop on your list!",

Those tend to be dense, and not dense as in containing a lot of filler.  The drinks were strong. You could have the poutine in several varieties, including \"not really poutine,\" i.e., with tater tots (because NO). I tried the chicken parmesan meatballs featured in the Angry Birds menu offering, mostly because I'd never had those types of meatballs before... it was worth it. It does get a bit loud in there too.

I had the meatball of the month which is a Jambalaya meatball with pork sausage and shrimp served over gumbo.  Let me tell you, it was the best meatball I have had.  I do enjoy cajun food so this will have a lot to do with it but it was so good.  Also, the service was so good.  This is why I keep coming back because they are always friendly and attentive and of course the meatballs.  So, if you plan on going here this month get the meatball of the month and you will not be disappointed.",

Although it can get loud, the deals are great, the wait staff is fast and friendly, and everyone always enjoys themselves. I have to say, Sienna Mercato is not light handed when it comes to their drinks (which is a good thing!). Two Froze Roses will definitely do the trick. Also, I want to add that the appetizers are delicious, but the pretzel takes the cake. For $5 dollars, you can get two huge, dense pretzels with some of the best beer cheese you've ever had. I 100% recommend Sienna Mercato to anyone, and I can't wait to try out the other levels (Emporio & Mezzo).",

    "text": "I came here for an event that was on the third floor. I've never been to the third floor and I just assumed they would be just as great as the first floor. I was a little bit disappointed but I don't know if maybe the event was just poorly planned and I don't really want to blame the third floor.  The food was amazing, the staff was really good too, and the drinks were not awful. I started out ordering a peach Frozen drink but the waitress came over with the rose and asked if it would be okay if she gave me that instead since the peach was out. I kind of felt weird say no since she already had the drink poured and in her hand, but I'm sure that I could have refused it and it wouldn't have been that big of deal. And quite frankly that drink was delicious. I will definitely go for that one the next time that I'm there. So even though there was a little bit of a mix-up I'm glad that it worked out.  Since we were there for an event and larger party was going to be coming I decide to order every appetizer on the menu because I was the only one there during the happy hour specials. So my reviews of those appetizers would be that number one those cajun fries are delicious. It is really hard to mess up fries but it can be done, and I was really happy to see that they were very crispy and not too overly seasoned. Nothing makes me sadder than salty fries that are inedible.   Number two however they made that curried carrot hummus with the arugula pesto dang get me another order. I was pleasantly surprised and how good this was. Don't get me wrong it was really weird but still it was really really good. I even suggested it to the table next to us when they were thinking about getting snacks. It was slightly sweet yet an interesting taste.  The baked brie was okay. Nothing to really write home about. I think it could have been cooked a little longer because it wasn't really gooey gooey it was just kind of warm.  The pretzel logs were awesome too. The cheese was a little off and in the middle of the pretzels they were kind of a little bit doughy. I would get them again but if I had a choice between the pretzels and that arugula dip it would be a toss-up.  I did not like the crab dip. It had very little flavor to it and it tasted too much like fake crab. And I'm not opposed to a fake crab dip but it just has to be seasoned a little bit more than this was.  So at the end of the night when we tried to pay we got our bill and we wrote down what each of our names were associated with how much we were paying. When the waitress came back she said that we still owed about $13. That was really confusing considering that we added everything up. It turned out that they added some vodka drinks to our bill after we were done paying. Thank goodness we kept that original sheet with no vodka on it because they wanted proof that that we did not drink the vodka. It was a little bit odd and kind of off-putting but we got through it after we produce the receipt. The waitress that came around just said that the manager wanted to make sure the receipt didn't have it on before we could leave. I don't know if that was the truth or not but I did feel bad for her, just because she was helping out the waitress who was actually waiting on us was caught up with a large table who came in.  And while I know that this is not the third floor is fault it gets super loud in there when they close the Rooftop. It was starting to sprinkle a little and so they close the roof but that made it so sticky underneath that glass. Had I known that it was going to rain I probably would have picked a different floor. But again not really their fault that it rained. I just wish that they would have pumped a little bit more AC once they close that ceiling.  Because of that little weirdness at the end with the receipt I have to go with three stars. Possibly the next time I can bump it up to another one but we'll see.",

I was surprised at how good the specials were. Basically everything was only $5 plus half off apps. It was really crowded since it was a nice Friday happy hour, but the staff was still extremely attentive. The last time I was there I had a frose which was a little too sweet for my liking. So this time I got a gin and tonic which hit the spot! Once happy hour ended we went downstairs for some meatballs. I'm always a big fan of their variety of things you can do with meatballs. This time I ordered the Angry Birds bowl. Delicious! It had chicken meatballs on top of Mac and cheese with their crack sauce (buffalo sauce and ranch) topped with blue cheese. Right up my alley! It was the perfect spice level. Everything mixed together really well. My one friend had the chicken pesto and loved it! The Brussels sprouts and risotto is supposed to be fab as well. Our server was wonderful as well, even though I unfortunately forget his name.",

Sprinkle in their racist bartender Joshua and the place is 0 stars but yelp only lets you go to 1. While there were other groups at the same location who were clearly intoxicated and drinking much heavier than my friends and I, Joshua took it upon himself to let the only people of color in the bar know that they had been cut off and that they were being kicked out. When we talk to the management they said that Joshua told them a member of our party took three shots in a row, to which we replied he ordered three shots for himself and two other individuals and that they could check the security tapes to verify. The manager on duty let us know that the cameras are not working and apologized for any inconvenience. When we walked outside the bouncer asked what happened and the security guard who was escorting us out shrugged and said I don't know. We even asked the security guard who was escorting us out if we were being obnoxious rude disrespectful or overly intoxicated and he agreed that we were not. It's a shame that they let a party of 16 walk out, that's at least $1,600 they lost, because a bartender was having a bad night. I would highly recommend going to anywhere else because you will receive much better customer service, feel safe with working cameras, and not be supporting a business that clearly employees individuals who hate my minority groups.",

    "text": "Sienna Mercato has really great specials for happy hour! They also serve a poutine that is on par with some places in Toronto. I'm also impressed by their selection of draft beers -- I was excited to find that they sometimes feature the watermelon beer from 21st Amendment.   The meatballs, however, are a bit dry and poorly seasoned. They are also soaked in sauces that taste excessively sour and sweet. In fact, it is often hard to discern one type of meatball from another. I've tried their meatballs in a salad, on a sandwich, or by themselves and I can't say that I look forward to eating them.  Although it's a great place to grab a drink in downtown, I wouldn't recommend having a meal here.",

For those of you don't know in order to access to the third floor (Beer Garden) you have to take the elevator.  There are stairs but only for staff use.  If t's a Friday or Saturday night you have to wait in line. No kidding! I visited over the weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday and spent the majority of the evening waiting in line to take the elevator.   I have no problem going up and down stairs but waiting in line for an elevator this is not how I prefer to spend my evening.  I saw a sign in the elevator that they need to monitor the person count on the 3rd floor or something!?  When it was time to leave.. I just wanted to go ..but again I had to wait in line to take the elevator downstairs.    I felt completely trapped. What if there is a fire or god forbid some other type of disaster!?Will everyone know where the stairs are located?!    If I visit again.. staying put on the first floor.",

    "text": "Emporio is always a great experience. Honestly, I come to this restaurant because the food is good but the inside is great! When it's warmer out, the wall closest to Penn is open to view the outdoors. The inside has this cool urban vibe that's good to experience after a long day at work or if you have friends visiting the city from out of town. It's got that \"wow\" factor that's good for those visiting guests.   The food itself is good albeit a touch overpriced in my book. But, you can order different varieties of meatballs and sauces and sides. Probably expect to pay around $40 for 2 people when coming here. Although the meals aren't huge, I will say, they are filling. My wife and I often each get the meatball panini and two sides. That's a good meal option. We like the mac and cheese and the broccoli for sides. Definitely get the mac and cheese. Broccoli . . . Who messes that up? Really? No one. So, it's good.   The waiters are nice but the pace is quick. I like that the quick pace but others may be overwhelmed by it. The waiters are always willing and great to answer questions, though. So, don't panic.   Want a great place to eat in the city that's unique, filled with great vibes and energy, and won't break the bank? Sienna Mercato's Emporio is a terrific option!",

We visited \"Mezzo\" the second floor of the restaurant, which mainly has Italian dishes like pizza, pasta and paninis. The first floor is a meatball joint and the third floor is a beer rooftop garden. We were quickly seated as we had already made a reservation.  The waitress was so attentive, and she explained to us the menu thoroughly. I started with the riesling, which was smooth and sweet. For the entree, I had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo which was a spicy red sauce, orecchiette pasta and fresh shrimp. My dining partner had the vegetable panini, which I grabbed a bite out of, and I found that to be really good with fresh vegetables, pesto sauce and mozzarella cheese. I loved the atmosphere of this place, which was casual yet a little hip! I would love to go back and try the other levels in this restaurant as well!",

Poutine was top notch, fresh fries, melty perfect cheese curds, and delicious gravy. However, the meatball was a little dry and didn't have much flavor.

    "text": "I have a hard time coming up with something that I don't like about this place.   Sienna Mercato is a three concept restaurant with Emporio on the ground floor and has been opened the longest, Mezzo is fine dining and is not yet open, and Il Tetto is the rooftop beer garden.   Emporio is a great meatball joint. The whole idea is great. Simple menu, low price point, and good drinks. You choose the type of meatball, the type of sauce, and how you want it served. Saucy Balls tends to be my go-to : Four balls covered in sauce. For $4 extra dollars, you can get the balls served over the side of your choice. The tomato risotto is delish. I recently had 2 balls on a panini and YUM! The texture of the crispy bread, cheese, and smashed meatballs was the perfect combo. The parm herb fries came in a MASSIVE portion, covered in parm cheese, and perfectly crispy. Be sure to start the meal off with a strong drink and some pickle chips. It is all so good! The exposed brick and rustic wood works well with the dark lighting and the huge front window that opens up for nice weather days.   Be sure to use the NoWait app to get your table, because you could be waiting for quite awhile. If you do get stuck waiting, check out Il Tetto, the rooftop beer garden. Go to the back of emporio to use the elevator to take you up to the third floor. The retractable glass ceiling gives the perfect balance for the unpredictable Pittsburgh weather. At night, the lights strung overhead make for a great atmosphere. It would be a great place for a date, but it also gets pretty crowded.   Get there fast and stuff balls in your face.",

Man, am I glad I didn't have a meatball starter and saved room for dinner. I was tempted though because those meatballs smell delicious!  And they had gluten-free turkey meatballs! We had dinner in the 2nd floor. Same interior with exposed brick. Not a lot of soft surfaces so the noise level is loud on both floors.  Wood seating around. I had the butternut risotto at the pretty server's suggestion. The  1/2 portion was plenty! I had the pork with polenta very good, cooked perfectly. I also had the mixed green salad with the candied pecans with a lite vinegar dressing and blue cheese. All my dinner was excellent. I really enjoyed the Melbec wine I had. I had a gluten intolerance which the waitress had no problem helping me with. There was really no GF desserts which was fine because I was full even though I went splitzy on my dinner with my daughter. My pal had the pork risotto, not as good as mine. It was kind of heavy seasoning with thyme sage ...  Another person had the pizza which I heard no complaints. Another in our party got the escarole salad, he seemed to enjoy.  Total check for two with wine around $100 I would like to check out the beer garden on the roof level - it looks pretty from the outside and it was open which is great as its November but the temp is in the 60s",

    "text": "Been in Pittsburgh for a year and while I've walked by Mercato 2-3 times a week, it's always been packed and they don't take reservations.  This week, we were able to go in and get a table for six with no wait.  Appetizers - Pepperoni Fritters, Mushrooms, Fried Chicken Balls, French Fries.  All great!  The Chicken Balls were probably my favorite, though we ordered more fries too.  Dinner - I got the Saucy Balls, which is four meatballs (I picked Spicy Pork, though they also have beef, turkey and vegetable) with Creamy Parmasen sauce (there is a variety of sauces available).  Very good, and a great deal for $11.  For an additional $4, they will serve them over the side of your choice (e.g. risotto, mac & cheese, fries, broccoli, etc.).  That's the only non-bread choice....if you want to get only 1 ball, it comes as a slider; 2 as a panini, 3 as a hoagie...but you can order any of those without bread, but they won't add melted cheese.    Good draught beer selection as well.  Dessert was a pecan ball...basically a scoop of vanilla ice cream covered in pecans and served with hot fudge.  As amazing as it sounds.  Three per order.  I think there are three levels here, and each is different.  My colleague went to the 2nd level and said it was an Italian restaurant.  What I'm describing was on the main floor.  As I mentioned, it's usually busy, especially after work.  Seemed to be that the later you go, the less crowded it it.",

    "text": "Birthdays  have always been a week-long celebration in my life. Yes, that means I am blessed (and appreciate it) and get to eat lots of good food while catching  up with loved ones.   Sienna Mercato is located Downtown Pittsburgh slightly north of the Cultural District. My aunt and I enjoyed beer (my last for 31 days) and each ordered a la carte meatballs (2 pesto, 2 marinara) and also enjoyed the Poutine (potatoes with cheese). Though all tasty, this experience felt more like a quick business lunch more than a celebratory birthday dinner. We were seated at a wobbly table in the center of the restaurant when many more intimate options were available. I'm not being passive-aggressive, just honest about the \"experience.\" The highlight was a shared order of pecan balls that were sooooo delicious (a bit frozen, so obviously pre made).   In the end, I would never go here for a date or dinner, but definitely on the run in a tight timeframe while conducting business Monday-Friday. It would also be a great start prior to a sports game or concert.   Attendees beware: the beer garden on the top floor (complete with a revolving glass roof) is only open Wednesday-Saturday. I'm sure that will change as the demand increases. Just FYI. Thanks to Aunt Joan for a lovely night on the town to celebrate Matthew's Eve!",

    "text": "I think this place is massively over-hyped. The food, while not bad, was far from exceptional considering there is a sole focus...and I have no plans to return.  Also, I went with Darren. That dude is great.   Things we tried:   1.) Poutine with gravy on fries. -Fries were as average as you can get, nothing about the gravy or curds stood out. Really lacking in the salt dept.  2.) Arancini (mushroom) w/ truffle aioli. -A shadow of previous incarnations of arancini I have had in my day. These were tiny and not exceptionally flavorful. I liked eating them but they left so much to be desired.  Also, I am sick of truffle aioli. It's like the sriracha of mayo-y dipping sauces and I wish people could make an effort to be more creative.  3.) Spicy Pork, Classic, and Corned Beef meatballs in various sandwich forms. -Look guys, if you're going to focus on something..hit it out of the park. Am I biased? Sure. I've been to <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/salumi-artisan-cured-meats-seattle-2\">yelp.com/biz/salumi-arti...</a> and these are the best meatballs I have ever had. None of what I had at Mercato was bad persay, but I would never suggest to anyone that these were anything above a typical meat concoction. They are overcooked in the sense that they are cooked a bit above a temp that retains moisture. Though not dry, the texture did leave a bit over a bit to be desired.  If you're going to head downtown and pay for parking (see below) to eat at a trendy place, it has to excel. It has to wow you. It has to make you feel like it was worth the trip. To me, this was not a place I'd go out of my way to try again.  (A final kicker, there was Valet parking across the street for this place. When I picked up my car, I was *then* informed that it was $10. That's a tad bit shady, seeing as most places would..you know..advertise the price on the sign...I assumed it was complimentary parking)",

    "text": "EMPORIO!!! It sounds like a spell from Harry Potter and the actual place is just as magical.  The meatballs are good, really good, really really good.  The sides are also amazing.  My boyfriend, who doesn't eat cheese, came back for seconds on their creamy parmesan mac and cheese.  We always go at least once a month to see what their meatball of the month is.  Their corned beef meatball and stuffed pepper meatball are two of my favorite specialty ones and their spicy pork meatball is always my go to when i'm there.  Spicy pork meatball with their basil pesto...yes...just try it...yes. I have not had one bad thing to eat here and the service has always been great.  We like to go for happy hour before the place gets too packed and that is also a great time.  Half off drafts with a very varied draft list that still always has a few staples on there as well. Once I'm all filled up on meatballs the upper deck is just a great place to relax with friends.  It's so open and a gorgeous downtown spot. I have not tried the second floor yet but if it's even half as good as the first and third floor I'm guessing it's pretty great.",

Food is fantastic, service is fantastic, atmosphere is classy but not too uppity. I have had a drink on the rooftop bar, and it's the best rooftop that I have been too thus far in Pittsburgh. I've been to the Meatball Shop in NYC, and Sienna Mercato has them beat easily.",

The meat ball of the month I think was bacon cheddar, yea sounds weird, but the way it was described it made my mouth water. I got the spicy pork meat balls on a panini and they were delicious!",

If we did not want those seats it would have been at least another 1/2 hour.  So we decided to sit there (this was supposed to be our family Easter dinner).  Once seated we ordered, we were not able to add or omit anything from the dishes we had ordered.   Our girls wanted garlic added to pizza and they wouldn't do it.  Another person in our party couldn't have cheese and they refused to omit it from the risotto.  Finally, my dinner selection was a pork chop that was on special.  They ended up running out of the pork chop and wanted to replace it with a pork belly (with the skin left on).  Needless to say, we ended up going without dinner as we canceled the entire order and left. I would definitely not recommend this place.",

The whole menu looked good & I liked that you had the option of ordering half portions of the pastas/risottos. The pizza options were creative & I settled on the Tartufo. Wasn't exactly what I envisioned based on the description, but it was yummy nonetheless.  Was bummed that they didn't offer any draught beer options, even though they have plenty downstairs...don't think it would be that tough for servers to run down to grab a pint, but they may beg to differ. Pizza & beer go well together, so it would've been nice to have more of a selection than the few bottles & cans on offer (although I'll admit the small selection was diverse).  Service was so-so. It wasn't very busy, yet our beers took a surprising amount of time to arrive. Our server repeatedly forgot to bring things we'd requested...red pepper flakes, extra napkins, a glass of water, another round of beer. The hostess also kept seating people right on top of us despite the fact that the restaurant was pretty empty. Not sure why we needed to be surrounded by people on all sides while the rest of the place was wide open.  Definitely want to check out the rooftop next time!",

The majority of the dishes revolve around the wonder that is a meatball!  It is almost like you are building a Lego set as you follow the step by step directions in the menu and then they are properly reinforced by the server: 1. Select your meatball...(4 or 5 different flavorful blends).  Be sure to be on the lookout for the Daily Meatball, which is what I selected at the recommendation of our sever.  The \"Daily\" on my particular visit was the hot sausage. 2. Select your Sauce... 8 or so different sauces to choose from.   I found the Parmesan to be quite delightful. 3. Serving Options...  Sliders, Grinder, Panini or just straight balls and sauce.  I opted for the panini style and it did not disappoint.  The food menu may not be that diverse but SM makes up for it with a fantastic beer list.  A great selection of tap handles with the crafts of Pittsburgh well represented.  I went for Fat Head's Bumbleberry Honey Blueberry Ale and it was darn good!  This is a simple one and a trend that I have observed at more and more restaurants but SM keeps a bottle filled with fresh water on the table.  This is a nice touch and one that is well appreciated by this diner.  Service was on point and not too pricey.  I am throwing my endorsement behind this one.",

    "text": "Mezzo: This \"Middle\" Floor Eatery Tops My Downtown Restaurant List  My voice is starting to strain from singing the praises of Matthew Porco!  This 2010 Chef of the Year is ensuring that Mezzo, the newly opened second floor eatery of Sienna Mercato, is sending delectable food to your table without the usual new-opening indigestion.  And he's not just leading his culinary team behind those swinging kitchen doors either.  He's the bearded fellow who has been manning the wood-fired pizza/prep station since opening day.  If you're lucky enough to sit at the bar, you can watch him perform the dance of the pizzas while he rotates gourmet pies among the flames, as this seating area has no obstructed viewing.   Although my favorite seat in practically any eatery I patron is that of a barstool, I want to give Mezzo's dining area some much-deserved love, too. The sleek table settings and hardwood floors are softly illuminated with cascading Edison bulbs.  And Sienna's staple of open-air dining is maintained with retractable garage-style windows that let you take in the views on Penn Avenue when the weather cooperates.  What I'm trying to say here is that Mezzo is stylish...romantic...teetering on sexy even.  The only thing more appealing than how Mezzo looks, is what you get to put in your mouth while you ogle the place.  Yes, the pizza is downright superb as I alluded to earlier.  Chef Porco has taken the idea of gourmet pizzas to an even higher level.  We have had the pleasure of trying a few pies.  The Picante Salami and Peppers had a hearty, robust tomato sauce that was kicked up a notch with the addition of chili flakes and banana peppers.  The one that I will be comparing all other pies to from now until further notice, however, is the Pistachio and Porchetta.  I literally just stopped writing because I was trying to relive the consumption of that pie in my mind.  In place of tomato sauce, a foundation of pistachio pesto was generously applied and then blanketed with tender slices of porchetta (pork roast) dusted with fennel pollen.  This would be a party in your mouth as it is, but then they top the piping hot mozzarella with fresh arugula dressed in a citrus-based vinaigrette.  There are no words left to say...just go get one.  Okay, enough pizza chitchat...on to to other eats.  So when combining everything we've ordered in our visits since Mezzo's very recent opening, I've had the privilege of trying maybe ten different menu items.  (Jeeealous!)  Literally, everything I've tried has been pleasing to the eyes and palate.  Starting with drinks, my Manhattans have been expertly crafted.  You may also want to try some vino from their growing wine list.  You really can't go wrong either way.  While you imbibe, you need to order up some appetizers.  I equally loved the Grilled Octopus and the Greens and Beans.  The medley of al dente white beans and roasted red peppers made the octopus dish light, yet filling enough to appease my growing hunger pangs.  The greens and beans were savory to say the least.  Rich, somewhat briny broth played perfectly with the spiciness of the crumbled sausage that enriched every bite.   Some other pre-entree items worth ordering are the Little Gems salad and the charcuterie board.  A basic Caesar salad was elevated to gourmet status by using imported anchovies to not only create a flavor-punching vinaigrette but to also adorn the baby romaine hearts.  If you've written off anchovies because you recall them being dark, bony, morsels of dankness, give them another go.  These lil' guys are the real deal and will change your outlook on life...or maybe just your opinion of tiny fish.  The chef selected charcuterie board on the other hand...

    "text": "Came here with a party of 10 people on a Saturday night, ended up being an hour-ish wait after we decided to split onto 2 tables of 5. Our group of five ended up ordering each kind of meatball (minus the vegetarian because who would go for that if they buy a meaty dish?) along with two poutines (house cut fries and tater tots) and a crab balls appetizer. As for the meatballs, I found them to be alright. Was originally intrigued by the concept of it, but to be honest I found it slightly overrated in reality. My classic beef meatballs ended up being a little on the dry side ... I would have appreciated it if it was a little more tender. My favorite kind of meatball ended up being the spicy pork one ... not only tender enough to be minimally satisfying, but I did like the spicy kick since it definitely added to what would otherwise be pretty standard tasting meatballs. As for the sauce choices that you can get with the meatballs themselves ... my favorite would probably be the marinara. I found the arribiatta to be a little too salty and the spiciness (although I found it not to be that spicy at all) only exacerbated the saltiness of the sauce. As for the poutines, the tater tots with the cheese curds and gravy were delicious. Mozzarella cheese was perfectly melted (not too cold or squishy) and the tater tots along with the gravy and cheese made for a wonderful blend of taste in each bite with the cheese helping to moderate the saltiness of the dish. The fries were your standard fare of fries. As for the crab balls appetizer, I found them to be just average. Overall ... it was okay. I'm not really sold on the meatballs as the main course ... it left a little something more to be desired. They do have two other levels though ... the second floor for meat charcuterie and the third being a rooftop beer garden.",

    "text": "Overall our group was very disappointed when trying Mezzo.  A majority of us had tried Emporio and Il Tetto prior to trying Mezzo.  It reminded me of a butcher in the rye that has BAD pizza and a limited drink menu. We waited 2 hours to be seated so we grabbed drinks at il Tetto.   Service  The service was very subpar, which I was surprised to see all of the great reviews regarding service on Yelp. The waitress had an attitude and everyone at our table noticed.  The food runners provided better service than the actual waitress. I believe she asked our table maybe once or twice for refill of drinks. Our group had to ask multiple times for refills of water.  Atmosphere  A very small space- Do not go with large groups.  The decor reminded me of Butcher and The Rye.  The music is very loud so the waiters/waitresses have to scream over top of it when trying to explain the menu.  This place feels very out place in between the other two floors as it I felt like they were trying to make it more formal than the other floors.  The drink menu is very limited so do not expect to get the same drinks that you were getting at Ill Tetto.   Food  Our group ordered a variety of different pizzas and a few appetizers. The appetizers were not bad but thought they were a little pricey for what they were offering.  Honestly, this was probably some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  The sauce is not very good.  A few of the pizzas were extremely salty and everyone in our group noticed this. There were 8 of us in the group and not one of us were impressed.  You cannot take anything off any of their pizzas and can add a few listed items to them. I've never tried the location in market square so I cannot compare, but I obviously compared it to il pizzaiolo which is on an entirely different level than Mezzo.  The cookies at the end might have been the best part of our meal.",

Atmosphere is very cool however the food is not nor is the service.    My wife and I went to this restaurant on a suggestion from the concierge at our hotel.  We asked for a table near a sporting event we wanted to watch and the hostess told us \"to find a place and let them know\".  We found a great spot, I put my jacket in the booth and my wife sat down while I returned to tell the hostess where we were seated.  As I return my wife is leaving the table and informed me the other hostess did not say a word to her just shook her head no as to say you cannot sit here.     For some reason we decided to stay and I really wished would not have.  After reviewing a basics offering of items we decided on the saucy balls and asked for two options of meatballs which we were swiftly told you cannot mix your balls?!?!  Instead we opted for the bolognese sauce with spaghetti which came out in stainless steel bowls that resembled something you would use to feed your dog.  The beef balls were great the bolognese and the pork balls not so much.  We also ordered salads which we never saw, I took two bites of my entree and pushed it aside (I normally eat everything).   The server did not offer another option nor did he offer to take it off my bill.  Two beers 6 oz of pasta with two meet balls for $40 does not seem appropriate.  I travel all over the country for work and have experienced my fare share of poor and great food.  However in all my experiences I have not been compelled to wright a review until I found this place.  PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO ELSEWHERE!!!",

The menu is basic - fresh salads, a few apps with punch, solid starchy sides, and vegetarian - turkey - ground meat or pork meatballs in addition, one wowzer meatball feature of the day. The sauce and soups are not salty. The prices are fair.  The hosts/hostesses are kind of funny the way they guard the booths - but whatever.

    "text": "After anticipating the opening of Sienna Mercato's more refined, middle floor for months, Mezzo's food, atmosphere, and service greatly surpassed expectations.   To start, we ordered a bottle of wine and the greens and beans. The appetizer was average, but next time I think I'll go for the grilled octopus or split a charcuterie board. The overall vibe of the place encourages sharing, so for our main dishes we split a risotto dish and the tartufo pizza. I'm always a fan of risotto and it didn't disappoint. The pizza was topped with mushrooms, truffles, a medley of cheeses and an egg; probably the most unique pizza on the menu, but still nothing too exotic. My only complaint for the pizza, is that I would have preferred the egg to be over easy as opposed to scrambled.   While I was definitely satisfied, but not extremely overwhelmed with my food, it's really the atmosphere and set-up of the entire Sienna Mercato is really what makes it stand out in downtown Pittsburgh. Mezzo's interior boasts beautiful exposed brick, charming wall art, and high ceilings with floor to ceiling windows to match.  The combined three levels of Sienna Mercato fill a void in downtown Pittsburgh and turn Sienna Mercato into a destination, not just a restaurant. Prior to our dinner, we were able to grab drinks on the third floor while we waited and having a rooftop beer garden adds major value to the place, even when the roof is covered.   Classy enough for date nights, but casual enough for dinner with friends.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite place to grab a drink and dinner downtown. Emporio is a welcome addition to the Cultural District.   Let's start with my favorite part--the draft list. Emporio boasts an excellent draft list, with an ever-changing list of local and distant breweries. On my last trip, I grabbed a Southern Tier 2X IPA. Good thing I wasn't driving. The draft and drink list is very reasonable, especially for being a trendy new spot downtown.   The food menu is perfect for sharing and munching. The spot is known for its meatballs, and you can choose from many different sauces, meats, and presentations. I'm liable to make some kind of Frankenstein meal when left to mix and match on my own, but the servers are so helpful with recommendations. Each visit, I've deferred to them and had such a great meal.   Beyond the meatballs are other great dishes for sharing. I am a big fan of the buffalo chicken balls. It sounds fairly nasty to me, but these deep fried, deconstructed buffalo chicken balls are fantastic. They come with a blue cheese sauce, and spiral-ized celery. It's a wonderful take on a bar classic, and much of the menu trends in that direction.   While it's a trendy spot, I've never had an issue walking in and getting a table at Emporio. I understand the restaurant  doesn't take reservations, but if you're worried, sign up with NoWait to get on the list before you arrive.    There are a ton of great places to eat before or after a show in the Cultural District, and I'd add this one to the top of the roster. I think you'd even catch me going Downtown specifically for this place!",

    "text": "Came here with the fiance for a nice dinner out. We decided on Emporio as we both had been dying to try the famous meatballs and sauces. This time I was smart about my my wait and used the No Wait app on my phone to get us checked in. Once we arrived at Emporio we still had about a 35 minute wait, so we headed up to the beer garden and had some drinks, it was fairly quick half hour! Be sure you are timing this place right on any given weekend and put yourself in line long before you leave the house, it really was much better than my last experience with Mezzo.   For dinner we went all out! We started with the pepperoni and cheese bites with house marinara for dipping. These were delish! Fried crispy on the outside and the inside was creamy with little bits of pepperoni chunks! SO GOOD. Then we each had a wedge salad with bleu cheese dressing. I was surprised how big the salad was! I couldn't even finish mine it was so huge. The dressing was just OK, but did have nice chunks of bleu in it. For dinner, fiance had the \"Saucy Balls\" - 4 basic beef meatballs with house marinara and spaghetti and I had the Meatball sub combination: 3 beef meatballs with gouda cheese and marinara. The meatballs themselves had really good flavor and my sub was just OK...the marinara was almost TOO acidic in some weird way, and the bread was nothing special at all.  I am never a person who gets heartburn, but that sauce really did me in. It has a very acidic tomato taste. I guess I prefer my marinara with a little more body and just a bit of sweetness to offset all of that acid. Overall it was pretty good, but the sub was slightly underwhelming. However, the government cheese mac and cheese as a side.....OH MY GOD. This made up for every shortcoming of the meatball sub. Ditalini pasta and the most CREAMY and velvety cheese sauce....it was out of control amazing. I will absolutely be getting that again.   Overall it was a pretty good meal and our waitress so nice and attentive and brought our food out quickly. She was one of the best waitresses I have had in quite some time and really made our dinner experience great.   I will definitely be back for more of these sauce and meatball combos...I want to branch out beyond the marinara next time! Definitely worth the trip!",

We got four \"Saucy Balls,\" which consisted of beef with spinach and almond pesto, along with a crab balls appetizer. The latter came with 5 and was fairly good, nicely fried on the outside and lots of delicious crab meat on the inside. The meatballs were amazing though. They were not overly firm, and they also contained a lot of flavor. The green pesto also paired pretty well with them and the accompanying penne side. Probably some of the best meatballs I've had anywhere.",

I had never dined here and found the concept interesting. I had the spicy pork meatballs in a panini with arribita sauce. Excellent. I also tried the mac and cheese with government cheese. Very good as well. I would eat here again. I would like to try the upper floors as well.",

Each floor is something different! We weren't in the mood for meatballs or just tapas so to the 2nd floor we went, Mezzo.  There was four us and all shared the Artisan and italian cheese plates, as well as their bread basket to start. All of this came out along with someone to explain all the different types of cheese and bread we had in front of us.. Which was a lot! We were impressed the server knew exactly what each one was and how well he did presenting it. We enjoyed trying all the cheeses and testing our memory.  Next came dinner, we ordered a Quattro Fromaggi and Marghertia pizzas. They were a great follow up to our delicious start. These aren't your typical pizza joint pizzas, they were full of flavor and the perfect crust. After that, we were full as can be!  The service, their presentation and knowledge of the menu was on point. The ambiance is one of a kind in Pittsburgh with its three themes. I cannot wait to go try the next two floors!",

There was immediate seating at the bar, which we prefer.  The bartender, Scott, was one of the best we had in Pittsburgh.  He was pleasant, knowledgeable, efficient and attentive.    We decided to each have a salad and then split the Saucy Sampler.  I had the wedge salad and my husband had the house.  We both had the house Italian dressing which was excellent.    As an aside, all of the items were served in stainless steel bowls that had two handles.  I liked them so much I ordered 8 of them online when I returned home.  A wedge salad on a dinner plate is hard to eat, but in these bowls, it was contained just right.  For the saucy sampler, we had three traditional meatballs and a chicken.  I loved the chicken and my husband loved the traditional.  The marinara sauce was excellent.  These meatballs, especially the traditional, would have been great with the brown gravy, too.  If you are craving meatballs, this is the place to go.",

It all smelled SO good. The pricing was not bad but BE WARNED... thursday is reverse happy hour so there is no specials until 9 p.m. i believe.

I suggest calling ahead if you have more than 4 people since they do have been known to have long waits during the busy times.  Each of the levels is a different experience with my two favorites being the Meatball Joint closely followed by the Beer Garden.  Let's talk balls!  They.  Are.  Fabulous.  Each month there's a new ball being featured based on the time of the year, and then there's also the regulars.  You pick your ball, your sauce, and then lastly how it is served.  From small sliders to paninis, or served over pasta you have a crazy amount of combinations to pick from.  And the parmesan fries are to die for!  I hear they also have salads and that they're good ... but let's be honest, I don't eat greens.",

Also tried the fat heads bumble berry which tastes like fruity pebbles it was good and also had the full pint night of the living stout. It was decent as well. So all in all not bad here but not exceptional. Late night you can't be too picky. Hot as hell here downstairs. No circulation so eating sucks when your sweating. Service was decent.

I loved the mushroom gravy and the perfectly cooked tots. The cheese was merely normal, but I forgive them for not having cheese curds. It can get expensive pretty quickly so be sure to keep an eye out on your ordering. One of my friends got a ball with a Caesar salad and that looked quite filling.",

You choose your meat, sauce & how you want to eat your meatballs, e.g. Panini, in a bowl, a slider, etc. the beef and chorizo specialty were the best. I've loved the pesto and red sauce the best.   The tomato risotto is absolutely delicious. It melts in your mouth and a side is only $5. It pairs perfectly with the meatballs with red sauce.  We also love the poutine appetizer with tater tots & gravy. Not authentic, but to die for.",

    "text": "Okay people, so by now we all get the setup, right? Three floors, three different concepts (meatball (Emporio), pizza (Mezzo), and rooftop bar (Il Tetto)). I've had the opportunity to visit all three levels and have loved my experience at each.  The rooftop bar is absolutely lovely on a nice day. It has plenty of seating, a fantastic view overlooking Penn Ave, and delicious and interesting drinks. Unfortunately, the later in the night it gets, the more crowded it becomes, until pretty soon you're literally rubbing shoulders with random people around you. Unless you enjoy getting intimately familiar with increasingly drunk strangers, I'd recommend visiting Il Tetto earlier in the evening rather than later.  As for Mezzo, they serve upscale pizzas. On my particular visit, my friends and I shared the Quattro Fromaggi and Margherita pizzas. Both were incredibly tasty and well-seasoned with plenty of fresh cheese and a slightly sweet crust that was a perfect balance of crispy and chewy. They use high quality ingredients in their pies and it definitely shows.   Of the three levels, my favorite is Emporio. It's the most casual of the three (although I'd still classify all three levels as fairly casual, just trendy). This level focuses on meatballs and sides. It's essentially a build-your-own kinda thing where you can choose from a variety of meatball types, pick your sauce, and then choose how you want them to be served (i.e., single slider, two meatballs on a panini, three meatballs on a grinder, or four meatballs served over a side dish). Not being a huge meat eater, I opted for their vegetarian meatball served panini style (two meatballs smashed with cheese) with the spinach-almond pesto sauce. My husband tried the spicy pork meatball panini with arribiata sauce. Then we split mac n' cheese and tomato risotto as sides. The food was absolutely delicious! Interestingly, they don't serve the sauce on the panini itself...rather, they give you a bowl of it on the side....or rather, they give you a small trough of it! I had more than enough sauce for dipping my panini with at least a half cup leftover to just straight up shotgun if I was so inclined. The paninis looked a little small and unimpressive upon first glance, but the meatballs are quite large and dense (even the veggie ones). It definitely was more than enough to fill us up. The veggie meatball isn't quite the same texture as a regular meatball (it was a little mushy), but it had excellent flavor and paired really well with the pesto sauce. My husband reported that his spicy pork balls paired nicely with his arribiata sauce as well. And as for the side dishes, they were both winners. The mac n' cheese was creamy and sharp....just how I like it. And the tomato risotto was perfectly executed...slightly al dente, creamy, a little sweet, and a little cheesy. Both sides were a great complement to our paninis. We left stuffed to the gills and quite happy.  Note that Mezzo takes reservations, but Emporio does not. Both do use the NoWait app though, which is quite handy since this place is popular and usually commands a wait on the weekends. I'd give it three thumbs up (one for each level) if I had an extra to spare, but two thumbs will have suffice.",

Bar area is big and had a cool vibe to it.  They have a great beer selection and if you're not in the mood for alcohol get one of their homemade cream sodas - I got the Italian one - super tasty.    I ordered the poutine and added a classic beef meatball to it. Fries were crispy and gooey with the cheese and the meatball was good- nothing to write home about though.  I'd probably stick with the beef since the turkey meatballs my husband got were kinda dry and a bit bland.    Ironically, the wedding soup didn't have any of those adorable tiny meatballs in it - maybe you have to pay extra for it?    I'll probably give it another try because I love meatballs and I want them to do well so I hope they knock my meatball loving socks off when I go back.",

The only reason we couldn't give it 5 stars is for the service at the Meatball Joint. It was some of the worst service I've had. First, the hostess barely acknowledged us when we walked in (she was busy looking at her phone or something) and after about a full minute or so, she looked up and said \"yes?\" We asked for a table for 5 and she checked the table set up (there were plenty of open seats) and then had a small conversation with a waitress about the table set up. She picked up some menus and walked over to a table already set for 5. Once she put the menus down, she turned to us and impatiently said \"you can sit here.\" All through the night you could see her acting bored, ignoring customers, etc. Our waitress was no better. Very inattentive, and when we first sat down, gave us no time to order drinks and was impatient while we tried to determine. As she filled up our water glasses, she asked if it was our first time there. When we said \"yes\", her response was \"oh\" and then walked away. I think we saw her about 4 times over the course of our meal. We also asked her to change one the TVs to ABC and it was never changed and she appeared confused when we told her the channel with the specific game on it. The final thing was when we asked for the checks and told her specifically how to separate them, she came back with them messed up. So if you're okay with terrible service but great food - stop on in. I think we'll be back even with the horrible service.",

I didn't know about the other 2 floors. I ordered some meatballs and spaghetti on the 1st floor. You can build your own meatballs.  I got the arriabta sauce which is marinara sauce with a kick. It was good but I wanted more garlic and Italian seasoning in the sauce and meatballs. The spaghetti was the same. I also ordered their fried donuts with ricotta cheese inside that you can dip in chocolate which were good.  The two floors upstairs are even more fun and have hotter people in them!

I wanted a meal before I got on the bus home so I went to the 2nd floor (Mezzo). As soon as I walked in the manager (I think) was very friendly. When he saw my Yankees shirt, instead of cursing me out like most other people would do, he started a nice conversation with me about NYC. It turns out his wife is from not too far from where I'm from.   I had a salad and the Frutti di Mare, which I felt was a little small for a \"medium\" plate, but it had a lot of flavor. For dessert the Pear Mascarpone Cheesecake was sooooooo gooooood.",

The bad...and the reason for the three stars instead of four...the restaurant has a great upstairs, the reason we came here, but when we arrived at 6:00 on a Monday night we were originally shown to a small--very small--table at the end of a long booth, which was adjacent to the service area. When we asked for a table along the window, we were informed that they were reserved--all of them. When we asked for a table on the second row, we were informed that they were all reserved as well.   Practically our entire meal, those tables remained empty. In fact, we saw four more sets of guests leave because the tables weren't available.   We understand the need to reserve for large parties--not four-tops--but we do not understand reserving ALL your prime tables, which means that tables will sit empty for an hour instead of giving those tables to the patrons who are there and waiting.",

And on Monday's there is a \"Meatball Monday\" special that is definitely worth a try!  The second floor is also great.  The pizza's are huge and are displayed on the tables using old Marinara Sauce cans... great way to reuse and recycle! I've also tried the Mushroom Risotto, Roasted Beets, and all of the different salads! All are tasty and the right amount of savory and healthy!    Finally, the beer garden.  This is a great spot in the summer when the windows are open! But even in the midst of a snow storm the bar is still super crowded and the roof is a great spot to hang out with friends, people watch, and try craft beers! There is also a small food menu offered.  Great place to take guests from out of town! And maybe you'll see a Pens player dining there! (I've seen a few in my time :) )",

I must say the ambiance and decor was beautiful, it gave us a great feeling for the atmosphere the restaurant was trying to provide. The waiter was polite and attentive, although a bit divided since he was tending to quite a few tables.  We decided to order the pork rinds and I got the lamb bolognese as an entree. I have had an eye on this place for a while so I had high expectations. Unfortunately there was nothing too special about the pork rinds. The lamb bolognese seemed slightly undercooked, although I'm not an expert at identifying al dente. It wasn't off putting at first but my distaste definitely grew the more bites I took. What should one do in that situation? Ask the waiter to take a bite and confirm my suspicions? I decided to just box it to go and reheat it later, hoping that would cook it more. My boyfriend got a pork chop (I think), and it looked very appetizing but the flavors seemed to fit together strangely.   All in all, the restaurant and service was great, but the food seemed a bit off. The portions were of decent size, but I think some dishes (pork rind) were not worth their price.",

A couple weeks ago a few friends of mine were downtown later than usual on a Saturday and came to the rooftop.   I was surprised about how lively the space was. I had always assumed no one even came downtown on the weekends. It was pretty packed. There was a couple minute wait for the elevator, but waiting for an elevator inside is much better than waiting outside in the cold.   It was a good night out. Drinks were pretty good as well. The bartender knows how to make a delicious Moscow Mule.",

    "text": "Sienna Mercato is my go-to for downtown Pittsburgh dining. Situated along Penn Ave, it is in a perfect location- close to all Pittsburgh event centers, sports stadiums and arenas, the Strip District, and of course other downtown highlights. The three levels of SM create a distinctly unique experience and offers something for everyone. The first level, Emporio, takes uncommon risks on Italian classics. Some of my personal favorites include the tomato risotto, all mac n cheeses, delectable homemade pesto, and of course the poutine! Even though I'm Burgh-bred, I feel like a Canadian at heart, and the poutine here is outstanding. SM's second level, Mezzo, focuses on brick oven pizza and furthers the Italian experience. Delicious charcuterie and a vast wine selection make you feel like you're in a cozy tavern along the Mediterranean. SM's third level is my favorite, a rooftop bar adventure like no other. Their extensive cocktail list and modern twists on classic favorites offer something for both the young and old at heart. The rooftop also features a glass roof which allows guest to enjoy the rooftop bar experience even in Pittsburgh's cold winter months. Overall, this restaurant is unparalleled by anything else in the 412 and resembles something you would see in Chelsea or Hollywood. Sienna Mercato sets an unprecedented standard for other nearby restaurants.",

    "text": "At 7 pm on a weeknight, many of the restaurants on the Strip, including Sienna Mercato, had a handful of patrons - I wonder if this is typical for downtown Pittsburgh? Sienna Mercato's ground floor has an upscale sports bar feel, with a fast-casual type menu (with a set of numbered, step-by-step instructions to build your own meatball-based dish), but is a full service restaurant. Hope you like meatballs, because the menu primarily involves meatballs with sauce, meatball grinders, meatball sliders, or meatballs on spaghetti. I had the wedding soup with a veg-ball (made of mushrooms and soy), which was served on the side. The veg-ball was rather dry, so luckily I could dunk it in the soup. It was definitely my least favorite \"meat\"ball of the night. I then ordered a set of four saucy meatballs - one each of traditional beef, chicken, spicy pork, and the special meatball of the day, which happened to be breakfast sausage and pork. The special was my favorite - the most flavorful in my opinion, followed by the spicy pork.   Overall, the texture of the meatballs was ok - not stick-a-fork-in-it-falling-apart goodness that I've experienced at higher-end restaurants, but at Sienna Mercato's casual price point, it was fine. The creamy basil marinara sauce was delish. Each meatball was quite large, so that I couldn't finish my meal, and had some leftovers to box up. Service was friendly and the food came out quickly.  The draft beer list had quite a few selections, though most were pretty run-of-the-mill selections.",

They had a good selection of draft beers and they were half off - always a great thing! We tried their poutine and added the option for an egg on top. It was fine, but not the best I've had in the city. It was pretty small, and the egg was fully cooked which didn't allow for any dipping! :( However, after ordering we learned that it was also on the happy hour menu for $5 - maybe that's why it was small?  The top floor has a really nice set up with the large tables making it perfect for large groups. The rooftop makes it a really fun place to hangout when the weather is nice. On a busy weekend night you will have to wait in line to get up to the roof - sometimes it really takes forever!  I've had mixed experiences with service on both of their floors. Sometimes friendly, others not friendly at all, and most of the time somewhere in between. It's a big, busy place so I guess that's to be expected.   Overall I enjoy going to Siena for the experience of the rooftop bar in the city - but it's not my favorite place for food.",

Had a drink then cashed out and went to the 2nd floor to get the wood oven pizza.  We got the marghertia pizza.  It was amazing.  The basil on that pizza was sooo potent and amazing.  We were confused when we went to be seated.  We got the vibe it's very strict with reservations.  And everyone was dressed up but it's a casual atmosphere?  But that's okay no one looked at us funny.  Dinner was great, hubby got a mule and I tried 2 different red wines that were great!  They gave us 2 pieces of biscotti with the bill",

    "text": "Came here on a Monday for happy hour, which runs 4-6pm.  They have a bunch of deals including $5 poutine, half off well drinks, and half off drafts.  Meatball sliders are also $2 all day Monday.  Of course, we had to order all of the above.  I'll start off with the poutine; you're able to choose from tots or fries and it comes with mushroom or chicken gravy.  I'm from Montreal so this isn't really a traditional poutine but it's still pretty good.  Now moving onto the sliders, we decided to get one of every meat so we can sample.  The best in my opinion was the chicken with crack sauce or the spicy pork with arrabiata sauce.  For $2, these are a must.  I would probably order 4-5 sliders for myself next time I go.  Overall, this is a great place for happy hour that won't break the bank.",

    "text": "This three story restaurant has so many different personalities. The first floor is more casual, and all about the meatballs. The second is a more intimate, classy restaurant feel, and the third story is a rooftop bar. So this one location has something for everyone.   Came here with a few friends before going to the Benedum for a show. We checked in on the no-wait app (highly recommend doing this as they do get pretty busy) and when we arrived, we checked in on the app and stood in a corner near the entrance. The hostess definitely saw us yet did not greet us (there were two hosts and a hostess, none of whom acknowledged us). The app said there were a few groups ahead of us but when it was our turn to be seated, somehow our names were not called. When bringing this to the attention of the hostess, she said it was our fault for not going and checking in with the host stand when we got there, but usually the app will let you know when it's your time or you'll at least get a call. This wouldn't have been a big deal but she obviously saw us when we came in and she saw us standing in the corner waiting to be seated yet never once acknowledged us or anything of the sort. So we had to wait another 15-20 minutes (had already waited about 20 at this point).  Although the initial service wasn't great, our server and the food definitely made up for it. When the hostess finally seated us, she didn't bring menus or silverware but our server quickly remedied that and was very attentive to us the entire time. The food was amazing. I got two sliders and we shared an order of the parmesan herb fries (delicious!). I love how you can customize your order from what meat you want to the cheese and sauces. Personally I like choosing sliders because you can come up with so many combinations and you get to try a lot with one meal. The meatballs are quite large with 3 being very filling so plan accordingly. I wish we had saved room for the dessert balls because they sound AMAZING so I will definitely have to come back and make sure I try those next.",

The space is so cool but became easily overcrowded and hard to hear. I'm not sure if the glass windows above normally open up but since they were closed I think that trapped the sound a bit   I also wish that you didn't need to reserve and table to sit/ there was more seating for those who are just there for drinks. It was difficult to get the attention of a bar tender so we were awkwardly standing behind people sitting at the bar for a good 15 minutes trying to order drinks",

I love that you can put yourself on the wait list too, because it can get super busy on the weekends.  I was so happy to hear that they were gluten free friendly, considering this was a fave spot pre-celiac diagnosis. The only meatball you can get gluten free is chicken. I'm wondering why that is though? Let me be clear, I'm appreciative, but I wonder if it's harder to do the beef meatballs gluten free for some reason? Anyway, also happy to see the fries and tots are gluten free. That's not always the case because they're fried in the same frier as glutenous items usually. I honestly don't think I've had fries since I was diagnosed, and they were delicious!   I was bummed to see Auroch's gluten free beer isn't on the menu here. I saw they were mentioned on IG as being at Mercato. I asked our server and she was like, no we don't have it, and walked away. I went to the bar to double check and they mentioned it was probably their other location, which I forgot about. So here's a plea to carry Auroch's downtown too!?  Glad this can still be a dependable option while downtown!",

The restaurant is split into three floors, with a different type of food/drink on each floor. We stayed on the first floor (Emporio) which is all meatballs.  There was a decent selection of draft beers, so I got the Yammy Yammy (a sweet potato ale) which was really good. To eat, I ordered the Meatball Panini (2 meatballs with smoked gouda and the tomato basil cream sauce) with the vegetarian meatballs (mushroom, white bean, and cauliflower). The meatballs and the sauce were both super flavorful, but the portion was a little smaller than I was expecting. I also tried my friend's Crispy Parm Brussels Sprouts, which were amazing.   The waiter asked if we wanted extra parmesan on top of our meals, and several of my friends said yes. When they got the check, there was a 25 cent charge for the parmesan. 25 cents is obviously not a huge deal, but I thought it was weird that the waiter didn't mention it, and it didn't say anywhere on the menu that parmesan was extra.  Overall - a cool spot with yummy food.",

I have visited Emporio (the meatball joint) and Il Tetto (the rooftop beer garden) several times and all of my experiences have been wonderful!   Emporio is a wonderful place to bring guests of all ages because the unique concept is something fun that anyone can get behind! I've tried tons of varieties of meatballs/sauces/serving styles and I've never been disappointed! Beware: the meatballs are big and your eyes may be bigger than your stomach!   Il Tetto is a great place for a night out! There's a lot of awesome beverage choices and you can't beat the atmosphere. Even on a rainy night, you can still see the burgh's tallest buildings standing tall.   Located right on Penn in the heart of the cultural District, there's nothing not to love about Sienna Mercato.",

    "text": "I went to Emporio yesterday for lunch, and it was TREMENDOUS.  First, the ambiance of the place in and of itself is spectacular.  Dimly lit with artsy lighting (think bare, clear light bulbs, very industrial), dark wood walls, and cozy booths make Emporio very inviting.  There are plenty of (high, modern, metal) stools around the large bar, as well.    I didn't have a drink at lunch (I have to work, unfortunately), but there was an extensive list of beers on the chalkboard on the wall.  (also a feature I like).  The menu is divided up into appetizers, salads, soups, meatballs and sides.  You can get a \"ball\" on anything.  It's $2 to add a \"ball\" to your soup, salad, or side.  You can get $10 \"saucy balls\" - 4 meatballs in a sauce of your choice (and the sauce list is extensive!) and get a $4-5 side, and the meatballs and sauce will arrive graced over your side.  There are 4 different choices of meatball and 1 special every day.  The usual meatballs are beef, chicken, pork and veggie.    One thing I really liked about the menu is that it denoted which items were vegetarian and which are gluten-free.  For me, a person who avoids gluten, this proved very helpful.    I had the beef meatballs because I couldn't resist (despite the fact that they are not gluten free), with arrabiata sauce (GF) and white beans & escarole as the side to accompany the balls.  (also GF).  My one lunch partner had the same while the other started with an appetizer of arancini balls before digging into some meatballs.    The beef meatballs were rather amazing.  They were moist and perfectly cooked, and were very well-seasoned.  They were just tremendous.  The arrabiata sauce was just a little spicy, like the waitress advertised.  The beans and greens were done well, and the combination between the arrabiata-sauced meatballs and the side was a nice pairing.  I couldn't get enough of the dish, ate it all, and was pleasantly full after (it helped that I had a 10 minute walk back to my office after).  My friends were similarly pleased with their meals.  I can't wait to see what is in store for Emporio and the other floors of Sienna Mercato when they open!  I might just become a regular.  Truly fantastic.",

    "text": "This is a brilliant idea: one place, three restaurant options, three different floors. First floor serves meatballs, second floor serves pizza and pasta and third floor serves beer and drinks. Personally, my favorite is Emporio, the meatball joint. The food is good and reasonably priced, and they have the same drinks that are served on the 3rd floor. I've just about tried every meatball and every sauce here and they've all been satisfying. I usually get a couple sliders of different meat and sauce combos so I can sample as many of their offerings as possible. The fries and poutine are great and so are their salads. There's not much you can go wrong with here. As far as Mezzo, the pizza and pasta floor, it's ok. I've had way better pizza at other places in town. And for Il Tetto, the beer garden, the atmosphere is nice so it gets a crowd. However, keep in mind that the first floor has the same prices and they also have happy hour specials, which Il Tetto does not have. Overall, great concept. The meatballs will have you coming back.",

Among other items (your apps, salads, sides) you pick your meatball, your sauce/gravy, and how you want it served.  The beer selection is good too!

Highlights: nice ambiance with high ceilings with that classy/ rustic Italian thing going on (and a big wall o' wine), nice wine-by-the glass selection in either 3- or 6-oz pours, and an appealing menu.  Aside from the wood-fired pizzas, there is a build-your-own cheese and meat charcuterie platter, several delicious-looking pastas, nice salads, and a few more traditional meat-based entrees.    My dinner date and I started with salads and split a pizza.  I had the escarole salad and he had the kale, and they were both delicious.  Mine had very tasty marinated tomatoes and a rich, creamy (but not too heavy) dressing. We had the wood-fired vegetable pizza, which was more Neapolitan-style.  The sofrito/ tomato sauce was rich and tasty.  Light on the cheese, like a lot of thinner pizzas.  We tried a few different reds and they seemed like great, mostly Italian selections (the barbera was my fave).  We were also totally drooling over all the pasta dishes that were passing us by, so I might try one of those next time (which they also offer in half-portions; a nice touch).   Overall, I think these owners have a good thing going with Italian food, and Mezzo is by far my favorite level of Sienna Mercato.",

    "text": "This review is for Emporio.  I came here on a double date on a Thursday night. We arrived at 6 and the place was busy but not filled to capacity. They told us a 20-30 minute wait (which I didn't understand b/c I could clearly see 2 open tables that would have fit us) but it ended up being more like a 5-10 minute wait.  I was able to try a decent amount of menu items: Poutine: I opted for the tater tots (you can also get regular fries) topped w/ mushroom gravy (other options were chicken gravy and any of the sauces they put on their meatballs) and cheese curds. This was a decent sized portion for $7. It was pretty tasty though on the salty side. Pepperoni Fritters: Meh. I couldn't taste any pepperoni in these fritters which was super disappointing. Why are these named pepperoni fritters if there is ZERO pepperoni flavor. It tasted like fried cheese w/ a side of marinara. Fried Pickles: Yummy and huge portion but you can only eat so many pickles in one sitting :P Meatball Grinders: I got the turkey meatballs topped w/ almond pesto sauce and smoked gouda. My boyfriend got the spicy pork meatballs topped w/ creamy parmesan sauce and provolone. I thought the turkey meatballs were on the dry side and lacked flavor, and that the pork meatballs were decent but not mindblowing. There were 3 meatballs in each sandwich. The bread was bland and boring. It was a very average meatball sandwich.  My boyfriend and I also got 2 glasses of beer for him ($7.50 each) and a glass of sauvignon blanc for me ($10). Prices to be expected for a downtown restaurant.  Also, I had contemplated getting the 4 meatball option but unfortunately they don't allow mixing so you're stuck w/ 4 of the same meatballs/sauces. Sucks b/c it would be a great way to try all 4 of their meatball options. I don't think you can mix on the sandwiches either. If you want to try all 4 meatballs you would have to order 4 individual sliders which are $3.50 each.  Overall, the food was underwhelming. In all honesty, if it were closer to where I live, I may revisit...but it just isn't worth the trip to downtown Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I had such high hopes based on other reviews, but ultimately I was left a bit disappointed.  Perhaps it was a result of having my expectations set too high based on the feedback of others, but I was not impressed.  Atmosphere - 8/10 - very cool decor with open air front, reclaimed wood and rustic decor throughout.  I really like the vibe in here.  The only downside was that, when seated near to the sidewalk with the front windows all of the way up, the sidewalk is the de facto smoking area and I was constantly getting mouthfuls of hot and humid cigarette smoke.  Nothing SM can really do about that, but it still gets -1 point.  Service - 5/10 - agree with one of the other reviewers that the seemingly \"anything goes\" vibe in terms of waitstaff clothing was a bit odd.  I didn't see anything too outrageous, but it definitely classed the place down a little bit.  I'm not expecting Ceviche here, but being able to quickly identify your server vs. a patron is kind of a necessity.  I also just didn't get the warm and friendly vibe from a single person (hostess, host, server, or otherwise). Granted, they were busy, but you should never be too busy to provide great service.  Lastly, your menu has no description of what is in the meatballs or what the sauces are.  Either provide a side menu with basic descriptions or incorporate that into the server's table greeting.  Whatever you do, don't A) be annoyed when we ask questions or B) give one word answers because you're busy.  Food - 4/10 - really blown away by the 4 and 5 star reviews on this one.  My wife got the sliders and tried 3 different varieties. I got the panini with the meatball of the day.  When you base your concept around a single thing, you better be pretty good at it.  This was just average.  I want to be blown away with how good the meatballs or the sauce are, but I just wasn't.  The food wasn't very hot either, and the cheese on the entrees wasn't even melted.  It seemed they had rushed it through the broiler or oven because they were busy.  Disappointing :(  Price - 8/10 - for the location, very reasonable.    I wish I could give this a 2.5 star because it just wasn't quite a 3 for me.  If either the food or service improve only slightly I would have given it 3 stars.",

I don't really get the appeal, I suppose.  The place was very crowded and loud. The food is mediocre. (I could direct you to plenty of divey Pittsburgh bars with better food), and the service is just...okay.  I tried a couple versions of their meatballs as well as I believe their fried pickles. Everything is greasy, tasteless, and pretty much boring. Perhaps their other floors are better, but I would not recommend the \"meatball floor.\" Good beer selection and probably ok for a quick bite during happy hour time, but that's about it.",

I was part of a wedding party that had been working with their Manager to plan post-wedding activities on the roof top. All was set weeks before their wedding. We arrived after the wedding, some of us before others and went right upstairs. When the Bride and Groom arrived with other guests, they would not let them in because the bride didn't have her ID. After some peaceful exchange about the pre-set plans and providing proof that she was in fact a medical doctor, which would require being over the age of 21, the staff became very rude. The used expletives and denied everyone entry. They then came upstairs and told us, \"Just so you know, the rest of your party is not being allowed in tonight and we recommend you leave too!\" We did just that. Terrible customer service.",

While both were cooked well, the salt content was over the top.  You need to allow your customer to decide how much salt they want/need. That said, service was great and everyone was a great help. Side note...  the wine could have been sold at a cooler temp. If the wine is going to be second rate (and this customer did not expect different) then serve it with a slight chill. Very simple. I hope this serves as a constructive opinion rather than a scathing rant. Hope the chef listens. Thank you. B",

It's a comfortable restaurant that's only been open for about two months. The meatballs were delicious and the menus were very original. I had the pork meatballs in a panini with Gouda and spinach almond pesto. The sauce was amazing. For a side I had the rocket salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Great atmosphere with the bar and stainless steel dining. Definitely going back again to try the other sauces. Our waiter told us they're going to have 3 floors with a rooftop area too. Great addition to the restaurant scene of downtown Pittsburgh.",

The pork was flavorful and had a little bit of a kick to it.  I wouldn't have minded some bread to mop up the sauce with, but unfortunately there wasn't any.    For a sit down lunch, it was very quick service and shouldn't be a problem getting in and out in a reasonable amount of time.    I would like to return for dinner as it looks like they have an extensive beer selection, and would like to try more things on the menu.",

Everyone but me was from out of town. One of them is also a yelper and was excited to try the meatballs. I was pleasantly surprised that I could just order one meatball for 3.50.  Awesome, so I ordered two and split an order of brussel sprouts with a coworker.  I tried the vegetarian and the beef, both in marinara sauce.  The beef was great, the vegetarian not so much.  Maybe a different sauce would have helped, there are many to choose from.  As other reviewers have stated, the meatballs could be warmer.  The brussel spouts were good also. Splitting an order is a good idea because the portion is huge!  What I liked the best were the fried pickles.  I think these were the best fried pickles I've ever had.  Each of us enjoyed the pickles!!  You can imagine parking would be difficult downtown. But I have found parking right at a corner lot at Penn & 10th to be convenient. It was $12 the night I was there. As a comparison, a lot in the strip near the Heinz History center was 5$.  (The prices can fluctuate widely day by day depending the events going on, etc.) So great time especially with a group.",

I love love love Mezzo. I can definitely add this place to my list of places that I truly enjoy and will frequent.   We had a lovely window/garage door open seat on our first visit. We ordered the Butcher Board with cheese... And boy was it yummy.  They make the charcuterie in house (cheeses are not made in house). We then opted to split a pizza (perfect for two people).  We had the margherita but there were several others calling my name. It gives me something more to go back for.  They have a selection of great sounding pastas (more to try), a dessert list that even I (who is not a big sweets person) was interested in- we opted for the Pear Brulee. Nothing was disappointing. That also includes the wine list and the service.   We came back again and did the Chef's Table with a group, and all I can say is damn it was good. So much food! It's five courses of yummy.  Meat and cheeses, eggplant caponata, toasted bread, salad, pizzas, pasta galore, and dessert.  The assortment was fabulous.  We left with full and happy bellies!   This place is on my top five places to go for date night in Pgh already :) I highly recommend it.",

I got the 4-meatball deal (turkey) then put it all over macaroni & cheese with pesto. Awesome! The food was SO filling and so delicious. I was skeptical of being full, but I sure was! All for $15.00 as well. I would definitely come here again!  Now, for upstairs! Who doesn't love a good freaking rooftop?! I sure do! The roof is actually retractable so if it's cold, raining or anything else, the glass roof can close. Luckily, it was a nice night out so we were able to enjoy the roof open. Drinks were good, moderate in price, but I absolutely loved the atmosphere and I would come here often just to chill.",

    "text": "Looks nice, but that's about it. Confusing set up with three separate restaurants with their own individual food and drink menus. I went here with a large group after a work conference. We called a week prior and inquired about reserving the rooftop, and were told it was first come, first serve but that sitting together wouldn't be an issue. Not sure how, but our group ended up on the second level, which is again a different restaurant, and we were all at separate tables. It was very odd and defeated the purpose of coming as a group. The menu on the second floor was more appetizing than the rooftop, but the beer and wine selection was minimal. Everyone ordered pizza and I ordered the scallops off the \"medium plate\" section. They came out and I was surprised to see two very tiny scallops surrounded by various greens, pancetta (not \"bacon\"), and a sauce. The scallops were so overcooked they bounced off the bowl, which should have stopped me from trying them but it didn't. They were as salty and overcooked as they appeared, and the pancetta was chewy and not nearly crispy enough. I ended up sending them back. It seemed that everyone enjoyed the pizza, but wood fire pizza isn't that difficult to make palatable so I wasn't impressed.   Our server was nice and attentive, which I appreciated. My only complaint was that when refilling the water I noticed all of the servers touching the mouth of the water to the lip of everyone's glasses. That is unsanitary and just nasty, in my opinion.",

They have charming street lamps and string lights hanging as well. The crowd is normally lively and there are plenty of tables and space for standing. If you need some fresh air if the ceiling is closed, there is a little balcony you can escape to as well. Their beer and wine selection is great and their cocktails have never disappointed. I will definitely continue stopping in... and maybe one day even try some of their famous meatballs at the Emporio!",

First floor- 1 star. probably the most disgusting meatballs I've ever had. Huge, dry, and flavorless. I got the spicy marinara sauce which tasted like watery pasta sauce and pesto cream which was just tasted like tasteless cream, no pesto flavor at all. Pretty bad.   Second floor restaurant was delicious though! I don't normally like gnocchi but this one was so soft and delicious with mushroom, basil and corn. We almost ordered a second! Pizza was piping hot and good as well. Our waiter recommended the farro salad. I was skeptical thinking how good can those grains be.. I was pleasantly surprised how bright and flavorful it was! Service was great as well! We told our waiter we were cold so they immediately turned down the ceiling fan in our area. Very thoughtful.",

Sat by the open window in the front and enjoyed the energy and people walking by.  Food was excellent. Had fried ravioli and bruschetta for appetizers. The ravioli was good and the sauce very good so knew the main course was going to be good already. The bruschetta was exceptional, the kids commented (20 and 22) on how much they enjoyed it.  The main course meatballs, of course were tasty. Good bread on the panini and hoagie. French fries were baked and not bad at all.  Service was terrible. Only saw the waiter 3 times. When he came at the end of the meal we asked for for to go containers since each of us had a considerable amount of delicious food (very large portions) we wanted to take home. He came back and said I grabbed a couple and dropped of the check. Well, a couple was 2 large containers and one small container. We couldn't fit all our food into it. When he came back pointed out to him that we had asked for four containers and he hadn't done that and he should pay more attention to what he was doing. He brought back 2 more and I gave him my credit card. When he brought it back he just dropped it on front of my son's girlfriend who was sitting to my left. I said give it to me not her. He picked it up and threw it in front of me and said \"you need to be more respectful\" I demanded to see the manager and he walked away. I told the manager what happened and while he said he would deal with it I doubt very much whether he did.  So, waiter worked for free. Had he been not a jerk he would have made 25 bucks had he been nice and checked on us he would have made 20.  I won't go back. I work too hard for my money to spend it on a place with rude lazy wait staff",

You can choose number, bowl or sandwich, type of meatball, and sauce. I got a veggie meatball slider with buffalo ranch which was quite good!

    "text": "My mother-in-law put a lot of pressure on herself to make our rehearsal dinner perfect. While I envisioned something smaller, she wanted to do something special for her only son and his soon-to-be wife on their wedding weekend. So she chose the rooftop at Sienna Mercato.  To start, we walked in at 3 PM and to our surprise, the rooftop was open to the public, even after we were told via email the rooftop would be opened for us only to rehearse from 3-4 PM.  Our section was not roped off as promised, there were no selective drink menus that we discussed previously, no alcohol wrist bands for our guests, our slide show (which took a lot of time scanning photos and memories onto the computer) was never displayed on the screens as promised, and we were supposed to have 4 - 5 servers dedicated to our event as well, and the only time we even saw ONE was when we completely ran out of something.    I had a cake delivered to the restaurant, and when it came time to cut it, I had to do it myself... the pastry chef was \"gone,\" but nevertheless, I'm not sure why the servers or event manager weren't capable of cutting the cake?  They handed me a massive knife (not meant for cake cutting), stood there, and watched me cut the it the whole time.  The knife was so enormous, they literally had to stand there and \"guard\" it when I wasn't using it.  If something like using the knife is such a huge liability that it needs a \"guard,\" a staff member should be the one cutting the cake - not someone who is paying to host the event. The real cherry on top was the fact that Sienna Mercato lost our custom $200 cookies we had ordered... even though they a) were delivered with the cake and b) we were assured via email that they would go where they needed to go.   On top of all of this... they charged a 22% gratuity (totaling $1,100). I understand that 22-24% is standard in catering and events, but the fact that SO many mistakes were made on an event that my mother-in-law spent over $6,000 on and 22% was STILL added to an incorrect bill is laughable.   Their solution?  Refund my mother-in-law $800 (which doesn't even cover  the incorrect gratuity she paid) and refund me $200 for the missing cookies.  The only exception to the poor service was one of the bartenders, Andrea, who went above and beyond to try to give us an amazing experience.",

    "text": "4.5 stars.  I dined at the mezzo level during restaurant week, and was in for a treat.  Where most restaurant week menus were pretty fixed, Sienna Mercato was like, nah, allow yourself to indulge in whatever you want.   To start, I had the fried eggplant and cured beef. The salad in both dishes were a bit on the oily side, but at least the salad tasted good.   Then, for the medium dishes I had a slow roasted pork belly and the mussels. For the price, the mussels are an absolute steal because you get so many of them. The slow roasted pork belly was also really fun. You don't get much, but it's definitely a delicious piece to enjoy.  For the mains, my favorite had to be the shrimp pasta. The sauce is at the perfect spiciness to give a tingle, but not overwhelm you. I enjoyed the fresh pasta and the shrimp of course. The other mains were alright---the pork chop I would've preferred to be cooked closer to medium, the farm chicken was on the dry side, and the seafood pasta was nice but nothing super outstanding.  By the time I got to dessert, I was absolutely stuffed, but hey, always room for more dessert. I found the apple dessert to be the star here. The warm apple slices were super comforting at the end of a fabulous meal.  Overall, the plating for all the dishes were very well put together. They had enough pizzazz to wow you, but didn't excessively put useless ingredients since everything was still edible, and could play some role in the flavor combination.   Enjoyed my experience and would highly recommend!",

However, that's about all I love about this place. The food selection on the rooftop bar is minimal, mostly bar food - like Jerky, and small snacks (not burgers, or anything like that) I wish that the restaurant allowed food from the other 2 floors to be brought upstairs.   I'm a wine drinker, for $10 you get a tiny mediocre wine, but that's an expected price for downtown! They have mixed drinks, and a pretty nice beer selection as well.   This place is surrounded by great restaurants, so I would even suggest stopping here to finish off the evening. One of my favorite downtown spots for a nice view of the city!",

We ordered the fried ravioli and the bruschetta for appetizers. I ordered the matza ball soup, which comes with your choice of a meatball. I went with the chicken meatball. The meatball comes in the soup. To me, the chicken meatball was the star of the show. It had such good flavor. Overall the matza ball soup was really good too. It had pieces of chicken in it, along with the matza balls and veggies. I also got a side Cesar salad which was supposed to have croutons, shaved parm and romaine. It didn't have any croutons on it, but it was still a good salad overall. I ordered a chicken panini with smoked Gouda and crack sauce on the side. I also got him a side of fries too. The sides are $6/piece, but you get a large amount, and it's definitely enough to share with 2-3 people. I tried the panini and it did not disappoint either.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because our waiter was a little pushy and it seemed like he was trying to rush us along. I didn't really like that. But overall, I would definitely come back here again.",

    "text": "Sienna Mercato is a three story restaurant offering a different dining experience in each floor.  First I think the architecture of the building is great; tons of wood and exposed brick make it a modern and inviting environment.  Emporio is in the first floor and specializes in meatballs, pastas and has an excellent beer list.  It's also the most casual.  Happy hour at Emporio is very good with beer discounts and food.    Mezzo is in the second floor and is a little more upscale.  It features excellent wood fired pizzas, appetizers and charcuterie.  I think the food is very good and the service is also good.  The cocktail menu is well done and the bartenders know what they are doing.  I've come here with friends several times and always have an enjoyable evening.  It would also be a good location for a date.  Mezzo can get busy so I would recommend planning in advance and having a reservation.   Il Tetto is on the third story and is the roof top bar with a great view of the city above. It is accessed from the elevator in the back of the first floor.  Depending on the night it can be busy and will have to wait to go up.  In the summer the glass ceiling is open providing lots of fresh air.  In the winter the space is heated and comfortable.  Usually I stop here before going to a game or event in the city for a drink and you can order appetizers.  There are also long high top tables so you can meet friends and gather around.     I have always had very good experiences at Sienna Mercato.  The prices can get a little high but I don't find it outrageous for the quality.  Plan ahead and enjoy!",

Now that I'm done reeling from yet another realization that I, too, am getting older, it's time for an updated tell-all about the balls...  Meatballs, you weirdos.  I was here for dinner last week and our group indulged in the buffalo chicken meatballs and cheesy bread appetizers.  Both were tasty and shared easily among our table of 6.  I found the buffalo chicken meatballs to be just spicy enough, and I loved the shaved celery/blue cheese combo that topped the whole dish.  While perusing the menu for my dinner selection, I couldn't take my eyes off the Angry Birds bowl: two chicken meatballs, crack sauce, and crumbled bleu cheese atop government mac and cheese.  Sign. Me. Up!  I ate a little over half my meal and still felt comfortable enough to walk out of the restaurant under my own volition.  Bonus: the leftovers made for some quality snacking the next day.    The one word I kept using to describe my feelings after the meal was \"content.\"  It was such a yummy, comforting bowl of food and I absolutely plan to order it again soon.    Quality comfort food and the option to take in the rooftop atmosphere of Il Tetto after your meal are great reasons to come here on your own or bring visitors for a taste of 'tahn.",

    "text": "So this place is really two restaurants, maybe even three if you count the rooftop. I've eaten at both the Mezzo, on the middle level, and Emporio, on the bottom level. If I have to recommend either, it would probably be the bottom level and you gotta get those balls.  Mezzo was kinda upscale with plenty of pasta and pizza choices. I ended up Shrimp Fra Diavolo and my boss the Duck Speck pizza. Both were well executed, but nothing to write home about.  Emporio is a different story altogether. The atmosphere is much more laid back and it feel more like a pub than anything else. Showing up on a Monday turned out to be a good idea, since they serve meatball sliders for $2 each. I got the following: beef with tomato basil cream, pork with government cheese, and chicken with crack sauce. All were absolutely delicious, especially the pork which I was a bit skeptical about when the waitress suggested it. Serious good eat for cheap? What's not to love?",

    "text": "I've eaten at Emporio Meatball Joint, the first floor restaurant of Sienna Mercato, several times before writing this review and the consistency of the high quality food and outstanding service is beyond impressive. After many meals with lots of different people in groups ranging between four and 14, the food always rocks and the service is always flawless.  The menu is has some great starters. My favorites include the crab balls, Buffalo chicken balls and the rocket salad. The entrees are all meatballs, which seems improbable, but with the three step fun process  -- pick your ball, pick your sauce and pick your preparation (and perhaps a side), the possibilities are endless and it never gets old. I'm a fan of keeping it simple with the saucy balls. Servers can often suggest some winning combinations with particular sauces and sides. There's an extensive craft beer selection that's heavy on local brews, some good cocktails and an adequate selection of wines.  Service is always on-point. I have to give the restaurant props for the ease with which they handle large tables. On at least two occasions I've had over a dozen people at a single table. Not only does the staff nail it by getting orders correct and having courses arrive at once, but upon request they cheerfully provide separate checks (yes, even for 12 persons!) and they make it look easy. I can think of a lot of restaurants that could learn a thing or two from the customer service that Emporio provides.  The atmosphere is fun and lively with a good soundtrack. Big windows at the front open to the sidewalk when the weather is nice. There are high-top tables in the bar available too.  There's no reservations,but it's a sizeable place and tables are always turning over. Plus, they use the No Wait smartphone app very effectively and the bar area is an inviting place to wait, as is Il Tetto, the third floor rooftop bar worthy of its own praise (as is Mezzo, the second floor restaurant).  For those unfamiliar with downtown Pittsburgh, it's worth nothing that the restaurant is very close to the convention center, Westin Hotel and Courtyard by Marriott and is only a few blocks from the theaters of the cultural district and the bridges that lead to PNC Park and the Warhol Museum.",

AWAY FROM WALL WHILST IN LINE FOR ELEVATOR o You may be physically pushed (female, or not) if you step out of line o Member of staff may not hesitate to demean and degrade you with terribly inappropriate language (Jarvis... here's to you.)  If you're still interested, try the tater tots. They're actually pretty good. But don't even bother getting a drink upstairs... if you haven't noticed yet. The service sucks.",

We then proceeded upstairs to the beer garden. My disappointment came that they don't have the same drink menu and it was very loud. I had to drink a different wine (not a single rose available) and we couldn't hear each other speak. Not horrible, but my only complaint! If we would have just eaten dinner and left, it would have been perfect!",

    "text": "Sienna Mercata has been on my short list of places to try for some time when visiting Pittsburgh for work travel.  I stayed at the Westin on this particular visit and the restaurant was within a short walking distance, so I took full advantage!   I dined on the first floor at Emporio.  I normally frequent restaurants that use Open Table, because I hate to wait.  This restaurant was not on Open Table, but does use a Call Ahead process, and corresponding Mobile App, which was pretty cool!   I arrived based on notification from the app, and was seated immediately.  I had previewed the menu, and pretty much knew what I wanted to order.  I ordered a salad to start.  The salad was simple but tasty.  I then ordered the beef meatballs with mushroom gravy with a side of veggie Quinoa.  My entree arrive a short time later.  I love mushrooms, so I was kinda expecting actual mushrooms in the gravy, there were none.  Also, I expected the quinoa to arrive warm, it was cold dish, which was not indicated on the menu.  The meatballs were excellent, great texture and flavor.  The gravy was tasty as well, even without actual mushrooms.  The quinoa was good, but really contrasted with the warm meatballs. I couldn't eat them together, so I ended up eating the meatballs and leaving most of the quinoa.  Next time, I'll opt for a warm carb to accompany the meatballs.  I finished the meal with warm ricotta donuts.   The donuts were warm, rich and tasty.  I also requested a side of fudge sauce for dippings.....yum!   I can't wait to return.",

My wedge salad was very fulfilling with the heat bacon and out of this world randy dressing. Definitely try the ranch.

We sat in a booth in the bar area on the main level which is the Emporio. This is the meatball joint. The pasta level was already closed... So we ordered meatballs with spaghetti and some with penne. My husband ordered risotto and did not care for it. To me the flavor and color reminded me of Spaghettio's. They have different styles of meatballs and we had the special, which consisted of pork, rolled with pieces of pepperoni and parm cheese and the second style was spicy pork. I liked the spicy pork better. The noodles are gluten free and we didn't care for the texture or taste. Our waitress was kind but she didn't check on us often. We had to ask a different waitress for almost everything we needed. They also give a carafe with water, but do not ask if you want ice or even a straw. After I asked for that she brought a larger glass with water but never provided refills. So I kept refilling my glass from the carafe, but by the end of our meal the ice was melted from the room temp water! Overall it was a mediocre experience including the food. We will not return.",

    "text": "Can a vegetarian enjoy a joint that specializes in meatballs? The answer is yes. The restaurant provides a vegetarian largely bean based meatball and plenty of vegetarian friendly sauces to go with it that are marked as vegetarian so you can be clear. You can get it in a traditional sandwich type way or have it with their extensive sides such as mac and cheese, penne, risotto, or a quinoa. I had mine with the pesto almond sauce and Gouda cheese. Very delicious. The parmesan fries are really delicious as well served with an awesome aioli dip.   Sierra Mercato is three levels technically. The top floor is a rooftop bar type setting filled with unwinding young professionals for the most part. It is quite nice, but does not have the same menu as downstairs. The wait time is usually pretty long. My recommendation is to have a drink on the rooftop from the bar and use the Nowait App to get a seat downstairs and enjoy their delicious food that is not available upstairs. They do have small plates upstairs though. 2nd floor bar/restaurant is not open yet. Oh and PS, the prices are pretty reasonable considering the cultural district location and \"nice\" ambiance.",

When we got there we started to discuss \"plan B\" after we requested seating for six. The hostess said that the biggest booth that she had available could only seat five. After a bit of discussion we decided that we'll make it work somehow. The hostess took us to a round booth in the corner and it easily fit all six of us. The seating area where we were seemed to be on the darkish side but the booth was comfortable and we sat there for about five minutes before a waitress came over and asked if we'd like to get started with drinks.  I asked if we could see menus and the waitress seemed a little annoyed... not annoyed at us, but more on the order that the hostess who seated us should have already brought us menus. Perhaps this has happened before but she was kind enough to get them for us.  I think it's kind of interesting how the menu is laid out when it comes to ordering meatballs. You first pick what type of meatball you want, classic beef, spicy pork, vegetarian or turkey; then you choose a sauce; finally you decide how you want your meatballs served be it on sliders, a panini, a grinder or in a bowl. We all ordered something different; I ordered the spicy pork with Bolognese in a bowl. It didn't take very long for our individual meals to come out.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal and my spicy pork meatballs were yummy. They were a little smaller than a tennis ball and generously covered in rich Bolognese sauce.  Other than the hostess being a bit \"off her game\" today, I give Emporio a thumbs up.  I don't think that it's one of those places that you order the same thing each time you go. There's so many combinations of meatball choices to choose from.",

The place is really just a meatball joint that offers a variety of meats to choose from and then some really good appetizers/finger foods, fries, and salads. The portion sizes are more than adequate, too...and the prices are pretty reasonable for downtown eating.   Not to forget, the place does have a great \"feel\" to it with the open-wall style seating so you can watch the passers-by.  I'd definitely be interested to try the rooftop bar on a great weather night.   3.5 stars, but giving it a little bump to 4 since it's above 3 stars, for sure.

Emporio has the fun, the beer selection, and delicious food.  I cannot comment much on the menu because I never make it past the special or the ball of the month.  They've never let me down.

We live very close to downtown and we're used to the parking situation but trying to find parking on the street where the restaurant is located can be a challenge to say the least. The hostess seemed pretty freaked out that we had a little kid with us, but the wait staff was professional and helpful. The food was decent , well seasoned and well prepared we ordered spaghetti for the kid and it didn't come with meatballs so we added on meatballs of each type to our meal, each had a salad and we split a panini. We ask the server if the panini was large enough to split and she stated that it was, but if you're hungry don't take advice from a thin person because the panini was barely enough for just one person. My advice is avoid the house Italian dressing unless you like a really sweet dressing that kind of ruins your salad. The atmosphere was nice we have plenty of room to eat and we will probably return to try the different restaurants on each level. This restaurant is definitely worth I try especially at lunch when it doesn't seem to be too busy.",

The goal was to spend an hour or so on the rooftop beer garden then get \"in line\" for Mezzo using the app.    The five of us spent the first 25 minutes attempting to get a bartenders attention.  Unfortunately, they were all too busy muddling stuff and concocting drinks that involved 19 ingredients to even be capable of looking up.  We were eventually able to grab a server walking by, despite the fact that there wasn't a chance of getting a seat. The server was fantastic.  However, everything went on my bill, so I had a hefty tab for two rounds that was too difficult to split.    Our table did become available in a fair amount of time on the first floor, but there was a lack of communication among our group and someone had also requested a table on the roof.  We cancelled the table on the first floor, and grabbed the rooftop table.  However, we were not exactly clear of the limited menu.  I'm talking beef tartare, olives, rosemary and sea salt nuts, bruchetta, focaccia, and the cheese plate.  We ordered all of these, which is EVERYTHING they have to offer minus two other apps.   I left starving, and confused.  Too many rules, too much confusion.  Never again on a Friday night.",

There is a glass roof that retracts (don't worry, there are millions of space heaters), and the view is amazing.  I haven't tried the bar snacks on this floor, but the bartenders are super-friendly and the ambiance is 100% worth it even if they were serving nothing but IC Light.   Mezzo is the restaurant on the middle floor.  It gets super-crowded, so I recommend using NoWait or going on off-hours.  They have a full menu heavy on pizza and pasta.  While not super-sophisticated, it's also not red-sauce/Olive Garden Italian, which is a great.   Emporio is the meatball joint on the ground floor.  Everything I've tried so far is solid, if not earth-shattering.  The bar is a great spot for happy hour, to watch a game, or just to spend 4-5 hours on a Saturday afternoon until you fall off of your bar stool (uh, my friend told me that last part).",

This is unfortunate because it doesn't let me try a wider variety of your food and also because it's unbelievably easy to accommodate.  I should be able to get 4 different kinds of meatballs if I want.  Seriously?  I didn't eat in the restaurant but it seemed to be having the usual identity crisis that most Pittsburgh restaurants and bars have.  Half upscale, half sports bar.  Nice decor, ESPN on a TV.  Make a choice and stick with it.  My comparisons were easy to make because there's a meatball only restaurant in my town (24th & Meatballs) that does a much better job and has been doing it for longer (i.e. I'm sure this place is probably a rip off).  I have no problem with that but a 2nd generation restaurant has every opportunity to do it better.  I'll give it one more shot.  I'll have to just so I can try a different flavor of meatball.",

I went twice and got a few different meatballs with different sauces I mixed and matched.  They each came out in individual little bowls.  I got beef, pork, chicken, and vegetarian with a variety of sauces.  And each day they also have a special meatball of the day.  They were all amazing, even the vegetarian one that I had with a delicious pesto sauce.  I also really enjoyed the mac-n-cheese and poutine (available with pancetta and a fried egg on top!).  The atmosphere is trendy with a good vibe and now that the weather is nice they have the front wall opened up to the outside which is really nice.

They give you the sauce in a small metal bowl that is big enough to dip the sandwich easily and they give you plenty of sauce. It was great.

The Caesar salad had great croutons, fantastic dressing, and we cleaned it up totally (It's too bad that really crisp, fresh romaine lettuce is unobtainium in this part of the country in the fall and winter.)  We had the Poutine (French-fried potatoes baked with cheese) with a meatball, which was very filling as a main course. The panini (two pork meatballs) with tzatziki sauce was also great, a perfect serving size. The sauce is really a great counterpoint for the spicy pork, and the crispy bread was the perfect texture for the assembly. Their tzatziki is authentic, with thinly-sliced cucumbers, and was easy to dip and apply to the panini with a knife, bite-by-bite. We both felt quite full with the salad and two dishes.  Our waiter was fun, easy-going, informative, relaxed, and made good recommendations. A Chilean sauvignon blanc paired great with everything.   And the decor is really well designed. Re-purposed boards form a rustic ceiling that damps the sound just enough so that the place feels lively, yet you can have a conversation without shouting. Lighting is excellent. The industrial touches complement the old brick, and the signage is painted in a way that looks just worn enough to feel relaxing  The price is on the high side of $$, with a bottle of wine, salad and two dishes, we spent $60. Still, I'd come back any time I can, and wonder how good dinner is up under the glassed-in third floor, either open air in the summer, or under the skies in winter.",

I ate veggie meatballs with the spicy tomato sauce and vegetable quinoa. I wasn't expecting the quinoa to be cold, and would have preferred it warm. Good beer selection, even though they were out of what I ordered.   Our server was terrible and we sat at our table for a long time before we had to remind the hostess stand we were there... And the server never introduced herself or even said \"hi.\" It was a little bizarre, but I haven't heard other complaints about the service so it must have been an off night.  Can't wait for the Sienna pizza joint on the second floor...",

I've gotten several combinations of meatballs and sauces and they've all been terrifc. Although the special stuffed pepper meatball was delicious, I would have to say my favorite combination is the classic beef and tomato sauce. It is done well, and it stands on its own. Also, they have a friend pepperoni ball appetizer that is so, so, so good! I could eat two orders myself (and there's a decent amount of time). The beer list doesn't wow, but they do have delicious cocktails, and the bartender made us ad hoc sangria, even though it wasn't on the menu. I would go every week if I could!",

    "text": "The food and ambiance made the biggest impression on me.  This place has a clear vision of what it is and embodies that really well.  Casual/industrial chic with a limited menu of only meatballs.  No kitchen-sink syndrome here.  The lighting was really low, though; trying to squash the dreams of those Instagramming diners.  The downfall for me was the service - definitely didn't leave me with a great impression.  So, the food.  I love meatballs.  I can make my own bomb diggity beef meatball at home, so I went with a turkey meatball slider topped with spinach almond pesto. (I heard from a friend she got a few sliders to try different things and couldn't make it through her second.) I also got a side of escarole and beans.  About halfway through I was thinking \"dang, I could go for another one.\"  The meat was tender and juicy for turkey, though it didn't taste like you just bit off a turkey leg.  The pesto was a perfect compliment to the light meat.  And the slider bun...so fluffy, a little sweet, and perfect.  A harder bun would have squished the meatball - the light bun held the integrity of the ball.  My boyfriend got the Meatball of the Day - a sausage ball with BBQ sauce and coleslaw as a grinder.  Harder bun, heartier meatballs, perfect sauce and meat combo again.  Now, the service. We were here on the early side, around 5, so we had an attentive server in the beginning.  As more people came in, she practically disappeared.  When it came time to ask if we wanted dessert, I said that I could, but I would need to see the menu again.  She came back quickly....with our check.  Okay.  She's busy, it's cool, we'll just have another beer.  So I went to the bar to grab us another round.  The bartender reprimanded me.  \"If you're sitting at a table, you have to order from your server.\"  I explained she was no where in sight and we wanted to grab something before happy hour ended.  He dismissed me saying the manager would take care of it.  I left the bar and waited a good 5 minutes for our server to bring us our beers.  When she did, we asked about a price on the check.  The draft menu had our beers at $6, but they rang up $6.50.  She told us the menus were reprinted that day and took our check away, I assume to adjust it.  She didn't.  Now, 50 cents isn't a big deal, we just wanted to let them know there was a discrepancy so they could fix it.  After another 15 uncomfortable minutes, we had to ask for our check back - it was getting busy and I felt so awkward holding a table when we could have easily moved to the bar to finish our drinks.  We did and saw that the chalkboards had the price of our beers at $6 as well.  Great food, great place, off night for service.",

    "text": "Is it wrong to be in love with a restaurant? If SM were a person, I'm sure he would be my soul mate. I stopped here a while back on a Saturday mid afternoon for a late lunch. When I walked in, I immediately knew this was my type of place. Modern, casual and chic. The decor reminds me of what would be at a classy backyard bbq. From the combination of stainless steel and glassware to the exposed brick SM will make anyone feel welcome and at ease. And I do mean anyone. Bring the kids, bring grandma, everyone will love it. Now onto the food.  We tried several of the saucy balls. You can order individual balls with different sauces to try out as many combos ad you'd like. And at 3 bucks a ball, you can't go wrong. My favorite was the pork with the arribiata sauce, a yummy and slightly spicy red sauce. I also really enjoyed the garlic parm fries. Think chicken wing but on fresh cut fries. The menu has so much to offer (even vegetarian balls!) and at such reasonable prices, you'll want to bring the family every week. Which brings me to my one and only issue with SM, the location. Despite my love of SM, I doubt I will be back as often as I would l like. Having to find parking downtown, pay and walk a couple blocks to just to get to the restaurant is a large negative for south hillers like me. I wonder if others will feel the same? Hopefully a neighborhood location will be in the works sometime soon.",

They have a great selection of beers on tap which I loved.  They also have a large bar in the back of the restaurant, so if you dont have a reservation you have a place to hang out while waiting.   The meatballs come in 4 different ways.  They come as a slider, a panini, a grinder and just plain with sauce.  I tried the veggie balls with a pesto sauce.  They were super flavorful and the texture was great.  I was very impressed.  My husband tried the beef with a spicy tomato sauce and loved his as well.  We got the mac and cheese as a side to split.  It was tasty as well.   I highly recommend!",

    "text": "Poutine!   The first floor is Emporio, a Meatball joint. I thought the same thing. I went with my judgement in hand and I left with a belly full of Poutine. My friend and I shared this the first time - we now always get our own.    $7 gets you a heafty portion of poutine - You can choose between fries and tater tots - you do what you want, but the tots are the only way to go in my mind. Served with a hearty mound of melted cheese curds and slathered in hot, delicious gravy. (Thanks, Canada!)  I've gotten it with and without a meatball, with and without an egg (ask for it dippy!) and with and without pancetta (they also have bacon). My favorite way is tots and mushroom gravy, no add-ons.  And I'm normally a fan of add-ons. The chicken gravy is good too, but just a tad oily/fatty tasting. The pancetta is made in-house and, in my opinion, it's FAR too salty.  The easy, relaxed atmosphere has a trendy enough vibe to support it's focus on ye ol' meatballs and yet not so trendy that you raise a fist in the air and curse Portland. The servers are all nice and very helpful. The service is FAST!  Emporio has a great selection of beer - my favorite is Lagunitas Cappuccino Porter. Additionally, they have loveable little water glasses at the tables made of recycled water bottles and they leave a large glass bottle of water at the start of service. It's a simple but nice touch.",

    "text": "What can I add to what's already been said?  Three levels, three concepts, all well executed.  My favorite is the street level Emporio, which features an extensive drink menu and even more impressive balls.  Yeah, I said balls and not meatballs.  They're not all made of meat!  There's always at least one or two non-traditional meat variety offered, which is nice for my vegetarian friend, or for me when I happened to come here on a Lenten Friday.  I appreciate that you can mix and match so much with a fairly limited menu.  As for the other two levels, Mezzo and Il Tetto, they are fine establishments as well.  Mezzo is better for a sit down dinner/date, and Il Tetto is a popular spot for the local working stiffs who want to breathe some life into downtown Pittsburgh after 5pm.  I wish I could mix the rooftop garden setting with the Emporio menu, but alas, never the twain shall meet.  And that goes for the middle too.  So, if you were hoping to mix and match, you're out of luck.  However, you can always make a \"progressive\" out of it and wander from floor to floor.  Advance line placement via the No Wait app is recommended on weekends, because they don't do reservations.",

    "text": "Now that I have succeeded in visiting each floor separatetly, I feel authorized to review this awesome place.  With each floor having their own personality and menu, it's easy to see why this place is attractive to diners and night-lifers alike.  Let's start with the first floor--Emporio--known as the meatball joint.  The atmosphere was quaintly industrial and felt comfortable and inviting.  We love to sit at bars so that's what we did.  The bartenders were friendly and helpful as I navigated their gin offerings.  They shook a good martini---win!  The meatballs we tasted were flavorful and portioned well. Coming from a family of amazing meatball-makers and being a pretty good meatball maker myself, this is a good review!   The 2nd floor was also inviting but felt a little more \"restauranty\" to us---which is not a bad thing (but it's the best way I could describe it).  We decided on the Margherita pizza and the butcher's board and a lovely red wine (recommended by our wait person).  Although we could have made more adventuresome picks, we really enjoyed the simplicity and freshness of the meal.  Floor 3-- Il Tetto--was actually my personal favorite spot.  It's fun and eclectic and highlights the city in a different way than many other night spots and restaurants. We try to have drinks there when we can (it can get really really crowded so you have to choose the timing very carefully).  The bartenders are more casual than Emporio but nontheless good with the martini shaker.   Sienna Mercato is an excellent venue that's positioned well in the city.  It's a feel good place.....which is always a good thing!",

We visited this place on a busy Saturday night and it was packed. Loud by fun atmosphere. Classic Beef with arribiatta, Spicy Pork with creamy parmesan, Chicken with spinach-almond pesto all delish however the Beef was a little bland. I got them in slider form but I would have preferred them In the Saucy Balls. The problem is you cannot mix your balls. With this many choices you should have an option that lets you sample more balls at a time. That would be my only criticism. on the other hand the mushroom arancini were so good I would go back just for them. we also had the tomato risotto and escarole & beans were adequately prepared but nothing to brag about. Plenty of fine drafts on tap and when I say excellent service, I mean it.  I can't wait to go back and try the upper levels. Note to owner: BALL SAMPLER!",

I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could - lots of vegetarian options (I had Tomato Risotto and Beans & Greens, both delish), very decently priced, big but not sterile atmosphere, etc. Only thing lacking is the option to order carafes of cheap house wine - this place has the perfect casual vibe to call out for cheap wine, but everything is priced by the glass at $8 and above. Management, change that one thing, and Emporio would be totally perfect!! Regardless, I'd recommend this great downtown option.",

The downstairs is an Italian themed meatball restaurant that was packed, so it must be pretty good. Haven't tried that part yet. The second floor offers something a little different, so you get three restaurants in one. Pretty cool. Only negative I can say is that the beer prices were a little high.",

I am a sucker for Bloody Marys, so I had four... don't judge. We were seated right next to the garage door .  I didn't complain much but personally, that like there was a pretty big draft coming through and for not being crowded at all  would have liked to be seated more in the restaurant then on the outskirts . I decided to go with the Italian Wedding soup and a Caesar salad. I thought the Caesar salad was delicious. Wedding soup was good... Nothing spectacular, but still tasty. For my entree, I ordered the poutine. It was delicious and filling. My husband went with the poutine as well, but added bacon and a sunny side up egg. He also got the pork meat ball as well as the pepperoni meatball. Both were very delicious but also pretty heavy. We were unable to finish our shopping once we had this meal. But we will be back!",

    "text": "Sienna Mercato is a restaurant in a three-story building with a different dining concept on each level. During my trip to a conference in downtown Pittsburgh, only the first level, Emporio, was completed and open for business.  Emporio's concept is gourmet meatballs and I'm usually the last person to order meatballs because they are usually lacking taste and come with the standard marinara sauce. When this place popped up on my restaurant search, I was actually excited to see something other than the standard meatball on the menu.  I tried this place and liked it so much the first time that I went for a second trip.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a vegetarian \"meatball\" on the menu as well which had a good taste and flavor. You can add a meatball to a salad or a soup or you can order one of their meatball sandwich options with your choice of sauce. If that's not enough, they also have a great variety of side dishes that you can add to your meal. The only issue was the slow service on both visits but this place made enough of an impression that I will definitely go back!",

There actually aren't many gf options- there is gf pasta and sauce and only one kind of meatballs. The salads-which you would think would be gluten free, are not listed as such so they must not be. I thought the tomato sauce was sour and acidic and gross. The pasta was edible but the meatballs were mushy. I was really unhappy with this place as they make a big deal about being gluten free friendly but they do not deliver the goods. This was our last night in Pittsburgh and a friend of mine raved about this place, but my experience was terrible and left a bad taste in my mouth. If you are looking for gluten free options, look elsewhere.",

What I loved most about the restaurant was the atmosphere of the restaurant! We sat in the Mezzo portion of Sienna Mercato. There are 2 other parts to Sienna Mercato including a meatball restaurant and a rooftop bar. The service was good, our waitress was very nice and informative. Receiving refills was a little slow but they were super busy, especially considering it was 2 days before Christmas. The food is different. It's definitely more of a swanky place. We tried one of the cheese and meat boards they offer. I really like that they receive all of their ingredients from local farms. They butcher, smoke, and cook the meat right there, so you know you're getting your food fresh! I would definitely say to give it a try! I want to try their meatball restaurant!",

I'm giving it 3 stars because I'm really hard to please when it comes to Italian food and also, their fries and Brussels sprouts were on the greasy side. But let me tell you, you won't leave this place with an empty belly. I was more than full. I got the regular meatball panini with marinara sauce and a side of fries. I also ordered the \"crack sauce\" which is ranch and hot sauce mixed and that was AWESOME! The fries were enough to feed a table of 6, not sure why that portion is so large. My coworker got a side of Brussels sprouts and those were delicious but extremely greasy and made my stomach hurt. My other coworker got tater tots and those were yummy but also very rich, would hurt my stomach, too. I think the meat balls weren't as seasoned as a real meatball should be but that's just my opinion and I'm a harsh critic when it comes to that.   One thing, though, that makes me also put this place at a 3 is the noise level. It is so loud in this place and it doesn't help that the employees who clean the tables drag the seats across the floor - metal against cement. They literally drag them and then it sounds like they're throwing them back down onto the floor to put them in place. It made it hard to have a conversation without yelling.   All in all, I would say yes, try this place out if you don't know what homemade Italian is.",

Then down to meatball Emporio for dinner. BTW, you can use no wait while upstairs and take them elevator down. Our timing was perfect in that table was ready as we were walking out of bar. We love this placd, it's definitely one of our favorites! Even though we live closers to their Wexford location and have enjoyed visits there, the main location on Penn is preferred.",

Definitely thought that it would be more packed than it was but it was fine.  Downtown parking can be a bit of a headache. If you can find street parking for free on a Sunday I totally recommend it. However there is valet parking across the street. So I would with a group of 4. I ordered the saucy balls! They are huge and come with 4 meatballs. I got a side of spaghetti with it. You can choose what type of meat you want and I got 2 pork and 2 beef with Arabiatta sauce! Deeelisshuus! And very filling!   The only downside was my waitress, after repeating my order to me, forgot 2 of my balls and only brought me two. And still charged me for the other two! And when she brought out the second 2, she didn't bring any sauce. I didn't like having to ask for my order again.   I did get a drink, a manhattan. It was good, but a bit pricey for Pittsburgh, $14.   Overall, I enjoyed the food, service was ehh.",

    "text": "I've experienced all three restaurants at Sienna Mercato on numerous occasions, and I am definitely a fan. Emporio (the meatball joint) is a five-star spot for me. The food is so consistently good, they have a great beer selection, a great Happy Hour, and it's pretty affordably priced. They also have Meatball Monday featuring $2 sliders. It's an amazing excuse to go there on a Monday! I really enjoy their rotating Ball of the Month - my favorite was a veal marsala that I believe they had last month.  Mezzo is kind of hit or miss. I've had good meals there, but I've also had risotto that was way underdone (Gordon Ramsay would not be pleased). The service is always good, but quite honestly I would rather eat at the less-bougie meatball level just because every experience I've had there has been so on point!  Il Tetto is a great rooftop bar. I've had a few snacks there - nothing to write home about but better than your standard bar fare. I am always impressed with the beer selection and their cocktails are delicious! This is a great place to take friends from out of town, though it does get busy on weekends.  Overall this is a solid place. Though it's been here for years and other concepts keep popping up nearby, I continue to come back!",

Both times, we had to get on a waiting list for \"45 minutes,\" when we could see that there were multiple tables open for 2. After 10 minutes or so, they call you up. They encourage you to use some app for getting in line, but I'm not sure why they give such an overestimated wait time. So, don't be discouraged if they give you a ridiculously long wait time!  The atmosphere - it's pretty loud, but you can have a conversation if you talk loudly.  The food: 1st floor - The meatballs are OK and reasonably priced. I got the spicy pork meatball slider and the beef meatball slider. Both meatballs were a bit dry. I liked the flavors in the spicy pork meatball - the beef meatball was a bit average, nothing special. I'm a bit curious to try their doughnuts, otherwise I won't be coming back here.  2nd floor - They use a lot of salt here. I tried a pizza, pasta, and the cured meats. I wasn't impressed by the cured meats, but the pasta and pizza were great. I wish they weren't so salty, but I would definitely go back to try more of their pasta and pizzas. TIP: the half pasta dishes are actually pretty substantial! I'd definitely get the half pasta for just myself. For two people, a pizza should be satiating enough, but you'd be full sharing a half pasta and a pizza. I'd love to go back with a group of 3-4 girls and to try a bunch of the half pastas together.",

I stand by my raving reviews of The Meatball Shop so I had to try it out and compare. I had two sliders- Classic Beef with marinara sauce and Vegetarian (mushroom, white bean, cauliflower) with spinach almond pesto.   Overall, the meatball sliders were ok. They were all about quantity than quality. Meatball was pretty big, but the taste was underwhelming. I'd go there again to try out their other items like the cured meats and pasta. They also have a beer garden on the rooftop. But I don't think I'd go get their meatballs again.",

    "text": "I visited on a Tuesday night and it was relatively uncrowded. I love the industrial design of the restaurant-the \"garage door\" opens when the weather is nice too. We were greeted immediately upon walking in and The hostess seating us gave a very good overview of the menu, filled our water glasses, and left the carafe on the table (which I always like). Service started off shaky-we were waiting for a good 10 minutes when our server came over and apologized for the wait, thanked us for being patient, and added she was having a computer issue and couldn't find anyone to help her. Having worked in food service before, I'm very understanding and wasn't bothered by this as I've had the same issue. She took our drink order and those were promptly brought to our table (I had the Boulder Mojo a nitro IPA and my boyfriend had an Old Brown Ale). They have a decent draft selection-lots of IPAs which I love. Most are between $5.50-$7 so typical Pittsburgh prices. We started off with the buffalo fried chicken balls with blue cheese and celery. The celery was shredded and blended with the blue cheese which topped the fried chicken balls. They were delicious-had a definite kick to them-and there were 6 balls so it was perfect for sharing. For our entrees we both decided to do 2 sliders (since you can't do multiple types of meatballs in any of the serving options-that was my one negative). We both did a meatball of the day slider. The meatball of the day was a ground beef/corned beef mix topped with saurkraut and stone ground mustard. WOW! It was perfectly pink in the middle-how I like it-and the flavors blended together perfectly! My boyfriend chose a spicy pork slider with Arribiatta sauce which he said was very good. I chose a chicken meatball with the tzatziki sauce and again-WOW! The tzatziki sauce was probably the best I've ever had and I really liked the flavors in the chicken meatball. After that hiccup in the beginning, service was great-we were checked on at exactly the right points during our visit, our glasses were always full, after we finished the plates were immediately cleared. She was very talkative and friendly and made a great suggestion on the Boulder mojo I had. We had a great experience from start to finish (minus that hiccup with waiting for our server at first) so do not hesitate to make your way down to Emporio for some delicious meatballs-we will absolutely be back for a return visit.",

I will admit the meatballs were very good, however was the sides that really downgraded this restaurant to me. The Caesar salad was terrible. The dressing was way too fishy, and way too much was put onto the salad.  The Parmesan and herb fries were rather bland undercooked and just not very good.  I am not from the area and likely won't patronize on future trips to Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I took my boyfriend to Mezzo tonight for his birthday for the Italian food he was desperately craving. We saw how positive the reviews were and I was confident that we would have an awesome meal and great service. I can say we got 50% of that equation. The server, Vanessa, was awesome and even recommended a good place to grab drinks after the meal. I would actually love to hang out with her because she was a fellow Scorpio. However, I digress, let me walk through the food we ordered. We opted to try the Italian cheese tray. This tray doesn't not come with bread, so we did a small order of bread. The cheeses ranged from sweet and mild all the way to putrid and potent. This was an interesting spread and we enjoyed trying out all of the different types. We were off to a good start. After that, we opted for the sofrita pizza and a Caesar salad with Prosciutto on top. This was alright, however I don't think that salted meats are our thing. The sofrita pizza sauce was all but dried up underneath mozzarella slices and mushroom stems. The sauce I would describe as concentrate from a spaghetti-o's can. Very sweet and honestly dried up. I think next time we will opt for downstairs at Emporio to sample more mainstream fare, however we will miss Vanessa upstairs at Mezzo. Lastly, the ambiance is amazing. If I could've made dinner and brought it to the Mezzo dining room, that would've made for a perfect night!",

But if you're a True meatball fan there will be a tear in your eye when you leave. You pick the meat, the seasoning, the sauce and how you cook them. You can choose to put them over a side if you want or you can just eat the plain. Can't remember the mix I opted for but I can tell you it was amazing. To this day I still dream about my plate. I got the meatballs plain (not over anything) and was full, but I don't normally eat much. So if you're used to a hefty meal I'd probably spring for spreading the meatballs over a side of something. Definitely a place anyone would be pleased eating at.",

First, the doors were wide open and it was at least 80 degrees and very humid in the restaurant (90 degree day in August) but it was just about the only place open for dinner late at night.  We asked the waiter for a table in a \"cool\" (meaning, with some AC) spot in the restaurant - i would hate to see what the other options were.  We ordered a variety of starters to try - the cheesy bread, pickle chips and Caesar salad.  the cheesy bread was ok, literally just crusty bread with some cheese and marinara for dipping, i wouldn't order it again. the pickle chips had no taste except that of salt.  we probably each had one bite and then pushed it to the side of the table to forget about.  the Caesar salad was actually really good, yet simple.  the dressing tasted slightly lemony and i really enjoyed it.  i then tried a single turkey meatball slider which was, again, just ok.  the meatball itself had no flavor, but the marinara packs a punch.  we had a lot of leftover food but the waiter never inquired about whether anything was ok or asked how the food was.  the only thing that i would order again was the salad, which means I probably won't be returning to Sienna Mercato.",

The downtown food scene has been getting more and more expensive, but Emporio, on the first floor bucks that trend, and brings the price point of a quality dinner in the Cultural District down to a reasonable level. The drinks and drafts can get expensive, but food wise, they have made it very affordable.   The food is also nothing short of fantastic. The \"must have\" item for us is the tomato risotto, which has an amazing flavor and is portioned well enough to serve two,  even if it is a single portion in the menu.   The waits can be rough, but they do use No Wait, though sometimes the estimated time is very misleading.",

Just general hostess and wait staff were rude as well on other occasions. Food is not particularly enjoyable. There's not a lot of options beside the huge meatballs.

Appetizers that were ordered included the hot sausage balls and the poutine with chicken gravy and the tater tots. We did ask the waitress that ran our food to find out if the cheese curds were pasteurized and she never got back to us which was slightly annoying as I was not able to take part in enjoying the appetizer.  I ordered a single slider with the pork meatball and the mushroom gravy which was very delicious and a side ordered of the macaroni and cheese in government cheese sauce that was delicious!

As it was pretty busy we didn't mind as it seemed pretty popular so we decided to go have a drink at the bar. We ended up sitting down at the bar and ordered food from there.  I ordered the beef meatballs with creamy parmesan with spaghetti and my partner ordered beef meatballs with marinara sauce with penne, amazing!  For dessert we had the ricotta doughnuts and again they were amazing!  The also have a wide selection of local beers which we loved and it's great to try local beers.

Place was bustling with energy and plenty of lively end of day conversations. I ordered the Italian Wedding Soup, a classic marina beef meatball slider and a pork with bolognese slider. Food came out freakishly fast with each slider in individual metal bowls. The wedding Soup was simply prepared with Escarole, Pastina, Parmesan and a few pieces of chicken. I wasn't expecting too much and I wasn't disappointed. The classic marina slider underwhelmed, but the pork bolognese made up for its slider compatriot. After blowing through the sliders with a combined spend of only $9 and a bit of room left in the stomach, I ordered an additional Almond Pesto Chicken Slider to round things out. The Pesto was great and probably prepared fresh and in house; easily my favorite of the three sliders. Overall, I felt like this could be a cool place to grab a craft beer and enjoy conversation with colleagues, but on this night I came alone with low expectations and left with full stomach. The bonus was that I only spend $11 on food and won't even need to submit a receipt for the expense report...",

My daughter and my husband both ordered the tomato basil cream sauce, which had absolutely NO CREAM in it at all! It was just plain tomato pasta sauce with dried basil sprinkled on top. Tomato cream sauce is usually pink in color, and you can clearly taste the cream. The mushroom sauce, that I had, tasted like it came from a can. Also, their portions were BEYOND SMALL! That evening, all three of us got food poisoning from their disgusting food, and we spent the entire evening in the bathroom. I can't remember ever getting so sick on food!! Please don't eat here! I don't want anyone to get as sick as we were. I called the next day to let the manager know what happened, and he told me that he was sorry that we got so sick, but there was nothing he could do about refunding our money or compensating us for the bacteria infested food. He also told me that they know that their vegetarian meatballs are hard and dry, because of how they make them. Why in the world would you continue to serve hard, dry meatballs to your customers? Even frozen vegetarian meatballs from the grocery stores are better than the ones Sienna Mercato is serving! We are having my daughter's leftover meatballs tested by the health department to see what type of bacteria caused all of our intestinal problems.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to check out this place for a while, and was so glad we got the chance to last night!    First floor is a meatball joint, second floor is a charcuterie/pizza/Italian restaurant, and top floor is a rooftop bar. We ate at the second floor of this three floor establishment.  As we had arrived prior to the rest of our dinner partners, I went for their version of an Italian margarita with tequila.  It was very sweet, tasty, but was lacking much of an alcohol kick surprisingly.  When our friends arrived, we ordered the small charcuterie board and the small Pennsylvania cheese board.  Man, these were amazing!!!  I loved every cheese and every meat, even the more adventurous ones like the rabbit based one.  The server who brought out the boards went through each meat and cheese with us and told us how to incorporate the accompaniments along with the meat and cheese.  Next time, I'd probably order the large ones because I liked it so much!!  Of note, when ordering the meat and cheese board, the waitress asked if we'd liked bread, which out of habit I said yes.  Well apparently, the bread is extra and we did get charged for it, which for an Italian restaurant, I thought was a bit much.  Alongside my dinner I had a glass of pinot noir which was really delicious and complimented to pasta and pizza we had ordered really well.  My fiance and I split their sausage pizza and shrimp fra diavolo for our entree. The pizza toppings were yummy, but we both found the crust to be a little lackluster.  Not bad by any means, but not at the level some other local woodfired pizza places are.  Now the pasta...the pasta.  OMG. So. Good.  First marinara sauce I've ever tasted that is as close to my mom's Italian family recipe.  The pasta was perfectly al dente, shrimp perfectly cooked.  I literally could have put my face in this dish.  AMAZING.  We skipped out on dessert in favor of grabbing a beer downstairs at the Meatball Emporio level.  Great craft beer choice!  I got the Yard's Love Stout and it might just be my new favorite!  The ambiance of the whole restaurant was awesome.  It did have a bit of a hipster vibe, but was warm and welcoming.  The service was also above and beyond most.  Overall, I will definitely be back, especially for the wine, meat, cheese, and pasta!!",

    "text": "A few co-workers and I went here shortly before the holidays for a Christmas lunch. What's really interesting about this place is its like three places in one; they have the meatball joint, a charcuterie & pizza place and a beer garden on the roof. I love meatballs. Like, really, really love them, so that was clearly where I was going to focus my calories.  It was pretty crowded and kickin' when we got there and this was just a couple days before Christmas, so I can only imagine how it is when downtown Pittsburgh is at full capacity.   Most of the menu (on the meatball side) is a \"pick your own\" type. You pick the kind of meatball you want, the kind of sauce, the serving option and a side. One really nice feature is they have quite a few vegetarian/gluten free options.  Two of the ladies got the panni, which is a two ball sandwich. The third got a salad w/a meatball and I...dropped the ball again (no pun intended). I ordered the mac'n'cheese with a single turkey meatball. Now, it was good, very good actually, but I am just not a pasta person, and why on earth I ordered it is beyond me.  The pasta was good and creamy, and the meatball was very good; nicely seasoned and tender. I just wish I would have gotten a panni or even a couple sliders (they are the 1 ball sandwich) and tried different ball & sauce combos. The one woman did get the parm-herb fries though and shared; they were super yummy.   I fully intend to try this place again and I feel like it will totally upgrade to a four or five star review.        *note* if the word \"balls\" makes you giggle, be prepared when you read the menu.",

    "text": "The only reason this gets one star is because I cannot give it 0. After a Pirate game, my friends and I decided to check out the great rooftop and have a couple drinks. The scenery was beautiful however the service was very ugly. Sadly, in the year of 2015, the bar manager made a \"judgment call\" that the only African American person with us could not be served because he appeared \"intoxicated\". There were multiple people with us who in fact were intoxicated but the bar manager had no problem serving them because they were white. After going to get the manager to discuss this issue, she apologized for the oversight and said that he was indeed NOT intoxicated and could be served. The bar manager still refused to serve him and the manager informed us that she could not force her staff to serve anyone. We decided to leave due to the unacceptable treatment we had received. My friend who was refused service kindly thanked the manager, shook her hand, and then we left. The treatment he received was not only degrading but outright racist and yet he responded with the utmost respect and dignity. I will post this on every social media sight I can to make sure everyone knows just what kind of \"bar manager\" is on staff here. If you would like to spend your money at a place that condones racism, then this is your restaurant!",

    "text": "Let me tell you: I was very excited that there was a place solely dedicated to meatballs. Although I have limited exposure to homemade meatballs, I really enjoyed the meatballs from Emporio (Sienna Mercato). Their concept for their meatballs is equivalent to Subway. What I mean by this is that you get to choice every single step of your entree. You start off by choosing the type of meat, then the sauce, what type of vehicle you want your meatball to be in, and optional sides. I ordered the classic beef with marinara sauce as a meatball slider and got the tomato risotto as a side. The meatball itself was very large and I was full after the slider. My one complaint would be the tomato risotto. Unlike other risottos I have tried, I could tell that the rice had been par-cooked and then added to the sauce which is not how a traditional risotto is made. As a tip of the restaurant, I would not advertise \"tomato risotto\" if it is not cooked in the risotto technique. Other than that, I would definitely go back and try the many combinations!",

We asked since we just had dinner could we go up to the rooftop. We were told we could but we needed to wait in the 25 minute line. Just an unfortunate situation and management really doesn't care. Completely useless. Just a standard manager without any form of professional management background. Unfortunate. May go back.

Our night started on the 2nd floor with a server who didn't know what Stoli was...literally, no idea that it was a vodka. After 5 of us drank all of our water...we had to prompt her to bring us l more...especially since drinks were forgotten about and took forever to arrive at the table. After waiting 30 minutes for our dinners to arrive, the \"manager,\" if you'd call her that, came to our table to tell us they were out of an ingredient used in one of the daily specials we ordered...she said they were substituting said ingredient for mushrooms. When the 2 people in my party that ordered the dish both said they didn't want mushrooms in their dish, the manager had to go ask the chef if that was ok. Since when do we live in a world where the chef tells you if you will or will not be eating a certain ingredient...like they didn't have an option?  Not to mention the fact that our dinners should have been on the table at that point...not even started yet I'm assuming. Food was actually pretty good when it finally made it to the table...except for the fact that the server told us if we wanted a different dressing for our salad that we ordered SOS that we would be charged. So we have to pay extra because your gross pesto dressing just isn't cutting it? Cool. $2 for a tablespoon worth of dressing. Anywho...when the bill came, we asked her to split it evenly 3 ways with our credit cards. This is a simple operation for any operating system...I know because I work in the restaurant industry. She somehow charged 2 of us for $50 and 1 of us $100. It was pretty obvious that this restaurant needs some tweeking. When I spoke to the manager on the way out the door she could have cared less. I guess that's what these types of restaurants are turning into now...they just don't care about the quality of the service or the satisfaction of the customers...because people are going to go there regardless.  Bad experiences are shrugged off and ignored because their sales are good and the money is coming through the door. Pretty sad if you ask me. The manager didn't even try to make things right...and she never did a single table check to see how things were going with our meal and service. Needless to say we were not impressed...and we will not return. Not that it matters to them...",

They lose three stars for each time my wife got yelled at for not following proper foot traffic patterns in the restaurant (apparently she took the wrong lane back to her seat from the bathroom?). We were told a 25-minute wait for a seat, but assented since a friend had recommended. We made our way to the elevator for the beer garden (after being shooed off the stairs) and only stood there for 5 minutes with a bunch of other people waiting for the slowest elevator before we got a text that our seat was ready. Except it wasn't actually ready. We stood at the host table another 5 minutes. It was there that we noticed the strange division of labor: hostesses were delivering food and tending bar; wait staff were seating people. It seemed like no one was really clear what they were supposed to be doing. When we were seated, we were finally greeted by someone who acted like she wanted us there. Our waitress took drink orders, came back to take our food orders. The appetizer arrived soon after...before the beers even. Then my wife's entree arrived at an incredibly quick interval, almost as though they had predicted her order. Then the waitress arrived with a confused look, which she attributed to my wife having her food and my not having mine. She went to figure it out and came back with a \"computer error\" explanation. Whatever the explanation, if my wife had continued to eat at her normal pace, she would have finished before my food ever came. By the time my food came, our dinner was already not worth it. Like I said, the food was good; our waitress was super apologetic and didn't charge for poutine (we added that money to her tip). I would try it again, but only if the illogical process to obtain one's food and the pretentious attitudes of a majority of the staff get straightened out.",

I wasn't entirely sure of what the format of the place was until I went. The first floor is a more casual restaurant where they specialize in meatballs. The second floor is a little fancier full service restaurant (by fancy, I don't mean dress wise. You'd still be fine wearing jeans. But it's a \"fancy\" full italian menu). I think there is a beer garden on the third level. I've not tried the meatball part of Mercato or the beer garden, but after how great the first experience was, I'll definitely be back to try both.  We ordered a small cheese and small meat board to start. Both are great appetizers. For my dinner I had the lamb & tagliatelle pasta. It was amazing. If you've never been, it's good to keep in mind they cook all their past al dente..which is how it should be! But some people aren't used to it. They also butcher all their meat in-house..and it's farm-to-table! Very cool.   Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful. I also loved the atmosphere. Great place to eat downtown!",

You can choose to visit 3 different levels here: 1st level is dedicated to meatballs (comfort food made gourmet), 2nd level is dedicated to charcuterie and cheese and pizza and the 3rd level is this romantic and roof top bar. It's a great spot to snack, feast and/or drink, what else could you ask for?",

From the photos and reviews of their other restaurants, I expected that the pizza would be delicious, and it looked like it would've been from the photos. The crust was a bit too soft for me and the sauce tasted like it was right out of the can and slopped onto the pizza without any seasoning at all. I don't know what it was about the pizza but it just tasted pretty half ass to me. I can find better thin crust style pizza in the Midwest. Go somewhere else for pizza and don't waste your time or money here!",

    "text": "Sienna Mercato's latest creation, Mezzo, is somewhere between Emporio and Il Tetto both literally and figuratively.  On the second floor, the final installment of this saga is a blend of small plates and pizza that fills a gap between the informal meatball madness of Emporio on the first floor and the stuck up tapas of Il Tetto on the rooftop.  Service was actually exemplary for a restaurant that has been open for two days.  We were immediately greeted and I feel as if at no point, we were left out to dry (charcuterie pun).  As for food, we ordered an appetizer (mushrooms, cheese and toast), a pizza (mushroom, egg, pork, truffle etc) and pork risotto.  With the exception of the appetizer, every dish had a great level of complexity that I'd definitely come back for.  The wine list is average on price point, with the cheapest bottle of a decent red calling around $30.  The atmosphere is solid, with Sienna's outdoor theme continuing through a large set of garage doors that were open to the elements.  Lots of exposed bricks added to the scene as well.  Overall this place reminds me a lot of Butcher and the Rye.  As with Il Tetto, Emporio's incredible 1/2 off happy hour DOES NOT carry over.  Overall, I can see this joint filling a gap in our staple of restaurants, but I also probably won't actively seek it out over a few other options downtown.",

    "text": "I'm sad to report that my experience at Sienna Mercato (Mezzo) was disappointing. I'm usually in agreement with Yelp ratings (those that have many reviews), but my experience last night was not a four star experience.   First, I have to say that the service was good. Our first server left, but a co-worker took over his tables and she was super nice. My boyfriend and I ordered a Lamb Sugo (which had paccheri, a tube shaped pasta similar to rigatoni) and a Tartufo pizza to share. The pizza had ricotta and other cheeses, mushrooms, truffle, and chives on it, but was so bland. I rarely add salt or additional seasoning to food at restaurants, but we had to ask for salt and pepper because this pizza was not flavorful at all. The server asked if al dente was ok for the pasta and I said yes. However, the pasta that came out to us was way undercooked. It was hard to cut into and you could see the white in the middle that wasn't cooked. We had to send it back. I really don't like sending food back, but we couldn't eat it as it was. Even though the second Lamb Sugo they brought out was ok, the best thing we ate was actually taking the bland pizza and throwing some of the pasta sauce with lamb on it. Weird, but it was good pizza crust and the sauce was flavorful, so combining the two was better than eating each by itself. We also got a tiramisu to share, and while it was scrumptious, the portion was tiny. I think we both got about three bites. The other food was well portioned; it's too bad the best part of the meal wasn't.   The ambiance of the place is great. I love the lighting and casual yet classy vibe. I just expect a lot more from a place that got such rave reviews. (One note is that a lot of the rave reviews are for the meatballs, so it's possible that I need to go back to Sienna Mercato but hit up the Emporio section.)",

    "text": "SETTING: Dimly lit, with a brick wall backdrop donning the Sienne Mercato logo. Pretty snazzy atmosphere. You can go casual or take it up a notch.  FOOD: \"A meatball joint\".  Emporio is a unique place that specializes in meatballs.  Step 1: choose a type of meatball (I liked beef; the pork was a little chewy and tough) Step 2: choose sauce  Step 3: choose how you want it served (on a slider, panini, etc)  These meatballs are the size of a baby's fist! NOT the size of a typical meatball found in your spaghetti.   Let's do some simple math: 2 meatball sliders + 1 side/appetizer is a perfect amount. Believe me, I thought I would still be hungry with this order, but it was definitely more than enough. 2 densely packed meatballs + 1 side/appetizer of heavy carbs = a bloated stomach.   SERVICE: There are no reservations, so you need to wait it out. Best advice is to come early or late and not during peak dining times unless you can wait 30+ minutes. Service overall was average, nothing that was above and beyond.   IMPRESSIONS: If you are looking for a heavy meal and/or like meatballs, you want to check this place out.  I mean, how many places specialize in big meatballs?!  I enjoyed the beef meatball with the arribiatta sauce served on a slider--soft and delicate, like a meatball should be. The spicy pork was a bit too chewy and tough, so I would not recommend it. Mac and cheese as my slide was awesome, and you can't go wrong with any of the sides. It really is a heavy meal though, so come hungry!",

I had a side salad and a vegetarian meatball slider with spinach almond pesto (which gives you one meatball and one sauce on a bun) and it was plenty of food. The slider was very small, which can be a good thing if you want to try many combinations of meat and sauce. There are many different combinations, and I'm sure there is something for everyone.  Our server, I believe her name was Joanna, was very attentive and took a lot of time to describe how the meatball menu worked.   All in all, I had a good time. The Meatball floor would be good for grabbing a quick bite before a show, as we were in and out in a little under an hour.",

What none of the reviews noted however was that at lunch time, ONLY the ground floor is open, so you're stuck with just the \"meatballs\" menu. I had the beef meatball slider and shared a poutine. The beef meatballs were quite good, although sliders was a misnomer. Sliders should be two separate small sandwiches but instead it was two meatballs on a small sub roll sliced the long way. The meat sauce it came with was quite tasty. The poutine was disappointing though. I love a good poutine and even in Pittsburgh you can find better poutine, for instance at Park Bruges, and the fries at Butterjoint are tastier. The gravy was disappointingly not very flavorful and the fries rather quickly got soggy. I'd probably give it another try but I'd aim for happy hour; I suspect that's the best time of day to eat there. Over $18 for 2-meatball slider order and poutine at lunchtime. Frankly I think that's pretty expensive by Pittsburgh standards.",

We were seated very quickly, had room to stash our stroller at the entrance (out of the way) so that we didn't awkwardly have it at our table and had great seats near the big open window. There were lots of other little kids there (right after the kids marathon) so I was happy that we weren't the only ones bringing a little kid to such a trendy place.   I wish our server had helped us navigate the menu more as we weren't sure what would fill us up. Next time we'll ask more questions. We also wished we could mix our balls and sauces. We did, however, enjoy saying balls for the entire meal.   I had one turkey slider with the pork bolognese and the arancini rice ball appetizers. My husband had the 4 saucy turkey balls with the pesto and plain fries (omg the fries were amazing!) and our friend tried two different sliders. Overall, we enjoyed our meal but I can't say they were the most amazing meatballs I've ever had. We will definitely be back though because the menu was extensive and I still need to try out the 2nd floor. We attended an engagement celebration on the roof in the fall and enjoyed our appetizers and drinks, and of course the view!",

It has so much going for it really, il tetto and mezzo and MEATBALLS. I've been to all three establishments and love them all! I can honestly say for how busy they get, I have never had an issue with bad service and that's a big deal.   On my most recent visit, I ordered the ground chicken meatballs with the crack sauce (hot sauce and ranch). That took everything to the next level. You get 4 balls and they make it extra saucy which I love. If you want to throw a side of tater tots in that will be an additional charge so make note of that.",

The food presentation kinda lacked and the meatballs looked really dry. BUT I was completely wrong. The meatballs weren't dry at all and they were full of flavor.  Also the portion size is kinda small and I didn't think it was going to be enough food however it was actually more than enough. The food is very filling so no worries on the portion size.  A great combination is the veggie meatballs with mushroom gravy overtop the parmesan fries.  I will definitely be back to try different combinations.",

It's an awesome concept- there are three floors and each floor has a different menu. I never ordered food here, but would love to do so in the future. We came here for a friend's birthday and sat on the rooftop. It was a gorgeous night, making it the perfect spot to be. It was really crowded, and I think that's the norm here- so be prepared. They had a decent selection of beers, so I tried a few local brews I haven't had before. Their prices were normal for downtown, meaning a little more expensive than what you might find in south side or surrounding areas. Overall, we had a great time. I hope to return to check out their huge meatballs!",

Their rooftop bar is only opened on the weekends during the colder months. I mean, I get it, but it's sad.   Each floor is a different type of restaurant, which is a unique vibe for Pittsburgh. I have eaten at Emporio a handful of times, and I have been to the rooftop bar, but I've never gone to Il Tetto. At Emporio, I always get meatball sliders - the pesto sauce is my go-to on a  beef or chicken meatball. They are small enough to try a few, and if you're like me you will still have some room for a side. The tomato risotto is seriously everything. The mac and cheese with the creamy parm sauce is also a good side choice, but honestly just get the risotto. You won't regret it.   The rooftop bar has an awesome vibe for a happy hour any time of the year. During the winter, it is only open on the weekends which has tripped my plans a few times. They have a decent beer and cocktail selection. I haven't gotten wine there, but I think they have decent choices in that department too. The prices are what you would expect for a more upscale place downtown.",

They have an amazing deal where you can pick a small/medium dish+large dish+dessert for only $35! It's a lot of food and enough for two people to share. We got the arugula salad, the seafood pasta and for dessert the peanut butter and chocolate terrine. We also go the butchers meat charcuterie. We also decided to get a second dessert-the name which I forget-but was like a brownie souffle! Everything was SO delicious! My only complaint was one of the workers who kept coming by too often trying to take plates away before we even finished eating. By the third time she came by, when we hesitated to hand over our meals which we were still eating, she made an annoyed face! Finally we decided to give up and just give her our half eaten plates. Other than the over zealous employee taking away our food too soon, everything else was great!",

They showed me the elevators to the beer garden (it's in the back) and the best spot to view the skyline (also in the back).

    "text": "This review is for the first level: EMPORIO, the meatball joint.  A tradition we have when we go on the road to watch our hockey team is to have a pasta dinner on our first night.  I found Sienna Mercato on yelp, and said the place was about 0.4 miles from our hotel, and the hotel had a shuttle that could take up to 11 of us. This restaurant is divided into three floors, the first floor is a meatball restaurant, second floor is a charcuterie and pizzeria, and a top floor is a beer garden. The third floor is on the roof, but the room is enclosed in glass.  Reservations can only be made for the second floor restaurant, and since there were 20 of us, it took a while for a table as it was first come first serve. The staff was very nice and tried to accommodate us with two tables of 10. While we waited for the table, we went to the rooftop to get some drinks, but we had to wait for a table to free up as well.   Fortunately, It took about 45-minutes to get my text message our tables were ready. We were seated adjacent to each other, but with different servers.   The downstairs level wasn't very large, so we were quite fortunate to have our group in just 2 tables.  The menu had a variety of things, but I wanted to try all their meatballs, so Stephen and I shared a combination of them:  Pork with pork Bolognese, and the BOM (ball of the month ) with marinara, Vegetable ball with govt cheese, the Turkey meatball with mushroom gravy, and my favorite of all, the classic beef meatball with the spinach-almond pesto.  What I didn't realize until we paid was our meatballs were the same price as sliders.  Basically, we were not given our bread. I don't know if it was a miscommunication or an error on the server's part, but we left on a rather sour note.    Overall, everyone enjoyed their meal.  The service was decent, despite the size of our group.  Most of the group had the 4 meatballs with pasta, which was too much for one person.  Perhaps Stephen and I should have split that, or, gone in with others to share a variety of meatballs and pasta. Oh well, there's next time!",

    "text": "Oh Sienna, how I love you. More obsessed than anything, but that's besides the point.   So there three different stories to this place.  Emporio (place to get great meatballs), Mezzo (Italian food), and Il Tetto (rooftop bar area).  Let me start off with Emporio. Now I like to think that I make a damn good meatball, but these people have knocked me out of the park. My usual go to is Saucy Balls. I usually go for the classic beef and spicy pork in the equally amazing marinara sauce (though I like to change it up every once in a while and go for the pork bolognese or government cheese). And of course I have to get the Poutine every time I come (with fries of course).  At Mezzo I tend to stick with their Beef Tartare (which is absolutely amazing), Risotto (always cooked perfectly) or their Veal Polpettes. We typically split a Chocolate Crema Torte if we aren't stuffed by that point. They also have a Pinot that I am absolutely in love with and have to get every time I visit.   Last but not least, is Il Tetto. The rooftop beer garden that is open year round (has some really great views for future reference). This is the place I go when I need a really good cocktail in my life. Or of course, a good beer ( there is a reason they call themselves a beer garden). The bar snacks are pretty good too. A big go to for me no matter where i go is pork rinds, and I must say these are pretty good. The Loaded Fried Potato is pretty good as well (anything with bbq and cheese has my heart).   Service is always excellent and everyone is always so polite and helpful. If you are downtown, I seriously suggest giving this place a try, you wont regret it!",

The second floor which wasn't open during my visit is an upscale Italian restaurant. The top floor is an outdoor bar.  Since I was downtown and had little time to catch a show I opted for eating on the first floor. The waiter was very nice and went over the 5 different types of meatballs they offer. Meatballs are normally $3.50 each but if you are really hungry you can save more if you buy 4 and of course you can make a sandwich out of it.  The meatballs come with your choice of sauce. I decided to go with the chicken meatballs and a side of broccoli with parmesan cheese on top. Believe me those meatballs very delicious and the broccoli spears big and very tasty. Two meatballs as sufficient for me and my waiter very extremely attentive to my needs and my having to be out of there to catch my show.  I really enjoyed eating on the first floor and hope to return in the future to try out their second floor restaurant next time I'm in the city. It is located in the 900 block of Penn Ave downtown and there are other restaurants in the vicinity to try.  Definitely worth the visit! Food was out of this world good!",

    "text": "the atmosphere is wonderful. the food less so.  I went there for the first time with my husband and my parents-in-law. My husband had been there before and he had raved about their food. We made a reservation at Mezzo. We ordered the octopus salad, the grilled shrimp salad, the arugula salad, and then for the main entrees, the fried eggplant, the squid ink pasta, the pork chop, linguini, and orecchiette. The grilled octopus salad was really nice, but really salty--and there were  maybe four or five pieces of octopus next to roasted potatoes and red onion. But this was definitely my favorite! The grilled shrimp salad was delicious, as well. My husband had the pork chop and the arugula salad and he said it was ok, but not great.  However, the fried eggplant was very dry and very salty. I could not eat it, and the server took it back. My parents in law ordered the other pasta dishes, and they said that they were very salty. They barely touched their food. I got the squid ink pappardelle and no matter how much lemon I put on it, it was just horrendously salty.  I felt bad, but I could not eat it. I did not want to send the second dish back to kitchen, but the server noticed that I did not touch it, and offered to take it back and off the bill.  We really appreciated the quality of the service, and especially the server's kindness and excellent customer skills-whose name, I think, was Curtis. A very friendly guy with a hipster beard. He is just a gem!  But I am not sure if I'd want to go back again. Maybe once more to try their pizza? I did love the place, and I would definitely go there for drinks.",

We ate on the first floor, the Emporio: Meatball Joint. My boyfriend and I both got the grinders, which was three meatballs of your choice, cheese, and sauce. I had the chicken meatballs, provolone cheese and crack sauce (ranch and hot sauce!). My boyfriend had beef meatballs, provolone, and marinara sauce. We loved our meals! We also shared tater tots and the Parmesan-herb fries. The fries were great but a large portion, so I recommend sharing! I would love to try the second floor next because they have a more selection on their menu other than meatballs.",

They do get very busy around happy hour, dinner time, weekends etc. Usually a long wait to get up to Il Tetto which seems to be the most popular due to the roof-top bar with views of the city. Mezzo has great italian food, with some seats that look right into the kitchen where they hand-make their dough. My personal favorite is Emporio - an entire menu consisting of Meatballs in all different shapes and forms. Each month they have \"meatball of the month\" which has yet to disappoint, numerous sauces and types of meatballs to keep everyone happy!",

    "text": "Lunch before a home steeler game is the best time to come downtown and try these new restaurants because it's not busy. I have heard things about this place and was interested to try it. They have three floors. The bottom is known for meatballs, the middle is Italian with wood fired pizza and the top is the bar.   Today we had the meatballs. I got the arugula salad with meatballs with sauce on the side. The meatballs were ok. I felt like they needed a little more seasoning/flavor in the meatball. I got the beef, chicken x2, and veggie.   Beef- a little fatty, no visible seasoning   Veggie- more carby than veggie. I could see the beans inside. It was good still but I think they should name it like a \"black bean or Lima bean ball\" not necessarily. \"Veggie\"   Chicken- was the only one with visible seasoning or flavoring inside but it was good  The sauce I got was the almond pesto. I think the almond muted the pesto flavor because I didn't taste it that much. I think they needed some garlic in there.  I would come back here just to try the other offerings you can make but today was eh. The service was great and our server was very helpful and attentive.",

For those of you who haven't been here, you basically pick the type of \"ball\" and what sauce you want and decide if you want it on a sandwich, hoagie, on pasta or just plain in a dish referred to as \"saucy balls.\" They have salads and other apps too.   Wedding soup was okay but nothing to write home about. I will definitely get the veggie balls again which I enjoyed with the tzatziki sauce.

Essentially, you get to build your own meatball - you pick a meat (or the vegetarian option), the way you want it served, and the sauce.   I ordered a chicken meatball slider with arribiatta sauce, which is simply a spicier marinara sauce, and the rocket salad. At a low price of $3.50, the slider was phenomenal; the bread was soft, the meatball was incredibly juicy and well seasoned, and there was just enough sauce to not drown out the flavors of the meatball. The salad was also great, as the arugula was fresh and the balsamic vinaigrette paired well with the mozzarella and almonds on top. The meal wasn't too heavy and left me feeling perfectly satisfied without feeling like I was going to experience a food coma. I loved how flexible the menu is and how accommodating the staff is - you get your food exactly the way you want it. Definitely coming back!",

I wholeheartedly reccomend you can the \"saucy balls\" entree. This means you get four GIANT meatballs (choice of beef, chicken, and vegetarian) in any sauce you can possibly think of (recommend Creamy Parm) OVER traditional pairings like pasta or mashed potatoes but also more creative and delicious alternatives like Tomato Risotto or mac & cheese.   Service was top notch (quick and friendly) which made up for the wait to get in.   Seriously ..go here.",

    "text": "The vibe, the concept, the fantastic service, and, of course, the food will keep you coming back to Sienna Mercato. The restaurant itself is split into 3 floors, each with its own menu and concept. I have frequented Emporio: A Meatball Joint a few times now and just recently stopped into the rooftop beer garden, Il Tetto. The 2nd floor hosts a charcuterie spot called Mezzo, which I have yet to try.  At Emporio, you will find simple yet delicious apps, salads, and a make-your-own meatball experience. Our favorite items include the olive appetizer, the tomato risotto, Parmesan broccoli, tater tots, and of course, various meatballs. My husband was not a fan of the beef meatballs, mainly because they are purely beef and not a mix of meats like most classic recipes call for. He got it on a hoagie roll and said the sauce and bread were the star, not the meat. That being said, the rest of my family enjoyed the spicy pork and chicken meatballs with a host of sauces. Try the spinach almond pesto for a unique meatball topping or the Tzatziki for some Greek-inspired flair.   They also feature a meatball of the month which is always a unique take on a meatball. For example, for the month of June, it was an asian-glazed meatball served with Fried rice.   They have typicals wines, cocktails, and 30+ beers on tap at Emporio and even more upstairs at Il Tetto. You'll find elevated bar snacks at Il Tetto to munch on while you sample some brews.  The prices are reasonable and I've always had quick service!   Notes on Food Allergies: I have a ton of food allergies (wheat, soy, shellfish, eggs, apples, zucchini etc... the list goes on). I usually have a lot of trouble eating at trendy restaurants with my family or spouse, but I was pleasantly surprised by the purity of ingredients here at Sienna Mercato. Everything is homemade, the chefs are well aware of all ingredients and I am always given a swift reply as to what menu items I can enjoy. They use dedicated fryers for their tater tots and french fries and they use Canola Oil (Not soy, not peanut! yay!). Always check with your server before ordering because things can change in the restaurant biz, but so far, I have been able to eat delectable fried goods here without worrying about busting out my Epipen or running to the hospital. Thank you, Sienna Mercato!",

    "text": "What an amazing find during my short stay in Pittsburgh.  Here's how it works: Sienna Mercato is actually 3 separate restaurants, separate menus, AMAZING food, all under one roof. It doesn't get better than that.  On the ground floor is Emporio, known as the \"meatball joint\", and for good reason. These guys know exactly what they're doing, not only with the meatballs, but with their sides and sauces as well. As a first-timer, the menu seemed a little daunting. They essentially allow you to choose your main - either the \"saucy balls\", a selection of 4 of their meatballs, with a choice of sauce over your choice of side(s) or a choice of meatballs in some sandwich-y form, sauce and a side. This may sound simple enough, but all the possible combinations of meatball/sauce/side makes choosing difficult. After much hemming and hawing, and with some help from both hostesses and our waiter, I finally decided on an order of Saucy Balls. I chose the chicken meatballs, with chicken gravy over a side of crispy parm brussel sprouts (my other choice was the chicken meatballs with government cheese over mac and cheese). And when it arrived, it was better than I thought it would be... because, really, how good can meatballs really get? Let me tell you: these fine chefs at Emporio really know their balls. But the real surprise? The BRUSSEL SPROUTS. A close second to my absolute favourite sprouts from San Francisco, and THAT is saying something (those sprouts from SF can be found at North 49 in Burlingame, close to SFO, and are one of my favourite things to eat in the entire world). My only complaint is that once the chicken meatballs and gravy were all done, the sprouts on their own were quite salty (probably due in large part to the pile of parmesan that came with it) and I was unable to finish it. The colleagues I dined with also had the meatball of the month (pepperoni) with the mac & cheese and the Loaded Baked Potato Bowl (beef balls, mashed potatoes and tater tots with government cheese sauce), and all their plates were licked clean! We enjoyed our dinner here so much that a couple nights later, we returned to try...  Mezzo, on the second floor of Mercato - charcuterie and wood-fired pizza, but their selection really included a \"finer\" dining than their sister resto downstairs. Much like my experience on the ground floor, I had a hard time choosing from the menu, everything sounded so good. But the good people at Mezzo have a solution for this dilemma: for $35, you can choose something from their \"small/medium\" (appetizer/salad/antipasti) section of the menu, something from their \"large\" (main) section and it all includes dessert. As recommended by our waitress, I got the Ricotta Gnudi to start, the Boneless Pork Chop and the Chocolate Hazelnut Marjolaine for dessert. The gnudi (ricotta cheese coated in breadcrumb and an apple butter) was okay. I wish I had gone with my gut and ordered the Frutti di Mare instead. My colleague ordered the Salmon Tartare and RAVED about it. But even if he hadn't, his clean plate said it all. The dessert was also just okay, and somewhat disappointing... but the pork chop that arrived in between...THAT was delicious. Easily the best pork chop I've had in a long time. Possibly because I don't typically like pork chop. But this? This was GOOD. The ramp pesto was unexpectedly the highlight of the dish. Highly recommended.  The icing on the cake? Both servers (Anish from Emporio, Emily from Mezzo) as well as the bartender, whose name I didn't get, but mixed me up an AMAZING non-alcoholic drink were all STELLAR. I couldn't recommend Siena Mercato more, either restaurant would be great. (We didn't visit the beer garden on the top, for lack of time, but looking at the menu seems like a small combination of appetizers from both restaurants and drinks).",

I am vegetarian and wasn't sure how the veg meatballs would taste. I went with the server recommendation and she got me 2 meatballs with the tomato risotto. I loved it! For the price the quantity and quality was great! My date and I both were really happy being fed here. Also, the decor is so cute they do have a rooftop beer garden that's open on certain days. I will def be coming back here for more when I'm around next!",

My friend and I were told the bottom floor was meatballs, the second floor was pizza and other \"Italian plates\", and the rooftop bar was drafts, appetizers and bar food. We decided on the first  floor for meatballs.  Our waiter was knowledgable and friendly, as were the women sitting next to us (who were regulars). I ended up ordered \"saucy balls\" which came with 4 balls and a choice of sauce, and a salad. I had two chicken, one veggie and one beef with creamy Parmesan sauce. All the meatballs were incredible, and the sauce was so good I ate it alone with my fork. My friend also ordered the saucy balls with the \"arrabatta\" (??) sauce atop Parmesan fries.   I also ordered the \"salty dog\" cocktail, which was vodka, fresh (or fresh tasting) grapefruit juice and a salted rim with crushed ice. It was very good.  Overall great food, quick service, but a lot pricier than I anticipated. I would definitely check out the other floors if I'm in the city again.",

Friendly, attentive, and makes a great Bloody Mary.    The menu is simple and good for the soul.  The concept is simple- pick a meatball type (vegetarian options available too), pick a sauce, then the type of dish.  I've had a meatball as a slider and I've also had an Italian sausage ball on a dish of Mac and cheese.  None have disappointed.  There is also a fantastic poutine fries available that my friends have raved about.   I need to make it up the steps for the rooftop beer garden pronto.  I will be back for happy hour!",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Friday night with my wife and another couple for dinner.  Since we couldn't make reservations, my wife and I arrived right around 6 PM with the hopes that we would be able to a get a table at around 7 which is when the other couple was scheduled to meet us.  Thankfully the hostess was able to help us.  She took down my phone number and put us in the system for 7 while telling us that we could go upstairs to have a drink.  We did just that by walking down the stairs and then taking the elevator up to the rooftop beer garden.  At just before 7 I received a text message to my phone saying that my table was ready. Unfortunately the set up here is not that great if you are waiting for a table at Mezzo in the beer garden.  First you have to wait for the slow elevator to take you down from the roof and the kicker here is that it won't stop at the second floor even if you press the button.  So then you have to go down to the first floor in order to walk back up to the second floor even though there is clearly a place you could exit the elevator on the second floor.  Anyways, the inside of Mezzo is decorated pretty nicely.  It has some exposed brick walls with painted on graphics, a bar and seating for probably around 40 people or so.  We were sat in one of the corners of the restaurant at a booth with a view overlooking Penn Ave.  What was cool was that it looked like in warmer weather that the second floor windows could be opened up.  For dinner our table decided to start off the evening with the large Charcuturie platter as well as a large bread basket.  Both the charcuterie platter and the bread basket were brought out at the same time and each was explained by a different staff member.  The bread basket ended up having three pieces of three different kinds of breads and came with sides of a honey butter and a peppernota.  I can't remember all three types of breads but I do know that the cheese one (maybe a pecorino) was the best and that I also enjoyed the slightly spicy peppernota on it.  As for the charcuterie platter, WOW!  There were about 10 different kinds off meats as well as some crostinis, pickled onions and a cherry dipping sauce.  I don't think that there was a single thing on it that I didn't enjoy although my favorite meats were probably the Sopresetta and prosciutto.  I also really enjoyed the pickled onions and cherry sauce.  After we finally finished almost all of our appetizers our entrees came out.  My wife and I ordered the seafood risotto and also the tartufo pizza with the intention of sharing them with each other.  The seafood risotto was pretty good with many pieces of both octopus and squid in it as well as a few shrimp.  However, I still preferred the pizza and its mushrooms and cheeses.  There was an ever present smell of truffle on the pizza which was nice and the ricotta and fontina made a nice backdrop for it.  With the amount of food that we had consumed from the  appetizers we were not able to finish either entree and had about half of each to take home.  That didn't stop us from ordering dessert though and we ended up going with a blood orange custard like dessert where the custard was served frozen.  While I wasn't getting too much of the blood oranges flavors from it I did think that it tasted like a creamsicle and enjoyed both the taste and the interesting texture of it.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  I really enjoyed the charcuterie platter and all of the other food was good as well!",

    "text": "This review is for Mezzo, the wine and pizza bar contained within the same building as Sienna Mercato. Mezzo doesn't have it's own listing, so I had to post here!  We arrived here on a Saturday night around 6:30pm with no reservation, hoping we were early enough so that the wait wouldn't be too long. Luckily we were able to snag a very comfy seat at the bar and we're greeted promptly by an extremely friendly bartender who hooked us up with water and menus while still pumping out drinks to other patrons.   With some helpful input from our bartender, we decided on the mussels as a starter and the crispy skate wing dish, as well as the bacon and clam pizza. He timed things pretty wonderfully. My favorite fish was the mussels. I'm not the biggest fan of tomato sauce, but the sauce these huge mussels were floating in was rich and somewhat creamy and was pretty fantastic. They came with huge slices of grilled bread to sop up the sauce. My only complaint was that I didn't have more bread to enjoy the sauce with.   My SO enjoyed the pizza the best and I thought it was just okay. There was a bit too much of the clam flavor and not enough of the bacon flavor going on. We both liked the flavor of the skate, but I thought it a bit too acidic with the amount of capers that were in the dish. I'm glad I tried it--it was good--but I wouldn't order it again. NOT WITH ALL THOSE AMAZING MUSSELS TO BE HAD!  One of my favorite parts of the whole experience was the ambiance. The second floor looked like some cool converted loft and the lighting was nothing short of rom-com romantic. Overall I had a good experience and look forward to trying them again sometime.",

The open concept, strung lights and balcony overlooking Penn are perfect after dark. The crowd is exactly what I want - younger professionals and polite, even when the space is packed. And the bartenders are always friendly and gifted. I absolutely love it here.  You do have to take an elevator to the third floor, so that can be a bit of an annoyance - the stairs are only available for emergencies (and sneaking out for a cigarette). The second floor serves incredible food as well. We did my best friend's birthday here and it was amazing (although our server wasn't the best - but I won't hold it against this gem of a bar, just her.) - I haven't tried the first floor food, but my coworkers do lunch meetings there and I've heard great things.",

The idea of a restaurant focused on meatballs sounds a little dumb and I'm not sure the staying power that this restaurant will have. But, for now, I'm more than happy getting my fill of mushroom arincini while I can! The service itself has never been bad when I've gone and everything has been consistent.",

It's a little odd that you are limited in menu selections based on where you sit, and they do not take reservations, which is a bummer.  The meatballs and sides are absolutely delicious and it's worth the wait!   I would recommend going on a Sunday.  It's still full and fun but not as crowded and overwhelming.",

    "text": "My wife and I come to Emporio at least once a month.  We follow the same general ritual every time we come, so I'll give that a share.    Upon arriving, we order drinks at the bar or as soon as we are seated depending on the wait.  My wife has an alcohol allergy, so there are only a few beers that she can tolerate.  Rivertowne's Hala Kahiki is almost always on tap here, so that always makes her happy.    The past 4-5 times that we've been to Emporio, we start with the pickle chips which are incredibly delicious.  They are thin and lightly battered, so they aren't too overwhelming and don't make you feel like garbage afterwards.    For the entrees, we usually both get a pannini and split some good ole' government mac and cheese as a side.  I almost always go for the meatball of the month, where she usually keeps it basic with a beef meatball and marinarra sauce.    If you haven't been to the third floor for the open-air beer garden, make sure you do. It's one of our favorite places in the city.",

My one complaint was that our server was terrible! She only came to our table 3 times during that almost 2 hours we were there. We had to get up and go to the bar to get a refill on our water and we had to go find someone to bring us our check because she never came back. We actually watched her walk by at least three times and give us dirty looks instead of coming over to the table. We did speak to the manager and, during that time, the server walked by and gave us another dirty look instead of coming over to the table to see what the problem was. The manager said she would talk to her, but then as we were leaving, the server came over and made a snide remark to us about having talked to the manager.",

Everything is built around meatballs. They have 4 varieties and a daily special. You can order them as sliders, grinders etc. but I like the \"Four saucy balls\" for $10.00. You pick a sauce and can pair them with a salad, soup or one of many sides for about $5.00 more. My husband had the beef meatballs with brown mushroom gravy over tater tots and paired them with a salad which was quite large and very good. I had the special sausage meatballs with red sauce with onions and peppers and a side of mac n cheese. All were delicious. On the flip side....we waited way too long for a waitress to come over and even take our drink order. However once she arrived, service was great. She explained everything clearly and was very helpful. I would have enjoyed some bread but you don't get any. My \"saucy balls\" didn't have much sauce at all and when I asked for a little more, she charged me $2.00 for it.  No big deal. Certainly worth a trip before a show or anytime! Try the parmesan mac n cheese....oh my!",

    "text": "Sienna Mercato is a 3 story restaurant offering 3 unique dining experiences to locals & those visiting Pittsburgh. When you come, be prepared to make a decision as to what floor you would like to dine on. Below you will find a breakdown of the three levels at Sienna and what they have to offer.  1. Emporio: in Italian, the word emporio translates into \"general store\" - a local place where people can go to find what they are looking for fairly quickly. That is exactly what Emporio at Sienna is: a go-to, street level destination in the heart of Pittsburgh's thriving food scene. Emporio is a meatball joint - yep, meatballs. They serve four essential balls (beef, chicken, pork, and vegetarian) and feature a special meatball at the beginning of each month. This concept was new to Pittsburgh and still remains the only place in the Steel City where the specialty is meatballs. Emporio does well as a city restaurant because it is the type of place where you can walk in, no reservation needed, and spend less than $20 for an exciting and filling meal. When you order at Emporio, you choose everything, including the sauce that comes with your meatballs and the style that you would like it served to you (on a sandwich, over spaghetti, in soup, etc.) - the possibilities are endless. The vibe at Emporio is casual, fun, and trendy. There are several T.V screens around the restaurant featuring sporting events as well as bar seating with full service. You can walk in without a reservation and most likely be seated immediately. If you plan on coming during restaurant peak hours, especially on the weekends, it is a good idea to utilize the app \"NoWait\" and get in line for a table. If you do not have the app and prefer to not download it, you can simply call the restaurant and ask if they are on a wait yet. Emporio keeps customers coming back because there is always a new combination to try and it is a fun time for not a lot of money. The meatballs are tasty and the options are infinite!  2. Mezzo: Mezzo is the second story of Sienna. This restaurant offers a completely different dining experience than Emporio but, just as good. Mezzo's ambiance is quiet, cozy, and intimate. It's fine dining without the tablecloths and feels more like a family gathering than eating out at a restaurant. The menu at Mezzo is a chef-inspired Italian fair / farm to table concept, specializing in wood fire, Neapolitan style pizza as well as a charcuterie, cheese plates, and more. Mezzo is delightful. It's everything you want out of a trendy Italian spot in downtown. It is the type of environment that you take your parents out to, a first date, a bachelorette dinner, or just a solo bite and drink at the bar. Offering a quiet dining experience and one of the best wine selections in downtown Pittsburgh, Mezzo is True to Italian flavors and to Pittsburgh style at the same time. With seating overlooking bustling Penn Avenue, you will not be disappointed sharing pizza, sampling cheese, or sipping espresso at Mezzo. All ingredients used at Mezzo come from the Western Pennsylvania region, which makes it even more special. This level of Sienna takes reservations through \"Open Table\" or by phone. I recommend calling in to book a reservation, as they fill up quickly. Mezzo is one bite of goodness, wrapped up in porchetta, and sprinkled with parmesan. Again, it is delightful. 3. Il Tetto: in Italian, \"tetto\" translates to \"roof\" and that's exactly where you are when you go to Il Tetto. Offering apps and a huge selection of drinks this is the place where you want to start your evening, finish off your night or, both. Tetto is the longest rooftop bar in Pittsburgh. It features a retractable roof so that the fun doesn't stop even when it starts to rain. The bar is long but, there is also seating available on a first come first serve basis. This is a fun environment, with string lights, a nice view, and the volume increasing as the night goes on. The rooftop opens at 4pm every evening and stays open late, food being served until midnight. If you come on a weekend, expect to see a line to get up to the roof. It may be the longest bar in Pittsburgh but, due to its popularity, the rooftop does reach maximum capacity pretty easily.   Sienna Mercato is all about giving people options. It's like this guy and his wife had three great ideas and decided to stack them all on top of one another...and, it worked. Sienna creates an experience that you can pick and choose from. Engulf yourself in one floor, or try a little bit of each. Regardless, Sienna Mercato will keep you coming back and waiting in line for a new experience every time. It's good, times 3. Enjoy!  - xoxo, A  (a California girl living in Pittsburgh on purpose)",

    "text": "Always one of my favorite places to go when I'm down town. I stumbled in last year after leaving comic-con, and the staff was very accepting and friendly of everyone who came by (cosplayers included). The restaurant has a very laid back and trendy vibe, making it a perfect place to stop in with your family or a few friends at any time. The most interesting part of going is that their restaurant is broken into three tiers; Emporio (a meatball joint), Mezzo (for wine & pizza), and Il Tetto (a rooftop beer garden and cocktail bar).  Coming from a large Italian family, I'm always skeptical of getting meatballs whenever I go out. That being said, Emporio's meatball and sauce selection felt like a homage to many of the traditional recipes I grew up on.They have a choice of 4 different types of meatballs and 10 different sauces (including vegetarian and gluten free options for both categories). I always order the \"saucy balls\" which comes with 4 (fairly large) meatballs with a choice of sauce. They also have a fantastic poutine, which I would highly recommend.   I have not been able to visit Mezzo yet, but I have been to Il Tetto several times. The beer selection is impressive, boasting 32 drafts that get rotated periodically. The cocktail list is not huge, but I have found that they can make pretty much any classic that you ask of them. The cocktails always seem to be slightly heavy handed, but nothing unbearable. You can also order bar snacks, pizza, and desserts if you want something to eat or snack on while you hang out.  Overall, I would would highly recommend stopping in if you need somewhere fun and relaxed to stop for lunch and dinner. It's also a great place to take people visiting from out of town, as it is not to fancy and have a good selection for all tastes. The only gripe I have is that it is pricier than I would have thought.",

The food is great, I never knew there were so many ways to modify a meatball - sauce, cheese, on appetizers, on salads and everything else!!   You have to check out their meatball of the month. They had one back in March that was corned beef with sauerkraut! You don't have to wait long for the food and the service at the bar has always been very good.  They have 32 cold beers on tap and are always changing the lineup, never a bad thing!",

If you have the opportunity, take it from me -- you need to go!  The crowd can get unreal -- shoulder-to-shoulder people mingling, picking up, laughing, chatting -- and this extends tot he bar, of course. If you see your opening, take it and don't give it up until you've got what you want. A word to the wise: be polite. These 'tenders won't be messed around with, and they'll ignore you if they want to.   While there are oodles of long tables and a few high tops, the real fun is out on the balcony where you can take int he city streets, the night life happening in the bar and the beautiful lights above. Just don't place your drinks on the railing -- there's a guy whose sole purpose is to tell you not to!",

I wasn't feeling like pizza, so I ordered the small Italian cheese plate and the small bread basket (wait... isn't that basically deconstructed pizza...). Cheese plate was good with some interesting selections, but nothing too crazy or different. Came with spiced candied nuts and raisin chutney, which were both tasty and smart pairings for the cheese. Bread was amazing and came with deliciously smooth and salty butter. For the small size I thought the quantity was generous and the price fair. Two or three people could easily share either one as an appetizer or small plate.  Overall great experience and really no complaints!",

Wondering what the hell was going on because there were at least 2 people working the bar area and it wasn't very crowded.  Ignore, ignore, ignore, person sitting one seat away has order taken and that was where I couldn't take it anymore.

    "text": "For as much hype that I had heard about Emporio, I was a little disappointed in my first visit.  Pros: - the food is excellent!  sauces tasty, meatballs flavorful and moist, sides surprising and delicious.  - atmosphere is trendy and inviting.    - our server was friendly, helpful, and on her game.  reading some of the other reviews citing poor service - today was much better than   Cons: - i was disappointed by the size of the lunch entree.  i ordered the panini, with 2 meatballs.  it's literally half a sandwich, cut on a diagonal.  the meatballs are bigger than a golf ball, but not by much.  i think i was expecting Buca di Beppo size meatballs, because it's a meatball restaurant.  or at least a whole sandwich.  the dish of sauce that accompanies the meatballs was delicious, and there was enough to dip the sandwich in.    - maybe I'm too old, but i felt that it was too dark in the booth that we were seated in.  - some of the waitstaff wore tshirts with the restaurant name on hem, but many others just seemed to wear whatever they wanted. I wasn't sure who was working there vs. not.    - though i liked the atmosphere, it's very similar to tenpenny, right around the corner.  i'm giving this three stars, mostly due to the portion size of the panini being much smaller than I expected.",

    "text": "My favorite bar in Pittsburgh, especially in the summer. Honestly the drinks are good (not great) and it can be somewhat miserable trying not to get to the roof because the elevator moves so slowly and there is often a long line, but the roof is just so awesome. It's a big area and very beautiful. Best bar atmosphere in Pittsburgh! Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Mezzo for the longest time and finally decided to do so Saturday night. My best friend and I didn't even mind having to wait 45 minutes for a table because our waitress was extremely nice and the ambiance of the restaurant was so fun and exciting. Even though it was loud, it was fine. First, our water came out warm; but we didn't complain. We were so excited to get poutine since we haven't had any from Canada in almost a year. Once it came out were were extremely disappointed. The fries were covered in mozzarella cheese, not cheese curds, and the chicken gravy was chalky as if it was powered. My pesto spaghetti portion was extremely small for the price. I don't think I'll be returning, unfortunately.",
