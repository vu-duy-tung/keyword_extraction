    "text": "I have definitely had better!  A friend of mine decided to have her birthday dinner here. Ugh! Horrible experience. The staff was not friendly and was in such a rush. The Chef was nice but didn't talk to us much. He just joked a little and then was determined to finish cooking our meals. Probably rush to cook another table or go smoke, who knows! Our drinks were low during dinner, honestly we weren't sure where our server was?!   I am not impressed with the amount of money you spend on these meals for the amount of food you get. The soup broth was kind of watered down, but the salad is always good. For the dinner portion, tiny shrimp, few pieces of chicken, steak, and way too salty fried rice. (This is where I needed my drink )   This is definitely a chain restaurant as I noticed that they have other locations. I had heard before coming here that it was Chinese owned. Just like the Saga restaurants are. The Chinese are taking over!!   Overall, we all felt rushed and the service sucked. It's an in and out thing. Quickly serve, cook, pay, and get up so we can sit more people. Sure the inside decor is nice, but the food quality is not up to par! The birthday girl wasn't too happy but we made up for it later.",

    "text": "Customer satisfaction? Ichiban Hibachi Steakhouse Robinson gets a 1 because there ain't no zero's. I wanted to celebrate a milestone birthday for my wife at Ichiban Robinson  thinking the table side chef would be fun.  We are a small family so I stopped a week in advance to ask about their birthday package and to make sure 6-8 adults would be acceptable for a private table. No problem! Cake, photo, candle and music included in package! Told me reservations every half hour and if early would seat in advance as long as we understood chef is on schedule. Perfect!   Here's what we got: Large room with many Hibachi's mostly empty, except our table which already was occupied. I said to hostess,  \"this is a reserved birthday party, for a private table, what's going on?\" She looked at me as if I'm nuts and says \"You don't have enough people for party, you only have 6\" I said, \"but, but....\" to her back as she turned and just walked off. I didn't want a scene, but our group is scattered to the four winds, just together for this occasion.  I didn't really want \"party crashers\" especially this party, ergo my reservation and package purchase.   Not wanting to start my wife's birthday with a scene, I followed our hostess back to the lobby and found I was talking to a stone wall. This lady could care less. No management solution here in the inn regardless of what they promised a week ago.  Normally we love meeting strangers and dining with them,  and dealing with their kids, but this was a special occasion planned for in advance. We had gifts and wanted to talk old times and wanted to honor my wife getting, eh, really old!  Back at the table, as I looked around the otherwise empty room, the hostess now sat a party of 6 who remained a party of 6 all evening. That started my blood boiling and provided motivation for this review.   The \"birthday cake\" package I purchased turned out to be two scoops of ice cream with a tilted candle in a small cup given to our \"honored guest\" after first  giving complimentary ice cream to the \"strangers\" children. No cake.  The chef was entertaining with the spatulas and did his job, but all he said was, \"We have a birthday here?\" Nothing else and certainly made no attempt at acknowledgment, or serving her first or anything to prioritize. I don't think he got the memo on party etiquette!   Trust me, we are easy people to please. Too easy. Do not book and pay for a private party package at Ichiban Robinson. That will not get you deference or consideration of any kind. BTW, the gratuity was built into the bill, but I doubled it not wanting to punish the chef and wait staff for management misrepresentations. DO NOT GO HERE FOR ANY PRIVATE PARTY OF ANY KIND.",

The waitress was awful though, she took forever to bring our drinks (wine, beer, a water and two kids juices, nothing fancy) and then we never saw her again until she was helping the attached  table and I flagged her down to get seconds, but by the time they arrived we were nearly done and ended up sucking it down at the last minute. The chef was \"meh\", we have been to quite a few of these kinds of restaurants and this was a bit of a disappointment comparatively. Most of the food was (except the steaks) cooked to the max or over cooked. Not what I expect for this amount of money!  One bright spot was the sushi we got. My 5 year old likes to get some so I went with a rookie version of sushi with the tempura shrimp roll and it was really great!! We both LOVED it!  Oh and GPS cannot find the place either! We tried the TomTom and my phone and we finally just turned in to a strip mall and then we finally found it. What a pain.",

    "text": "Terrible customer service, mediocre food. I can't access any of my money thanks to these inconsiderate people. I ordered takeout for lunch and went to the restaurant to pick it up. As the hostess handed back my debit card after paying, she noticed that she had charged me the wrong amount and went to get the manager. I honestly assumed she had just made a small error, and being a hostess at a restaurant myself, I didn't make a big deal of it. Then I was informed that I was charged $112 for my $12 order, and the manager an hostess both nonchalantly assured me that the money would be restored to my card in 24 hours. I am absolutely incensed right now. I am a hostess at a restaurant and I'm a student. I live paycheck to paycheck and $12 for lunch was actually a pretty big splurge for me. $112 is more money than I even have on my card. Considering her mistake was a $100 difference, you would think that the hostess - and the manager for that matter - would be at the very least somewhat apologetic, but they treated it so casually. If I get charged an overdraft fee, they will be paying for it. Thank god I have gas in my tank because they literally took my entire paycheck. The staff of this restaurant visibly didn't care that they were screwing me over, and the food wasn't anything impressive. I will not be back.",

    "text": "Awful experience. I sat at the sushi bar, the bartender (dirty blonde hair) insulted me immediately to start. I ordered a spicy Combo that comes with soup an salad. She just sat at the end of the bar and never brought them. I asked her if I was supposed to get them and she said nobody has ever ordered that.  She told me she's been there for a year and a half, there are like 4 things on the happy hour menu.  She says \"your sushi is almost done, do you even want soup/salad now?\". I said no to avoid having to speak to 'it' anymore.  She was the most vile thing that's crossed my path in over a decade.  Sushi was wet and tasteless. She never even offered to lower the price for her neglect.    I actually shared this story with a bunch of people at the conference I was at as an example of how NOT to treat others, especially customers.    Never again!",

They did have a good happy hour though, both drinks and appetizers. Calamari and Rangoons were really good! Then went to hibachi table for dinner and server was fine but the chef was hardly entertaining. He looked like he hated his job. At least the food made the experience totally worth it!! Delicious!",

    "text": "I was here on 7/11 for Dinner with my Boyfriend and my niece. I contacted the restaurant first and got no response, so I am leaving this review. I use to come to this restaurant 2-3 times a month...I can say it is more like twice a year now, and This will be my last time here. We came because my niece wanted to go there. Let me tell you how horrible it was. The Chef was not entertaining, to me that is all part of the \"show\" to say. He was not fun at all. The waitress was so miserable and seemed to hate her life...she took our order and came back with the salads and soup. The chef came out and was starting to cook and there was another waitress behind him taking orders at the other table, our waitress somehow squeezed in between them and asked for everyone to pass their bowls down through us to hand to her instead of walking around the table like any other person would of done. She refilled drinks the same way passed everything through my boyfriend, to me, to my neice and so on down the table. We were not a big group of people, we did not know the other family sitting with us. While all of this was going on she coughed a few times right over the food cart, pretty gross and unappetizing right? I told myself there is no food right on top and there was a sandwich of people so hopefully the germs never made it to the food. I was very annoyed when it was all said and done I ate a few peices of my filet but really could not bring myself to eat. I asked for a to go box...figured at least my dog would get some filet mignon out of this.  When I received the check I paid and I did not tip because to me this is extremly poor service. I waited till my niece was done with her drink, we got up and started to leave. The waitress came running into the parking lot telling me I forgot to leave her tip. I told her I did not forget, the service was horrible and I did not think anyone deserved a tip.  Not to mention, last time I checked it is my option to leave a tip. You do the job you are supposed to and not be lazy than absolutely I have no issue leaving you a 20% tip. I can assure you I will not be back I will drive to Washington to Fusion.",

Twice we've come in with large to very large parties and twice they were able to sit us within 10 minutes of our entire parties being present.  The first time it was 10 and the second time we had 14 people.  It is True that the Chef can make or break the experience as far as entertainment is concerned, but at the same time the food is so darn good I just want to be served and be left to EAAAAAT.  This time around I shared Chicken & Steak and it was both cooked perfectly to a tender and juicy medium while the seasoning made the meats POP.  The rice, noodles, and vegetables were all well made with the right amount of soy sauce, spices, and served piping hot.  The servers were super nice, a tad slow a times, but that's understandable if I'd been working all night long and then had a group of 14 people come in after 9pm I'd be a tad overwhelmed, haha.  I can't wait to go back!!",

The server taking our food was in a rush for us to order. I said we needed a minute. Two minutes later she came back and said \"ready now\" with an attitude. We were easy to order but it was the way she spoke to us. We didn't feel very welcomed. A minute later she dropped off outlets salads and soups and disappeared. Through out the meal other serves we're filling our water glasses. When the table was finished the other to groups got their checks right away as we waited. And when we did get our check it was incorrect and when we told her she just took it and walked away. At that point I said to my mother in law \"wow her attitude sucks\". My mother in law paid the check, as we were walking to my car the server followed us out and asked about her tip. That she served us and where was her tip. My mother in law said no that's right. And the server yelled at us not to come back so she doesn't have to serve us. I'm in complete shock",

Was not crowded but they always make you wait, not matter if early, late or on time.    2. Depending on chef it can be a blast or OK.  Chef tonight was not very good or entertaining.  In the past usually very good.  3. Servers can be slow or fast.  Server was rushing everything, must have been in a hurry to leave.  Also, he had a hard time understanding everyone.  In the past, servers were good but usually slow and if you wanted a drink refill, forget about it for about 20 minutes.    4.  Food can be real good or oh so average.  In the past was surprised how good it was.  This time, shrimp overcooked and did not seem fresh, how long was it in the freezer?  5. Steak, better hope everyone wants it cooked the same method, especially since they slice it up, usually get it med well since that is the way someone orders it even though asked for medium rare.  We still had fun.  But why are they so inconsistent.  Visit before this one was much better.",

The decor is a little aged but it fits in nicely when they drop the disco ball lights and hit the music for the in-house birthday celebrations...  This was a little on the wacky side but still gets a chuckle or two out of me.  Yeah, you need to see it to believe it.  The food was terrific!  The steamed edamame are now a go to of mine as a hibachi appetizer, many thanks to my experience at Ichiban.  But what really resonates with me still to this day was the fried rice!  A nice hearty supply of rice with fried egg that really packs a punch.  Next time I may skip the veggies and go double rice.  This place had some decent traffic on a weekday evening as well.  Tucked a way in a retail strip center this bodes well as a sign of approval from the locals.  Service was decent and the chef was friendly and put on a good show.  The waiter, although not for a lack if effort, struggled to keep up with the water refills.   In addition to the water, they also serve my favorite Japanese beer, Kirin Ichiban!  Ichiban means \"number one\" in Japanese and very fitting to end my review of Ichiban on that note.",

    "text": "My husband and I was invited to my goddaughter's 21st birthday dinner here last night February 24, 2017. It was the second worst experience in my 36 years at a restaurant. We sat at the bar with the birthday girl's dad since she or her other guests hasn't arrive yet. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri it was not good. It tasted nothing like a good strawberry daiquiri I had at other places like TGI Friday's, Red Lobsters, or my own. There was a confrontation with one of the hostess and my goddaughter (was not present for that interaction), but the hostess kept walking pass giving my gd a dirty look. We were seated and the first thing I noticed was the waiter was sitting the menu in each plate. That's so nasty there's so many germs on those menus and you would sit one in a plate were the food going to go. I already knew I was asking for another plate. The table was not wiped off well leftover sauce and hard noodles in the crack. The waiter came over to take our ordered that was horrible my husband tried to order by the number and the waiter did not know which meal it was, so my husband had to tell him. The soup and salad was served after 15 minutes of being seated (it was an average crowd) my soup had nothing but liquid no mushrooms or onions the salad was okay. We had to move so they could have two chefs (there was 11 of us). The first chef already started, the second one started 5 minutes later. We always wait until all the food is done to pour our sauces on and eat. The chef was not entertaining and too slow cooking the food, so by the time I went to eat my rice and noodles it was lukewarm/cold, but I was so hungry I just start eating. It was just ok it was not a lot of food. I had the shrimp and scallops, but it was about 6 shrimps and 6 scallops a handful of rice and noodles. Our bill was $76 and some change not worth it for the amount of food and service 18% was already on the check because we was in a party of more than 6. Maybe their reason for lack of service. I went to the ladies room before leaving it smelled like pee and toilet paper was all over the floor a very nasty bathroom. On our way out saying bye to the birthday girl dad the hostess that had the confrontation with my gd and the other two hostess was upfront at their podium. I observed the one just staring at us all crazy as we were saying our goodbyes, so I asked her was everything ok she did not say a word she just nodded her head yes and asked are you sure she nodded yes (just strange and weird). I was so over it that I went back in and asked for the manager. Speaking with him about his staff was like talking to a brick wall. I've been a manager no way would an employee of mines would have a confrontation with a paying customer and still be standing there. It was no use in speaking to the manager. It was my first and last time at that location. If I find out the one in Waterworks is owned by the same in Robinson I will never go to that one again as well. I went to the Waterworks location 4 times and always a great experience. I will make sure to tell family and friends to never eat at the Robinson location. She should had it at Saga like her dad wanted to do! SN: As we were still eating they came over with to go containers,no way of knowing if we were finish eating. I felt rushed, Iike they wanted us to go and they did not sing happy birthday as well.",

The hibachi filet comes with both fried rice and noodles. Both are really good and flavorful. Plus the Peters Twp location is immaculate and beautifully done. I will try all Ichiban's around the city any time I am near.  Dionne Malush, Pittsburgh Realto",

I ordered the steak and chicken combo and it was really yummy. Nothing was overlooked. He kept the yum yum sauce refills coming! It was nice not having to ask.",

We shared three rolls: Volcano, OMG, and Las Vegas. As another reviewer said, the volcano roll is tasty but heavy on the sauce. However, it (and everything we ordered) was exactly as described on the menu. If you're not into a lot of sauce, read the menu carefully as the volcano roll has three different sauces! Overall we were impressed with the service, selection, presentation, and taste of our food. We would not hesitate to have sushi here in the future.",

Sushi is always prepared with quality ingredients, but the preparation is different in different days depending who's slicing the fish. One chef has fantastic knife skills and works magic with the fish by slicing very thin and consistent making the fish melt in your mouth. If this chef were the only one slicing the fish I would probably give them 5 stars, but the other guys are a bit ham fisted and leave the fish a lot thicker and over sauce the plates too. Overall it's a very good place and I head there more often than my check ins show. So swing by, pay Cliff a visit, a have a a New York grill appetizer with the yellow tail...you'll be glad you did.",

    "text": "I dined here on Friday August 5th with three colleges.   I thought this was a strange place to be located in a strip mall. After reading some of the reviews I was hesitant - but wanted a good lunch before my flight (a business partner raved about their sushi roll lunch specials) I don't eat sushi but was assured I would find something I enjoyed.   Upon entering they were rather busy for 1 PM , my friend said they close after lunch which I found odd. There were two girls working. One stated it would be about a 10-15 minute wait. The other recognized my partner & was very friendly with her, she said she would get us in once I expressed concern on missing my flight. She took us back almost immediately. This place is H U G E. Several cooking tables going and a large dining room. The room was very busy. We were brought waters quickly and asked if we needed some time before ordering. I ordered a hibachi chicken with rice. It was good, I liked the different dipping sauces it came with and the dressing on the salad was fantastic. My check came & I believe it was $10!! For all of that food, I realized why it was so busy. Despite how busy everyone seemed we got in and out in less than hour. When we left my friend joked with the host that she would see her in a few days. I will definitely return to Ichiban if I am in Pittsburgh again.   My experience was almost the opposite of most reviews on here. * Excellent food and service from all employees I encountered and I didn't feel rushed at all. Even though it was lunch hour.   Give them a try.",

What's good: Angry Dragon Roll Monster Roll OMG Roll Volcano Roll Gyoza Soup  What's \"just ok\": Service (based on a single visit) Decor/atmosphere Noise level  They also do something REALLY cheesy for birthdays, complete with disco lights and crazy song.

FOOD:  We started with sushi - the Volcano roll which is a deep fried tuna, crabmeat, and cucumber rolled and then deep fried with a couple different sauces(server's recommendation).  The whole sushi is hot in temp. and a bit spicy from the sauces, but a great combination!  We had the Yaki Udon shrimp which is thick noodles sauteed with shrimp and vegetables.  Yummy!  And the Seasoned Vegetable which is an assortment of vegetables sauteed in brown sauce served with rice.  Another good dish!  Overall, the food was good and I'll definitely come back!",

Pretty empty around 11am, though it had definitely filled up by the time we left about an hour and a half later.  Not a super impressive hibachi presentation or anything, but the food was decent enough for an office occasion.  The CLEAR SOUP had full flavor, though it was pathetically accented with about 4 shavings of the thinnest mushroom slices I have ever seen, as if they had been turned out with a truffle shaver.  The SALAD was a crisp, fresh pile of iceberg with a few wisps of carrot, and my HIBACHI VEGETABLES were coated with a perfectly palatable sweet teriyaki sauce that tasted very much of the thick slab of butter I watched the cook fry them in.    Simple, super-Americanized hibachi.  What you see is what you get, literally.  I'm sure I'll be back, and I'm not mad about it.",

I got the chicken & shrimp hibachi meal which is served with fried rice & lo mein.....DELICIOUS!! Everything was cooked just right.  You also get a small soup & salad included. I went there for my birthday, so I indulged & enjoyed an Ichiban Ice Tea cocktail. It was kind of like a Long Island Ice Tea but it had Saki in it instead of tequila....I enjoyed it a lot!  So to sum up..great food, with the addition of the entertainment of the hibachi chef & wonderful atmosphere, I highly recommend.",

He gave my boyfriend's drink to a stranger across the table who gave it back. It looked like he was about to offer the drink to my boyfriend then, when he spoke up and said just bring me another one. He waited over 10 minutes for his new drink. The chef was already at our table before he actually got his drink!!  The food was okay. Not particularly full of flavor like other hibachi grills I've visited, but not bland either. I got the chicken and steak dinner, I thought both meats were kind of chewy, which I didn't like.  We also got the Volcano Roll sushi. It was amazing. I must say the sushi is on point!!",

I have tried many rolls on their menu, but my favorite and now my standard is the Fresh Green Roll (cucumber, asparagus, and avocado) and the Friends Roll (shrimp tempura and avocado, topped with spicy crab).  However, I get my friends Roll made a little healthier without tempura.  My mouth is giddy just thinking about it.  I have never been here for anything other than lunch special sushi takeout.   I've been to the Wexford location for the same sushi and it was not nearly as good as the Robinson spot.  1/12 - went again today. The ginger dressing was amazing today. The fresh green roll was perfect. I also tried the sweet potato roll, which I felt could have used more sweet potato.  I've been mother places that make it pretty decent and use minimal rice, whereas this one was more rice, less yam. Still, I liked it, but probably wouldn't get it again.  8/15/16 Update...My new addiction here is the green phoenix appetizer with a seaweed salad. Hear me now, thank me later. Mouthgasm!!!",

Instead of getting the hibachi meal, since I didnt care for it last time, I decided to get a simple appetizer.  I got the Yakitori (Tender Chicken Skewers served with Teriyaki sauce).  For $5 I thought I would be bigger and better. just small pieces of onion and pepper. The chicken pieces was also very small. Then on top of that the chicken was over cook as it was dry and chewy. Also didnt have any seasoning on it. Also you can tell they just cook the chicken and then added the teriyaki sauce.. which of course just ran off the chicken and onto the plate. I would think they would baste or marinade the chicken in teriyaki. The sauce it self was very sweet and had a hint of teriyaki.   In short t wasnt terrible but I wouldnt order it again.",

Our waitress was very nice & pleasant, stopping by several times to refill our beverages while we waited for the 2 'late-comers' to arrive.  Co-worker 1 ordered Spring Rolls and they came out quickly.  The outside pastry was thin & crispy, cooked in the right temperature oil so as to not absorb any of it.    I had the 'Pick 2' rolls ($12.95) and I chose the Eel Cucumber Roll and the Godzilla Roll.  The eel cucumber was stuffed with probably the largest piece of eel I have ever had in a roll and the surrounding rice was slightly warm with a delicious eel sauce drizzled on top.  This was VERY GOOD.  My Godzilla roll was filled with tuna, salmon, white fish & crabmeat lightly deep fried with tobiko & green onion on top with eel & hot sauces drizzled on top.  This one was EXCEPTIONAL...!      For his entree, Co-worker 1 ordered Yaki Udon ($10) with chicken and it came out rather bland looking.  He enjoyed it but I don't think I would ever order it after seeing it.  Co-worker 2 also ordered the 'Pick 2' ($12.95) and she picked a Tuna Roll and a Sexy Kimberly Roll.  The tuna roll looked stuffed with tuna and she said it was delicious but the Sexy Kimberly came out looking like the star of the show.  It had spicy tuna & avocado inside, salmon on top with hot sauce & tempura sprinkles on top.  She devoured that in about a minute.    My boss ordered 'Spicy Tasted' ($10) with shrimp, which was stir fried vegetables, shrimp of course, and a spicy hot sauce that looked delicious.    All of our lunches came with soup or a salad and the 'non-sushi' ones also came with white rice.      I will definitely be going back there...",

The kitchen prepared a dinner order instead of the lunch order.  The meal was very good with a good balance of shrimp and vegetables with my thick udon noodles.    The meal sent me in to a carbohydrate coma for the afternoon.  I split an Angry Dragon Roll with my grouop.    One of the better sushi combinations I have had.  Second Trip:     Sushi Night -    I order the Angry Dragon Roll, Spicey Sear Ahi Tuna, and Yellow Tail and Jalepeno (in a Cilantro sauce).    All were very delicate and yummy.  Service -   I have always sat at the bar.   The bartenders both times were engaging when we initiated conversation.     They provided great detail on the sushi orders and good advice.  Price:   Lunch will run you around $12 for Udon Noodles, Sushi is priced anywhere from $9 to $14 per roll / plate.    Overall a good experience.  Atmosphere - This is the ding on the place.   This is a birthday to go place for kids.   They do a lot of things to celebrate birthdays with sparklers and disco lights.   You cannot avoid the spectacle even if you are sitting at the bar.    The second night I went to the restaurant - the disco light show was on so much that I felt I was at a night club (but all the lights were on - so ...  It was just a lot of noise).  All and all - I will be back for lunch to avoid the night time spectacle for sushi!",

Very very very rude hostesses every single time! Plus, the waiters don't really listen to what you order half the time. Most chefs are nice, however one time I had a chef named Tom who not only got my order wrong, but yelled at me and told me I didn't actually order what I wanted. I hate going back and getting Tom as a chef, but the food is so yummy!",

Unfortunately, considering all aspects, I am giving a 1-star review due to one receptionist's incredibly rude attitude. We went for dinner on Thursday, May 28. There were two receptionists when we went. One was very nice, and greeted us as we came and left. The other did not, and more. Right when we walked into the restaurant, she asked us \"how many?\" and \"hibachi or dining?\" in a clipped, I-don't-care-and-have-no-time tone when she wasn't busy.   Next, after we were seated, she came back with more customers and demanded that we move one seat over to squeeze everyone in one table. I completely understand moving over to fit everyone - it wasn't our first time eating at hibachi and it happens. But, she basically told us \"you need to move right now!\"  In summary, this particular receptionist's overall poor and mean attitude towards customers is not acceptable for someone working at restaurant where she has frequent interaction with everyone. From body language to speaking tones, she did not act in a professional manner.",

    "text": "I went here for lunch recently after I had been craving hibachi for some time.  The atmosphere and service was pretty standard for a hibachi joint.  We started off with salad and soup.  The salad was one of the better ones I have had at a hibachi place.  Specifically, the dressing really stood out and had a great flavor.  The soup was pretty average.  For my meal I went with filet and scallops.  They give you both rice and noodles as sides which I thought would be great.  The rice was really good and I could have eaten a lot more.  The noodles however were doused in teriyaki sauce which made them overly slimy and not appetizing.  The overuse of teriyaki sauce was a theme throughout the rest of the food being cooked.  Almost everything, including the meats were slathered in a thick teriyaki sauce.  This caused everything to taste the same and created a pretty gross texture of the food.  My scallops were decent.  My steak was pretty good, however it was over cooked for medium rare.  With so many good hibachi places around, I would probably avoid this one.",

I have been to several other ichiban locations as well, and they are all pretty much the same. The food is your typical hibachi restaurant. Sushi is pretty decent but nothing special. They are accommodating to large groups, which is always a plus. I'd say ichiban could use a good cleaning though. The floors always seem dirty and the restaurant itself is very dark. More lighting would be nice. The best thing about ichiban is their lunch specials. You can get a ton of food for a really low price. I can never finish my meal and always have to take it home. Although ichiban isn't my favorite sushi/hibachi place, I'm sure I'll be back as it is rather convenient.",

    "text": "A colleague and I came here for dinner on a Monday night around 5:45 pm. It wasn't terribly busy; there was one hibachi table that was filled with cooking underway, and we were seated at the adjacent hibachi table, where 2 other diners were waiting. Shortly afterwards, 3 other people joined and the waitress came around to take orders. My coworker and I both ordered the steak and shrimp mixed hibachi, which was only $1 more than steak alone.  We started with soups and salads while the chef came around a few minutes later and verbally confirmed orders. He was friendly and looked very skilled. The rice and noodles were cooked first, followed by veggies and meat. The portions were pretty huge. The chef took into account cooking preferences; other than asking how we wanted our steak, he was also obliging when one of the diners asked for her noodles and chicken to be cooked longer. The food was really flavorful; I found I didn't use much of my dipping sauces since the food was cooked with enough sauces for me.   The restaurant was reasonably clean, as were the ladies' rooms. The staff were all very efficient with orders, busing tables, and checks. You could order food from the kitchen even if you were eating at the hibachi table. The restaurant was pretty big, with several tables and a good amount of seating.  Our meal came out to just under $50 (before tip but after tax). We didn't order desserts or drinks but the amount of food from the hibachi grill was generous. Amex accepted. Overall, a nice place to treat yourself to a fun and filling dinner, if you're willing to spend a bit more than at other restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came to Ichiban for lunch on a Wednesday and had a great Hibachi meal.  We absolutely love Hibachi and have tried just about every Japanese Steakhouse in Pittsburgh, but Ichiban might just take the cake for the best Japanese Steakhouse in Pittsburgh.   We arrived to Ichiban for a late lunch at about 2 PM, hoping that we could still get Hibachi, considering their lunch stopped at 2:30 PM. As soon as we walked in the Hostess asked us if we'd like sit-down or Hibachi; after we said that we wanted Hibachi she communicated to the other Hostess that we would be the last Hibachi lunch. So try to get there before 2 PM for lunch! It's worth it.  We were guided into the dining area which was a full house! At 2 PM on a Tuesday! That was a good sign. We were seated at the only available table w/ 4 other guests and ordered immediately.   We both ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Hibachi lunch which was $16.95. The lunch portion is served w/ soup, salad, rice, vegetables and noodles! The Chef came out right away and cooked our entire meal in less than 30 mins. We were eating by 2:30 PM. Lunch is less of a show, so not as many tricks as dinner, the Chef just got straight to business.   The food was great. The shrimp were large and filling. In comparison to other Hibachi restaurants in the area, I think that Sapporo's Special chicken has more flavor than Ichiban's chicken but everything else was much better. Ichiban's sauces tasted great on the noodles and rice.  Our waiter, Vivian, made sure that we had everything we needed and provided us excellent customer service. We finished eating our meals around 3 PM and even as the restaurant was closing she didn't make us feel rushed at all.   We will definitely come back to Ichiban the next time we are craving Hibachi. Judging by how busy their lunch is, we'll probably make a reservation for dinner.",

We were not disappointed! Based on the outside look of the this place, I would have never guessed it was as large of a restaurant as it was. There was a bar seated area, sushi bar seated area, middle of the road seated area , and hibachi grill area! So many table and was getting busy. We sat in the dining area but I absolutely hate middle of the room seating so asked to move. Hiding in a booth is our desired location ! We strictly came for sushi and drinks so I cannot comment on the hibachi. However, good sushi is hard to find and the specialty rolls were really done well. We had the ichiban and monster roll and they were awesome. We also ordered a sashimi and sushi entree and that's mainly why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. Some of the sashimi was  maybe not super fresh as it could be but not horrible either. The silky smooth and melt your mouth deliciousness of sashimi every bite was lacking. On a good note, my Appletinj martini was prepared on point and they had a nice cocktail selection.How we feel about our experience at restaurants is 50/50 when it comes to food and customer service. Our server Chris was very helpful and attentive. We will certainly be returning to Ichiban again.",

    "text": "A very close friend of mine took me here for dinner on a Saturday night, it wasn't crowded at all and we were seated right away at a hibachi table.  Our waiter was very polite, he went over the menu with us since it was our first time here.  We had to wait for other people to be seated at our hibachi table before the show could be started.  We ordered the steak and shrimp and vegetables with a side of rice and noodles.  With your meal you get a soup and salad.  Everything was delivered to our table promptly and was nice and hot.  Finally our chef came to our table and did a show on the hibachi, he was very nice, professional and did a great job. Once our food was finished and we started eating me and my friend both agreed that our food could have been seasoned better it was lacking some seasoning and the steak was a little tough for a medium well steak.  All and all the staff was great, but the food was lacking, I actually didn't finish all of my food and just took the rest home.  I have been to Sakura in Monaca, PA and I love their food so I think I will just continue to go there.",

    "text": "I'm really confused by all of the negative reviews because I've never had a terrible experience here! I've been going for probably as long as the place has been open. From my elementary/middle school years to now when I'm 20 years old. The hibachi chefs are fun and interactive. The waiters/waitresses are nice and usually quick with refills. I've had several of my own birthdays here as well as other family member's birthdays here and they've always brought out ice cream and turned that crazy music on. I usually get the fried rice and shrimp and chicken hibachi meal. Sometimes the chicken is a little dry but the shrimp is always good. When you get the chicken meal by itself they still give you about two shrimps. The shrimp sauce is SO good and I pour it all over my rice and meat. I don't like the vegetables too much (the rest of my family does though) so I ask for no veggies and they give me extra rice. The soup and salad are excellent. The bathrooms are clean. The dining space is clean. I recommend going during lunch hour and sitting in the bar area at a table, you get your food much faster because you don't have to wait on a hibachi chef. The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because my mother and I have to use the bathroom nearly immediately after eating here every single time. I've never thrown up so I wouldn't say it's food poisoning and it could just be us but it's just something to be careful of!",

    "text": "The sushi here has the most variety and seems to be the freshest out of all of the Ichiban locations.  I would say to not go here for the teppanyaki as portions can vary, but it's not bad quality either, maybe it's just not my thing.   I find that the board has something different every time I come here, which is awesome! I enjoy trying the new specials they have. The other locations keep their specials up for about a year or so, which gets old after awhile.  The tuna here is the best in the city, especially the way that they prepare spicy tuna, it is godlike.   Above all, the prices for special rolls here are comparable to the waterworks location, and aren't ridiculous like the wexford one. Taking a star off only because sometimes the rolls end up being kinda small, but that might be just me.",

They do give you very big portions.  My wife actually got sick later that evening.  Needless to say we will not be going back there any time soon.",

    "text": "I've always enjoyed Ichiban. I've only been to the Robinson location so I can't compare it to the other locations in the area. I personally believe that the hibachi chefs put on a great show.   My go-to is the hibachi chicken but I've also tried their shrimp & lobster. The hibachi meals come with soup, salad with their delicious dressing, noodles, rice and your meat choice (or there is a veggie option) I'm literally obsessed with the shrimp sauce.. yum!!   Service from the servers are sometimes spotty. Friday when we were here, i think the girl became overwhelmed. She messed up some drink orders & forgot others. the next thing you know a new server came along. The hibachi chefs and the food make up for the servers.   I've never tried their sushi so i can't comment on that. I love the hibachi meals so much that i just stick with them.",

I swear the wait staffs look like zombies!! They weren't very welcoming nor polite. That totally ruined my mood. Then the habachi cook serves our food sloppy. I mean our food was literally pouring off the side of the dishes. What's worse, our whole table ordered filet mignon. I swear to you it was a mixture of reg steak. Filet mignon is suppose to be soft & melts in my mouth but this steak was very chewy & not it! Besides this the food was seasoned good & everything came out like its suppose to.",

I still sneak in for lunch when I can because it seems a little less abrasive",
