Yes, it looks super janky on the outside, but don't let that deter you.  Whenever I try a new Thai restaurant, I order the same item, in order to fairly judge against other restaurants. My go to is Pad Thai. Here are my thoughts:  - Serving size:  Huge. This was enough for 3 meals.  - Price:  Very reasonable  - Taste:  The heaping plate came out and the first thing I noticed was shrimp. EEK. Shrimp. I don't like shrimp. My fault though - the menu does say the default PT is with shrimp. I gently pushed the shrimp aside and dug in. The taste was good. It wasn't life changing, but I felt satisfied after my meal.   To improve the taste, I recommend adding lime, green onion, as well as more crushed peanuts. There was one small piece of lemon I found on the plate, but lime slices would really be the icing on the cake.   - Service:  Was good. Hipster-looking waitress who was very attentive.",

Their menu is huge and I've been trying to get something different each time but you tend to form your favorites. They have delicious teas too, so if you get tea, I recommend the Three Blossoms tea, it is my absolute favorite! They're cash only so keep that in mind and you aren't able to be seated until your whole party has arrived so keep that in mind",

In order to fully appreciate Spice Island Tea House, you need to come here frequently so as to taste the wide variety of soups, rice and noodle dishes, and appetizers. The entrees are tasty and flavorful, if not absolutely delicious.  (I'm not impressed with their vegetarian spring rolls). Go through the other reviews on Yelp, and you will notice the wide variety of entrees that are recommended. The average price  of a dinner entree ranges from $9 to $15. Surprisingly, for such a small restaurant, they have a wine list  (I can't comment since I don't drink). A short wait for a table is typical, but the service is passable.  Highly recommended.",

But Pittsburgh is filled with little gems/charms. Spice Island being one of them. I never had something bad here, but try the Burmese Mohinga! It's a soup with thin noodles like no other. Richer than pho, and not as greasy as ramen, with a SE Asian flavor to it.  I'm tempted to make the 4 hour drive to Pittsburgh now just for this....",

But honestly, these always turn out to be the best restaurants! Once we were inside, we noticed the little candles and whimsical wall decorations.  We were promptly seated, and we were handed menus. There were so many delicious sounding options that I was very overwhelmed. I have never really had Thai food before, but I had read the reviews on Yelp before going, so I was prepared to try the Night Market Rangoon Noodles. I also tried Thai Ice Tea for the first time. The food took a good twenty minutes to come out, but it was definitely worth the wait.  HOLY. Everything was so good. From the DELICIOUS tea, to the humongous steaming plate of noodles, it was definitely wonderful. I finished less than a third of the plate before I was full, so I ended up getting it packed home and I had a nice midnight snack as well ^_________^ I can't wait to come back here!",

I'm speaking here of their island rice, green curry, lemongrass beef, coconut shrimp, GINGER SALAD, and ....white rice? Can't leave that out.

I was immediately intrigued by some of the interesting-sounding appetizers, like the deep-fried hard-boiled egg (which was okay, but not really memorable) and the Burmese squash fritters (which was a lot like squash tempura--all right, but I was expecting something more patty-like).  They do a pretty good samosa, though.  For entrees, a bunch of people have recommended the Rangoon Night Market Noodle--but maybe it doesn't translate well when made vegetarian, as I wasn't impressed.  It was just a whole lot of noodle.  Maybe it really does need the pork.  My favorite entrees include the Vegetarian Curry Trio and Monsoon of Vegetables.    The first three times I went to Spice Island, they were always out of the chocolate samosas on their dessert menu.  Maybe I hyped them up in my mind too much, but I wasn't wowed when I finally was able to get them on my fourth visit.  I do recommend them over the mango tiramisu, though.  If you like, they can make your desserts a la mode--with Dave & Andy's ice cream, from just down the street.",

My pad thai was not only inexpensive, but also served in a huge portion, letting me make it my lunch the next day as well (I'm cheap like that). While our server got my order wrong at first, she was super nice and apologetic about it and replaced it with the correct dish immediately.

Hubs and I were starving after spending all day at the Science Center. It took us forever to find legitimate parking and it definitely didn't help that it was move-in day for all the university students. I take that star off b/c unless you live in the neighborhood, it's almost impossible to expect to find a place to park within a 2-mile radius.   So...the food--very good! The selection was interesting and varied, which is what attracted me in the first place. I ordered the Malaysian pork skewers with peanut satay sauce. It's what I expected and all the right flavors. I loved the coconut-steamed fluffy rice and the simple Asian slaw. I have to get my vegetables on, so it's a must-ask question for me at every place: \"does this come with a lot of vegetables?\" I like that most Asian places incorporate meat and veggies very well together. This is very hard to get right at American establishments as I'm simply pointed to the vegetarian menu, but that's not what I want.  Hubs got the bun cha which had pork that was way too thinly sliced. I think Spice Island is good at the Thai/Malaysian/Singapore cuisine part but falls slightly flat at the Vietnamese part. His portion was kind of small and he finished rather quickly. Mine was a decent size and filled me up. Prices were on the lower side, but not necessarily \"cheap.\" I'm not sure what UPitt and Carnegie Mellon students are used to but \"cheap\" at Ohio State campus meant between $7 - $9 entrees and an optional tip. This place was more like $11 - $14 entrees and a waitstaff.  My waitress was friendly and had suggestions too. Their house hot sauce is marinated red pepper flakes and chili oil, which is the type I prefer. Fun place! Would recommend if someone else were driving and if I were in the neighborhood.",

It was just not the same.  The atmosphere at the Teahhouse used to feel warm and inviting.  Today it just looked dingy, the walls looked dirty and the tables looked as if they had each come from the salvation army.  Literally, the walls were dirty, with dried flecks of hot sauce and soy sauce from years of people sitting at the tables and the walls never being cleaned.  It was pretty gross.  A good pass of a Mr Clean Magic Eraser could totally fix that.  It sounds like I hate this place,  I don't, it's just that I remember it being such an incredibly cool place to eat.   What is still amazing is the tea.  Apricot black tea was on special and it tasted as delicious as it smelled.  I was about to order the red basil chicken, but the waitress warned it was made with bone in chicken.  I hate bone in chicken, so I opted for the chicken curry and I got it as a platter with salad and two samosas.  My friend had the pad thai with their chicken soup.  He said the chicken soup was incredibly bland, the main flavor being salt.  My side salad was ok.  the ginger dressing was very good.  The chicken curry was a huge let down.  I hate when food is hot and spicy without any flavor.  The chicken curry was all heat, and I had to add soy sauce for flavor.  Unfortunately the soy sauce just made the dish salty, and it was still hot.  THe coconut rice is what made it edible, and of course we still had that excellent tea to get us through.  The chicken curry didn't taste like curry at all.  It just tasted hot, and i was very bummed out.  The food was inexpensive and the service was good.  because I do have such fond memories of this place I will be back, but I won't go out of my way to dine here again.  One note, the Spice Island Tea House now has a liquor license and offers a small selection of wine and beers.  You can still BYOB, so long as you dont bring a wine that they sell there.  Also, you will need to wait for all members of yoru party to arrive before you are seated--EVEN if there is no one else in the dining room.  This happened today.  There was no one there when I first arrived.  It was not a big deal, there are lots of comfy places to sit while you wait, but I thought this was kind of ridiculous given I was the only patron there.  Oh well, rules are rules!  People love this place, I am really hoping that I was just there on an off day bc I totally want to rekindle my relationship w the Spice Island Tea House!",

My boyfriend is from Singapore, so it's difficult to find a SE Asian restaurant that's up to his standards. The flavors here are extremely True to the region, but the dishes are much less spicy than the actual dishes. Really love the Malaysian Beef Rendang, Singapore Char Kway Teow, and Paratha from here, and we get these every time we go to Spice Island. Overall, it's a wonderful place to check out. Just be aware of the limited parking situation!",

The dishes are plated delicately and they cook their tofu perfectly, which is *sadly* uncommon in Oakland. In addition to a wide variety of teas (pro tip: Mango Indica or English Garden), there are also imported beers and ginger beer cocktails.   It's such a quaint place to catch up with friends or go on a casual date (or self-date hehe). I cannot believe how many times I passed this place before realizing it was a restaurant, but in my defense, it's beside the drunk-food pizzerias, so it's easy to miss. I've never had experience with bad service here, though I removed one star because the entrees are a bit pricey.",

And of course, parking in Oakland is always tricky. But it is so worth it, because when you step through the curtains, you are about to get the most delicious food around. I've never taken a bad bite here, but highly recommend the pad Thai (it's just yummier than any other pad Thai I've had), and the corn and shrimp fritters (the dipping sauce is outrageously good). If they have it when you are there, don't pass up the Thai basil creme brulee either. Dessert is a virtue.",

I spent several months in S.E. Asia, and the food is fairly authentic.  On my most recent visit, I ordered the Pad Thai.  While it was pretty good, it didn't blow me away.  The portion size was large enough that I ended up taking half of it home to consume the next day.  I also ordered green tea, which was good, as well.  (I'll have to try the Thai iced tea next time I come, since I'm on an iced tea kick.)  There are many vegetarian options on the menu, so this is a good place to bring vegetarians for a meal.  The atmosphere is intimate and quaint, with interesting decorations, and service has always been decent.  Overall, I recommend this place if you're looking for Asian food in Oakland, particularly for students looking for a place to take the folks and for dates, or for a place to have a business lunch.",

The space is homey and quirky, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the food is really outstanding (and plentiful) for the price.  My friend and I shared the tea leaf salad to start. It's a fantastic combination of greens, nuts/grains, garlic, and vinegar, and just has an amazing flavor. One of my favorite restaurants back in San Francisco serves a similar dish, and this one was on the mark.  For dinner we had the mango pork and the chicken and green beans. The mango pork is one of those deep, earthy dishes with tons of unctuous flavor, not to mention some damned tender chunks of pork. Surprisingly, I couldn't really taste any mango in the dish, but it didn't matter a whole lot. Came with a nice side of jasmine rice (just slightly undercooked, which was a shame), a nice cabbage and red onion salad, and a little wedge of fry bread.  The green bean and chicken stir fry was really addictive. It came enrobed in a delicious and spicy chili sauce, with fresh string beans and incredibly tender chicken.  The staff was really friendly and attentive, and because there was no way we could finish our huge dinners, packed up the leftovers for us afterwards. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I'm definitely coming back!",

The first couple times I went to Spice Island I was unimpressed and then I ordered what my friends had been ordering all along, although I got it made vegetarian with Tofu. I was shocked, the food that I had found bleh and boring became something that pleased my taste buds. I never fail to be pleased by the Java Fried Rice, unlike some places where you make a meat dish veg they dont over do it with crappy vegetables instead using veggies that enhance the dish and blend well with the flavors. It is served piping hot in a portion that I doubt i have ever finished, the quantity of foo dmakes it so that I often end up with enough food for another meal.

Delicious, with a curry and garlic flavor, but not an overpowering flavor, plus very tender.  Finally, I love their little samosas. While they are fried, they don't seem heavy. Light and delightful, with an accompanying sweet sauce.  Oh they also have a HUGE tea menu, although I've never ordered myself a pot. But if you're into that sort of thing, they've got a big menu!

    "text": "Slow lunch service, bad for large groups, and poor lunch menu options.  Restaurants catering to the lunch crowd should all meet certain criteria:   1) Speedy service - Spice Island, on a consistent basis, is slow at preparing meals. They are slow at delivering appetizers, drinks, and entrees...and then, when the meal is all done, they aren't proactive in getting you your tab. All of these make it a less-than-ideal place for lunch. I have gone there at 11:30am, and at 1:00pm, and have experienced the same poor service.  2)conducive dining to groups (lunch crowds eat in groups, not alone). Spice Island has a long list of \"excuses\" when it comes to splitting checks amongst multiple people, the most ironic one being: \"To improve efficiency.\" Would have been a little more believable if the service was good. Nothing irks me more than dining in a group of 5, and then being unable to split the check, resulting in IOU's to your co-worker that you'd rather not be indebted to.   3) A unique and discounted lunch menu. Spice Island has a limited lunch menu, and one that is only about $0.50 less than the full dinner entrees --with much smaller portions. They don't really offer any incentive to go there for lunch, when you are getting lunch-sized portions at dinner-sized prices.   Overall, this place has consistently been bad. Slow service, poor menu options, relatively expensive meals, and difficult logistics make it a bad place to dine at for lunch -- and aren't offset by average quality food.",

I've been told in mid February that because one person in our four person party was not there yet that not only could we not be seated in an almost empty restaurant, but that we must wait OUTSIDE. in February. in the snow. We should have just left.  Another time, we had a large party and they had found a few tables to push together. The server left to do something else, so we figured we'd help out and start moving the tables together, only to have the server return and YELL at us to put the chairs down, as if we were somehow doing something terrible and dangerous. I was left speechless.  No amount of decent food could make up for how awful the service is here, but the food is often edible, if salty. The Pork Palou (sp?) is pretty good, and I like the coconut rice. But man, I can't believe the rudeness I've put up with from that place over the years.",

I hear there are other dishes on the menu, but I like my meat to be falling apart in delicious gravy, so I stick with these two.  Each comes with a small salad with a light, sweet dressing, a mound of coconut rice, which is very faintly sweet and topped with amazing fried onions, and a wedge of paratha, which I use to scoop up the gravy from the meat.  Everything is scrumptious, and I can never believe that these entrees cost less than $10 apiece.  I've also tried the Rangoon Night Market Noodle, which is delicious but will make you smell like garlic from 50 yards away.  The tea selection is also great, and the small beer list is pretty interesting.  Spice Island is closed Sundays (note: Zaw's is open Sundays and closed Mondays, so if you crave one when you can't have it, substitute with the other!) and is also sometimes randomly closed for private parties and the like.  Occasionally I've had to wait for a table for a good while.  But once seated, I've had a fantastic experience every single time.",

During this time, the dishes were not well prepared and the waitstaff was always rushing the customers. They seem to have rebounded though. I just had lunch there today, and its quality was what I remembered it to be from ages ago.  The positives: cheap & tasty.  They have a good selection of tea. Their dishes are vegetarian friendly.  The negatives: long wait, especially during lunch time, as they don't take reservations. the room's acoustic is such that it's really hard to hear other people even though they are sitting right across from you, shouting.  Overall, good lunch place. Score will be upgraded to 4 stars if the food quality remains consistent.",

The service was on point and top notch, but that could have been because they were closing soon and wanted to get everyone out. The food was fine. It had a lot of spice and flavor. The portions were huge. I got the Chiang Mai Noodles and the heat was present without being overpowering (I like spicy foods; if you don't, it will be too hot for you). I would have liked to have seen more vegetables and less noodles though. It was a plate with about a pound of noodles with only maybe 5 or 6 pieces of cooked vegetable present (hidden under the noodles, mind you). Overall, if it weren't for the tea, I would say this place is a 3-star place. The food isn't memorable and in fact left me a little disappointed. The tea, however, boosts it up to 4-stars. If you aren't planning on trying one of their awesome specialty teas, then I suggest getting your Asian fix elsewhere.",

If you like unapologetically greasy noodles with a good helping of pork and fried garlic, (and honestly, if you don't...what's wrong with you?!) then this is all you. -Mango Pork. Doesn't really taste like mango, but it's super tender, hearty deliciousness. -Ol Gaht. This dip made of shrimp paste and eggplant is strangely awesome. -Popiah. Okay, I love me some fresh spring rolls, and although this isn't my preferred Goi Cuon style roll, it's still really good.  But unfortunately, there are also some really awful things here: -Pad Thai. Mushy noodles with a way-too-heavy sauce and an unappetizing bright orange color. Doesn't taste like any Pad Thai I've ever had...not a good thing. -Green Curry. So bland. How is it possible to make curry this bland? -Penang Curry. Way too sweet, like a sugary gravy. Doesn't have that nice nutty flavor that I expect from this dish.  Other things from the menu have been hit or miss for me, but my main theory when it comes to Spice Island--stay away from the Thai food! We have plenty of Thai restaurants that know how to make decent Thai noodles and curries. Spice Island performs more favorably in the other areas of Southeast Asian cuisine. Honestly, the menu is almost too large for them to execute everything well. That's why I'm not in love with the food here...it's just hard to know what's good and what's bad.  Beer and wine only, but a small selection on either side. I kinda would like this place better if it were BYOB. Tea list is awesome though, try the Iron Goddess of Mercy Oolong!",

Spice Island is on my list of rotating Friday Lunch spots, so I've been there quite a few times. I try to get something different each time and have only been disappointed /once/ in the past few years. (Don't get the Chaing Mai here, it is NOTHING like Noodlehead's interpretations. It's more like spicy asian spaghetti.) My parenthesis aside, I've loved every dish I've gotten besides that and so have all of my friends.   I LOVE noodles, so I usually get something noodley, but do try all of the curries and meat dishes that they have too! Oh, and their thai salad is a really interesting addition to the start of your meal.

FOOD Every time I come here, I order Pad Thai (but no bean sprouts, please! Ugh!). I've tried other entrees like the Java Fried Rice (way too salty both times I had it) and a curry dish (not very memorable), but the Pad Thai has been the most appealing to me time after time. Portion sizes are always generous, and food comes out within 15 minutes.  Pad Thai comes with shrimp AND chicken together (SURF 'n TURF Pad Thai! But not really), which is fantastic considering how most places that serve Pad Thai only give you one protein option. Or you can go with just 1 meat (chicken or shrimp), or tofu. Spice Island's take on Pad Thai is a bit more saucy leaning towards the sweet side. It's not the best Pad Thai I've had, but that doesn't make it any less of a comfort food.   SERVICE Okay. They are definitely busy, and it shows when the server and owner don't smile much. Somebody tell them to relax a bit! Waters are kept filled and there isn't much wait time.  IMPRESSIONS This is my place to go to if I'm in the mood for a large helping of Pad Thai comfort food within a short walking distance from school. If you're looking for a good sit-down place in Oakland--that is not fast food--this is one of the few good spots I would recommend.",

We got recommendations from the server and ended up ordering the Vegetable Samosas, Java Fried Rice, Malaysian Beef Rendang, and a coconut cake with ice cream for dessert.  The samosas were tasty. I thought the fried rice and beef rendang weren't that spectacular, but they were good. The coconut cake with ice cream was scrumptious. I highly recommend it.  It was a nice experience overall, and I'll probably go back to try other dishes.",

I had the Burmese chicken curry and my son had the Malaysian beef rendang and they both were delicious. The service was friendly and the place was busy on a Saturday afternoon. The best way to describe the experience was a good home cooked meal with an Asian flair. They have a great selection of teas and mixed drinks. I had the Gin Gin Mule. Perfect balance of Gin and ginger with a touch of mint. Very refreshing. I'd give it 6 stars if that is possible.",

They can get busy at dinner time, and if you're coming with a group, your entire table must be there before they seat you. My favorite dish by far is the Java fried rice - it has a really yummy sweet soy sauce and plenty of chicken and shrimp. Portions are big too, even for lunch. My only gripe is that service can at times be unfriendly, but not every time I've been there. Make sure you bring cash because you get a 5% discount off your check!",

I would just recommend getting drinks from there because they have drink specials pretty much everyday of the week.   The food is absolutely delicious.

Since it was my first time there, I ordered my to go dish for Thai food which is Massaman curry.  I did not like it at all! It was watery and there were big chunks of onions which I thought was weird. It did not taste like any curry that I've had before. I really did not like it at all but that's just my tastes buds. The waiter was nice and asked if I wanted to pack it to go, i said no thank you. No way I was eating that.

As for the food, their portions are huge but the food is mediocre. They have a mixture of Burmese, Indonesian, Malaysian, and Thai dishes.

Oakland is known more for its college dive bars than its fine dining.) Spice island seems like it would fit in better in Shadyside.  The first time I went there back in 1997, I knew I wanted to try everything on the menu. My favorite was the Kway Teow. It's a spicy Chinese sausage. Very hard to find. I've only ever seen it on a menu at one other place. The slow cooked curries are superb.  If you've never been there, you have to go.  Often we would dine in AND order a meal to go in the same stop.  It's a great place in Oakland to take someone special or just pop in on a cold day and have some hot tea. If I remember correctly they usually have about 20 different kinds of tea on the menu.  I live in Texas now, but every time I'm back in Oakland, I make a point to go to Spice Island.",

I'm not sure my mango pork \"curry\" can be called that, but it the meat melted in my mouth and the flavor was very developed and balanced. The pad thai here is oddly red for some reason, and tasted sweeter and a bit out of balance, but nevertheless perfectly edible. The noodle dishes portions are HUGE and probably the best value on the menu. Apparently, meat on a stick is enjoyable, confirmed by multiple sources - definitely looked and smelled amazing!   From this I'd be willing to return to try more things! for the record, their thai iced tea is pretty good too - not as overwhelmingly sweet as some other places around the city would make theirs.

    "text": "I absolutely *LOVED* my entire experience @ the Spice Island Tea House!  PROS:   Delightful service! Delicious Food Despite appearances, (seemingly) very clean!! Very Inexpensive! Large (and cutely frugal looking) menus  CONS: Ugly facade (I almost didn't enter!)  BOOZE Situation: They are BYOB for no more than 750ml bottles (your standard bottle of wine) with a $10 corking fee; They also do serve beer.  My FAVE:  \"The Ever-famous Pad Thai\" (seriously, that's what its called)  My EXPERIENCE: I was greeted by a server named Danny. Danny is now my homeboy!!!    :D He was such a wonderful waiter, that I couldn't have wished for anything more out of a server!!  I have never been to Spice Island and my only previous Thai experience was @ another restaurant (which I love) on the Southside, so I don't have much of a basis for comparison, nor do really know \"what kind of Thai food [I] like\", as Danny put it.  I was clueless! I asked Danny if he could recommend a few things, which he was able to do quite well.  He pointed out several different dishes, asking questions about whether I like rice or noodle dishes, if I was a vegetarian and what kinds of meats I like. He was so helpful and polite the entire duration of my visit and was so nice about helping out someone who had no clue what they wanted to order.  I decided on a traditional dish--their \"Ever Famous Pad Thai\"--and it lived up to its name!  It was so good! A massive, steaming-hot portion slapped onto a large oval plate; it had a ton of shrimp which was perfectly cooked (and, praise the powers that be, de-veined) shrimp.  There was also chicken which was prepared in your basic Asian-type-of-cuisine style--thinly sliced and very soft (which I'm not so much of a fan of) and egg.  This was mixed in with thin fettuccine rice noodles, bean sprouts and tossed with a generous amount of sauce (but not dripped or sloppy). It was very tasty and I will order this dish again, its actually going to be difficult to try new things after having enjoyed this one once. In the future, I (to my picky weirdness about meats) might order it with no chicken and extra egg.  \"Yes, Danny, I am ready for the check--Thanks!\"     Pad Thai dish + Diet Coke = $10. and some change Yeah... seriously!  All in all, a great trip and a mere 6 hours later and I've already recommended it to 3 different people!  TIP:  Pray you go when that Danny is on duty! His boss should give him a raise for being so awesome at his job!!! (PS:  I do *NOT* know Danny, otherwise.  I was not previously his friend.  He was just sincerely *that* nice of a waiter and I appreciated it.)  RESTOOMS:  Although noticeably \"older looking\", they were very clean!",

    "text": "My relationship with Spice Island started a few years ago (and coincidentally is one of the first times I can remember consulting Yelp!).  Some friends and I were walking through Oakland dying from hunger and couldn't agree on a place to grab some grub.  Low and behold, open up the Yelp app and this place comes front and center.  We all agreed to try it out, and upon reaching the front door, I was convinced that it was a hoax.  DON'T LET THE FACADE FOOL YOU!  This joint is a great diamond in the rough.  Walk through the beat down facade and you're meet with a much more welcoming interior and a staff that is happy to wait on you.  As with most Thai/Asian eateries, there is no consistency on heat from a scale of 1-10.  I've order 10's, added hot chili oil and dried chili's and haven't broke a sweat.  Then I've ordered an 8 and walked out looking like I'd been stuck in a 100 degree closet with no AC for a day.  As the others, I highly recommend the Pad Thai.  Not sure what's exactly different about it, but definitely a little more sweet than others around the city with a distinctive red color.  Other great choices include the Rangoon Night Noodles, the Spicy Calamari, the Mango Pork, etc.  The choices are endless, so everyone can find something they'll like.",

    "text": "I ate here last night with my girlfriend for dinner.  Entering the restaurant is interesting as you head through a set of curtains to get inside.  Once inside though it feels homely with some old wooden floors and a comfortable atmosphere.  My girlfriend and I decided to start off our meals with the green-lipped mussels from New Zealand which came in a lemongrass and basil wine sauce.  After what could only have been a few minutes, it was served to us in a bowl with the mussels on a half shell with a bowl to discard our used shells.  The mussels themselves were good and my girlfriend thought that the sauce was even better and I enjoyed having them cooked on the half shell for a change.  For dinner I decided to have one of their specialties, the Burmese  Barbequed Chicken.  Normally I am not a big fan of bone in chicken but the description of the \"yogurt-honey-curry paste-lime juicy red hot chili marinade\" really had me intrigued.  Within minutes of our appetizer being finished my dish was served as two medallion sized chicken thighs and sides of molded rice topped with Vantana peas, a small salad and nan which all of their specialties come with.  The portion size of my meal was disappointing though between the chicken and  the nan which consisted of what looked like a single triangular piece of pita.  It's a shame that there wasn't more than a morsel of it though as it was buttery and tasted good.  My chicken was moist and had a nice slightly sweet taste to it but none of the underlying juicy red hot chili that I was looking forward to.  The salad and rice with peas were decent as well.  My girlfriend also though that the noodle dish which she ordered was underwhelming and I would have to agree.  It's not that our food was bad but it seemed to lack something that would have made it good. I do have to compliment the waitresses here though as they kept our water glasses full returning many times to fill them.  They were also very quick with the food and generally pleasant.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably not head back here in the future but I also would not avoid it.  It seemed like such a nice place and the service was fantastic but the underwhelming food made me wish that I had eaten at another Asian place.",

My friend introduced me to spice island tea house some time around 2003, and it has remained my favorite restaurant ever since.  Don't let the \"hole in the wall\" appearance fool you.   My usual dish is called \"Thai Ruby Red Basil Sauce\" (formerly known as Ruby Chicken).  It is full of flavor, the veggies are cooked perfectly, the chicken is moist and plentiful, and the sauce is perfect. I seriously can't say enough about how awesome this dish is.   I've also had the burmese fried rice, the pad thai, the chicken with string beans, the mango chicken, chicken satay, and the java friend rice. I have been more than pleased with EVERY dish! And I am very, very, picky (just look at my other reviews).   The other love is the vegetarian samoosas. The outside is perfectly crispy and crunchy and the filling is perfectly seasoned and moist. The sweet chili sauce that it is served with is the perfect compliment. I have often ordered 2 servings of the samoosa - one to eat and a serving to take home for later. They really are that good.   The tea is good, and I also really enjoy the coconut soda from time to time.   The servers have always been very polite and very attentive, even when the restaurant is PACKED on weekend nights.    I don't think I have one bad thing to say about Spice Island. Other than... maybe its time to expand and get some more parking!",

    "text": "This is one of the nicer sit down places in Oakland.  It's a bit of a hole in the wall place.  The front is very unassuming and it's quite small inside.  Recently, they even have the curtain down in front of the front door.  I'm not sure why--you have to open the door and then brush open the curtain to get inside.  It's Pittsburgh--I don't think it's that bright outside.    It's a pan-Asian restaurant with a variety of curry, fried rice, and meat dishes to choose from.   Recommended: Pad Thai--very filling and nice spices, though could use more shrimp. Malasian Sate Chicken with spicy peanut sauce--pretty nice sauce, though the chicken could have used some more browning.     Indonesian Festival Fried Rice--fresh cucumber with stir-fried vegetables and some coconut milk.  Very filling.   Java Fried Rice--very nice blend of bell peppers, chicken, shrimp, with sweet soy sauce.  It's garnished with egg strips and onion.  OK: my main objection to some of the meat dishes is that there are just meat and coconut rice.  It would certainly be nice if there were some more vegetables to accompany these.   Burmese Fried Rice: there are some shrimp, but overall, a little bland. Mango Pork--I'd like a little stronger mango flavor.   Curry Chicken--good chicken, but the dish is mainly just chicken with a variety of spices and herbs Five Spiced Chicken--I like the spices on this chicken, but there is just some lettuce as garnish, and could use something on the side Malaysian Sate Chicken on skewers: nice browning and marinated  chicken with some peanut sauce  There's a different soup of the day.  Tuesday is hot and sour soup.  It's been a little off the past couple of weeks.  Thursday, they have soto curry, an Indonesian soup with beef and coconut milk.  This soup is delicious.    The hot tea is recommended as well, especially on cold days.    We frequently take visitors here for lunch.",

I genuinely think this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh, I went here recently after a Spice Island drought and fell in love again.   I had the Eggplant and Shrimp dish, it was savory and delicious. I cannot recall having a better meal in the past year. The dishes are on the level of E2, Park Bruge, and Eleven. I'm going back here ASAP, and can't wait to try their new drink menu. Here's a hint though: You can still bring your own wine, the waiter told me they were keeping the tradition alive. There's a $10 corking charge per bottle, a bit pricey, but what can you do.",

    "text": "You cannot get Pad Thai like this anywhere else. It's simply THE BEST.   We lived in Oakland for years and made Spice Island Tea House a regular visit. My husband and I could split an order of Pad Thai and an order of spring rolls and be comfortably full, spending less than $20 on takeout. We miss Spice Island very much, as we used to eat here about once every 2 weeks.  Should you try it? Yes  Ambience: It's certainly a hard place to find, but that's good because it's truly a hidden gem and will stay that way. On the outside, it looks terrible and hardly even has a legible sign to mark the front door. On the inside, its ambiance is quaint with low-lighting and refurbished antique-like deco that's sure to amuse and delight. They have a vibe all their own, and I'm having a hard time putting it into words.  To be honest, Spice Island was where my husband and I went on our first date. He introduced me to this place and it is now once of our must-visits when visiting Pittsburgh.   Service: Great! It gets busy, but the food generally always comes out very quickly.   Location: Convenient location for anyone living in Oakland (we were on Dawson Street), as this area of the city is very walkable. Perfect for students at Pitt too!   3 Key Tips: 1) Try their teas - they are incredible!  2) Pad Thai. I get it without spice and the taste/texture/temperature is perfecto, but you can have them add spice if you want it!  3) Dishes are large, enough for splitting if you order an appetizer with it!   Recommended Dish: Pad Thai for sure. I also like the Mango Chicken.",

    "text": "I've had Spice Island Tea House on my radar for months now and finally made it there this past weekend with a friend. It is right next to the pizza place he frequented in college, so we had no trouble finding it even though the sign is a bit faded. We walked in and were immediately greeted and seated by a hostess/server. It wasn't crowded when we arrived (maybe four of the twenty tables were full) but by the time we left the amount of guests had doubled. The decor is adorable, especially the string lights and plants. The place has a clean but worn and comfortable vibe....it's been there since 1995, and it feels like that in a good way.   We took a few minutes to peruse the menus and saw they serve alcohol! Asian food and a nice beer happens to be a favorite combination of mine. Their cocktails look great as well. I'll certainly be back to try the Bangkok mule. For food I went with the Pad Thai, and he had the Thai Red Chili wok fry with chicken. Our food arrived within twenty minutes or so, and we immediately began eating.   I can see why people rave about the Pad Thai here. It's incredibly rich with lots of egg and peanut and a delicious sauce that stands up to the accompaniments very well. I'll get it again but with more spice next time. I didn't specify a spice level when ordering (the waitress never asked and I totally forgot to be honest) so I assume what I received was the mild spice level. I requested Sriracha, which I was generous with, and that added a little kick. My friend loved his wok fry and said it was plenty spicy for him. It looked very flavorful, with a deep red sauce and lots of chilies. The portions of both dishes were quite large for the quality of food we received. I feel like sometimes the nicer Thai-style places give you a bit less for your money. We left full and satisfied with plans to come back very soon!",

    "text": "This is a nice quaint tea house with a good selection of teas to warm you up on a cold day.  These are brewed and served in ceramic teapots.  They also have an interesting menu of curries, brick oven baked breads and fritters for example.  A shrimp fritter appetizer was shared with my date and we both found it delicious.    Reversing roles in the famous Jack Spratt nursery rhyme I enjoyed the flatter, oilier man bread and she the puffier paratha. Based on a Yelp recommendation, she ordered the Burmese pork curry and enjoyed it but not enough to have the take home as a meal the next day.    I have a passion for green curry and took the waitress's suggestion for a large shrimp green curry.  I enjoyed the dish and the leftovers the next day.   (Waste not want not).      I recommend Spice Island Tea House as a pleasant restaurant.  It is not highest among many options for Eastern food but is enjoyable.  Parking can be tricky in this section of Oakland, so be aware.",

All of the staff was sitting at a table drinking tea and hanging out. We ordered a really good blended tea and appetizers my boyfriend got the fish cakes said they were decent I got the ginger salad which I love. I ordered the basil fried rice which had zero flavor and not hint of basil. I doused it in the chili oil to get it down. My boyfriend got their \"specialty shrimp\" which were a few large shrimp in a weird thick sauce that reminded me of Swedish meatballs . Gross.  Last time we ate here we loved our meal. Most likely won't be going back.",

    "text": "Finally decided to stop by Spice Island for dinner after all the wonderful reviews I read on here. Maybe I came in expecting too much, but walked out of the restaurant quite disappointed. I mean the food was edible, just not fantastic. Atmosphere was warm and cozy, and service was fast and on point.   I ordered the mango pork. First of all, I just want to say that I don't think the price is worth it for the portion. I paid ~$12 for a small bowl of pork and scoop of coconut rice, with a few strands of vegetables and a tiny slice of naan out of pity. It's not painfully expensive, but still on the pricier side, deserving \"$$\". The coconut rice was very good, and probably my favorite thing on the plate. The mango pork tasted exactly like curry pork. I couldn't find a hint of mango anywhere. Meat was soft and melted right in my mouth, but the seasoning was just average--a little too salty. All of the friends complained about the quantity and quality of their food as well. The one friend ordered their vegetarian pad thai and ended up with sour tofu in her pad thai. My assumption was the tofu went bad.   Overall the food here is edible, but I will not return due to the price, quantity and quality. I don't think their food is worth $12 because I could get the same thing for half the price at a food cart elsewhere. If you do decide to come here, one suggestion: Make sure you double check their TOFU.",

I hear the food is really good; I'll come during a meal next time to try some. Server was not overbearing. Good luck finding parking on the street, which is $$$ anyway.  Came back six months later, and I still like the place. Hubby and I arrived early, before the dinner rush, and they agreed to seat the 2 of us because I wanted to order appetizers. Our party of 4 eventually ordered from all parts of the menu, and we were extremely happy with our dishes. Portion sizes vary: the Burmese chicken curry was too small to split, so we got an Indonesian salad, and that was more than we could eat together. The spring rolls were also delicious. Parking is still scarce and $$$.",

The atmosphere was so cool and the food was wonderful! I had the Lemongrass beef which was so flavorful and simply delicious. My husband had the Mohinga Of Burma which he said was amazingly tasty. Our daughters had Tofu salad dishes and they both cleaned their plates--unusual for them. My husband and I also enjoyed the cocktails and the girls liked the choice of teas. What a great value too.

The chicken sate skewers were juicy and could be eaten with or without dipping into peanut sauce. If you're not a big eater, the sides that came with the skewers could be a bit daunting - we saw quite a few patrons leaving with doggy bags.  The only bad thing to say about the food was that the vatayna rice was bland and dry (mixed with peanut sauce, it was nice. Next time, I would keep the sweet soy sauce from the appetizer to use on the rice).  Would definitely go again!",

    "text": "After eating here several times over years I rate this a solid SE Asian option for Pittsburgh. The real casual as opposed to faux casual atmosphere and friendly, helpful staff keep the rating up to a solid 4 stars.  The food is tasty and greasy and reasonably priced with large portions. My favorite is the spicy noodles listed after the Pad Thai on the menu. It has a slightly more Chinese brown sauce flavor but I like the added spice. The vegetables vary and the rice noodles are wider than Pad Thai. I wish the sauce was a bit lighter but I imagine that doesn't bother the locals.   The hot and iced teas of the day are always fun to try.",

    "text": "I hardly need to add to the long list of good reviews, so I'll keep this short.  Positives:  As a soon-to-be Pitt employee, I'm awfully glad that this place is just around the corner in Oakland.  Good menu of (I think) Thai and Burmese dishes.  Fantastic tea menu with a nice group-couch area up front seemingly for those who just want tea and conversation.  Nice art and furniture.  Well organized menu.  Lots of healthy items, and just about anything can be made vegetarian if that's your thing.  Very affordable; one person could easily do a filling lunch for ~$10 with a drink.  And prompt service with a smile.  Negatives:  Minor things, really.  The menu is a tad long, though admittedly, there are some interesting dishes that you don't normally see in a SE Asian restaurant.  The lighting is great if there's some sun in the sky, but was a bit too dim on a cloudy 2/10/2010.  My dish--the Garden Veggies with Sweet Ginger Sauce and tofu--tasted great, but was way too saucy.  More veggies, less sauce, would have made it perfect.  Lastly, it's unfortunately got a very unappealing facade, but don't judge this place by the cover.  I plan to return and to recommend it highly to others.",

From walking by, it doesn't look like the greatest place, but they have an interesting menu with different asian/asian fusion dishes so there's a little bit for everyone from the exotic to the simple.  The Malaysian Sate, which I had with beef, was delicious and came in a more than adequately sized portion. The Pad Thai is also a delicious meal. All of the appetizers and other dishes I tried were more than satisfactory.   For a student on a budget, this place is both delicious and relatively inexpensive.

The tea bar is extensive, with a wide variety of blends beyond your everyday greens, blacks, and herbals; the waitress serves teas stewing in the pot with a time estimate on when the tea will be perfectly brewed and delicious. The food was fast, good, and very hearty, with enough leftovers to serve me for dinner as well, and kind and helpful waitresses came and checked on me numerous times during my meal, despite almost all the other tables being full. All in all, an excellent experience, and I give it two thumbs up.",

    "text": "I decided to go to this restaurant after reading quite a few good reviews. We were seated promptly and got water and orders placed quickly. I ordered the mango pork, and when the food arrived at the table I sensed something was wrong. My food looked and tasted EXACTLY like beef rendang. I've had beef rendang hundreds of times starting in my infancy, it's a staple food in my life, and this was it. It had small chunks of potatoes in it, and a coconut milk taste like mentioned in the menu. Clearly not mango pork.   I asked the waitress if my food was the beef rendang or the mango pork, and she absolutely insisted it was the mango pork. I mentioned that there was no \"pickled mango\" like mentioned in the menu (in fact, no mango taste at all) and she just said the beef rendang was green-tinged, there was no actual mango in the mango pork, and I definitely had the mango pork. She did not address my concerns about the difference in ingredients/menu description at all. Also, beef rendang is never green, so I don't know what they would be serving as beef rendang. I highly suspect they just didn't want to admit their mistake and therefore remake my food.  The food was actually pretty good, which is a pity because the whole experience made me not want to go back. I love southeast Asian cuisine because it reminds me of home, but I specifically didn't order the beef rendang because I wanted to try something different. The rendang was decent but just flat-out not what I ordered. I'd have been fine if they just messed up my order, because I know mix-ups happen, but the wait staff seemed unwilling to do anything about it besides just insisting my food was something it wasn't.",

It was sort of my introduction to hip, local spots with a focus on food and it was definitely the first Southeast Asian I had experienced.  I've returned many times throughout my visits back to Pittsburgh. And I'm not sure if my tastebuds have changed or they've started to sell out (they do focus on some cheesy cocktails now when it used to be BYOB), but it wasn't quite the same.  It was so quiet on a Saturday night at 8pm. We were seriously one of only two tables in the entire place. I realized it might be because school is out for summer. But it was a bit disconcerting.  I ordered the same thing I've gotten here for 10 years - the Shan Hin Lay Pork. I remember the pot roast texture and tenderness of the pork with a sweet brown sauce and great coconut rice. Well, this time around I noticed the meat was rather fatty and that sauce was pretty bland.   I will say the other dishes were all pretty good. I do remember their great spring rolls. The pad thai had a tangy sweetness that you don't always find in Thai restaurants. And the Penang Curry was bright and spicy.  I think it might be time for me to move on. If I do come back here, it will probably be for nostalgia sake and I may have to retire my regular dish and try something with a bit more oomph. But then again, who am I kidding? I'm a creature of habit and I only come to Pittsburgh once in a blue moon. It might be nice to act like I'm in college again. By eating bland, fatty pork.  -eatthisny",

But the deep-fried hard boiled egg (2 eggs actually) with tomato chilli sambal was DELICIOUS! Everything about that dish makes me want to eat it again and again.

I decided to try these guys because I was looking for something a little wacky, and also a little Asian. ;)  I was in the mood for some sort of tasty salad, and the first one listed on the menu was the Gado! Gado! (yes, that's the way it was written on the menu). The rest of the menu was pretty extensive with lots of different pan-Asian and Southeast Asian-ish dishes.  The salad was good, a mix of poached cauliflower, broccoli, and green beans with raw bean sprouts and cucumbers. The whole thing was covered with a sweet peanut sauce. It was quite nice, although the peanut sauce became a little too much towards the bottom of the salad (it was SOAKED). The portion was quite large, definitely enough to be my full dinner with a side of white rice.  I also ordered the \"Ice Tea of the Day\" which was Jasmine today. It was good. Not really very special, except that ordering ice tea at any other place gets you Lipton's \"finest,\" ya dig.  I would definitely go there again to try some other stuff on the menu. It also looked like a nice place to bring a date or meet friends. The wait staff when I was there was a pair of young and friendly women who seemed eager to make the guests' experiences pleasant.  My whole meal (the three things listed above) was about $9.50.",

Luckily there's a nice beer list here to accompany the delicious Asian cuisine!  The menu is full of soo many dishes that are atypical for the standard Asian restaurant menus.  It took almost 15 minutes just to figure out what to order, many of the dishes I'd never seen before sounded quite appealing.  *Go here if you want a break from the typical Asian food and want to explore things you've never tasted*  I went with a Malaysian dish, slow-marinated beef with spices and coconut milk (can't remember the name - but it's on the \"off the beaten path\" menu under \"Malaysia\").  It was FANTASTIC!  The beef was so tender that I could poke it apart with my chopsticks with no knife, and the flavor was phenomenal.  Notice: I said \"poke\" it apart with chopsticks... they don't automatically give you chopsticks here for some reason, and the food doesn't always come out ready to be eaten with chopsticks.  That undermines the authenticity a little too much for me, hence the 4 stars.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is warm, dim litted, and peaceful, however, we were getting takeout so we didn't stay in the restaurant for long. I ordered Singapore Char Kway Teow without shrimp. My mom's order was more special. After describing the dish that she hasn't been able to get for almost a decade, the hostess went back to the kitchen to see if it could be recreated. My mom began to cry when she came back saying that yes, they could make it. For those wondering it is a ground chicken dish with mint, rice, and jalepeno. When we received our food and got home we found that the food was as good as we'd remembered except that my mom had to add jalepeno to the chicken. My noodles were delicious and they brought back strong memories of eating them before. I think we were both feeling nostalgic that night and to me that's how good food should make you feel.",

    "text": "I've been here multiple times already and the food is really yummy! I've tried their Java Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and Singaporean Rice Noodle - which are all delicious! The best part is that they all come with combination of proteins (chicken, beef, and shrimp) - so no need to choose between any of them! They're really flexible with making the dish milder or spicier so don't be afraid to ask the waiter for a customized order.  I've had really positive experiences here. The waiters are usually very friendly and cooperative - and the food comes out relatively fast. This place can get busy during popular dinner hour so expect to wait a bit sometimes - especially with larger groups.   Definitely would recommend this restaurant! Can be a bit \"pricey\"! Dishes are about $12 each.   Aside: If you don't like \"sweet\" pad thai, then I would not recommend it from Spice Island. I personally am not a big fan of the sweet flavor.",

From the outside it doesn't look like there is anything there but don't be fooled there is such a nice restaurant inside. It is Thai food and it is decent. I am giving three stars because there are better Thai places in Pittsburgh and this place lacks a little bit of the kick that i look for in Thai food. Otherwise my friends as well love it and it's not too pricey for a college town and really nice when you want to go somewhere randomly but don't know where. Definitely worth a try and I normally get the red curry and chicken skewers which I have to say are amazing! enjoy!",

I ordered the java fried rice and I am  in heaven! It has a sweet taste and the rice is moist without being saucy. The java fried rice has chicken and shrimp and you can adjust the heat to your liking. The portion of rice that you receive is honestly enough to fill two people! The staff is really friendly, and they even offer 5% off your bill if you pay in cash! Great food and discounts, I am so in!

The atmosphere of the restaurant is great. It is such a relaxing place with dim lights and candle. Their menu got good selection of Asian food, many things I tried prior to this review were all on point!  This time both Me and my friend both ordered their Burmese chicken curry with coconut rice.

Check out the teas, there are some really interesting options available.  If you have dietary restrictions, this place is very accommodating. Dish contents are clearly listed on the menu, and the waiting staff is very knowledgeable about spices and seasonings used in the kitchen. Don't be afraid to ask if you need an accommodating.

Menu is easy to navigate, with so many options, and vegan & vegetarian items clearly marked.

Service is always fast and dishes are always so consistent, flavorful, with large portions so always leftovers to take home. LOVE their fresh Thai rolls, as they're made with Popiah skin which is a very thin crepe like flour rather than the traditional rice papers, very different and so far the only place in Pittsburgh I've found these.

Little fact this place does offer gluten free options.  I was surprised by its variety of Southeast Asian options on one menu. I personally tried the Burmese pork and coconut rice and added a side salad. The salad was phenomenal and I was taken back by the complexity of flavors within such a simple dish. But the pork was everything! It was absolutely one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. The meat was so tender and full of flavor. The spice of the pork alongside the sweetness of he rice was perfect.  I also sampled the three veggie curry that my colleague had and it was amazing.

We also had an appetizer of a flatbread with a meat curry as well as a Thai iced tea. I will say that the meat curry sauce was probably my favorite part of the whole meal. Both of our dishes were pretty great and came out quickly, but not TOO fast... if you know what I mean.  As you may know, the Pad Thai comes with chicken and shrimp. If I were to go back, I would probably ask if I could get all shrimp or maybe vegetables instead. Some of the chicken was kind of... questionable. Maybe just overcooked. But the sauce and noodles were absolutely delicious.  One thing I do want to note is that unlike a lot of other local Thai places, they do serve alcohol. You do have the option to BYO but it's a $10 corking fee.",

It is a delicious mix of eggplant, potato and green beans (the magical trio) and red curry sauce.  A sauce can really make or break a curry and Spice Island's definitely makes it!  It is savory, mildly spicy and very flavorful.  I think my favorite thing about their lunches, though, is that they are the perfect portions!  (Nutrition Nerd Alert!)  Come in hungry and you will feel wonderfully satisfied, but not over-stuffed, and not obligated to take a pile of food home.  The waiters and waitresses are always really chill and courteous.  The ambiance is simple and a tad dark (perfect for a hot summer day!)",

    "text": "Spice Island Tea House is a good restaurant but not amazing. I went on a Wednesday night. Because they're pretty small they can fill up fast. We got there at 6 and by 6:30 every table was taken and had gotten pretty loud. The service was quick and attentive. They were very accommodating.   I can't give this place more than three stars is because I just wasn't impressed by their food. I heard the pad thai was good but it just wasn't that great when I ordered it. The sauce is very sweet with not a lot of depth to it. I thought it could have used more spice or something fresh like green onions or cilantro. Nor was I impressed with their \"spicy\" laht nah. Its favor was really lacking.  Over Spice Island is good run of the mill thai restaurant with good prices and portions. For vegetarians out there, they are accommodating but almost everything on the menu comes with chicken and shrimp. I would go back if I were in the area but I would definitely order differently.",

    "text": "I'm a sucker for a heaping, steaming serving of fried rice.  I'm even more of a sucker for spices, both complex and fiery.  Combine the two and you get my favorite dish at Spice Island- a dark brownish fried rice that is rich with spice, bursting with flavor and all around delicious and satisfying.  I've also had one of their curries which was solid, but truly I will return for the fried rice.  Also the decor is charming- sort of tropical Asian inspired.  And their tea menu is surprisingly deep- it's worth digging through if you're into high quality tea.  Delivery is always fun because you get to eat fried rice from a Styrofoam container, which for me brings me back to childhood/college and therefore adds an extra layer of delicious nostalgia.",

    "text": "Spice Island is popular among our hospital crew to order from for lunch in Oakland (via Wheel Deliver).  I have never actually been in the restaurant, so my review will be based strictly on the food.    I have had the pad thai and java fried rice from Spice Island, and both are just OK and forgettable.  The biggest complaint I have with each dish I've had is that the quality of meat and seafood is not very good.  The shrimp in my pad thai was strange tasting and tough and the meat I've had in other dishes was fatty.  Another pet peeve of mine is the amount of grease and oil in the dishes.  I expect a certain amount of oil, but this literally leaves puddles of the stuff at the bottom.  Finally, each dish I've had is disappointingly flavorless.   The portions are HUGE, but I'd rather pay for less food with more flavor.    I have heard great things from friends about Spice Island, so I'd like to actually go to the restaurant to eat some time...but I think I'll be passing for lunch for now on.",

    "text": "I discovered Spice Island through a co-worker about 8 years ago.  As other reviewers have said, the exterior is nondescript and kind of sketchy looking--v. easy to pass right by without noticing what's inside.  But don't let that deter you from going in and sampling some of the best Pan-Asian food in the City.  I like hot tea, and when I saw that Spice Island had a separate menu just for tea (kind of like a wine list at other restaurants), I figured their tea must be pretty good and gave it a try.  And it is.  Over the years I've probably sampled a dozen or so varieties of tea from the menu, and they were all good.  The hot tea is also a wonderful complement to the food, I think.  My favorite appetizer is the shrimp fritters.  It's a good appetizer size, enough for two, served with a tangy vinegary sauce on the side.  Their salads are also very good, too.  It's hard to beat their fried rice dishes.  Cast aside any prior experience or association you may have with fried rice--those soy sauce laden monstrosities that many restaurants pass off as food.  Their fried rice is flavorful, peppered with vegetables, meat, and a bit of heat.  The portions are huge--I have yet to finish an entire portion in one sitting.  So the bonus is a free lunch the next day!  Service is friendly and efficient, even when the place is jumping.  For the amount of food you get and the quality of food, it's one of the best bets in the city.  If you're looking for a fancy place with cloth napkins, beautifully designed interior, this is not it.  Spice Island offers delicious, authentic food served in somewhat humble (but warm and cozy) environment.  In this respect, it reminds me of its restaurant cousin, Tram's in Lawrenceville (great for authentic, inexpensive Vietnamese cuisine).",

We had lunch -  shrimp pad thai and their version of chicken panang. I found the Pad Thai to be sweet and extremely saucy and unfortunately I questioned the 'chicken' that was in my pad thai. Everything on the lunch menu is about 8.50. Personally I've had way better but, I'm not Thai, I've never been to Thailand and the place had a steady flow of ppl so what do I know! Its small and quaint to say the least, dark and unique.  The outside is a lil misguiding but its clean enough and they didn't waste any money on anything, even the menus are cheap, random and possibly homemade - I'd venture to say that nothing there was purchased new. At least this place will be around for a while and the prices have no reason to go up.  Our waiter was nice, and it's not very often that I find places that sell Burmese dishes. Stop by for a try if you're in the area.",

Now, Spice Island has been downgraded to 3 stars. I still go back for the nostalgia of it all. (I did used to eat here once a week.) The food is just not as good anymore. To me it tastes like what used to be good food but now has been mass produced so it's lost a lot of the refined flavors. The sauces used to be awesome, now not so much.   My favorite dishes were/are: pad thai and chicken with string beans. It's still okay, but when you start off outstanding, okay just won't cut it. 3 stars for Spice Island, and mostly just for old time's sake.   Since this is an asian restaurant, and us asians are taught to strive for perfection and settle for nothing less, Spice Island's mom would say \"What happened to the other 2 stars?\" *  __________________ * Painting a very broad stroke here, when an asian student goes home with a 97 on a test, his or her (or my) mom says, \"What happened to the other 3 points?\" It's negative reinforcement at it's best.",

Spice Island is ideal for a quiet dinner with a small group. They serve fairly large takeout portions as well. Prices are very reasonable compared to other Thai places in Pittsburgh.   The Chiang Mai noodles in my opinion were not as good as others I have tried, and the vegetables in garlic sauce were mediocre. The garlic sauce was very good, but the vegetables tasted as though they had been frozen. I do like Spice Islands Pad Thai.

    "text": "hole in the wall spot for tasty southeast asian noodles, curries & rice dishes! i've been on many occasions over the years and have always left satisfied. the food is filling, sometimes a bit oily but still delicious.  the java fried rice is my go-to, the perfect balance of sweet and savory, comes in a generous portion and has plenty of protein - both shrimp and chicken! prices are around $10-12 for dinner entrees. portions are large enough that you could split to two meals or eat the whole thing if you're hungry! the pad thai is also one of the better ones I've had in Pittsburgh.  my friends and i easily got a table for 4 at 5:30pm on a tuesday and service was prompt. the space is small and does get busy, so plan accordingly.  don't let the location tucked in the depths of south oakland fool you - spice island's food transports you with the flavors of southeast asia! bonus - 5% discount if you pay cash!",

The portions are pretty big so unless you have a huge stomach you can pretty much have another entire meal for the next day. Even though it's a small location there is usually a table open. Definitely not a good place for big groups, if you have more than 4 people in your party it might be a tight squeeze. A good place for some one on one time. The food is super great. Also the tea is nice.",

There's lots of Thai food in Pittsburgh, but Spice Island separates itself from the others by offering other styles, namely Burmese and Singaporean, and also having a lengthy tea menu!  Food here is solid all around, which really impresses me, considering how many cuisines they have to serve. My personal favorite is their Singaporean noodles, because of how savory it is. It's fun to pair curries or a mohinga, for example, which has more mellow flavors, with the Singaporean noodles.  The restaurant is also cozy, and very calming honestly for the guests. It's inviting for long conversations and just taking a break here.",

But I am happy to say I really liked it and it is much nicer inside than i guessed.    They have a great selection of teams, and a surprisingly good selection of Asian/Thai  style foods, better than I was expecting. I got the beef lemongrass special, my wife got the pad thai. I really liked the beef, the pad thai seems more like it was something that came from a large prepared pot, and I've had better. But it was their lunch special, so I suppose if you order it off the menu it may be better.  I loved the mint/gunpowder tea we had. Tea is.their speciality for sure, I look forward to trying more!",

I will keep coming back.   So before I posted this review I was in Oakland and came back. I had the Bermese pork curry with a side of coconut rice. This was from the lunch menu.  I had it with Thai coffee.  My daughters had Java fried rice (of course) with Thai tea and my sister pad Thai.   While the bermese curry was very flavorful it wasn't like a typical curry. The pork was very tender and it had potatoes as well.",

Whether it's Burmese, Thai, or Malaysian and that's just naming three of the cuisines they offer.   I've been here a couple times and each time, I leave wanting to come back because the menu has so much that I want to try from different cuisines. The first time, we ordered Chang Mai and Singapore rice noodles. The second time, we ordered the Malaysian Beef Rendang and Shan Tribe Hot and Sour Noodle Soup. Both times, we got samosas as our appetizer, which you can't go wrong with. I've enjoyed everything we've gotten here, including their creative cocktails. My favorite cocktails are the ones with their homemade ginger beer.  I definitely plan on revisiting Spice Island again and again. The space is intimate, making it a great setting for delicious southern Asian food.",

There are so many better places in Pittsburgh to eat.  I will never return.  We started with the soup of the day and a salad.  Both were ok, nothing special.  My partner ordered the Java rice and I ordered the Panang Curry.  The rice was ok.  The curry was disgusting.  Quite possibly the worst I have ever had.  It was too thick, like old gravy thick and had no flavor.  Literally no spice.  Embarrassingly bad.  The service our entire time there was nonexistent.  We had to flag someone down the entire time, had to re-explain simple requests like asking for straws multiple times and waited for our check for 15 awkward minutes.",

    "text": "OVERALL: my favorite Southeast Asian restaurant in Oakland. Delicious curries, warm and sweet coconut rice, and life-changing roti canai. The cons are that there is usually a long wait if you come during prime hours, and they don't have many vegetables in their curry entrees.  I'll start off by saying that I regret not eating at Spice Island sooner. Since discovering it three months ago, I've been there a total of about 6 or 7 times and definitely plan on going again. The food here is really phenomenal, flavorful, and always served hot.   My favorite dishes are the burmese pork curry, lemongrass beef curry, java fried rice, and roti canai. Seriously, if you come here, you have to order the roti canai! Every single time I've eaten here, no matter how stuffed I know I will become from the entree, I order roti canai - and I never regret it, despite my bloating stomach complaining afterward. However, the one dish I did not enjoy was the Chicken Malaysian Sate on skewers. I wasn't a fan of the peanut sauce, and the chicken seemed lackluster in terms of flavor and presentation.  One complaint I have about the food is that it is a bit too salty, and it could use some more vegetables. Whenever I order curry, the only vegetables it comes with are potatoes...which is terrific, because I love potatoes, but I do wish there were more greens and healthy vegetables in the dish. Also, the wait can get long due to the large amount of customers during peak hours. If you come, try and come before 11:30am or after 3pm for lunch, and before 6pm for dinner!",

    "text": "Came here with a large group of 10. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly we were seated considering that the restaurant was not that big. I ordered the Gutgyi Gut with seafood, nann with curry, and Thai Iced Coffee. Found the rice noodles to be quite soft and pleasing to the mouth. The hot chili vinagrette sauce was also good, although the spice that it probably would have contributed to the noodles was watered down due to the watery nature of the sauce. The naan bread with curry was nice, although the naan was not as soft as I would have liked ... found it to be a bit on the dry side (can be remedied if not toasted as long as it was). The Thai Iced coffee was pretty good ... sweet, but not to the point of overdoing it ... thankfully it did not leave me drowning in sugar. In general a great place to go. Ambiance is great, service is quick/friendly/accommodating, although I would suggest ... don't leave any leftovers as my entree leftovers did not taste very good afterwards. Overall, a good place to go for Asian food!",

Rice noodle dishes (like Singapore Noodles and Pad Thai) are especially well executed.",

Maybe its because it's surrounded by ramshackle student housing on Atwood street, but honestly don't judge by the exterior.  Inside is warm and inviting with low lighting and intimate tables. For drinks, there is a limited wine and beer list and also house specialty cocktails. The cocktails intrigued me the most so I went with the Gin Gin Mule (6.50) and wasn't disappointed.  The menu is extensive. Both my date and I went with noodle dishes. I went with the Singapore Rice Noodles while she ordered the \"famous\" Pad Thai. Both hit the mark and the Pad Thai lived up to its hype. The Singapore Noodles could have been a little spicier but the friendly waitstaff brought out hot sauce which helped with the spice level.  For appetizers we went with the vegetable spring roll and the deep fried hard boiled egg. The rolls didn't stand out any more than other places around town, but the fried egg was intriguing. If you like hard boiled eggs I would recommend this variation.   For a couple drinks, apps, and two entrees the bill was somewhere between 50 and 60 dollars.",

The menu is pretty extensive which took us much longer to decide on what to get. It had cuisines from Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore.   I got the Malaysian Sate Noodle with Seafood. The noodle to seafood ratio was somewhere along 4:1 and the dish was too greasy. So at one point I started to just eat the seafood and ended with a plateful of just...greasy non-sate tasting noodles.   Friend got the Spicy Laht Nah of Thailand. It was alright, nothing too fancy. Definitely have tried better elsewhere. And Laht Nah's just not meant to be made with minced chicken.   Aside from the fast service, the food was rather disappointing, which was kinda expected what with the million things they have listed in the menu.  For those that are looking for authentic Asian food, this is not the place.",

(To be honest, I really haven't tried many entrees on the menu because I am so enamored with the pad thai, but I've gotten appetizers and tasted friends dishes and they were all great.) The inside is cool, especially at night... it's very cozy looking. The employees are very kind.  I will miss Spice Island dearly when I move from Pittsburgh. Parking on Atwood will be tough, as it is everywhere in Oakland, so maybe plan on getting take out if you're not a student who lives within walking distance. But do not miss out on the food here.",

    "text": "Some of the best Asian food you can find in Pittsburgh, at least around the CMU/UPITT area.  I only went here once when I was a student - didn't remember too much, so one year after I graduated, I finally went back with some friends, and boy is it yummy!  My friends and I ordered 6 dishes.  I highly recommend the Rangoon Night Market Noodle - it's just thin flat noodles doused in sauce/oil/garlic, but it was sooo flavorful and so delicious.  The panang curry (my staple Thai food) was a bit thicker than what I normally see at Thai restaurants - this one had the consistency of gravy?! - but the flavor wasn't bad.   The Java fried rice was a big hit - that was gone in like 10 minutes.  I guess they use soy sauce and... maybe sesame oil?  Or some other cool kind of oil when frying the rice?  Either way, it was really freaking delicious, and I don't usually order fried rice when I'm out.  Thai iced tea is also DELICIOUS - perfect.  $2.50 for a glass is slightly expensive (no free refills) but oh well.  The interior decor is so so - kind of dimly lit, nothing special.  The menus seem kind of tattered - it's basically cardboard covers with some paper stuffed in - but don't let that fool you because it has inside deliciousness! (or rather, your gateway to deliciousness)  Also, everyone in your party must be present to be seated.",

    "text": "Spice Island doesn't look like much from the outside (you can barely tell it apart from the typical abandoned storefronts that litter South Oakland), but this is truly a hidden gem in Pittsburgh. I have been going here since 2006, and I've never had a bad meal at Spice Island.  Spice Island features Southeast Asian food, which I would describe as a harmonious fusion of southern Chinese cooking techniques with South Asian spices and local Southeast Asian ingredients.   There is a Burmese fish soup with rice noodles called Mohinga that is to die for (and is the perfect takeout option if you're recovering from a cold).   The tea leaf salad is a cheap and amazing pairing with a side order of coconut rice. There are a also a great variety of regional fried rices and appetizers.   I have noticed very little turnover amongst the service staff over the years and the service is always good - which I think is always a sign that the owner is doing something right on the people operations front of the business. Several years ago after a later day at work, I basically ran in there 15 minutes before closing at 2100 and they did not bat an eye, rush me or give me a dirty look.   If you pay by cash, you'll be able to get a 5% discount (although if you are with a party, it'll only take one idiot with no situational awareness using a card to bump you back up to the menu price).",

The second time I came, our party didn't order any drinks.  The attitude from the servers were completely different.  The waitress came by and asked us if we were still eating while we were still chewing our food.  What a f-king bitch.  Then again, another server came by later and did the same.  They were giving us the hints to leave.  I won't be back to this place for sure since their food sucked anyway.  They get a lot of business from the University and people liked to drink.  After a couple of drinks, anything came out of their kitchen would taste good especial when they add extra sugar.  Dont' come here if you like real Thai food.",

SERVICE - pretty good. Our waitress was attentive and helped me pick some appetizers. The restaurant itself is small-ish, and the atmosphere in the restaurant is very casual.  FOOD - I think you get a decently big-sized portion for the entrees, which I was happy with! Definitely had leftovers for later. My Rangoon night market noodle was tasty, and my friend liked his food too. We split some appetizers, which were yummy, but maybe a bit pricey considering how small they were.   As a heads up, this place is switching over temporarily to serving street food style dishes soon, with more info on their website. I'm actually more excited about what's coming up, so hopefully I'll be back to try that!",

But maybe it's too much for someone who isn't familiar with south east Asia food. Ask your waiters. They are willing to help.   I recommend you to try \"lemongrass beef\" in the curry and slow cooked selection. It is served with the rice cooked in coconut milk. The sweetness of rice goes quite well with spices in the curry.   Or if you like spicy food, try \"spicy chili fried rice with mixed seafood\".   Plus, don't forget to order tea here if you are a tea lover.",

The onions and peppers in my curry were not cooked at all and the chicken was a horrible rubbery consistency.  It was as though the chicken had been stewing in the sauce for hours and the veggies were added right before serving and given no time to soften.  The \"charred\" peppers in the wok dish were also severely undercooked and the chicken was overcooked. Overall, we were pretty disappointed as the place had such a high Yelp rating and was not enjoyable.  Perhaps the other dishes are worth a shot but it would take a lot of convincing for me to give it another chance.",

The pad thai is always a great standby with a great sauce that is pretty sweet and quite red, and oh so tasty.  Everything I have ordered has been very flavorful and never overcooked.  The portions are huge, although I often find myself finishing the whole thing.  They also have a tea menu and now serve beer and wine (although they still accept BYOWine there is a $10 corkage fee).",

    "text": "Decent pan-Asian food.  Their pad thai wasn't super authentic - the orange sauce reminded me of the color of General Tso's sauce, and it didn't have a ton of flavor - but it was a big portion for only $8.  The atmosphere is cute, they have a decent beer list and champagne cocktails (my favorite), and service was pretty good.  The only annoying thing was that they can only split a check onto 3 different credit cards regardless of how big your party is.  The four of us didn't realize that they would literally total the bill and divide it into 3 even portions, so people who order cheaper entrees or drink water get charged extra.  If you're going with multiple people, just bring cash to save the hassle.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying more of their vegetarian dishes.",

I cannot express enough my love for this restaurant! Sadly no liqour license. ='( but no matter, there is a wine store just a block up next to Rite Aid.",

It's probably the equivalent of a divy bar for restaurants - small, cozy, moody decor, variety of options for appetizers, entree and drinks. They have a separate menu for teas. It sort of has the atmosphere where hippies would feel comfortable in, except I haven't actually seen many of them there, I don't know why. Everything is priced reasonably. Swing by if you want something different from the typical Pittsburgh cuisine you can get a hold of.",

Although they themselves do not deliver, you can  have food from Spice Island delivered to you via either Wheel Deliver or Meals Delivered, I forget which one.  I recommend either ordering takeout or getting it delivered -- although the inside of the restaurant is cozy and cute, it gets really crowded sometimes, and the service can be slow depending on who your server is.  The service is the only thing keeping Spice Island from getting 5 stars from me.",

This small Thai restaurant, off the beaten path of Forbes Ave and looking pretty ghetto from the outside, is one of the coolest places for dinner in whole city. If you like tea (and I do), they have an entirely separate tea menu with a fairly large collection. Also, you can never, ever, ever, go wrong with the Ice Tea of the Day. So awesome. Almost all the food is good here, however my favorites were the singapore night noodles, the pad thai (i know), and my all-time winner, the \"chicken with string bean\" which actually comes with more than one string bean. As mentioned, this place is BYOW - and many people do. You get an eclectic crowd of college students, professors, and other academic-types mixed in with some curious locals. It's all pretty affordable too.",

The food though - like I said, average.  The pad thai is decent, as well as the Mango Pork, Lemongrass beef, and Panang curry.

    "text": "Three stars, total. I went here, once, on a date, and was more impressed with his food and our appetizer than my entree. We ordered the shrimp-and-corn fritter appetizer which was four-stars-on-yelp lovely. I was worried about it having too fishy a flavor, but the sweetness of the corn balanced the shrimp nicely. I ate the lemongrass beef, which the date had recommended, and I had it with the coconut rice. I would say the highlight of my entree was the cabbage salad, mixed slightly with the rice, than the beef itself, or the rice with the beef. The beef (two yelp stars, for a disconnect between what I thought I ordered and what was actually served) was more of a stew, with a faint lemongrass flavor and none of the other ingredients stood out. It reminded me of dinty moore, sans vegetables, in taste and texture, plus some lemongrass and seemed, taste-wise, in a disconnect from both the coconut rice (which it did not compliment) and the rice vinegar-centric cabbage. However, the date had the thai spicy fried tofu (four yelp stars), which was excellent. The chile-ginger sauce atop it complimented wonderfully with the coconut rice, and the texture of the tofu was astounding - like no other tofu I have eaten before. And, neither he or I are vegetarians nor fan of tofu, so this is a resounding recommendation of this dish. The dinner portion size of it is very large, and we took half of it home, where I ate part of it cold and part of it reheated the next day - both ways were fabulous.  Packed restaurant, but still freezing in the winter. The prices are good. But I only recommend the tofu, and the corn-and-shrimp fritters aren't so bad either. But for my overall experience, and my entree? Three stars, maybe two-point-seven-five. He even said he had eaten the lemongrass beef before and it wasn't served in this manner. New chef, I suppose?",
