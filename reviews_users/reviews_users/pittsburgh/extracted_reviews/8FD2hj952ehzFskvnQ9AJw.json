We were celebrating a birthday and the restaurant provided a gorgeous chocolate mouse confection. Attentive service. Complimentary sparkling water. Tasty crusty bread with fruity olive oil. Fine dining on Market Square. I will be back!",

    "text": "My initial thought on this new restaurant.  First I would recommend that you have all of your menu items fully stocked when opening a restaurant.  First impressions are very important.  Also, make sure your staff is fully trained. Extensive wine list but basic printing on someones home computer.  If you want to be upscale and list items at the price point you are then these details need to be attended too.  Just watch taffer. I would keep Horatio on and have him fully train your servers. He has a good following of customers at his place of employment and gives great service.  We went as a couple just to have a small bite at the bar.  Our bartender Christian, was very polite and patient.  All other bar servers were polite and attentive.  They should have name tags and always introduce themselves by name after taking an order. The caesar salad was a little bland.  The crostini was too thick more like a stale bread, hard on the mouth. They need to know how to use their cracked pepper, they were all set at ultra fine and the server struggled.  Margarita pizza had very little basil and was a bit under done, after we asked for extra basil and to make sure the crust was crispy as requested.  Overall good flavor.  It seemed odd to me that the ceasar was the same price as the margarita pizza.  It is a nice ambiance. Great location.  I think this place has a lot of potential, but for a restaurant at this price point, success is in the details.  There is a lot of competition in the city at this price point and customers will expect service and quality to match.    We will definitely go back, but hoping they iron out some of this.  Looking forward to trying other items on the menu. ...and umm the music needs a little adjustment too.",

Pay over $100 for a meal that leaves you wanting more different food because this was lot good! Some new Italian restaurant where poros used to be in market square! The fufu aside my veal scallopini had the taste of flour...which means they either added to much or did not cook it right and the sauce was also uncooked flour flavor! Add pepper add crushed red peppers eat the capers, still flour! I love overpaying for something that was not good!",

Showed up at restaurant and they couldn't find my reservation. Told them I made it through Resy they said oh we use open table now. I'm not a computer genius but if you are using two platforms to make reservations shouldn't they have the same information? Seems like basic mgmt 101. 2) They found a table for us by drafty cold glass wall near bar, had to sit with my coat wrapped around me. 3) service was scattered, waiter disappeared for long stretches. Four or five times food runners asked us if the various dishes/ drinks they had were ours (they weren't) 4) food seemed promising but was uneven. Had to ask for bread, when it finally arrived it was ice cold. appetizers were tasty. Paccheri pasta was good, halibut was over cooked and underwhelming in flavor. Excellent ricotta pear dessert.  Not sure if I'll return anytime soon until they get their issues ironed out. It's a shame, pgh needs some better Italian restaurants downtown.",

    "text": "Several weeks ago, three of my friends and I (all women) had dinner at Molinaros. We all ordered wine to start.  One woman ordered the lamb chops for $42.  There were two lamb chops on the plate.  While delicious, there was a great deal of fat on them.  The lamb chops were accompanied by one artichoke part, which was the size of my little finger.  Another woman ordered just two appetizers, which were acceptable.   I ordered the Bistecca DiManzo.  I couldn't decide between medium rare and medium and explained to Eric, the server, that I wanted it to be nicely pink.  He said that aged beef is often bloody, but suggested that I order it medium rare so that it could be returned to the kitchen if it was too rare.  When it arrived table side, I cut into it and saw that it had just a thin line of pink through it and was not at all juicy.  Eric agreed that it wasn't medium rare (or even medium to me) and agreeably returned it to the kitchen.  He returned almost immediately and reported  that the chef said that, under the brighter lighting, it was indeed medium rare.  I was disappointed, but accepted it.  The fourth woman had ordered the same steak as I did, and hers was pinker than mine, but certainly not medium rare.  At the end of dinner, Eric brought dessert for us, compliments of the chef.  I ordered decaf coffee, but this restaurant apparently doesn't serve decaf coffee.  Overall, we were very disappointed with our experience at Monlinaros and don't plan to recommend it to others and certainly will not return.",

Service was slow and our waitress disappeared for quite some time. When the food was dropped off, they didn't even pick up my salad plate. We started with a salad. The salads were $16!  Crazy price for a bowl of lettuce and some veggies. We then elected to have pasta dishes. I had to linguine with clams. There was just enough pasta to cover the bottom of the plate. If you're really hungry, this is not the dish to get. The pasta was homemade but lacked taste and was al dente plus. The portion size might have been 5 ounces. My wife had the gnocchi. She didn't even eat it. It was flavorless balls of cheese. No seasoning. We were really disappointed. At least the manager come to the table and took the gnocchi off the bull but we still spent $150. Maybe they will work out the kinks but I won't be back anytime soon. If I'm spending that kind of money I'm going to Alla Familia.",

We dined with a couple from another country, found some good but overpriced appetizers, and overpriced but poorly prepared entrees. Pasta with seafood was undercooked with pasta stuck as a clump, unopened shellfish, and shrimp head shells but no shrimp. The apparently recently reheated Lasagna was still cold in the middle. Two diners had a special with too few pieces of veal-stuffed pasta, both hungry after the meal. The lack of a dessert menu (it is recited) was pretentious and made it difficult to follow. Overall poor on food quality, but also value. Staff were attentive but too intrusive- don't interrupt conversations to ask us if we are ok. Should have gone to Piccolo Forno",

There were excessive delays in having someone come to the table initially, getting someone to help with the wine order, checking back, etc., so the meal turned into a multi-hour ordeal.  One of the guests at our table did not have silverware, and it took a long time to find someone to bring it.   One of our appetizers did not come, and it took a long time to flag the server down to report this.   This is an expensive restaurant, which had some of the worst service I have experienced in some time (and I dine out very frequently).    There is a lot of competition in the high-end Italian restaurant market in Pittsburgh, and Molinaro's needs to improve to succeed.   The food is descent, but that is only part of the equation at a high-end venue.",

Her gestures and sing-song rhythm of speech had me biting the insides of my cheeks. But, since it's a new place maybe this will improve with time.

So we sit down and...they hand us all dinner menus. We say, \"You seem to have given us the dinner menu.\" Hipster host replies, \"So...there's only one menu. We only serve one menu all day.\"  So...we say, OK, whatever. We look at the menu and every meal is over $22. A bowl of pasta with marinara? $24. We thought about walking out but just decided to suck it up. It was a beautiful day and we liked the patio ambiance. We'd try to find something brunch-like. Five minutes later a different server approaches clutching the lunch menus! \"I noticed you were all holding dinner menus so I wanted to give you lunch menus.\" The menu was more reasonably priced, with a handful of meals around $20. Why did the hipster give us the dinner menus? Either it was literally his first day of work or because every meal at dinner is roughly $6-8 more expensive than on the lunch menu. We asked the server about the discrepancy (we asked if it was his first day) and she just laughed and smiled and walked away. So we were brought in with the promise of brunch and the host tried to get us to pay for dinner. Shady, shady, shady. The food was not bad, but what's up with the scam? Are they really that desperate?",

Our waiter Giovanni knew the menu and specials cold and was a True professional. The bread served in advance was outstanding with a quality olive oil dipping side that was so on point. Fresh made in house bread! With the homemade pasta, genuine Margherita Pizza , chicken and the fresh ravioli it was a quality meal before the Pirates game. We sat outside on the square and would return again in a heartbeat.  If you want a sandwich or wings - this isn't your spot, but quality dining at a reasonable price they are an top shelf choice.  Lastly decor, bar area and from what I hear ladies bathroom were equally tasteful and well appointed.",

Service was quick,  The food was delicious but the portions of the pasta were really small, like my coworkers and I were still hungry small!  (My kids have gotten more pasta with a kids meal ordered elsewhere).  We ordered dessert (maybe that was their plan all along!) and the desserts were substantial (no one finished theirs) and delicious.    For the price, I thought the entree should have been much larger and it wasn't much better than Pizziolo Primo down the block which is more reasonable (for portions and prices) so I'll be going back there instead but if you don't mind paying a lot and eating a little, this place is quite tasty!",

There are several authentic menu items that I have only seen on menus in Italy. It is not inexpensive but is very good. They have a wonderful wine list.

Homemade pasta varieties served al dente (mine with lamb meatballs in a lemon sauce with artichoke, my friend's with mountains of clams in a basil sauce) were a visual & gastric delight. From the bread to the Italian wine to the bourbon old-fashioned with a splash of maraschino cherry liqueur, it was a continuous parade of new tastes & artful presentations. Just when we thought we'd had it all, Giovanni presented us with Limoncello that could only have been better if sipped on Lake Como! A little pricey & not for those in a hurry but if you've got the time, a unique & tantalizing dining experience awaits you served by knowledgeable & friendly staff.",

We arrived for a late dinner (9pm), and were greeted warmly from valet to the waitstaff. The bread with dipping oil was delicious, the focaccia being my favorite. We got the pizza with prosciutto and arugula on top to share. It was divine! The crust was that perfect match of crispy outside and slightly chewy inside. The toppings were enough to enhance the pizza, not overpower it. I ordered the pasta with a mix of seafood with it. Wow! The proportion of seafood to pasta is ridiculously generous. Well worth the price on the menu. My husband got the lasagna which was also delicious! The cheesecake and limoncello in the end made for a great ending to our meal. Fair warning though, everything is cooked to order so expect to dine at a leisurely pace (we were probably there for two hours). Probably a good date night or group get together if you are willing to make it a dining experience, rather than dining just to satisfy your hunger.",

I posted a glowing review about this place previously because the sauce is good and I loved a couple of  items on the appetizer menu; HOWEVER, it is very clear that whoever cooks the pasta now has no idea how to do it.  The RAVIOLI I ordered was PURE MUSH, it couldn't have been more overcooked. My husband ordered the PASTA WITH CLAM SAUCE and it was PURE MUSH as well. You could tell just by looking at it: wet, limp and stuck together.  Two other people at my table ordered another dish (a RIGATONI type pasta) and it was CRUNCHY, not al dente, crunchy.    At the very least an Italian restaurant should know how to cook pasta.   I personally will not ever order a dinner entree here again because, even previously they weren't good.  I would order appetizers and wine if I'm in the area but wouldn't go out of my way to go there. I hate to say it because I was excited about it at first but not anymore.  If you want good al dente pasta cooked right every time, opt for Mambo Italia in Sewickley instead.",

The fried mozz bordered on disgusting-- too heavy stale breading and a cold, flavorless cheese inside. Penne Vodka was lukewarm and tasted like cheap, powdered parmesan. They were out of their specialty. Wines by the glass were priced too high for their quality. It was a slow lunch day and they had a manager, a hostess, wait staff, a chef, and 5 line cooks. Seems the only want they can make a profit is to charge a lot. I think they need a strategy change here... will likely give them one more chance as every place can have an off day.",

I decided to skip perusing the menu posted and went ahead inside. I sat at a high top facing the open air outdoor seating and square. I still decided to stay when I did peruse the menu and noticed the sky rocket consumer gauging prices. Silly me. I ordered a salad and iced tea.  No protein on the salad, just a salad.   Here is what I got from servers outfitted in jackets. Listen, my beef isn't with them. A minimum of 3 servers offered me cracked pepper for my salad. My beef is iced tea that cost 4.50 delivered by a server in a fancy jacket.  Yay for bottled tea and not even freshly brewed tea for that price but, hey! It was delivered elegantly. And, then, the salad. A pretty plain salad with lots of greens and few vegetables with a pretty plain vinaigrette for 19.00, yes, 19.00. Yes, I, knowingly ordered a 19.00 salad. Protein would have cost 9.00 more. Seriously. A server asked how it was. I said bland. I received more vinaigrette.  So for a tab of 25 bucks with tax I got store bought tea, a plain salad with not so great dressing served by a server in an elegant jacket and checked on by multiple servers. No bread, either. Shall we take bets now on how long this business will remain open??? This was at lunch, folks. 25 bucks, no meat, no bread, no sides. Get out of here!  2 stars you say?  That was because the servers tried.",

Upon finding out we were all first timers, our waiter spent about 5 minutes covering the menu and giving us almost a presentation of what they offer. We loved that. I went to Molinaro with my eye on gnocchi, but when I heard lasagna bolognese as a special, I hopped on it. I've eaten more pasta in my life than i'd like to admit, and this was some of the best lasagna I've had to date. My wife tried it and immediately had FOMO, opting for the tasty (but not as good as my lasagna) lobster ravioli. One person in our group ordered halibut over risotto that she had to get different risotto brought out as her 1st attempt was runny and tasted off but she said the 2nd attempt was much better. All in all, a very nice experience from a place I wouldn't typically visit.",

It was very loud, they had someone playing a piano at the entrance, then someone singing, and different music over the speaker system. We went over to go to the bar while waiting on the table. The bartender only waited on their friends. It took over 20 minutes to get our drinks not worth it. Then finally we were seated outside, which was a relief because of how hot it was inside.  We ordered drinks while at the table the waiter was pleasant and calm compared to the shit show that was happening. Our drinks took over 30 minutes. They said the bar was backed up. Prioritize!   The pizza here was really good though, the crust was cooked it was crunchy but not burnt. Also loved the arugula on the pizza. Love it. We also got some bread for the table. Which was burnt and as hard as a rock.  We waited over 2 hours for our entrees and should be considered lucky because most tables waited alot longer than us. The table behind of us were told they ran out of food. Inside you could see the waiters scrambling and taking whatever food was up. It was a cluster fuck. #getittogether.  The food was nothing special, the person who ordered the Pollo, that was amazing, it was so tender and juicy. The filet was also a favorite at our table, nicely rendered and cooked perfectly. However , the pasta was bland.  I had the sea bass, which was small but probably because they told me it was the last one. The flavor was good, nice smokey and tomato flavor, the skin was not crispy tho but soggy.  Overall, I would not go back. I understand the soft opening aspect but that was a cluster fuck. Also instead of tending to your friends, tend to the guests. Hire more bartenders. Plus communication between front of the house and kitchen is key.",

The negroni was sweet and potent whereas most of the time people make it much more bitter. The calamari is lightly breaded which is a plus for the waistline and it's soft and juicy without a single chewy bite in sight. They garnish it with lemon which I put on the calamari because I love the tartness and the accompanying marinara is a little acidic but a wonderful consistency. The surrounding area on this Friday afternoon was bustling which is great for my people watching addiction and the staff is so attentive, kind and interested in their patrons. If I lived in Pittsburgh this would be a staple for my biweekly self dates.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch with a party of 5 others. The first thing I noticed was that the menu was very over priced. Expect to pay more around higher end dinner prices just for lunch. I ordered the Caesar salad ($19) and had ahi tuna ($9) added to it. The dressing on the salad was very bland and I could barely taste it. However, the tuna was expertly cooked and seasoned. A few of the other people in the group ordered pasta dishes. All remarked it was just so so and not that great and that it just seemed almost like ordering an average spaghetti meal when they ordered the tagliolini pomodoro ($18). The service was excellent and very attentive and this could be a great place if there are some adjustments made to the menu and costs.",

I will give another shot, but for the price, it's not a whole lot of an upgrade over Il Piz.",

    "text": "Dinner at Molinaro last night was a pleasant experience, but the restaurant is hard to review. First, it was not full on a Friday night only a month after it's highly anticipated opening. Why? The space is attractive but little changed from the prior restaurant, Poros. It's upscale Italian in all regards, with a limited menu. The menu is a little strange in that it includes pizza and a couple of $60+ entres. The $60 items, a veal dish and a whole Dover sole (which is listed as 'market priced', so you have to ask), seem out of place on this menu and in Pittsburgh. We each had the veal scaloppini, which was very good. There were several other normally priced entres, particularly the pastas, which I would like to try. We ordered a side of mushroom risotto which was severely undercooked and consequently sent back. There was an unusually good free bread service. We finished with an excellent lemon cake, which was a complementary birthday surprise. Service was very good. I was disappointed in the wine selections, as there were no reasonably priced California Chardonnays, the least expensive one being a $66 Paul Hobbs. So, I'd like to return, and maybe I will, but I'm not sure it's worth the big investment. Last night's dinner, consisting of two cocktails, a bottle of Chardonnay, and two small veal entres (the risotto was returned and desert was comped) was north of $200 with tip. Was it that good?",

Bar was  much less busy than we anticipated and my husband and I sat down and each ordered a bourbon/rocks drink and a glass of ice water and requested a menu.  Bourbons were served but no water and no menu.  For 45 minutes, while there were no more than 5 other bar customers and 2 bartenders, we were unable to catch the attention of either bartender to remind them of the water or the menu requested.  They were much too busy chatting with other staff--staff that were hanging around, not servers waiting for their drinks for their tables.    At some point during the frustration of being ignored, we decided to finish our drinks and look for another dinner option.  Both drinks were empty for approx 10 minutes and still no attention from either bartender.  At that point we were going to leave cash that we estimated would cover the tab and stood up to put on our coats when Connor, the bartender who poured our drinks,  finally met my eye and I was able to request the check.",

Looking around it was like the Jersey Shore cast blew up all over the place. Slicked up guidos and mouthy bimbettes were dressed in their best church and/or night club attire and were staring people down.  I sat down and was met with cackling patrons staring at me and making fun of their neighbors and coworkers. My waiter was kind of loud and slightly frightened me.  I ordered the meatball appetizer and garlic bread. The garlic bread was good and garlicky and big. The meatballs were so-so and needed Italian seasoning.   All in all this a nice upscale expensive Italian restaurant with a nice bar and private party room downstairs where Italian peoples go to see and be seen and scream.",

My visit was me and a friend, dinner before theatre.  We sat down at 6 p.m. and told the waiter we had an 8 pm show. The service was very slow and at 7:30 we opted out of desert and had to leave.   I had the porcetta and my companion had a chicken dish.  Both dishes were plentiful for the amount of food but both lacked any wow factor in taste.  The porcetta was sliced pork on a hard crusted bread served with roasted potatoes and broccolirob.  I was expecting flavor, but was disappointed.  It was just plain, plain, plain.  Same for the chicken.    Given the fact that service was soo slow and the dished lacked any 'wow' I am giving it 3 stars.  The stars are for interior design, but shouldn't a restaurant want great food over pretty interior?  I won't be back and wouldn't recommend it to friends.  Total cost without tip for two, with only one alcohol beverage was $89.",

The stuffed pepper appetizer, we all agreed was one of the best we have had. I wish the gnocchis were a little more al dente but they were still good. Next time,  I would try the vodka sauce. My husband really liked his pizza but thought the crust could have been a little more crispy.    Overall, this place was a great find and we all agreed we would come again. Our service was excellent as well.  Eric was the best waiter we have had in a while .  Just a tip, we ended up parking in a garage for $10 but later found out they do have valet for the same price.",

    "text": "Came here for the \"Once a Month\" event that was being held on Saturday night. The venue is very nice! The windows were open, so they had the inside/outside flow going on. The ambiance inside is very nice with wooden tables and tons of candles with a low lighting. Since I was there for a special event and it was later in the night, I only got drinks, and this is where I had a not-so-great experience. I ordered a Tito's double with cranberry, and the bartender tells me that it'll be $23. The cup was TINY and even if there were all vodka in the cup (there wasn't...the drink was quite pink from plenty of cranberry juice lol) $23 is ALOT. But I'm not from Pittsburgh and neither have I ever been here so I'm thinking \"ok, maybe this place is just like that\". When I sat down, a friend had a Captain Morgan double AND a beer, and her total was $18. I said ohh no way. So I go and find my bartender and tell her what my friend got and what the price was. Her response: \"Well do you have her receipt?\" as in \"well tf do you want me to do about it\" because clearly, I don't have another person's receipt; that's just stupid lol. So I just stared back at her because that was rude, and she knew it was. So then she says (with attitude of course) \"Well what do you want? Another drink?\" Me: \"Yes that'll work.\" Her: (more attitude) \"Well then what did you have? How am I supposed to remember.\" So, I told her and she brought the other weak drink, sigh.  What I can say is that the flat breads looked and smelled good (though my hunch is that they are overpriced as well). If I wouldn't have experienced that with the drink I'd totally reccomend the place, especially during nighttime hours, because it's very nice and in a cute area. Maybe next time I'm in Pittsburgh I'll visit if there's an event going on, but I will definitely be pregaming first",

    "text": "What a lovely restaurant and in a great location. Loved the view of the ice rink from the window adjacent to our table. It was very romantic. The service was exceptional and every single employee was so friendly.  The food is southern Italian from a chef that has lived and traveled back to cook authentic meals. We started off with drinks. The mule has mint in it so it almost tasted more like a mojito. It was refreshing.  We tried the meatballs and also the peppers. Both were great. The bread basket had different options with an oil dip. I had the ricotta gnocchi and my husband had a veal pasta that had been slow cooked. Both were great but his was better. It has so much flavor and the veal almost melted in your mouth.  We were stuffed and had no room for dessert. Would definitely recommend for a nice dinner.",

The male bartender was very nice, attentive and very accommodating. They had some cheap appetizers and drinks.   My friend got the supposed margarita pizza and it had no cheese which was weird. I got the supposed salami pizza that barely had any salami on it and tasted horrible. The crust was good but the rest was terrible. My other friend really enjoyed her gnocchi. We did enjoy the drinks.   I won't be back.",

I forget the name of the dish but it was a seafood pasta and the pasta was brought in from Italy since it was a specially made item. Yummo!   The place is elegant and classy. Check them out!",

    "text": "I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars. The food was delicious and the entire restaurant was beautiful. The staff was very accommodating and knowledgeable of the dishes.   The pasta was great and everything had flavor, beautiful presentation and texture. The soup was the best part of my meal hands down; it was a special for the night I visited. The chestnut puree was delightful, sweet and buttery. The handmade raviolis with clam inside were so wonderful. I should've ordered another plate and call that my dinner. It was phenomenal. Not any of the clams that were in both seafood dishes I ordered were sandy- I was honestly super impressed.   The pizzas were not my favorite but that's a matter preference. They were Neapolitan style pizza which require you to eat the pizza with a fork. I was not a fan of all the toppings on the dough however, all of it was really good quality toppings.   The bread was wonderful however, I wish there was butter to spread on the bread and not just olive oil. I think the bread and desserts, which are made by their special pastry chef were one of the highlights of the meal. Presentation was great for everything however, the taste was even better.   My only qualm about dining here was the grilled octopus dish, could've been better. The octopus was a little tough and seemed like it wasn't cooked all the way. It was even difficult cutting it! Besides that, this restaurant is highly recommended. The atmosphere is beautiful and I appreciate how the restrooms are downstairs. The journey to them is wonderful, you get to see all the beauty and detail that goes into the restaurant.",

Chicken Caprese was good.  Papparadelle Boscaiola was under cooked and cream sauce was a bit gloppy.  Their version of papparadelle was too thick which probably contributed to it being cooked way less than al dente.  Mark-up on wine is pretty pricey.  Our server was very good.",

We discussed wines, he asked about our meal and service, and offered suggestions on things to do while visiting his city.  Pure class.",
