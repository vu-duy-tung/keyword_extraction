    "text": "Almost missed this place. Cruising in circles looking for something affordable to eat yet with outdoor seating, but alas closing time is 8 pm and we were there at 7:55 pm... Prize would have been OK, menu too, so we went in and asked if they could give us slices to go. But instead they asked us where we would like to sit and so it turned out they didn't realize they had the mini time on their sign, sending people to the next door place, allegedly closed.  We were so glad! I checked some other reviews of this place, and as of the food, here is the thing: if you know North Italian home cooking, this is it. Like that. It is not like in hipster three Michelin star restaurants, and, by the way, if it was and then the same location, the every-day-Joe-Yelp-crowd would not be sitting there, way too expensive. But what do I know who is really sitting where? What I am saying is: if you want food that was cooked by a human being with an Italian taste this is an excellent place to go to. And the staff is wonderful, yes, VERY personable, and I am someone I rather sit some nice place eat some good food and talk to a real human being than get served some elegant painting of a dish by a robot or a person who learned a chique greeting phrase by heart. But that is me and you need to think if that is what you're after. By the way, besides the delicious and well-sized pizza, the homemade Tiramisu is to die for. And: apparently you can bring your own booze, please confirm if that is a constant offer. (Another tip: if you love soccer, talk to Sergio! You will make a friend. Cool, lovely people!)",

    "text": "This is the place to get a great slice of sicilian pizza.   My co-workers and I agree that this is one of the best sicilian slices in the city. Crispy and airy crust make the enormous slices not too heavy and they hold a lot of toppings really well. Plus their sauce and topping choices really round out this pizza. Their regular NY style slices are decent, but I would definitely go for the sicilian.   The hoagies are all pretty good too, as a good Italian place should do. Not the most veg-friendly place. Other than the toppings on the pizza, they serve a side salad, which is mostly iceberg lettuce, and they put deli ham on the salad, which in my opinion is completely unnecessary. Seems like they are just serving to the over meaty and under-vegged Pittsburgh eaters (who whould be confronted with more good veggie dishes more often). But their homemade Italian dressing is great.   Service is great here. It's family run and the Grandmother and Mother waitress, always with a smile and friendly banter. Seems like Papa and son are in the kitchen serving up the food. Plus there is outside seating which is often available even on crowded days in the square.   Looks can be deceiving, because I don't think I would have ever checked this place out by just looking at it from the outside, or inside for that matter. A good recommendation from a friend got me here, so hopefully it works for you too.",

I wasn't please with the sausage because it was essentially like in small bits and amounts, but the thin crust was baked just right and the cheese was good as well.  There were no napkins and too much grease on the pizza. No bathroom in site either. I wanted to wash my hands.   Best food I had in Pittsburgh besides the William Penn Omni Terrace Room.

The people here were VERY friendly and nice but to me they were pretty slow. I ordered stuffed shells and my friend ordered a slice of pizza. Perhaps we should have preordered first but we didn't. I was told my food would take about 13 minutes to make but instead it took about 15-20 minutes - the place wasn't even busy. Most places take 13-15 minutes for stuff shell orders. I had to leave and come back. When I finally got my food there was NO CHEESE on it. Well no mozzarella or anything like expected. Instead it was sprinkled with a thin layer of parmesan cheese. The tomato sauce was some sort of thick tomato paste and the dish itself had no LIFE to it, no CHEESE to it, nothing. It was so disgusting to eat I threw half of it away. For roughly $13, it was a waste of money and my lunch break. Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, I dunno but I haven't been back since.",

    "text": "The waitress is RACIST. Four of my friends (3 lighter complexion Latin Americans and 1 Namibian) came for lunch. We found a table outside and since we didn't know how the serving worked, one of us (white, Latin American) stayed at the table while the rest went inside and order. As we walked in, I stayed away from the other two because I was on my cellphone. The waitress asked me politely to let her through, I apologized for being in her way and stepped aside - we smiled at each other. When I was in line, my Namibian (the only black one in the group) friend asked the cashier if the food was brought to our table outside or if we should wait, he told her that she (the client) was supposed to wait inside to take her order herself. I ordered and joined them while we waited. As we (along with my Namibian friend) sat down inside the restaurant, we realized the waitress was in fact serving everyone else. I tried to ask her if she could bring our food to our table like everyone else, that's when she started ignoring me. It took three attempts of calling her attention and other clients to notice she was walking past us, for her to address me. I asked her if she could serve our food in our table outside, she started being impolite and told me we had to wait for it ourselves. I noticed another African American woman was waiting for takeout and the cashier brought her food instead of the waitress. Ironically, the waiter went outside and actually asked our other friend for her order. I had enough, went up to the cashier to ask them to bring our food outside like everybody else's. The cashier and cook did step up after this and brought it themselves and served us. As we sat outside she continued to serve (bring drinks, utensils, food, and napkins) to the other 3 (all white) tables around us, walking past us as if we just weren't there. The pizza after this tasted bitter in my mouth.   In the pictures you can see her serving others around, she didn't even notice we took pictures of her. Her attitude towards others was polite and even sweet, I really can't believe that the reason she was impolite to us and wouldn't serve another African American client is just a coincidence.",

    "text": "I stopped by La Gondola for a quick dinner about two weeks ago before seeing a show in the Cultural District.  I was curious as to how it would compare to the other nearby slice shop, Cafe Milano, which left me underwhelmed.  Ultimately, my assessment of La Gondola ended up being similar, but at least the owner was friendly and didn't aggressively upsell me.  To get an idea of what their pizza is like, I ordered two slices--one of the thick crust Sicilian, and one of the thin crust regular ($2.50 each, I believe).  Additionally, I ordered a small side salad ($3.50).  The salad, while not anything too special, was enjoyable, esp. given the price--I especially enjoyed the generous topping of pizza cheese.  As for the slices, I could tell they were made fresh, based on the amount of time that they took to come out and seeing the owner ladling sauce on them before they went into the oven.  I have to agree with Chip's assessment here--they struck me as fairly average in quality.  While there was nothing wrong with them, per se, they just weren't very memorable.  I can't speak for the toppings, since both of my slices were plain (the thought of ordering a topping occurred to me too late), but a good pizza stands on its own.  While I guess $2.50 is relatively inexpensive downtown (esp. in Market Square, where the rent must be sky high), it's more than I'm used to paying for slices.  On a positive note, the owner was very friendly, as I mentioned--there's always something to be said for service with a smile.  On the flip side, however, the furniture is looking pretty run down, with large visible tears in the upholstery, and could definitely use an overhaul.  Overall, not bad, but also probably not good enough to make me seek it out again, given the competitive downtown dining scene.  3.5 stars.",

Nothing special about the sauce or cheese - just a bland soft slice.  I see a lot of good reviews, but really don't understand that.",

    "text": "I've eaten here at La Gondola's before and I can attest that the baked sandwiches are da bomb.  I wasn't all too hungry for lunch today but felt that I needed to get out and have something so I decided on a slice of pizza.   The atmosphere is what you would expect from a Pittsburgh Italian family owned pizzeria. Clean yet a little cramped; friendly but not overly so; service not exactly slow but for a simple slice of pizza it wasn't \"freakishly fast\" either. The two waitresses and the two behind the counter doing the cooking seem to be having a good time.  My slice of pizza came and it looked so yummy. The crust was perfectly done and it had cheese artfully oozing over the pepperoni. Esthetically beautiful. Unfortunately when I bit into it, the taste was just average. It wasn't bad, the crust held up just fine but the sauce was lacking \"oomph\"... that zest that you look for when eating pizza (at least it's what I look for).   Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad slice of pizza, just average. Average in taste, average in size, even average in temperature. I wouldn't go out of my way for a slice of pizza here. But I wouldn't put up a fuss if I was with a group and they wanted to go. But I'd probably opt for one of their tasty sandwiches or maybe try one of the pasta dishes over the pizza.",

    "text": "For 35 years, La Gondola has sat in an obscure corner of Market Square, unaffected by the upheaval and renewal this area of Downtown Pittsburgh has experienced, looking on quietly as trendy restaurants and fast food franchises have sprouted and withered away. The other night, prior to the Alice In Chains concert at The Benedum, I made it a point to visit, to become acquainted with what I had been missing for far too many sunsets.   What I was missing was an amply filled half-hoagie that stung with a piquant Italian dressing, refreshed with crisp, juicy vegetables, and comforted with toasty bread and molten cheese.   What I was missing was a pizza that possesses a paradox of a crust that is luxuriously soft yet sturdy and somewhat crunchy. Rounding it out is a scrumptious, unctuous cheese that partially coats the toppings (mine was pepperoni) like white lace, and a savory, carefully prepared sauce crafted by a master.  That master is La Gondola's soft-spoken, middle-aged owner Sergio who happened to have a Fleetwood Mac concert on the television when I arrived. With him I had a wonderful conversation that touched on the subjects of pizza, food in general, classic rock, Pittsburgh, and life itself. I'd been missing that also.   \"You know,\" he told me, pointing his finger at the lights above, \"People get leery of comin' in. We have people peek in, the same people, day in day out, but they won't come in. But when they finally do, they end up lovin' our food. All of it's homemade, from scratch. When you make stuff from scratch or anything from the bottom up, you're givin' your heart and soul as well.\"   \"Like that guy, he's pretty damn good, I'll tell you what,\" Sergio proclaimed while halfway air-guitaring as Lindsey Buckingham performed a solo.  La Gondola is miles and miles more than pretty good, its staying power fueled by a sense of tradition and economy. Ignore the hype of their next door neighbor Winghart's and give the old-school a chance to charm your jaded palate.",

I have gotten the small spinach white pizza twice now. It is my regular order now and delicious twice in a row. I also got the small chef salad this time. Mainly cheese and I probably won't be getting that again, but the homemade dressing is very tasty.   They have a very large menu including desserts.

I called La Gondola, a place we've walked by hundreds of times but never paid attention to, and spoke to Christine. I asked about a couple of options, and she was very helpful and patient.  And the pizza? Excellent. Truly outstanding. First, it was hot when Christine (same lady) arrived with it. I love that, and it's rare. It smelled incredible, and tasted delicious. It was perfectly seasoned, not greasy, and the crust was perfect - crisp with good chew. The garlic bread, a splurge, surprised us with some oregano and other flavors. Not a bland, cheesy, soggy mess like we've had elsewhere.   We're moving outside of their delivery area, but we'll be back, for lunch or even a fun jump in the car, headed out for fantastic pizza.  Thank you to Sergio and Christine for a fabulous end to a hectic moving day!",

I ordered a half margherita and half mushrooms and pepperoni. It was so good.

The pizza is hot and the crust has a crisp to it but its not hard.   The place is tight so if you plan on eating in a large group would likely need to be split up into groups of 4 or less.   The place is old school in how it is ran. there are a lot of signs that may come off stern. For example there are signs on the soda machine stating no free refills. There are signs saying if you order a order to go then you must leave their establishment to eat your order. I've also verbally heard this rule enforced.  I've never had any issues with the rules. I forgo some pleasantries to get the slice that I want.   Overall - 4 stars is a fair score.",

There are other bottles of soda plus a fountain that is NOT self serve and there are no refills as the sign taped to the machine indicates. Ok got. I had a regular slice and grape soda sat myself outside  pizza was nice and hot!  its ok pizza its not a super thin crust I was hoping for but it is decent pizza.

I sat down at a smaller table in the front by the register since it was very crowded during lunch. When the waitress noticed that I was sitting with the pizza box and eating she began to whisper under her breath. She then rudely asked me if I wanted grated cheese by shaking it in front of my face. Next, she came back to the table and said since I was eating in that I should use a plate and started to remove my pizza from the box. That was when she reprimanded me for sitting at the front table during a busy time. I started to nervously laugh and she began whispering to one of the people behind the counter about how wrong I had been for sitting at that table in the first place. I wouldn't avoid this place at all costs.",

Since I'm originally from a small town, it gives me a strong dose of nostalgia. The staff is very friendly and committed to making the food well; it's not the fanciest place, but if you want a large and reasonably priced slice, regular or Sicilian,  this place is just terrific.",

The space is out-dated with ripped leather booths, dominated by shades of brown and orange. Totally screamed old pizza place.   We ordered a large (8 slices) to split between four people. While the pizza was large, the taste was quite average. I didn't find anything special in the flavors and the dough definitely wasn't my favorite. The dough didn't seem to be very yeasty or chewy, which is usually how I like it.   La Gondola might be a better stop for their sandwiches, but the pizza is average. There are other places in town that I would choose over this one.",

    "text": "I was in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago, staying nearby La Gondola. How impressed I was in general. The city was a delight. The little square in which La Gondola Pizzeria is located was so nice to relax in the afternoon sun.   I had noticed La Gondola while getting my Starbucks coffee. It was very unassuming in decor. Just a small, very retro little place. No one was there, but I saw two older Italian men working in the lit kitchen. I had a hunch this would be an authentic Italian Restaurant, versus the chains.  The first evening I stopped in and ordered the lasagna to go. Wow. I could not stop myself from eating it all. And it was a large portion. It reminded me of the cooking of an Italian family I stayed with when very young. Every day for the rest of the week, I stopped in for pizza, which was equally good.   Don't let the minimal decorum, or that no one is there, dissuade you from trying it. Get a to-go order. It is fantastic.",
