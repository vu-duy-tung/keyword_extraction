For me, four stars is max for this type of establishment for the simple reason that no one has license to create anything truly unique...  However!  The Chilean Sea Bass Marinated in Oolong Tea is freakin' fantastic!  10+  Now - everyone was happy with their meals and let me tell you it was a ridiculously busy night, servers were threading their way through patrons waiting to be seated and our service was very good.  I've been to PFC Vegas and PFC NYC - our Homestead PFC definitely beats them both.  So many great little places to try in the 'Burgh, but I wouldn't resist going back to this particular PFC.",

Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try.   We came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food.",

Pei Wei is Chang's super convenient and cost friendly fast casual eatery that started infiltrating the Detroit market in 2007. Subsequently, that was the last time I stepped into a PF Changs until I recently moved back to Pittsburgh. Going from a Pei Wei to a PF Chang's is like watching paint dry or sitting in rush hour traffic or attending a WNBA game; it's so methodical and time consuming.  On our last visit to this location we were accidentally sat in a section in which the server had been cut from his/her shift. By the time we flagged down a server and everything was sorted out, we could have been halfway through our meals at Pei Wei.  Add in the wait time for a table, the sauces shtick, and presentation of the check and my head's about to explode. Chang's is more paced for retires and people on dates, not my lifestyle. I get it, it's a me problem.  With that said, the staff is very nice and helpful at this location (star).  I can get a beer or alcoholic beverage while I wait (something that's not an option at Pei Wei) (star). Plymouth Gin is stocked behind the bar - that's a chain first! (star). I found a dish I love not available at Pei Wei - Salt and Pepper Prawns (star).   So until I get sick of the Prawns or a Pei Wei opens in the Pittsburgh market, I'll continue to go to this location.",

    "text": "Let's put the food aside here for a moment.  Let's talk about customer service for a moment.  Earlier this week, I had the misfortune of dining at the Waterfront P.F. Changs.  It was bitter cold outside. Their food is usually good, so my husband and I ducked in to get a bite before we went to the movies.  We were seated and we quickly ordered because we wanted to make our show time.  I didn't notice it at first, but I soon realized that it was cold in the restaurant. I asked about the heat and I was told that there was no heat - that it had broken earlier that day.  I asked our server why they hadn't mentioned this when we came in.  Well, I already know the answer to that - we would have turned around a gone somewhere else.  Then the manager came over and apologized.  I mentioned to him that it might have been nice to be warned about the heat (as I sat there in my coat).  He seemed to agree with me, but still allowed at least another 20 people enter the restaurant without saying a word to them. Not one word. Oh, he did offer me some dessert. That's what they usually do when someone has f**ked up.  In this case it didn't matter.  I quickly ate and left to make my movie.  This is the second bad experience I've had at this particular location.  Last time I was there, the floor was pretty dirty which always makes me nervous.  What does the kitchen look like?  I'm not against P.F. Chang's because it is a chain I have gone to in other states and have always liked the food.  This location needs to get their act together.",

Where I think the restaurant really underwhelms is the soups and salads, I know it isn't the focus of the restaurant but the lunch sides that precede the lunch entrees are just bad.

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.  So... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.  I started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \"pork\"-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.  Next came my \"lunch-portion\" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more).   At the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's.   On my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.  Glaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.  I've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \"lunch-portion\" cost was $9.95.  At The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.  The service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs.",

She was very nice, and provided us with the exact amount of condiments we listed on the online order form. They're usually stingy with the chili and hot mustard sauces! She also gave us a couple other sauces to try (not sure which ones), but these were very good.   The food here is always in point.

They were spotting the tab, and the better half had medication to take, so a hasty decision to go to PF Chang's was made, and I came to revile it was much as any other discerning diner.   To start, the service was adequate, and the decor was as eye-catchingly grand as a backdrop to any scene from the video game Mortal Kombat. The food, however, was one fatality after another.   Our appetizer consisted of Chang's signature Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and they might as well have been globs of Fancy Feast portioned out into leaves of iceberg lactuca sativa, and sweet this sativa was not...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D76iX4dpsoho&s=87a4722d5be22d57d1a03ae85a84f21feccebe0751058820751b8337298ecb19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=76iX...</a>  I decided to order a dish that moderately intrigued me from their seasonal menu: The Chino-Latino Pineapple Pork. I thought I'd be in for some funkadelic fusion here considering its border-blurring nature and vibrant colors, but unfortunately, the pork cubes were underseasoned and somewhat dry, the tart salsa that topped it trying valiantly to liven it up, the pineapple chunks screaming for more backup from the proteins only to retreat due to the overwhelming blandness.   Dessert was a big beautiful nothing called The Great Wall of Chocolate, and damn did it ever hit the wall sans an airbag...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Da1ie7QHklpU&s=28611ad02dc958a74e74d2117bf2d0d37757b371966c9a78441059ea8e28c20b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=a1ie...</a>  6 layers of chocolate boredom, I don't even recall finishing it.   PF Chang's fails to entice not due to an adherence to the increasingly vague idea of \"authenticity\" but rather because their food is what generally happens (I do like some chains and will defend them at times) when Corporate Amerika gets its hands on any cuisine.   I often see PF Chang's \"materials\" in the supermarket freezer sections. If that isn't indicative of banality...",

    "text": "I've always liked PF Chang's and, generally speaking, this location is pretty good. I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely personable and fast.  The food is typical PF Chang's: delicious. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of \"Chinese\" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entrees and have never been disappointed.  I've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones.  The only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more. If you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. I've yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait. PF Chang's, included.",

    "text": "Decent/friendly service.  Slow kitchen (on a slow night with less than 1/4 filled).  Uneven food preparation.  While the food could be very good, the place has very uneven quality in every aspect of the restaurant.  We had a large dinner (over 5 people and over $250 in total bill), and here's our impression.  1) Food - Appetizers were very good, Chicken Lettuce Wrap, great as usual.  Lobster/Shrimp Taco excellent.  Sushi was lackluster across the board, almost not worth ordering - you might get better ones off a buffet assembly line.  The soups were uneven - Wonton soup excellent.  Hot n Sour soup is dense and salty, and again, worse than a standard $5 Chinese restaurant buffet line.  Main Entree is uneven as well - not particularly flavorful.  The new entrees are hit and miss.  Lamb is good and tender, though tasted nothing like lamb (just beef-flavor, the sauce is very heavy).  But the Chilean Sea Bass (Hong Kong style), one of the most expensive item on the menu, is severely undercooked - we should have sent it back but did not (our fault).  This is how under-cooked it is - we tried to cut it with a knife, and cannot because the middle was NOT cooked.  And Sea Bass is so flaky and it's supposed to fall apart at the touch of a fork.  2) Service - Server is friendly, and accommodating to different requests.  Fresh plates are brought during change of courses.  On the other hand, the restaurant, though encouraging \"family style\" serving, does not quite know how to serve food in family style.  There are extended wait time between appetizer, to soup, to sushi, to entrees.  Family style would require items to be brought up as each is ready, rather than having guests wait for extended time and then have everything arrive at the same time.  For a place that was less than 1/4 seated, there was far too much wait time (20 min) between appetizer and just soup, and again extended wait between sushi and hot entrees.  By the time the main courses arrived, it was almost anti-climatic and people were pretty much full/tired.  It was not clear whose job it was to clear off the \"empty\" plates when food is eaten, a number of times it was piled up on the corners of a small table - again, at far cheaper buffet lines, these plates would have been cleared much, much sooner.  Over the last decade, our P.F. Chang experience have gone from excitement to just a periodic visit with out-of-town guests - and the uneven food and service experience is not likely to encourage many re-visits.",

Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick.   The service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.    I think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation.",

    "text": "Any place that accommodates with a special dietary menu for a little known disease gets five stars from me.  P.F. Chang's has a dedicated Gluten-Free Menu for those of us who suffer from celiac disease.  They also make sure to clean down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid cross-contamination.  I don't know many other restaurants that go this far.  Aside from the menu preference, I enjoy my overall experience every time.  Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  Don't expect this to be at all like that.  It's not a Buffet.  They don't sell \"General Tso's\" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended for those looking for something similar, it's my personal favorite) or other signature foods that you may expect.  They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not sure.  They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.    The prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well worth it.  Portions are excellent and the taste is great.  I've yet to have one complaint and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.  The only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  It's also very dark because of their lighting.  However, I think it sets the atmosphere.  It can be a romantic place or a casual place, I've been there for both.",

My girlfriend got an appetizer of the edamame and the fried green beans the edamame was very Bland and needed seasoning the green beans were not spectacular although she did say that she enjoyed the sauce. for entrees I had the sweet and sour chicken I have had sweet and sour chicken from several other Chinese restaurants including take out and I was very displeased with the sauce and the poportion I've had better for cheaper. My girlfriend had the chicken fried rice which was fine but it's also a very easy dish overall we rated this restaurant with one star because we did not even care to stay for dessert even though the desert did look appetizing.

Here in Pittsburgh, it's the only Chinese place I've found that combines genuinely good service with quality food.  Not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in LA's top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here.  The Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles.  Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too.  Their fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don't quite like.  Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do.  Portions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came.  The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees.  If you live in LA, forget P F Chang's.  If you live in NYC, I'm sure there are a dozen better places on a single block.  But here in Pittsburgh, it's just about the best place around.",

    "text": "Sadly I've been here a few times because it's a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend's parents come down to visit. There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \"alright\" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.  The food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.  Last time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.  Obviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.",

    "text": "This was our second trip to P.F. Chang's and it will probably be our last. Both times we had problems with rice. I guess rice isn't their strong point. This isn't too hot for a Chinese restaurant.  We ordered some spring rolls and dumplings for apps. The dumplings were great, the best part of the meal, honestly. But at $3.25 for 3, they're quite expensive for literally, one bite. They were quite good, though. Minced pork, shrimp and water chestnuts in a deliciously chewy translucent wonton wrapper. Very tasty.  We also got the spring rolls. They were pretty boring and dripping with oil. It looks like the cook just took them out of the fryer and sat them in a pile of other fried things, soaking up the oil.  When they serve the apps, they give you a plethora of dipping sauces...dumpling sauce, sambal (hot sauce), hot mustard plus sesame oil, soy sauce and vinegar. The spring rolls also came with a sweet and sour sauce. I like sauces, so this was a plus. The bottle with the sesame oil was coated in the oil, though. So your hands got all greasy every time you used it. They probably should have wiped down the bottle after refilling it.  For our entrees, we got the pork lo mein and almond chicken. The almond chicken was tasty. It had plenty of veggies in it, almonds and cashews and lots of white meat chicken. The lo mein was okay, but they used speghetti instead of lo mein...and it was overcooked.  Remember how I said they had problems with the rice? The last time we came here, we ordered several dishes. After everything was on the table, our waiter disappered for about fifteen minutes. He had never brought us our rice. So we sat and ate everything, sans rice, until he came back to check on us. I told him everything was very nice....we just had no rice to eat our meals with. He said \"Oh you wanted rice?\"  Of course we wanted rice, thats why we came to a Chinese restaurant. We got the rest of our food boxed up and the waiter didn't give us a container of rice. What's the deal with the rice?  Our visit the other day...we ended up getting crunchy rice. We asked for another serving of rice and all they did was get the same crunchy stuff from the same rice cooker. Cooking rice isn't rocket science and a Chinese restaurant should be able to get it right.   My biggest complaint is the price. The entrees are roughly twice what they would be from pretty much any Chinese joint in the city. Our meal the other day for 2 small apps and 2 entrees was $35. We could have easily gotten twice as much food as a normal Chinese restaurant. And honestly, the quality would have been better. I filled out a survey from the receipt and received a reply from their manager the next day. He apologized and offered me a free appetizer. Unfortunately, we won't be coming back.",

We ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did.  She spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took 3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty. We ordered appetizers and they never came out.  She actually brought us our check and we never got our food. By the way we were the only people at the bar.  Finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed. We payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready. We finally got seated by the windows. Do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. We ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks. After our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. Nothing was comped and no manager was available. This PF Changs needs new management!! We will never return. I will give it 2 stars because the food was great, but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders. Steer clear until changes are made. It's not worth the headache.",

    "text": "My wife and I came here a few years ago and you couldn't get in the door because of the line. This was the hottest new place on the restaurant scene and everyone wanted to try it. Fast forward to present day and you'd never believe that was ever the case. Chang's is poorly set up as one large open room that's rather noisy. Food came out quickly but was not as good as the Chinese take out we get from sesame inn. Spicy chicken was neither spicy nor very flavorful and had a mass-produced feel to it. Took half home to eat the next day but ended up throwing it out a few days later. Normally one of the great thing about getting Chinese is looking forward to the leftovers the next day!   Another minus was noticing how dirty the floor was on the way back to the bathroom. I don't expect a place to be immaculate in the middle of dinner service but this looked like the mcdonalds on Smithfield downtown. The one bright spot was our waitress was very good and kept our water glasses filled. We just came from kennywood so we went through quite a few fill ups during our time there. Short of this, I'd probably give Changs two stars. Probably last time I'll stop in here unless I can't get in to any restaurants in the area and need a place I know won't be too busy.",

    "text": "REDO!  I went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.    My issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.    My resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.  So we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:  Coca Cola Iced Tea Pan fried pork dumplings Sesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup Changs chicken with white rice  Our drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.  My egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.  Our lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.    I just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better.",

    "text": "My indo-Chinese friend and I came here after our parents heard about this \"upscale Chinese chain\" bringing good Chinese food with good ambiance to the masses, and they kept bugging us to tell them about it.   We ordered the lettuce wraps, dan-dan mien, and roasted duck.  Two things stood out.  When the waiter brought out our appetizer, he asked us if we liked our food mild or spicy. We said spicy, thinking that he was referring to our dan-dan mien. Before we could react, he mixed the appetizer's sauce with mustard and some other crap. Both of us sat there dumbfounded that he had ruined what looked like a perfectly good sauce.   The duck also left us speechless. When we ordered it, the waiter warned us that duck could be an oily dish. We said that's fine by us (while snickering inside as we wondered what could be better than duck fat). What we got was the most amazingly fat-free duck. It's amazing cause the bird has ALOT of fat. Of course the lack of duck fat (or as Alton Brown calls it, \"liquid love\") meant that it was the worst, most tasteless and dry duck we'd ever had. It really took some hard work to make duck taste bad. You could leave duck unseasoned, overcook it til it's dry and tough; but give us some some salt and the rendered duck fat to drizzle on top and we'd still say it tastes good.   Needless to say, we didn't say nice things about PF Chang's to our parents.  Despite how shockingly bad the duck was, I'll give 2 stars since the dan-dan noodles and lettuce wraps were average, and it's clean (a trait that's not to be overlooked in a Chinese place, or a place that poses as a Chinese place).   As a sidenote, I feel a little sorry for the waiter. He looked awkward while explaining to us how Chinese eat their meals \"family style.\" Then again, we weren't sure whether we should feel insulted or amused.",

    "text": "P.F. Chang's China Bistro is a chain that is located across the states. This particular restaurant was the first that opened in Pittsburgh. It is good to come for lunch since they offer a shared 4 course special for a party of two for around $42.00.  You start off with a cup of soup, It is usually egg drop but they did let us substitute won ton for no additional cost. You then get a choice of an appetizer. We chose two egg rolls which we could split. You get the entree of choice. I had sesame chicken and my girlfriend had crispy honey chicken that was lightly battered and came with rice sticks.  I enjoyed the soup, egg rolls and my sesame chicken. It came with peppers and broccoli. It was very good. You can only order white or brown rice with this special. I would imagine fried rice comes for a slight uncharge. My friend liked her chicken but said that the rice sticks had no flavor to them.   The last course was a dessert that was fried banana with a scoop of ice cream and some fruit.It came with two forks so it was a bit difficult to split in half but we managed. We liked the banana but weren't too fond of the ice cream. All in all it was a good deal for lunch. They do offer lunch specials during the week for smaller portions as well as cheaper prices.   They have a full bar with TVs blaring. Located near Barnes and Noble at the Waterfront it wasn't too crowded so we were able unwind and enjoy a nice lunch at a decent price.",

His Chang's Spicy Chicken (extra spicy) turned out great, and provided the extra requested heat.  My Orange Peel Shrimp were as good as I'd remembered-- perhaps better because they have some fresh orange slices included as well.  We also ordered a Great Wall of  Chocolate.

    "text": "I normally love this chain restaurant, but this wasn't a good experience.  We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and there were plenty of empty tables.   Our server was very perky and took our drink orders.     One of the reasons we picked here is because they have a nice gluten free menu.  We ordered appetizers, soup and entrees.  Our soup arrived first which just irks me.   Appetizers first please!!!!!!     The wonton soup was good, a bit different than most since it contained several shrimp and water chestnuts. We then waited a long time for our dumplings.  They were presented by a kitchen staff and looked beautiful but they didn't bring plates and he dashed away before we could stop him.  Although our server had stopped by too many times before this, she was now nowhere in sight.  We just ate them off the serving plate. Good, not great.  Not really hot, especially after waiting all that time.  The server did come by at some point to apologize for the delay and explained that's why she brought soup first.  The manager and the server continued to keep dropping by to the point of annoyance.   We waited forever for our food which was crazy since there were few patrons.    Our entrees came, again with no plates. We caught him this time and he slowly brought back 3 plates.   The bottom one was dirty and nobody in sight again. I got up and went to a serving station where a different server was standing and asked for a clean plate. He reached under the counter, pulled out a plate and then picked a white cloth up off the counter, wiped the plate and gave it to me.  I stated I didn't want a plate he had just wiped with a cloth laying on the counter and he stated it was how they cleaned their plates.   WHAT????????  I went back to the table and used a small bread plate for my meal.  I was truly disgusted.  The server stopped by and my husband started to tell her our situation but I stopped him since we had spent soooooooo much time talking with this server that I didn't want to prolong this anymore.    As far as food goes, the gluten free Mongolian beef was good.  The lemon chicken was tough and too thick.  The fried rice had no eggs and wasn't hot.  Overall, not a great experience.",

All the traditional Asian dishes with a nice twist to keep you interested and coming back. I had Crab Rangoon and orange chicken. My mom had egg rolls and chicken fried rice. They had a nice zesty dipping sauce for the egg rolls. The fried rice had egg, bean sprouts, carrots and peas which you don't see to often anymore. The Rangoon was delicious and came in two sizes which I love because my mom doesn't eat seafood so it's nice to get a small appetizer. The orange chicken was good. We also had blackberry martinis that were so fresh you can tell they're made to order. I saw a few items go to other tables that make me want to go back and try something different. We went on a Saturday afternoon and there was no wait plus parking was pretty convenient.",

I have never seen Ma Po Tofu done this way,  they had deep fried the tofu, then stir fried in the sauce. The taste  and texture was awful,  I had about 3 bites of it, then I just ate the steam rice.  The waitress, was not the greatest either, I couldn't even get a refill on water, nor did she bother to even ask me if everything was ok with dish, seeing that it was practically untouched, when we asked for the check.  Disappoint in taste and service!",

They did the best they could to accommodate a party of 20 (Broke us up into two tables of ten).   When we get there, we notice it is freezing cold. I don't know if that is a P.F. Chang's standard or it was just like this for kicks and giggles, but everyone in our party complained. One of the cups of waters had a floating particle, which was disgusting. We ordered the food and literally 3 or 4 parties that had been seated 20 minutes after us received their food first. It was tragic.   The food was good for the people who like P.F. Chang's. As for me, the white rice was the only thing I ate and I enjoyed it.   Moral of this review, this is probably a great place to go provided you bring a jacket and at maximum one other person.",

Chang's is a fast and friendly way for you to enjoy either a date night or a large group lunch. I do enjoy the serene decor and quiet setting; however, I noticed that the \"background\" music was pretty aggressively loud and a not so awesome genre.   On this particular visit, we did the \"P.F. Chang's For Two\" - a 4-course, fixed price meal for $42.95. We started with Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps, my favorite item on their menu. Between the freshness of the lettuce, crunch of the deep-fried rice noodles, and spicy chicken mix, it's the perfect bite, every bite. We each had soup - the Hot & Sour and Egg Drop. Our cups weren't full; and, we had to ask for crispy noodles to add on top. Interestingly enough, I can't even remember what we ordered for our entrees because they were so unremarkable. I've usually enjoyed the main dishes here, especially the generous helpings for lunch, but not this time.  I have to say that I've always had excellent service at this location and all others I've visited. Overall, I'm not so sure I would go back for dinner but I would still enjoy some lettuce wraps and a chicken dish for lunch anytime.",

    "text": "So this is our first time in PF Chang. First off, this is not your typical Chinese restaurant,the prices are a little higher than a regular Chinese places,it's Asian with a Western touch,they got different varities and I was surprised they got ribs and varities of seafood dishes.  So we were the first customer so they put us in a booth,the booth was very comfortable,however they put the next customer to the next table right next to us. Now we gotta whisper and try not to be loud and be considerate.  Our server Taylor was nice,our calamari was delivered on time,my husband got a refill for his rootbeer and she changed the glass too.  Ok now with regards to the food,we got calamari as our starters and I'd say it was very  tasty however the serving was small,it was a plate with ricestick at the bottom and calamari on top. I ordered the signature lo mein (shrimps),comes with rice. Being Asian,the pancit or lo mein was delicious and the serving was descent. I recommend it. My husband ordered honey chicken comes with rice and addtl pork spring roll. I'd say the serving was very little. It's probably 1/4 portion of the usual servings you get from other Chinese restaurant. He said it was ok. Overall experience was good,we will probably come back to try other food.",

Ordered steamed pork dumplings, which were undercooked and cold. The wait staff and manager were excessively kind about comping our dumplings, explained that they're supposed to be pink, and helicoptered near our table from the rest of our meal, which was undercooked and chewy Pad Thai alongside a Korean stir fry with tough, overcooked chicken nuggets. Three stars for effort from the front staff, but the food was close to being inedible.",

The Asian Grilled Salmon with dry rub was not overly spicy, just as I like it. I just acquired a taste for asparagus and enjoyed it as well. Remembering our dinner, we stopped for lunch this trip. We had a gift card for our lunch that day. The restaurant wasn't crowed so no reservation was needed. It was a Monday afternoon. I like the decor and the atmosphere of the dining room. I ordered the weekday lunch paring. California Roll, and Vegetable Spring Roll and added the Egg Roll , it was really good!, would definitely order again. The service was great, friendly and very accommodating to us. The gift card helped to absorb some of the cost. The cost is appropriate for what you receive, but some will say it is still too expensive. As many have posted it is not your typical Chinese restaurant, more like a California yuppie vibe, but I like it. It's clean, neatly laid out and it offers a great decor and atmosphere. If you're willing to spend the money it is worth it. I would say, I would be back if I had another gift card or certificate.",

Every time I've been here I've had impeccable service. I've even met the manager who stopped by our table to check on us on one or two occasions. They care about food, flavor, and the experience and I can tell. The menu has a variety of oriental food for you to enjoy. When I first started coming here I was basic with my order of shrimp fried rice and now I venture off into other things. My new favorite is their Korean inspired Bibimbap. As someone who's tried it from an authentic Korean restaurant, I love their American style version. My only gripe is it's on the lunch menu only. I don't like eggs but the cracked egg totally makes the Bibimbap pop. My second favorite is their Kung Pao Shrimp. They know how to utilize spices and ensure that the flavors are married and not fighting. Their happy hour menu is something to smile about and their drink menu is merry. For my birthday this year I tried their egg roll dessert and it was surprisingly delicious. If you can fit room, do get an egg roll. You won't regret it. I have no complaints about this place. It's a good value. Don't go expecting five star fancy food but do do expecting to be wowed for getting so much food for a low price.",

It was peak dinner time- 6:30pm on a Tuesday evening- packed, but we didn't have more than a 5 minute wait, which was nice.   We were seated and I'm not sure if P.F. Chang's has recently changed this, but we weren't given the selection of sauces they used to give before. It's been a few years since we came to a P.F. Chang's, so didn't know if that concept still existed, but there wasn't as much as any salt or pepper on our table.   Our server was very friendly, but when we asked him for some hot sauce/chili oil, it took him a good 15 minutes to bring it to us, at which time we had already chowed down.   The size of our entree- Mongolian beef- which we paid around $14 for, was definitely smaller compared to what we had gotten before. Was quite disappointed by the fact that the pieces of meat didn't even cover the entire bottom of the serving dish. We also got the Hokkein noodles, which was enough for three people.   The restaurant is in a very nice area with other shops and restaurants in The Waterfront in West Homestead.",

Fortunately they called us after an hour. I had the steamed pork dumplings which were delicious and a perfect ratio of filling and dough, with a chili sauce on the plate. I also had the lobster avocado roll which was also delicious, especially the cream sauce that had a great umami flavor. Service was good and quick and the restaurant appeared clean despite being packed. Even though this is a chain it's a good stop when you're in the mood for something different.",

I just can't do spicy.  So I opted for the Honey Chicken Bowl with brown rice.  The chicken was a little crispy and they gave you a bit of sauce over the rice.  It had a good taste but there was some heat in that dish.  I have had their Honey Chicken here before and it's always been mild.  I'm not sure if maybe it was cooked in the same oil as a spicy dish made before the Honey Chicken but it carried spice.  The rice helped to take the bite off of the heat but I drank a lot of water trying to tame the burn in my mouth.  The others with me ordered spicy bowls and enjoyed them.  They looked amazing.  I was bummed that my non-spicy options were limited and even then I somehow got some heat.  So I will go back to my regular choices of places to eat Chinese food.",

I've never tried anything similar to this at an Asian restaurant. We shared the Cauliflower Tempura which was a hit. Tastes very similar to a Sesame Chicken, but with cauliflower instead.   Even though PF Chang's is a chain and I have to admit, I'm not usually impressed by these big chains - I was impressed with our experience here. Good food, good service. I'll be back!",

The spicy green beans on the side make the meal.   You also need to try the Bomb Pop Martini. It is not on the menu but if you like a sweet, fruity martini, then this is for you.

Our server was really nice but the night didn't go well (It wasn't completely her fault -- we should have told her we had a movie to get to.) The cocktails were okay but nothing special. For the same price we could have gone to a very nice craft cocktail place. We ordered hot & sour soup that was neither spicy nor tart, but then waited so long for our main dishes we just gulped down one and had her box up the rest. When we got home 2 hours later we realized one of the dishes wasn't what we ordered -- and it looked like a half-order of whatever it was. That I fault her for. She should have made sure she brought out what we ordered. If we had stayed in the restaurant we would have made sure it got corrected. It was my husband's first -- and last -- visit. Especially for the price we will stick with our local take-out joint.",

She continually checked on us, and she introduced us to the preferred program. While we eat here occasionally, we did not know about the program until yesterday thanks to her. Moreover, the manager came over to check on our dining experience which was nice.   I guess I'm pretty boring, because I get the same thing either: Mongolian Beef or Beef Lo Mein; they're just so good, I can't resist.

My wife's food looked like it came from a can and my food, was supposed to be spicy but had no spice at all.

The fries were the best and after that, this is said, the fortune cookies were second. Don't think we would come back, especially since the meal was super expensive!

They ran out of brown rice when we were there, but they gave us white rice when our meals first came out and delivered the brown rice as soon as they made more. Both rice types were nicely steamed and went well with our meals. The serving size of the entree is large, so you'll have enough for another leftover meal. Honestly, the price for an entree is higher than most Chinese restaurants for the same quantity. However, the quality of the food is slightly better than fast service Chinese food.  I highly recommend calling ahead and making a reservation. We came around 8pm on a Saturday and the wait was 45 mins for 4 people. Luckily the location is close to small shops and Dave and Busters to look around and visit while you wait. Their text reservation system is very convenient, so you don't have to stay I'm the restaurant while you wait.",

We ordered the vegetarian lettuce wraps first. Almost no discernible flavor to the filling, though the lettuce was fresh looking. The sauces were similarly bleh. My friend and I discussed that sometimes restaurants think vegetarian means \"I want no flavor.\" Which (SPOILER ALERT) is what happened when I got my entree.  I ordered a Buddha's Feast and the waiter asked \"steamed or fried\" and I thought steamed sounded better, lighter. Turns out steamed means they will literally just steam some vegetables and a little tofu, put no seasoning on it at all - I couldn't even detect salt or pepper being involved here - and then call that a food. I asked the waiter about this after I tasted this ridiculousness and he said that if you get the stir fry you get a sauce at least, but with steamed it's like this. Okay. So he offered to get them to make me some sauce, which was kind. I mean, the sauce was also bland and flavorless, but I appreciate his effort.  Possibly he could have warned me \"Are you sure you want that? It will have no flavoring added AT ALL.\"  My friend who was having carnivore dishes had a better meal, so maybe it's just a vegetarian thing. But my food was appallingly bad. In 2019 in Pittsburgh there is no excuse for not being able to make a good vegetarian meal.",

When a new couple sat down next to us and asked for tea the Danes waitress asked them if they wanted sweetened tea, unsweetened or mango. We were never asked. Seems like a small thing to complain about but we would of loved sweet tea. Music was a little loud over the speakers.",

    "text": "My first experience at P.F. Chang's and I'm giving it five stars!   Above all our server was spectacular. I visited with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday and he made sure we enjoyed every bit of our night. I also have a food allergy and learned they have a special menu to help me determine what I can and cannot order. Our server was very knowledgeable on each dish and made suggestions based on our preferences.   Second the dishes are large enough to have a family style meal. I love this because being my first time I never tried anything and it all sounded so good. We started with the chicken lettuce wraps and pork potstickers. Both were fantastic! The sauces provide so much flavor. I could have eaten an entire dinner just of the lettuce wraps.   For our dinner we ordered the Chang's chicken, Mongolian beef, and lo mein with chicken. We had two sides of rice. I usually do not order beef but I am so glad we did. It ended up being my favorite dish!   While we did not drink or order dessert here both options looked fabulous. I will be visiting again.",

The food is delicious Chinese cuisine!   The main courses are designed as family style, so it may be a fun way to try several different options! I opted for the Ahi Poke bowl and it did not disappoint. There was more poke than I could eat and the wonton chips were some of the best I've ever had. I also sampled my friends honey chicken which was crispy and delicious. Both came with big servings of rice.   For dessert, we opted for the new mini desserts which were also delicious and a great way to satisfy your sweet craving when you're full!  Be careful, this place gets busy! It was a Saturday night around 730 and we still had about a 20 minute wait. Service was also a little slow, but I still enjoyed the experience!",

I have always had great service at this location as well.  For starters you have to get the lettuce wraps.  The hot seasoned chicken, with a cool fresh piece of lettuce is a perfect contrast and tastes great.  They also have really good egg rolls.    For my entree my favorites are the spicy chicken, honey chicken, and kung pao chicken.  The chicken is perfectly breaded and the sauces are very unique  and each taste amazing.  I have also had the sushi here.  I was skeptical at first, but was pleasantly surprised.  They are always very fresh and have great flavor.  My favorite is the lobster avocado roll.",

The name alone, which has established a place in serving premier American Chinese food, already brings in so many people.  My past experiences at PF Chang's have been okay, but I was really disappointed with my visit here. Not only was the service super slow, but I felt that the waiters didn't really care to check in on my group and see if everything was alright. Then, the food was also really underwhelming. Everything tasted like it came straight from the microwave, or was salty beyond edibility. The dishes with sauce were absolutely drowned in sauce, and the meat was very tough to eat and not juicy and tender as it should be. For their chicken dishes, the meat is really dry and the outer shell is not crispy.  Poor service and low quality food doesn't deserve to have the name of PF Chang's on it.",

The presentations were no better than recent frozen Asian entrees I got from Giant Eagle (no slight meant to Giant Eagle).  Neither was the taste.  Perfectly cubed chicken squares covered in their appropriate sauce.  Makes me feel as if they have one huge tray of chicken and then just dump the ordered sauce over whatever was ordered.  Not high-end enough for the prices.  Sorry.  Won't be coming back.  Way too many options in the city for this nonsense.",

Yes, sortuv, somewhat. Will I stop putting quotes around 'everything'? Definitely not!  It was 45 min from closing time when we (party of 6) rushed in on a weeknight; got seated, ordered and ate without feeling rushed by the staff.  This particular PF Changs, on the Homestead Waterfront, had fast and friendly service, though he forgot our order of asparagus. We sampled everything from the the Szechuan shrimp to the Mongolian beef to the Dan Dan Noodles. Good flavors, nothing that stepped out in the crowd.

The waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version, but it was never put on the menu. Warning: even though it's vegan, it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt, fat, and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. The vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken.  They also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic, eggplant and garlic, and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables.  I always loved the fact PF Chang's offered brown rice. That nutty flavor goes so well with their meals.  The service staff at Chang's is always top shelf, I've never had a bad time here and love when we go.",

Anyway, it was a Saturday, late afternoon, and despite lots of empty tables we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and after that waited 30 min  for our food.  I don't know if they were just short staffed the day we went but I wasn't impressed with the service.  Some nice items on the menu include the lettuce wraps and the salt and pepper calamari, which comes with a separate dish of salt and pepper for dipping. The sesame chicken was also very good.  Other things were fine, just not memorable.    I think this is an OK place to eat if you happen to be shopping at the Waterfront and don't mind spending a little time over lunch or dinner.

We enjoyed everything from the spring rolls and chicken lettuce wraps...to the mooshu that they made special vegetarian for one of the guests...to the fried banana dessert!  if you are with a group, and you want dessert - get the fried bananas!  They come wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and with coconut/pineapple ice cream.  Overall, we had a great time and would come back here again.",

She was personable and friendly and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed themselves.  We were there for a while and were all on separate checks.

    "text": "Honestly, I'm furious. I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.  Tonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.  I imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).  After 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.  What on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?  The food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.  We certainly will never visit PF Chang's again.",

    "text": "I was a little peeved that the gluten free version of the Buddha Feast cost $10.50 when the regular version cost $9.50. So you're charging a dollar more to give me the gluten-free version of a veggie, tofu, and rice platter?? Regardless, it's worth it to get the gluten-free soy sauce (which I buy for myself and I know isn't THAT expensive). When my dish comes out, it's literally just steamed veggies and rice. No tofu, no seasoning or sauce. I ask why there's no tofu and the response is that the tofu has gluten in it. When I ask if there should be any sauce (aka flavor) to the dish I'm informed I could've ordered any other gluten-free dish's sauce to go along with it. Thanks for the info now...yes I'll take the GF beef broccoli sauce on the side. The sauce comes out and it's actually tasty so my food was finally interesting enough to eat, even though now I'm extra annoyed at paying $10.50 for steamed veggies and rice and why the menu made no mention that you wouldn't get flavor or tofu.  To top it all off based on how miserable I feel now, I'm pretty sure the beef broccoli sauce they brought out contained gluten anyway! So I paid more, got less, and still got gluten in my food!?!?  Not a happy customer. Not going back. Not going to recommend it to anyone.",

Dinner on the other hand, didn't come out quickly at all. The rice was undercooked, and we told our server. He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. By the time I was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice. (is that the way rice is prepared now?)  I ordered the chocolate cake. I asked for a container to take half home. The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. She then realized that a larger one would be better.  4 people, not crowded...2 hours total.",

They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.

Obviously someone dropped the ball here.....  When we requested silverware for the table. Our waitress blamed it on the hostess. Yes, theHostess should have provided silverware.. However It was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck. As a Patron I could care less who's fault it is; just $@&&@in fix it. Defiantly took away from my pfc experience.  My Hot and sour soup is usally served with\"noodley\" things that I drop in the soup. We weren't given any \"noodley \" things . Not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isn't selling food as much as they are selling an experience. This experience is what sets this restaurant apart.",

Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :(",

I had gone to this location while in town with my family for the holidays, looking for a non-cooking escape before getting inundated with guests. A few of us ordered the lunch special with soups, my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli, and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls. Everything was great (the street noodles in particular are fantastic), but the service was a bit of a disaster- dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other, a huge mood killer with a big family meal; a few dishes came out dirty; soups didn't come out at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didn't apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders. We were feeling really ignored and discouraged, until we let Sean know. He took great care of us and went way, way out of his way to make up the experience. I really can't thank Sean enough for making sure we left in a good mood after what could have been a very negative experience. Heaven knows that a positive tone is ESSENTIAL going into the holidays with family!",

    "text": "If I had to use one word to describe my experience : Depressing. And even that is being generous.       I came in with two of my friends for new years eve before continuing on to the remainder of the evening. We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. My friend and I ordered the Asian pear mojito, which was decent. My other guest ordered a jack and coke and was immediately depressed to discover that it was all jack Daniels and a splash of coke for color.    When we got to the table, we were hoping for a better experience. Little did we realize, we would suffocate while holding our breath.        We ordered the combination fried rice, described  containing egg, chicken, pork, shrimp, and beef. When it arrived to the table, the only egg that was present was the ones we were wearing on our faces.      We also ordered the honey chicken and the beef with broccoli and again hoped for better quality. There were no complaints with the chicken, the only star of this evening.        The beef was disappointing to say the very least. To start, the kitchen sent out Mongolian Beef, rather than the intended entree. When they refired the dish, and it was presented, it looked better than it actually was. Never in my life have I bit into a piece of beef and instantly fear cracking a tooth. The beef in the dish was tough, and crunched (again a new first for me).                It will most likely be a very long time before I return. My only regret is I cannot leave a 1/2 star rating.",

    "text": "disappointed, service was ok, not what it used to be, food wasn't that great either, the cook used way to much pepper on the rice. Chicken was very tough. So then some college kids end up sitting behind us, and was acting like they where in a bar. We had our kids with us and I came close to saying something, but the manager should have seen that and took care of it, he was at there table twice.",
