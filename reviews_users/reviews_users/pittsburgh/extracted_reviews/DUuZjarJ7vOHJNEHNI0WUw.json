Soup was ok, \"cheesy bread sticks\" was a \"pizza without sauce\"..greasy bottom crust. When we were done eating we sat for 15mins, then had to go to cash register to pay. Our waitress said she thought she gave us our check. WRONG!! Needless to say she didn't get a tip and we probably won't be going back!!",

If you live in the Cor area, AJs is truly the best Italian around, and their pizza is faithfully delicious. Recently I have branched out from pizza and everything I have tried on their menu is excellent.",

Some of them come and go rather quickly but Anthony Jr's has been here for as long as I can remember. There are better places to get pizza (I prefer Nicco's which is not far from Anthony's) but AJ's is a nice place to sit down with the family for a pizza or pasta dinner. Recently I've noticed the portions are getting smaller and the prices are going up. I wouldn't recommend the salads as they are heavy on the iceburg lettuce and not heavy on much else. You can get a better salad at McDonald's at this point. The breadsticks are good. The stuffed peppers are GREAT. The pizza is a bit crusty for my taste (I prefer thin crusts) but otherwise good. They have a nice variety of toppings that can be added and always have a ,monthly special, usually some combination of pizza/sandwiches/wings which can sometimes be a real steal. All in all, if you live in the area, there are better places to make your regular pizza place, if you are just visiting and need a quick bite, Anthony Jr's will do.",

Because of the fairly large menu, it is a great place to take a larger group or picky eaters.    The interior is a bit cheesy but yet typical of this type of establishment.  I've been here twice.  Once I ordered a pasta dish.  The pasta bolognese tasted fine but was not what most places would consider a bolognese.  My husband had the lasagna and really enjoyed it.  On another visit we had sandwiches which were decent but nothing memorable.  The wait times did seem to be long compared to the number of people actually in the restaurant.  They also seem to get a bit flustered when there is a large group even when they knew to expect the large group.  Overall a decent dining experience, especially when there isn't a lot of other options in the immediate vicinity.",

We were meeting up with some family members who were visiting town for a College hockey game at the RMU Island Sports Center, so we sought something nearby.  After we tried one other spot that was takeout only, we ended up here instead.    The place seemed a tad outdated, but other than that, everyone was nice, the service was slow although pleasant and the food was decent.  No complaints other than some of the sandwiches were excessively bready (cut up the meatballs and spread them out a bit for the meatball sub and it is indeed better).  I had the gnocchi and house salad that came with it.  Sauce was good (not my family's sauce but good enough and better than a lot of places), the gnocchi seemed not frozen (I could be wrong), and the house salad was huge for side salad standards.  Loved the Balsamic Vinaigrette that they had too.  My main complaint was the wait time for our food when they were not busy.  Seems like there are a lot of deliveries coming out of there so that must slow the dining in orders down.    If you are ever in this area, and looking for a place to dine, this is a solid choice given the limited options in the area.",

As I left I asked to speak with the manager and he would not come out to speak with me, which I found out was Anthony the owner. The couple was too afraid to say anything so I took it upon myself to do so. The manager or hostess would not do or say anything about it just that they were busy. Plus I overheard the waitress tell them that it takes longer for the fish. NO she forgot their order and would not own up to her mistake. The other waitress was very rude as well and would not help. I told the couple to complain but I doubt if they did. Horrible service especially from an owner that should try to be accommodating to his customers. Don't believe I will be going back!!!!!!",

We mentioned we were new to the area and she let us know about the menu and the best things to order. Always good when your given suggestions. 2. There wasn't much going on for just a lunch shift which was completely okay with me. Our server was prompt with everything. Refilling our drinks and delivering our food in a timely fashion. 3. The food was DELICIOUS! We took our servers recommendation of hoagies and piZza. I got the house salad (huge portion) and we shared potato skins (which were home made with real bacon and potatoes!) we both got steal hoagies and my boyfriend got a small buffalo chicken pizza. Everything was so good and seemed fresh.  We will definitely be back!!!! Great job Anthony's keep it up!!!!",

Don't know how long it was sitting there before we picked it up. Still tasted great, but could have been much better right out of the oven.  I was willing to give them another shot and we did delivery tonight.  And my whole family was so glad that we gave them another chance!  Pizza was even better this time with the pizza relatively piping hot from the delivery guy bringing it to our house.  This time, I also ordered a steak calzone. This thing is ENORMOUS! It was in a pizza box and my wife thought they accidentally gave us another pizza instead of the calzone. But no, it's a calzone the size of a pizza. For $12, it's a great deal and it can feed 2-3 people very easily.  Steak calzone includes hot peppers, thin steak, pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms and onions. A little too much sauce for me, but wow is this thing enormous and delicious!",

Don't order the \"homemade\" cookie....it is NOT homemade and came wrapped in plastic wrap.... how tacky!  We waited and waited and waited for our check.   Don't think they roast the turkey here as the server said... tasted and looked real cheap... terrible choice for a Saturday night out.",

The service was so bad that I am not sure I can find the words to describe it without using vulgarity. Hey if I did that at least I would be on par with the attitude of the employees. Ok, let's put aside the bad service for a minute and talk about the food.  The pizza that I once loved was like chewing through a blackened cinder block. It was burnt like nobody's business (my complaints fell of deaf ears), chewy and the sauce was so bitter and sour.  I guess that saying about never being able to go home again is True in this case. Blah.",

This is what my 77 year old husband wanted as his last meal before major heart by-pass surgery. I picked the pizza up and got home at 8:00 pm to find a jumbo CHEESE pizza. I called and they claim it is my mistake because the order taker SAYS he read it back to me.  Anthony's was unwilling to do anything without charging me for a supreme pizza. It's 8 PM - too late to go back out. The order totaled over $40 and we have spent THOUSANDS over the years ! VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!",

The wedding soup is delicious and the bread sticks are my favorite of anywhere -- crispy on the outside but not hard and smothered in parmasean and butter. All of the pastas are tasty and the portions are very large. My BF wanted penne alla vodka, their vodka sauce is all white but they offered to mix some red in with him since that's what he was craving and everything is made to order.   I had a sausage calzone and WOW - it was HUGE. Easily enough for 5-6 meals for me. It looked like an extra large pizza folded in half! It was really tasty and was just as good for lunch the next day.   It's not \"cheap\" but you certainly get what you pay for in quality and quantity. Our bill was approximately $40 for two people with an appetizer, sodas and two huge portions of food.",

On a Monday in July.  Sicilian pizza was also huge, and good. Thin crust large was ok. Dough was passable. Sauce bland. Cheese good. Passable, but not the best by a far cry.  The bright spot was wedding soup. In Pittsburgh that is big, as there is a lot of good wedding soup here.     There is so much excellent pizza in this town. This does not rate among them. Craft beer is so popular now. To not even sell Sam Adams in bottles is a travesty. This place markets as a higher end pizza spot. With low end beer choices, and poor service, there are so many choices near here. Not horrible, but average. Not worth going out of your way. I travelled 15 miles to try. Will likely not be returning.",

And most Italian restaurants these days have been americanized.   I was told to get the calzone. My sister ordered the pasta which was very good. The price for the calzone seemed a bit high for a typical calzone, but that didn't matter to me. I ordered it.   Then it came to my table. HUGE! Half as tall as me this calzone. And filled with all sorts. Of course I was unable to eat it all and took me 2 days to finish it off.   So no matter what you order here, you'll need a doggie bag or share a plate with someone. Really... portions are giant!  But outside of the food, they have this lovely Italian group that come in and play giving it a real Italian feel. And they play the mouse song my Italian family played when I was young.   Really a lovely restaurant!  PS: this was one of the many restaurants that have attributed to my few extra pounds I gained in my 2 weeks in Pittsburgh. American food is YUM! Going to gym! ha ha",
