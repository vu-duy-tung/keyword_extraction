My wife and I have gone here a couple times and have always had a good experience.   The past time our waitress didn't have much personality but I'm sure thats not her fault. She was attentive and brought us refills and checked on us several times. Wish she would have taken our salad bowls away before bringing the main course but maybe it was just an oversight.  overall a good place to get a steak.",

I wish I had gotten her name.  she was excellent! Very attentive and we were well taken care of. When our steaks came out I was disappointed my steak was well done instead of med rare the way I like it. I usually do not complain but with cost of eating out anymore I mentioned to the person who delivered our meal that I wasn't happy. She in turn told our server and they took care of it immediately. The chef even came out to apologize. I was wowed!! She then took the steak off the bill and gave me a free dessert! That's what I call exceptional service. I will tell everyone I know and will stay loyal to our LongHorn. Mistakes happen, especially in a busy kitchen but it is what you do to correct them makes all the difference!",

Most recently, my wife and I were sat quickly, but it took fifteen minutes to be greeted. The Texes Tunion app was nearly chilled by the time we got it, and unenjoyable. We finished our drinks and were never brought new ones, even after asking. The dinner took forever, was only half right and over cooked. Then, wanting only to leave, we waited dreadfully for another twenty minutes to get the check. We only had a card, and waited another twenty to have it brought back. After two hours and ten minutes, we couldnt wait to get out of there. Bad experience. Wont be going back.",

We were given a 45 minute wait time, which again was not bad. We were waiting maybe 10 minutes when a hostess asked if anyone minded sitting at a high-topped table in the bar area. My husband and I definitely did not mind. We both ordered the Renegade sirloin with a loaded baked potato and caesar salad.  Our drinks, blended strawberry daquiri for me and iced tea for him arrived with the most yummo honey-wheat bread that was soft and warm. The salads were the perfect before-dinner sized. They were not overdressed in Green Goddess dressing and had fresh shaved parmesan flakes on top. Our steaks were definitely cooked to order and the runner who brought them out stayed to make sure we cut into them to confirm they were done to our preference. They needed no sauce like some chain restaurant steaks. The loaded potatoes were of the right size to be filling without being too much. With both dinners and my two daquiris, the bill was under $60. We both walked away satisfied. Leah was a great waitress! Thank you!!",

And to top it off my daughter had hair in her mashed potatoes! Yuck! Oh one more thing... This place was very nasty and dirty..

Since a giant piece of poorly cooked steak didn't really look good to me, I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Sandwich. On the menu, this is the description: \"Grilled folded flatbread stuffed with tomatoes, red chili ranch, avocado spread and Colby jack. So full of flavor you'll need an extra napkin! \"  When the sandwich came, after I had already eaten my poorly dressed Caesar salad (that didn't even come with any croutons), it looked pathetic. There was absolutely no sauce and only a small trace of avocado spread. The sandwich consisted of huge chunks of grilled chicken covered in cheese, with one slice of tomato and one piece of lettuce. I had to ask the server for some of the mystery red chili ranch since none came with my meal. I didn't need an extra napkin, as the menu stated. It was pathetic.   I also ate some of the french fries and green beans that came with my boyfriend's steak. The green beans were as small and stringy as a middle school boy's scrawny arms, and the french fries were disgusting and way under seasoned.  Why would anyone eat here? It was bad, slow, gross, unappealing, and just overall disappointing. I suggest they go out of business.   Fuck you, Longhorn Steakhouse. Fuck you.",

    "text": "I'm not a huge fan of chain-restaurants.  I usually prefer small, privately owned establishments because they often have their own personalities, and more importantly creative, non-corporate food.  That being said, we decided to go to Longhorn Steakhouse for the most important reason of all- we had a gift card. Saturday at the Waterfront... it's important to arrive early (regardless of your restaurant choice) because every eating establishment is always packed.  5PM should suffice- we would avoid the dinner rush (Morty Seinfeld would have been proud, RIP) and get served promptly.  No such luck.    Longhorn's was overflowing with hungry patrons; apparently everyone was in the mood for steak.    \"Your wait time is between is 60 to 80 minutes,\" the hostess said.  Seriously?  \"Maybe we can eat at the bar,\" my dinner mate suggested.  I was so hungry it didn't matter.  Within a few minutes we found some seats, and handed that vibrating-thing back to the hostess (which confused her to no end).  We were immediately served some super salty peanuts, and handed dinner menus.  The nuts were warm and salty; we really enjoyed prying them open and tossing the shells on the floor- which is ok to do at Longhorn's.  I don't eat steak very often, so when I do, I go all-out.  I opted for the 18 ounce bone-in Delmonico ($22.99) with extra veg (no carbs please) and a dinner salad with bleu cheese.  My dinner companion got the 7 ounce filet ($18.99) with a loaded baked potato.    Our salads arrived within five minutes, and were your standard steak-house bowl of greens, onions, and chopped cucumbers.  The lettuce was clean and fresh, and the dressing was creamy and tasty.  No complaints here.  Our steaks came soon after, and looked good.  One big plus of this particular steakhouse is that they use a real grill.  The meat came seared with grill marks, and smelled delicious.  I took a bite, and was happy to see that my steak was cooked medium, and more importantly, seasoned.  The veggies weren't mushy and overcooked either.  The filet was equally good.  Even though it was ordered well-done (cringe) it was juicy, flavorful and tender.  Even though the bartender was our server, he was attentive and personable. Longhorn Steakhouse is a good, basic steakhouse.  If you're looking for some good grub that is reasonably priced, this is a good choice; just make sure to get there before 5PM if you're going during the weekend.  Chef Chuck Kerber",

The chocolate cake dessert was delicious and I usually don't like cake.  Service -  attentive without being annoying. Not cheesy or dressed like a stripper which was a nice plus in such a testosterone-heavy establishment.  Ambiance - heavy Texas theming. In fact, everything is quite heavy so that you can feel like you're pumping iron at your table. Manly! Expect a bit of a cowboy crowd. At least one guest brought his pistol. Noise level is surprisingly reasonable on a Saturday night and we had no trouble having a conversation.   Value - So-so. You can eat better food for less, but not necessarily steak. The steak here is good, but not amazing. It represents a far superior value to the Capital Grille, but it's nothing I crave either.",

    "text": "It was a late night and almost everything else was closed. I was VERY happy that I had an option for dinner. There were three or four other tables filled at the time so we figured that it couldn't be that bad. I was hungry and quick to order:  Bread and Butter French Onion Soup Boneless Buffalo Wings 16oz Prime Rib (medium) with baked sweet potato and Mac'n cheese  I was happy to have the bread arrive so soon after our order due to how hungry I was; it helped that it was actually rather tasty. I was hoping that the bread would be a foreshadowing of the rest of the meal when the french onion soup arrived. I was a tad let down by the size of the soup. I was really let down when I tried to the soup; it was just not something I wanted to order again.   As I was picking through the soup, my boneless buffalo wings arrived. I immediately switched gears and dug into the wings. I don't understand what they did in the kitchen, but the wings tasted more like liquid smoke than buffalo. My thoughts of a great late-night dinner were quickly dissipating. At this point, I was hoping that the entree would should show me something that was better than what I had tried.  When the entree arrived I was surprised yet again by the fact that my mac'n cheese was missing. My server assured me that it would be coming so dug into the meat and sweet potato. I was still rather hungry since I hadn't eaten much of the soup or the wings. The meat was a tad overcooked while the sweet potato was undercooked. I moved the potato to the side and focused on the meat. While I never did receive the mac'n cheese, I don't know that I would have eaten considering the quality of the rest of the food.  After seeing the bill, I can guarantee that I won't return to this particular steakhouse.",

I have never been to a big fancy steakhouse so my review may not be the best one to go by, but I enjoyed myself!  When we first arrived, we were told it would be a 45-50 minute wait...it was Valentine's Day weekend, so that was expected.  However, 15 minutes later we were seated and giving our drink orders!    I got an 8 oz sirloin, cooked medium rare, with mashed potatoes and let me just say, it did not disappoint!  The steak was full of flavor and was cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were delish (I love potatoes)...and our appetizer of shrimp and lobster dip was pretty tasty too!   I will definitely be going back.  It is an affordable steakhouse, where I have consistently had stellar service and awesome food.",

I got the tilapia and shrimp entree, and no restaurant ever writes how many shrimp you get... They had four shrimp with a perfect tilapia. The others in my party had flat iron steaks and a ribeye. The 8oz ribeye looked great! The reason the restaurant got only four was the messy bathroom. Mints after dinner are hidden on a shelf near the hostess station. Would recommend to friends for a nice dinner.",

The service was top notch.  Our servers name was Kirsten? she was very knowledgable and made a great recommendation for my wine.  The manager, Ed, was very helpful and eager to please, making sure everything was perfect.  He went above and beyond for us.  We started out with a few apps buttermilk shrimp served w ranch, sweet corn fritters, and spicy chicken bites.  All of them were nice for snacking on before our entrees arrived.  I ordered the 18oz bone in ribeye and It was delicious!  They served the steaks with table side steak sauce and a chili sauce you can add to spice it up.  So good!  After we were finished with our entrees the desserts started pouring out of the kitchen. Each plate beautifully presented and let me tell you the portions were huge!  They served a pumpkin spice lava cake, pecan pie, and chocolate stampede!  All were delicious.  My favorite was the pecan pie. Yum!  Thank goodness I came hungry!  I will definitely return to this Longhorn when I'm on the prowl for some meat eatin.",

After our party of four ordered our drinks they changed wait staff on us, the original one did not leave the restaurant. Our new waitress took our food order, no big deal. Our salads arrived, my son and I both ordered Caesar salads, they each had the cores of the romaine in them, you know...garbage. The bread arrived about 1 minute before the entrees. When the entrees arrived, there were 3, they had forgotten my wife's soup, she had ordered just soup and salad. They said they would be right back, 7 minutes later they arrived with her soup. How long does it take to ladle soup into a bowl ? Apparently 7 minutes ! All food should arrive at the same time.  The entrees were quite good, but the service is horrible. The restaurant was about half full on a Sunday night, during Christmas shopping season next to a huge shopping area. Now I know why. Going back there soon would be a Christmas miracle !",

The inside decor is standard western and is very clean.  Our waiter was extremely attentive patiently  giving us a detailed explanation of what the options on the menu were.   The food to my surprise landed a bit above par.   The pretzel sticks were very good, as well as the chicken bites, and sweet corn pritters for the win! Wild West shrimp was nothing special...  The blue cheese salad was alright one complaint I had was that it was uncut but no big deal.  Got an 18 oz outlaw ribeye medium well... No complaints there. Nice juicy steak.  Not a big fan of potato and leek au cheese side. Do asparagus or Mac and cheese.   Dessert was pretty good had chocolate and pumpkin spice cake, also a tart was offered which was my favorite.  Longhorn did an awesome job with this event. Loved it.",

I had a choice of a Outback, my usual favorite, or a Texas Road House. Me and my Dad picked the Long Horn. It was mediocre at best. He had the  16oz. Prime Rib, it was quite fatty and chewy. I had the 14 oz. Rib Eye. I ordered it medium and it came out medium well. Not liking to complain , even though was very chewy for a rib eye I ate half of it. When the waiter asked how was my steak I said \"ok\" and that it was over cooked. He sent the manager over and the manager berated me because I did not say somethings earlier. He did however give me half off my steak. The chowder was too salty, the Cesar Salad had too much dressing on it but the Parmesan Spinach and Mushroom appetizer was very good. Also thumbs up on the strawberry shortcake was a highlight. For a $75.00 meal for two I did not feel satisfied with the experience. I would probably not rush back to any Long Horn if other options were available.",

We have traveled enough to know a good Steakhouse in the Middle Market and this is not one of them. All it would take is a Texas Roadhouse to open up nearby and this place was closed its doors.  There is no service, no customer appreciation, no attention to expediency. You will arrive and be greeted by neglectful teenagers, on their phones with friends hanging around the hostess stand slurping soda and talking on their phones, not paying attention. We were even told one time by one of the teenage hostesses go somewhere else if you don't like it here, I don't care...  Management is completely non-existent, Tables by the dozens lay in wait of service, dirty tables in droves unbussed while customers wait for hours for a table, it's unreal!   We tried again tonight, same experience; the only reason we go back - we are looking for a good, medium price steak and Pittsburgh is lacking in the city, you can go out to the suburbs and find service. We finally walked out and went over to Rock Bottom and there you will find a restaurant running Top Notch! Go there before this place at all costs!   The owner should lose his shirt with this location,but as long as this Steakhouse is the only location in the area they will continue to operate at substandard service and people continue to accept the abuse, it's sad...",

The young lady found my name on the list and then said \"it will be a few minutes\".  I asked how many minutes and she said \"20-25\". I was like \"what?\" but moved to the side to wait. It was literally 20 minutes later before we were seated.  Once seated it took over 10 minutes before a waitress came. It was another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  Our food came and neither of is were thrilled with our food. My steak was good but I didn't like the seasoning on my greenbeans and the mushroom risotto had a very weird taste. My husband was not happy with how his steak was cooked. The Mac n cheese was very dry and the broccoli was bland. The only thing he liked was the rice that his steak sat on.  It was just a bad experience overall.",

The food was awesome, the restaurant was absolutely spotless, including the bathrooms, and front of house staff was friendly and welcoming.  We had steaks - T-bone for him, Flo's Filet for me - and both were done to perfection. Appetizers and sides were very good, and our dessert, ordered to-go, was excellent. The only thing that wasn't up to par were the seasoned french fries. They were just above warm, underdone, and flavorless, but it didn't sink the meal by any stretch. Perhaps just an off batch ?  Best part of the night, though, was our server, Leah. She was wonderful ! Attentive without hovering, quick to respond to a request, smiling and friendly - we'll be sure to ask for her the next time we visit.",

While I did under estimate the amount management was completely rude and hostile. We could see it was busy and that we would have to wait but the manager just refused to even be pleasant with us.   To the food, I personally don't do major chain restaurants but longhorn was being raved about so we decided to go. I asked my server to recommend the best steak on the menu and I ordered it. It was terrible I make better steaks at home in my cast iron. It was no flavor and the mean was not tender at all.   Overall I will never longhorn again and especially the one in water front.",

    "text": "Have to give this review because lunch was just ridiculous today. Stopped in at 12:00 today to meet my buddies for lunch (8 of us). We are all plumbers, contractors, HVAC guys, concrete guys, etc--guys who like to eat and drink a few beers even sometimes.  Two of us were the first to arrive, so we went to the big tables in the bar area. The bartender was extremely rude and said we couldn't \"just sit there\", we had to go talk to the host. We told her we have a bunch of guys coming, and my buddy told her this is where we normally sit. She didn't care. Said talk to the host.  So we did. Younger guy, we had to tell him how many guys we had coming.  He said we had to sit in the dining room area. We told him that we want to sit in the bar, he kind of looked at us and said we couldn't.  I said it's Friday lunchtime, we have a bunch of guys that want to hang out and all talk to each other. I guess he didn't understand what I was trying to tell him, but were not soccer moms on a lunch date.  They weren't really all that busy for a Friday lunch. We know our guys can be loud, we didn't want to sit in the dining area next to older people and families.  He finally said we could sit at the tables in the bar area, so we did....and we had to wait. The bartender took forever to take our drink order, she was obviously pissed we sat there.  Friends were showing up, basically had to go find a server ( not ours) to get our drinks and menus.  Our second waitress wasn't much nicer. We waited forever for food and refills. My buddy asked the bartender for silverware, she pointed to the front host area and said \"it's over there\".  Yes, we had to get our own silverware. Finally, we got a guy server who actually took care of us. Yes, we complained to him about everything, he took 25% off our bill--very cool.  The last 3 guys who got there didn't even want to order, because it was getting so late.  I actually left some stuff out of this review because I am being nice.  We meet almost every week at the Waterfront and rotate between here and Rock Bottom, and yes our bill averages at least $15-$30 each, if not more.  So Longhorn, u just got booted out of our rotation for Primantis and Burgatory.  I gave a tip, only because the last guy was cool. He did say the bartender had a death in the family, and she was in a bad mood.  If that's True, I guess I can understand. I didn't get my bill til almost 2:00, and only because I told them I had to get back to work.  Maybe we don't fit the \"clientele\" they're looking for, but they won't have to worry about that again. Rock Bottom has steaks too.",

Service here has always been ok. As someone who worked in the restaurant industry for a while, I tend to notice when things aren't going the way they should.. ie when your drinks come out after your appetizer, or when your server doesn't check to ensure your water is full, etc. However, I try to be understanding and never make a fuss about these things. Our server was quite nice but we had issues with those areas. Our food was pretty good. The fried pickle appetizer was not impressive and even for $4, it wasn't a good deal. They came out greasy and very lightly fried- it was strange. The bread here is just ok as well. Our meals were pretty good- Brendan ordered a bacon cheeseburger and really liked it, and I ordered a chicken tender salad. I was happy with the portion of the salad and the juicy chicken tenders that honestly tasted pretty fresh, which surprised me. Needless to say when I go out to a chain restaurant, I'm not expecting a 5-star meal. However, we both left really happy with our food, how quickly our orders came out, and our overall experience.",

The place was pretty empty which should have been a sign to get out. Our waitress was inattentive and only refilled our drinks (water) once in the hour and fifteen minutes we were there. She complained that she wanted to go home repeatedly. My chili literally has nothing in it except a few jalapenos and cheese. There was no meat at all and they don't put beans in theirs. It was just broth. I returned it once I was able to flag the waitress down. I ordered my steak medium and it came out rare. I'll attach a picture. They \"refired\" it for me but they took my cut-up steak and put it in a pan and brought that back out.  The pictures below are the steak after it was cooked again so you can guess how raw it came out in the first place. Finally, check out the cauliflower au gratin. It was supposed to come out in a crock. It was on a plate with terrible cheese sauce and still had its leaves on it. We asked to speak to the manager, but he never came.",

We then ordered two waters and two perfect margaritas and were really excited about them since we've had them before. As we were waiting for our drinks our waitress brought out our bread, but with no plates for us. Then our margaritas arrived about 20 min after that with waters but no straws for the drinks. Everything was ok until I noticed something floating in my drink. I fished it out and finished the marg thinking everything would be alright. They give you a shaker with extra margarita so I poured the rest into my glass and noticed more stuff floating in my drink....  I decided to open the shaker and whaddya know there's black mold all inside of the shaker. I decided to investigate my boyfriends margarita glass and noticed a lipstick stain on the rim of his glass. Now with both of us being in the restaurant industry we know how to handle things like this and politely asked our server if we could get new ones. She rolled her eyes and said sorry. She brought us new ones 10 min later.   Our food arrives and the steaks were cooked perfectly and had great flavor. Nothing wrong with the food. However my boyfriend decided to inspect the new shakers. They definitely gave us the same shaker as the one before with the black mold all inside of the rim and stuff was floating around in the new drinks. \"Sigh\". By the time we noticed this we were already finished with our dinner.   They only charged us for two drinks, but needless to say I won't be ordering another drink that requires a shaker from this place again.",

Our server was great; we sat at the bar in a high top table and our Moscow mules and margaritas we're very tasty. But the food was unbelievably disappointing. An expected 6 oz medium well filet arrived burnt with no flavor and you could barely chew it. The recovery steak was just as awful. Manager was not welcoming or apologetic and basically dropped the dish off and left. The lobster tail had two bites in it, if that. The prime rib was all disgusting fatty fat that was probably the most disappointing because of the amount we paid for two bites of tough meat. We also ordered the chicken wraps and we could not even eat them because they were so gross. Like I've said we've never had an experience like this but we did not leave as happy customers.",

Attitude, rolling eyes, took 15 min to get bread to the table, and never refilled drinks. Food was atrocious. Cold soggy fries, an overcooked steak well done when medium rare was asked for, mushy chicken tenders and breaded shrimp. Screaming children everywhere. One of the most well rounded places I've ever been in terms of failing at every aspect. Never again.",

I got the opportunity to try a sampling of several appetizers, sides, steak, and desserts .  What a pleasant surprise!     Some must haves... - The pretzel sticks appetizer.  Soft inside and salty outside, with two dipping sauces that really complimented it well.    - The fried shrimp appetizer.  Plentiful and delicious with some banana peppers and ranch dipping sauce.    - The steak!   I ordered the filet, cooked to a perfect medium rare.    - The mac and cheese.  I didn't order it, but looked on with envy as one of my companions devoured it.    - The chocolate dessert.   This thing was massive.   MASSIVE.   More than enough for two people and really better suited for four.  For $6.   What?   And it was delicious.  Not terribly rich for as much chocolate as it was, which i appreciated.     What really sold me on this place though was the service.  I went with a very large party (20 people) and the staff did a great job.   There was one little snafu with a steak - the manager didn't like how it looked and didn't serve it, which meant that person ate a little after everyone else.  We didn't really care, but they were super apologetic and even gave him a gift card for the trouble.  Above and beyond for sure.",

The table we were sitting at should not be there- it's too close and the waiters coming out had to maneuver around us which got to be very annoying when you are paying the same as those who are in a comfy booth away from the noise.   I asked our waiter for no bread & he was very respectful and remembered not to bring it.  We ordered the seasoned steakhouse wings (no carbs!) and they were fantastic! I loved the bleu cheese crumbles on top & the ranch dressing on the side.  I ordered the Napa Grilled Chicken with asparagus & a side house salad for my dinner. The chicken was fantastic!  I would wholeheartedly recommend this option if you're not really into steak. The asparagus was cooked perfectly - still had a little bit of crunch. The house salad was excellent & the ranch dressing was delicious.  Service is a little bit slower than other types of establishments, probably because they pack a lot of diners in the space & people typically get multiple courses which makes the waiters constantly busy.   It is not hard AT ALL to eat low carb at Longhorn Steakhouse. I will definitely be back!!",

One of the nice things about Longhorn is that their rare steak is truly rare.  For the quality of steak, this one was prepared correctly and really was quite tasty.    The side salad was good and had plenty of bleu cheese dressing which is also how I like it.  They were quite busy and I was by myself so I sat at the bar.  The server was friendly and quick.  The bottom line is this is a quite satisfactory Longhorn chain steak restaurant.",

    "text": "Longhorn Steakhouse is a national chain of eateries owned by Darden Restaurants, along with several other chains like the Olive Gerden and Red Lobster. It specializes in steaks, as the name suggests, but offers a variety of ancillary options if you're dining and not into beef. I do not recommend the place if you're a vegetarian, but there are some vegetable-only options if you ask for them. They serve domestic beer, baked potatoes, and other typical Americana fare. This location is unique in that it is situated at the Waterfront 'Waterworks' district, and thus is surrounded by historical artifacts and displays, atributing the Pittsburgh steel industry. It really adds something to the ambiance to be able to have a nice steak dinner, and then have the opportunity to walk around the waterfront district. There is a lot to see in the area, especially with the Allegheny Trail so close by. the dining experience was typical as it is with any other Longhorn.  Pros: decent steaks and options for add-ons, lots of appetizers. Great waterfront district location. All steaks are cooked in a manner that is appealing to any taste. Cons: parking lot could use a few more access points. Dining area seems a little crowded with tables, so I would suggest also spacing tables farther apart.",

The waitress was extremely patient and helpful as the company I was with were a little hard to deal with. There were constant complaints and spilled beer but she was polite during all of it. Her pleasant attitude made up for the food being just ok.",

We were seated in time to surprise her when she walked in. Our waiter, Cory, did a great job.  Food was great! The firecracker shrimp and mushroom appetizers were perfect.  Everyone's meals were good.  Thank you Longhorn for making this a great day for my mom and our family.",

The hostess tried to sit us right next to the party which of course we would not welcome. when we said we wanted to move she slammed the menus down on the hostess stand huffed and turned around to look in the computer. we were so insulted that we left would never come back as long as that person is employed.  There is a clear lapse and training at this location you need to make all guests feel welcome and happy. You need to learn how to anticipate needs and understand what service means.",

(Which reminds me, I should probably write an angry review about how slow Comcast is to hook people's cable up around here...)  It's a chain steakhouse with a Texas vibe, forgettable overall.  The husband got a steak and fries which he deemed \"good.\"  (There's a reason he's not on yelp...)  I had a salmon caesar salad with way too much dressing, but the salmon was perfectly cooked.  Everything was quite expensive, with meals starting around $15.  I don't think that we would come back.  I would rate this place around 2.5--rounded up for the excellent service (even though we sat at the bar and didn't drink) and being open on a major holiday.",

    "text": "I went to dinner here a few nights ago and I was extremely dissatisfied with my experience. I ordered a filet and when it came out it did not look like a filet to me. It was about 1/2 inch thick, not tender and overcooked. I asked a hostess to bring over our waitress to the table where I proceed to ask her if this was actually a filet. She then said she would bring over the manager because he was more knowlegable about steaks. The manager came over and I explained to him my disatisfication with the steak. He then proceed to talk to me in an condesdencing manner, explaining to me that all steaks are different and that the cooks use weights on the steaks while they are cooking and that's why the steak appears \"squish\". He never apologized and never offered to resolve my problem. After the manager left our waitress then came back over and asked if the problem was resolved. I again explained to her that it wasn't and I was still disatisifed with my meal. She then said she would talk to the manager again and I saw them go into the kitchen and exchange words. The manager never came back out again but the waitress came back to our table and apologized profusely but she couldn't do anything to solve the issue. I left without finishing my food but paid full price for it.",

I have a 3 month old that is breastfed and of course sometimes children are unpredictable and in the middle of dinner they seem to always want to eat. I am not one of those mothers that will feed at a dinner table and was very leary on taking her to the bathroom to feed. But since I didn't have much more of a choice I went to the bathroom. The bathroom was very clean and also had a chair in the family changing/handy-cap bathroom, which was definitely a added bonus to the great food!",

    "text": "We went here last week for my friend's birthday. There were four in our party, five counting my daughter. We all ordered steaks, though there are some tasty sounding seafood choices, as well as chops and ribs. I had to fight with myself over a strip or the ribs and ultimately chose the strip.  Two of us got filets, I got the strip and my father got the top sirloin. We all got salads with our meals as well as mini-loaves are dark bread. My father and I got the blue cheese dressing and its killer. Big chunks of blue cheese in the dressing. I could almost have eaten the dressing out of a bowl. Actually...I could have. Its that good (and I love blue cheese).  We also ordered the potato chips appetizer. You get a big platter of fresh-fried potato chips. They're thick cut and crispy...perfectly so. They're dusted in sea salt and comes with a BBQ ranch dressing.  We got our steaks. I was told that Longhorn is a place here in Pittsburgh where you can order a good Pittsburgh Rare, which I did so. Well they got the charred crust down pat. But I ended up getting a Pittsburgh Medium Rare. It was still good, though. The crust was salty, peppery and charred....slathered down with a creamy dollop of butter. Everyone else's steak was done perfectly. Two mid-rare filets and a medium sirloin.  My only complaint was my \"fully loaded\" baker was loaded with butter, sour cream, cheese and bacon bits. But there they were very skimpy with the toppings....even the butter and sour cream. There was literally only five or six bacon bits and about ten little strands of cheese. It really wasn't \"fully loaded\", more like \"kinda loaded\".  The service was slightly above average. The server and food runners were friendly and prompt. Nothing they did, though, really stood out. The manager came to check up on us, too, which is always nice. The only other complaint is that they sat four adults and a 2 year old on a regular 4-top table. We were all a bit cramped. I don't know why they didn't stick us at a bigger table. I'm not sure this place is the most kid-friendly.  All in all, we were all very satisfied. The steaks were all great. The prices are slightly above average but they won't break you. Aside from the cramped eating conditions, everything was well above the bar.",

After about 55 minutes of waiting with no waiter, a manager finally came up to us and explained that they had just changed kitchen slip printers and did not bother looking at the old printer for the last order on it, so our receipt was just sitting there and no one noticed (or cared that we were sitting in their restaurant not eating for so long).  There were people who came more than a half hour after us who had FINISHED eating before we got our food.  The parmesan crusted chicken was at least a bit tasty so it received another star for that.",
