I've been to this location a couple of times in the past 2 weeks and the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because, surprisingly, there is no baby changing table in either of the bathrooms. There are high chairs for babies, but nowhere to change them.  Had to change my son in his stroller, in the bathroom.  It would be a very easy and relatively inexpensive feat to install a changing table in each bathroom.  Chipotle is supposed to be a family friendly place, let's get it all the way there.",

Everything was going pretty standard until the employee at the end of the line, a young girl, started to wrap my burrito (which I do not think was 'too full'). She was having a rough time with it (I don't blame her, I would hate wrapping burritos, I probably would suck at it). She started to get the sour cream all over the wrap, the guac fell out and she did not put any more in, I was loosing my protein also. Not even exaggerating, my burrito looked like a murder scene from a kill room on Dexter.  She quickly tried to pass it off on me. I asked her politely if she could rewrap it, she told me it was 'too full' and gave me a nasty attitude while she rewrapped my burrito. Slamming the tortilla on counter aggressively. Throwing a hissy fit and mumbling under her breath. When she was done she literally threw the burrito and it smacked into the cash register.  I asked for the manager, who was very nice and did not make me pay for my burrito, and while I appreciate that very much, the experience alone is enough to make me take my burrito cravings else where.",

I love the variety of options available to customize your tacos, burritos, and the like.  My go-to is a chicken burrito bowl with brown rice (I want that recipe, STAT) and all the toppings.  The chips taste delicious if you get one that isn't a salt-lick and the guacamole is great, too.  I don't always spring for guac, though - relatively speaking, it's pricey for the small cup.  While the servers are friendly, the person at the register is always unpleasant.  I've been here multiples times and it's always someone different but with the same sour expression.  They do tend to herd you along, especially towards the end.  Every time I'm here, I feel like I have to pay with a debit card because cash just takes too much time for them.  Heaven forbid I put my change in my wallet before moving away from the register - that will get you a sigh and an eye roll to go with the sour expression.  If you can, come during an off-time if you want to stay there to eat and to minimize the sighs.",

The vegetarian options are plentiful- tacos, salads, burritos, burrito bowls, etc. I'm careful to only get the black beans though, as the pinto beans are cooked with bacon. I adore the corn salsa, sweet and a little spicy. When you go veggie, there is no extra charge for their outstanding guacamole, which I typically get on the side. Then if you buy a bag of chips, you've got plenty of guac for dipping and loading up whatever creation you've made! Staff is always fast and friendly. And strangely, the music they play in Chipotle is always pretty awesome. Always appreciated, I'd much rather listen to Sleigh Bells while waiting in line than Michael Bolton.  See you next week, Chipotle!",

    "text": "You know what, I love Chipotle. It's way better than Qdoba, and let's not talk about Mad Mex anymore ever again. You probably don't need a rundown on the menu items, but their guacamole is amazing (pure avocado with minimal extras), their chips are thin and salty and lime-y, and everything else is pretty darn good. I don't love the chicken or the steak, but that's just because I prefer shredded, slow-cooked meat to go with my salsa.  My current favorite thing is just to go with the salad, with pinto beans, carnitas (the only meat there that isn't cooked in soybean oil, just FYI), as much of the pico, tomatillo, and hot salsas as they'll give me, and some cheese. Filling and way less carbs than the burritos, as good as those are. The dressing (a citrus cilantro of some sort) is pretty good too, though you won't need much with that salsa on there.  This location is pretty good; they only rarely turn out overstuffed burritos that split down the side, and they're fast. One of the gals recognizes me and gets the guacamole ready ahead of time, which I always appreciate. The seating area is reasonably accommodating, unless you get there at the same time as an entire Little League team, and they do have patio seating in nicer weather. Parking is easy; getting in and out, not as much, but it's McKnight road, so what can you do?  Heads up: Their exterior door is, for some reason, absurdly heavy, so just be aware of that so you don't look like a putz, as I often manage to do.",

The person gave me a new tortilla and added a huge dollop if sour cream under the hot wad of crusty beans and filling from the first try and created this sloppy warm mess of a burrito.

Every time I come here, the workers are ignorant and rude, they rush you completely out of the way and don't give a crap how little they put in your bowl. This bowl that I just received, I asked for a little more sour cream, they gave me a dirty looked and literally scooped another entire spoonful onto my bowl. I literally can't taste anything but sour cream now and the bowl is just ruined. Save yourself the frustration and go to the one in mccandless crossing. Avoid this place like the plague.",

    "text": "THERE WAS A DEAD FLY IN MY BOWL. I got takeout from the Chipotle at 4861 McKnight Rd, when I got home and opened my bowl, I saw a DEAD FLY in it. I have uploaded 2 photos in the photos section. I'm sure the fly was from the store because I saw it as soon as I opened the lid and it was dead.  I called the store and asked to speak to the manager. She told me to go back to the store to get a refund for the amount I paid, or a free entry. She did not sound sorry at all. NO APOLOGY, NO ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT. Since I already know their food is not clean, I did not go back.  In addition, my husband has a sensitive stomach and he often got sick after eating there, which generally is an indication of unclean food. But due to the fact that Chipotle's food is so delicious and this location is very close to our home, we still visited a lot -- until I saw a whole fly in my bowl. We definitely won't go back anymore, no matter how delicious the food is. I've also seen a worker there accidentally dropped a plastic dip container into the Guacamole tray, she saw it but didn't pick it up immediately, she went back to work on someone's order, then picked up the container afterwards. After seeing all those details, I don't even want to imagine how they prepare their food. In short, what you eat there is not as clean as you assume.   I want to remind future customers to avoid getting food from this place. If you do, check your food before your eat, to make sure there's nothing like a fly in it.  Chipotle is still good, but this location is the worst.",

Got burrito bowls with my husband tonight with a side of chips and guac (3.00). Left feeling hungry and spent 22.00 altogether. They gave us a ridiculously small amount of chips. I'm going to say approximately 13 chips (not kidding) for two people for 3.00... lower your prices if you're going to give that amount. Super annoying. Probably won't come back for a long time.

The place was clean and the employees were fine.   Chicken tacos were okay at best. There was plenty of sour cream and cheese but not a lot of chicken (ex: one of my tacos had like 2 bites of chicken).  Steak burrito: good overall. Only problem is that half the burrito is rice & lettuce and on the other side is all of the beans & steak.. So half the burrito is a waste. Next time would order just a bowl to get all of the toppings together.  Steak/chicken bowl: much better option than the burrito. Tasted good. \"Pretty hard to mess up.\"  Chips are REALLY yummy. I love the salt and lime. I would go back just for the chips.  Total for 6 chicken tacos, 1 burrito, 1 bowl, 3 bags of chips & 2 drinks: $39.",

We ordered a children's chicken quesadilla, and a salad for me but the quesadilla was left too long in the press and then lost (I assume they gave it to a to-go customer).  My daughter had eaten all the chips waiting for it and by the time we got the (second) quesadilla it was uneatable.   A timer is needed for the quesadilla press. There's no need to cook it, only heat it enough to melt the cheese. A child can't wait for their boiling hot melted cheese to cool off.",

Surprisingly, there's enough flavor in just those ingredients that I can pass all of the filthier options and be happy with my reasonably-healthy lunch!

Group of four of us walked in at 9:35 pm and was greeted with great disapproval, including exaggerated shoulder shrugs and loud sighing. With these gestures, the staff gave us the impression that our patronage was unwelcome and inconvenient. Exited immediately upon being received with that response. I work too hard for my money to use it to reward such poor customer service. I will not be returning. This is not the only restaurant in the neighborhood, many of them happily welcome customers to their establishments and receive their customers very graciously. I choose to spend my money with establishments that earn my business. Employees attitudes must improve drastically or this establishment doesn't stand a chance at survival in a competitive market. I hope this review can serve to help rectify the situation!",
