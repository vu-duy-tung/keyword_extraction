    "text": "We never dreamed that, tucked away in the West End, there would be such an incredible restaurant.  Authentic Italian cuisine, wonderful people and one of the best times in a long time at a local tavern.  The linguine and white clam sauce could not have been better -- light, smokey and loaded with tender clams over pasta cooked to perfection.  The Seafood Ala Scolio was better than any we've had at the traditional Italian chains that seem to be everywhere.  This dish is not to be missed.  Mussels, clams, scallops and shrimp a-plenty over penne pasta, tossed in a delicate garlic aglio with fresh basil and spices.  Portions were more than enough to satisfy and even some to take home.  The prices were so reasonable, you could indulge in a great dinner and then move over to the charming tavern for after dinner drinks with welcoming, friendly staff and patrons.  The owners Ray and Terry are gracious and show that putting your heart and soul into your business really pays off.  This is a place we will go back to again and again.",

Between the food being hit or miss and staff seeming like they'd rather be anywhere else but at work, I get what one would generally expect coming to the West End for Italian cuisine. With all of this being said when I went in for a meal with my wife this Saturday we left with a feeling of frustration, but also bliss. We had ordered a simple pasta with meatballs and were first told they \"sold out of meatballs,\" than we waited 45 minutes to finally get the meal. You would think we waited in agony, however it was quite the opposite. The waitress we had was named Hayley, she had more class, kindness, and patience than I have ever seen in a women her age. We witnessed her being screamed at by tables for things out of her control, and people from the kitchen popping their heads out from the swing doors to bark orders at her. With this being said, you would expect for any server in their right mind to bolt for the door, but not her she continued being kind, apologetic, and defending the restaurant in the most eloquent way. Rarely do you see employees willing to defend a seemingly sinking ship. After all of the madness our food did turn out amazing, we tipped Hayley $20 on a $25 dollar check, i'm not trying to sound like a high roller, rather than to show how much we admired this girl.  Her reaction was giving us a huge hug with tears in her eyes, and overly expressing her gratitude! I had to write a review just to give this young girl credit, and to say if your going to take the risk of going to this establishment check to see if Hayley (the angel in a place like hell,) is there. HOWEVER, you must hurry because in addition to all the qualities in her I have already mentioned, she also is booming with ambition and will be returning to college soon! Thank you Hayley, you restored our faith in your generation!",

We have gotten take out recently and the cheese sticks, were barely cooked, yet the cheese had melted out of most of them!  And some sort of watery discharge was leaking out also.

Parking:  First there is no parking lot, it is all on street parking, which was fine because it was after 7 and we didn't have to put money into the meters.  Ambience: Great design and layout of the location, brick walls, wooden booths, old wine bottles on wall.  Service: Absolutely terrible. We never got refills on our water or soda. We received the food and never asked if we needed anything. Had to go to the waitress to ask her for red pepper flakes. The other waitress was kissing some guy a few times, and she never came over either. I didn't even try to get management as the lady who looked to be the manager was texting on her phone the entire time and looked uninterested in helping tables.  Food: We ordered the pizza and it was absolutely awful. Think $5 antoons pizza in oakland. The middle completely fell apart. And the pizza was over topped. I never thought you could put too many toppings on a pizza. But it must have been close to a pound of hot peppers on it, and this pizza crust couldn't manage to hold it all together.   Overall: I will never come back to here.",

Additionally, while I appreciate a good buttered bun, this was entirely too much butter (or whatever) product on *both* sides of the bread. The sandwich was small, but it was priced accordingly.  The sweet potato fries were a nice surprise, however, and better than most I've had at other local restaurants. They were fresh cut (or at least appeared to be), meaty, and fried to perfection.  Service was OK, but nothing to rave, or thankfully, complain about.  I'd like to return to try a \"tomato pie,\" the item my lunch companion ordered.",

Doors to the outside were open to allow the fresh air in, unfortunately cigarette smoke from outside the door was blowing back into our dining area.  Menu is quite limited, marinara sauce was tasty, salad had lots of nice greens.    Many other choices to eat  with a better menu, cleaner bathrooms and are honest enough to accept coupons.",

    "text": "We made reservations for dinner before the theater. They were aware of that and we allowed an hour and a half for dinner. It took over an hour for our food to arrive which included three salads and a fried fish sandwich. We had to track the waitress down to find out where our food was, when she finally brought it out it was cold. When we told another server about it, her answer was well we're very busy. People at tables around us left because their food was taking too long to eat and get to the theater. We passed another couple sitting in a pizza restaurant and two other tables took their food to go. The only reason we went was because they were near the theater. I would recommend that people not go",

    "text": "Oh Village Tavern, you used to be one of my favorite Italian places in the burgh. But the last few times I visited, I've been less than impressed.   My visit today was so disappointing. There were a group of 6 of us there for my mother's birthday. I think our server was recovering from a major night out or this was her first day ever with a job. I get it- being a server is hard. I stuck it out for 2 years and eventually gave up, because I wasn't a very good server. But NEITHER WAS THIS PERSON.   We had to flag her to come take our orders. She seemed surprised like \"Oh, I've only given you 20 minutes to read through our one page menu. Are you sure you're ready?\" We had to ask for silverware after our food was delivered. We had to ask for coffee refills eleventy-billion times. We had to ask for red pepper flakes twice. We had to ask for our bill twice. I never got my water refilled once. I ordered a beer that never showed. We waited and waited and waited for everything. There was one other group of four in the entire dining room, so it's not like it was slammed. We still tipped her well, because- life is hard, yo.   The food wasn't all that great this time around. I usually go for dinner and today, it was lunch. So maybe that makes a difference? My husband's Reuben was the most pathetic Reuben I've ever seen! If I'm going to pay $10 for a sandwich that meat better be at least an inch thick. My dad said his burger was \"meh\".   I love their red sauce and their meat sauce, their stuffed peppers, and their fried provolone. The salads are good too!   I'm not going to give up on this place because I'm an Italian girl who needs her sauce on Sundays, but I'll probably be getting take out from now on.",

    "text": "I'm really not sure how this place ended up with 4 stars, because I was struggling to give it two.   Service at the bar dragged it up, but that's about all that I have positive to say about the place.     I went there for a wine and coloring book event, but had dinner at the bar first.  It was warm in the bar, but even warmer (sweltering really) in the restaurant section.  The food was freezer fare that they made an attempt to dress up a little.  The buffalo chicken wrap had potential, but the thin buffalo sauce leaked all out of it and it ended up a big soggy, greasy mess.  The lettuce on it was questionable as well.  The sweet potato fries were passable and were served with apple butter, which was a nice touch.  It's still freezer food though.  I also found it really odd that they were filling their ice wells with 20 lb bags and were serving soda from 2 liter bottles.   Once I moved to the dining area, I wasn't sure which was worse - the sweltering heat or the \"entertainment\".  At first, we thought \"what is with this music selection?\"  The bar was playing contemporary country and this was stuff my grandparents would have listened to.  Then, we thought \"hmmm...this version of the song really sounds like bad karaoke\".   After looking around, we see a guy out on the patio with a karaoke machine.   Oh...that explains it.  It IS bad karaoke.   30 minutes later, though, we thought \"why is this same terrible guy still up there?\"  And then he pulled out a trumpet and clearly, it wasn't just karaoke night - this was the intended entertainment.  Yikes!",

The Village T & T is a cozy little place, with hard wood booths and tables.  The menu serves traditional Italian fare.  I ordered the Zucchini Parm special and my Mom ordered the Chicken Romano.  The zucchini was good, but the chicken was out of this world!  And, as stated before, the side salads had no iceberg lettuce at all! Score.  The only advice I'd give is to have one waitress per table.  Even though the waitresses were very nice, we had two - two came to the table to take our order, and they seemed to switch off duties throughout the meal.  It just felt a bit crowded and I felt more pressure to order quickly because there were two people waiting to take our order.",
