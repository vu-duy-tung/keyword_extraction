    "text": "Another awesome stop on my first visit to Pittsburgh.  Penn Brewery is such a nice brewery to check out if you are in the area.  Pitt has a lot of small breweries around town and it might be hard to pick one but Penn Brewery is a must stop in my opinion.  Coming from Florida we have some amazing local brewers to choose from (Funky Buddha, Due South, etc) so I was excited to see what Pitt had to offer.  The building itself is very beautiful, all brick and very open in the front they even have outdoor seating when the weather is warm.  When you walk in all you can see is a big open and beautiful dining area, a huge bar and the brewery itself you can see through the glass.  There is also a downstairs area but we didn't go down there we stayed at the top to eat and drink.  When we sat down we got the bad news that they were out of the Pumpkin beer (it was October so they said they go through it fast).  So we decided to try the 10 glass sample of beer instead and it was perfect for the 3 of us.  We really loved the beer even the IPA they had was really interesting.  My favorite was the Penn Dark and my niece really like the Penn Gold.  The food....  We came in for lunch after working up a pretty good appetite walking around town.  There is a big polish influence in Pitt so there are lots of things on the menu that show that influence (think pirogues, and schnitzels).  I ordered the Schnitzel Sandwich (breaded pork cutlet sauteed and topped with grilled peppers, onions, mushrooms, vinegar slaw, Swiss cheese and Dijon mustard).  O M G!  This was delicious!!  I ate all of this sandwich I could not put it down.  It came with German potato salad, which apparently has vinegar in it and I wasn't a fan of that flavor combo.  It wasn't bad just not my thing.  I only ordered it at the suggestion of the server but I think it was more of a personal taste type thing.  My friend got the mac and cheese and it was good she ate it all.  The only thing I would say is she thought it was a bit greasy as it came with a lot of oil covering the top from the cheese.  My niece ordered the Kielbasa Reuben Sandwich, Pitts twist on a classic (thin sliced kielbasa, sauerkraut, thousand island dressing, Swiss cheese, and a potato pancake on grilled pumpernickel bread).  She loved it and there was nothing left of the sandwich she killed it. Definitely check out Penn Brewery if you can and get the Schnitzel Sandwich!!",

    "text": "Last weekend our travels took us to the West side of PA, a little known town by the name of Pittsburgh.  While visiting friends and family, the minute we walked into the door before our bags even hit the floor, our hosts said 5 words.  \"Let's go to a brewery.\"  The dude abides.  So despite just getting out of a car we were in for 7+ hours, it was right back into one, as we headed to Penn Brewery.  On the north side of town, Penn Brewery is the Burgh's oldest and largest brew house, and we were   happy to pay a visit.  As you see from our photos, its attempts to model itself after European Beer gardens is a welcome sight.  Apparently this part of town was heavy on the German settlers, so they had their influences correct.  But how was the beer?  Here are a few we sampled with some notes.  1.  Penn Pilsner - this is their flagship.  They pride themselves on it.  A German style brewery prides itself on a Bohemian style beer.  Interesting.  They claim it's smooth & mellow.  I was not alone at our table when I say it was neither.  It was bitter, it was in your face hops, it was heavy.  Light to the eyes, heavy to the gut.  Not a fan.  This was a NO.    2.  Penn Dark - This one would be more my style.  Dark, heavy, Munich style Dunkel.  It had what a dark should have.  Roasty malt scents and flavors, a bit of bitter countered with a bit of sweet, still a little heavy on the hops, but a big improvement over the Pilsner.  This was a YES.    3. Penn Weizen - We are all familiar with this style, the nice Bavarian wheat.  Several award winner according to them, including a Men's Journal top 25 beers in America.  Bold statement.  But it stood up to the test.  This is one of my favorite styles, I could tell easily if you screwed it up.  Penn gets a YESon this one.     4. St. Nikolaus Bock - Very malty, extremely dark and heavy, warming gut, sweetness to the taste and the nose, this was the one.  If we had had this one around Christmas time it may have been a winner.  Or very close 2nd.  This was a good one, my fave of the day, and would definitely get again.  YES.  Unfortunately the road weariness played a huge part in how few beers we sampled this night.  But what started out negatively with the Pilsner, ended very strong with the Nikolaus.  Penn Brewery is more than OK in our books.  Wrap Up;  Had some TVs ready to watch the Pens game, decent different beers, and nice menu of apps.  Good alternative to a sports bar for sure.",

Penn Brewery throws a great party.   I have been to some pretty large Oktoberfest (Cincinnati) where all of downtown is closed.    This place had all the character and fun as the larger festivals.  The place was packed - always a good sign.   The beer was awesome.   I did not try the food - but it looked good as well.  Beer - Great Variety, Good Value, and Great Service (Served by the brewmasters themself) Price - Pretty good but will wait until \"post Oktoberfest) Atmosphere - Very neat.   a little courtyard, inside was nice / very German feel  Overall - a great place to check out.   I will be back.",

I appreciated the small parking lot adjacent to the brewery that made finding a spot much easier than trolling the narrow north side streets. I ordered a Ginger Beer and a few pierogies, which were both very tasty. Though the interior of Penn Brewery was nice, I really enjoyed sitting outside. Even though it was pretty warm in the sun, it was the perfect temperature in their shaded courtyard. I could have relaxed here for hours. I would definitely like to come back sometime soon!",

Their draft list has a selection of favorites and some seasonal choices, all brewed in house. My husband and I elected to share some apps, the German potato salad, Pierogies, and potato pancakes. The pancakes were dynamite! The menu looks promising and the inviting atmosphere makes me want to come back sometime in the spring or summer, especially since I noticed that the bike trail goes directly to their little private parking lot.

    "text": "Being a beer lover, I had to try this place on a recent visit to Pittsburgh.  The restaurant is German themed, with a large beer garden where you eat at communal picnic tables. There is also an indoor area that is much less charming.  If you are reserving a table, be sure to specify if you want the beer garden.  On the night of our visit there was a German accordion band playing, which provided a lot of (kind of corny) entertainment though it was a bit loud. The band obviously has a few fans who come regularly wearing their t shirts and at times get up to dance to the music.  The beer was good, I especially liked the Penn Weizen.  We tried a few others that were ok but not memorable.  As to the food, the fresh pretzel with beer cheese was a good starter. For the entrees I would recommend the Polish Hill Plate, which came with kielbasa, perogies and sauerkraut. This item was  far better than the breaded pork schnitzel which I found to be greasy and too large a portion of meat. The sides of applesauce and red cabbage were only so so.  Overall, a fun evening, I think that one visit will be enough, but we enjoyed it for what it was.",

You are also able to see a fermentation tank which is nice since you are at a brewery.  For dinner my dining companion and I started off by sharing the Buffalo Chicken Pierogi appetizer.  I was excited about them and they did not disappoint with every part being very good, especially the chicken filling.  For my entree I ordered a beef roll that came with braised red cabbage and German potato salad.  The potato salad ended up being the best part of the meal for me with the beef roll being average and the red cabbage disappointing.  The reason for this being that it had a very strong tasting spice that I could not completely identify (caraway maybe?) which I have never had in red cabbage before.  So in the end the pierogi appetizer stole the show for myself.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here again.  There were plenty of items on the menu that I would like to try and the appetizer was good enough that they still intrigue me.",

I heard from a local that this place has been around forever, but is starting to lose some business because of other establishments cooler appearance, outside games, dog friendly, etc. I can see the appeal in all the additions I just listed, but if you are in the mood for just good quality beer without all the other frills, this is the place to go!

    "text": "TLDR - Ok food/beer, God awful service.   We went to Penn Brewery after a hike on a nice warm day. We reached there at around 2:45 PM. It wasn't overly busy. Nobody received us, nobody seated us, the wait staff looked visibly annoyed but finally after 10-15 mins or roaming around aimlessly they got us seats. We were a group of 12 or so. I would think any restaurant would be happy to have our patronage at a time when the wait and kitchen staff had some slack.   Anyway, it took them over 30 mins to serve us water and even collect our orders. They were atleast 3 parties that came in after us and were served way before our orders came out. These people were done eating and were paying their bills before our food even came out! Our food came out 50 mins after we placed the order! Our food came out at 4:25PM when we walked in the door just around 2:45 on a lazy Sunday afternoon!! Our waitress gave us all kinds of attitude and wasn't apologetic in the least! The food was served at room temperature and was mediocre at best. Nothing anyone couldn't whip up on a George Foreman grill with some store bought sausages.   This was unequivocally the single worst restaurant experience I have had in Pittsburgh. The worst!  Give your business to people who appreciate it and take pride in putting out good quality product/service. Penn Brewery clearly doesn't.",

It didn't have the head like the German brews do, but was still plenty fizzy.  It is also the first place in the US I have seen a Doner Kebob on the menu.  This is a common fast-food sandwich in Germany, the Turkish version of the Greek Gyro.  The lamb meat on mine was finely shredded, but the overall sandwich was good.  The vinegary, warm German potato salad was tasty also.  I also sampled the fries, which were somewhat overdone, and the Buffalo cauliflower appetizer, which was good.  The atmosphere was fine.  The water refills were a bit tardy.",

    "text": "Beer, Beer, and yes more Beer!! So me and my boyfriend were heading out to a local place for wings but we ended up getting side tracked to this little Brewery! I've heard on Penn Brewery but never had the chance to get there until now. I absolutely feel I love with the decor and the quaint brick building. The out door area with the brick road was super cute and gave it an European feel. It was obviously to cold to sit outside but would love to check it out when it's in full glory mode.  After we got inside and seated I checked out the beer menu. I loved how they had their own selection of beers. I was a bit disappointed That the beer I was told to try was out of stock so I ended up going with the Penn Dark which was so delicious I ended up drinking two of them  As for food I ordered the wild mushroom flat bread and the butcher plate for 2-3 people. Now don't get me wrong the mushroom flat bread was good but I was disappointed there were so few actual mushrooms on it. The butcher plate was excellent I lived all the different meats but you only got 2 kinds of cheese which I wish I had at least one more to try.  My boyfriend got the beef and lamb Doner Kebab that I didn't try but he raved that the lamb was especially tasty.  As for our server she was nice but when she reviewed our beer menu she went over which ones they had on tap and which ones were not which was great. Then I forgot which ones she didn't have an asked about a certain one that was not on tap and she got a bit annoyed and snippy with me. I was taken a bit back from but other then that our service was good.",

Another down side is the lack of gluten free dishes --going to Penn Brewery as a gluten free person is a typical \"I guess I'm getting a salad\" experience. However, I really enjoyed their grilled chicken salad- the chicken was cooked perfectly. It was a very nice portion size as well. I've also gotten the steak cob salad --pretty good too. Nothing out of this world, but I know my non-gluten free friends love the food and beer options.  They have a patio out back that looks like a fun time in warm weather to go with friends- I would go back just for the atmosphere.",

Food was very good; we had pork loin and the sausage platter as well as potato pancakes (delicious!).

And while I've had many a Penn Brew, I've never made it to their restaurant until last night.  In one word: underwhelmed.  While the building, outdoor seating, and general ambiance were exactly what we were looking for, the food was a huge disappointment.  We were actually pretty excited looking at the menu before we left, but little did we know...   In ordering the Vegetarian Smoked Bratwurst our server all but refused to bring it for me.  He declared it \"nasty\" and that 50-60% of those ordered end up going back to the kitchen and commenced to try to sell me a garden burger or veggie panini.  I finally gave in and ordered the Pierogi Platter hoping to get something else vegetarian to share with my partner.  I wish I would have ordered the bratwurst.  At first, I was enthused by the serving size but little did I know... what laid before me were 6 dry fish pierogies with a dismissive pile of cold caramelized onions.  I should have sent it back at first bite, but second guessed my own reading of the menu.  When the second pierogi was potato, I decided just to eat them only to find the last 4 to also to be the dry cold fish stuffing.  I didn't eat the last two, we were on a tight schedule and I'm generally too polite to send a mistake like this back.  My partner had the kasespaetzle and while decent, didn't seem True to the spaetzle I've had many times in southern germany.  That said, the beer was quite lovely.  I had the Weizen and my partner the summer berry weizen.  Both well carbonated, flavorful and quite refreshing.  General menu overview: 5-6 apps from $5-8.  A few salads, 6-8 entrees from $9-20 a few sandwiches and a few desserts.",

Had a meat and cheese platter as an app and the Sauerbraten as my entree.  Both delicious and I paired it with a Penn Weizen and two Berliner Weiss (my favorite style).

Marie or Maria (sorry) was bartender, she could not have been nicer and even went so far as to ask the brewmaster a couple of questions for me.  Had a nice conversation both nights with a guy named Warren and felt like I was in my local corner bar the whole time.

You may or may not know that after almost 23 years they are shutting it down as a result of raised rents on the space that they occupy which happens to be a century old brewery (the old Eberhart and Ober brewery on the Pittsburgh North Side).  If you are interested here is the latest story   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.post-gazette.com%2Fpg%2F08346%2F934287-46.stm&s=317481d105280efd937b13ccdd81162b27fde930f385d7ab934e13e5c5c3b10d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">post-gazette.com/pg/0834...</a>    I won't go into it here as it has nothing to do with the review other than if  you are interested in their beer, food and atmosphere you better get over there and try it as the official last day of restaurant ops appears to be February 28, 2009.  They've brewed the last batch of beer on site as of late November and according to the article above will be dismantling the beautiful brew house.  I expect that the last two months will not be up to the standards that we've known for 23 years.  Other than my good byes I went to taste their Christmas seasonal the St. Nikolaus Bock. Which lived up to it's long standing standards.  Rich, roasty and complex this beer is the perfect pint or liter on a wet, cold winter afternoon.  I sat and enjoyed a couple while taking in for the last time the sights and sounds of the beer hall and beautifully displayed brew house.  Tom Pastorious (Founder) did a great job of converting this space to an authentic German beer hall complete with the rows of long tables and benches - I don't dare say picnic tables because they aren't.  When I walked in yesterday afternoon (December 26th) the place was packed but we elbowed our way to seats at the bar.  The crowds just complete the ambience and the feeling of being in an actual German bier hall.  We met two strangers at the bar and chatted for a good 30minutes - they were from out of town as well enjoying their final holiday pilgrimage to Penn Brewery.  After my first liter I grabbed the menu  (being the sucker for German food that I am) knowing what I would find on it having been here numerous times over the years.  Lynne and I split the JaegerSchnitzel as an afternoon snack.  It was served with a mini loaf of rye bread which was fresh, crunchy on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside and useful for mopping the wonderful mushroom laden sauce that makes this well - Jaeger and not just Viener Schnitzel.  A side of mashed potatoes and a side of red cabbage accompanied the schnitzel - both very good.  Yes, I'm on a plan next week - tis the season!  I've had other dishes here before.  The sausages as I recall are very good.  If you like/desire German fare and appreciate craft brewed beer this is a great destination.  Just as an aside Penn Brewery as they have for years made a showing at the Great American Beer Festival, Penn won two medals: a gold for Kaiser Pils and a bronze for Oktoberfest.  I doubt that they will be able to continue this tradition as The Lion will be contract brewing their beers which we all know means the possibly the quality and character can be impacted.  Let's keep our fingers crossed that they find a new location and can get back to their artisanal ways!    Auf Wiedersehen Penn Brewery!  at least and hopefully for a very short period of time.",

    "text": "So, on this trip, wanting to explore True Pittsburgh fare, my friends decided to bring me to the historic Penn Brewery. I'd been curious to sample some Pierogis (Polish Dumplings). I'd tried some in the freezer case back home but found them to be anything but tasty. I was eager to try the real deal. Penn Brewery's ambiance is relaxed and casual with picnic style bench seating and a bar area with TVs. The flies in the relaxed and casual area were incredibly friendly and more than eager to greet you and anything that would soon make it to our table. The persistence was damn near impressive. We were greeted by our server, a blond waitress who seemed polite but a tad distracted. I asked for an order of traditional pierogis to start us off. Mashed potato and cheese tucked in tender dough, sauteed and topped with caramelized onions and sour cream. Yum! Minutes later when she brought our drinks, she  confirmed my order of cheese curds would be out any minute. . After sorting that out and having her answer our questions on different menu items, we ordered. My friends ordered a Braumeister Steak Sandwich, House shaved rib-eye with Penn bier cheese, grilled peppers and onions served on a Breadworks hoagie bun and a Wienerschnitzel Sandwich,Hand breaded pork cutlet, slaw and Heidelberg Dijonnaise on a Breadworks hoagie roll. I, unaware of the oncoming onslaught of blandness and disappointment that would soon befall my tastebuds, ordered the Bier Cheese and macaroni and added grilled chicken to it. Cuz who doesn't love mac n cheese?!   The pierogis made it to the table and with much awaited anticipation i eagerly dug in. Everything that was promised was technically there. Mashed potatoes, greasy dough filled pockets of disappointment covered in sauteed onions and a heap of sour cream. I can't say i could taste any cheese or any semblance of salt to it. Maybe the frozen ones were on point after all? Fortunately, my friends assured me they weren't what they expected either so I guess my hunt for a proper & tasty pierogi is still a thing. lol --but it's definitely not here!   When our food arrived the sandwiches looked amazing and my friends devoured theirs. The pork schnitzel looked fried perfectly and the steak sandwich generous and filling. My plate was a massive heap of curly pasta covered in this epic Bier cheese i wanted to try (cuz -why not?!) and a light dusting of bread crumbs. #omnomnom What could possibly go wrong?!   Well \"Bier\" (apparently German for bland) cheese on macaroni isn't as tasty as I'd hoped and in hindsight, were it added to a pierogi would've easily blended undetected amidst the sea of saltless treasures. The minimally seasoned chicken breast our fearless server forgot to add wasn't any help either once it arrived late for the party and, not wanting to disappoint my friends who had researched where to find foods to impress, I put on my best tourist smile and made the best of my Velveeta situation. I even insisted on a to go box where the majority of my macaroni ended up. --Never to be seen again...   Not sure if it was an off day for the kitchen or the flavor gods were not in my favor but I definitely would recommend having sandwiches and steering clear of the pierogis and bier cheese in general. Hopefully I'll find pierogis in Pittsburgh to salvage my quest for delicious Polish dumplings  soon enough.",

Okay...then I'll just have beer XYZ please. Sorry, we don't serve that beer outside.  Alrighty then, I guess our plan to sit outside on a nice day isn't happening.  So we end up inside sitting at a long table and ordered the flight. It was brought out with no explanation. Most places explain the beers or at least tell you which are which. We had to flag down the waitress to ask her and she stumbled through a little unsure of herself. I think she was wrong on a few of them. Regardless all but the seasonal beer on the flight was flavorless and tasted watered down. The 3 of us in the party all agreed that this was the most disappointing stop on our brewery tour that day. There are much, much better choices around Pittsburgh for my tastes.  That coupled with lackluster service and silly rules for sitting outside pretty much assures that I won't be returning to try the food. 2 stars because the brewery itself looks nice and they do have a nice outdoor area. Apparently we just couldn't use it.",

    "text": "What a disappointment.  Did not even want to give it a star...This had been my favorite restaurant from the time I moved to Pittsburgh back in 1992.  I have since moved away, but try to make a stop here when visiting.  Last night was an epic failure.  The decor I loved is gone.  Penn Brewery no longer looks like a beer hall in Germany, no colorful banners or authenticity...it looks more like a poorly designed event venue... the only holdovers are the wooden dining tables and long benches.  Even the corner space once home to Oompah bands has been replaced with seating.  We were a group of seven and had a lot of catching up to do, which was enjoyable, but our server was inattentive and absent for the better part of our dinner. There were 2 other servers and maybe 7 other tables with patrons.  Tables were not cleared when patrons left and at one point I saw at least 5 tables covered with dirty dishes.  I am one of those people who likes to order the same thing at \"favorite\" restaurants.  For me it is starting out with an order of potato pancakes.  Not last night, they were OUT of potato pancakes.  Exactly HOW that happens I don't know.  While I understand there was a festival this past weekend, potato pancakes are a staple of German cuisine, not that tough to make.  I guess that means they don't make them fresh...  On to the roast pork, which I always get with spatzle, instead of potato.  My first clue that something was amiss with my dinner were the bread crumbs on the spatzle...but I went in...eager to taste the slow roasted, tender and juicy pork that so reminded me of my own German grandmother's cooking.  Nope...not to be...instead what I had on my plate were 4 slices of what can only be described as someone's 3 days old leftover pork loin cover in tasteless gravy.  I even tried a piece of each slice just to be sure, but it all had the telltale taste of meat left too long in the fridge.  On to the spatzle...now I've made this at home - not tough... batter, a sieve to press it through and boiling water;  drain and swish those delightful little guys in a pan of butter and voila!  Nope...on MY plate was a haphazard group of odd shaped carb bombs. Many resembling some alien form of pasta.  They were over seasoned with something... like thyme?  And then there were the bread crumbs....a fellow diner actually commented that my plate looks like Thanksgiving gone wrong...I will say the green beans were fresh and done to perfection.  Why didn't I send my dinner back you say??  Well, I would have if our server had seen fit to check in on us.  Even when she DID return with our checks she never asked how everything had been, nor did she ask me about my obviously mostly-full plate; she did not even offer me a box to take my leftovers home, which I would have kindly refused.    Honestly this meal was so bad I did not even want to waste more of my valuable \"friend\" time to speak to a manager.  It is obvious that changes made need to be re-evaluated.  The Help Wanted signs on the entrance door should have been my first clue.    Come to Penn Brewery for the beer - the outdoor courtyard area is beautiful and thankfully the beer is still good.",

I work in the Northside so I think the only reason I continue to come back is due to convenience of location and co workers.

    "text": "I've been to Penn Brewery more times than I'll admit, so I can confidently compose a fair and thorough review.  Ranked simply on the beer, the Brewery would easily earn 5 stars. The \"Gold\" and \"Pilsner\" are consistently delicious and award-winning. Both have been recognized by national reviewers. The Brewery has added quite a few seasonal beers to its menu, though the two above stand out. Depending on the season, the Oktoberfest and St. Nick's Bock are also worth it.  Penn Brewery's food does not score as highly, mainly due to a lack of consistency and quality. Some items are always good: the pretzels & bier cheese, the potato pancakes, and the appetizer flat-breads are excellent (especially if they are available at happy hour prices).   The chili ($6 for a bowl) is big enough to be ordered as a meal and delicious and the goulash is comforting on a cold day.   The sandwiches and entrees, however, are hit or miss. Some of the lunch meat (especially the turkey) is only okay and the presentation/taste fluctuate. The meat entrees also vary in size depending on the visit. Overall, I give 3.5 stars on the food, though I mainly order the things I know will be good.  Execution at the Brewery could be stronger. For example, although the employees are kind and attentive, they seem to lack a strong grasp of the restaurant's menu and happy hour, which has changed frequently.  Additionally, the check-in process near the bar area creates a congested and chaotic atmosphere. The Brewery is styled after a German beer house, but there is no strong plan for funneling people when they are waiting to be sat. On busy nights, it is not uncommon to eat food with a person standing above your plate.   Also, the beer - although great! - is not always available. I've been to Penn Brewery twice this summer and the Penn Gold beer was not available either time. How a brewery runs out of its flagship beer during the summer months is beyond me and if I owned the joint, I'd do everything in my power to ensure it never happened.  Lastly, I have to include mention of the Brewery's beer garden, which sits between the Brewery and a historic warehouse. Simply put, the garden is one of the coolest places to sit and enjoy some great beer. At times, there is live music, which makes the experience even more fun.   Thanks for reading!",

    "text": "I'm giving Penn Brewery a solid four stars. Stopped in for dinner and a beer and I wasn't disappointed.   We started off with the cheese and brews. We decided to go with the five cheese and five beer sampler. The cheese is really good! Everyone had an opinion on which beer was the best ( I said the penn weizen) so I'll let you decide which is the best choice. I had the bier cheese and macaroni for the main entree. It was delicious. I added the sausage to it and I'm glad I did because it was good. My wife had the rabbit and she liked it, but said she would probably try something different next time.  The beer was cold and the food was good. The service was quick and friendly. The inside setup is kind of odd but I guess it works. The stairs were roped off and you had to use the elevator to go downstairs to use the bathroom. Not a big deal, just odd because it's usually the other way around.   Anyways, I had a good experience here and will be back again. Most certainly recommend.",

The service is excellent, I've been here several times and never had to wait any longer than a few minutes. Their Oktoberfest is a blast even though it gets jam packed, there's live music and excellent food options and the beer comes in a half gallon jug! I definitely consider this place a Pittsburgh staple so if you're in the area, i vote that you check it \"aht\"!",

    "text": "I am visiting Pittsburgh with my dog and called ahead to see if the restaurant was dog friendly, something I always do before heading to a restaurant.   The person who answered the phone said dogs are welcome, but had to sit on the edge of the courtyard and informed me they had a special doggy dining area near the gates with a grass area and tables. I asked if we would be able to order food, I was informed it was full service. Sounded great, so we headed to Penn Brewery for dinner.   Upon arrival, I discovered that the \"special area\" was an area about 10 feet outside of the restaurant courtyard gates with a sign designating it as the dog area where they would move a table for you. It was also next to a frontage road and adjacent to the freeway, which is not ideal for dining or conversation. I asked if there was anyway to sit on the outside of the other gate, the staff kindly accommodated my request.   Be prepared to not really dine in the outdoor restaurant area, but rather beyond the gates. The staff explained this is a state regulation they must follow, which I understand. However, I wish that the description on the phone would've been more accurate. Also this was not our first dog dining experience of this trip, but the first time we ran into such an awkward seating situation. As someone visiting from a very dog friendly area it would've been nice to know that if you want to bring your dog, you won't be getting the full restaurant experience, since the dog isn't allowed in the actual restaurant outdoor area.  Overall the staff was friendly and accommodating. They moved a table for us, they apologized and said they would pass along my note about the inaccurate phone description. However, I would opt for another restaurant if you want to dine with your pup with a less awkward sitting arrangement.",

    "text": "Given the mixed reviews, I wasn't quite sure to what to expect when I came here recently. And fittingly, I'd say my experience was mixed, although overall positive.  We went on a Saturday evening, and I thought the place would be hopping, but it was sort of dead. The space is beautiful though, and it was a shame that their charming courtyard beer garden was not being patronized by more people that evening. We were seated indoors in their downstairs area, which was cozy, but a bit dark and dungeon-like. The evening started off on an annoying note when it took about 15 minutes for a waiter to come by and take our drink order (though he was more attentive after that).  Our waiter was hilariously blunt. Several times when we tried to order something, he shot us down with his unsolicited (though actually appreciated) opinion:  Us: \"We'll try the mussels to start.\" Waiter (with horrifying look): \"No, you don't want to order those. They are really sandy.\" Us: \"Umm, ok, thanks for the heads up. How about the peanut butter and jelly wings?\" Waiter (gives knowing glance): \"How do you THINK wings with peanut butter and jelly would taste? Don't get those.\"  Later for our meal order:  Friend: \"I'll have the rabbit for dinner.\" Waiter (same horrifying look as before): \"No, no good. Literally ANYTHING else would be a better choice.\"  Though it was a bit odd, we did appreciate his candor about the food and I know he was just trying to be helpful. Also it gave us plenty to giggle about every time he left the table.  Anyway, speaking of the food, waiter man's tips were fairly solid, because we were pleased with almost everything we ordered. To start, we sampled the Black BBQ wings, which were meaty, juicy, and crispy. We also tried the pierogies, which were good, though nothing noteworthy (I can think of about a dozen places off of the top of my head that serve a better pierogie). On the annoying side, they only gave 3 pierogies in the appetizer serving, which for $7 bucks seems a little stingy. Also, 3 is an odd number of anything for an appetizer, as most dining parties are 2 or 4 people (ours was 4). Thanks for creating an awkward sharing situation, Penn Brewery. Anyhow, we also tried the pretzel and bier cheese, which everyone at the table liked except for yours truly (I found the stiff mousse-y texture of the cheese to be unappetizing).  For our meal, my husband and I split the chicken kasespaetzle, which appears to be Germany's answer to mac n' cheese. It was really tasty, with a rich, creamy, tangy and flavorful sauce, plenty of juicy chicken, and tender pasta dumplings. Our friends split the roasted pork, which they reported to be delicious as well. Entree portions were generous and more than enough for us to split and still feel full and happy (especially given the appetizers we had). For dessert, we shared the apple strudel, and our waiter was quite pleased.  \"GREAT choice, that's the best dessert we have!\" he exclaimed a little too enthusiastically after we ordered it.   Thanks, waiter, glad we finally could nail it on the first try. And nail it we did -- the strudel was heavenly. Flaky pastry crust and warm, soft apple filling paired with melty vanilla ice cream was the perfect way to end our meal. Very good experience overall. Or should I say, \"sehr gut\" experience overall.",

I was the designated driver, and ordered water (I don't drink soda).  Janelle, the server, didn't hide her disappointment at no big bar tab. The service she gave us was abysmal, at best. She took our orders, brought us drinks, and the check. A food runner seved us dinners and dessert. The sausage on my sausage platter($18) was barely warm, though my daughter's mac and bier cheese ($14) was piping hot.  My sauerkraut was piping hot,  the German potato salad warm, and both were delicious. The Apfel Strrudel for dessert was barely warm, and dough a bit stiff. It needed more cinnamon, too. I dropped my knife during dinner, and had to hunt someone down for a replacement. Janelle didn't know how to process a Groupon, and 3 people later, I finally got a shift manager who did,and she took dessert off the bill. ($7) She apologized and said she hoped I would return. Even though I told her about my 20 year patronage, and that this was a treat for my daughter, she gave no incentive to return. So, I won't. I may call the GM and give him a chance, to be fair.",

A gothic courtyard featuring caged crannies that look as if they were designed to hold dragons leads to a staircase entry into the establishment.   There is another way to get inside from the street, but I prefer to go take the cobblestone detour since it's Victorian looking and therefore wickedly cool to me. My heroic, fantastical imagination allows me to conceptualize a moonlit, midnight clash with a ghoul, vampire, or some other such creature of the shadows here.   The interiors are jolly and anything but creepy. People holding frothy, wet mugs of housebrewed mead amidst the brass and copper pipes and tanks from which it flows. Communal, stained, wooden benches and tables are where patrons seat themselves.   I knew I wanted some pierogi, so I pretty much disregarded the rest of the menu and settled on the Pierogi Platter, a hexad of dough parcels containing potatoes and cheese with grilled onions as a sweet garnish.  Our bubbly, talkative server Amanda knows what the score is.  When I asked for sour cream on the side minutes after placing my order, she said, \"Dude, you're covered. Who eats pierogi without sour cream anyway? That's not right.\"  And out they came, quickly. In fact, our appetizer, salads, my chili, and our entrees came out simultaneously, almost overwhelming us. Some people might have found this to be a misstep of service, but I barely minded.   I mean, before I could get impatient, a feast was abruptly placed before me! Good food fast?  You bet your hiphuggers...hipster.  Well, for the most part at least. Everything was comfortably comestible, and that includes my house viniagrette salad, even if the dressing was unduly syrupy but only a touch so.  Our starter was a spreadably splendid wedding between Sharp Cheddar and Cream Cheese that was blessed by Penn Pilsner and overseen by average, dried-out, mall-grade pretzels. I would have rather had the spread, which tasted like a far more intelligent and gourmet kind of spray cheese, on some crackers instead.   A cup of their Penn Pilsner Chili was next on deck. Freshly ground chuck, kidney beans, and black beans made for fine, hearty, tomato-based spoonfuls of sweetly fermented and profoundly satisfying stew.  Hey, I may not drink beer or any other kinds of booze, but if you put it in some excellent food, I'll board the boat to Margaritaville without delay.  Oh, the pierogi; they were peerless. The outer dough was caramelized, took on the flavors of the onions, and contained the most luscious mashed potatoes ever to be served at your favorite aunt's house. As someone whose blood is mostly Polish, I was proud of these paradisiac pierogi and was greatly gladdened that a chef had come up with a proper recipe for them.   Kay had the Rouladen, a fragile, sultry, enlivened, and rolled-up carpet of steak, bacon, onions, and pickles that was coated with a deeply savorous, beer-borne, and cryptic \"brown sauce.\"   Dessert (they only have a Warm Apple Strudel and Chocolate Raspberry Cake on tap) we skipped due to having a surplus of treats at home, but please do not skip Penn Brewery. If a teetotaler like myself had a pleasurable dinner here, you should as well.",

I had the sausage platter with sour kraut and some kind of German potatoes.  All the sausages were very good dipped in a little mustard, sour kraut amazing!!!!  The potatoes were bad but I didn't care cause the rest of the plate was so stellar.  The spatzle with mushroom sauce was also outstanding with grill chicken.  There Pilsner beers are ok and I really likes the wiezen.  Can't wait to go back though for the food!!  Prices are a little steep but not bad.",

The inside was clean and the waiters/tenders were attentive. Drinks are very good, I tried multiple and do not think there was one I would not drink again- absolutely delicious.   Food was pretty good- the pretzel was tasty- a little salty but I enjoyed it still- most people love the salt- I go easy on it. The cheese dip was perfect though- the kind that makes you close your eyes and savor the moment when you bite into it.   I got the cheesesteak- it was okay, nothing to brag about, but was decent.   I will definitely come back. But the highlight of this place is the liquids not the solids.",

We tried the basket: pretzels, beer cheese, beer battered chicken strips and honey mustard dip.  that fed two of us just fine!  Then Dawn introduced us to Dave who I believe to be a brewer.  Dave gave us a quick tour of the place and broke down some history of the establishment and the hill it sits on.  He was great.  He can read the bewilderment on your face and dumb the tour down or kick it up to geek level and answer technical questions from beer nerds or the weekend afficionado.

    "text": "Best Hefeweizen and Fried Cheese curds ever!  So the Penn Weizen beer here is phenomenal. Light but flavorful and just a very refreshing beer.  The winner here is the fried cheese curds. I was blown out of the water with how great these darn things were! The batter/breading was VERY light but VERY crunchy and salty which was amazing. The cheese curds themselves were squeaky, melted and oooooooooo soooooo good.  Were also ordered the Sweet Sriracha Wings and Pomme-Frites. The Pomme-Frites (Fries with chili, bacon, sour cream, cheese and scallions) were disappointing. THey were smothered which was good but bad. The fries turned to mush (did not hold up to the chili) but the chili was decent, not great, but decent.  The Wings, ehhhh I've had better and for the price I wouldn't get them again. The wings weren't that big in size and the sauce, while okay, needed a bit more sauce. When i hear sriracha I expect to be punched in the mouth a bit lol, more sweet than spice.  Overall though, I'd stop in for the beer and curds any day which is why this place gets 5 stars, after all they are a brewery!",

The building itself is clearly old, but has been kept really well and didn't have that can't-get-the-dirt-off feel to it. There was casual seating, a nice bar up top, and quieter, cozier seating down the stairs near the beer. It definitely still had the feel of a brewery!  Everybody was happy with their food, and liked the beer as well. Personally I had some of the sausage stuffed peppers (so good, and gluten free! it's so rare to see GF stuffed peppers) and a bunless burger with fries. Everything was delicious.   We had a little snafu with our seating when we arrived, but it was made up to us in spades with a few free beers!!! I was pleased to see that the place puts their customers first and could sense we were a little uncomfortable. It made the night a lot better.   I would return if I lived in the area!",

Weizen - a wheat with banana undertones, Chocolate Stout - a collaboration with a local chocolate artisan, Nut Bowl- served with sugared rim glass, flavored with yumminess and their St. Nick Reserve.  Their Penn Gold and Dark rocked - close eyes - think Octoberfest in Munich.  Even their hoppier pilsners were really well balanced.  Food, service, band, locale - perfect.  The brats were wonderful.  Good chili.  Fresh salad.  Gluten Free menu offerings were clearly indicated.    Is a manager reading?  Offer cider or a Gluten Free Beer alternate as well as a GF dessert choice.

I tried a Moscow Mule with their housemade Hot Ginger beer.  It was average; not much flavor.  I'll stick with their beer in the future.   What really makes Penn Brew stick out is their fantastic food menu.  I dreamt about their Pierogis my entire drive from Cincinnati.  Do NOT pass these up. We also tried the pretzel sticks and BBQ chicken flatbread this time as well; I would get both again.  The pretzel sticks are served with three unique dips, all German and made in house.  The cheese dip is to die for.     For whatever reason, their menu is loaded with vegetarian option.  If that is your preferred diet, this is the place for you.",

    "text": "I've been frequenting the Penn Brewery on and off since the early 90's.  It's been many years since I've reviewed, but I've given multiple 5 star reviews in the past.  It's been one of my favorite places.  I love their beer, particularly Penn Pilsner, Penn Dark, St. Nicholas Bock, and the Marzen. They are staples at my home year-round. I'm no fan of the novelty beers such as Chocolate Meltdown and Nut Roll Ale but I understand this is for a greater mass appeal, nor is beer the subject of this review.  A group of us stopped here recently and I was unexpectedly, and highly disappointed. I think I need to give German style food a break as the tug-of-war between being so-called \"authentic\" vs. taste vs. price just doesn't seem to be worth it to me anymore. We found that the portion sizes on this visit were absurdly inadequate. One person in my party received about a tablespoon of sauerkraut while my portion was more like a cup (as expected, but still lacking for the high price).  However, the biggest complaint was related to what we received from the Appetizer and A La Carte portion of the menu:  The buffalo wings were $9 for 6 wing-dings (half wings). Do the math and you'll see that this comes out to $36 per dozen. Okay, I get it... it's not a wing place, but worse yet was the quality! These were the equivalent of the supermarket frozen boxed Tyson or TGI Friday's wings that are cooked in the microwave or under the broiler. They were slimy, rubbery and barely edible. There was a negligible amount of buffalo sauce on them.  Dear Penn Brewery: If you don't want to serve wings, please pull them off of the menu. These were disgusting!!! Take some PRIDE in what you serve!   The Brussel sprouts were $6 ala carte simply because it had the word \"porchetta\" attached to it. There was nothing \"porchetta\" about them. They tasted okay with the bacon undertones, but wow what a travesty on quality vs. price. For me, the wings alone were enough to put the chef (or line cook) on probation. We took our lumps, didn't complain and left a big tip (the server was great), but it's going to be a long time before I come back here and when we do we'll stick with a pizza or a burger and leave the German Food for home cooking.",

The brewery is in a cool historic building filled with long wooden tables and a window where you can see the beer being made. Totally great photo op right when you get there with the old light up sign outside! I highly recommend getting the butcher plate appetizer, it's a little pricey but totally worth it.  My other food recommendations are the potato pancakes and pierogies! Just order them, you will not be sorry.  As for drinks, I love the Penn Weizen but if you're not sure what to get or want to try a bunch get the sampler! With the beer sampler they give you really good size pours and it's a pretty good price.  Also if you are considering trying Penn Brewery, always check Groupon first!  I was able to get a really good deal on their amazing food with a Groupon. Penn Brewery is a great place to stop for apps, dinner, drinks or all 3!",

Other than that, the food is usually very good especially their German entrees and sandwiches.

We were a little early so we missed the bands that played later in the day, but we still got to enjoy the beer and food for the occasion.  We decided to go with a quart of Oktoberfest beer to share.  Fall beers are amongst some of my favorite alcoholic delights.  Penn Brewery makes a mighty tasty Oktoberfest-style beer.  To go along with that we split an order of traditional potato and cheese pierogi, and a sausage platter that had three different types of sausages with sauerkraut and a German hot potato salad.  While we waited for our food we enjoyed the outdoor biergarten, which is pet friendly and spacious.    Our food was delivered and it was a nice portion so splitting it worked out great.  We came with my little brother and his girlfriend and they both ordered the fish sandwich, which in hindsight they could have split one since neither finished their sandwiches.  In other words, expect large portions.  The sausages were great dipped in some mustard.   I also enjoyed the pierogis and sauerkraut but totally could pass on the potato salad.   Way too sweet for my liking.  Overall great place to hang with friends or family and share a beer and some good German style grub.",

We were very happy with all of our beer and food choices. Our server, Rachel, was friendly, efficient, and helpful in making choices. We ordered traditional pierogies to start, jagerschnitzel and the sausage platter as entrees. We ordered the dark and marzen beers to start. Later we got a flight to try others, all brewed on site. Prices are very reasonable and portions generous. We were too full to order dessert so will have to return.",

The fat was not rendered, and it was oddly spiced (cumin maybe?). In any case, whatever it was did not complement the rest of the sandwich in my opinion.  It was also offensively noisy, but not in the good way that often is to be expected at a crowded Biergarten. Tonight it was almost empty but there was some amplified speaking coming from elsewhere in the building. Maybe trivia, but definitely annoying and incomprehensible. If we come back, we will try for a night without that type of event and remember to steer clear of the French dip.",

I'm neither a foodie or beer connoisseur, so I can't & won't speak in those terms. I can simply say that this place always satisfies. My favorite beers are Penn Weizen (mmm...bananas), Chocolate Meltdown (ahh...Betsy Ann Chocolate) & Hot Ginger (well, when I could get it. Don't know if they'll brew that again, but I REALLY hope so). My favorite food at Penn - Cheese Curds, German Reuben & Fish Sammich. Always a great atmosphere, inside the Bier Hall or outside in the Bier Garden. Love it when I can catch live music there, but not sure that happens too often anymore. The waitstaff & bartenders are top-notch, friendly folks - never a bad vibe here. I feel so freakin spoiled having Penn Brewery as my neighborhood watering hole!",

When we got there, it looked like the usual crowd having a good time everywhere. We went into the big hall to have dinner, put our names in and was told it would be AN HOUR wait. I looked around the hall where there were no less than 10 tables with disbelief. I said \"Ok\" and we sat over near the bar at a hightop table. The waitress stops over and takes our Octoberfest beverage order. She brings that and we ask if we can order some appetizers. Normal request, right? She says since we're waiting on a table we can't order apps. Huh? We ask why and she says the kitchen can't handle any orders. What? So, my wife asks the bartender and he takes our order for apps. The waitress stops back and apologizes. I asked her what the big deal was and she said that since they opened the bottle shop the kitchen was MADE SMALLER. Seriously? One thing you don't need at Octoberfest is a smaller kitchen. Plus, the hall wasn't decorated in the usual German motif.  Unfortunately, in an effort to improve something, they've totally ruined a once unique event in Pittsburgh. Sorry, Penn Brewery...I'm taking my business elsewhere.",

However, I can't help but feel some menu items clearly need worked on.  I've been to Germany and had Turkish Doner Kebab and moreover I work at a Mediterranean restaurant where we serve gyro, but this Doner at Penn Brewery just looked and tasted sad.  The meat cracked off from what it seemed to be old dry \"gyro\".  I should have sent it back.    Though my family had an INCREDIBLE baked Italian sub and I couldn't help but feel slighted in the sheer effort that went into that.  The Spatzle was good, Reuben did fine, etc.    Overall the brewery does a generally incredible job with most everything, there is room for improvement.",

If you go on a Sunday you definitely miss the traffic, but you also miss the wall-to-wall people, so whichever is your preference.  (Although the poorly maintained parking lot almost knocked off part of my car).  I did enjoy the crowded beer drinking atmosphere, and they even had extra porta-poties for the masses.  If you prefer the great indoors, the women's bathroom was in a shambles, but well impressively maintained for the constant line of 10 people for hours and hours.    The Oktoberfest beer was great, and $15 for a half gallon was great for sharing.  I also had their dark beer which didn't impress me as much as I expected, but was still drinkable.   The food was very German and very tasty.  Three of us had an appetizer platter, and 3 main courses, I got the 'Wurst Platte', and with a round or so of beers the total was around $100.  The sharp taste of the meats and pickles paired well with the beer.   The outside was a great place to drink and hang out with friends, albeit loud and occasionally a bit too close for comfort on a Friday, but quite tranquil and family friendly on Sunday.  The inside was full of warm wood,serenades  from men in lederhosen, and a view to the brewtanks.",

It's a great place! Any spot where you can saddle up to the bar and strike up a conversation with locals, get to know the story behind the place, sample some local specialties- the appeal factor for me is unforgettable. The staff were a friendly bunch, all happy to share suggestions and let me sample some seasonal offerings. The food did not disappoint either. We had Pierogis (Polish dumplings) and Potato Pancake to share. Pierogis are not a typical West Coast specialty, so in my humble opinion, all I can say is they were good, and went well with the beer.  I'd say this place is good for an out of towner looking for some direction on what local brews are worth your time. Even though we sampled some smaller bits from the menu, I'd also venture to say the mains are probably worth a shot too.  I am sure I'll be back at the Penn Brewery just as soon as I breeze back through my favorite drinking city on the map.",

It is called happy hour.   Honestly, things were better before the new drink tax--somehow, a 10 percent tax resulted in nearly a 17 percent price increase. But, regardless, I can't stop going. Every Monday - Thursday, from 5 - 7PM, there are specials.   While the website still says that you can get at 22 oz. Penn Weizen on Wednesdays (\"Weizen Wednesday!\"), the last time we were there, we were charged $3.50.   If you're not looking to spend a lot of money, but still want something to eat, an order of Goulash and a side of bread is enough to feed at least three people. Think of it as a gourmet chips and dip.   Perhaps the best part, however, is the entertainment. Where else can you watch grown men in lederhosen play music and sing while you drink a huge beer?  Until I came here, I thought beer chants were something from the Man Show.",

The pierogis didn't have much flavor and the kielbasa was tasty, but had little flavor unless it was dipped in the spicy mustard.  The Schnitzel was fine. Not bad but not really good. The spatzle was fine. Our waitress was nice, seemed a bit overwhelmed but was constantly refilling drinks and running around. Overall the food was mediocre.

Sauerkraut was sweet, but good and hubby said it was how his mom made it!  Now I know!  Having it on different levels I guess is a challenge, but really it was people sitting around drinking and talking.  There was a band (wearing their Steelers gear!), but all in all kind of boring.  We were there around 5-ish so I'm sure later in the evening it would get more raucous, but again, with the different levels you kind of lose the \"fest\" part of it and there wasn't any sort of decorations or banners or anything.  Even the people working were just in jeans and t-shirts.  I looked inside at their menu, which looked good and filling, but the decor of the restaurant wasn't anything that would make me eat inside.  The beer was ok, nothing special.  The Penn Gold was meh, the Penn Dark was meh.",

Our server was quite busy (I think the restaurant was short staffed that particular evening). She did her best but often times we waited long periods for drink refills, our appetizers were forgotten to be rung in, there wasn't any silverware on the table so we had to flag down the hostess just to get something to eat with, and it took awhile to have our credit card processed and returned. We waited over a hour to get our food. The restaurant didn't seem that busy but obviously the kitchen was backed up. I understand things like this happen and we weren't in that much of a hurry but the food wasn't worth the wait. We ordered dessert because according to others, they have great desserts - well, the apple turnover was dry and the cookies were stale. No one was impressed. Might go back just to try the different beer selection, but will definitely eat elsewhere prior.",

I sat at a table right near the glass separating the eating area and the fermenting tanks.  Very cool view there.  I forgot what I ordered, specifically, although I do know it was some sort of sandwich.  The fries here were awesome and so was the Penn-Weizen!  I had a 22oz glass and almost ordered another, but sadly declined because I had to leave quickly after eating.  The view of the brewery is pretty sick once you arrive.  It almost looks sketchy at night, but that's just because it has an old warehouse look to it and I walked down the alleyway to enter the brewery.",

    "text": "Recently took our family and son's college friends- there were 12 of us- to Penn Brewery on a Saturday night. Had originally planned on going to Hofbrau Haus, but the wait was over an hour long. So we decided to try Penn Brewery. We were immediately seated, which was great. The food was pretty good. The beer also good, but even my 21 year old son commented on the plastic cups they served the beer in. At Hofbrau Haus you are served beer in authentic Hofbrau Haus glasses. I felt like I was at a frat party drinking out of plastic- c'mon, really? And the music! Yuck! It was a hack singer/guitar player singing cover songs. We wanted a german experience, and ended up feeling like we had just been at a college town bar somewhere in the middle of nowhere. The horrible music was so loud we couldn't even hear ourselves talk, which was the main reason we wanted to go out to dinner. We complained twice to management about the loud music, and apparently they don't care what paying customers think. We rushed through dinner because our eardrums were starting to ring. I literally had buzzing in my ears for the next 24 hours from the excessive volume of the music. The whole vibe of the place felt like a dirty frat house- the lower dining level and bathrooms were really dumpy and in need of a makeover. even my son's friends commented on how dumpy it was- so you know it's bad. Overall, the food and beer were good, but don't go there expecting to actually be able to carry on a conversation or hear authentic german music. Spent $270 here and regretted that  we hadn't waited for a table at Hofbrau Haus. I emailed the manager about our experience, and never heard back- I guess they don't care what their customers think. Oh well. We won't go back.",

Better service would have increased our enjoyment of this brewery.  The food was much better than the beer.  I had the filet served over noodles and my husband the sausage platter with German potato salad.  I thought mine was very good and he absolutely loved his.  The prices for the meals were reasonable.

My wife and I had the fish n'chips while the kids tried the pub burgers. We all thought the food was above average.   The portion sizes were large and tasty, and we all left feeling quite satisfied. The atmosphere was nice, considering the outside of the buidling - they've got a clean open restaurant that we really felt comfortable in.   The staff was all pretty hospitable, too. The only complaint is that when I asked about drinks, the waiter had to explain that every beer on the bottom half of the menu was out.    I understand a craft brewery having times when a particular brew will sell out or be replaced by a seasonal, but HALF THE MENU?   Let's be honest - I'm here for the beer.  I don't care a bit about your food, folks.   Even still, I found beer to drink, and it was a tasty Pils.  The lack of selection is all that kept these folks from getting my 5 star review.",

So, the thing I can talk about: the beer. DEE-lish! But, really, were we expecting anything less? I hear this place has a great Oktoberfest celebration (at the end of September mind you) and I'm going to have to make a special trip back for that. The Weisen is pretty fantastic, I totally recommend that.  Then there was the food. The happy hour special was half off apps, so that's what I got. Unfortunately I was not a fan. I'm not sure if it's because I didn't really want an app (I wanted food food) but I got it anyway cause it was on special (I'm always looking for a deal - in fact, I might have to change my nickname here to that!). So I got the chicken tenders and pretzels with beer cheese and honey mustard. None of it was really appetizing. Mainly, I can't eat the pretzels but I had a small bite and it tasted pretty awesome. If I could eat bread, I'd probably just have gotten that.  I should have gotten the pierogies. My friend got the dessert - pumpkin pierogies (seasonal only) - and I had a taste...omfg. DEE-lish! Topped with whipped cream and toasted nuts. If you're around and they have it, save room. oh. I think I just drooled on myself a little...  I took a quick trip to the restrooms (I mean, I was drinking a lot!) and I saw other tables' food orders and it all looked good. I will definitely be going back again (not just because there's a cute boy that lives within walking distance!) but because I HAVE to go try their food.",

Their beers are delicious and highly recommend the Oktoberfest-a great fall beer.  Their Pumpkin Roll Ale is going to be released starting in mid October and I am looking forward to trying this new brew.  It rained the entire night for Oktoberfest but with the tents in the parking lot we were lucky to stay dry. We ate outside instead of insideso we did not order off the regular menu. The outdoor food choices were limited but what they did serve was tasty and perfect with the Oktoberfest. I highly recommend the German potato salad-one of my favorites since it isn't mayonnaise based. I also tried the pulled pork sandwich and bratwurst which was equally as good.  If you do decide to go to Oktoberfest (usually held the last two weeks in September) go early to get a table and beat the crowds.  Parking is very limited so this will ensure a good spot.",

    "text": "After trying their Oktoberfest (and thoroughly enjoying it) at other Pittsburgh locations, my family and I decided to come and check out the Penn Brewery for an afternoon feast and some brews. Shockingly, they were completely out of their Oktoberfest and it was only early October. (And yes I am completely aware that Oktoberfest traditionally takes place in September not October, but totally not my point). The fact is, if you're an established brewery you should know how much to brew of your seasonals as to satisfy the masses well into the fall months.  We ended up doing a flight of 9 of their other beers. I particularly enjoyed the Penn Pilsner and Penn Dark but was not very impressed by many of their others. However, I'm not a huge fan of hops and high gravity beers and their were quite a few of these on the flight. However, in my mind since I've tried both their Oktoberfest and their seasonal St. Nikolaus Bock (also phenomenal) their beer is still pretty stellar in my opinion.  We ended up getting a bunch of different things and sharing them for lunch. We had the traditional pierogi platter, the potato pancakes, the goulash soup, a side of spatzle, several sides of German potato salad, and the schnitzel sandwich. I was particularly impressed with the German potato salad, which was served warm and was absolutely delicious. The schnitzel sandwich was also excellent. It was a breaded pork cutlet, served with grilled peppers, onions, and mushrooms, and topped with a vinegar slaw, Swiss cheese, and Dijon mustard.   Sadly, the day was rainy and we weren't able to enjoy the outdoor courtyard. However, sitting on the large wooden benches with a view of the brewing system through a large glass window was wonderful.  I would certainly recommend checking this place out!",

After 7 minutes and not being helped, despite 3 servers + a bartender, I walked to the bar and asked the bartender if we could order from him or if someone was coming to the table. He said someone would be there in a minute. 5 minutes later, timed btw, not one person came up to us, yet checked on various tables to see if people who already had placed orders or had food were ok. The bartender knew we were waiting, saw multiple servers come up to the bar, and said nothing. Sorry, but 12 minutes to wait for sometime to come by a table for a couple of beers is absolutely ridiculous. As we walked out, we passed one of the servers who didn't even acknowledge us, even though she had seen us waiting there. This place should be ashamed of its unbelievably poor customer service. Truly appalling. Have a great beer somewhere at the strip and skip this brewery.",

We were there on a Saturday afternoon, and it wasn't particularly crowded. There was no wait for a table, so we got seated right away and ordered a sampler of all the beers they had on tap that day. I think there were six of them that we sampled. Honestly, most of the beers were not particularly memorable, except for the Nut Roll Ale. This beer was pretty much the reason I wanted to try Penn Brewery, and it didn't disappoint. It was a nice, flavorful, aromatic brown ale, and it did indeed smell like your grandma's nut rolls. Perfect.  Unfortunately, nothing else was even close to perfect. The buffalo chicken pierogi ($6.95) were pretty good, but I prefer the traditional potato and cheese laden pierogi. We also ordered the beer cheese and crackers as an appetizer, but were brought a soup by accident. Our waitress was kind of a hot mess, and even after realizing the mistake, it took a good long while before it was corrected, and an even longer while before she eventually brought the check. Iffy service is not something that usually bothers me. I figure, restaurants/bars are busy, the waitstaff have a lot of crap going on, and it's gotta be a long day on your feet. But the service at Penn Brewery was SO beyond iffy that it's hard to even describe. Several times we were convinced that the waitress had forgotten we were there. For example, she would promise to bring out utensils which had been previously forgotten, and then she would disappear for 15 minutes, leaving our food to get cold while we waited semi-patiently for a fork.  Bottom line: The beer was good, the food average, at best, but the service was just awful. Hopefully this was an anomaly.",

I liked my meal - the Kasespaetzle, but it was not authentic. It was just little noodle dumplings in a creamy macaroni and cheese sauce. It was delicious, but I wouldn't call it German food and my boyfriend didn't like it. He had the Schweinebraten, which was okay. He found the sauerkraut to be unappetizing and I don't remember what beer we ordered, but it tasted like the bottom of the keg. It tasted nearly skunked. Gross. We will probably come back and hopefully get beer that isn't on its last legs. It's cool that you can see the brewery through the windows.",

I was actually glad to wait for a table, so the hubby and I could enjoy the show.  The beers were good, and I especially recommend the Marzen and Bock.  Seating is family style, so you'll likely be seated next to strangers if the place is busy.  We like meeting new people, so talking it up with our table-mates and listening to the band made it feel like a party.  A party with 5 different types of wusrt, that is!  I highly recommend starting with the KASE kugel mit speck, which is basically German mac and cheese. Topped with bacon.  Oh yeah.  I'm looking forward to their Mardi Gras celebration!",

I got awesome pictures of the old Hienz factory and steam stacks from the stoop. The outside of the brew house also set my expectations high; the historic site is complimented by a cute patio/bar area with twinkle lights and cafe-style umbrella tables. Unfortunately, our inside experience was less then impressive. Despite the small crowd, the bartender was inattentive and distracted. We had to request water three times and place our flight order twice. Out of our six pours, my favorites were Tangerine Swirl, Cheater Juice and the Penn Weizen.",

    "text": "This microbrewery had an amazing concept. The building used to be the former Eberhardt and Ober Brewery (founded in 1848). You walk in and you can see so much history. We walked in by mistake to the alley and it looked like a Spanish bodega. The ambiance was so relaxed. Food is amazing....German inspired comfort food and German style beers. We had two beers. Of the two, one that stood out was the Penn Weizen. It's a wheat beer with yeast that produces a unique flavor of banana and cloves with a dry and tart edge, some spiciness, and notes of apples....a little hoppy bitterness, and a moderate level of alcohol. It was amazing. The Penn IPA was right there with hop-forward flavor notes. Overall, I would come back here whenever I'm in Pittsburgh.",

We got a table in the main dining room and luckily not at one of the picnic style tables.   To drink - I ordered the Penn Weizen - it was delicious and I might have ordered a second .  My dad got the Penn IPA, but didn't enjoy it - so he got the Penn Gold instead.   For an appetizer- we ordered the pretzels (they come by 4 an order) so perfect for sharing. However, the last pretzel was under cooked. We reported it to our waitress (and fortunately the manager was able to take of the pretzels on our bill).   For dinner - I ordered the pretzel crusted cod sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was on a Breadworks roll. I enjoyed it very much and may have eaten it all. I would definitely get it again.   Heads up - trivia starts at 8pm on Monday's, but they play in the downstairs beer hall.",

    "text": "Penn Brewery has been a staple in Pittsburgh for a long time (1986 to be exact). While lots of other breweries have been popping up in Pittsburgh Penn has always stood its ground and continued to keep its character. Penn is in the Deutschtown district of Pittsburgh (North Side) and started its journey doing what I feel they still do the best and thats brewing authentic German style beers. In the past few years Penn has expanded their brewing abilities to add IPA's and seasonal beers to their list.    The atmosphere at Penn Brewery is great. They are located in an old nineteenth century brick building with an awesome biergarten located within it's walls. They offer both upstairs and downstairs seating with views of the brewing process.   Penn also offers one of the best Pittsburgh style restaurants in the city. The restaurant offers many authentic German old world dishes like schnitzel, Wurst, strudel etc. They also offer an extensive menu of Burgers, Sandwiches, Salads (with fries of course), and vegetarian offerings.     Overall Penn Brewery is a major part of the city of Pittsburgh and has what you are looking for in a great brewery. As far as i'm concerned Penn Brewery keeps the old Pittsburgh feel we all love alive and well while continuing to serve great beers and food. A must stop while exploring the city or hanging out with friends and family.",

The interior is in the style of a German beer hall with long tables with benches and also seating at the bar.   They have some year round beer selections which are similar to the choices you would have at a German beer hall. There's a light beer, a dark beer and a Hefeweizen. I got the dark beer. It was excellent and tasted quite similar to the beers I have had when visiting Germany. The taste was very clean and refreshing. They also have some seasonal beers and IPAs but it seems better to stick with their specialities.   Their menu was fairly large and I decided to get the German Reuben. It was a little pricey at $14 but was worth it. It had very moist and tasty warm sausage slices and warm red cabbage between pumpernickel bread. The only thing I didn't like so much was the hot potato salad because of the sweet glaze.   The interior has a nice dark ambience with a large screen and smaller screen behind the bar that was playing a soccer game. I also saw a very nice outdoor patio.   I'd definitely recommend a visit here if you're a fan of German beers and food.",

I personally like the standard rotation but the seasonal and specialty were tasty enough.  The Seasonals seemed to be on the creative side, so I felt they weren't fine-tuned to where they could be...  room to develop.    But the food was sensational.  Missus and I split one of the meat and cheese boards.  Yum. Homemade pickles were some of the best ever. Meat and cheese selection was a huge variety, and our portion of food could have fed a family of four. I'll tell you, it was fantastic by both our opinions.   Overall a great experience with great food and friendly folks behind and around the bar.  Atmosphere is a big plus. All the best,",

The oyster-based beer was by far the most surprisingly good, and the chocolate stout was my fav.  And the food, THE FOOD!  I was shocked to even find many yummy Vegan friendly options!  We settled on the house-made soft pretzels and cheese, and were not disappointed.  I'm so sad my snobbery kept me from this delightful gem all these years.

Unfortunately, some of the newer breweries are better and more unique.   I found the beers to be ok.  We sampled a few and I settled on the tangerine swirl.  The taste was light and very drinkable, but I could barely taste the tangerine.  My parter got the ginger beer, which was pretty good.  Not too spicy and didn't have that sting that some ginger beers give off.  We got the pretzels to try and they were DELISH.  I wish I had more things to dip in the cheese spread thing (forget what it was called but it had cream cheese and a hint of spice and was )   I would come back with friends, it's just not at the top of my list of breweries.",

The kielbasa was hot and juicy. The skin had a good texture, but was sometimes a bit tough to bite through. The kraut was a bit bland on its own. Mustard had a good spice. The German potato salad is in a thick glaze that is quite sweet. When I scraped off half the glaze, it was pretty good.   The Penn IPA was pretty mild, not too hoppy or bitter like I expect. The Cheater Juice was more what I was looking for.",

    "text": "We were visiting from out of town with friends and we looked forward to coming to Penn Brewery for dinner on a Saturday night. The food menu looked great, decent yelp reviews, what could go wrong? We took a $10 Lyft only to find out that they were not taking names for seating but we could stay and wait for a table to open up. Let me explain why that's an awful idea: - People enjoying their evening at a table are constantly being stared at, making them uncomfortable  - People waiting for a table are forced to hover over other patrons - There was a crowd of about 15-20 people all waiting for tables, consolidated near the bar the blocking the waitresses path to the kitchen - There's no guarantee you'll get a table or how quickly - No organization to the chaos  I understand the thought process, it's a lot on a hostess on a busy night to manage a crowd like that. But with the alternative making all patrons feel uncomfortable, that's a quick way to lose business.",

Lots of salt but just tapped some of it off. Then I had the Rachel which is a lighter version of a Rueben... it was done perfectly on breadworks marble.

    "text": "WOW. What happened to this place?!?! It WAS one of my favorites.  Apparently a change in chef is partly to blame. He apparently has a thing for muenster cheese. This in turn has also produced a change in the menu - neither for the better.  My old standby was the Kielbasa Rueben, which is now the \"German\" Rueben. Which apparently means it can't have a potato pancake, sauerkraut, swiss cheese, or Russian dressing. It now comes with braised red cabbage, muenster cheese, and hot bacon dressing....a step down after sampling. The \"Northsliders\" from the app. menu are now also gone.   One 'positive' about the menu is that it seems everything on it is now available all day as opposed to having separate lunch and dinner menus.   Visiting on a GORGEOUS Saturday afternoon, like any normal person I wanted to dine al fresco. Nope, patio not open until 4. Whaaa? Ok whatever.   Tried the sausage platter and intended to try the Deutschtown burger.   Unfortunately since I only said 'burger' when I ordered I just got the basic or classic burger. Who orders one of those anyway unless it's on a kid's menu? I'll take the hit for that I guess, I should have been more clear. But apparently ordering it with no bun also means you don't get pickles or mustard. It was fine, but it sure isn't worth $10.   Same story with the sausage platter. $15 for 3 pieces of sausage? Where the only skill involved in preparing it is turning on the burner. And what kind of kielbasa is that? Not anything I grew up eating.   Disappointed in the changes....but at least the beer is still good!",

That being said I was very excited to go to the brewery and have some good German food and beer.  We were seated very quickly and the waitress was nice, but said a guy who was busy would be our waiter....seems that didn't happen as she came right back to take our order.  We order a brezel (Pretzel with beer cheese), and I got a schnitzel sandwich and a Penn lager.  The food came before the appetizer.....guess she was busy too.  The brezel and schnitzel sandwich were fantastic.  The food here is top notch and in my opinion saves this place.  My lager however was awful.  So bitter, I barely got through it.  I decided to get the Octoberfest beer a shot as I tried my girlfriends Penn Gold and thought OK, not great.  The Octoberfest was better, but still awfully bitter and just not very tasty.  I'd go back for the food, but Hofbrau definitely has them on the beer.",

Of the 6 of us who ordered, 4 of us could not get what we wanted because the restaurant had run out. We were informed that they were out of all pierogies(in all varieties), all spaetzle, and vegetarian sausage. We were only informed that the potato and cheese pierogies were out after two people order them.   The wait staff, although trying to be accommodating , seemed a bit over their head and there seemed to be a complete disconnect between the front and back of the house.  When the orders finally arrived, one of the orders was wrong, making 5 out of 6 orders not what people wanted. Keep in mind that this was at 7:30pm, not late night when I would expect a restaurant to run out of food.  The food that did arrive was pretty mediocre. The steak sandwiches were tough and dry. The fries were good. The salads had too much red onion. The potato soup was bland except for being too salty. The appetizers we had were pretty good but the grilled veg that cam with the hummus was cold.  The only thing positive of this visit was that the beer was good.",

Penn Brewery is probably one of the oldest microbreweries/brew pubs around.  I can't vouch for their beers since I'm a non-drinker but their lunches here are really good.  Penn Brewery is meant to emulate a German bierstube and the atmosphere here is just so gosh darn fun, it almost doesn't matter if the food is any good.  Well not quite.  Who wants to eat lousy food?   I can't remember what the others ate, but we did start off with an order of  Penn Brewery beer cheese, flavored with their house brew.  I believe one of my coworkers had the scnitzel sandwich but I went for the sausage baguette--a grilled bratwurst with sauerkraut.  Mmmmm, I love stinky food!  Kiss me Rick, darling!",

Second, although the food was mostly as good as before, the portions were much smaller than what we've had in the past with the same prices.  This was a big let down.  Lastly, we had 3 couples, 3 separate checks and they would only let us use 1 groupon for the entire table.

The service here, however, leaves something to be desired.  On previous visits to Penn Brewery we've enjoyed dining outside and have enjoyed the food. This week, we were excited there was a Craft Beer Week event here and the collaboration beers had the BF all in a tizzy. We made our way there (in rush hour and everything!), parked in the mini garage and made our way inside. Inside, it was a madhouse. The bar was jam packed. The tables were full. The hostess stand was abandoned. We awkwardly stood at the hostess stand since we were hoping to get some food while we were there. No one came, and no one came. When an employee finally came over, it was like he didn't know what a hostess stand was or how to operate said hostess stand. He was confused about what to do, handed us menus and told us we could sit anywhere. We snagged a table from two women who were about to leave and started to look over the menu. After a few minutes and no sign of a waiter, a waiter came over and asked us if we'd been seated here. Yes, we said, we were given menus and told we could sit here. 'Welllll (I'm channeling all three nasal-y Kardashians here), you can't sit here. There's a long wait.' But- b-b-b-b- the man said we could sit here :( 'Yeah, there's a really long wait.' This woman was SO rude. I was immediately peeved. We'd already been ignored, given False information and THEN rudely told to move like we were some sort of aliens trying to jump the 'wait' list. We were not offered to have our name put on the list while we waited at the bar, we were just told to MOVE IT. I looked at this rude waitress, looked at my accomplice, and said, \"CAN WE LEAVE?\" And we did. I tweeted them about it and they said 'We are very sorry about that! We'll let the staff know so we can prevent that in the future.' But what's done is done. And no free app or anything? Fuh-GET about this place and its shenans. If I need a raucous night of German beer drinking I'll head to Hofbrauhaus. Hmph!",

I was pleasantly surprised to see that the place had German food. Yum! We also had a sampler of their beers. Pretty diverse flavors.  We were there on a Saturday afternoon, so it wasn't super crowded. Had a nice casual vibe though. They have a nice patio on the side that must be great on a warm night. They also had a huge party room down on the  first floor.  All around a great stop. I did see that someone mentioned a downtown view. I was excited to see it, but the only downtown view I saw was from inside the elevator. Downtown view not so much. Hit the inclines instead.",

    "text": "This is an excellent example of what a German American brewery should be! They have a beautiful, quaint outdoor beer garden with an old cobblestone courtyard. So much history there, it's almost like taking a step back in time, if only momentarily.   The staff was very hip and cool, in a friendly way. We were seated promptly in the outside beer garden at a bistro table around 5:30 on a Friday night. The menu was very extensive, some of it even being in German. And my inner Canadian rejoiced at the variety of poutine they offered. So of course I had to try it along with a flight of beers. It didn't disappoint! Neither did the soft pretzels or strudel! And the beers were excellent! I can't wait to go back there when I'm in town! Highly recommend! Family friendly, fun for everyone!",

Great service, a bit pricey, but we used a Groupon and it was very affordable.  We were there at 2pm on a Monday.    6/2/2019- Around 2 PM on a Sunday at Penn Brewery. There were four tables occupied. I had the buffalo chicken pierogies, which come with blue cheese crumbles according to the menu, but instead it came with a white sauce that tasted faintly like blue cheese. What a disappointment.  If I'd known they were going to pour a weak blue cheese dressing on the pierogies, I would've said put it on the side. He ordered a bacon cheddar cheeseburger. The bacon was not on the burger. We visited here many times, it must've been an off day. But for the prices and lack of business on this day,  I think things should've gone a little better. We will be back, but next time, I will complain if there's a problem.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time.  We ordered their pretzel breadsticks appetizer, the Wurst platter, their 5hour brisket, and the salted caramel cookie dessert with vanilla ice cream.  What's hot - Cost.  I purchased a $25 Groupon for $13, which was a money saver.  Our total bill came out to around $25, including tip.  This Groupon looks to be regularly offered, as well.  Their wait staff are familiar with it, which is good.  Always great saving money! - Good menu variety.  There are appetizers, cheese spreads, burgers, pizza, sandwiches, etc...  It's a big menu, but there's something for everyone. - Some of the food is good.  Despite my dish, which I mention below, most of the food was decent.  The pretzel breadsticks appetizer is served with a warm cheese, a mustard dip, and some cheesy type of cream cheese dip.  Their mustard has a slight spicy kick at the end, which is cool.  Don't come across very flavorful mustards in most restaurants, so this was a yummy difference.  The salted caramel pretzel cookie dessert was yummers- warm, soft, gooey, and sweet but not too sweet.  What's not - The wait.  First time we came here, the wait was hella long, so we left.  I made sure to make a reservation for the next time.  Based on what I've seen and experienced, dinner times are busy, so make a reservation.  Their dining area is kinda small and not spread out, so be prepared.   -  Bland food.  My food (the brisket) was bland.  The Vietnamese sausage wasn't flavorful and the German dumplings were bland, too.  The brisket was tender and moist, but no flavor.  Dudes, I asked for hot sauce!  My point- be aware that not everything on their menu is flavorful and yummy.  You should probably ask the wait staff for their feedback if flavor is an issue for you, like it is for me.  The menu also said my dish came with bean sprouts and root vegetables.  No bean sprouts.  What were the root vegetables?  Carrots and celery. - Cost.  Despite my Groupon, not everything is a reasonable price.  For example, they have pierogis that are $9 for 4 pieces.  That's high- $2 per pierogi?  Really? - Noise.  It gets noisy here pretty fast and it doesn't take much for this place to be crowded.  Be prepared that this place isn't the easiest to socialize and talk, unless it's really the booze you care about. - Parking.  Not the easiest.  They do have a parking garage behind the restaurant, but it's not the easiest to find.  Don't even bother looking for street parking.  It's so limited. - Service.  The wait staff seem to be spread thin, which means it's not always easy to flag someone down when you need something.  Their wait staff aren't rude.  They just don't seem to have enough staff, so service can be slow.  Final answer Willing to come back, but not a first choice.",

We came and had a 2 hour wait for a Saturday night so we signed in and went to other breweries in the area while waiting, they called us at our turn so that was cool.   The bench seating area was cool and the whole atmosphere was a very nice vibe - random mixes of different crowds dancing together to the band. I would say the whole environment and music are the best things about this place.   The beer selection was seriously lacking to me for a popular brewery. Maybe it's just me but I expected more specialty beers, given the hype. The food we got was decent but nothing spectacular. We came for the halfway to Octoberfest menu - pretzel appetizers, wing plates, sausage platters, ruebens - we got a mix of different dishes and shared them all. The service was very prompt and excellent. It's a cool place to checkout, especially for out of town friends, but the drinks and food were nothing special in my opinion.",

The \"eh\": Feels like a chain. Beer taste more like mega-brewery than craft. 8 years ago I would have loved this place.... the explosion of great little craft breweries has just kind of passed it by on the brewery scene. That being said, if you enjoy big box restaurants you will probably really enjoy a trip here..... it does have a fun vibe. Drink local!",

This place is good for large groups, there were many there last night. Happy hour runs from 4 until 6, they had some decent specials. Their Penn Weizen is my favorite beer they have. Our service tonight was great. The food was very good too, I went with the burger which was great with the beer. My one hesitation here is the prices, things are perhaps a bit overpriced. I also was charged $1 for cheese on the burger despite the menu not saying this -- not anything life-changing but still. I ordered the pierogis to go for someone and they did not really like them and thought for $9 they were not worth it. Overall, a solid place to check out in Pittsburgh, especially for those visiting.",

Having been to the brewery in the North Side many times I found it to be consistent.  The food was good and I think Penn has decent beer. Service was good at the airport which is key when you need to eat and pay relatively quickly at times to catch a flight.  The tables are a bit crammed together but then again it's the airport.  All in all I think it's a good addition and will plan to stop again while waiting for a flight.    I have also always enjoyed the Oktoberfest weekends at the North Side brewery and recommend that, usually occurs in mid to late September each year.

    "text": "Penn Brewery is a historical place as they are housed in the historic Eberhardt and Ober Brewery building. The abundance of historical value in the building and brewery is incredible from were there brewing is done to the caves that houses the casks of beer.   Food If you are looking for AUTHENTIC german cuisine this is not the place, but the food is good. I've had the jagerschitzel and kaissespatzel and have to say they are not bad at all. They have flavor but the jagersnitzel is a tad dry.   Beer This is where the brewery shines, from their seasonal beers (you have to go to the tapping the cask parties), to their normal weissens and stouts. All around the beers have great taste and aromas. No two are alike either. In the off-season (November to January) they always experiment with new flavors for the next year.  Atmosphere Great family atmosphere, but it does get a tad loud during the night or during Oktoberfest, but the service is good and the people there genuinely seem like they like it there.  Overall, Food is mediocre, but the Beer is awesome.",

    "text": "My partner, kids, and I decided to finally check out Penn Brewery after living in the neighborhood for nearly a year but seeming to never get ourselves down there until now. It was busy but we got a table right away and were served by Justin, who was really nice and gave us great service.  We started with the Butcher Plate, a charcuterie that offered meats, cheese, pickled items, bread, and a nice swipe of spicy mustard; we got the smaller size board which was still plenty of food for two people. Everything on it was delicious.  We each decided to grab some beers; I went for the Penn Weizen, which is a favorite of mine, and my partner decided to try a Weizenbock. He ended up ordering another, so I imagine he liked it. I took a sip and it wasn't as strong tasting as I was expecting based on the color, which for my taste preferences was a good thing. The Penn Weizen is -delicious-; it's missing that light banana aftertaste that a lot of Hefeweizens have, and I am perfectly ok with that since it's plenty flavorful and aromatic.  For dinner, the kid's menu had plenty to offer our picky eaters. My daughter got a cheeseburger and fruit cup, which she devoured. My son got the cheese pizza which was a pretty generous serving. My partner got the Schweinebraten, and while he did enjoy it, he said he may have preferred something else since it kind of seemed like a pork chop type meal that I have made at home before. I got the sausage platter which I really enjoyed; each sausage had a unique flavor and texture, none too spicy or too bland. The kraut is better at Hofbrauhaus but Penn's was perfectly fine. The warm German potato salad was delicious and almost had a taste of honey to it.  Overall we had a great experience, and being that we live a mere 5 minutes up the hill, we plan to make more trips to Penn Brewery in the future, even if just for some beers and the Butcher Board.",

    "text": "Ok came here on a Friday during rush hour and a Pirates game so we had a bit of traffic around exit 1D. Once we got here I saw a lot of no parking signs and a lot of people ignoring them, so I hopped out of the car to ask the girl at the check-in table at the bier garten entrance where I should park. I expected to hear something like \"anywhere - they don't enforce after 5\" or directions to a lot. Nope she answered with complete bewilderment \"Park?! Wow, I have no idea.\"  One of the stupidest people or she was playing me for a fool, not sure which.   I was determined to find a place to park, though, instead of just going over to El Burro, because I had this Groupon expiring the next day. So I got back in my car and turned left and BAM there's the parking structure - complete with stair access into the bier garten.  A lot of adjectives spewed forth at this point but I'll keep those to myself.   We opted to eat inside instead of outside (because of the heat, not that ditz at the entrance), and were sat right away at a table near the brewery works.  It was pretty loud in there.  To eat, I ordered the schweinebraten. The best part was the broccoli. I think it was the best prepared broccoli I've ever eaten.  It complimented the rest of the dish perfectly. The good part was the mashed potatoes and gravy. It was very tasty - and necessary. The ok part was the pork itself.  It was too dry and bland tasting.  Without the mashed potatoes and gravy, I wouldn't have been able to eat much of it. Frankly I've had better pork roast at the AVI cafeteria at work.    The chocolate stout was great the first 1/3 but after that I found the chocolate flavor to be too much. The weizen, however, I found to be refreshing and elegant. Much better than the Pittsburgh Hofbrau's!  That was my companion's choice, and I liked it enough that I got a 5oz pour as an after-dinner drink to round out the evening.   The mug the chocolate stout came in added to the experience. It was dimpled and had the look of a barrel.   Like the pork, the waitress was also bland (personality-wise) but no complaints with her core function. We would have had another round of beers if she checked back in time. (Asking if we're good as she walks past us without stopping doesn't count.)  I didn't like that she asked to take my companion's phone to the bar to scan the groupon barcode.  I would have said no to that!  Really I want to give them a 3 but these unusual things tonight didn't get in the way of us having a good time so 4 it is.",

    "text": "Finally went here for a friends birthday and found myself intrigued by the menu.   As a plant based advocate I appreciated that they had so many vegan and vegetarian options while also having many of the Pittsburgh staples that are popular in the region.  As for the quality of the food I found it to be a very \"hit or miss\" kind of place. While I loved the BBQ jackfruit sandwiches I wasn't as much a fan of the portabella mushroom \"vegan cheese steak\" sandwhiches. Although I loved the garlic shrimp appetizer I didn't think the fried okra and fried green tomatoes were on that same Caliber.  Since they have such a huge menu I would recommend they cut it in half and only focus on the menu items they are good at executing. Nonetheless, I appreciated the generous portions and the excellent customer service!",

    "text": "I don't know why I haven't visited in all these years - but in the matter of a week I ended up at Penn Brewery twice.   High points: Beer samplers are always great - and with the variety of selection at Penn Brewery, there was plenty to pick from and it was great sharing size. We had the poutine, which was delicious - it was huge though! Way too much for an app for 2 people, so we kind of wish we had just stopped there. We also had the mac & cheese (mostly saved it for left overs) because I really wanted to try their dessert menu.   The location is great - there is a parking garage just up the street that holds a decent amount of vehicles and there is a small amount of street parking near by. There are several picnic style tables, making it a good location for a group - as long as you get there at the right time.  The second visit was just for a beer and some pretzels. We were able to get a 4-top table much earlier than they originally told us to sit as a group rather than huddle around the bar. Good beer - good pretzels. I'd recommend checking it out!",

    "text": "Me and the lady came by here on a Tuesday for \"Fat Tuesday\" we seen they had a event going on featuring a live band so decided to check it out. It was both of our first time here. Not know what to expect we where a bit surprised on the set up. On walking in it seems like a old school and there doors that open up into a seating area. The staff was friendly from the conversation we had noted it was extremely loud with the band playing and hard to hear. We where advised it would be roughly a twenty minute wait we said that was fine. We got note a table was ready a lot sooner if we where okay with sitting at a longer table with other people. We agreed just being so hungry and wanting to sit down. Once seated our server was nice but it was very busy so things where very fast with talking just to get the order in and move on to someone else. I settled with the po boy for the limited special menu they had for the event and She got a chicken salad. We started with the pretzel appetizer just to have something to snack on in the mean time. The pretzels where good but the dips where much better and made it go well together. The pretzels by there selfs where very boring. As for the po boy it was a major disappointment. There was hardly any shrimp on it and it was missing the house made pickles on the actual sandwich. It was a okay dish but nothing to hype up. On top of that the server said any side was included in the dish so I got the Mac and cheese and that was great. But when the bill came it ended up being a up charge of six dollars if I remember correctly. I don't mind paying for it but to not know the menu to inform guest is a big issue. My date enjoyed her salad but that's pretty hard to mess up. Overall I would return down the road on a less busy night to try the other menu when things are less hectic. This was just a huge let down on something I was really looking forward to because this event and the food could have been so much better.",

Compared to many of the other breweries popping up in the area, they have very few beers on tap and not a very wide range of beer styles. I had the seasonal (I think an Oktoberfest) and it was OK.  The atmosphere was dark and pretty crowded at the bar, but the restaurant area was more open (though not any brighter).   I would return to try the food because I've heard good things, but I wasn't impressed by their beers (and they're a brewery!)",

Even being seated far from the boisterous, large party, my companion and I had to raise our voices to be heard as the acoustics are awful with no carpeting. Do not dine here unless you are willing to deal with a lot of noise. The food is excellent.  Her gyro and my jaegerschnitzel with brown gravy were delicious and the portions ample.  The accompanying french fries and mashed potatoes were top-notch. No bread was brought or offered. I did not realize that my beer sampler was a hefty $17, but for ten decent size glasses, the price was fair.  If one person were to consume all of it, they would likely stagger out of the establishment.  Apple strudel with cinnamon ice cream was the perfect ending.  The meal was $61+ for two plus tip.",

This is what we ordered  The bloomfield flatbread pizza- I'm a fan of goat cheese, so i thought this was really good. The buffalo chicken pierogi- This was delicious.  It seems like you can't go anywhere in Pittsburgh with out seeing a buffalo chicken something these days.  This was a pleasant surprise. veggie burger- not the best veggie burger I've had.  It was sort of dry, with chunks of corn and red pepper (i think it was red pepper).  it's not served with mayo, mustard, hummus spread or anything as a condiment for the burger.  The waitress didn't ask, so I assumed it came with something...but for the price, I shouldn't really complain.  It came with fries, that were super good.  Perfectly salted, skin on fries that were cooked crispy.  Yum! Pretzal w/ beer cheese- carbs and cheese...no complaints here!  I enjoy the Penn Brewery Beers.  I've had the pilsner, gold and dark.  All 3 are easy to drink and tasty.  The service there seems to allow you to enjoy your meal and drinks.  It's feels like a communial, social, gathering place.  The staff isn't bothering you a million times while you eat.  Overall, I liked the place, and would recommend it.  We didn't have any entrees, so I'm not sure how those dishes are but our appetizers and flatbread were worth trying.",

    "text": "4.5 Stars. It's been years since my first visit to Penn Brewery, so I wanted to refresh my memory while I was back in the area. First, it's not in the most convenient location up on Troy Hill, but still pretty easy to get to from either Route 28 or I-279. Parking is a little on the rough side, in a gravel lot across the street. That's apparently an issue for some, but I could care less...it's free! Can't say that about very many places in the city.  After walking through the courtyard and walking up the stairs, I noticed the lunchtime crowd wasn't too busy. I read through the Penn Brew drafts listed on the chalkboard behind the bar and decided to try the Penn Dark (of course). The I looked at the menu and saw this:  \"Bacon Brew Dog: A natural-casing hot dog stuffed with fresh jalapenos, wrapped in bacon, then deep-fried and topped with BBQ sauce, shredded cheddar Jack cheese, and vinegar slaw in a hot dog bun.\"  SAY WHAT!?  I told the bartender that's what I wanted and he grinned and said \"Oh, those are really good. I haven't had one in awhile. Nice choice.\"  Long story short, it was awesome! I probably could've eaten two of them, albeit I would've paid the price for it dearly later on. The friendly bartender also let me sample some of the other brews, including Penndemonium (Brewer's Choice Series) and Summer Berry Weiss (seasonal), both smooth, refreshing and sweet.  I'm very happy I revisited Pittsburgh largest and oldest brewery, but slightly bummed I missed out on their $3 Happy Hour drafts. Good thing to remember for next time.",

It's an excellent business model to get good reviews, but quite awful if you have any interest in making money.  However, I have been here before, and it's really cool in just about every way.  The coolest being was that it was an actual Civil War era brewery apparently, and has a bunch of secret catacombs that they used to store ingredients, and quite possibly, dead bodies.  You can schedule a little mini-tour of the brewery, which is pretty cool as well.  The food is good to very good, and the beer is really awesome.    The only bad thing is parking.  There is an attached garage, so if you make it in there, you're safe.  If you don't there's a terrible unpaved, unmarked lot that takes you across a street that has a blind curve and cars driving a million miles an hour.  I lost many frogs trying to get across that road, and my heart aches for each of my dead friends.  But we did make it across eventually and had a wonderful time.",

Penn Brewery is a great place for a stick to your ribs meal in the winter and their Biergarten is wonderful for kicking back with a pint and relaxing with friends in warmer weather. It is waaaay more than just a place to celebrate Oktoberfest (but of course those festivities should not be missed either.)",

    "text": "Penn brewery has improved immensely, now that they've abandoned their \"German Purity Law\" brewing roots.  They are now brewing good, experimental beers as well as their usual house beers. Every month when I've stopped in, they've had something new.   For those of you out of town, Penn is somewhat of a Pittsburgh success story.  They had a rough time a few years back, but the original owner bought back the company and reopened the brew-pub (they were contract brewing for a short while.)  The actual building itself is really cool, and during the summer the outdoor beer garden is open...it sort of feels like you're sitting in an old castle...not too many places where you'd get that feeling in Pittsburgh.    I've eaten here a few times, and while I'm definitely not blown away by the food, it's decent, and it of course goes great with their beer.  They have large portion sizes so don't order too much.  Their hot potato salad, although a little odd, is surprisingly addicting.    Happy hour here is worth mentioning as well . Beers are $3, apps are half price, and on Thursday they do \"Beers & Brats\" with $5 brats.  I'd go to Penn over Church Sucksworks any day of the week.",

If there's an Oompah band playing in the background, that just enhances the experience. Their schweinebraten is quite tasty but the Jaeger has my heart. I've ordered that dish in Germany & Austria and Penn's version compares favorably.   Beer and atmosphere here are really fun & cool. Love the outdoor brick courtyard & I especially enjoy when we get seated in the cellar. It's a more intimate space than upstairs which has more of a beer hall atmosphere. I'm not a huge fan of the communal tables on the 1st floor unless you go there with your own big group. Not as much fun with just 2 people.  Penn Brewery is truly a Pittsburgh institution and fortunately when you find one of their beers you like, you can typically find them at a local distributor. We've bought Oktoberfest nearly year round.",

I've now made this same mistake in every town and city I've been to and Pittsburgh was no different. We stayed at the William Omni hotel and decided to walk to The Penn Brewery. Google Maps says 1.5 miles so really it didn't seem that bad of a walk -- except there's no real good way to get there. We ended up walking through some park where there was a 5k going on. My husband was smoking and half drunk, while these lovely racers were cheering each other on. Embarrassing or what?  Even despite the really extreme walk in super uncomfortable shoes, I loved Penn Brewery. Maybe I loved it more because I had to walk so far to get there.   Although I like to try new foods, I don't think I've ever had German food, so this was my first dabble in that. I went with the stuffed banana peppers for an entree and the potato pancakes to start. Both were equally delicious and left me wanting to try more of this new culinary treat. However, the stuffed peppers were huge and I really had no room left in my stomach for anything else.  Service was phenomenal until we asked for bus directions. Then no one had any clue and told us to use our phones to get back. Ordinarily that's what we do but both of them happened to be dead. So you know what that means. Another 1.5 mile walk back.   So was it worth the 3 mile walk? Abso-lutely and I'd do it all over again if it meant eating some more of those stuffed peppers.",

There was traditional German music, beer (being served in cups and half gallon containers), and food. There was a very wide age range, but everyone was respectful of each other (even with all of the alcohol that was being consumed).   My favorite part of Penn Brewery was the outdoor rooftop patio overlooking the downtown skyline. The ambiance on the reminded me of some of the rooftop bars in New York City.",

Except for having a VIP line to get drinks and food much quicker, it would have been far cheaper to just pay cash for what was included in our package.  The food was mediocre to say the least: pretzels were cold and the sauerkraut and German potato salad had absolutely zero flavor.

VIP Tickets cost us $35 each and that gave us 3 hours (2pm-5pm) of unlimited wings from any of 40 or so Pittsburgh area restaurants/bars.  The cheapest tix were $25 and allowed you in from 3-5pm.  The vendors were great!  The options were awesome.  Some of the flavors were not to our liking (maple syrup/real bacon bit wings anyone?), some wings were undercooked (bloody bones inside anyone?).  But some of the vendors hit it out of the park (Big Shot Bobs dry rub is AWESOME!).  We had all kinds of flavors- Jamaican jerk, Cajun, ghost pepper smoked, and tons more.  The reason I'm only giving this 3 stars is because Penn Brewery 'dropped the ball' in several important areas- The outdoor beer stands were cash only.  Who carries cash anymore?  So we headed indoors only to find their ATM machine OUT OF ORDER!  And to get to the ATM you had to leave the parking lot where the event was held and walk completely around to the front of the building to get in.  The gate separating the lot from the restaurant was padlocked!  Why not open it and put a couple I'd checkers on chairs at the gate???  They then put out a single bottled water machine- up on the top lot IN THE SUN!  Then later on they set up a water table in the lower lot (which was shaded) but the water wasn't even iced.  $35 a person and they can't put ice in the water???  There was also a malfunctioning hand wash station- you step on the pedal and the water squirted out all over your feet.  At least there was soap- which I had to rinse off with water from the drinking water table.  I don't know what management was doing but I'm guessing they were oblivious to the issues.  Or maybe they were just too busy counting their money...  Smh...",

It took 5 days to get from Surf City to Steel City. We arrived at the Inn at the Mexican War Streets, a gothic mansion purchased in the early 80s by the existing owners for $100k, who, later got it appraised to have $100k worth of blood marble in around the fireplace alone. Nonetheless, it's an incredibly luxurious bed and breakfast for a fantastic price and an opportunity to be part of Pittsburgh's rich history.   The mister and I urban hiked to Penn Brewery, and while I don't have much to say about their beers besides being reminiscent of Budweiser, I do have to say their pretzels were delicious. Chewy and soft inside, the outside provided a pleasantly lye ridden crust. The Original Penn Beer Cheese - basically sharp cheddar blended with cream cheese and Penn pilsner - has become a memorable favorite cheese with the husband. I thought it had a nice bite, but nothing too crazy special. For $4.95 for two large pretzels and a good dose to beer cheese, Penn Brewery gets thumbs up for their knot, not for their beer.",

Before you walk in the door you know this is a very unique place in the city. Sitting on Troy Hill this building looks down on historic Deutchetown. The Beer Garden outside is gorgeous cobblestone and a wonderful place to eat in the summer and an even more fun place during Oktoberfest.  The moment the wide wooden doors swing open to reveal the Beer Hall you can't help but admire the beautiful brass brewery equipment peering in through a glass barrier at the charming bar. The long tables call to mind the Prancing Pony and the Green Dragon bringing out my inner nerd.   On my most recent visit I had just finished washing down a delicious soft pretzel with beer cheese and a tall pint of Penn Pilsner when my Cheese steak arrived. I have traveled all over the city looking for the perfect cheesesteak and this is it friends. I have had it more times than I can count and the only plate that can take me away from it is maybe their homemade pierogis.   The prices are extremely reasonable for what you get and the experience is unlike any other this side of the Atlantic. I've never had their mixed drinks but only come here of you like beer.",

You can't beat this fun of an environment. Toss away the generic Hofbrauhaus get to a Pittsburgh legacy! I love the fun German beer hall feel with the large picnic size tables that just beckon you to sit down with an even larger brew!  I love German food, but there's a really good opportunity to screw it up. Have you ever noticed a lot of the colors of German food blend together? Sauerkraut, perogies, mashed taters (is that German? Whatever!), they all look the same! So making them taste good is a must! I'm a big fan of the perogies - a buttery delicious mixture in a lovely little dumpling. While I'm not really a fan of their sauerkraut, it's too sweet for me, I know some people like it that way (I like mine a little on the sour side). Throw in a pretzel with their beer cheese and some grilled kielbasa and I'm one happy German camper!  I'm a fan of their Penn Pilsner and a big big big fan of their special Chocolate Meltdown, which they debuted last Valentines Day. Now I'm telling you right now, you get yourself to Penn Brewery AS SOON as that comes out this year!  The other thing that's awesome about this place is that they throw a ton of events. Nevermind their month long Oktoberfest, they host bands every couple weeks that jam out inside and out. Speaking of which, they have a great outdoor courtyard for sitting with your fave brew!   And to that I say, oh! oh! oh!",

I finally made it there last weekend and was pleased with my visit.  I initially tried to visit last weekend, but it was so packed there was over an hour wait for a table, so we decided to return in the future but with reservations.  I was glad I had made them because even fairly early they were crowded.    They have happy hour specials from 5-7 which include half price appetizers and beer and drink specials.  Because of the specials, we tried the Buffalo chicken pierogies, potato pancakes and the beer cheese.  All were fantastic!  Being from Buffalo, I was especially excited to try the Buffalo Chicken pierogies since I've never had anything like them before.  My only complaint is that they were slightly dry, but the flavor was fantastic.  Entrees were the weinerschnitzel and sausage platter.  Both were very tasty, however my schnitzel was a bit dry (remedied by eating it with bites of the cabbage).  I was going to order it with the sauce, but the server advised it is bitter and almost no one likes it.  I'm glad he gave me the tip, but if no one likes it, you would think they would change the recipe to improve that aspect.  Oh well.  Service was good.  Almost too good in that all of our food came out very quickly.  We had other places to be that evening, so in the scheme of things, it wasn't a bad thing, but to some degree, we almost felt rushed.  Beer was amazing.  Had the nut roll ale and the Christmas blend.  I wish I would have bought some to take home with me.  There will be a return visit.",

The food was excellent breaded very lightly and not tough. It had a nice mushroom sauce on top of the schnitzel. The vegetable was broccoli I think which excellent. Then there was the beer. They brew their own here so I tried an IPA. Very tasty. I sat at the bar and the dining was very casual.",

    "text": "YUM! I've been to Penn Brewery a couple times and have to say, I really, really enjoy eating at this place and I am so glad it's part of Pittsburgh! Well done German food + authentic German beers: what's not to like?  The first time I stopped in was for lunch and I fell in love immediately. The place wasn't hopping but that was fine by me - my dining companion and I had plenty of room to stretch out in their tavern/hall-like dining area as we peered into the brewery and tried remembering which flags on the walls and in the rafters represented which countries. For our meal, we ordered their ginger beer - an excellent brew! - and a specialty veal sandwich (which I wish they'd add to the menu full-time!), amazing pierogies and an absolutely delicious green salad. Seriously, you know you're doing something right when I get super happy about a salad - what's not to like about being able to eat well without giving up taste? This one had smoked pork belly, dried cranberries, mozzarella, and almonds dressed with garlic oil vinegar. Talk about yummy!  My second visit was during dinner hours with a group of friends, and I honestly think I'll be sticking to lunch only visits. The place was much more packed in the evening and once you added in loud music, it was impossible to talk to anyone at my table aside from the person right next to me. Not cool - if I'm out with friends, I want to be able to talk to them. Still, the food was as awesome as ever - we split the fried pickles (quite unusual in this city, I think, but not bad) and I continued my streak of ordering \"healthier\" options here by getting the portobello stack. Given it's price I wouldn't have minded a bit more food on my plate - but it was still VERY good. Well cooked (but not overdone) mushrooms plus tomatoes plus creamy goat cheese and dressing - what a simple but delectable combination. Seeing as I'd eaten beer and pizza at work that day, a dinner of just vegetables sounded perfect, and it's good to know that Penn Brewery's menu isn't entirely comprised of heavy German food, a common sin of restaurants that offer it.  I definitely plan on stopping in to sample more of their sandwiches, appetizers and burgers the next time I want to go out for lunch - just thinking about trying their Deutschtaun Burger and their flatbreads makes my mouth water!",

The menu was disappointing for a vegetarian so I ended up not eating. The staff inside didn't know where to direct us or just didn't care. I get it, they were busy, but their job is to help us enjoy the space.  Negatives aside, the space itself is great. There are tons of areas to explore and relax with good beer. The sound was also well done, and that impressed me.   I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon. It's just not my vibe, and it's pretty far out of the way for drinking and chilling. I strongly recommend supporting them by buying their local beer though, because that's the cool thing to do.",

Do note it's not self seating and it's very easy to walk into the biergarten from the street and not be waited on. The food on the other hand, I find lacking. I ordered beer cheese and macaroni \"I'm a huge fan of bier cheese and pretzels\" but when my dish arrived, the cheese was watered down and seriously lacking in taste. For the price and what I knew from the quality of the beer, I was surprised and disappointed in the food. It's also quite loud inside on the weekends.",

I've also recently discovered their Summer Berry Weiss and enjoyed it so much that I finally purchased a Penn Brewery growler.  They make some pretty tasty German fare here that never disappoints.  My go-to has often been the amazing sausage platter.  On my most recent trip I did a 180 and went for the Beer Garden Burger and could not have been happier with the selection.  I'm far from being a vegetarian, but this burger was something I would definitely eat again.    They also host some awesome events such as their own Oktoberfest, a Brewfest featuring other local/regional offerings and most recently the Northside Sandwich Sampler.  Thursdays during the summer they have the Beer Garden open for cheap drinks and food.    I've been here when it's jam-packed busy and I've been here when I thought they were closed because there were only two other patrons.  Not much of a bar area, but tables both upstairs and down.  Regardless of the time of day or number of other customers, the service, food and beer have always been good.  Drink local.",

The sourness of the salad does need to get use to but it is great to balance the meatiness of the sausages.

My dad had his 50th birthday there, i had my 30th birthday there, the food was great, the music was great, and dont even get me started  about the time i accidentally drank an entire gallon of beer at Oktoberfest bc they were serving the beer in half gallon jugs and after you drink half a gallon of beer, it seems like a good idea to have another!  (I had a DD).  Its under new management and only the location is still the same.  And the beer.  So I might be back for Oktober fest only, this time sticking to half a half a gallon.    How changed is my beloved German restaurant?  Four words.  Dave Matthews Cover Band.  WTF.    If I ever come back for food, it wont be on a Saturday night.  Because of nostalgia I've tried this place three times, but due to my schedule its unfortunately been on a Saturday night which is apparently \"Bands that sound like your sitting in a dorm room listening to your crush play guitar and sing but he cant sing and hes just learning guitar but you prentend to like it anyway\" night.  Who the hell is their booker?  Why is it SO DAMN LOUD in the bar I couldn't talk to my friend, instead we kind of sat there and watched the beer ripple in our glasses.  The accoustics are equally bad upstairs and downstairs.  Its terrible.  If you must keep the same music booker, can you PLEASE have your bands turn the volume down, just a little.  And for the record, I love music.  But it's quieter at Stage AE.  its just assinine.    Since youre not going to be able to HEAR or TALK to your dining companions, you can look forward to the food which is just slightly better than ok.  The schnitzel is pretty good, but I dont know why this restaurant even tries to maintain that they are a german restaurant.  Why not just become a brew pub, and have a menu with really good bar food?  This place is a disappointment.  But theres really good beer here, and that makes it worth it to check it out one lsat time before realizing its just never going to be the same restaurant it once was.",

Incredibly loud music that sounded like top 40 country radio played over the speakers, which isn't the sort of atmosphere I want if I'm going to a German style brew pub. My saurbraten was very tough. The pretzel appetizers were OK but were typical chain style food and overpriced for the quality. The server didn't inquire how anything was and generally seemed annoyed to be there.
