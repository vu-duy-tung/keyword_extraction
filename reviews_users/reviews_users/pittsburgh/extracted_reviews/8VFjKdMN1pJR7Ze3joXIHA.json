    "text": "Rowdy BBQ! First time here, and was pretty happy with my experience. I like this place for a number of reasons not just the food. This BBQ stand stays open year round with no indoor seating. It is essentially carryout no frills type of place. Which is in my opinion great because that says to me \" let our food talk for us, we don't need all that fancy pants stuff!\" I was greated by a extremely friendly lady that had a smile on her face and had no problem answering my barrage of questions about the place. I'll tell you what, before I even order I knew that my meal would be more than satisfactory with such a great personality. I kept it simple for my first experience and ordered pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw. The pork was flavorful and I'm a saucy type of person so, I doused it with some additional sauce which made this a tasty samich. I can't remember what I was charged for this lunch combo but it was a definitely a deal.",

My 13yr old daughter is a very picky eater, and she loves the ribs and mac n cheese (I don't do cheese, so I can't rate that myself). The BBQ sauce has a nice smokey flavor, but it's not overpowering. The ribs and chicken pretty much fall right off the bone. Extremely juicy and great flavor. I would, and do, recommend this place to friends.",

We had the brisket and the pulled pork. They were equally delicious. Perfectly cooked and tender, they both had very different flavors. The pork was slightly sweeter and the brisket was a little peppery. For people who are complaining about the sauce level, why didn't you just ask for light sauce? Clearly, it is not being dumped out of a bucket in the back room...appreciate that people in different parts of the country eat things many different ways. We also had the fried pierogies which were tasty and crispy and could only have been improved with the addition of sour cream. We'll be back on our next visit to Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "Fairly decent barbecue in the 'Burgh. The ribs are properly smoked and quite tender, with a rather indistinct rub...I got a little chili powder taste from it, plus a bit of garlic, but not much else. They offer two barbecue sauces, which is actually just one, as they simply add cayenne to the house sauce to make it more spicy. The baked beans were very tasty, a nice blend of navy beans, black beans and kidney beans flavored lightly enough that I could actually taste the beans, which I appreciate. The fries are also very good, with a nice potato flavor that lets you know they're freshly made. I'm not doing handstands, but I'll go back and try more. I skipped the pulled pork, as I like mine with the traditional North Carolina vinegar sauce, and theirs comes with the house barbecue sauce...one I don't really like. The chicken was OK, but not smokey or unctuous enough for me to rave about. Again, I'll go back and try more.",

It was a sunny day, great because your only choice is sitting outside. While we waited 5-10 minutes for our food, we partook of the very very clean porty-potty out back. The road can be noisy, so I'd recommending not choosing the tables by the road unless you are by yourself.  My sons and I ordered a vertible sampler: ribs, cheese-steak, and pulled-pork. My son with the ribs said they could teach Applebee's what a half-rack really should be. Bones were soft, making me suspect these were braised first, which isn't a bad thing. But meat fell off the bone, but wasn't loose itself. Smokey flavor through-out the meat. The cheese-steak's meat seemed to be glazed, which was nicer than greasy philly-style. My other son wouldn't let me try his pork. The baked beans on the side of the ribs were awesome, with a sweet, tangy flavor reminiscent of three-bean salad.  Next time we drive thru to my parents, we'll be sure to stop again!",

    "text": "I think this place was formerly known as Brentwood Express.   And yes, it is in the Lost Land Of The Levitske Brothers, a corridor in the South Hills of Pittsburgh full of empty (haunted?) buildings and storefronts where no hipster or yuppie dare venture.   Don't be deterred.    If you like ribs, the black coffins with smoke billowing from them will beckon you easily.   We went there today, getting take-out for dear old Dad on Father's Day. He was cravin' ribs, and no one was disappointed.   Two racks of ribs more than fed the four of us. We got ourselves one rack \"mild\" and one rack \"hot.\" The \"mild\" was good, and the \"hot\" had enough kick to it but not too much that it would burn off your palate. The meat was smoked and had a breakfasty bacon/ham flavor to it. It wasn't falling off the bone, but tender it was.  The sides were excellent. Being a potato salad snob, I appreciated the chunky, perfectly unpeeled potatoes and crunchy green bell peppers. The cole slaw was a tangy, crisp, creamy tub of confetti. The beer battered onion rings were puffy, not at all greasy, and the breading stayed on the onion. The mac and cheese I think had tomatoes or red peppers in it, and bacon! Usually I avoid mac and cheese when I eat out, but I was glad I tried Rowdy's. Rowdy's even has...get this...deep fried pierogi, and being partly of Polish descent, I heartily approved of these cheesy spud packets being dunked in hot fat. Coming complete with melted butter and wilted onions, they made for a fine app.   Rowdy's has burgers, dogs, and other assorted sandwiches in addition to the BBQ delicacies.   Lest I forget to mention the fries. I had a couple since whenever you order deep fried foods in Pittsburgh, you tend to get a few free french fries as they stowaway with whatever else you order. About two or three of them found their way in my fried pierogi and onion rings.    Maybe I'll try the Creeping Death Habanero wings next trip.",

The Buffalo Pulled Chicken was tasty, it would have been out of this world if not for the cold, untoasted roll(-1). Cold sandwich, cold bread, hot sandwich, hot bread. I hate when this basic tenant is broken. It's like putting a meal on a cold plate, boooo. The Mac & Cheese was a spicy one, with some peppers in it for zing, very tasty. Drinks are refillable.

Fries, awesome as alway.  But since four of us ate there three of us began running to bath room for the past 8 hrs.

They brought fresh sweet corn and cooked it AT our venue, which was in Riverside Park (the Chapel Shelter, look it up, it's a great venue).  They also provided us with a huge pile of beef brisket, which was amazingly tender.  Sometimes, it seems like at weddings the food isn't very good because it was cooked in bulk.  Steve from Rowdy gave us samples of the foods before our wedding, and they were flat out amazing.  Then, when he recreated everything in bulk, it was exactly the same which was way impressive. We also had mac n cheese, which was the perfectly sized macaroni and had little pieces of tomato.  We also had potato salad, fresh rolls, seasonal fruit, and...wait for it...vegan sausages (I am vegan)!  He didn't have them on the menu, but had some contact who provided him with super duper gourmet vegan sausages.  He will work anything out for you!  Steve and the Rowdy team is great. I should also add that two guys stayed and helped guide everyone through the serving process and helped with cleanup.  They were really cool guys, and very independent workers.  We were totally carefree at our wedding, not a worry about food!  Also, they are budget-friendly.   I am from California, and this sort of food there would cost an arm and a leg.  You would have to find some hipster restaurant that specialized in gourmet BBQ.  But here you have Rowdy!   Horray! Go to here  :)",

And Rowdy's BBQ had bar none surpassed that! It is your typical order at the window sit outside and eat BBQ style motif. You can also order to go if you choose. They also provide catering as well. The variety of BBQ selections amazed me. It was like bring a kid in a candy store. I had their Mac-n-cheese which was phenomenal. Not overly cheesey but just perfect. Then the fries, oh man. They where nice and crispy from street to finish. By far the best fries I've had in a long time. Just hope I love them. The best I saved for last. I got a half rack of ribs which were by far the best! They had so much texture, smoky flavor, juiciness, mouth watering.

This place is a small stand off of Clairton Blvd, and I never thought much of it until I had my husband stop for dinner one night after I got a craving. The ribs were fantastic--fall off the bone and delicious.  I had the pulled pork, and it's what you expect for slow cooked pork. Add a little BBQ sauce and it's perfect. Ask for extra.  The macaroni is your standard fare, the wheel has not been reinvented, but it's good.  The price and service are great.   We'll continue to explore the menu, but you can't go wrong with their ribs or plain old pulled pork or brisket.  Just ask for extra sauce!",

I still like the beans, was blown away by how great the fries were but I was really disappointed with the chicken and ribs this time.  I was tempted to drop the review to 2 stars.  The ribs were mushy and old tasting.  I would definitely recommend you stick to lunch if you are going to order these.  The white meat part of the chicken was bone dry and overall the chicken is unremarkable.  I would go back and try the pulled pork and get some more of those beans or if I am feeling like a splurge some more of those great fries.",

Their hot pepper cheese balls and Mac and cheese are also amazing.  It is an outside place on the side of route 51 which I suppose is a small downfall but it doesn't keep me from giving it 5 stars. They have a few picnic tables you can sit at but otherwise it's more of a take out type place.  You can also have them cater larger events which I've only experienced once but it was just as good as it is when I get a single sandwich. The food only takes them about 10 min to have ready for you as well or you can always call ahead and order too! I've had their chicken bacon ranch and buffalo chicken sandwiches and both are sooo good. I've also had their regular Philly cheesesteak and their chicken Philly cheesesteak and neither of those have disappointed either. Their pulled pork is equally amazing. The big pig sandwich is one of my absolute go to items on their menu, being that they are obviously a BBQ place as you can see from the name, you know their BBQ sandwiches have to be amazing.   Go here asap! You're welcome in advance. :)",

It doesn't have to be summertime to enjoy Rowdy's food. They have take out year round!  Yum!  Tonight we ordered ribs, chicken, a burger, a chili cheese dog, coleslaw, and fries. Our family likes to share so we laid it out banquet style. I enjoyed a little of everything but enjoyed the chicken the most. Not only are their meats bathed in delicious BBQ sauce, they are also smoked. Not every BBQ place smokes their meats. If you are unfamiliar with the smoking process you need to know that it turns the meat pink on the inside. Some people freak out and think the meat is undercooked.  Their fries are handcut and their coleslaw is perfectly balanced. And don't miss out on their chili!  With the smoked meat it is fabulous!  I wish I could recreate it at home.  The next time you are thinking BBQ-think Rowdy!",

I was actually excited to come down to Rowdy's and try some of their BBQ. I ordered their version of a spicy pulled pork sandwich with some french fries, and I honestly think the best part of my meal might have been the fries. Ouch.  My pulled pork sandwich was un-appealing. I didn't even enjoy eating it, and not to mention I think we waited 15 minutes for our food having been the only people there. What's that all about?  Maybe next time I'll come back to Rowdy's and things will be different, maybe their food will actually have some spice to it, maybe the food won't take enough time for me to drive to Uniontown and back, maybe I'll actually enjoy eating there; we shall see.

Good bbq should have sauce offered on the side. The chicken was dry and pretty bland. The ribs were ok, a little over cooked and not much flavor from the rub. The beans were ok, nothing to get excited about. The house cut fries were awesome, which makes it a shame the rest of the meal was average at best.",

He chose fries as his side with ribs. (sandwiches do not come with sides)   My sandwich was ok. Delicious actually with cheddar cheese sauce on it. It took me 3 different servings to finish it all.   My bf raved about the ribs all night & told everyone about how they fell off the bone.. although he did say that they lacked on sauce. The fresh cut fries were AMAZING. I think i tried the brisket and it was also good.   Anyways this was a nice change for us, My boyfriend loved it. I wish the sandwiches came with fries and they offered a bathroom other than a portajohn (which was %*#$%& disgusting. I ran away as soon as i first opened the door, which sucked bc the skate park also didnt have a restroom.)",

    "text": "As someone who lives just north of Pittsburgh, I am definitely one of those people who grumbles whenever I have to cross a bridge and/or go through a tunnel to get somewhere.  There may be traffic and it may or may not add 30 seconds on to my drive, but the thought of it usually puts me in a grumpy mood and I'll act as if this extra 30 seconds means I have to pack an overnight bag.    Yet when I set out to get take-out from Rowdy BBQ, I was not even thinking about the location.  Until I was sitting in stand still traffic on 51.  With nowhere to go but forward, onward to the Brentwood Express shack for some barbecue I went.  I arrived in one piece, greeted by the Rowdy Rooster, thankful that delicious barbecue would be my reward.    I'm pretty sure I've been here before, but it's been so long ago I don't even remember what I ate.  And I'm pretty sure someone else drove which is why I didn't remember the traffic.  Nevertheless, I went with my usual pulled pork sandwich and mixed it up with the buffalo chicken sandwich.  One for now, one for later.  The pulled pork was good, though I was surprised by the cheddar cheese sauce as opposed to sliced or shredded cheese on top.  The buffalo chicken sandwich, which I got with provolone instead of the cheddar cheese, was better in my opinion than the pulled pork.  And after reading other reviews, I think I may have made a mistake by not getting any sides.  Should I brave 51 again, I will definitely repeat that buffalo chicken sandwich.  Along with some sides and maybe some brisket or one of those amazing looking cheesesteaks.  And next time I'll call ahead so I can spend my time sitting in traffic as opposed to waiting for my order.  Then maybe I can update my review and add another star.",

The pulled chicken and pulled pork are very good with the smoked taste to them. They also served bbq sauce was on the side and the meat was portioned generously for the price. For a little extra, you can get rolls for sandwiches.    The place is set up for pick-up orders mostly. They do have out door seating with a few picnic tables. It is also set up along side of busy 51, so it can be a little stressful to get in and out of the parking lot, but it's a good location to attract business for them.     I do recommend them for catering and parties. They are reasonable, and make an effort to make sure you are satisfied with their service. Thumbs up!",

I've had big sandwiches, but I didn't see any way that it could've been picked up in its entirety and eaten with hands. This was definitely a steal in terms of value, considering that the pulled pork was as good as they advertised. Smoky, flavorful, and tender, all while not overly dry or saucy, making it a great comfort food.",

The ribs are absolutely perfect, meat falls right off of the bone and there is very little gristle. The sandwiches as well are enormous, and so good!

I've tried quite a few things from their menu and I can honestly say I have never been disappointed.   My favorite thing to get is the ribs, which are fall off the bone with a mild smoky flavor. I like to get them with their original BBQ sauce with a side of their hot BBQ sauce. It's nice to have an option for sauces even if it's just two. When you get ribs, it also comes with a side.   Rowdy BBQ is a grab and go place and you usually get your food pretty quickly. Another reason to love Rowdy BBQ is that they're open year round!",

This place has only outside seating which means for a good portion of the year is only takeout.  We were the only people there when we ordered, though there was one other person that ordered after us. So the place wasn't busy and they do primarily takeout business. You would think they could get a simple order correct. But no.  When we got home we had the sandwiches, we had the onion rings (which were beer battered and very good), but no coleslaw. This was not a complicated order and all they do is take out at this time of year, how do you screw up an easy order like that?  I would have called to complain but what's the point. It was too far to go back and get the coleslaw and the rest of the food wasn't good enough that I'm going back anytime soon. If you are in the area and want a quick bite it's not a bad option but it certainly isn't worth making a special trip for this barbecue.",

Rowdy's smoked brisket sandwich was filled with fall apart in the bun tender brisket smothered in a sweet tangy bbq sauce. I always ask for extra BBQ sauce on the side for which I was accommodated. The bun was it's downfall though, their bun is tough and thin which contradicts it's soft yummy filling. Next time I may opt for a brisket plate if they offer one and just use a slice of soft bread to make my own sandwich.  Their mayo based potatoe salad was delicious but flavored with a bit to much onion for my taste buds. The coleslaw tasted exactly the same minus the onion, actually kinds flavorless all together. They offer more sides than I tried so I'll probably opt to get different ones next time.",

I ordered the chicken bacon ranch hoagie with a side of mac and cheese, and both were REALLY good. The bun for the hoagie was so soft - I got my sauce on the side so it wasn't soggy which is very important to me. The sandwich normally comes with ranch, obvs, but I also got a side of their bbq sauce to try. Both sauces were awesome on the sandwich, and if you're feeling froggy mix them together! The mac and cheese had the tiniest spice to it, but it was really good too. My husband got the pulled pork sandwich, and he loved it too!  We ordered multiple takeout orders over the phone and there was a bit of confusion, but I am going to blame that on us. I will def be returning here when I am in the mood for some bbq!",

    "text": "Excellent! I'm ashamed to admit how many times I've passed by this place without ever having stopped to try it!  I got the sampler and the ribs and chicken were both excellent, the fries were amazing. The macaroni and cheese was ok, but not as special as the fries. Good value, friendly window service, I think they're currently the best place to get BBQ in Pittsburgh.",
