It is a relaxed atmosphere and a great place for happy hour with nice drink specials. On my recent visit they had a delicious pumpkin beer. I definitely recommend the pizza as they always have fresh toppings.  Our server wasn't the friendless but he got the job done and with a large group of people coming and going always checked in on us.",

This was my first time being here and my boyfriend's second time. I got a soup and a salad, and he got the Slow Roasted Chicken. All was very good and our waitress was very attentive. We were seated with a few of the outdoor area. However, it must've taken the hostess to alert the waitress that she seated us about 15 minutes to come over to our table. This is the only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars.",

    "text": "The Porch is a bar/restaurant nestled between food huts in Schenley Plaza, and a welcome one at that. It's always nice to have new options in Oakland.   I have been here a few times and sampled the appetizers, pizzas, and several entrees.  I really enjoy the garden harvest salad, which is topped with mushrooms and goat cheese. Very tasty!   When it comes to entrees, I have found that I like trying their daily specials when I can.  In early summer, The Porch had a delicious baked meatball offering.  The red snapper is also very good. My fish was perfectly cooked and served with clams and vegetables in a saffron broth.   For some reason, I find the pizzas to be a bit bland, even their more creative ones. The \"bianca\" has an interesting pairing of fig and goat cheese, but comes off a bit TOO sweet.  The pesto-themed \"genovese\" is the opposite, and is much too salty for my taste.   The dessert menu changes daily. The chocolate bread pudding was delicious, but the tiramisu wasn't as impressive.   There are nice little touches that make The Porch a great place to go. First, I like that they have a self-serve water bar (glass coolers with fresh herbs and citrus). The Porch also has... a porch. I know, you're shocked!   The outdoor patio and bar are the perfect place to have a casual drink and meal in the warmer months. There is also a fireplace in case it gets a bit chilly.   As far as the bar goes, there is a small but well-chosen selection of seasonal beers on tap as well as a decent wine list.  A small warning, however. As The Porch attempts to use local ingredients, the only whiskey they have is from Wigle in the Strip. That's all well and good, but Wigle is a bit of an acquired taste, in my opinion. It will not taste the same in mixed drinks as Jack or Johnny.   Overall, the Porch is an excellent addition to the Oakland restaurant and bar scene. The bartenders are just wonderful and so is the majority of the menu. If they reassess their pizza offerings, I may add the fifth star.",

    "text": "A fast place for grabbing a great casual lunch! The soup was good, as was the veggie burger. It had lots of delicious toppings and the pattie tasted decent - probably wasn't made-from-scratch that morning, but hey, it was leagues better than a typical veggie burger, and we're talking entrees less than $10, not a five star fancy restaurant here. This place definitely is not the \"let's microwave a Boca patty and slap it on a stale bun\" version of veggie burger, thankfully!  Service is reasonably quick for lunch, as you place the order at the counter prior to taking a seat (good luck finding one at peak times), although waiters deliver the food to the table. In the winter it's too cold to sit outside, but the location of this place makes it perfect to sit on the grassy lawn next to it! Definitely not a bad place to go if you're nearby.",

It's not an extensive menu, like the Cheesecake Factory - but you can get good pizza or a duo of rabbit.  (The kid's pizza by the way, was probably some of the best pizza I've had in a while.)  Oh yeah, for those with kids, this place is very kid friendly.  The kids menu is standard, but pretty good.  I actually ate my kid's pizza, which was huge!  There were 4-5 large slices, for only $6.    I'm pretty sure The Porch will be on our short list of places to eat when we want to go out with the rugrats.  It's basically an upscale Eat 'n Park (same owners, so that makes sense I guess.)  Give it a try.",

    "text": "I ate here this past Saturday afternoon for lunch with my girlfriend and her parents.  I had been wanting to try this place for quite some time but joys of driving and parking in Oakland have helped to keep me away.  The outside of this place also does not look like much from Forbes but the inside is utterly charming.  Everything is super sleek and clean and they even have the restaurant trendy opening garage doors which were open whenever we came in.  It also looked like they had an outdoor fireplace which I was a fan of.  For brunch my girlfriend and I decided to split two of the entrees with each other since we were having a hard time deciding on one.  The two that we decided to split were the rocket salad which had chorizo, beets, shallots and sunflower seeds with a sherry vinaigrette and the bianca pizza which came with fig jam, goat cheese, arugula and black truffle oil.  I started off with the salad and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The was a surprisingly amount of good tasting chorizo on the salad with some nice greens that combined perfectly with the soft beets and crunchy sunflower seed to make a perfect salad.  I honestly would have been happy if I had ordered that by myself and I am normally not a salad as a meal kind of guy.  The pizza came plated on what looked like a huge cookie sheet with small piles of red pepper, oregano and Parmesan at the top of the sheet for your use which I appreciated.  It was unlike any pizza that I have had before but not in a bad way.  The fig jam and goat cheese made it more savory that I had anticipated while the arugula helped with some freshness.  Overall I enjoyed but I do not think that I would order it again.  I was also able to taste the farm bread side dish which came with sides of jam, apple butter and honey butter.  All the sides were exceptionally good and added some great flavors to the bread.  I would not hesitate to order it again.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here in the future.  I really enjoyed everything that I had tried and loved that the fare was a bit more eclectic than normal.",

It's a cool place for perhaps meeting friends for a drink but the food is overpriced for the quality--at least for the veggie burger. It was as if the cooks took whatever veggies they had laying around and mixed them into a paste and grilled it. No real consistency in what I was eating. Random flavors, pleasant and not, throughout the burger. I only ate half of it. Very disappointed.",

It's not that it is prepared badly it's just that the recipes are often trying so hard to be different they just don't taste that good.   I say this after two visits.  The first time I got a pizza with prosciutto. The meat was just to strong. The second visit I got a turkey sandwich. Great turkey, great bread, bad combination of condiments.  I may go back but I will just get the simplest thing on the menu, like the bread with butter and jam that is really awesome.",

Since I'm a big bar food lover, the menu here is too uppity for my tastes. They don't have french fries, but these weird potato balls that are seasoned. I ended up getting the margherita pizza both times, which is big enough to share (it had better be for ~$11). The atmosphere is okay, and sitting outside on a nice day is decent. I'm not a beer drinker but my BF wasn't too impressed with their beer offerings.  Overall, a good place to visit during happy hour or later for 1/2 price pizza, but other than that it's too fancy (and expensive) for my tastes as far as food goes.",

Two in our group had the filets ordered/prepared at opposite ends of wellness & we were both impressed!  I really enjoyed the Tiramisu - one of the best I've had!

It is right on Schenley Plaza, which is opens out onto during nice weather. This is great during the summer months. The ambiance inside is very nice. Modern but it is warm with a little personality. We have never had a problem with the staff; they have always been very friendly and helpful with us.  On to the food. I generally get a pizza. They are really really good. It is thin crust, and it approaches a New Haven-style pizza but it is more chewy than crispy. The toppings seem to be high-quality. I like to keep my pizza plain here (just cheese and sauce) although the meat-za is good as well. I've also had the prime rib. It is pretty good, but you need to be careful, as they tend to overcook it based on what you ask for. I asked for it Medium and it had very little pink. You definitely don't want to go more than Medium Rare here.  We often get the side of potatoes which are very nice and flavorful. The hot donuts are also pretty good. I avoid the dipping sauce as I think they are flavorful enough without it.  They have a basic list of beers on tap and in bottle. Somewhat uniquely, they have Duquesne on tap! Certainly not a \"premium\" beer but good on a hot summer day.  Definitely we will keep coming back, particularly in the summer.",

The service was quick, yet thorough, even though we dined close to 9pm. My only complaint would be with dessert. I ordered the creme brulee (also flavorful) but they were all out of fresh fruit, the supplemental figs, so they gave me a ramekin of about 10 small blueberries. It was weird.

We arrived when there was no wait and the restaurant was 3/4 empty inside and mostly full outside but with a few empty tables. We weren't given an option of being seated outside, and with only two people, the host took us through the whole restaurant to the very back and seated us at two big pushed together tables with 8 chairs directly next to a 30ish person wedding reception that was in the main dining room. On this trip, we walked past empty dirty table after dirty table and across a filthy floor. I couldn't figure out why we were being seated at this huge table next to a wedding party that was taking photographs, but assumed it was because the entire rest of the restaurant appeared to be filthy. I was wrong. The table where we were seated was dirty and sticky, as were the menus and the wrapped silverware.  The wedding party had multiple little kids who were running around with drink cups between the tables, which meant they were running past my boyfriend's back between him and the adjacent table. I would have asked to move tables, but the whole place was so dirty that I couldn't even stomach the thought of eating  there.

However the nice thing about The Porch is their menu is constantly changing so even if you eat there often you can always try something different. Great atmosphere, love the layout, the side porch is cozy with the outside fireplace. The Porch is a must try. And I suggest going when it's warm out & dining on their porch.",

I like the decor and the patio, although getting in and out of the restaurant space to, say, use the restroom is pretty awkward because they make everyone go through the front entrance.  But I digress. A friend and I came here for dinner and she got the Caesar salad and skillet cornbread for us to share, and I got a pizza.  She said her salad was great, and it was all I could do not to eat that entire cornbread because it was PERFECTION.  I like mine on the coarse side, plus it was a little sweet and just moist enough to not need any butter. My pizza--an arugula with figs--was fantastic was well.",

    "text": "We recently went for a late lunch with family. Having eaten at the Porch this summer, my wife was glad to go back. This time, however, it did not end well.  Both my wife and I had the Reuben sandwich. When it came to the table, the meat was both brown and red, like someone had warmed it up on the grill. The kraut was a strange color and consistency. While I had a bad feeling about it, we ate it anyhow.  That was a really bad idea, as we both became sick the next day. No doubt it was the sandwich.  The service was very slow.  The idea that you have to go and fill your own water glass is crazy. And they almost didn't serve a late arriving family member because the lunch hour was almost over ( even though all the servers had time to sit at a table have drinks together....really?). Did I say how s..l..o..w the service was.  Seeing that others on Yelp have gotten sick after eating here, I feel confident that the management isn't following proper food handling rules.  Maybe it's time for a visit from Gordon Ramsey.  Corn beef should not be brown and kraut should be crispy.   Next time, I will eat at the \"O\" which might be safer.  The best part of the Porch is the atmosphere and the curried ketchup.",

I got the chicken, biscuits and sausage gravy.  I think they use chicken thighs, rather than white meat chicken.  Thighs taste so much better!!!!

The lighting inside is a bit garish for my taste, but the environment is cool, in both senses of the word, modern, and comfortable.    Come here for the pizza, but stay for the pizza.  If you love thin, crispy, adult pizza this is the spot.  The rest of the menu is serviceable but uninspired.  The harvest salad with mushroom, walnut, and goat cheese could use something more to separate it from typical salad-bar fare--other than the goat cheese.  That said--the pizza.  There's always the pizza.",

It's very clean and modern with a wrap around outside porch to eat in... and lots of Pokestops.  The menu changes seasonally and they have daily food specials.  I ordered the corn fritter wraps. It was homemade corn fritter patties, with lettuce that you hand wrap and a spicy sauce that had a meaty taste with a kick. The flavors were not what I  expected but it was interesting.  It tasted like spicy sausage.  I also tried their spring chicken pizza which was descent, had good dough and you can add your own spices. I would have liked more chicken and toppings. It also tasted meaty and earthy, would have liked more garlicky flavor.  This was a good place to eat, I'd like to stop back again. I would like to see stronger flavors.",

The way that it is set up, you walk in and order your meal first, take a number, and then sit where you like (for lunch anyway). You also grab your own water- they have pitchers available with water or \"fancy\" water that is enhanced with fresh fruit and herbs. I prefer the fruit enhanced water- delish.   I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, my mom ordered the Reuben and we also ordered lemon basil house soda and passion fruit gelato.   Yes... They make their own sodas- they feature different creations depending on when they run out, and also by season. The lemon basil house soda sounded odd to me but my mom wanted to try it. Oh my goodness I am so thankful we did- it was AMAZING! The highlight of everything. I couldn't believe how much I loved it. It was packed with flavor and the two flavors complimented each other so well. Mhm!   The pizza was amazing too, fresh jalapenos, BBQ sauce, chicken, pineapple.. Baked in a brick oven and topped with fresh cilantro. Amazing. My mom loved her Reuben too, but the house salad was a little disappointing- it was just fresh greens and a house dressing , no other veggies.   When ordering the food we asked if we could have the gelato after we finished our meals. After finishing them, we asked an employee if we could have the dessert that we ordered. It took about 12 minutes for the dessert to get to our table.  Not too long of a wait, but dessert that is always prepared should not take that long. The passion fruit gelato was incredible. Packed with flavor . They give you three scoops!  My mom and I left with full and happy tummies! Looking forward to going back- and hoping they have lemon basil house soda when I do!",

Some of my favorites are the Garden Harvest salad, Bianca Pizza, Crispy Taters, and the pulled pork sandwich. They have a good happy hour menu ($5 wines!) and daily dinner specials. I also love that they grow some of their herbs on site and use a sustainable menu!  The waitstaff / bartenders have always been very friendly and helpful and many of them have been there for a while so they have great suggestions.   I've taken larger groups there as well, with a reservation, and they did a great job with our catering order and made the 20+ person event a great time for everyone!

Our waitress was very nice and our food came out very quickly.  I ordered the creamy tomato soup which was amazing. I also had the biscuits and gravy side dish and it wasn't for me... it had a heave fennel or star anise flavor that I greatly dislike. The biscuits and gravy were also lukewarm which was displeasing. My brunch company got the feta and onion omelet and the smoked salmon with bagel chips. Both were pretty good, but the portion of the salmon was very small for how much it cost- but about a beautiful plate!  The interior is super hip and trendy and I would say the food is also. It's in a convenient location, near Shenley Park and the Cathedral of Learning but plan ahead for parking... it can be limited due to the urban location",

The wait for seating has not been an issue, but choose your times well, for example early evening weekend dinners might be a little crowded.  The noise level can be a bit high at times, but what can you do.  Now, onto the most important part of the review; the FOOD!

You order at the register, but you still have a variety of seating indoors and outdoors in a pleasantly decorated environment. It's a relatively big restaurant. It's also a nice place to duck away from the rain and have a cold beer at the bar. There are some bar nibbles too and the roasted shishito peppers were sweet and delicious. It came with large blocks of ricotta and mint pesto. I also had a burger here, which was a bit more undercooked than I expected. Still good though. It came with some yummy pickled veggies on the side. Most dishes also come with either a side salad or side of roasted potatoes, both of which are good. There's also a good selection of wood-fired pizzas. I appreciate the flavored waters, but don't skip out on the seasonal sodas -- I recommend it. For brunch, I liked the biscuits with sausage gravy and citrus rhubarb french toast.",

But it is a bit pricy. 1 appetizer, 3 drinks, and 3 entrees cost almost $120 after tip. This is definitely a $$$ restaurant.",

I ordered a salmon salad in which was very fresh and unique with its melted leeks and orange shavings. Though I wanted more salmon I thought it was not skimpy on the salmon. My wife ordered a ribeye steak sandwich and taters. The sandwich was salad, but what a nice change to have whole potatoes instead of normal fries. They were done simply but perfectly. It was at least 6 small potatoes on the plate which was more then generous. They gave my son free apple juice and they had complimentary water flavored with strawberries and or lemons and mint. Nice touch instead of the standard tap water. I say check this place out I was pleasantly surprised.",

Each time I rationalized my previous bad experience, but it never got better. EVERY SINGLE TIME I eat here, I wind up a varying degree of food poisoning. Which is really disappointing because the location is great, and the opportunity to dine outside is relatively rare.  But the location alone isn't enough to outweigh the toxic food, the unfriendly service, the limited selections for happy hour, and the overall sense of impending dread that comes with dining here. Pass on this place unless you're just going to have a cocktail on the patio.",

    "text": "Been here a number of times for lunch.   The biggest plus of this place is the ambiance and spaciousness, which is in stark contrast with most of the restaurants in Oakland that are crowded, noisy, and feel a little claustrophobic.   While the ambience is great, the food could be better and is OVERPRICED.  AMBIENCE The ambience here is outstanding.  It is spacious.  The ceilings are high, and there is lots of natural lighting from the large windows.  The architecture on the building is great.  I like the lanterns above the main entrance and large fireplace as you enter.  There is also a lot of outside seating, which I presume would be great when the weather is warmer outside.  It is right next to Schenley Park, with lots of green space around.  I've been here a number of times with colleagues and it is a great place to talk.    FOOD For lunch, you order at the front and grab a number.  There are salads, sandwiches, and pizzas.  I've had both the sandwiches: $9 or $10 and the pizzas: $11-$14.   While the crispy taters that come with the sandwiches are very good, crisp and fresh, the sandwiches left more to be desired.  If you don't mind the extra few $, go for the pizza.  They have a wood oven, which they use to bake the pizzas.  I've had the Bianca pizza $13: the the fig name was very sweet and went well with the goat cheese and mozzarella mixed with arugula.",

They served a buffet of lamb legs, stuffed shells, salmon (whatever they did to it was amazing), mashed potatoes (OMG soooo good), asparagus, and mixed vegetables.  The signature cocktail of the night was a pink lemonade and it was made with The Porch's homemade limoncello! Mmmmmmm I had to sample it quite a few times :)  The event space was a great size for  I'd estimate 125-150 guests inside (although I am the worst estimator in the world so that could be off). The space was able to be set up to have a nice sized dance floor, a photo booth, and dj all in the from entrance. They set up a 2nd bar in the back.  The event staff was amazing, especially the bartenders. Everyone was very friendly and actually seemed to be having a nice time too.  I don't know what the pricing or availability situations are, but I thought The Porch made for a great special event setting.",

Great Location right between the libraries and with the view of the learning of cathedral and the infamous  Dippy! Parking shouldn't be hard to find with all the kiosk parking space all over oakland.  2. Great atmosphere - Although we opted to stay outside since it was a beautiful day - the inside section looked equally comfortable, modern and enjoyable. But if you happen to visit for the first time - I would recommend you stay outside assuming the weather is still warm.  3. Great Service! Again! like all other places this will most likely depend on the server but ours was amaing.  4. Finally Great Food! We started off with the fresh farm bread that came with Housemade Jam, Apple Butter, & Honey Butter and the Pan seared Scallops which was done to perfection. My lady got the Roasted Lamb Shake which was amazingly good (of course I had to try) and being a fan of seafood - I went with the salmon which was really good but I could definitely go for another round of the Roasted Lamb.  Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I treated a party of 8 to Porch. None of them knew what a Yelp Elite was. After I schooled them on the concept, they asked me how I would review The Porch. So this is what I told them...  The process.. If you enter for lunch, grab a menu and head straight for the counter. If you go for dinner, you can order from your table. Inside or out? You pick! The bar area in the middle is often open on a nice day for an delightful breeze.  The atmosphere... Come as you are. It's at the park, but it's grown-up food in downtown Oakland. Some people have just come in from sunbathing or exercising; others are meeting friends after work or on a date. It can get very loud so definitely it's not a great place to have an intimate conversation or an important meeting. We find it perfect for our family because it's loud enough that we don't have to keep telling our 4-year-old to be quiet (she is expected to sit in her chair--it's not completely a family restaurant), but we can eat good food in an adult restaurant. Also, it's walking distance for all of our friends who work at the universities.  First of all, everything at Porch is made in house--including their own Lemoncello--and we love that!  I explained that one way to experience a great meal at Porch is to split a pizza (they're big!) and a salad with a pal. Many took my advice.  First course: one person had the soup of the day. Vegetable beef. Unremarkable. Salads. Everyone was pleased with the fresh vegetables and quality ingredients. The Summer Bean & Shrimp was a stand-out and is considerably heartier than the others.  If you like cornbread, they make a delicious version called Farmbread in an individual-sized cast iron skillet. It's a bit sweet which was a slight disappointment to those who believe cornbread should be savory. However, everyone thought it was an excellent addition to the meal and loved the sweetened butter that accompanied it.   My personal favorite item here is the crispy taters. \"Tuscan-style\" (whatever that is?) fried baby white potatoes with a thai ketchup. Love them. Can eat the entire very generous portion myself but shared. Everyone loved them and their special ketchup--except my 4-year old who demands plain ketchup, but she's 4, and ketchup is one of her top 10 favorite foods.  The pizzas here my favorite in the city...well, perhaps tied with Mercurios... Before I knew that gluten was responsible for my rashes, migraines, and tiredness, I would feast on these delicious creations for lunches and dinners. My fellow diners enjoyed the BBQ chicken (with the Jalapenos on the side) and zucco arrositito (\"veggie white\"). The crust is thin, but not too thing and crispy and the mozzarella is shaved fresh. My daughter loves the kid's cheese pizza, and it's large enough for two children to share.  As the gluten-free rep, I currently order the half-chicken. It was cooked to perfection and served over peppers and fingerling potatoes. Delicious. I don't eat red meat so instead of the chorizo sauce, I've had them substitute with the red wine and the pesto--both are great. (On a separate trip, my husband raved about the prime rib.)  For dessert, we split the s'mores, chocolate-peanut better cheesecake, and homeade cinnamon donuts with fruit compote. I cannot say enough about all three of them. They were literally devoured by our party. We couldn't even select a favorite! Get them all!  The service is nearly always good with helpful staff. There can be a long wait for things at times, and I'm sometimes a bit annoyed when food is not well-timed, e.g., one of the pizzas was delivered a good 10 minutes after the rest of the food. If there is a problem or a special request, I've found the management to excellent. One manager zoomed our food through the kitchen so that we could get to the library for a children's program on time.  Other goodies:  They have a super cool \"walk-up window\". It opens at 7am for breakfast sandwiches, pastries, and coffee. The restaurant itself doesn't open until 11am. In the summer they also serve boxed picnic lunches.  They take Plaid Cash and Panther Funds and Credit Cards.  They have a wide selection of beer, wine, and delish cocktails, but they will also do BYOB for $15.  By the by:  In case you recognized the letters on the door, they're actually owned by the Eat and Park group as are Six Penn Kitchen and Hello Bisto. Don't let this fact stop you. Other than the fact that all these restaurants are committed to sustainability, locally sourced produce, and customer service, they're nothing alike.",

I was a bit disappointed that it didn't come with anything on the side, like crackers or a piece of good bread, but still happy with the choice overall.   We went at a busy time (used the Yelp app to get in line before arriving, so we didn't wait), and it was a loud environment. It's pretty open with high ceilings, so be prepared for a noisy experience if you go at a popular time.   Overall we liked it!",

This is one of the only places in the area where you can find upper scale food and fresh ingredients without venturing into a different Pittsburgh neighborhood. The pizza is delicious which can be hard to come by in Pittsburgh; I recommend the Bianca. However, I do believe the salads here are a bit overpriced and small. The servers have always been great every time I've visited even when extremely busy. Also, an overlooked piece of this place is the one dollar coffee and cheap breakfast sandwiches sold in a window on weekdays mornings. This can be a great pick-me-up for students on the go. The sit down brunch is also very good. For college kids, this spot is a great treat when you're willing to spend a few extra bucks. For most, The Porch offers a pretty good value.",

On the positive side of things they take online reservations (I used the Nowait app) and the restaurant has a nice casual decor (except for the awkward tables pushed together to seat 8 they make you share with strangers if you have less than 8 in your group). Our waitress was also easy to deal with when we experienced an issue.   Negatives start with it took an extremely long time from ordering until our food was done. They also don't allow substitutions, I was not allowed to have regular fries instead of the sweet potatoes fries my steak came with that I did not want. And the kitchen messed up my boyfriends order repeatedly which caused the rest of our group to be finished eating before he even got his food.   Food wise I was not impressed by my steak and my dining companions did not state anything out of the ordinary about their food. Considering the prices, I expected a higher quality meal. I think a steak at Chilis is cheaper and similar quality. Someone I was with ordered a prime rib sandwich and it was more of a lunch portion in size at a dinner price.   Overall my experience was a let down, I'd heard better things and seen better reviews.",

We went at 9 PM on a Thursday for their \"happy hour\" which includes half off of their personal Neapolitan style pizzas. We ordered a Margherita and a  Bianca pizza. The Margherita is your typical cheese pizza but it was very good (especially for $5!). The Bianca had fig, goat cheese, arugula, and truffle oil. It was very good. The fig was sweet and the cheese and truffle oil were a nice complement. I must say they went a little heavy on the arugula for my taste but it was easy to pick a little off. The crust on both the pizzas was airy and delicious. The service was also good. We arrived about 15 minutes before 9 and split an appetizer and the waitress even took down our pizza orders to put in for us at 9. We literally got our pizzas at 9:01. Which turned out to be great because just a few minutes after 9 the place got packed because of happy hour.",

Stumbled upon The Porch with 400+ reviews, a waitlist, and 4 minutes away from where we were. I added my name to the Yelp waitlist and it told me the wait was approximately 15 minutes. We took our time and walked around the beautiful area, and by the time we arrived to the restaurant, we were just in time to make it to the waiting time. Make sure that even if you are nearby, put yourself on the waitlist - overheard a group of 4 who asked for the wait time inside the restaurant and the front desk said it would be approximately 45 minutes.  Service was lovely and our order was taken in no time. The place is bright, spacious, and had a decent ground floor view to the grassfield. But the food itself on the otherhand was just medicore. I ordered the chicken waffles and it was bland and dry; I was not expecting this kind of food that such a beautiful restaurant would make.  All in all, beautiful decor, lovely environment, and nice servers. But food was definetly below average.",

Let me say, the best thing about this really is the atmosphere. It overlooks the Pitt campus, some grass, and has some great tables and an outdoor fireplace.   The pizza, recommended by others, was delicious. I love arugula, and the crust was crisp, yet pillowy. I don't really say bad things about potatoes unless they suck (these were good), but the soda tasted really watered down.   I tried to order an espresso at the end of my meal - I went back to the counter and asked for a double. The chick at the counter (who was new, granted), said that she would have to charge me double for one, since it was two shots. That would've been north of $4 for it. What? The guy next to here finally had to say, \"that's not how we do it,\" and helped me rectify the situation.",

Four stars for the environment - great porch (hah) out back that shields the sunlight/rain but exposes weather to dine in. Nice little bar outside in addition to the one indoors - super chill place to hang out and have a drink or three or four in the afterno--err evening. I found the indoors a bit hectic with a slight odor of kitchen grease, but while the outside is preferable, the overall decor is warm and bright, and so are the employees.   Two stars for my lunch ... My burger was flavorless and not cooked medium like I asked, with nothing much to help its lack of flavor and slightly rubbery texture. Luckily I was pretty full from the taters and didn't care to much.   Prices are reasonable, and everything on the menu sound like great flavor combinations in my head, so hopefully execution is better on other dishes...   I think I'd come back to give the food another chance (the pizzas looked delicious and i'm not even a pizza person), or at the very least just to munch on some taters and catch up with friends and enjoy the weather - it's a killer location, what with being smack dab in the middle of pitt campus and all.",

    "text": "Oh, Porch, I have such a love-hate relationship with you.  Yes, I still think you're one of the better, more upscale restaurants in Oakland--however, given the low standards of the Oakland dining scene, that isn't saying a whole lot.  And yes, I love your happy hour--although I don't love the fact that I have to sit at the bar or outside to enjoy it, and that no concessions are made for rainy weather.  Unfortunately, however, your service and execution frequently fail to impress me.  Yesterday afternoon, I came over for happy hour with a large group, and we had to squeeze around two tables, since no other large tables could be requisitioned.  I should know by now that this is par for the course, however, since I come once a month for a different happy hour, and we always have to squeeze around several small round tables in the bar area.  Aside from that, however, the service was severely lacking.  Our group sat there for 10 min. before a waiter approached us, and then, after asking for a draft list, he disappeared for another 10-15 min. to wait on the other tables, despite that we tried to attract his attention several times.  Finally, he came back over, and we ordered a few pitchers of beer.  Since I don't drink beer, I inquired about the Wigle spiced cider, and was informed that it wasn't being stocked right now because it was seasonal.  I then inquired about the house made sodas, which I've enjoyed in the past, only to be told they they didn't have them, either.  At that point, I just wanted something to drink that they actually had in stock, so I ordered a simple glass of lemonade, which my neighbor had ordered.  While I understand that some drinks are seasonal, I think the menu should be updated to reflect this, similar to the food menu, to avoid people becoming flustered due to not being able to order drinks they want (like me!).  In addition to our drinks, our group ordered the bianca and margherita pizzas.  The bianca, as always, was great--this is still one of my favorite gourmet pizzas in PGH, and my go-to pizza at the Porch.  The margherita pizza, however, was greasier than versions I've had from the Porch at the past, which was disappointing.  CM came over to meet me towards the end of happy hour, and we decided to stay and order dinner, since I had a City Dining Card, and it'd been awhile since I'd had a full meal at the Porch.  Fortunately, our waiter, who was different than the waiter of our happy hour group, was more attentive.  For our entrees, CM ordered the prime rib sandwich ($14), his favorite entree at the Porch, and I ordered the rotisserie chicken ($19), one of the few food items on the menu that I hadn't tried previously.  The chicken was plated attractively in a manner reminiscent of a fine dining establishment.  Despite being white meat, it was moist and tender, and the flavors of the accompaniments complemented the chicken well.  However, while it was enjoyable, I'm not convinced that it was worth the cost.  CM enjoyed his rib sandwich--but again, it seemed like a questionable value, given that most sandwiches in the area cost approximately half of what this one did.  Thankfully, the City Dining Card knocked $10 off of our check.  While I have no doubt that I'll continue to patronize the Porch for happy hour (mostly because my dept. pays for it...), I stand by my former assertion that the food is hit-or-miss and kind of overpriced, and the service can be rather lackluster.  I suppose you're paying for location, though, given its convenience and proximity to Schenley Plaza.  I'd recommend sticking to the pizzas (esp. the bianca!) and the cocktails, esp. if you're not a beer drinker, like me.  Additionally, I'd advise visiting during happy hour or late night for half priced pizzas to cut down on the cost--that is, unless your employer's paying, in which case it doesn't matter!  3.5 stars.",

We had Mushroom Pizza, Garden Harvest salad, 3 cocktails, 1 beer flight and 1 dessert (biscotti). Everything was tasty, but the pizza dough and drinks were just outstanding. And speaking about the service it was one of the nicest ever. We had Megan as our waitress and I have to say that a big part of our wonderful experience was easy and enjoyable communication with her. Thanks Megan for making our day even brighter then it already was : )! We are glad to discover a new tasty destination for us and definitely coming back when in the area.",

Other times it feels like I'm being ignored and bothering the staff with my presence.   I've been during the seat yourself lunch hours, which I don't particularly like the set up of because it's hard to flag someone down if you need something. During the warmer months it is perfect for a larger group gathering, but there also seems to be a lot of disorganization and servers running around trying to find where the next order should be dropped off.   I've been in for dinner with a large group and the waitstaff were accommodated amazingly. I'm very surprised by how well they handle large groups given. I've been here a few times with a friend and have had less than stellar service. It seems to be very hit or miss with the quality of service that is provided.   One thing that left a sour taste in my mouth was this past summer my friend and I were looking for a late night dinner option. The restaurant website said the place closed at 10, but when we showed at 8:45 we were given the stinkeye by the host and a few servers. It wasn't until we were sat and served drinks that we were informed the kitchen would be closing soon because the restaurant closed at 9pm. There as nary a sign on the door or a mention from the host about the change in hours, and the entire feel of the service felt rushed and shitty. I was told they would tell management that they needed to change to hours on the website, but I never followed through to see if it had been done.",

    "text": "I don't usually write reviews, but I had just a very unpleasant experience with the service at the Porch. Don't get me wrong, the food there is good, but the service leaves much to be desired.   I came alone for lunch, and asked sit to outside. I was seated at the outdoor bar, despite the fact that the entire outdoor patio was empty. Well, alright, I understand, we gotta keep 10 empty tables for groups of 4 that might or might not come within the next half an hour.  But I am very short, and eating with a fork and knife while sitting at a high bar was extremely uncomfortable. After trying that for a few minutes, I asked to be seated at a table, and was told that I can sit at one of the high tables. Which have the same height as the bar. After I pointed that out, the bartender tried to convince me that those tables are \"much shorter\" even though one of the tables is right next to a bar and I could literally compare the two.  (And no, the regular tables weren't reserved: two women came shortly after me, and after seating at a bar for a few while asked whether they can sit at a table, and were given a \"yeah sure!\")   I didn't pursue the matter further, decided to just quietly finish my food and leave. But then the bartender asked me \"Are you done with this? I have a box for you\" while I was still literally chewing my food and had 2 pieces of pizza left on my plate. I found that extremely rude, paid the check, took my food and went to finish it at one of the many outdoor tables around the restaurant.",

Arrived at Schenley Plaza and got seating immediately - a nice sized four person table that was outside but not in the hot sun. We were given cool glasses of water (no ice) before ordering our meal. Josh - our server - was very friendly and super helpful, assisting us with drink choices and meal suggestions. We ordered a mint lime drink (sort of like a mojito) and a local root beer, both of which were great. We ordered a burger with a veggie patty (we are vegetarian) and a cinnamon roll for our main meal. The interplay between sweet and savory was unbelievable - the burger had a great crunch to it and the house made ketchup was also incredible. The cinnamon rolls were also out of this world - definitely eat them sooner rather than later though, as they get a bit cold after finishing the burger (you get three rolls). They were drenched in cream cheese frosting which was very gourmet. These, combined with the potato fries that are included with the entrees, made for a hearty meal for 2.  Pricing was also reasonable, and service was again great. Can't think of anything that needs to be improved. What a wonderful brunch/drinks/dinner location, without all the pretense of a snooty American restaurant! Would absolutely come back again.",

The mediocre food can be forgiven (although overprice) but the service is downright awful. Our server was from the start she had the biggest attitude. We were sat by a drafty window and when we asked to move to another table we felt she was very rude about it. For whatever reason  it couldn't be clearer that our server had preconceived notions that we were going to be a \"difficult\" table and treated us with passive aggressive disrespect. We were so uncomfortable and made to feel that we were not welcome in the establishment. Finally when I asked to have our checks split after she failed to offer us that simple courtesy before bringing the check to the table, I felt she aggressively snatched it from my hand. I asked to see a manager at that point who did not offer us anything but excuses about why the server was good. Just terrible service from the waitress to the manager.  Back to the food. Not worth the money. I had the porch omelette and it was bland and cold. I just want to give people a heads up because there are better places to eat out there.",

The food here is just too good to be missing out on some of those items just because it happens to be 5pm rather than 1pm. I know, I know, a lot of restaurants do this. But it drives me nuts!  Today I had the chopped salad. It is made with romaine lettuce, roasted chicken, chickpeas, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, goat cheese, and tossed in a light honey mustard dressing. The ingredients are so fresh, so light, so perfect...I can't even explain just how good this salad this.  All of the salads at the Porch that I have ever had have been so incredibly excellent. They are perfect. I don't even ever know which one to get because I want all of them in my mouth. How can they be so good, you ask? Crack. They sprinkle crack on them.

I have lived in Pittsburgh for what seems like 8,000 years and who knew a restaurant inside the city had a sustainable garden on the roof????  Talking about eating local???  I recently ate The Porch and I found the smoked wings to be amazing!  They had a slightly porky flavor (how did they achieve that feat?) and were crispy outside, without being cooked.  The roast potatoes with curry ketchup...yummy!  The artisanal meat and cheese tray was simply lovely, along with the roasted vegtables.  Friends of mine ordered the skillet cornbread and were threatening to kill anyone who got in the way of them taking bites.  All in all, a wonderful meal in slightly urbane yet comfortable surroundings.  Who could ask for more?  Not I!  As a matter of fact, the blend of indoor/outdoor dining spaces has inspired me to rethink the design of my own backyard.  Yay me!",

My boyfriend enjoyed his eggs benedict and would recommend it. For the chicken & biscuits, it was good but nothing spectacular. I would probably order something else next time. I thought that the gravy sauce wasn't that good and lacked flavor.   The cinnamon roll was good and warm. The sides were kind of crispy which gave it a nice touch. Would recommend if you still have the stomach room.   Only con is that the waitress started clearing everything on our table which made it weird when i had no utensils to put the remainder of my cinnamon roll into my takeout box.   Overall, I would come back again for brunch.",

I've only ever been to The Porch one other time and it was for dinner.  For lunch, you order at the front and then they serve it to you at your table. I ordered a salad and iced tea. The salad was nothing to write home about, but the iced tea was good. The overall vibe made me feel like I had to get out of there quick!  For my previous dinner with friends we had ordered a flatbread pizza to share with a cheese plate. The meal was good but I remember thinking that I didn't love it. The restaurant was overcrowded and made it hard to chat during our meal.  If you are looking for a quick bite in Oakland it's a decent spot to stop into, but you can feel the college vibe being in that area for sure. Just be ready for what you're walking into!",

    "text": "I have never posted a review about any restaurant whether it was great or horrible. But my family and I had of the worst experience at The Porch this past Thursday (12/27/18). We first visited the Carnegie Museum next door then decided to try out The Porch for dinner. It was my wife, myself, my 7 year old daughter and 4 year old niece. We arrived and there was a short wait. We were seated about 7:20pm. The waitress seemed very uninterested in waiting on us for whatever reason. She got our drink order and within 5 minutes we gave her our food order. It was the basics. I had a salad and wings, kids had a burger, grill cheese and my wife had soup and sandwich. The restaurant was busy but there was no longer a wait and this was at approximately 7:35. We waited and waited and waited for our food. Now it is 8:10pm with no food and waitress came over just one time. I got up and went to the front/bar area and spoke to some older male that I believed was a waiter. I told him that my table was going on over 40mins wait time for our food. He fluffed me off and said I'm a bartender you have to talk to someone else by the kitchen. So I stood by the kitchen door waiting to talk to someone. My server then came up to me and asked what I needed???? I said our food! It's been over 40mins and my kids are hungry I told her. She said it is kind a busy and my food should be up. She then walked away. Our food arrived about 7mins later. My wings were gummy and I ate 2 of my whole order. Everyone else's meals were ok. The manager came over and checked on us and we expressed a concern about the kids \"tots\" and he then brought them out French fries to replace.  Overall the service was terrible and food was nothing exciting. Maybe it was too busy for them but why is that our fault if they are under staffed on Christmas/NYE week?!  I grew up with my family owning several restaurants so I understand its difficulties and off days but I have never been so angry and disappointed at the same time. We will NEVER return. I'm sure no one at the Porch really cares about one review but they lost our business.",

However, the wait was worth it. I ordered the mushroom pizza.   The amount of cheese, olives and mushrooms along with the crust thickness goes well with my preferences. The price is reasonable for the quality of food they offer. One of my colleagues who ordered the sausage and potato pie was happy with the order.   Last time I was here, I had a chance to eat the crispy taters and they are the best at the porch. I would recommend to try these if you get a chance to eat at the porch.

A perfect day to dine outside. The Porch has outside dining and it's in a prime spot for people watching. They serve brunch until 3:00 on weekends, so I was able to take advantage of the brunch menu and the sunshine.  I ordered the Bianca pizza ($13) which is usually my go-to. It's made with Savory Fig Jam, Goat Cheese, Arugula & Black Truffle Oil. I know it says \"savory\" on the menu but this pizza definitely leans toward sweet. It's like a fig newton in pizza form. I tried some of my husband's eggs Benedict ($14) and although it was perfectly fine, it didn't leave a lasting impression. Honestly, I think the food is just a tad bit overpriced.   Service was very disorganized this time around. Our food got delivered to another table and, food runners kept bringing over plates filled with food we didn't order. I'm chalking it up to the unexpected nice day. I have a feeling that everyone was unprepared to serve the outside seating area.   The atmosphere is nice, there's no denying that. Plus, the staff was quite pleasant even through all the confusion, so props to that!",

The prosciutto, egg, parmesan, and jam sandwich is fab. When I went, they were out of bacon so I have not been able to try their classic bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich.   Their brunch on the weekends is also delicious. The eggs benedict is perfect and it comes with their crispy potatoes and spicy ketchup. If you come for brunch, you MUST try their cinamon buns. They are warm and gooey and fresh out of the oven.   Finally, for dinner I typically get their pizza as they are the most reasonably priced item on the menu and huge. I love the Bianca pizza it's the perfect combination of sweet and savory with the sweet fig jam and arugula. I have also had the bacon and eggs pizza which was pretty good. Their pizzas do change seasonally. In the summer I had the chicken artichoke pizza. Their pizzas are always a good choice as they are fresh.   Overall, the porch is one of my favorite dining options in Oakland. A great place to take people visiting or people new to the area.",

    "text": "Two things: 1) cornbread & 2) half off pizza for late night.   The Porch is my go-to casual, yet upscale restaurant in Pittsburgh. Going to school in Oakland, I frequent the Porch because of its proximity and I love both of their regular and brunch menus.   Some of their main entrees can be a bit pricey, but that's why I come here for late night (after 9pm) when they serve their yummy pizzas for half off! My only complaint is that their pizza menu is seasonal (with several permanent ones). My favorite Porch pizza is the Butternut Squash topped with chicken. I was sad when it disappeared from the menu.   I sometimes come to the Porch just for its cornbread. Served in a cast-iron, the cornbread is incredibly tasty, and it's only $5! I highly recommend it if you're here with a large group for late night and you're not feeling pizza but feel like you should munch on something.   This one time I came here for cornbread during late night and while my sever was bringing it to my table, he dropped it. I ended up having to wait longer, but he gave a fresh one free of charge. Now that is good service.   The Porch is also great for brunch. I recommend the quiche or their seasonal waffles.   Overall, I love the Porch. It has a nice variety of food, great service, and a fancier interior decor that brings a nice atmosphere. I can't wait for their butternut squash pizza to come back.   --  taste / 4 aesthetics / 4 atmosphere / 4 service / 4 price for quality /  OVERALL / 3.8",

    "text": "The Porch is popular for being able to accommodate large groups and having decent food, well, we'll see about the latter soon.  The restaurant is located in the hot spot of the Pitt campus, right next to the lawn in front of the Cathedral, which makes it a very scenic location and visible. The inside of the restaurant isn't the neatest, but that's because they usually have to move tables around for larger parties of guests. Still, it's a lively environment that pairs well with the large glass side that lets you gaze into the large green lawn.  Onto the food! So options are porch are definitely plentiful, and drinks are complete as well. But in terms of the quality of the food, I just didn't find anything tasty. Even for things that you can't mess up like a cheese platter or a smoked meat platter, the food was just really dry and weirdly flavored. And for the entrees, I was thoroughly disappointed by how poor everything was made. For one of their ribeye steaks, it was so loose that I had no idea if it was ground beef or steak. For another one of their steaks, that wasn't ground beef, it was so dry that I was essentially chewing on rubber the entire time. Their side dishes are usually the standard, except when they try to be extra, and ugh, it's really an embarrassment. They just out so much crap that you don't want to eat and really make you question what they put in their food.   If there is any bright spot about porch, it's their dessert. But if you're serving desserts from other places like Millie's ice cream, that's not even credit well deserved to the porch.   Sorry Porch, but that was absolutely embarrassing.",

Two of my kids ordered pizzas that were amazing...my salad was loaded with fresh winter ingredients and their French onion soup was a refreshing rich version. My husband and son got steaks...everyone's plate was clean. We stumbled upon Porch on our way to Phipps and are so glad we did!",

    "text": "Dateline 1995: I am a student with no girlfriend at the University of Pittsburgh. All that stands across from Hillman Library is a hot dog cart, a Chinese food truck, and a shaved ice vendor.   Dateline 2012: I'm a warehouse laborer with a girlfriend who works for a mortgage lender. She picks me up on Friday evening, and without a plan in mind, I direct her towards The Porch. I am shocked at how built-up Schenley Drive now is. I am particularly mesmerized at this strange, new, Modernist/Art Deco restaurant we are about to enter, even more so over the fact that it is owned by Eat 'n Park, that ubiquitous local chain eatery staple we either adore or despise.  The Porch's bill of fare is somewhat small, but each item is intriguing enough to make deciding on what to order difficult.  Kay wanted the Farm Bread as an appetizer. I volleyed between Pork Belly and Shrimp & Grits before landing on the latter. Kay still wanted the inexpensive Farm Bread, so we ordered both and did not regret doing so.   The grits were closer to a buttery polenta, a golden pool of richness that the sublimely sauteed shrimp floated atop of. Kale finished off the plate, and I finished it all off in minutes, rationing chunks of the meaty shrimp, dragging them through the polenta and from there, mouth-ward, savoring the creamy, the juicy, the oceanborne, the elegantly Southern.   Onto something straight from the early morning hours: Farm Bread. According to our bubbly, youthful student server whose name I cannot recall, everything is housemade, including the large sheets of white bread, and the honey butter, apple butter, and jam that come with it in small, metallic ramekins. The bread had a chewy, flour-dusted hide as well as plush innards that seemed to nearly evaporate. This is not bread one wolfs down with eggs, however. Instead, you break off pieces from the massive cuts, slather them with each of the three amazing condiments: one sweet, one sweet and lardy, and one tart enough to enliven the dead before slowly partaking.   Successfully resisting the allure of the fiery oven which promised choice pizza, or the fact that their burgers are freshly ground on the premises, I went with the Duck Legs. Oily, briny, skin crisping, meat melting, they sat on a bed of two potato galettes, each imbibed with the essence of the humbly mystical parsnip, flanked by a gaggle of flowery chanterelles, and lying in a potent puddle of Sherry reduction.   As I ate...slowly, relishing what was before me, I had to keep telling myself  that the same company responsible for the Superburger was also behind one of the most ornately gourmet entrees I have ever had.   And if that didn't suffice, clots of foie gras, something I'd never had before until Friday night, were strewn across the entirety of the dish.Their angelic, salty, smooth decadence left me wanting so much more. This wasn't just a dinner; this was a gift to those who love food.   Kay's Chicken Roti defeated her. The rotiserrie chicken came with a cube of Hazlenut dressing, fennel sausage, apple chunks, and a demi-glace of roasted shallots. The dressing, called a \"bread pudding,\" was ethereal. The chicken breast I finished for Kay was unbelievably moist and supple. Traditionalists, take heed. This is your dish at Porch.   Our duo of desserts were exemplary but hard to finish. My brick-sized Chocolate Bread Pudding had only a hint of chocolate, the better to focus on the heavenly heft of the sweet stuffing itself. A compelling case for the reuse of stale bread had been made and was topped with a colossal scoop of SCRATCH whipped cream that almost had the consistency of gelato. Raisins garnished the plate beautifully and palatably.   Kay's Chocolate Apricot torte was also covered in the whipped cream. I had a taste and found its light flavor refreshing, the apricots getting on well with the cocoa.   The waitstaff was exceedingly friendly and competent. It is also worth mentioning that with all of the racial discrimination lawsuits against restaurants making the news lately, it was very encouraging to see that The Porch employs a good number of African-American servers. In fact, around half of the waiters and waitresses were black, and everyone we saw appeared to be enthusiastic about working for such a brilliant new restaurant. I hope that The Porch achieves national recognition for their food, environment, and progressive hiring practices.",

After realizing that I had to leave earlier than expected, the waitress kindly and quickly boxed my meal and gave me the check. The pizza itself was a bit light on toppings and flavor with the crust being a bit gummy (maybe from having to pull it early because I had to leave?), but it did it's job. I'll probably come back again when I have more time and try another plate.",

    "text": "I recently returned to The Porch with a large group, so we ordered from a banquet menu of sorts. The staff were super friendly and made sure we got in and out in time for our show later.  We started with a Caesar salad which was okay. I liked that they weren't too heavy in the dressing (though I would have preferred it without). Also, I didn't really think the size of the plate was appropriate. If you take a look at the picture, the salad seems very small. I ordered the veggie burger.   The burger itself contains 36 different vegetables, and it is topped with greens and an aioli. It came with potatoes and ketchup. I mention the ketchup because it isn't what comes out of a Heinz bottle. I have no idea how to describe it, but their ketchup is really good. The potatoes can be a little salty, but I enjoyed their crispy outsides. The burger itself was good, but nothing great. The bun stayed dry and firm as I ate, which is always a plus.   Lastly, we had blood orange sorbet for dessert. My first thought was, \"Wow, this is sweet,\" but it was fine after I got used to it. My friend said that she couldn't guess what flavor it was last time she was there. Still, it was refreshing and a welcome treat on a warm day.  Although The Porch has improved in my standings somewhat, its type of food isn't really what I usually want, and it's more expensive than other places in the Oakland area. I wouldn't mind returning, but it's not somewhere I'd suggest going.",

Their menu is simple ingredients executed in a straight forward way. Even though another reviewer deemed it \"disgusting,\" I loved the way the pizzas were served on a baking sheet with piles of cheese and spices carefully arranged on the end. The calamari was the best dish of the night, but I also enjoyed the Piggie Pie with a fried egg on top. Mmm! Great casual place to spend a lovely evening.   Their beer taps are limited but carefully and deliciously selected. They do have happy hour prices on booze but it's at the bar only. After 9:30 on weekdays, they do half price pizzas, but I'm pretty sure that's a bar only thing too.   As for service, our waiter was a bit cold at first, but he gradually warmed up. My first piggie pie was overcooked so much that the egg yolk was solid and someone even cut off the burnt crust in an effort to hide their error. Thankfully, the waiter noticed this and assured me that he would bring me a fresh pie, but brought me the first one to take home if I wanted. Now that's good customer service!",

We were greeted right away by our super perky server.   For drinks, BJ opted for a seasonal beer and I ordered a pineapple sage margarita.  I love this drink, so good!!  BJ ordered the chorizo & eggs.  He thought it was okay.  But he really liked the fried potatoes.  I loved his meal.  I sampled.  I got the Rocket salad.  I loved the roasted beet and the Sherry vinaigrette.  I thought the chorizo was a little tough.   We decided to get the cookies for a sweet little treat.  We were told we would get 6 and we even got to pick what kind, 3 peanut butter cookies and 3 white chocolate, macadamia nut & cranberry.  Somehow, we only ended up with 5.  We were missing one cookie.  We asked our server about our missing cookie and she couldn't come up with a satisfactory answer.  Kinda of a strange ending to an otherwise good meal.",

    "text": "Here is the objective debate of the self-righteous foodie: I struggle between the complications of the two-star shatter and the three-star one-thumbs-up of approval.  I've been here various times since opening and have had a chance to try breakfast, lunch, dinner, and casual drinks. The appetizers are all delicious and offer fresh options in an area riddled with deep-fried and over-processed (not that there's anything wrong with that). The pizzas are crafted with care, the entrees are a little expensive, but everything is nothing less than delicious. Solid beer choices. Excellent cocktails (try the Almost Arnie). The servers are nice, and this makes up for the long-ish wait times I've had to experience.  Breakfast is a let-down. I got a breakfast sandwich (house-baked bread, fresh-tasting fried egg, ham) and a no-cream-no-sugar coffee (but was given the creamed-and-sugared option instead). It took whoever attended the window a few glances and knocks to realize someone wanted his business, he didn't get my order correct, didn't include a napkin in the bag, blah blah complain--but it was tasty.  Yes, I caved in and gave it three stars. With an innovative (aspiring, creative) head chef, fresh ingredients, a quality menu, and nice servers, this place just needs a little work to be everything it can be (believe in your dreams, reach for the stars, anything is possible). I'll probably get another breakfast sandwich soon and I'll definitely stop in for drinks or snacks again to see how well they've improved the non-food side of things.",

They only bring you the food. But then that's ok. I ordered Bianca pizza and Porch Reuben. Bianca Pizza was by far the least delicious thing I have ever had in my entire life. It was bread and then it was arugula. That's it. The Reuben sandwich was also meh, very normal and nothing special. The only good part was the potatoe. I had been here for brunch and I do recommend it for that, but for a proper meal this place is aweful and I won't have a lunch here ever again.",

    "text": "For real?? Did this place REALLY open up in the heart of Oakland, Cathedral of Learning adjacent??? Never in my life did I want to reapply to Pitt and become a student all over again so I could experience this place every day. How lucky are these guys?!  When I say smack in the middle of Oakland, I mean it. So much so that I actually drove past it, thinking that it would be off the cut a bit. The style/vibe here is casual, do-it yourself, easy eating. 1. You Pick up a Menu. 2. You Order and Pay. 3. You Grab a Seat. 4. Your Food is Delivered to you table.  WOW, what a concept!  The seating inside is very ample, from cozy booths that overlook the lawn and library, to bistro tables in the center.  There are even larger tables for families. They also serve wine and beer. There are two green glass water coolers, one labeled H20, the other \"fancy\" water- infused with lemon and mint! Is it normal that I was getting excited about the water before I actually consumed anything?  The food came out quickly, nice and hot. I ordered the Farm Stand Vegetable burger with greens. The patty was chock-full of colors: carrots, bell peppers, red peppers. Nice texture, DElish. It was topped with kalamata olives, lettuce, tomatoes, and a type of sun dried aoli. My two dining pals ordered the Chicken Roti, with pear, pesto, Swiss cheese and aoli (um, YUMMM?? I could eat this sandwich every day of my life) and Grilled Cheese with Almond soup. OH, and I cannot forget the POTATOES. They are phenomenal- crisp and savory on the outside and soooo tender on the outside. all the way down to the cumin ketchup. Unfortunately I did not have a chance to try the Almond Soup, as my friend was lapping it up at warp speed. A clear sign of deliciousness.  As much as I loved my veggie burger, I had a slight bit of buyers envy over the Chicken Roti. The flavors are SO clean and unique.  I'm not sure whose brilliance is behind the launch of the Porch, but they deserve many kudos. It is the perfect addition to the campus, and inexpensive! Its nice to know that students can now eat wholesome good food at a good prices. It seems like it would be a great place to bring parents when they are out of town as well. Parking could be tough, but it's worth the extra effort to find a spot (or, jump on the bus, as all of them pretty much drop you off a block away).",

For $10, he was given three slices of bread that were somehow both burnt around the edges and un-toasted in the center plus the fattiest, most inedible pork belly I've ever seen.   My daughter ordered french toast off the children's menu, which was brought over with no syrup, compote, etc.  The waiter also disappeared after serving our food, so we were never able to order syrup for my daughter (who was left with two of the most tasteless slices of french toast I've ever tried) and no coffee. We also ran out of water and were never offered a refill.   We ended up asking one of the other servers to please find our server so we could get the check.   Overall, the food was mediocre at best and the service was absolutely horrid.",

    "text": "I was headed to a computer lab around lunchtime today when I noticed the building lit up at the edge of Schenley Park in Oakland -- was it open?  Having seen the construction progress along throughout the spring and summer months, I was anxious to sit down and give this brand spanking new restaurant a try.  First surprise: it is NOT a full-service restaurant.  When I walked in, I was promptly greeted and two hostesses handed me a menu.  They directed me to go to the register when I was ready to order. The menu looked fresh, seasonal, and original, and consisted of salads, sanwiches, soup, and wood-fired pizzas.  All of the sandwiches come with either greens or crispy taters with curry ketchup -- more on that later.    I finally settled on a sandwich -- The Roasted Pig -- pork roast, carmelized onions, ricotta, and red pepper aioli, and I wanted to try both of the sides so I asked for the greens and paid for a side of the crispy taters.  In all, my meal was around $13.  If I had gotten anything to drink other than water I imagine it would have topped $15.  They gave me a number with my order, as they bring the food to your table.  Second surprise: The \"water bar.\"  I just wanted water with lunch and the girl who took my order pointed me towards a spot on the bar with two larges containers of water -- one with cucumbers and one with lemon.  You can help yourself to all you like of either.  The flavored water was a nice touch.  The Porch is seat yourself, and I found a table with a great view of the park and a bench seat -- it was roomy and comfortable.  I waited about 10 minutes for my food to arrive, and the greens looked fresh and bright, the bread was crisp and chewy at the same time, and the potatoes looked divine.  First thing to try: the greens.  They were tasty and clearly very fresh, if a little bit on the salty side.  I'm not sure WHAT they are tossed in, but it was light and tasty.  (I hate when I go to a restaurant and they give me OLD greens/lettuce in my salad, it is such a huge turnoff!)    Next: A bite of those potatoes.  The crispy taters weren't exactly what I expected them to be -- the work tater put \"tater tots\" into my brain, but these were fresh, small potatoes, diced kind of like homefries and seasoned.  And on the side was the curry ketchup.  Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE curry: the curry ketchup is GENIUS!  The curry gives a little kick of spice and a something extra to the ketchup, and the seasoned potatoes, while good by themselves, were really something special with a dab of the curry ketchup on them.  Note: If you're not a fan of curry, you CAN request regular ketchup.  And then my sandwich: I can't claim it was a flavor explosion in my mouth, but the bread was toasted just the right amound and the onions were sweet and tasty.  The pork was flavorful and the texture was spot-on.  It wasn't really messy, althought the last couple bites kind of fell apart a bit and the cheese didn't stay on the sandwich well...  Speaking of which, I couldn't really taste the cheese (although the type of cheese on the sandwich was a mild one), so the one thing I would change if I were making the sandwiches would be to use a sharper, \"stickier\" cheese that would also help hold the sandwich together.  Someone came by and refilled my water glass several times throughout my meal and another person took my plate away when I was done eating.  The staff was friendly and attentive and no one acted like they were just there to do a job.    While I didn't have any alcoholic beverages, there was a beer and wine list and The Porch also makes fresh seasonal soda to order.  Overall, a nice place, and definetly somewhere I would take a friend for a casual lunch.",

But I've been here three times since it opened (most recently for brunch this past weekend) and I just haven't been impressed.   The design of the restaurant itself is great. It perfectly fits that whole rustic-yet-trendy thing that is popular right now. It feels very open inside and that it would be better situated next to a lake or beach. The outside area (I suppose \"porch\" would be the proper word here) is also very nice. There is a generous amount of seating outside which is hard to come by.   On my most recent trip, I ordered the chorizo and eggs. I love chorizo, so I figured this would be an unquestionably good choice. Not so, unfortunately. The chorizo was a very tiny, almost ball-like patty. It was dry and did not have the level of spice I would expect from chorizo.   The two eggs were prepared sunny side up. Nothing special here. There was some thick bread served on the side for dipping. It was pretty hard and bland.   The third item was maple-bacon sweet potato hash. I liked this idea, and the flavor was good, but the potatoes were a little undercooked.   On previous trips I have had pizza (this was good), and a soup/sandwich combination for lunch (decent). I'll probably continue to try the Porch from time to time since I have friends who love it, but maybe it's just not for me!",

During the weeknights, The Porch has their half off pizza special from 9pm to 11pm. This is when I go to take advantage of the cheap deals. I had the opportunity to try three pizzas: bbq chicken, asparagus tocino and shrimp zucchini. My least favorite was the bbq chicken, which replaced tomato sauce with straight up bbq sauce. The bbq sauce was way too overpowering. My ultimate favorite was the asparagus tocino, which has huge chunks of bacon and a garlicky crust. The shrimp zucchini was a bit bland.   Overall, my experience at The Porch was enjoyable. It's a great place to meet up with friends, but not somewhere I would go out of the way to get to. Do take advantage of the half off pizza deals!",

I had the pulled pork sandwich which came with apple slaw and delicious beer battered onion rings;  it was probably one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I have ever had. It comes with whole fried baby potatoes that are super crunchy on the outside and creamy and soft on the inside. The portions are huuuuuge here so if you aren't super hungry one sandwich could probably feed 2 people. I went with a group of people and everyone seemed to enjoy their dish. I heard the pizza is also awesome.",

If I could rewind 7 years, Pitt would have been on my radar of colleges to attend and The Porch would most definitely be a frequent stop for me.   My friend and I stopped in for brunch Sunday and it was a pretty rainy day, but that didn't stop us from sitting outside. All thanks to the covered porch, we were able to enjoy our brunch outdoors facing the park. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with crispy potatoes and it was very delightful! You can't go wrong with crispy potatoes and the curry ketchup gave the potatoes a nice kick of flavor. My friend ordered the Eggs Benedict and a Bloody Mary. Our food came out very fast and the service was great! The only thing that might be a bit of a pain is the parking, but in my opinion The Porch is definitely worth trying!",

He was raving about their pizzas and the prime rib sandwich... So he ordered a prime rib sandwich but I really want mashed potatoes so I ordered braised beef cheeks.   The food was awesome. The meat was tender, a bit bland but complements well with the olives. The mashed potatoes was really smooth and creamy, though I think the white truffle oil overpowered it a bit. You really need the olive bits, glazed carrots and caramelized onions to cut the fat and get a great balanced bite. :)",

I have had the desert here and the tiramisu was fantastic.  But this was the first time that I have actually eaten dinner near.  It was mediocre at best.  I ordered the firefly fries, the seafood chowder (which was the soup of the day), and a salmon dish .  The firefly fries were the best part of the meal.  The unique idea of shaving roast beef and putting on fries was different, yet delicious.  The beef was juicy and tender.  I generally don't like roast but this was an exception.  Then the soup.  It wasn't very good and I didn't taste any seafood.  In fact, it tasted frozen and bland.  I've had better chowder at a church fish fry.  Then the salmon came.  It was over cooked and it looked like there was more time preparing a garnish than making the fish.  The bacon was disgusting.  The Yukon potatoes left more to be desired.   The carrots were bland.  The salmon tasted pretty good, but the taste and portion size certainly weren't worth the twenty two dollars that the porch charged.  All in all, a pretty overpriced, yet basic experience that has its highs, but very few of them.",

    "text": "I really wanted to come here and decided to grab a bite around 4pm on a Sunday. Brunch was technically over and it wasn't too busy. It didn't stay quiet for long. We were seated at a round table for two people that was in between bigger tables meant for groups. What happened was we felt sandwiched between two bigger groups and didn't like how close we were to everyone else. It definitely got busy for dinner so now I know not to go at that time.  Our waitress was prompt to get water. My friend ordered a berry cobbler with coffee and I got the maple pork belly and bianca pizza, which I knew I would get a to-go box for. The waitress clarified with me that I wanted the pork belly to come out before pizza. I got the pizza first and my friend was approached by a waitress holding an apple pie versus the cobbler. There was some mix up, but everything eventually came out. My friend's cobbler was cold in the middle, burnt on the sides, and tasted gelatin-like in the center as if to say it was sitting out for a while. I did taste it and it wasn't good. She sent it back.  The bianca pizza was unlike anything I've ever had before. It had fig jam, goat cheese, arugula, and black truffle oil. The way it smelled was amazing so I was excited to take a bite. I was definitely pleased with the combination of flavors. My favorite thing about the pizza was the way it was served on a metal pan with some pepper flakes and cheese just on the side in little piles. I added pepper to my pizza and I loved it even more after that. I think this is now my favorite pizza.  Since my pork belly came out after the pizza, I tried it after I had a slice. It had pumpkin polenta, roasted pears, walnuts, and brie. The presentation was appealing. I didn't particularly like how fatty the pork was, but it still carried a great flavor on its own and mixed in with all of the flavors on my plate. Our waitress didn't come back after bringing our plates so my friend had to flag her down for additional coffee and a to-go box for me. While she wasn't rude or anything, I didn't find our waitress to be helpful or attentive. I would still come back to try out other items on any other day but Sunday at 4pm, but I would ask to be seated at a different table.",

The salad was $10, and its probably one of the lower priced items (besides soup) if you dont want to spend too much. I suggest they serve the salad with some bread on the side.

Many wonderful things have been done with potatoes but sometimes simple is best. And The Porch proves it.   Take a whole bunch of small, whole potatoes, deep fry them to perfection, serve with a side of curry ketchup. Let us have a moment of silence.   So simple. Sooooo good.   I like this place a lot. Great outdoor seating, ample indoor seating, cool decor with an easy feel. Nice servers, nice presentation, healthy drink menu, good location and lots of interesting  items on the menu.  We were not told the specials, didn't like that.  They're specials so treat them special and tell me about them.   I had the crab cakes, lots of crab, but not cooked right. Mushy. To wet. But the lentils and slaw were really great.   One of my dinner partners had ribs with the whole potatoes. He was a happy, finger lickin man. Moist inside, crispy rubbed outside, with a piece of grilled pineapple on top.   Also at our table, the chorizo pesto  pizza. Nice size, he ate it himself, smiled the whole time.  Pecan encrusted halibut. Cooked perfectly. Moderate potion.  Fried green tomatoes. Apparently not the best she ever had, but still good.   Five of us got out of there at $102.00 I think that's great- average of $20 a person. No drinks, all water and a coffee, no apps or deserts.   That's it.   Now, go love a potato.   .",

We had corn bread, the Bianca Pizza (Fig Jam, Goat Cheese, Arugula, Black Truffle Oil), and the Rib Eye (w/ cheddar mashed potatoes, in a creamy rosemary mushroom sauce made with cumin, brandy, and peppercorns). Everything had layerings of flavors and textures- all of the dishes were exciting!  The rib eye was KILLER!! If the rib eye didn't disappear with the summer menu, I would recommend getting it right now!  You can tell that the ingredients here are of quality and are fresh- and apparently everything is made in house. The chef even has a roof garden to grow items for the menu! They also pride themselves on sourcing locally where possible. How awesome is that?! Supporting other local Pittsburgh businesses is something I can get behind!  The ambiance and style of this place is also really cool- it is a modern, cool mix of industrial and natural elements. The design allows for the building to nicely blend into the park atmosphere. And as an added bonus, it has a porch and patio- perfect to enjoy a beautiful day in the park!   We also had great attentive service.   This place deserves a visit!",

The menu is always very thin and most of the selections are not to my liking. $32 ($16 per person) for breakfast/brunch is a little high. No extras. Just and omelette, pancakes & two coffees.  What The Porch needs to focus on is customer service and ticket times. 30 mins for an omelette and pancakes to arrive! You would expect slow service if the Porch was under staffed but there were servers in each section and four people working in the kitchen.  This is where management needs to jump in and assist somehow. Deliver the food if the servers are backed up and talk to the customers that are sitting there waiting for a long time. I witnessed the manager talk to a couple for at least 15 minutes while people sat and sat for a long time with no food. The discussion did not seem to be about a slow ticket time. Then once he ended the conversation, he disappeared.   There was no sense of urgency or care for the patrons. Our server barely checked on us. We had to ask another server for our check and my father had to actually go to the counter to ask for a refill on our coffee. I don't think we'll be going back. It's a shame because the Porch has potential. Being part of the Eat & Park family, there should be enough experience in the hospitality industry to provide knowledgeable, attentive staff and proper training.",

Their alcoholic twist on an Arnold Palmer was great. I applaud anyone who makes their own limoncello.  Sitting at the bar is fun on the kitchen side, because you get to see all the action and feel the warm glow of their oven. Servers are still very friendly, of course. I really got a kick out of seeing menus cut up and recycled as bar coasters.  Be warned though - their bar only had the ingredients to make the cocktails on their menu. Full bar isn't quite accurate. It's probably due to space, but I hope this changes. I look forward to a nice gin cocktail on the outside porch on a hot day.  Small update: went back for brunch again - had the biscuits and gravy and a seasonal soda. The soda was apple ginger and AMAZING. I say again AMAZING. The biscuits and gravy was too much food, and made me feel like a glutton, but that's my own dietary mistake. I could only eat 3 out of the 4 homemade biscuits before giving up.",

However, the food plays second fiddle to the atmosphere in my opinion.  Having tried various soups, salads, and sandwiches (which are just OK for the price) I think the way to go here is with the wood-fired pizza that they make in their own oven.  Pizzas are pretty large although one person could finish it off....this is pretty much my go-to option here now (even for brunch.)",

    "text": "The Porch has officially become one of my future \"go to\" spots for casual dinning. When friends come to visit my family we will be taking them to The Porch. Even though The Porch provides a relaxed casual environment just like many others, what sets this place apart from the rest is the aesthetics and location. I'll get to these in a moment.  First the service is cheerful, happy and a delight. Exactly what you might expect being located near two major universities. However, the wait staff are not typical \"I don't care nor do I want to try\" college age kids who are just working for spending money. They are professional and patient. The food was excellent. I was told by many to get their homemade pizza but I couldn't resist the lamb special. I would not expect a place like this to serve lamb let alone a lamb dish this great), but this goes to show the range The Porch has. Fortunately others in my group order the pizza and I got to try. It was a perfectly dry crust (not greasy) and a delicious artistic pizza. You cannot go wrong with any of them. The beverages have a great range of wines, beers and spirits. Whats especially great is their use of local breweries. Utilizing local products is always a big plus in my book.   Now for location and aesthetics. The location is excellent. Right near Pitt and CMU and the Natural History Museum. The landscape is beautiful, and as a parent of an almost 3 year old boy, having the huge groomed field away from the streets was a blessing. With nice weather you can safely let your kids run around within eye sight. So parents, bring your kids run around and tire them out before dinner. The decor was great. Very warm and inviting and fitting to the culture of The Porch. I love seeing the Edison light bulbs in use. Big open doors and windows and a fire place outside that I cannot wait to use this winter.   Again, this is a great place for casual \"let's go out for dinner\" dinners. No additional thought needed to plan ahead. Show up and relax.   As I used in previous reviews, I will use the 5 senses guide (1-10) to guide you in your decision to go.  Sight: 8- beautiful scenery of the university and the architecture and decor. Sound: 6-outside you can hear each other well, but inside on a busy night, it can get a bit noisy,  Taste: 8- the lamb helped this. Again, surprised by it, an the pizzas a a hit. Touch: 4 - it is a restaurant so this is never a high score unless you eat exclusively with your hands, but as said before the pizza in perfectly dry, no oily/greasy crusts to battle. Smell: 7 - with good food comes good smells.",

According to Porch website, the menu said that Egg Benedict is served with crispy taters or field greens. Yes, this was what I used to get, but not anymore. I checked the food and I found out that there was no crispy taters or field greens. I asked the server who gave me the food and he said that neither crispy taters or field greens is served with Egg Benedict anymore. Also, the image of the Egg Benedict on Porch website was totally different from the real food they make. They don't use ham anymore. Basically they are lying on their menu. Two Egg Benedicts without any sides do not worth $14.   Also, the service was not great. I had to wait several minutes in front of a register several minutes. There were servers who were standing in front of the register and saw me. The servers were only interested in other jobs such as cleaning the countertop, not in taking an order from a customer.   Most likely, I will not go back to Porch anymore.",

    "text": "Eat N Park. The old Pittsburgh chain establishment is like that guy you knew in college. We all knew that guy. He would wear nothing but Nittany Lion hoodies and ripped jeans all the time. He would wake up at 11, skip class, eat ramen noodles, nap until 5, order a pizza, and be ready for the party by 10. 90% of the time, this kid was a pleasure to be around. Funny, endearing, yet ultimately harmless. But that other 10% of the time, he would be utterly obnoxious. Having a bit too much drink, hitting on your girl, getting into bro fights, calling your cell phone at 3am because he needs to be bailed out of jail, etc. And when he would act up, it would make you not want to hang out with him (or her) for the next 3 months.  Flash forward five years. You're downtown and you run into this guy. He's still got the same personality but he looks...different. He's graduated, has gotten a job, is dressing better. You can tell he's been hitting the gym. And he still likes to party, but in moderation, with Christmas Ales taking the place of Keystone Light and bourbon cocktails taking the place of Vladimir out of a paper bag. This is the Porch in a nutshell.  Southern Tier Christmas Ale was awesome. Farm Bread was awesome. Prime Rib was done to perfection.   I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to see Eat N Park all grown up.",

The decor is nouveau Eat 'n Park, but the cuisine is anything but.  At the fervent recommendation of so many Yelpers, we began our meal with the Farm Bread.  Those Yelpers really know what they're talking about. This bread was more like a fine steak; sliced thick and cooked to perfection. Served with a trio of condiments, including apple butter and the sweetest butter you've ever tasted, this orgasmic appetizer kicked our meal off to a tremendous start.  For my entree, I ordered the evening's special; pan-seared Grouper with a side of pistachio puree, artichokes and beans.  I loathe beans (First world problems), but the chef was kind enough to substitute spaghetti squash instead. From first bite, I was in love.  The Grouper was PERFECT as was each of the sides on which it lay atop.  Jonathan had the prime rib and seemed pretty happy with his choice. But given that I'm encouraging him to Yelp more, I'll leave it at that.",

And if you think that waiting on an endless line for brunch is the only option, clearly it's because The Porch hasn't caught on enough yet.-but their homemade hashbrown ball things will kick your hangovers butt and it's dimly/naturally lit in there for after a long night...which is obviously ideal.   Their pizzas are perfect, but I'm partial to the Pizza Bianca, figs and melted goat cheese? Yes please! (Especially at their happy hour pricing) Their donut and desserts are tasty and warming and consuming on the patio by the fire on an autumn evening is an awesome way to end the night- if you don't happen to be sitting near a table of screaming children that refuse to sit....this place seems to attract a lot of young families, which good for them, but teach them how to behave in public for goodness sake.    But I digress, there are plenty of creative and tasty salad options for that person always on a diet and some really great indulgences for everyone else.  I think it's the perfect location and a really great addition to Oakland.  Definitely one of the best options in the area.  Plus they have great wine and beer selections to take out onto the patio during those summer concerts.",

Lunch is reliably good, particularly the sandwiches and pizza. I've gone routinely and the food is tasty.  Service.. Well, service is not always that great. I've gone and it's been fine. And I've gone some times where they forget to give you silverware or a glass for your ice tea until you ask for it. (No joke. A few weeks ago I came with some friends and the guy came with a bottle of ice tea, stood there for a minute and I had to say \"well, could I get a class for the tea?\")  Dinner. Well.. not really as good as lunch, honestly. I've been several times as well. Some dishes are usually tasty (e.g., the roasted chicken) but there have been some just crazy things.  A friend said she's been several times for dinner and usually orders soup. No matter the kind of soup, it's so salty she needs to pour water from her glass to eat it. (Yes, I've seen her do this. Yes, it was very salty.) Why go to a restaurant when the soup is worse than a can of Progresso?!  And then there was the bread salad.. which was bread and bread and a few sprigs of endive.  I won't go into the time I went for dinner and had to order three times because the first two dishes were out. (Ok, I can understand once, but the poor waiter should have been told \"here's everything we're out tonight.\")  I'll also leave out the sometimes surly wait staff. Just please get some better people?  So that's the story... sometimes fine, sometimes totally crazy and disappointing.  Hope they can get it together. It's a great location, a nice atmosphere, and usually tasty food.",

The Porch at Schenley Park happens to be one of these places and we were lucky enough to fit a visit into our schedule... this time - for Breakfast!  I cannot begin to tell you how excited we were because the dinner we had here awhile back was simply epic.  Now, breakfast is done a tad bit differently as the inside dining room is not open to the public; however you place your order at a ginormous window that reminded me of the Wizard of Oz.  It seemed as if all the answers to everything in life were right behind that window - in this case; it was the BEST answer to my grumbling tummy!    We had the two of their breakfast delicacies - a hearty slab of freshly baked fluffy and tasty sourdough (made in house), split open and stuffed with over-medium local free-range eggs (SO good), fresh butchered and smoked bacon (butchering done in house) and flavored to Chef Kevin's liking; then drizzled with melted Vermont cheddar... orgasmic!  Next up, we again enjoyed that insanely soft sourdough; but this time smeared with homemade raspberry jam and honey butter (unreal), then stuffed with prosciutto, Parmesan cheese and topped with juicy eggs! WIN... WIN... WIN...!  After begging a little bit, management did me the honor of making me those addictive Smashed Potatoes that I have had on my mind for over a year - Yukon Gold potatoes smashed and fried to perfection.  LOVE them.  I have to say that we enjoyed our dining for a second time at The Porch; fresh food - fresh coffee - great start me up! If you are a student or work in the area, I'd start my day off there as often as possible if I were you.  Also, I'd watch out for their Brunch served starting at 10am on Saturdays and Sundays... that is next on our list!",

    "text": "This was a VERY disappointing visit to The Porch.  I've eaten here before and usually have decent food and mediocre service but tonight I had terrible service and subpar food.  We ordered a bacon and eggs pizza with bacon on half of the pizza and crispy potatoes for an appetizer.  The potatoes took an exceptionally long time for an appetizer, 30-40 minutes and the pizza took an additional 20-30 after that.  The restaurant wasn't incredibly busy so I'm not sure why the food took so long.  The pizza arrived with an egg, sunny side up, in the center and what looked to be bacon on 1/2.  Upon biting into the pizza we noticed that there was bacon hidden under the egg and cheese on 5/6 slices.  When we called the waitress over she tried to say that we were mistaking the cheese as bacon and pointed to our pizza saying \"that's just how the cheese looks.\"  When we assured her that there were in fact large chunks of bacon under the egg and cheese she offered to get us a new, completely meatless pizza, for 1/2 price.  I expressed hesitation because I didn't think I should have to pay for a new pizza and she left to refill our waters and get a manager.  When the manager came over she asked what the problem was and said that \"she only put bacon on 3 slices\" and \"it was put in the oven 1/2 meatless.\"  She seemed angry that my boyfriend had continued to eat the pizza and asked if we wanted it half bacon because \"we didn't like bacon?.\"  I explained that I was a vegetarian, but occasionally eat eggs, and she said \"okay well what do you want from us?.\"  She eventually offered me a side salad which was ONLY lettuce with a VERY vinegary dressing on top (It tasted like pure vinegar to my friends and I and we didn't eat it).  Meanwhile the other servers kept confusing our table with other tables and trying to bring us food that wasn't ours (it happened 4 times) and our water was still missing after 45 minutes.  Our server, though apologetic and kind, seemed overwhelmed and took an extensive amount of time bringing us our checks at the end.    Overall it was poor customer service on the manager's part and greasy salty food.  The manager was aggressive, uncompromising, and unapologetic.  The pizza was very greasy and left everyone who had a slice feeling nauseous after the meal.  We were at the restaurant for almost 2 hours in all even though we only spent 30 minutes eating.",

As I took my seat I was startled because my backless bar stool had uneven legs. After sampling the first special (grilled shrimp) I was upset that it was not actually an Eat n' Park. The plate had fruits and veggies which were cold and adorned with fabricated grill marks, the heads of the shrimp were presented on the plate detached from the cooked bodies, uncooked cumquats were also involved although how they contributed to the flavor of the dish I'm not positive. I was appalled that anyone could confidently put that on a menu thinking customers would be pleased. We asked the waiting staff about the salad option named something similar to a bread basket. The staff informed us there are no greens involved only starches in this particular salad. I felt that was extremely misleading and would fit better under the appetizer heading. We both settled on a beet salad trying to keep things as simple as possible.The salad was something I could have made better at home. Underwhelming, under dressed, and in no way pleasing. It seems to be a lack luster pizza joint which is ironic because Pittsburgh does pizza so well.",

The decor is fantastic and the atmosphere very homey.  The restaurant overlooks Schenley Park and offers outdoor seating during warm weather.  The food was mixed and showed its Eat N' Park roots.  We ordered a pan of the sticky buns to split with our coffee.  They were on special, but they were overly doughy and flavorless.  The icing was bitter.  Overall not even up to the standards of its parent company.    Two of us had chorizo and eggs.  The eggs were a little bland and the chorizo as well.  The crispy taters were spot on with a tasty curry ketchup.  The pico de gallo on the side was very well done.  Overall average.  My other friend ordered the Eggs Benedict special.  The eggs were horribly overcooked, solid throughout.  Bernaise sauce was delicious but the entire thing was on a hamburger bun instead of an English muffin.  Needless to say he was not impressed.  Overall a nice location and an interesting option on Pitt's campus, but average an brunch in a great setting.",

I wasn't expecting you to order a window but it makes the process a bit quicker and I can see how it works for students in the area. I had their thin crust pizza and thought it was great. It's nice that they have fruity flavored water for free in their main lobby and also the service was great, the food came out quickly for how many people were in the area!",

First, as we sat down at a table in the center of the restaurant we were greeted by an overwhelming, unpleasant odor of rot. It was uncertain if this was coming from other guests' food or not. From there, we ordered two different pizzas that were exceptionally underwhelming. There was no real difference in taste between a margherita pizza and a butternut squash pizza because the ingredients were all so bland.   Overall, I would recommend avoiding this restaurant. Its convenient because it bills itself as a nice, real restaurant in walking distance from CMU and Pitt but parents beware- its worth a little further of a trip to avoid eating here.",

When asked for horseradish for prime rib, the response was that it comes with the plate, only to find out that the sauce has a tiny amount of horseradish that u can barely taste. The staff was inexperienced and we had to ask mutiple times for simple things that you shouldn't have to ask for...like refills, a pen to sign your name, the receipt, etc. The atmostphere was OK I guess, but the meal was barely acceptable.

    "text": "I was looking for a casual-ish place to entertain business partners.  The parameters: decent bar options, food for picky eaters, dieters, as well as the slightly adventurous, and not about the break the bank.   I walked away from a fairly decadent meal for about $30 a head including tip and tax.  Not bad.  Not bad at all.  Location: great neighborhood for those who know it, right by Pitt, CMU, and the Carnegie institute.  Street parking can be a bit of a pain.  And don't try finding the restaurant on your GPS- it's technically in a park, but it's visible from Forbes Street.  If you're doing an event here for folks out of town, be sure to give good directions about travel and parking.  Appetizers:  I ordered plates of meat and vegetarian antipasti for the table with two cornbread skillets.  The food was appropriate for our table and there were small plates already out- but why no serving utensils?  Also- the cornbread skillet is somewhat awkwardly sized-- it's way too big, buttery, and dense for one person, too large to be romantic for two, probably more appropriate for four people to share, but it feels small.  I don't know.  I would almost prefer it if they did single-serve cornbread pieces that were a third the size of the cornbread dishes.  Entrees- I was quite pleased with my scallops (well-seasoned, kind of unexpected combination with roasted pumpkins, I believe?)  and my table mates seemed pleased with their pizza (nice presentation on the pizza) and their hamburgers and veggie burger.  Atmosphere: mostly a young adult crowd, kind of felt like a fresh twist on a diner.  Modern decor I found fitting, great park views, but the MUSIC! Top 40's dreck playing a bit too loudly for my taste.  If I'm back in the area I'll definitely consider doing another meal here, but as far as I'm concerned this is not a place I'll go out of my way to visit again.",

    "text": "I have never written a review for a restaurant on Yelp before, but The Porch has disappointed me so many times, that I just had to post one.  In my opinion, the worst thing about the Porch is their service.  Their bartender, in addition to being rude and inappropriate toward females, cannot seem to handle more than 6 people at the bar. Take last week, for example.  I went on a Thursday night to have a glass of wine and a pizza while I waited for a friend.  After 30 minutes of not getting my pizza but also not being able to locate the bartender who took my order, I finally tracked him down and asked about my pizza.  His response was to roll his eyes, not say anything, and walk away.  He sent a different server out to handle his mistake.  She said that my food was \"misplaced.\"  After another 10 minutes, my food finally came.  No apology.  He came back and told me that the kitchen was unreliable and that his bar got out of hand.  There were six people there.  Six.  I'd hate to see what happens when it's actually busy.  When my friends finally met up with me, he seemed completely put out that they each wanted to start their own tabs.  I'm not sure what else they were supposed to ask for when ordering a drink at the bar.  When it comes to their menu, I don't get it.  What do they \"do?\"  They have pizza, they have burgers, but then they also try to have pseudo-fancy meals that are completely sub-par.  For what you get and how it tastes, their prices are ridiculous.  I have given The Porch multiple tries, and I just can't do it anymore.  Sorry!",

My dining companion was traveling for work, and he had dined at The Porch three times in a matter of three weeks....I don't think he's even dined at any one place in Boston that much (so that's saying something).   We sat outside for dinner one summer evening, and the view of the Cathedral of Learning and Schenley Plaza was lovely.   While we were sitting down to eat, we ran into a native Pittsburghian (Pittsburgher?), who told us that The Porch was one of he and his wife's favorite dining spots. He recommended the Prime Rib Sandwich, and I totally deferred to his expertise, and was not disappointed!   The meat was succulent and tasty, and the curried flavored potatoes were to die for! I also got the Porch Pink Lemonade, and it was smooth and delightful.   If I lived in Pitt, I would come back to the Porch again and again. Totally worth it!",

Most of the time I order pizza, potatoes with curried ketchup, or vegetarian burger. Overall, the pizza flavors are absolutely amazing! By far, my favorite is the Bianca which has a balance of flavors: nutty slightly bitter arugula with fig jam is a True winning combination! However, I can't help but note that the pizza does seem quite soggy. Pick up a slice, and youll need extra care to make sure the toppings to slide off because of the \"limpness\" of the slice. Still, the pizza tastes great. They have definitely nailed their potatoes, and the curried ketchup is something I always crave whenever I want French fries. Regarding the vegetarian burger, I like the variation in texture: some parts are crispy, probably from some fried nut, and the soft \"tender\" texture of mashed beans go well together. Overall, I love the flavors of foods offered here, and I'm always looking forward to late night pizzas (1/2 off!) with friends.",

I have been here on several occasions and I would say that the quality of the food has moderately improved over time, though it is hard to change a poor first impression. The first time I came here, I ordered the smoked salmon salad, which was appalling. There were pickled lemon rinds which were sour, sweet, and so bitter that they overpowered the salad. I also found dollops of creamy dressing which only transformed the mushy salad into a wet one.  The second time I visited, I had the roasted chicken, which was cooked well, but tasted way too salty. Similarly, I recently tried their scallops which also tasted strongly of salt. On each of my last two visits, I single-handedly downed an entire jug of water. However, I would say that the dishes on a holistic scale are better composed than they once were.   The restaurant itself is modern, clean, and a pleasant place to visit while hanging out in Schenley Plaza. I would say that the Porch has the potential to be a really great restaurant. Still, there is a lot of room for improvement, particularly when it comes to seasoning.",

The issue is that it covers too many cultures with not enough specialization. The pizza ranges from 14-16 dollars, and as an Italian, it does not hold up to standards. A pizza of similar cost can be found at Piccolo Forno or Mercurio's for a much higher quality. Similarly, the restaurant has attempted to make things like ramen and rice dishes, but their general basic composition detriments the overall dish. A great location, good food, and a nice atmosphere, but the price is just too high for the quality and quantity of food that you receive. I recommend their pizza when it's half off at night.",

    "text": "My parents were in town staying the the Pittsburgh Veterans Hospital in Oakland for my dad's upcoming surgery. They wanted to go somewhere close but nice. I knew The Porch would be the spot for us.   Upon arrival we immediately ordered the cornbread. My mom was confused where the butter and jam was that she was used to having with her cornbread and I told her, \"Trust me mom, you do not need to add anything to this.\" My parents loved the cornbread and I soon placed an order for the fried green tomato special. Everyone acted as if they were not going to have any and with one bite they disappeared.   The dinners were also good. My mom and I split a margherita pizza as well as the grilled romaine salad with shrimp. The pizza was good and I appreciate the toppings on the side to add (cheese, red pepper flakes and dried oregano). The grilled romaine salad was also good.  The other ordered the pub burger and the pork chop and we were both equally happy with their choices.   We opted to finish the meal with coffee and creme brulee - this is where I wasn't as thrilled. The creme brulee was ok. It was super dense, rich and sweet. I've had a lot of creme brulee but this one was just a bit too much and not quite a balance of favors as I would have liked but not bad.    Also, non food related- the napkins do leave lint so 3 out of the four of us left with lint all over our pants.    Atmosphere was wonderful. The staff was also so nice and accommodating when I asked to be in quiet booth so my dad (hard of hearing) could actually hear me. After dinner we had a nice walk around Schenely Park and it was really great.   We will be back for sure!",

When we got there the hostesses seemed really perplexed about where to seat our party of 7. Welp - let us help you! We took matters into our own hands and created our own spot and said, we'll sit here. Hoping there was no blow back a few minutes later we got a great server on board. I hate I can't remember her name.   The cornbread, naked wings, ribs, homemade pasta and La Flor Cabernet I'm still searching for at my local wine shop were all good. The naked wings were the big surprise.... they packed a lot of flavor without any sauce. Not everyone can do that so two thumbs up big time. And the pasta and wine were really comforting after a cold, rainy day outside!",

The BBQ Chicken was my go-to but I think they changed the recipe a bit recently... the Butternut Squash is also one of my favorites. They used to serve their pizzas on a silver tray with parchment paper over it with the pizza on top and three sides of condiments. But now they serve them on regular round plates and sometimes the condiments aren't even offered. Also I think the pizza size became smaller because of the change in where they served their pizzas on. Still worth the half-off price than the regular price.   I came for breakfast once as well and ordered the donuts with their homemade jam. And they were amaaazing. Definitely a sweet treat to get on a weekend brunch or just to treat yourself with:)",

It's more than I would pay for pizza normally, so I tend to stick with late night if I want some pizza and save it for the next day.  The non-pizza, non-appetizer items are not great - I would not bother with them if I were you. But the pizza and drinks are very good. In particular the Bianca is great and the Margherita is nice enough to stand on its own. They also usually have a pizza that is both seasonal and vegetarian - much appreciated.",

Me and my partner sat there for a while before we got our drinks and people who sat down way after us got their entrees before we even got an appetizer. He ordered a scotch they told him they didn't have the kind he wanted so he ordered a different one. This went on several times until the server told him they just didn't have any scotch. We then decided we should not even eat here because they didn't have anything we wanted to drink. We waited an inordinate amount of time for our server to return and he didn't.     We then had to get up and tell the host we wanted to cancel our order.    Finally, when our server was sent over, he gave us attitude about canceling the order... I suppose because the host had to tell him to do his job. I said \"If you don't have what we want, why should we stay?\"  He rolled his eyes.    They finally sent the manager over after walking past our table several times, tittering about us like immature children... only so she could tell us that she was the one who placed the bar order and to apologize for her incompetence.

For dinner, I've often come for the half off specials on pizza after 9pm, which was really convenient and allowed me to sample pretty much every pizza that's on their menu.

Personally, I wasn't very impressed. The menu was a little obscure and my friends didn't see a meal they would love to eat. For an appetizer, we had calamari with spicy marinara sauce. It was good but I wasn't used to eating spicy calamari. For dinner, I had a prime sandwich with arugula and gorgonzola cheese with a side of beets. The sandwich was good but a little different. For dessert, we had the special Chocolate sponge cake. The cake was awful. I feel bad saying it was awful but it was. It was dry and had no flavor.   The restaurant is beautiful though! It's very well decorated and has a great location on Forbes Avenue and Schenley Park. If you're into obscure menu choices, give this place a try!",

I came for lunch another day and got the Beef Burger, and I highly recommend this dish. The burger patty was flavorful and huge, and it was cooked as I requested it.  My friends had each gotten a salad, and both said that they did not recommend their dishes. The Farm Bread appetizer was good for those who love bread (me). They give you a few large slices of bread with butter, fig and berry jam. As far as desserts go, I thought that their Cheesecake and Beignets were delicious.

It gets very busy for the late night pizza, along with any time the sun makes it through the clouds (~50 days a year). Overall, it's just overpriced and the food is usually either dry or unauthentic depending on what you get. The service isn't bad, but $13-14 for a small pizza is. On top of that, they have their own bee hives on top of the restaurant for homemade honey. This makes sitting outside an actual challenge and the amount of bees is sometimes frightening.",

First, I just learned that the happy hour $5 wine specials only apply if you're sitting at the bar.  Order the SAME glass of wine less than 10 feet from the bar and you will pay $9.  That's not really cool.  What is cool is the bianca pizza.  Fig pizza with goat cheese might sound weird to some, but take a bite, and you'll fall in love.  The Porch makes a light thin crust pizza that is baked to perfection.  Served with a side of Parmesan cheese and roasted red peppers while topped with arugula makes you feel like you're not breaking your diet by indulging on pizza.    The design and layout makes The Porch an a-typical restaurant smack in the middle of a college campus.  Honestly, I don't think their target market is college students - there are plenty of places that do cater to them - The Porch is a great place for faculty, college staff, graduate students, and locals.  Come here in the spring or summer and enjoy the warm breeze when they open the garage door walls to overlook Schenley Plaza with a shadow of the Cathedral of Learning casting over.",

I was a bit puzzled at the numerous poor reviews as I felt overall it was a decent place with some good dishes.  Then I went recently on a weekday during lunch. It was about the busiest I've ever seen them. Two people at my table ordered dishes that included the roasted potatoes... And they were burnt to all hell. I don't understand how the waiter could in good conscience set these plates down for us, or how any cook could let that leave the kitchen. The rest of the food was mediocre, too... Greasy pale fish sticks, very small salad portion, dried out corned beef on the Reuben. Now I understand the so-so reviews.   In summary this place can be pretty good, but obviously struggles with quality control and consistency. If friends want to go again, I'll enjoy a beer but won't expect much from the food...",

The service has got to improve on multiple factors including attitude, efficiency, and attentiveness. You can't leave a table for longer than 10 min after supplying drinks when they have yet to order apps or entrees. The waiter got increasingly more annoyed as the night went on to get refills or more drinks and we all noticed the progression. I've worked in the service industry for 10 years and if you are having a bad day, you box that up until your shift is over so that you can provide the paying patrons a comfortable and happy experience at your restaurant. And if you don't like your job, find something else you love doing more. The manager should do everything in their power to increase the morale of the staff or else I don't see this place doing any better.",

The first time I ate here was in the summer and I had breakfast food such as French toast and the works (meat, eggs, and mimosas). I told myself to come back and try out specialized items on the menu.   I was not pleased at all by the lack of selection for me to choose from. The specials of the day were just \"fancier\" versions of the selected items on the menu.  I chose the duck egg with hash and a side of farm fresh bread because I've been craving apple butter for weeks.  The hash had blue and sweet potatoes with a protein (can't recall if it was bacon or not). It could of used more seasoning.    The menu is very a la carte and if that's the vibe you're going. However, a foodie such as myself likes variety and selection that doesn't lack seasoning nor taste. The presentation of my food was good on the eye.  It came in a mini cast iron skillet. It was more visually stunning that it was worth.   I now know that for breakfast or brunch I need more selection and less flare. I want it all and with their skinny menu I can only get so much.",

I can't believe this is another part of the Eat n' Park family (although I have mad love for the E n' P, being my first job:)  It's really open, with nice dark wood, which actually also makes it feel cozy too.  I think the open fire place helped as well!  You really don't expect such a nice place to be in Oakland (sorry peeps, when I think Oakland, I think Hemingway's and dive bars).   I don't mind the help yourself kind of set up either.  You gaze over the menu of delicious looking foods.  Decide what you want, which is, in fact, pretty hard with how amazing everything sounded.  I went with the Rocket Salad.  I was sold with the word beets!  I was also sold with the amazing sounding warm spiked cider on the chalkboard.  Okay, I'll admit it, I was also sold with the taters (because I had read the reviews already, which had stated they were delish!).  So, I pigged out.  Well worth it my friends!  The salad was really amazing.  It was a great spring mix of lettuce, a good amount of beets and a light sherry vinaigrette dressing.  I thought there was a little too many croutons and Chorizo.  But I loved the parmesan and sunflower seeds.  Overall, a win.  I also enjoyed the taters.  For some reason I thought they were going to be more like tots, but they ended up being more like homefries.  Now, if you like crispy homefries, you'll LOVE this!  There's tons of crispy little potato pieces amongst large chunks of taters.  I LOVE me some crispy taters, so this was totally fine with me!  I wasn't too into the curry ketchup, but I'm a 100% Heinz devotee, so this isn't surprising if you know me.  But they gladly brought me regular ketchup (I believe Heinz:).    Speaking of service....I thought it was awesome!  I feel like when there's a help yourself service, you expect to be ignored most of the time.  But I think there was at least 4 or 5 people that came around to ask if we needed anything, cleared our plates and checked on us again, that it was incredibly impressive!  You will not be ignored!    Oh, and my spiked cider, absolutely satisfying on a crisp winter day!  I loved the taste, the whipped cream and cute little cinnamon stick accent.  Love love love everything!  Can't wait to return!",

Maybe we got lucky, maybe they're turning their act around, or maybe a lot of the negative reviews come from college students - not trying to get myself in trouble here - who are overly critical of, well everything.   We were down from NYC for a wedding in the area and stumbled across The Porch on a Sat around noon.  Being a New Yorker - again not trying to get myself in trouble - we are very fortunate to have a plethora of options for pretty much everything you can desire. Porch succeeded in many ways that many New York establishments do not... We were sat right away, greeted with water, coffee and a drink menu. Our server answered all of our questions and provided with quick and attentive service. Our group ordered: egg sandwiches, smoked salmon, pizza and eggs benny. Everything we had was fresh and flavorful and inexpensive.  Look this is not a five star establishment. It is not fine dining. It IS on campus and gets a young crowd along with families. I would consider them a high volume place, and with that in mind they handle their business well.   Next time I'm back in the Oakland area I'll eat at Porch again.",

The cheeses were all tasty and I was a huge fan of the fig jam included on the platter. The mushroom pizza had some of the freshest mushrooms I've had on a pizza.

They are crispy, easy to eat and come with a set of different sauces so it's not messy.   2. Love the pizza but have to watch for the spices they include next to the pie, if badly applied, they can ruin the whole pizza!  3. Very good lasagna, not full of cheese, you get to enjoy all the ingredients.  We haven't found any food we didn't like and the staff is very friendly and are always checking on you (dinner)   Will return many times while we are still in Pittsburgh, such a great option and so close to Carnegie Mellon University!",

A few issues I had with Porch:  1.  The service was kind of all over the place.  We came in around 4:00, which was when the kitchen was switching from lunch to dinner.  We had to ask our waitress three times before we finally understand what was and what was not available.  We ended up ordering an appetizer and waiting until 4:30 when we could order dinner.   2.  Two employees were cleaning off a table and loudly complaining about another employee and just generally being unprofessional.   2.  My friend ordered the Pineapple Sage Margarita and had to send it back.  It tasted like mostly some sort of sour mix and little to no alcohol.  It was seriously undrinkable (and for me to say that takes a lot). 3.  The side salad was JUST GREENS.  I cannot stand when restaurants do this.  Industry I'm looking at you here.  CUT UP A CARROT AND THROW IT ON THE GREENS.  Or anything!  sprinkle some gorgonzola on it, toss on some almonds, cut up an apple, for the love of god do NOT just open up a bag of greens and plop some in a bowl.  Even a fancy bowl.  It will make me insane.    They had Big Hop on tap, so I was pleased with that.    All in all a good experience, but I wouldn't confidently being people back.",

The pint of Night of the Living Stout (from nearby Full Pint Brewing Company) was much more distinctive.   I had the burger and the caesar salad, both of which were excellent.

I have never left totally disgusted, but I don't think it's very good and would like to give it 2.5 stars (come on Yelp, break out the half stars already!). The decor is very open, trendy, bright and inviting and the food presentation is above average. The actual taste is average and I feel that the prices are higher than they should be for what they're offering. Maybe I've just had bad luck, but everything I've had to eat there is either extremely bland or over-seasoned to the point that I can't even eat it (I'm talking about you, brunch potatoes). Service is generally friendly, but clueless. For example, I sat down in a soaking wet booth on my most recent visit and mentioned it to the hostess who was seating us and she just stared at me and looked alarmed while I wiped it up with my napkin. I also had to remind my server to ask me how I wanted my burger cooked and was told that I was getting strips of bacon but had pork belly delivered to the table. He kept a smile plastered on his face, but doing everyone's job when I'm a patron can get exhausting! My aunt loves the pizza at the Porch, but my boyfriend and I didn't like it at all. I get the impression that you either love The Porch and rave about it or don't like it. I'm in the latter group.

So whether you want to grab a quick bite or sit down with a date or some friends, this is a nice place to try out.   Bonus: THe fireplace outside provides a really nice environment. They  also have two garage type doors that open up to the outside and include an outside bar with tvs. I can't wait to use it when it's warm out.",

It reminded me of mini fried potato dumplings; I never had potatoes prepared this way and it was excellent. I ordered the Arugula salad and my daughter ordered the Margarita pizza. Both meals were great. Excellent service, very nice, informal environment. I will definitely come again.",

If I was rating on brunch alone, easily 5 stars.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by lunch and even more so by dinner, hence only 3 stars.   If you are looking for a brunch spot with wonderful outside dining where you are not haveing to suck car exhaust fumes, give Porch a shot. I think the outdoor dining may be the best in the city.",

    "text": "This place has a good amount of reviews so I won't say much. I got a hamburger (somewhat against my better judgement due to all the great stuff on the menu) and asked for medium-rare. What I got was almost revoltingly rare. It had a delicious crust to it so I know it saw some time on the grill, but the center was almost cold (and by the time I finished it was decidedly cold). I like some red to my meat, but there were parts of it that were absurdly raw and not at all pleasant. I've had problems getting medium-rare in Pittsburgh (including Brgr and Burgatory who seem to only do well-done) but this chef seems to under-cook. I pointed it out to my waitress (although I did not send it back because it was really really delicious) and she said they had received similar complaints before. In fact, they guy behind me was complaining to his wife that his came out medium instead of well-done.  I'm sure they use good beef and have high safety standards but I genuinely felt like I might get sick from the burger when I was eating it (this did not happen). To drive the point home: IT IS LIKELY THEY WILL UNDER-COOK YOUR BURGER. I don't want to come off as libelous, but from my experience, the guy next to me, and the waitress, this is something that happens with some regularity.  That said, the burger was outstanding. The toppings were delicious, the bun was grilled for crust, the salad on the side was a great, slightly bitter accompaniment that was perfectly dressed, and their mixed pickle was sooo good. It was a very well-balanced meal; each flavor complemented each other well and each element was well-made. Maybe I'm being harsh with the 3 stars (especially since I could've taken it back), but when you charge the prices they do, a diner should not have to worry about something so amateur as under-cooked meat. If you like rare burgers or order something else, this place is probably great.",

Chef Kevin's filet mignon with grape mustard reduction is a hit every time I try it (four times so far).  The pizza has bubbly crust (I'm recently back from a trip to Napoli and have been working to reproduce it myself).   I don't understand the complaints about the service.  It has been off a couple of times when special local events overwhelmed the place (they still tried their best), but usually it is superb.  The idea here is artisan smoked meat which they produce on their own smoker on (you guessed it) the porch.  The filet mignon has their home-smoked bacon around it.  That's really cool!  I am at CMU and have to entertain visitors someplace.  Before the Porch opened it was a nightmare, but now it is easy and my out of town guests are always very pleased!",

Our waitress was very knowledgable and helpful in describing the menu items we were considering.  We decided to share one of their Rocket salads and one of their Margarita pizzas.  We had a reasonably priced bottle of tasty Sangiovese wine.  The salad was very good, with shaved cheese, slices of chorizo and other goodies and plenty to share.  Likewise, the pizza was also very good, and provided enough to eat that we had no room for dessert.  We especially liked that the pizza, which was served on a cookie sheet, was accompanied by three small piles of toppings - finely grated cheese, dried red pepper flakes, and oregano.  We enjoyed adding a pinch of each to our pizza slices.  Their pizza crust is quite thin (our preference).  We both thought that there was something a bit too salty about the pizza, and after further review, we concluded that the saltiness was in the crust.  We each had a double espresso before leaving.  We will return, and probably often given their close proximity to the Carnegie and Phipps.  When we left, we went outside and checked out their outdoor fireplace and patio area, and concluded that would be a wonderful spot to dine in warmer weather.",

The girl just kept making excuses about how no one told her about the reservation and suggested if we want to stand up off to the side and eat our food there. CMON, really? just chill off to the side and eat while standing for a birthday dinner? Who even thinks of these kinds of things? We finally got seated a quarter after 10, and the food wasn't even worth our wait. They recently changed their pizza menu, and got rid of the BBQ pizza. I ordered 3 different pizzas to share with a friend, and only one was worth paying for. Marguerita pizza was good, bacon&eggs and genovese were not. They were so salty and the bacon&eggs had only one egg on it. Also, the egg yolk was hard, not runny, like the pizzas I saw on other people's plates. So conclusion is, I probably wouldn't go here for weekday late nights anymore, and the new menu sucks. Not to mention their service. I thought they would at least bring us a free pitcher of juice or something for making us wait an hour and a half after making a reservation. But nope.",

We grab a table and then 20 minutes later I get up and ask for a menu (since no one acknowledged us at all). They give us menus and then 20 minutes later, after no one came to take our order, I got up and asked the bartender if I could just tell him our order. He said (rudely) that he would get to us and has a lot of other tables. I was so pissed that he was so rude and annoyed because it was a birthday and I wanted to do a special dinner!  We ended up leaving because they ignored us for so long. At this point it was too late in the evening to go somewhere else so we ended up letting the kids have waffles and ice cream for dinner (which they were ultimately thrilled about and probably saved us $50). But I was so upset because it was supposed to be their birthday dinner and I couldn't believe what a jerk that guy was to us! I felt like he was extra rude because we had children, when it is adjacent to a park, of course there are going to be kids!",

Comfort food and really innovative mixing of ingredients.  Always fresh and delivered piping hot to your table.  Their food sourcing must be excellent because the vegetables, meat, etc. are delicious.  For the price you can't beat it -- its one of the top 10 restaurants in Pittsburgh but for half the price of Habitat at the Fairmont or Toast.  We have had a great waitress named Tara who is a Pitt student and just delightful.  My one small bit of constructive criticism is that their deserts are super heavy and completely fattening -- some cobblers or something kind of healthy would be nice.",

And maybe they could be better if they weren't using the exact same products as their parent restaurant Eat n Park.  I ordered the specialty pizza of the day (butternut squash) and was completely underwhelmed. The  dough was the same that EnP uses for their rolls, the sauce was the same that is used for EnP's spaghetti sauce and the cheese was as bland as you could get. Had there been a little bit more thought into the ingredients like higher quality cheese (feta, maybe) and sauce that didn't come from a can it could've worked.  Unfortunately, they thought they could give you great ambiance and new presentation and you wouldn't notice that you just had diner food. The most offensive part was the $10 that I paid for a pizza that was less impressive (and substantially smaller)  than a $5 take out pizza that I could've gotten around the corner.",

I did like the utensils wrapped in dish towels...it's economical and beats paper napkins.  I had the special, crispy soft shelled crabs  with pearl couscous and a surprise of fiddlehead ferns and artichoke hearts tucked underneath.   My Caesar salad was on spot. My partner ordered the half chicken roasted  with roasted  vegetables. He reported the chicken moist and flavorful however the potatoes were too heavy on clove for his liking.   To finish our meal I chose the crispy doughnuts with rhubarb sauce..delightful. My partner selected the lemon cake which he enjoyed.

Why and how did they get to build in the middle of a a fake park that took over a parking lot with the goal of returning the Plaza to it original use at the time of Mary Schenley. After eating this pizza I decided to leave my protest behind and congratulate Eat and Park for making a cool space and serving good food.  I think even Mary Schenley would like this pie. WE had a soup that was a weird corn chowder but it tasted really good- they gave us a taste and we liked it enough to order a bowl.  The cesaer salad was huge and very good.   They feature fresh local ingridients.  We had the \" never order again\" cookies platter for dessert and they were too think, too soft and tasted like a too bad use of butter and sugar- the gellato was very good, they served it in three scopes including hazelnut, vanilla and chocolate and I liked the Hazelnut the best.  Water is served in mason jars, serving staff is very nice and well trained.  pace is new and has a southern feel-large garage doors open air and their are outdoor tables.",

    "text": "I try to avoid Oakland whenever possible due to the traffic and the lack of parking, but I biked down to the Porch today for brunch and I am so glad I did! The venue is great with both indoor and outdoor seating. We took advantage of the outdoor space since we won't have many more options to do that before the weather changes. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about all of the dishes, and it seems like they use a lot of local ingredients.  The menu is not extensive but there are so many appealing options! I was so torn in my decision I had to have someone else make it for me, and I ended up with quiche of the day, which was made with olive tapenade and feta. DELICIOUS. Not only was the quiche great (and different from any other quiche I've had), but the crispy were fantastic. They are nice and soft with just a little crunch to them, and they were flavored with a hint of rosemary. They are served with curry ketchup, which is different - and not in a bad way. It has a bit of a zing to it and is unlike anything I've tried before. I felt like it was a little early to be eating curry, but I got over that pretty quickly. I didn't try the pizza but it looked and smelled amazing. I also got a whiff of the pork belly from a nearby table, and will need to put that on the list to try as well.  Oh! And did I mention the pitchers of mimosas? (They also have pitchers of sangria and margaritas, but it was a little too early for tequila or wine after a long Saturday night.)",

Luckily I had just grabbed the City Paper's Dining Guide and I realized there are a lot of places in the city I haven't been yet - although it feels like I've been to all of them! We had a place picked out, but because the weather was so beautiful yesterday, we decided to switch gears and find a place where we could sit outside and enjoy the nice evening.  I found The Porch at Schenley and it was a perfect spot! I can't believe I hadn't been here yet!! We sat out on 'the porch' and the atmosphere was great - people everywhere - and you were able to people watch in Schenley Plaza. It's such a great laid back place.   The food was also amazing. I had an Almost Arnie - which was limoncello, iced tea and mint. It was so good and refreshing - not too heavy. We ordered the rustic bread salad which was deelish - a free iron skillet corn bread that I received a coupon for in my email - and that was amazing, and then I had the Garden Vegetable burger. It was served with a side of potatoes. Everything was above average for sure. I can't wait to go back! It would be a great place for just drinks and appetizers too!",

    "text": "I'll have to agree with others when I say I gave this place 2 stars ONLY because of the location/atmosphere. Being from Florida I love any opportunity I get to sit outside in shade and eat/drink.  Our waitress was attentive and very nice. That is about the last nice thing I have to say about this place.  We happened to walk past The Porch on a Sunday Funday in Oakland and decided to try it out. My boyfriend ordered a mimosa. Mimosas are incredibly simple drinks. Pretty sure what they served him was a glass of just orange juice, though the waitress insisted it was a mimosa. They also served it in a regular glass instead of a champagne flute. Why bother to offer it?  We ordered a margherita pizza to split. It was brought out on a baking pan with piles of red pepper flakes and extra cheese on the side (not in separate containers), which is ridiculously gross. If I was splitting this with friends I wouldn't want everyone dipping their fingers into it. We didn't have spoons so we figured that is what we were supposed to do, though we stopped the waitress and got spoons because that's just gross.  The pizza was probably the second worst margherita pizza I've had in Pittsburgh (Fuel & Fuddle gave me the worst). In fact, to call it a margherita pizza would be an insult to actual margherita pizza. It was more like a cheese pizza - where was the basil? Then I found out it's owned and operated by Eat N' Park. That explains everything.  I also agree that the pricing seems wack for the neighborhood that it is in. We definitely will not be back. Even with their great happy hour it's not worth it.",

    "text": "Note: this review is about The Porch's happy hour.  The Porch has an ongoing happy hour special weekdays 4:30-6:30pm with $3 draft beer and $5 glasses of wine. This is a good deal. The rating isn't reflecting on the deal itself, but rather how the restaurant manages to spoil it with an obscure policy about where you have to be in the restaurant in order to take advantage of it. Basically, you need to be standing at the bar. If you're at a table you don't get the happy hour special.   This is unfortunate because if you come in with a group of people at that time of day, chances are you want to get yourselves set up in a comfy booth and enjoy the late afternoon over a few drinks and, probably, a tasty pizza. I've been in on a number of occasions and suffered at the hands of this peculiarly particular Porch policy. I have sometimes taken issue with my server and had my issue raised with the manager. One time the manager decided to give happy hour drink prices to my table. Every other time the manager was less cooperative.  I'm a stickler for service and expect high standards--even in casual places like The Porch. What bothers me the most is when policies don't make sense. Unfortunately, this is one of those times.  Will I be back to The Porch? Of course--I work down the street and this is the best bet for lunch or a casual dinner on the Pitt campus. Do I like this weird happy hour policy? No, but what can one do? Other than sit at the bar, I suppose...",

The chorizo is the highlight of this dish and it was amazing. I LOVED the crispy potatoes with the curry ketchup. Such a fantastic combination. They also offer Mimosas and Bloody Marys, not listed on the menu, but they are available. The Bloody Mary was loaded with horseradish (which I LOVE) but the tomato juice tasted really watery. I was a little bummed out by that but not enough to put a damper on our brunch. We will definitely return and I loved that we didn't wait a bit for a table at 11:30 on a Sunday. It was awesome. Parking can be difficult, but it's Oakland, what do you expect?",

I've received a grossly undercooked burger and my mother recieved a stale quiche the last time I went. I was also treated very rudely by the waiters on at least 3 occasions.  This restaurant attempts to serve \"fancy\" food and charges through the nose, but DOES NOT DELIVER. Do not waste your time here, and go to literally any other restaurant in Pittsburgh.

    "text": "Like Tom Cruise in the '80s, this place has all the right moves. I really look forward to eating here whenever I get a chance.  The menu isn't huge, but everything I've had is made perfectly. It's the kind of food I categorize as simply delicious: you can taste ingredients, it doesn't feel over done or over wrought. Very easy to enjoy.  There are plenty of tasty items for vegetarians, from hand made pizzas and salad to soups and grilled cheese. I typically get  a grilled cheese and whatever their vegetarian soup of the day is, and the only disappointment is when I've reached the bottom of the bowl.   Since the restaurant space has both booths and tables, I imagine it can accommodate a larger group, though I always recommend calling a restaurant ahead to ask their advice, if that's what you're planning. If you're on a work lunch, expect an ok turn around on getting the food on your table, but I'm not sure you can do it if you are on a 30 minute break. I recall it takes at least 45 minutes from order to finishing your meal.  The Porch has a really comfortable, modern space that is welcoming. Wide windows let bright light into the expansive dining room. It's a detail so small, but I love the cloth napkins that they use that look like a smaller version of a kitchen tea towel. You'll order at a counter when you come in and seat yourself, but don't fret: there are servers/busers that peruse the dining area to bring out your food, refill waters, and attend to anything else you might need. They have been very friendly in my experience. I'm so looking forward to spending some time on Porch's porch when the warmer months hit. I expect it to be lovely to hang around Schenley Plaza with a refreshing drink, excellent food, and good company.",

Even McDonalds would not have messed this up on a busy night, or any fast-food place that honestly has much better quality food. I was waiting for over an hour for a 15 dollar pizza, where the waiter ended up giving my order to someone at another table. I had to flag them down four times to get a simple re-fill. They are not competent enough to realize that their own customers have not received food. Obviously, one who is applying to work at this place must be incompetent and straight up unaware. Also, it may be a preference for applicants to have a rude personality. I am sure it is not always like this, but a lot of the time it is. This place rarely gets busy, making it ideal for reserving large parties.",

However, I enjoyed the event so much that I came back with a friend just two days later.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic. Not only is the patio - or should I say, the porch - of the restaurant great but so is the interior. It feels very modern and relaxed at the same time.  I ordered the Bianca Pizza, a delicious concoction made with fig jam, goat cheese, arugula, and black truffle oil. Since pizza often requires a beer, I ordered my favorite beer of all time (that they have on tap) which is Full Pint White Lightning. My friend had already eaten and just ordered three flavors of gelato - vanilla, chocolate, and hazelnut. She said the flavor of the vanilla was just out of this world.  If you're ever looking for a beautiful and laid back place to enjoy a delicious meal made with local ingredients, this is the place for you. I'm already dreaming of coming back again.",

Our table ordered the piggy pizza and the bbq pizza.  The BBQ was better than the piggy. The piggy one was super salty. Overall, pretty disappointing experience. We will not be back.",

I ordered the special of the morning which was a hash of sorts with chorizo, potatoes and eggs. I ordered my eggs over easy but they definitely were sunny side up. I asked the waitress about it and she was a little argumentative as to what an over easy egg was. She did offer to take it back but I told her it was ok. One of the other guests did have their eggs sent back and ended up having eggs over hard. The hash itself was pretty bad. I love chorizo but there was far too much and they were just huge chunks throughout the dish that made it not feel cohesive. The food was also pretty costly and not worth it.",

The bread was over toasted to the point it hurt the top of my mouth while chewing, the filling was ok, and tater tots were awful.   They need to revamp menu, add more veg options and improve their service.",

    "text": "This is going to be one of those reviews that will make some people cringe and others go, eh oh well. I really wish that I could give 0 stars just because today I was just that disgusted. Background, I work in a health care profession and I am going to school for Social Work (this will play into the review).  The Porch at Schenley offers a happy hour special that is only for the bar area. Ok, that is fine. You have an entire restaurant but you choose to only allow this special to occur at one area.   I approached the manager Tia to talk to her about this issue. I said, \"Hey we have been here for a bit and would like the special but there are no areas by the bar for us to take up and we were seated at a booth. Could the happy hour be extended to us?\" She said she would talk to the GM Mike and when she came back he said no.   This is when my Social Worker hat came out and was put on. I asked where in the bar area was the ADA compliant section? Or even a section for those people who could not sit on those types of chairs without medical consequences? Maybe I couldn't sit in those taller chairs with no padding because of something medical.... But really this response thinks about those with disability that are not visible and might not be able to sit on no backed stools, or other issues have no place for them to enjoy happy hour. Is there no place that would accommodate those who might not want their disability known? Tia was wonderful, she thought about that for a second and was like, \"that is a great comment and no, I haven't thought about that, let me ask Mike.\" At this point in the story Mike will be known as something that might get me flagged so just change his name in your mind. Mike said, \"if that is the case I need to know about the disability and we will pull a table into the bar area.\"  So Mike, what you are telling me is that you want someone to tell you that they have a disability, or a medical issue, and then in front of a crowded restaurant you will PULL A TABLE OVER TO THE BAR AREA instead of just allowing someone to hold a booth? Really? REALLY??? So basically, lets out those with issues just so we can get that $5 glass of wine? And if anyone has seen the bar area at the Porch there is no way a table could be dragged over and fit there for 4 people.   While this was an enlightening experience I did not let it ruin the night. We ate a full meal, including dessert. But I will really think hard about coming here again. I just hope maybe my question for the night will make the managers and general managers think hard about those who might not be able to partake in their bar area.",

Many places tend to pile on the corned beef and I have to remove much of it before eating, but this one had a perfect ratio of meat, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and their house made sauerkraut.   My mom loved her Garden Harvest salad with field greens, roasted green beans, roasted beets, goat cheese, walnuts, mushrooms, and drizzled with a tarragon vinaigrette.   It was the perfect place to stop for a light, refreshingly lunch between visiting Pitt State and The Carnegie Museum of Natural History. I felt that the prices were very reasonable for the quality and freshness of the food presented. The restaurant was beautiful inside and out (and I love that they have a rooftop garden!)",

I had a  jalapeno Bloody Mary with my brunch. It was pretty spicy, but I like a little more olive juice in my marys.   The food was good. I tried their special of the day (Denver omelette), and my boyfriend had their breakfast sandwich. I tried his sandwich (which was better than the omelette). The taters are also very good.

    "text": "I'm going to make this short and sweet. The food is good.   Okay, I'll elaborate just a bit more... When I drove by this place for the first time, I almost missed it and once I saw it I almost headed somewhere else. My fellow Yelpers have never let me down so I braved the bitter cold and went in with my lil boo.   I walked in and found it to be sorta trendy and cozy. We were greeted immediately then led to our table. It was a little dark but I think it added to the ambience this place was trying to give off. Surprisingly, unlike it's Big mama, Eat n Park, the menu here is one small sheet of heavy stock card.  I like when restaurants throw a few selections out there in the hopes that they are focusing on perfectly executing each dish. Here, that's exactly what I observed.    I was caught between a rock and a hard place...a burger or prime rib? All I knew was I wanted BEEF! After reading that they put short ribs on top of their burger and those crispy fried onions, I figured this would be a winner and boy, it did not disappoint. The burger itself was so tender and juicy, so much so it just melted on my tongue. I will venture to say that it's the best darn burger I've had to date, so so good! They serve it with sea salt sprinkled mini potatoes and tomato jam. It would be a sin to call it ketchup because it just isn't. It's tomato jam, darnit! It had a sweet, yet tart, and tad bit of spiciness to it that just made me continually keep on dipping until I ran out of potatoes. Yum....  We also ordered smoked wings that came with blue cheese dressing, buffalo and bbq sauces. Make no mistake...these were not your normal run of the mill bottled sauces/dressings. Each one hit the tongue and made us say, \"Wow\".  The wings were crispy and were so smoky with the perfect amount of salt.  Really, no other seasoning was needed...they tasted like bacon. You know bacon is always a good thing.  We ordered the bread pudding for dessert but were very disappointed in the overall flavor. There was too much banana and very little sugar which is the point of dessert, right? It wasn't a huge deal though as the waiter removed it from our table and our bill. Service, by the way, was very good!   There are a few other items I'd like to sample here in the future like the veggie burger and the prime rib, one day. For now, I'm going to spread the word about the juiciest burger in Oakland.",

    "text": "Guys, the Porch has so much potential but falls short of being a top notch restaurant.  The good:  The food- This restaurant has an incredibly creative menu made with quality ingredients. I ordered the Porch Burger which consisted of a patty, ribs, cheese, shallots, and a type of tomato jam. At first when I ordered it, I was a little skeptical about the ingredients since the pairing seemed so random, but they ended up mixing beautifully! I ordered the burger medium and it was cooked with the perfect amount of pink in it too. Additionally the tots that came with the burger was just as delicious and were made with the perfect combination of spices with a really yummy tomato-y dip. The draft and bottle list is also pretty good but you need to ask the waiter for the full list since only a partial list is at the table.  The bad:  The service- inexcusably slow. It took someone ten minutes to get us waters and get our drinks in.  And another waiter ended up getting our beer orders in since no one came to wait us on drinks. Additionally, the restaurant wasn't very full either. Throughout the rest of our visit, it just took longer than needed to get our food, our check, etc.  The prices- a little expensive in my opinion. While the food was fantastic, I think $15 for a burger was a little much.   Overall, while the service is lacking and it's a little pricey, you should still visit the Porch for the fantastic and innovative food. You will definitely leave with a satisfying food coma!",

It was full of fruit and not bitter at all.  We shared the hummus with pickled veggies(beets,pickles,onions and cauliflower).  The hummus was delicious and not too garlicky.  The pickle added a great crunch.  The star was the pita which was charred and probably housemade.  It was seasoned with curry and sesame seeds...soft and fluffy I would have been happy with this as my meal.  I ordered the Bianca pizza as my meal which was very tasty with fig jam, arugula and goat cheese but the crust was no where near as good as the pita.  The pizza is is pretty large so would be a great appetizer or a meal to share.  My other dinner mates got the filet with potatoes o gratin and asparagus which was the feature meal tonight.  They both liked their meals but didn't rave about them.  I will definitely be back to try some other things that caught my eye.  I'm always happy to eat someplace that serves fresh wholesome food.  Definitely give this a try if you haven't already.",

We went at least twice a month for almost two full years.   Although I like The Porch, my one big complaint is the alcoholic beverages they serve. Like, WHY CANT I TASTE ANY ALCOHOL IN THE COCKTAILS? I've had pitchers as well as glasses of sangria, margaritas, their lemonade and their Arnold Palmer type cocktail, and I feel like I've probably had some kind of well drink as well. One time we purchased a pitcher and then asked how much it would cost to add an additional shot and was told one shot would be $8.00. EIGHT DOLLARS. I'm not trying to get sloshed, but come on. I know it's practically on a college campus and there are a bunch of college kids would *might* drink too much, but I just want a proper cocktail. If I wanted no alcohol, I would have just had water.  Now onto the reasons I still visit The Porch: -During the week they have half off pizzas after 9pm -Their desserts are awesome. I've had way too many donuts and gelato to even truthfully explain on yelp. -A lot of the apps, especially the pretzels. -The location.",

I ordered the Oven Baked Cheese Bread and it was delicious. The bottom of the bread had a crispy layer, which was a perfect balance for the softer top covered in cheese. Served with sides of ranch and marinara sauce, both were good complements to the bread flavor. I would have liked more marinara sauce though, I ran out after a few slices of bread.   Pizza is half price from Monday-Thursday, which we didn't realize until our checks arrived. I would have liked to know this prior to ordering, because my cheese bread ended up costing more than getting a whole pizza. Their beer prices are also a bit high (I got a canned cider for $7). Location of this restaurant is great for if you are in Oakland, Schenley Park, or a Pitt student. I can see my team coming back here in the future.",

Our waiter was very talkative and provided tons of tips and suggestions about our meal. Very personable.   The vibe is casual and relaxed. Heavy, wooden furniture. Spacious restaurant area. Glass walls, providing tons of natural light, which is a nice touch. Large groups can be accommodated.   Calamari ($9) were exceptional. I'm not crazy about calamari, as they're over rated and served everywhere with no differentiating points. But these were the best calamari I've ever tried, no exaggeration. Very lightly breaded, which was a huge plus, as the breading crumbled easily, revealing perfectly tender, fresh calamari. Light and flavorful. Well-seasoned marinara sauce. Do recommend!  Bianca pizza ($13) topped with arugula, savory Fig Jam, goat cheese, & Black Truffle Oil, was very fragrant. The truffle aromas were bewitching even after the pie cooled down. Filling size portion to share for two people or take home leftovers if ordered as an entree for one person. All pizzas are cooked in flat stone ovens and served on a metal tray.   The star of the night was undoubtedly the Scottish Salmon ($23). Served with Soft Cornbread Pudding, Foraged Mushroom Relish, Green Beans, and Beurre Blanc, the portion was more than filling. It was so incredibly delicious that I had to finish it all, stuffing myself to happy oblivion. It was a perfect medley of incredible ingredients and flavors. I felt like eating this forever--just so incredibly satisfying. A must try! The salmon was perfectly cooked--gentle fillet flakes were falling apart upon contact. The crispy skin was a treat of its own--so crunchy and well-seasoned. The mushrooms were a perfect addition, mixed with green beans and beurre blanc, creating a heavenly explosion of savory, salty, sour and sweet. The cornbread was on point. Still raving about this dish--it was perfection personified.  Definitely recommend to treat yourself to this experience!",

Unfortunately the food is where The Porch falls a little flat:  Omelette of the Day (3/5): it was a very basic omelette, the crispy potatoes were delicious though.  Sunny Side Burger (3/5): just your average burger, it is pretty filling and heavy.  Eggs Benedict  (3/5): if you like a lot of spice-y flavor, then I would recommend it. However I didn't think it was a great flavor for a benedict.  The service was just okay, the waiter didn't seem very enthusiastic to serve us. Overall just an average brunch restaurant.",

We ordered the Crispy Taters, Fried Cauliflower, and the Bianca Pizza. The Crispy Taters were interesting because of the curried ketchup - it wasn't too heavily spiced, but it did have a subtle aftertaste of curry. I didn't care too much for the Fried Cauliflower - the sauce was a bit strange and the cauliflower was just okay. The Bianca Pizza was great - I'm personally a fan of truffle oil, so if you like the taste/smell of it, this is your type of pizza!   Overall, great food for a great price, especially on the pizzas at night!",

It's a good place for a date, a group of friends to catch up, or grabbing a drink with a friend. THEY DON'T TAKE RESERVATIONS so if you are trying to go there with a big party there is an app you can use to reserve a table like 30 minutes before you get there. Also I think you can just call ahead, but only like 30 minutes ahead. I think.",

It was lunchtime on a Saturday and pretty crowded.  We were told our wait was 10-15 minutes which wasn't bad. There's a small counter if you don't want a table which was nice.   The restaurant is a lot bigger inside than it looks outside.. plenty of seating.  We were seated in about 10 minutes.  The menu (brunch) was small - but don't feel it was limited.. it was just right.  There was something on there for everyone - especially my picky boyfriend.  I ordered the chicken blt with side of crispy taters and a margarita pizza for us to share.   The pizza came first and I really love how it was served. .on a oven square pan with cheese, red pepper flakes and oregano (think it was that spice).  What a clever way of serving this delicious pizza.   Ok -now this pizza was pretty delicious.. one of the best I have had and disappeared quickly.. everyone at my table agreed.   The chicken blt sandwich was perfect (so fresh!) and accompanied by \"crispy taters\" which were interesting.. little chucks of potatoes cooked until golden brown - were quite good.    Despite the restaurant was quite busy our service was excellent. I look forward to returning and sitting outside.  Definitely a great first experience. Thanks to \"the porch\".",

The first time I went was as a freshman and I was thoroughly impressed when I ordered the Bianca pizza.  The somewhat unique combination of fig sauce topped with arugula was surprisingly delicious and exceeded my expectations. I went with a large party and they were very accommodating.   However, the second time I went with my significant other as a sophomore, I decided to order a \"prime rib\" sandwich and an apple based dessert. The prime rib sandwich was very disappointing with over cooked and dried beef and the dessert was simply awful. It looked like an attempt at the cobbler but ended up tasting like crumbs and dough tossed lazily on apples.  Oddly, enough I went back as junior with a couple of friends and had a very mixed experience. I personally ordered the prime rib and was completely satisfied with how it was cooked and it tasted delicious. However, my roommate ordered the seafood hot pot and was left disappointed with the portion size. Luckily, the staff was very accommodating and was able to give my roommate a replacement dish that was very filling. The wait was a bit long overall though.   Overall, the porch is located in a convenient place, but the quality of their food items really does vary from dish to dish.",

It was my dad's first time there and he kept asking if the service is usually this bad. It seemed they were underprepared for the weekend rush. I felt really bad that ended up being the \"main event\" of the night, rather than the show.  With that being said, I've never had food that wasn't good here! The pizzas are great and there's so unique options as well. My dad got a pizza with crab on it which was wonderful! I opted for the margherita pizza which is tasty as well! This was also the first time I had a bad experience here with service. The waitress was delightful but we could tell she was stressed and overwhelmed, despite working there several years, she said. I might also add, parking usually is not good. There's limited on-street parking but it's usually filled up. I hope this unique dining spot is able to turn things around!",

My friends all decided to order the ($14) Eggs Benedict while I stuck with their ($5) Cinnamon rolls. The food came after maybe 10-15 minutes. The portions were quite sizable, even for the cinnamon rolls.   Seeing that I ordered them, I can speak best about the rolls. They were presented in a cast iron pan and coated in cream cheese icing. They were very soft and at a nice temperature, but the edges also had a good crunch to them. They weren't overpoweringly sweet. Although I couldn't finish them, I did enjoy having them! I think they were very much worth their price and I'm glad I chose to try them. I would order them again if I were in the mood for some sugar.  I tried my friends' eggs benedict. This time they seemed to have chorizo as the meat. The bread underneath was still crunch and the salt of the chorizo complimented the flavor of the egg and bread well. The tater tots are just small potatoes on the side. It also tastes really good with the ketchup they give!   Overall I'm always satisfied after leaving the porch. It has a nice ambiance, an aesthetic inside and affordable prices for college students or those not looking to spend a fortune on food! I'm always down to come back!",

    "text": "Ok I know what people are going to say: How could you give The Porch only 3 stars!  Went here for brunch today and the meal had two sides the really good and the bad.   What we sampled:   Farm Bread with honey butter, apple butter, and blueberry preserves            Today's farm bread was homemade english muffins and the order came with 2 whole english muffins.  The muffins were delicious especially enhanced with the different butters and preserves.   Bianca Pizza: Fig Jam, Goat Cheese, Mozzarella, Arugula, Truffle oil             This was my order, and I was pretty disappointed. I love all of the things that this pizza promised, but I don't think that it delivered. Overall the pizza had way to much fig jam and the taste was overwhelming and I wasn't able to taste the other flavors.   Burger: Roasted Red Peppers, Caramelizied Onions, and a Fried Egg on a Brioche Bun              This burger was awesome!  The burger was cooked rare though we requested medium rare, but it was so good it didn't matter.  Also the egg was perfectly cooked.  This was messy and delicious in all the right ways.   Cast iron pork belly              Possibly the most disappointing dish of all.  It was a small cast iron skillet with 10 small chunks of pork belly that were so overcooked they were almost impossible to eat.   I would probably return for dinner to see what they are able to do, but I don't know about brunch.   The service was good and our waitress fulfilled every request that we had. The place was bustling with small and large groups and the noise level was moderate.  I also liked the decor and the towels for napkins.",

My favorite is the BBQ pizza because it's hearty and a perfect balance between sweet and spicy.  The margarita pizza is also amazing and one of the best margarita pizzas I've ever had.  One complaint is that the pizza sizes are inconsistent depending on the day and who is working.  Last month a bunch of friends and I went and all the pizzas were burnt but I just went last week and they were cooked perfectly.",

Living in South Oakland makes me forget what fine dining feels like, while The Porch isn't exactly fine dining, it is a pretty place to go on a date or bring your family from out of town. It is in an awesome location with the Cathedral of Learning right across the street and Schenley plaza to one side. I love this place and can't wait to go again.",

    "text": "We went to The Porch this past Saturday and the food was delicious. My wife had never been to The Porch before so the waitress was explaining that the food was mainly organic or natural food with the exception to their water. She said the water is not organic but it is locally sourced and 100% guaranteed to contain water molecules previously drank by Julius Caesar. Which sounds awesome; unless you grew up in the British education system. Which is why my wife asked me if Julius Caesar was a famous US President. We started off with the cast iron cornbread and scallops. Both tasted good. We especially liked the honey butter with the cornbread. The scallops came with risotto and some type of nut in a spicy red sauce. I couldn't quite determine what was in the red sauce, but it tasted so good. For the entrees, we had the Filet Mignon and Salmon. The filet was wrapped in bacon and perfectly cooked. I personally don't like broccoli rabe. I don't know why people like broccoli rabe so much. I always feel like I am getting cheated out of the good broccoli parts. I also didn't like the Violet Mustard sauce under the filet that much. I would really like to try a blue cheese sauce with some sort of alcohol in it.  The salmon and all of the side dishes were delicious. The skin on the salmon was nice and crispy. I have never been able to get the salmon skin this crispy at home and don't know how hard it is for a trained chef, but most places don't nail this dish the way The Porch nailed this dish. This dish was put together and cooked so well, that there is nothing to improve on with this dish. If you like salmon, this is a wondrous dish.  We will definitely be back soon.",

    "text": "After failing to get a table at reservations-required venues, and finding that many places were closed, I decided to bring my parents and brother to the Porch for Easter lunch. We arrived to a half-empty restaurant and sat down.  Our waiter, Brian, seemed awkward at first, but he was actually hilarious, and we all were laughing during much of our interactions.  We started out with an order of the Farm Bread--the honey butter and other two spreads that came with the bread were absolutely delicious. We almost ordered a second plate, but decided against it. I got the eggs benedict on special, which was...amazing. Prosciutto, arugula, and the most flavorful tomatoes I've ever eaten joined the perfectly cooked egg on top of a crispy English muffin.  My mom got the margherita pizza, which is something that usually doesn't excite me, but the presentation was adorable (little piles of cheese, peppers, and dried oregano) and the pizza itself was pretty great. I'm going to order one of the more adventurous pizzas next time.  Dad and brother both got the surf and turf special, which was filet and shrimp (not lobster, but the shrimp was seasoned and prepared excellently) atop garlic mashed taters and asparagus. I didn't sample theirs, but they were both very happy with the meal.  Best part? Before tax, our bill was only $80. Dad and I got a beer each (East End Big Hop ftw!), and brother got a housemade peach berry soda. Not bad for a wonderful lunch for four, if you ask me. My only worry about this place is the emptiness--it's great that I can walk in and sit down without a wait even on one of the busiest dining days, but more people need to find out about this place so it can stick around. Go to the Porch!",

My boyfriend and I had wandered over to Schenley Plaza to get a relatively cheap lunch at the Chinese stand, but we found it was still closed for the season.  So we decided to give The Porch a try.   We each had a pizza - I had the margherita pizza and he had the bolognese.  The flavor was good but they were overcooked and oily.  The pieces literally fell apart as we tried to pick them up off of the cookie sheet.  We had to flag our waitress down anytime we needed something (i.e. drink refills, the check) because she paid no attention at all to the tables.  When we asked for a to go box she brought us one small box that we had to stuff the leftovers in, which left us with a box stuffed with deformed, mushy pizza.    I would be satisfied with The Porch if it were at the right price - for what we got, it was definitely not worth it.",

They had daily specials that all sounded really good. I ended up getting the crab scramble. It was basically scrambled eggs, asparagus, and crab meat. The eggs were still runny when I got the dish which I was ok with but it seemed like something that I could have done on my own. It did come with potatoes which were also pretty tasty but they had fennel in them this day. Fennel is kind of an odd spice for me. It was not my favorite with the potatoes.  After going for brunch, I was intrigued by the Bianca pizza with goat cheese, fig jam, and arugula. A friend had gotten me onto having arugula on pizza and I wanted to try this one. It was just alright. I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese but It didn't have enough goat cheese or fig jam to pair well with the arugula. Aside from the arugula, the pizza was too mild for me. I had made my own pizza with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and prosciutto that came out way better than this pizza at The Porch. I will say that the dough was very well made.",

    "text": "Going through my reviews, you'll see a lot of reviews for Oakland lunch places. With a standing Friday lunch with a few other friends, we have all of our favorites and also try new places too.  The Porch is a DEFINITE favorite. With gorgeous outdoor seating for spring and summer with an outdoor fireplace for the fall weather, the atmosphere at The Porch is great. On top of that, the food is always en pointe.  Having been here SOOO many times and trying to get something different each time (which is easy because their menu is seasonal and rotating), I can speak to a large section of their menu.  Pizzas: Great to share with a friend, but they're so delicious you could almost eat a whole one on your own!  Burgers: Large and juicy with interesting ingredients to give your palette an interesting punch to the tongue on a normal lunch option.  Sides: Choosing between the side salad and the taters is hard because the salad is a great mix of arugula and spring greens with a light dressing that freshens your tastebuds while the taters are perfect fried crispy golden-ness with a spicy/curry ketchup.  Entrees: These change all of the time and oh man have I had some great ones! My favorite to this day is the Chile Verde with cilantro sour cream. Holy moley this was SO good! On my last trip there I had the brisket gnocchi. While I'm not a big gnocchi fan, I LOVED the brisket/sauce it came in.  Beers: Though it is a bit hard to order because there isn't a list right at the front and you have to go to the side to see the taps (though I think they may now have a list when you walk in the door), they have a well thought out selection of rotating and seasonal beers. It's not one of those annoying places that only has one type (sigh IPAs...), but instead always has a variety of options ranging from anything from stouts, to irish reds, to pilsners, to yes - IPAs, to more. They even had their own beer brewed by B2 from the honey from their bees on the rooftop.  I could talk for so much longer about the porch, so I won't because I hope you've gotten the impression now that this is a YES on your stop in schenley plaza.",

Fishy and gritty - told the server we were unhappy and he just said ok, so you are finished with these ? Yes, because they are bad. - had to ask for plates and forks to attempt to eat these monstrosities.  - ordered dinner - dinner arrived, had to ask for forks again  -$72.00 later when we finally got the check - we put $100 in cash down and he asked  if we needed change. Yes, because we are not leaving you a $28 tip for ok service ...  - pizza was good   Peeps - don't waste your time on this place...",

    "text": "I really wanted to give this place a five star review! But I just can't.  I work in Oakland and The Porch is usually where we go for work lunch meetings, since it's one of the only sit down restaurants in Oakland. I've been a few times, and my experience is always similar.  The food is definitely good, and different. I'm a vegetarian, and I've sampled their veggie burger, pizzas, and grilled cheese - all are delicious. They also have great lunch specials. They have a nice selection of beers as well.  I love the outdoor seating area, especially when the weather is nice. If I am looking to go to a happy hour after work and it's nice outside, I will pick The Porch every time.  What holds me back from five stars is the service and the price. I think they are a tad overpriced, especially for what you get in return. But the service every time I have been here has been pretty lackluster. I've never had a great service experience, which is disappointing, given all the other great things about The Porch.  I will continue to go because of the quality and location, but I do hope that I will see an improvement in the quality of service provided.",

It was sort of insane to me that they would allow this happen and not take immediate action to get the flies under control.    A year later, we decide to give it another chance.  Almost every single table we tried to sit at was dirty.  We went outside, also all dirty.  We chose the least dirty table.  The water came in jars.  Every single jar had little specks of food stuck to the inside of the glass.  I asked for the bartender to fill a glass of water, and the employees acknowledged that the jars were dirty but said they were simultaneously \"fine\" to drink from.  When I got to my table, I realized the cup they had given me was dirty.  Maybe their dishwasher isn't cleaning well?  Our food was delivered without plates, napkins, silverware.  At our request, our server went to get some, put down two napkins (there were 3 of us) and left.  I don't know if we were supposed to get our own.  It wasn't clear during the ordering process.    I liked the food both times.  I wish I enjoyed the dining experience.  Won't be back.",

    "text": "Very enjoyable place to have a classier meal than your standard college fare, even though it's right in the middle of CMU and UPitt. The inside is very clean, yet rustic and whenever I walk in it gives me a really happy feeling.  Make sure you come here on weekdays after 9pm for half-off pizzas! Their menu often changes with the season, but in the Fall get their Butternut Squash Pizza. The sweetness of the squash goes great with the cheese. The crust of all their pizzas are always crispy and they give you three little piles of toppings: parmesan cheese, herbs, chili peppers.  If you are a carnivore I recommend getting the Piggie Pie. It's covered with bacon, sausage, ham, etc. I find it a little bit too salty for my taste though.  Some of the dishes I ordered here are no longer on the menu because their menu changes seasonally, but here are some of the permanent sides and appetizers I recommend:  Cornbread - I love love love their cast-iron cornbread. It's one of the most savory, buttery, delicious corn bread I've ever had. They put real corn in it and it comes out piping hot. The top of it is crispy unlike normal cornbread. My favorite appetizer here.  Crispy Taters - Another thing worth trying are their roast potatoes. It's full of herbs and comes with a delicious curried ketchup.  For the entrees, go for the more expensive/classier dishes like the duck. My friend who's ordered the ribeye there once said it wasn't cooked right and later he felt sick after eating it.",

    "text": "Living in Oakland, I almost think of The Porch as my own back porch... but with food. It's right there if I need it for a big occasion, but it was just as good on a dinner date. They have food, drinks, and happy hour for both drinks and food (I think their pizza is half off M-Fri after 9PM). Two reasons that set this place apart for me are:  1. It's great for large groups. There's a lot of space available, as well as a pretty diverse menu so you can satisfy most of your group.  2. It's reliable. When our original brunch choice was closed for a wedding shower, we got a table for 11 at the Porch with no problems.   I think their servers are friendly, and the food has been consistently tasty. Usually when I go, I struggle with picking just one option because everything on the menu sounds delicious. I legitimately worry about missing out on my second choice.   The last time I went was for brunch, and there was just too much I wanted to eat. One of their specials that weekend was a skillet full of three warm cinnamon buns, drizzled with cream cheese glaze. Perfect for splitting and so homey. I ended up getting their yogurt with granola and stone fruit, and it was light and flavorful.   The prices are not cheap, but they're reasonable. This is definitely one of the nicer places in Oakland. I really like that they have daily specials to change up the menu, and maybe I'll get to try some in the future. Four and a half stars!",

There were 3 tables that sat after us.....well, the ordered, ate, and left all before we got our entree.  So after 55 mins of waiting and me getting walking in to ask for our check, they FINALLY have our food....the manager apologized and offered us a  to go box....as for the food, I had the Scottish salmon, the rest in my party had pizzas....the collective opinion on our lukewarm food was it'll make a turd.  Food was just mediocre a best, would've gave 3-stars, however after the service a one star is generous!",

Brunch is always cooked perfectly and never too crowded, so food comes in a timely manner. If you're on the run during the week the breakfast sandwiches and $1 coffee window are amazing! The pancakes are breakfast burger are favorites if you sit down.   The nice thing about the porch isn't just the fresh ingredients but the seasonal rotation of foods. They do a good job of providing different things at different times of the year to satisfy every craving. The pizzas in particular vary year round. The piggie pie in the fall and winter is particularly delicious. A year round staple that I highly recommend is the prime rib sandwich but it's almost always worth it to try one of the specials if they sound intriguing to you. My best luck with specials was when I had tacos. The veggie burger is also always fresh and hearty but the potatoes that come with it are amazing.   Dessert at the porch is always delicious too, ask about the gelato flavors. The only big complaint I have is the draft selection. I can find some rare drafts there but there's typically not much to choose from. The wine selection pairs well with most of the food but with the pizza id usually like a draft. Mixed drinks are stronger than at most places though which is great. All in all the porch is always a good idea.",

I would say the only cons that we experienced were that it can be difficult to find parking and our waitress wasn't very attentive to our table (however I wouldn't penalize a rating for one person). They also ran out of almond milk so that sort of stunk for the drinks we initially wanted.  We sat outside and were seated right away, just beat the rush as it soon became busy. We were very hungry: ordered the cinnamon roll as an appetizer to split, the breakfast pizza to split, the eggs benedict with shrimp, and the burrito (mostly pictured in my added photos to this review). They were all quite delicious however the portions are pretty large for me and we had a lot of leftovers. The pizza wasn't my favorite but it was different. The burrito I ate the other half for breakfast the next day (today!).  I didn't take a photo of the menu, regrettably, but I thought it was sort of limited for breakfast/lunch however the restaurant isn't all that big either so it is expected. I really like the location despite the parking issue as you're in the center of Pitt's campus and it is just a beautiful location to sit outside and get a nice view of Oakland/enjoy the outdoor area. I would go again to try more options! The prices are reasonable and everyone there seemed pleasant.",

Service was spotty, and our tables werent very clean.  Otherwise, good stop!",

My 3 stars is based solely on the fact that it takes FOREVER to get your food. You order at the front, take a number and wait...and wait...and wait. Oy! Make sure you have a lot of time on your hands if you are coming here.  Yesterday I ordered a tuna melt with side salad. I seriously do not think it should take 25 to 30 minutes to come out??? But hey it was an excellent tuna melt so it made my time worth it.",

The pizza is the best on campus with their unique flavors (last time I had squash on my pizza!).  The workers are always extremely nice and attentive to their tables. I love the decor, drinking out of mason jars, and the fact that they leave a bottle of water at the table. I always drink water fast, so being able to refill it myself is great!  Overall, a great restaurant for families, students on a budget, or a yummy date night!",

The breakfast window is one of the best deals in Oakland. The veggie breakfast sandwich on sourdough is awesome and very affordable. The only downside is that they are only open until 11.   Brunch is also delicious at The Porch. The potatoes are awesome, and the quiche of the day has been delicious in my experience.   Dinner is also great. The pizzas are delicious. The seasonal ratatouille pizza was my favorite, but the margarita pizza is also very good. The Porch has great salads, and the spinach artichoke dip is amazing. The grapefruit and sage gimlet is very flavorful and it is the perfect combination of bitter and sweet!   Service is great too - I have never had any issues and the waitstaff is very nice.",

They have a great atmosphere that is kid friendly and multiple outdoor seating areas (some covered and some open sky). The food and service are always consistent, and they have a great drink menu of unique cocktails and craft beer and wine.   The Brussel Sprouts are a great appetizer!  For dinner, I recommend the Salmon, Veggie Burger, or one of their pizzas. This is a great, open floor plan with a fun vibe and atmosphere.

Also located within walking distance of theater (Stephen Foster) and Phipps conservatory.  Went here for lunch with a group of four and sat in a booth by the window for good sunlight. You order at a counter top right as you walk in the front door but food is brought to your table. Water is self-serve. This all gives it a casual vibe, good for small groups.  We all enjoyed our food--entrees ranged from good (grilled cheese with a nice green salad for $8, chicken/bacon sandwich with home fries, which were whole potatoes, for $11) to very good (crispy veggie burger for $10) to excellent (pizza). It seems like they are known for their pizzas and ours had a delicious thin crust and several toppings (I think it was a meat lovers). It also comes with a few garnishes neatly on the platter. Easily fed one person for lunch and three others tried a slice. All for $14 so a good deal.  The menu is very basic American fare, so if you want something ethnic this isn't your bet. We liked it though!",

    "text": "So after a long day of walking the Phipps Conservatory grounds, my girl gang and I needed a watering hole and a hearty lunch. Surprisingly, this little area of the city doesn't seem to offer an abundance of highly rated hot spots (despite being in the heart of Pitt). But The Porch at Schenley proffered a cool name and what appeared to be an even cooler dining atmosphere.   Now, we almost turned on our heals as soon as we walked through the door. Upon entering the building we noticed the ever dreaded, walk-up window from which to order our meal. BLEH. Despite this setup's seeming rise in popularity, I utterly detest the fast casual feel. I am a foodie...a foodie that prefers the full dining out experience. I want the comfort and ease of taking my time to peruse the menu before being required to deliver my choices to the server. I want someone to fill my beverage and make sure that my table came adequately equipped with flatware and salt and pepper shakers. Call me a restaurant snob....or even maybe just lazy, but I like what I like.   But, as I relayed earlier, this area had few options. So we stayed. And I am certainly overjoyed that we did. We took a few minutes to glance over both the food and beverage menus before approaching the counter to place our order. We were given the customary table number and told to take a seat wherever we prefer...And let me just add that as we wound our way to our chosen table, we looked longingly at our fellow diner's plates. Everything looked so superb!  We orderd a little bit of everything so I am going to try to keep this short and sweet:   Margherita Pizza - Fun rustic plating, fresh grated parm (um,yes) and booming with flavor. Their pizza's are made in a large pizza oven and open flames make everything taste better, right?!  Fish & Chips - Fish was done to perfection as were the delectable, salty fries (cue drool). However, the fish to batter ratio was off. Far too much batter covered this flaky, delicious cod.   Grilled Chicken BLT w/ Crispy Potatoes - Perfectly grilled, packed with flavor....and OMG, the potatoes. If you give The Porch a try, GET THE POTATOES!  Sorbet (Rhubarb) - Amazing. Tart and sweet and the perfect consistency.   Zeppole - Honestly, a little disappointing. They were heavy, like they were made from a pizza or bread dough rather than your typical fritter dough.   Farm bread - Basic. I little flat in taste and texture. But the accompanying apple butter and raspberry jam were to die for.   All in all, The Porch is a tasty little joint in the middle of a quaint and quiet area. You can enjoy the local scenery while chowing down on some great food and booze that you didn't have to wait long for. So, should I find myself in the neighborhood again, I'll definitely be heading for The Porch....and you should too :)",

    "text": "If you're in Oakland looking for a nicer restaurant, The Porch is one of your best (and only) options. While I love their pizzas, the overall experience fell flat for me.   We arrived around 5:30 on a Saturday night and I was told the wait would be about 15 minutes. No worries! They take your number and call you which I like because you can step out of the restaurant if you wish. After getting out phone call, we were seated at these tiny high tops in the middle of the crowd of other people waiting. Our hostess even had to ask people to move in order to seat us. The stools were tiny and the table barely fit our two meals. We were constantly being bumped and grazed by people waiting for their table. It was also right by the door and on a 25 degree night, that was less than ideal. If they're going to use those tables, they need to make sure they're more separate from all the commotion.   I ordered their classic peach cocktail and the server told me they were out of the appropriate liquor, so I settled for red sangria. It was very sub par and lacked much flavor or spices. The star of the night was definitely the fall classic pizza I ordered, featuring butternut squash and caramelized onions. It was phenomenal. We ended with an apple crisp for dessert that was underwhelming. A lot of apple - no crisp. But I did enjoy that they feature Millie's vanilla ice cream on top.   Despite all the chaos, or server was extremely polite and attentive and I'd be willing to give this place another shot.",

They don't take reservations, but we did call ahead to let them know we were on our way so that they could plan ahead with their seating. I got the Bianca pizza ($13) and my friends and I shared the Crispy Taters ($4), Crispy Brussel Sprouts ($9), and Porch Wings ($11).  The Bianca was so good! It is definitely more of a sweet pizza than a savory one, and all of the strong flavors somehow worked together so amazingly well! I highly recommend this to anyone who likes goat cheese, fig, arugula, truffle oil, or all 4 like I do!  Despite the simplicity of the Crispy Taters, I was blown away! The skin was perfectly crispy, inside perfectly softened, and the curried ketchup was the cherry on top.  The Crispy Brussel Sprouts and Porch Wings were just average. They hit it spot on for tasting like they're supposed to. However for the price, I did expect a little bit more of each, considering how much came with the Crispy Taters!  I would definitely come back and order a whole Crispy Taters just for myself and definitely the Bianca again! Especially since I forgot to take pictures this time around..",

If you asked anyone, they know that my least favorite condiment of all time is ketchup, but this stuff is actually amazing.  Above all their cinnamon roll (*one of the greatest things I've ever eaten). This is best split between 3-4 people because the pastry is massive with heaping amounts of cream cheese frosting.

We had a special menu already selected for us and on the table, and the Porch was so organized, it only took two people to serve our entire group.  TWO PEOPLE.  My students were overjoyed with all of the delicious treats (many opted for the kale salad, which they raved over), and no one could resist the cinnamon rolls baked cast iron skillets.    This was a truly wonderful stop for my group.  The restaurant was wonderfully located, easy to access (in spite of nearby construction), and the staff was on top off their game.  I was even able to enjoy a few cocktails at the bar while my students explored downtown a bit after their meal, and let me tell you...their bloody mary's are NOT to be missed (two different types!).

I looked at other people's tables and their food looked very yummy as well! We also had a very nice waiter and a lovely view of the Cathedral of Learning, which for first time tourists like us, was a treat! Would recommend to anyone cisiting Pittsburgh and its colleges!",

    "text": "I do love the porch. It was the 1st restaurant we went to in Pittsburgh 4 years ago when my son was checking out CMU. We always return every time I visit and Always have a few college kids with us! The menu is fun, the food is always good quality. The location is awesome too! A great little park right outside... sometimes movies playing outside.   My only reason for not giving 5 stars is the staff is hit or miss. Last month 6 of us met there as soon as we finished checking into our hotel... Monday night about 9pm I felt like the staff was really not interested in us. Such as... after driving all day, I would of LOVED to have a glass of wine but the server did not even come over to ask if we wanted a beverage until our whole party was there. 3 of us arrived about 15-20 Minutes before the college kids met us. We were so happy to all be together that it wasn't worth making a fuss over the lack of service.",

Placing your order at counter and having it get delivered to you at a table is operationally smart to the flow of the place but a bit rushed to select something fast, maybe ask questions, etc...? since the line moves quick.  Nice University of Pittsburgh views all around. Pretty comfortable and bright. Decent prices for the quality.  My wife's Smoked Turkey sandwich was phenomenal. My Chicken BLT was good except the grilled chicken (was not burnt) tasted a bit burnt from the grill. The Shrimp Salad that my daughter had was very good.  My favorite item was the \"Tots\". Delicious seasoned mini potatoes. So perfectly cooked.",

For $14-20 a salad, a person dining at this establishment would like to feel that they are eating a properly priced meal, salad greens and dressing do not cost that much, Chef Kev for the love of God give the diners bread.",

The restaurant wasn't crowded.  It had a nice laid-back vibe and the open \"garage doors\" let you feel close to the folks on the grass in the park.  Service was friendly and attentive. The weaknesses:  The prices.  I ordered a sangria for $8.00 which was very ordinary.  Too sweet, no fresh fruit to speak of, served in a small glass.  I ordered the green chili with jasmine rice. Very nice flavor, smaller portion, $22.00.  To be honest, for what it was, $12.00 would have been a fair price.  My wife had the quarter chicken.  Again, nice flavor, but in this case the chicken was under cooked (blood coming from the leg-thigh joint).  Seemed very fresh, so I ate it for her, but again, not nearly worth the $18.00 price.   I would recommend this restaurant for its strengths, but I would caution the diner to beware of the prices.  Avoid high-priced specials.  I think we could have had just as nice an experience sharing a pizza and getting the small caesar salads, but it would have been half the $75.00 w/ tip cost.",

I have to mark it down a bit because their service was very odd -- at a table of four for lunch, one order came out completely wrong and one came 15-20 minutes later than the other three.  I had the chicken sandwich.  It tasted great, but they slather their bread in so much butter that I'm struggling to remember what the actual filling was like.  Also, despite pushing even further into heart attack territory, I'd recommend getting the fried taters instead of the side salad, since the salad consisted only of lettuce with vinegar.  Not even a tomato.  Worth $9 for lunch?  Not sure.  [update] Got the turkey sandwich my second time.  Came on plain bread, no butter overload!  Much better :)",

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday afternoon with mum and boyfriend after a visit to the Natural History Museum. Immediately I was a bit annoyed by the menu... Options included breakfast items, salads and a few specialty pizzas. Admittedly, I'm a bit picky, so I was getting frustrated trying to find something to eat.   In the meantime, we ordered drinks. I asked for water with a lemon and got a small glass of water with no ice and a bowl of lemons. Ok... so then I ordered a lemonade, which was *awful* - it tasted like fake lemon juice dumped into some water with no sugar. Even dumping a pack of Splenda into it did absolutely nothing. Finally I just asked for a glass of ice and pored my tepid water over that.  The meal got better when we ordered. I asked if it was possible, since they had a smaller size on the kids' menu, that I get a regular pepperoni pizza. So they adjusted the Margarita pizza to have pepperoni on it and went light on the sauce for me without any trouble. It was served on a baking sheet with little piles of dried basil, red pepper flakes and powdered Parmesan on the side and it was very good. Nice thin crust, fire baked and definitely made by hand.    So my experience was OK, and just that. Service was OK, too. Not a bad idea to stop in for a quick bite, but I get the feeling that this place is much better if you're looking for a drink at night or brunch for the morning after.",

    "text": "After finishing the Race for the Cure, my friend and I headed over to The Porch to grab some breakfast/brunch.  The menu wasn't that extensive - there was a selection of some breakfast items and then some pizzas from what I recall.    Maybe their menu offering was different since it was Mother's day and on their website, I can't seem to find their \"breakfast/brunch\" menu.    My friend went with the quiche and I chose the egg sandwich with cheese and it said it had short ribs (but I don't recall any short ribs on the sandwich).  I have to say the sandwich hit the spot, even if it was missing the short ribs.  It was huge!  But I was hungry after the run...my only complaint was that it was missing something - like it needed some other seasoning besides just cheese and eggs...perhaps the short ribs would have made the difference!   The sandwich was served with a side of potatoes, they were little round full potatoes that were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I really enjoyed them.    I really like the look and feel of this place.  Open, yet comfy!",

    "text": "So after reading all the bad reviews for The Porch at Schenley on here, and there are plenty, I was VERY skeptical to try it this weekend. We had friends staying in Oakland for a wedding and we preferred to do brunch in a more traditional brunch spot that we know like Lawrenceviille, downtown, etc. When I heard we were going here I was bummed.   AND BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!! Exceptional breakfast. Exceptional. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is I felt the menu could have had a few more brunch items like sweet items, pancakes, a French Toast, something. It was pretty much all savory. And they had some basic items that coulda been better.   Basic items  that were off - biscuits. Ordered a side of buttermilk biscuits with apple butter. The biscuits had been run through a toaster. Everyone knows biscuits should be warm and soft, not toasted. But flavor wise they were awesome, and the apple butter was to die for. Several of us at our table had the egg sandwich on rustic farm bread with gruyere. It was to die for. Such good bread. And perhaps the best home fries I've had in Pittsburgh.   Everyone else at our table had the crab eggs benedict and felt it was one of the best eggs bennies they've ever had, loved that the English Muffin appeared home made. My best friend had the biscuits and gravy and was so complimentary on how spicy the gravy was and how it somthered the biscuits just right. My wife ordered the burger with egg on it and her medium burger was SPOT ON. Most Pittsburgh restaurants think medium is this pinkish grey color. This was a textbook medium - hot and red with the blood just starting to run through it. Exceptional burger.   Presentations are great - pork belly served in a cast iron skillet. Old milk bottles served the water. Napkins were a cloth washcloth. Great presentations, exceptional.   Worth the trip. DO IT. You won't regret it. ON the way out we saw the pizzas presented on half pans ( baking sheets ) Killer presentation. KILLER!",

For dinner, The Porch feels like it's trying to be something it's not.  For lunch, it's right where it's supposed to be.  A more moderate price point, a more casual dining experience, and a selection of sandwiches all fit the space and the cuisine much better.  Choices are colorful, well-rounded, and fresh.  There's a casual elegance that begins to emerge, and I hope the management sees what the restaurant achieves mid-day and stops trying so hard once the sun begins to set.  This is a great place to grab some tasty and good quality food for lunch, and it fits any crowd.  I'd feel comfortable taking parents, professors, students, kids, coworkers, friends, and acquaintances here for lunch.  But I still wouldn't go for dinner.",

The pizza I ordered was good but we weren't sure how to get our iced teas refilled which didn't last very long on a 90 degree day.

The grilled cheese was good--crispy, nice-quality bread with cheddar--but nothing fancy. Kids would like it. The soup was hearty and filling, and its portion was larger than what I was expecting.  The Porch supposedly makes it a priority to use local produce, so I assume that the butternut squash soup was probably made with local ingredients. They didn't specifically advertise the source either way, though. It would be nice if they had some way of indicating the source of their ingredients, I think--I don't make a huge deal out of it, but it IS a selling point for me if I'm eating something local and in-season. They're missing out by not pushing that aspect of their business more.  At $7, the grilled cheese is the cheapest \"lunch meal\" on the menu, and between the generous sandwich and the large cup (or small bowl?) of soup, it was pretty filling for the price. And of course, the water bar's flavored waters are always great!",

    "text": "So, as a former Eat'n Park employee, it was my obligation to go to the restaurant on their opening week. I'm writing my review late, so I imagine some things have changed, but seeing that I probably won't be back for a while, I wanted to put my 2 cents in.  The layout and atmosphere was beautiful and unique. It's a real shame they opened in the late fall, because The Porch is definitely a place built for the warmer months. It has a lot of large garage-type doors meant to blend the outdoor area with the diners. While it was still gorgeous on the inside, even in the cold, there was clearly something missing when you looked around and noticed that the nuts and bolts will compliment a Summer breeze better than snow.  The food was pretty decent. We ordered 2 appetizers, which were wonderful. My meal, the roasted pig sandwich, was good, but a little salty and bland. I'm not knocking them here by the way, because I do understand that it takes time for a restaurant to figure out the flavors and it doesn't always happen within the first week. It isn't until a lot of patrons are able to offer feedback that they begin to refine their dishes.  The price is where it gets a little bit tipsy for me. Our meal was $80, which isn't terrible, but it comes off a little more casual than the receipt. But I'm not dumb either, we did get 2 beers each, 2 appetizers and a meal each. The money was well spent, but it was difficult for me to understand exactly what type of restaurant they wanted to be. Classy? Casual? Either way ... go try them out! They are a welcomed addition to the Oakland area.  Before I close this ... one pitfall did hit me. My friend ordered a pizza and it came on a huge cookie sheet / pan. While this aesthetically was kinda cute, it took up a ton of space and downgraded the experience slightly. It goes back to my statement about what they were trying to be. Who wants to eat slightly pricey pizza on a pan that takes up most of their table space? Just a thought!",

The food was tasty, but a bit disappointing. The menu is not very large and of traditional American inspiration (syrup and rib-eye, eg). It feels very Pittsburgh in a way: large portion that fills you more than fulfill. The two dishes we tried were a bit dry. It's not exactly cheap, so for that price I expected something a bit better.  On the other hand, they have some beer from east end brewery. So, you can forgive a lot.   I may be back for lunch.  Update: I have now been there a few times for lunch. I'd say that it is a good 4 stars for lunch. Nice pizzas, nice burgers, reasonable price, quickly served, great location for lunch. In fact, it has become my favorite place for lunch in Oakland. So, 4 stars instead of three. Still, unlikely I'll go there for dinner, though.",

Well, two years later, I'm sitting here on Yelp, putting my foot in my mouth.  The Porch is a WONDERFUL addition to the Oakland restaurant scene.  Yes, it sits on Schenley Plaza, but just on the edge.  Yes, it encroaches on one of Pitt's few green spaces, but the architecture is so beautifully done that it fits right in.  Yes, it is owned by Eat n' Park, but there are certainly no smiley cookies served here.  The menu has that trendy local/organic/homemade vibe, but in a delicious way, not a pretentious way.  I took my mom here when she was visiting for the weekend *.  We decided to each get the featured soup (pear and parsnip!) for our appetizer.  We then shared the Bianca (fig jam, goat cheese, mozzarella, arugula) and Harvest Pie (butternut squash, leeks, sage, taleggio cheese) pizzas.  It ended up being more than enough.  We took half of each pizza home.  Two Porch meals for the price of one?  I'll take it.  The inside of the restaurant is really pretty cool.  If you were to mix rustic, chic, simple and industrial in a blender, you'd get The Porch.  That's the only way I can think to describe it.  The whole time I felt like I couldn't possibly be in South Oakland.  It is probably important to note that The Porch is fairly expensive.  Our dinner for two came out to $37, before tip and we didn't order drinks.  But the next time I'm in the mood to splurge on a great meal, I'm definitely coming back!  * Pitt and CMU students - This is a great place to take your parents when they come to visit!

As to the ambience, there is terrible noise of the huge crowd that swarm during lunch hour or early evening, so best to get in an hour later. It is your basic self serve restaurant but with otherwise decent food selection. However, hot food served is cooler temp than they should be, especially in the evening service.",

During dinner earlier this week, I saw a mouse run through the dinning room. I was shocked and disgusted. I immediately notified a waitress, whom then notified the manager. However, the manager did not seem very concerned at she swept through the dinning room once and then went to socialize with other workers. I regret to say I won't be dining there anymore. At least until a health inspector deems the establishment eligible to serve food. This has been an ongoing problem apparently, as I found out when I did research on their previous inspections. Please clean yourself up.",

I usually only get their Caesar salad when I've gone there, and that's only been like 2 times. I'd try it there again. The first time I went was before there was12 issues of E Coli at The Porch, the situation was fixed  and then we went back awhile after that issue.",

    "text": "The only reason that I am giving this restaurant 2 stars is for the atmosphere, location, and idea.  This is one of those places that survive solely on sight.  The restaurant itself is very nice and located right next to the park.  I love love love the porch theme and atmosphere, except it can be noisy.  Now the food on the other has a lot to be desired.  Eat 'n Park needs to evaluate what type of food that the offerings should be here.  They can not continue to venture into other 'types' of dining while continuing to do the same old foods.  Just because it has a fancy name is isn't fancy.  I had the Grilled Farm Bread Sandwich (Fried Egg, house-cured pork belly, Vermont Cheddar, & Crispy Taters), this basically equated to a bacon scrambler with over easy eggs, cheddar cheese, on Italian Bread which is something like $6.99 at eat 'n park compared to $9.00 here.  That is not upscale--a nice plate, with a nicer atmosphere has to have better food.  My wife had the RUSTIC BREAD SALAD (Grilled Sourdough Bread, Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Mozzarella, Frisee, Radicchio, Housemade Coppa, Basil Pesto) the bread was burnt leaving an aftertaste, and the basil pesto sauce was awful.  For $11.00 I expect a lot more.  Eat 'n Park got the decor, location, and atmosphere correct but they need to think outside the box when it comes to the food.  We really wanted to like this place.",

I ordered the Bianca pizza and it was out of this world. Most of all, our waiter Christopher was the bee's knees. This guy was friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. Not too many young guys can handle a table of rowdy women with such grace. Every order was correct and he was very patient. 5 stars for Christopher.",

    "text": "Just came back from a very nice 67 degree sunny Sunday early March brunch at The Porch.  I didn't realize it was located across from GSPIA's Posvar Hall and the Hillman Library until I mapped out directions.    We used the call ahead seating to reserve a table for 4 and were seated immediately when we arrived 30 min. later. The atmosphere is very hip with a mix of tables and booths.  Had it been a few degrees warmer, we would have sat outside on the patio.  I started out with a bloody Mary which was pretty spicy, the way I like them.  I ordered the Sunnyside burger, cooked medium, which comes with a sunny side up egg (not fried, but next time...and there will be a next time...I'll be sure to ask that they cook the egg a few seconds longer.). The burger was excellent!  Very tasty and cooked perfectly.  It came with sauted onions and roasted red peppers.  No need for any ketchup or other topping.    The bird ordered the pizza bolognese with Cunningham Farms Beef Bolognese, Fresh Ricotta Cheese, Basil.  It came out on a metal tray which I thought was cool.  It was very tasty and she said she would order it again.  Our friend ordered the PIGGIE PIE that came with House-cured Meats, Mozzarella, and Basil.  This too was very tasty.  (yes, I must sample all meals).  Was it a little pricy?  Perhaps a little to be a regular breakfast joint, but not enough to prevent us from returning soon.  Especially when the weather turns a little warmer.",

    "text": "The Porch was a welcomed addition to the space near the Cathedral of Learning for going out after academic talks or taking visiting scholars to a nice lunch in a good-looking place nearby. The food was good enough although limited (as many other reviewers have pointed out), and the drinks are excellent and they have a variety of beers available.   This place has gone downhill since it first opened, however -- particularly the service. I have only had one server in this place do even a halfway decent job, and I think he was actually a dishwasher or cook filling in for a server during a desolate lunch shift. Every other time, the server takes upwards of 20 minutes to bring drinks, it's like pulling teeth to get a pitcher of water delivered to the table, and forget about asking for refills or silverware or condiments -- they'll stop by the table and only take one person's request, then disappear for another 20 minutes, after which you'll need to remind them of your request.   The most disappointing thing happened just yesterday, when one server who was working a dinner/happy hour service announced that she was sick with the flu that's been going around as she delivered my colleague's salad to the table. I feel bad for the woman for being sick and working through it, of course, but perhaps management should allow their sick employees to take nights off so they don't feel the need to announce their misery to their customers.   In short, the service in this place is so bad that the food doesn't even make it worth going. However, it remains the closest and most viable option for many academics in the area, and I think that is the sole reason this place will continue to survive.",

My first time we went with a group of 14 on a single check, and several of the orders were misplaced for a while.  The servers seemed disgruntled to deal with our big party.  However, the last two times, service has been much better, with staff coming over to wipe down our table as soon as we selected it.  Food: Sandwiches are tasty (I particularly like the pork and arugula), although the bread is cut really thick and is rather hard to chew through.  Pizzas are quite tasty (definitely of the thin-crust variety, so stay away Chicagoans!) as are the salads.  Also, rocket=arugula (it's a British thing; not sure if they're trying to be posh or what).  Beware the cilantro water!  They often have 2 jugs of tab water, one plain and one with lemons and other fruit, and a heaping bunch of cilantro.  I love cilantro, but this was undrinkable.  Go for the plain.    All in all, the place isn't as cheap as some nearby Craig St. options, but it makes up for it in quality of the food.  Also, half off pizzas late at night, something like 9-close.  Might have to go back for that!",

The pizza is okay because it's fresh, but they don't know what margherita means. The 'Piggie Pie' with jam and pork is actually really good, and my favorite of the pizzas.   Drinks are expensive unless it's happy hour, and even then you have to be AT the bar, not seated in the restaurant, to get the happy hour price. Restrictions like this are really prohibitive, especially when the actual 'bar' is only ten feet long. Even the servers don't understand the policy, and I'm sure its effects get taken out mainly on them.   Overall: Okay food, busy & popular for its location. Never had a HUGE problem with service, aside from occasionally waiting a bit too long for some things.   PS - I personally understand the charge for bread service - I've worked in restaurants my whole life. I would personally never charge for bread, but OK, I get it. Even so, $4 for 'Farm Bread' with little tins of jelly and butter is a bit much.",

The dinner menu includes some full plate entrees. It is here that everything falls apart.  I ordered a plate of salmon. The fish itself was merely passable (a little dry). It was presented with some sort of eggplant goo and some stir-fried greens (kale?). I love eggplants and green vegetables, but these three ingredients completely did not play well together.   As another reviewer also mentioned -- at night time, the space feels a little dark and dingy (as opposed to intimate and romantic). The service pace was also off -- everything was slow, but not in a well-managed sort of way (e.g., long stretch of wait time between seating and drinks being served -- and no, the restaurant was not busy that night.)  So, the lesson I learned: stick to lunch!",

    "text": "Not gonna lie, I'm super shocked that this place is owned by Eat'n Park, which is one of my least favorite eating establishments on the face of this earth. But I'm definitely glad that this place popped up in Oakland rather than the traditional Eat'n Park that was rumored to be planned for the location. I'm also thankful that the building is well-designed and doesn't look like an ugly eyesore in the middle of Schenley Plaza. So while I wish that the space had been left empty and full of nice green grass, it is what it is and at least The Porch has some pretty decent food to show for it.  It is an odd location. I don't think the average broke college student is going to be too excited about $8 margaritas and $20 duck drumsticks. Questionable business plans aside, I really enjoyed my dinner here. The calamari with zucchini straws was perfect! Tentacles included (my fav, I'll fight for those!) so you know it's the good stuff, and it came with lots of lemon wedges and a homemade marinara sauce. It's like they read my mind! I also was in love with the pork belly with pumpkin and fennel...so autumnal! The dish was pretty greasy but hey, it's a chunk of pure animal fat, so what's a little bit of extra grease, really? Other than that it was ridic tasty. The homemade soda was also fabulous though it would definitely taste better with vodka (why do they only have two cocktails on the menu? and one is tequila-based? bummer).  The one part of my meal that fell short was the Rieger Pork Soup. The concept is perfection--french onion soup with pork. Where could that go wrong? Unfortunately, the soup was completely devoid of flavor. Once I dumped half the salt shaker in it, it became edible, but the main problem was that the onions were not caramelized at all. Topped with a bland slice of cheese, it was the only disappointment of my meal.  I do have to say, all the raves about the atmosphere are kind of off. I could imagine it being a great lunch spot with all the natural light coming through the windows, but at dinnertime, the lights were WAY too bright. The cheap cafeteria vibe (or should I say, Eat'n Park vibe) was totally offputting and an inappropriate match for the sophisticated food. Otherwise, the space is cute, cozy, and well-utilized. Install a dimmer on the lights and I'll be back for sure!",

    "text": "They say that this place is part of the Eat n' Park diner chain, but you wouldn't know it when you walk in. It's rather upscale inside, but you also get the feel like you're on an organic farm or something, too. The windows are very big, so the place gets a lot of light, which is nice.   I've been there for lunch a few times, and I have to say that you could feed two people down the street at Pamela's for less than it costs for one person here (entree, salad, drinks), and the food would be a little more normal. However, the clientele at the Porch seems more suited to its dishes; everything is sophisticated (and complicated), and I was a bit taken aback at first because I ordered a turkey sandwich and it came all done up with sauces and fancy cheese and whatnot. Be warned, they don't seem to have full service at lunch; you order at the counter and they give you you're drink and bring you your food, but that's it. You have to get your own refills and go back up to get more food.  So for lunch, I'm not feeling the love, especially if you're on a college budget.  I went there last night for dinner, though, and The Porch redeemed itself. I met my mum and we started with the cheese plate appetizer. It comes with provolone, goat cheese, fresh mozzarella, blue cheese, drops of olive oil and honey, nuts, apple and pear slices, and bread of course. That was delicious. I had a generous Caesar salad, which was also pretty good. Then for our main course, we both had the ribeye with \"crispy taters.\" The steak was big and juicy, and although I was skeptical at first, the curry ketchup was excellent. The potatoes were whole little potatoes that were fried I guess, and they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They were playing a good bit of classic rock, so we both really liked the atmosphere. Our waitress was excellent. uThe downside; it was $75 for the two of us, without including the tip. It is a fancier place, though, so we expected it. I always like to see new places open, so if you're looking for an upscale dinner in Oakland, give this place a try.",

We were greeted upon arrival and seated by a very polite young gentleman. Cons: I thought their menu was slacking--they only offered a \"brunch\" menu at 1pm on a Saturday with a very limited amount of items. The biggest problem I had with The Porch (and nearly ruined our experience) was our server, Rochelle (according to our receipt, she never introduced herself). She had the BIGGEST chip on her shoulder and clearly is not a good fit for the service industry. We barely could get our order out before she turned and walked away...which happened each time we asked for anything (more water, ranch, and napkins). She was very short and seemed like she hated life. Hopefully this was just an off day for her.",

Clean, modern chateau feel that makes me wish there was an ice skating rink on the lawn.  Alas...  For lunch, you order and take a number.  For dinner, it's full service.   The lunch menu ranges from $7-14 for an entree.  The grilled cheese was made with cheddar and thick thick bread--I approve!  It also came with the day's soup  so that's probably the best value on the menu.  To compare: $7 here with soup and  $5.99  for a grilled cheese with no soup at Hemingway's.  The chopped salad (pulled chicken, feta, carrots, cucumbers, sprouts with honey dijon) was super fresh...only romaine lettuce here!  The chicken was perhaps slightly drier than I preferred, but it is pulled chicken.  The server was very nice when I asked for no tomatoes.  At the beverage bar, the water is in jugs with lemon or cucumbers, which is a small detail I like.  It looks pretty and helps me forget I'm still in Oakland.  The wine list looked fine, but I was interested in the brews.  Like the food, it's all local:  Penn, East End, Great Lakes, plus one seasonal at $5 each.  Only one thing kept me from the beers--the craft cocktails.  I ordered an \"Almost\" Arnie.  Having just returned to The 'Burgh from an extended stint in the South, I was prepared to be disappointed.  But, nope!  This Arnie is The Porch's own Limoncello and fresh brewed iced tea with mint: sweet but not too sweet, the mint was properly muddled, and the tea was strong.  I loved Arnie...it will be a July wedding for the two of us.  Like others have said and will continue to say, the food is expensive for Oakland.  You either want to pay extra for better food or you don't.  However, the drink prices are great for the quality.  If I can have a $5 microbrew that I want here or a $4 Miller Lite that I don't want at any other bar in Oakland, then I'll pay the extra dollar.

The water is absolutely delicious!  It might be worth it just to go back for the water in all honesty.  My meal on the other hand left a little to be desired. I decided to order the Veggie Burger.  I am assuming that they make their own veggie burgers in house.  It was the single worst veggie burger I've ever had in my life.  It was possibly the worst sandwich I've ever had.  It had the consistency of firm oatmeal and even had a faint cinnamon taste.  It was topped with the absolute worst sun-dried tomatoes I have ever had.  I could not finish it and I will never ever order it again.    Luckily, I ordered potatoes as my side dish.  The potatoes were fantastic.  The texture and buttery-herb taste was absolutely delicious.  I really enjoyed the ketchup too!    All in all, I want to try this place again.  I will try the pizza next time but do yourself a favor and NEVER get the veggie burger.",

    "text": "So, I am giving the 3 because of service.  The food was very good. The pizza is a individual pizza, but more than enough if you order an appetizer. My girlfriend and I wanted to try Porch and decided tonight would be a great night to go.   We each ordered a glass of wine. When I ordered my wine the server Nick questioned my order saying \"That is a sweet wine\".  Yes sir, I know what wine I want to drink tonight with my pizza. We then ordered the Farm Bread appetizer with Honey Butter, Apple Butter, and Fig, as well as the Bianca Pizza with goat cheese and figs. Nick made sure to comment about our order expressing his opinion about the small amount of food we ordered.   Our bread came out 5 minutes later; Nick did not explain which spread was which and just walked away. We still did not have our wine. The manager walked by our table looking for our wine glasses, noticed we did not have any and delivered our wine.  By the time our pizza came our water jug was empty. Nick did not ask us how our bread or wine was. He did not ask if we needed anything else. The pizza was as we expected. Small enough for one hungry person to eat, but large enough for 2 people not looking to stuff their faces.   Our meal is now over. Nick comes to us with a small jar with our check inside. He asks if there is anything else he can do for the night, we said no and he gave us the check. Our plates are empty and nicely placed by the end of the table to be cleared. I am calculating the tip I want to give him since our food was brought out in a timely manner and was an excellent meal. However, I was not sure how much to tip for the service I received. We decided on a 15% tip and I rounded up to make the total bill a round dollar. While doing this Nick came by and looked over my shoulder. When I was done signing the check my girlfriend was still finishing her wine, and I joked \"Watch him come take the signed check.\" Lo and behold Nick walks by, swiftly grabbing the jar, never clearing the table, and without a \"Good Night\" or \"Thank you\", he was gone....  Watching other servers, I know Porch has some good staff. It is a shame that I was given such a bad server for my first experience there.",

I've had the veggie burger here, with a side salad, on multiple occasions and it really hits the spot. Tasty. Like the fancy water. I once had a salad here I didn't like, but I can't remember which one it was. Overall, a great place. I do have one suggestion- the whole take a number, seat yourself is nice but I noticed the staff having a hard time finding the right number to deliver the food. Perhaps there is a better way?",

PROs: - One of my friends was visiting from Italy and tells me that the pizza at The Porch is the closest he's had to northern Italian pizza EVER in the US.   I guess that's a good thing if you're looking for authentic Italian pizza.   I enjoyed the pizza; thin, crispy crust and NOT overloaded with toppings.   - The sandwich and salad I had was fresh and crisp. - The service was okay; friendly and prompt but the server did disappear and not check back after we had our entrees.  CONs: - Out of several menu items on both visits, but that could be cost of serving fresh food.  I'll be back.  It's good to have a comfortable place like The Porch so close by.",

We ate lunch here first, prior to visiting the Phipps Conservatory. The salad greens were the freshest and best I've eaten. Each bite was better than the first. And the veggie burger was delicious. The coffee was awesome too. We at breakfast, lunch and dinner and had no complaints with any meal. While the dinner prices were more than we usually spend, I was not disappointed at all. Each bite was a delectable. The wait staff were very attentive and nice, and a shout out to the woman at the breakfast counter, who could have turned us away since we arrived on the cusp of 11:00, but served us anyway. I have nothing but high praise for this establishment. My only recommendation would be to add more vegetarian friendly entrees. You made our visit to Pittsburgh an A++!",

    "text": "After going there for brunch recently (for which I'd give it four stars), I insisted on trying it again for dinner, as I had seen the pizzas coming out of the oven as we were leaving and they looked/smelled ridiculous. It made me hungry and I had just stuffed myself full of delicious  brunch foods.  However. The second was not the same experience. We were highly disappointed at the server not being able/willing/whatever to help us with our appetizer selection. When it came (artisan cheese plate), it made us both frown. Four bold, flavorful, strong cheeses, fig spread and honey, bowl of olives, crostini, almonds. (Boyfriend, when I offered him some almonds, said \"No thanks, I just had some in the car.\" Touche.) Just a poor arrangement of flavors...truly. Like, throw some sharp provolone and mozz on a plate and call it a day. (AHEM. YOU ARE EAT N PARK) Boyfriend entree was the half chicken. Have you ever seen one of those cute little chickies around Easter time? Sweet little baby chickens? That is the approximate size of the chicken they butchered for this clove (????)-filled  dish, complete with \"smoked potatoes\", i'm sorry, WHAT?  I believe it was when he bit into a whole clove that he asked me to make him shells and cheese when we got home. Then I started adding up our approximate bill....  All of that aside, the pizza was, in fact, as ridiculously delicious as it looked/smelled on that brunch day, and the drinks were PERFECTION (the \"almost arnie\" and \"porch pink lemonade\"). Probably some of the best mixed specialty drinks I've had anywhere.  So my point is...it is supremely disappointing that such a cool place (atmosphere A+++) is trying so hard. Just shut up and make a bunch of awesome pizzas. Because they are that--awesome.  If you go, get the pizzas and some fun drinks. Don't attempt an entree. You've been warned.",

As others have noted, service was a bit slow--my draft beer came shortly after we ordered, but my friend's coffee had to be requested halfway through the meal since it still hadn't shown up. I had the pork sandwich, which was pretty good. If I go back I will definitely try one of the wood-fired pizzas, which looked delicious. All in all it was good, but not great. I wouldn't hesitate to go back, but there are other places in the Oakland/Shadyside area that I would probably return to first.",

Today, my mom and I were served by Josh, a waiter at The Porch. Let me just say that Josh is fantastic! My mom and I had both been on the phone with our family when he first arrived, and then again...and then again. We also had no clue what we wanted to eat, asked one too many questions and even ordered food for someone that hadn't even arrived yet. (We were probably the most annoying customers at the time) but instead of getting frustrated, Josh handled all our questions, cares, and needs with grace and a warm smile. He was more than accommodating, as well as thoughtful. I appreciate Josh, we need more people/waiters like him. The food was also delicious. (Have never been disappointed in that respect)",

I came here the other night for dinner and got an old fashioned and the sesame encrusted salmon with rice. It was definitely a good choice! The salmon was done just as ordered. The only suggestion I have is to space out the tables a little more. I get wanting to accommodate as many people as possible, but it ends up getting cramped around the two seater tables. And it's quite awkward when your butt is in someone's face if you get up :)  I would surely come back and try more drinks and food!",

    "text": "So once upon a time, I wrote a review where I said that I didn't recommend The Porch for a full, satisfying meal. At the time I meant what I said, because I honestly hadn't had a super awesome lunch or dinner here yet. But now that's changed, so I feel obligated to update my opinion in writing.  I admit, I'm not at the point that I can say \"yeah 5 stars!\" - I haven't quite forgotten The Porch's history of having hit or miss service, or the bitter quiche and overcooked \"meh\" burger that drove me away previously. Still, the last few times I've been here have showed consistent and major signs of improvement, particularly in terms of the food. I now have an excellent favorite go-to food here: their prime rib sandwich. It's juicy, delicious, and perfectly topped with cheese, greens and onions - the whole combination just melts in my mouth. Add in a side of The Porch's amazing crispy taters and I'm set - mmmm! I've also had the chance to sample their pizzas and a couple salads, and I haven't had any complaints about those - I actually really enjoyed sampling the interesting ingredient mixes concocted for those menu items.  Oh, and of course I have to give a thumbs up on their drinks! Unique cocktails like the Pineapple Sage Margarita make this an excellent place to go for a happy hour, and I absolutely have to give a nod of respect to any place that carries Wigle Whiskey options (yum!).   I think that despite the rocky start we had, I'll definitely keep coming back to explore The Porch's menu now - based on my last few meals here, they've really started to find their stride in terms of meal planning. Besides, I feel obligated to help support any business that does as much to use local ingredients and even make some of their own as The Porch does. Perfect they are not, but they're definitely a two-thumbs up kind of place!",

Make sure to make a reservation or you'll probs end up waiting an hour to be seated. They have really long tables to accommodate large parties and super comfy booth chairs.   Food - I've tried everything on their menu. Chorizo & eggs are my favorite for brunch and the margherita pizza for dinner. Food gets 5 stars. *Chorizo & eggs are pictured below.

We all decided on The Porch because of its convenient proximity to the Music Hall, and general reputation for having alright food. We were seated, the waiter took our order, and after about 10 minutes of waiting for our food... a manager came up to the table and informed us that they would no longer serve us, and we would have to leave because my friend still had a cup of coffee from a local coffee house back from when we were out walking around. I understand why they would not want us to be bringing in outside beverages... But they should not have seated us and wasted our time if it was going to be that big of a deal. I will NOT be returning to The Porch anytime soon.",

We waited about 10 minutes until the greeter walked by and we asked how do we get our food?  He replied I'll get someone for you(Gee thanks).  After about 5 minutes the waiter came over and he acted like we were bothering him and he had other things to do.  He threw down two pieces of paper and said, these our are specials tonight.   The food was great but the service was very poor.  We did not feel welcomed at all.   Stupid me I gave him 20% tip, oh well I am sure it was for the food.",

    "text": "I find myself coming back to The Porch fairly frequently, and I would say it's mostly due to the outside seating and convenience of its' location in Oakland. However, after a half dozen visits, I've yet to have a meal where I left feeling overly satisfied. Salads, entrees, pizza, and today's visit: brunch, have all been \"OK.\"  Avoid the farm bread as it's really on the level of a bread that should just be brought to the table for free. Drinks are reasonably priced, they'll be more than you might be accustomed to in Oakland, but not significantly more.  Took over 30 minutes for our food to come out today, but the restaurant was busy and it was relaxing sitting outside so it wasn't a big deal in this case.  All-in-all, it's a decent spot for a casual lunch or dinner, but from my experience, don't expect anything to knock your socks off.",

I came again this weekend for brunch and I couldn't have been more satisfied. I got the eggs Benedict, substituting salmon pastrami for the ham. While I felt like the salmon was a bit sparse, the dish was fantastic. The Benedict was topped with a greenish hollandaise sauce that was both unexpected but perfectly paired with the pico garnish. I'm thinking it was an avocado hollandaise.  The potatoes that came with the dish were perfect and the flavored ketchup was an unexpected, and pleasant surprise.   I got a mimosa to go with my brunch and it was average, which was fine.  I loved everything about my two visits here and I look forward to dining again.",

Menu selection was perfect for a Sunday brunch. Our family being of French descent knows quiche so mostly we ordered theirs and were all pleased on its light custard consistency. Coffee lovers too appreciated their brews. Service was excellent as well. We'll be back.",

The ambience is beautiful both the indoor and outdoor seating are really nice and it's a nice place to chill and also party.The food is really good as well. The options for vegetarians are extremely limited in their pizza choices which is a downside if you are a vegetarian. The deserts though are really great, the Tiramisu has got to be one of the best Tiramisu cakes I have had. It has powdered sugar on top and the coffee flavour is nice and strong. It's not too sweet which is a great thing. Also tried the Creme Brulee which was really nice as well and again the custard inside wasn't too sweet but the hard caramelised top gave it an amazing flavour.",

I arrived on a Sunday evening with a group of 10 one hour before closing and the entire staff couldn't have been more friendly and inviting. Our waitress Dawn was so SO kind. I had questions about vegan options on the menu and she happily checked with the kitchen before my entire party arrived. Fortunately, aside from honey, their pizza dough is vegan and our waitress allowed me to customize a pizza without cheese. Our food arrived very timey, piping hot, and she was attentive up until the minute we left. Everyone's meal looked delicious. Pizza was pretty phenomenal, definitely a crowd favorite. The dough was so warm and fresh, thin but not too thin, thicker crust, and the roasted oyster mushrooms were huge and they just loaded them on. I've been craving that pizza ever since I left. Nice family restaurant right on Pitt's campus. Huge outdoor seating section as well. Looking forward to going back!",

I was unprepared for how much I was going to like this place.  The ambiance was fantastic.  I hope next time when I eat there (and I am already planning my return) that I can sit outside while the weather is still warm.  It's in a beautiful part of Oakland, smack in the middle of Pitt territory.   We had a starter of fried calamari which was done to perfection. I had the best veggie burger I think I've ever had. Period.  It was all home made and fresh.  And my beloved had a grilled porch chop that he's still talking about. Everything was fresh and our server was charming and attentive.  I am so happy we stopped in and even happier that we've found a new favorite place.",

I think the beautiful venue is half the reason I visit the Porch. The interior is spacious and sleek, while the outdoor seating area is great for those sunny days and nice nights (they have a fireplace outside!).   The food is great. Been here for dinner and happy hour. Great happy hour deals, and great food for dinner.   I recommend the Duck Legs, Burgers, Bianca Pizza, Crispy Taters and also listen to what specials they have that night, because last time we got their beef shank dish and it was amazing.   People need to stop going to Union Grill and come to the Porch. Similar prices, but WAY better food and ambiance, not to mention service!",

These cheaper restaurants might not have as fancy ingredients as the Porch, but who really cares about fancy ingredients when half the time you just want a nice, quick dinner or a late night bite to eat to satisfy the drunk munchies?   The restaurant is nice, but a little out of place for Oakland... and certainly not worth the price for the level of service that my friend and I received from a certain waiter who mispronounced risotto and took my napkin and plate away while I was still eating-mid-bite.  On the other hand, the food is quite good, just overpriced for the neighborhood. Lol, let's just say that my friend was stunned when he first saw the menu.",

I ordered the veggie burger which was very good and came with delicious fried baby potatoes (I guess their version of fries. The potatoes were probably the best part of the meal!

The Porch's ambiance is young and hip with tall ceilings, garage-door-type walls that open up to let in some air, and big visible pizza ovens.  Sitting down, you're definitely in the middle of it all, but you also have some privacy.  The food was fun, too.  The pizzas were creative but not zany.  The Bianca, for example, had cheese, figs, and truffle oil.  A tasty combination that I haven't seen elsewhere, but that immediately sounded delicious.  And so I ordered--and loved--it.  The pizzas are individual-sized and are served on metal trays.  You get your pizza and then up to a trio of sides--fresh parmesan, super spicy red pepper flakes, and some oregano.  I say \"up to\" because the kitchen only gives you the sides that would taste good on your pizza.  My Bianca did not come with oregano, for example.  The pizzas were all delicious!  I tried the margarita, bianca, and piggy.  The crust was some of the best crust I've ever had--soft and chewy and warm.  I also heard good things about the burger.  The drinks were also creative and tasty.  I had the pineapple sage margarita.  While it was a little sweet (and this is coming from a dessert fanatic), I still enjoyed it.  I also tasted the \"almost\" arnie and the porch pink lemonade and liked them both.",

Caesar salad- good but a little too much anchovy in the dressing  Prime Rib - ordered medium but it came out very well and tough. By the time it came out, I wasn't even hungry anymore.   Filet Mignon- Coworker had the filet mignon cooked medium and it came medium rare, very fatty and stringy. She subbed the chard and potatoes for broccoli and zucchini (which was nice that they let her). It came out with chard anyway. They ultimately brought out spaghetti squash which she said tasted grilled and she didn't like it. I didn't try it.   Overall, we were there almost 2 hours before we got our subpar food. We told the waiter and he offered to get a manager (nice of him). She told us she noticed we had been there way too long and asked for the honest truth, so we gave it to her. She explained that although it was no excuse, there was a very large party of the stakeholders of the corporation that owns the place that the kitchen was catering to. While we got that, it really was no excuse and she kindly offered to cover our meal for the night. That was nice and fair and I did appreciate it. Unfortunately, I was just here on business and will not be back. The people were nice and friendly, but the service was unforgivably slow and the food was totally not worth it. Kudos to the manager for not making us pay for it.",

    "text": "*My review is for brunch only* Slightly surprised to see lower ratings for this place. First off, the interior really makes the experience enjoyable. The Porch has a light and airy look and feel, and I loved all the details such as the cute milk bottles & tea towels. It certainly beats eating in a sticky booth at a greasy spoon. Our waiter was accommodating, fast, and pleasant. An A-plus for overall experience! As for the food, I was pleased that the brunch menu was short and simple with frittatas, chorizo, warm farm bread...all fresh and mouth watering! Add a mimosa and I'm a happy girl. If you want a run of the mill, 100 item menu then perhaps this isn't your place.",

Has the upscale E&P feel similar to 6Penn, but with a fantastic location right at Schenley.  The wife's Chorizo & Eggs was great (the curry ketchup & potatoes were the best part) and my summer bread salad was alright (great marks for uniqueness, but overall it was lacking in the flavor department).  The real star of the show here was a great brunch appetizer special...  a ginormous bunch of cinnamon rolls in a cast iron skillet.  Looking back, I wish I would of just ordered a second round of those!  They do have a limited selection of drafts and cocktails, and I saw a few tables order what looks to be like some pretty tasty pizza.  Not a must-try, but definitely a good place for grub.",

So I have to admit that I didn't give them the chance to fix the steak ... But when you pay top $$$ and get a dish that is elegantly presented... What a downer if parts of it are inedible.

    "text": "I dined at The Porch with a friend today for the first time, Sunday, 1 November at 10:30 a.m.  Our meal was very disappointing.  We were seated at one of the most undesirable tables, a tiny two-table wedged in between  parties on both sides that were inches away from us. Any conversation would have easily been overheard by our close neighbors. Would it not be appropriate for the quick and curt host to to take a moment to say, \"Is this table alright for you, gentlemen?\" rather than to seat us, plop down the menus, and quickly exit?  We requested a spacious booth and were provided one.  I hoped to be able to have a Reuben sandwich which is offered throughout the week, but was informed that the restaurant could not prepare it. The only items available were those on the limited, tiny brunch menu.  The kitchen staff was unable to accommodate a reasonable request.  I ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, $12.  The menu does not state what types of eggs are included nor did the waiter tell us or ask what type of eggs I would have wanted.  I was disappointed to find that they were poached.  If I owned a restaurant, my server would say, \"The dish is served with poached eggs.  Is that alright, sir?\" or better yet, \"What type of eggs would you like with that, sir\"? Toast was served without butter and when the entrees arrived, we were not asked if there was anything else that we needed, another oversight which would not happen at most fine dining spots.    I ordered taters (fried potato slices), but was brought home fries.  The food was satisfactory and the portions were standard size.  I would have expected a server at a restaurant of this stature to be pleasant, friendly, welcoming, and engaging.  The young man who provided our food, whom I will not embarrass by stating his name, was none of those things nor did he smile.  Apparently this is not one of the Eat 'n Park restaurants that is a place for smiles.  After we had been at the table for just fifty minutes and had paid the check, Nick came over to ask how we were, which it was clear was a signal that he would like us to vacate the table.  Although there were many empty tables, there was a line of customers waiting. We promptly left.  I am not sure that the restaurant recognizes how easy it is for a server to ruin a meal.  We had the impression of a dining establishment which has a staff that sees the customers as cattle to be herded in and out.  I can receive far more gracious service at Golden Corral for an $8.89 breakfast buffet that includes a massive array of quality foods or a spectacular meal at The Original Pancake House for about the same price as The Porch. I am not anxious to return.",

For lunch I had a pizza which was decent, but nothing to write home about. But the service was friendly and courteous at least. For dinner I shared several entrees with my friends which ranged in quality from passable to fair. Unfortunately, desert was just not edible. I ordered the tart with salted caramel sauce on it. Lord have mercy I could even finish it and I adore all things caramel. All I could taste was salt and even when I passed it on to my human food disposal friend no one could stomach the salt content. All in all. The best thing about this restaurant are the friendly servers. A rather distant second is the pizza. Just way too overpriced for the quality of food.",

This would have been a perfect spot for brunch, get togethers, and more. With that being said, it was a good experience. The only thing that I did not like was the seating arrangements. Opting to sit outside, my two friends and I were placed at a very high table with a very small amount of table space. The pizza that was ordered took up half the table! And there were other outdoor tables available, so this is my only complaint. The rest of our brunch made up for the poor seating arrangements. The wait staff was courteous and very attentive, so I got to have three refills of coffee, which I'm sure my friends appreciated... :) We ordered two breakfast varieties and a pizza, which were all very tasty. My favorite thing to taste was the curry ketchup! Apparently everything is made in-house, too, so the chefs in the back must know what they're doing! The prices are great, too. But I always forget how affordable Pittsburgh is! I miss it.  Did I mention the location of this place? You are in the heart of Oakland and right next to Schenley. It's like you are supposed to take a nice stroll after lunch.",

Also sampled the Pineapple Sage Margarita, refreshing and different.  Me:  Kimchi... nicely spiced Asian slaw, loved it.  And Panzanella Salad.  Salad?  Well, um, BREAD SALAD - Couldn't help it!  Goat cheese, basil and pickled onions over a bed of bread chunks with watermelon vinaigrette.  Extremely filling.  Extremely tasty.  And white anchovies throughout.  Perfection.  Friend:  Corn Bread, yum! --I snatched a sample-- and the prime rib sandwich - which was declared fabulous - I can only vouch for it's high marks in curb appeal.  Service was happy, helpful (except for having no idea what was in the Sangria, bummer) and attentive.  Pricing was pretty pricey, but didn't tip the value scale.  There were plenty of outdoor tables and an outdoor fireplace, but mother nature decided that indoors was the way to go this visit...  Next time outdoors for sure!",

Let me say this: I love the overall look of the place. It doesn't feel like a typical restaurant you'd find in the city. It's hard for me to put a nail on the overall look of the place, but it's nice. It has a nice and comfortable theme to it. Nothing is overly done. It's stylized without being overly dramatic.  The pizza I ordered was amazing. Actually the pizza's we ordered were both amazing. I'm not always a big fan of thin crust pizza because I'm kind of a pig and like my carbs, but this was pretty darn stellar. I loved the presentation and how the different spices/cheese were laid out for you.  My biggest grip was the service. It was truly horrible. My biggest gripe about places is when the service is good only after the check has arrived. Did you forget that there was about 40 minutes prior when you were supposed to take care of me? We had other servers coming to us because they saw the lack of service being provided, which I'll say is very nice, but that's not their job.   Would I go back? Yes. Would I ask for a new server if I got the same one as before? Most definitely.",

    "text": "Used to love The Porch. We came here at least once a month, but they have gone downhill recently. Last month, when I came here, I ordered a Coconut Sorbet for dessert and was given these chunks that looked like a cross between chalk and plaster. It was nothing like ice cream or sorbet at all.   I was also very disappointed by my visit last night. My wife, Deborah, and I had been planning this date night for nearly a month in advance. We got our babysitter to take care of our seven year old son, and we went to catch a movie before heading over to one of our old favorites, The Porch. We arrived just after 9, which was perfect for their half-off pizza. Everything was nice when we first got in, it wasn't too crowded so we were able to be seated right away. They brought us menus and our water pretty quickly, and I ordered the Bianca and Deb got the classic Margherita pizza. If only they had some half-off Margaritas to go along, ha ha...the pizza came out in a pretty timely manner, a little longer than usual, but it was fine. As I began cutting my pizza, though, I noticed that the cheese was very tough. Before I even finished cutting my first slice, the waiter came over and asked if we wanted just one check or separate checks. I had just gotten the pizza for about a minute, and they already had the nerve to ask about the check? Let me at least take a bite first! Maybe our waiter was new, but he was pretty unprofessional. I told him that we were not ready for the check yet, and he just walked away. Finally, after cutting for a long time, I got my first slice of pizza, and there was cheese oozing everywhere. Their pizza has never been like this before, there was just so much cheese and oil from the cheese. Deb also complained about her Margherita being too cheesy, and she almost never complains about anything.  Then, as we were finishing up, our waiter came over and asked Deb if she wanted a box for the rest of her pizza. She said yes, and he left to ask the same thing to other tables. Our waiter came back about five minutes later without a box, but with our checks. Deb and I had planned on getting a dessert to share, but at this point, I was too furious to deal with the waiter so I just paid for the meal. The waiter took about 10 minutes to return the check, and he still had not come out with a box, so we waited another 5+ minutes for that. I don't know if it was because it was late, but I was pretty displeased with the service we received at The Porch. I've been here at later times than this, and received better service.",

If it wasn't for the food being tasty, I'd be giving a 2 star review. My friend and I came here last night (Thursday) around 9:30. It was relatively crowded since they have half price pizza 9-11pm Monday- Thursday. The hostess spent at least 5 minutes looking around, seemingly confused, before she turned to us and said, \"I'll wipe off this table. Give me one minute.\" We opted to sit at the bar instead since there was only one other patron there when we sat down. The bartender greeted us quickly and took our drink orders-Yuengling for him and the Porch pink lemonade (Limoncello, Fresh Squeezed Lemonade, Raspberry) for me. This was where our efficient service ended. She took at least 10 minutes to make my drink, although she did pour his beer quickly. My drink tasted like it had 0 alcohol in it and for $8, I should at least be able to taste a hint of something. I gulped that down quickly while the bartender stood at the other end of the bar engaged in conversation with a fellow employee. We were clearly ready to order (and I clearly had an empty glass in front of me) and after 10 minutes of her ignoring us, we finally were able to, literally, flag her down to order. I also ordered a glass of pinot grigio which she brought a full 10 minutes later. We chose to start with the grilled eggplant appetizer and split the bianca pizza. Someone other than the bartender brought out both the eggplant, the pizza, and silverware, as well as plates. The eggplant was four pieces grilled served with a honey like sauce. It was really tasty, particularly the drizzled sauce on top of it. Shortly after the appetizer, the pizza came out. The bianca, while not as good as Enrico's Fig Jam pizza, was still delicious in its own right. I wish the crust had been cooked through a bit more, it was a tad doughy but the actual flavors of the goat cheese and fig jam were superb! This pie was also the perfect size to share with someone-we weren't overly stuffed, just satisfied.  Now back to service, not once did the bartender as how everything was tasting, we had to, again, flag her down and pull her away from her deep conversation with her coworker in order to get additional drinks halfway through our meal, and while we didn't have to ask for our check, we did have to ask her to run the credit card, after she walked by it sitting on the bar at least 6 times (yes, we were pretty irritated and counted). As a former server, I was highly disappointed with the service we received last night. I always tip over 20% and I could hardly justify leaving her even 15% because she brought nothing except our drinks and acted like we were bothering her everytime we needed something, and we are very easy to please diners. I think I'd still at least give it one more try, only because the food was good, however, I will sit at a table and see if service is any better. Hopefully it will be.",

It was pretty good. I would've liked more sage and pineapple flavor, but a very unique combination nonetheless. My friend got the whiskey sour. A solid choice.   Good service - I liked that when I asked for water, the server brought me two jugs of water. Wish all places did that. The ambiance is great, and I definitely plan to be back for food some time. Really close to CMU and Pitt. Would be a nice date place ;)",

    "text": "The Porch is a great find. We always ride by and noticed they are busy. So on a trip to Phipps we decided to give it a try. Drinks -Pineapple Mango Margarita (tart but good) and Strawberry Mojito( sweet left me wanting another) We decided to split a harvest salad and a piggy pizza. To our delight we loved both. We noticed just about every table has a pizza. They are a 6 count and for most people can  easily share. We should have got the calamari as an appetizer too but was afraid it was going to be too much. The table next to us got that and the cornbread and it looked yummy. We saw the cheese meat appetizer too that looked great for a lunch or as an appetizer for a large group. The soups were a nice size. The lady next to me got fried green tomatoes and seemed to be enjoying them. Her husband said they should come more frequently because they go elsewhere pay more and never are as happy as they are at the Porch.  We had an apple dessert and a Tiramisu ( we could have split it I only ate half) that was delicious and rich. We saw couples on dates, groups, and parents visiting their college students. Outside on the patio is a fireplace and had it been a tad warmer or if we were dressed warmer we would have ate out there for the ambiance. I checked the fireplace out and it really is just for looks not giving off much heat.  So when in Oakland do your tummy a favor and stop in for some fresh delicious food at the Porch. Then go to the Museum or Phipps.",

    "text": "So I have been to this place a few times, and while I have never been wowed, but they do a lot of things right, so I always come back.  This most recent trip though, was truly awful.  I came in on that weird bubble between lunch and dinner, while they were breaking everything down from lunch service, but they were still serving lunch menu.  We went up to the counter to order, which already turned me off.  for 12 dollars a salad, I think they should have a server take my order, and check up on me to see if I enjoyed it.  I ordered a chop salad, and farm bread (the farm bread has been something I've enjoyed greatly on my previous visits), while my friend ordered the fig and goat cheese pizza.  They also offered serve yourself \"agua frescas\"  which was nothing more than water with whole chunks of fruit in it.  The water had very little flavor, just enough to sour the taste of the water, without even giving you the citrusy notes of squeezing a lemon in your water.  Decent idea, terrible execution.  So my food comes about 10 minutes before hers (just another terrible part of the counter service lunch format.)  The salad...was ok.  So much cucumber, very little everything else, but it was ok if you didn't take the price into account.  I dug into my farm bread, which I was having a hankerin for, and was greatly looking forward to, and.......failure.  The honey butter was runny, and starting to clot, like it was pre-portioned and left out of the cooler.  The jam and apple butter was alright, but the biggest fail, was the bread.  It was doughy, had no airiness about it, just one solid, spongy hunk of bread.  To top it off, it look like they grilled it around the edges, which left a horrible, gross perimeter on an already shoddy product.  So how does one say anything about a terrible meal during lunch?  Should I go back up to the counter and tell them I spent 20 bucks on burnt bread, room temperature butter, and a bar quality salad?  Does anyone care?  No, because there is no server, and there is no manager checking the quality of the food being put out.   TL; DR:  Shame on you, Porch, shame.  Step your game up, you're already mediocre quality is falling, which is making it less and less worth the steep price you charge.",

It doesn't matter what season it is, there's something really special about sitting inside looking out at the Cathedral.  On the other hand... the foot is sometimes good and sometimes bad. The \"Porch\" sandwich is great, but I've had the pizza and felt sick afterwards both times (this doesn't happen with other pizza, just FYI). Some of the other more expensive entrees I don't think are worth it- there are a million other restaurants that give you better tasting food. The Porch's cheap, underlying origins really show with these \"nicer\" entrees.  The beer selection is alright, but for what they're charging they should have a better selection of craft brews. The other liquor is alright, but not great   I'm amazed they charge for what is essentially stale bread with some butter. Kind of odd since that should be included by default.  I never object to going here with a friend, but it usually isn't my first choice either.",

The dishes I love here are Rocket salad and the Porch burger..anyway, what I don't like about the food here is that I will be very thirsty after the meal..(may be too much MSG in the food?)",

    "text": "What a crowd!  We got to the Porch and the place was packed!  All of the outside were filled and as we walked inside, it was packed also.  I suppose,  that was expected as this place sits right on the middle of University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.  Also, today is the last day of school and graduation to add.  Overload of parents and siblings!  So, back to the topic of the Porch.  Although,  it was packed,  we did not have to wait long to be seated.  The servers were very quick and brought a round of water for everyone.  We ordered some Calamari to start and at $9 dollars, it is not a bad price.  Once the rest of the drinks were brought, we've ordered our entrees.  Even though, it was crowded, the Calamari came out pretty quick.  The presentation looked ok and I thought the portion was large.  I suppose, that's what I get for thinking.  As we dug in, I noticed there were only few small body parts and only four (4) small leg part.  These were obviously from babies.  Rest were full of bell peppers.  It was also very salty.  Yes, I had to tell the server how disappointed we were and that this has to be the worst Calamari we have ever had.  Well, soon after that, our entrees came out.  These were not bad and my burger was fairly juicy and tasty.  Ok, the price for most of the items were pretty over priced in my opinion.  As a constantly traveler and eating at many different restaurants, they could stand to lower the prices.  After all, they are surrounded with the college students and I don't think most of them could afford their prices.  Needless to say, the service and the entrees got me to give them 3 stars.    Would I recommend here?  I suppose, if you are desperate for a fairly nice sit down place, then, yes.  Otherwise, I would look for another place.",

Overall, a pretty good experience and I may come back in the future during the remainder of my time in PGH.  There's metered street parking along Forbes Ave. I went during the late lunch on a weekday. It was pretty tame and quiet in there, if not basically empty. They sell coffee for $1 before 11am, too!",

It sits in this nice place of either stopping for a casual bite, wearing whatever or dressing up nice for an evening out with your date. The prices also reflect that unique dualism with plates ranging from $10-$15 and from $25-$30.   There's a rumor around town that they grow their own produce on the roof. Is it True? Who knows and who cares. It's delicious either way. But that would be sweet.   The servers are great. I have never had a bad server at this restaurant. They are always speedy, helpful, and attentive. I also like how water is left on the table because I'm basically a camel when I go out to eat.   As far as food is concerned . . . Their pizzas are good but not out of the world good. BUT Monday-Thursday they are half off from 9pm-11pm. That's a killer deal and worth taking advantage.   My recommendations for food? Get an appetizer. Get the cornbread. My wife and I love it. I can't explain it. It's just so good. It's sweet and delicious. I also recommend the Porch Burger. It really is delicious, and the potatoes that accompany it are just perfect. The ketchup isn't Heinz (relax) but it has this kind of spice to it that makes it just so unique and worth your time to experience.   Outside seating on a nice day adds to the great experience if you want a quick drink and appetizer.   The Porch is that restaurant you pass all the time and don't realize how great it actually is. I suggest you get there asap!",

The sandwich was huge and there were many veggies inside, making it a very filling and satisfying breakfast. The coffee was really nice as well especially for the $1 price.  Went during half off and ordered the Bianca pizza (savory fig jam, goat cheese, truffle oil and arugula). It's a very good vegetarian option. Could use more cheese, but very good especially for the price.  For dessert I got the seasonal cookies and cream cheesecake, it was delicious. The cheesecake was rich and creamy. Definitely a great option for sharing.  I give this place 3 stars because while the ingredients are fresh, I do think it is a bit overpriced for what you are getting.",

Definitely a more \"decent\" place but as Laura M. pointed out, that's just not that difficult to do in Oakland. We frequently come here, specifically when we have work-related meetings etc, because it is a nice place with some more decent food. Now, it is always packed and the wait staff is usually quite friendly and quick, but the food usually leaves me feeling meh...  I do like the fact that their pizza is half price after 9pm, but I have had way better ones. I have tried burgers, salads and the salumi platter and it's just nothing to write home about and generally I find the food over-priced for what you actually get.   But given their monopoly in the Oakland area, I am sure I will visit again and who knows, maybe one day this place will grow on me.",

    "text": "So this place has been on my list of places to try for quite some time now but I have to say I'm not blown away. Let's start with what I loved about the place. Cute place, right in the heart of Oakland near the park. The waiter was very friendly and the service was so quick. We were probably in and out within 45 minutes top.  Now here's what I don't like, which really isn't much. The only real complaints I have is around the dish in particular that I got. Eggs benedict is one of my absolute favorite breakfast dishes after huevos rancheros so I will say I am a little bit snobby at times when it comes to my eggs benedict. I think the hollandaise sauce was lacking a little something. I couldn't put my finger on it but it was missing something that would have given it a little more flavor. I also wasn't really pleased with the lack of smoked salmon. I honestly felt like I had maybe 3 bites out of the entire thing that had salmon on it. Which I probably wouldn't have minded if I hadn't ordered the most expensive meal off the menu. Most of the other menu items were around $8-10 I would probably say but mine was $14. At the time I thought that was reasonable given it had salmon on it but after I saw how little salmon was on it I felt that was a little unreasonable. One of the things I loved about the dish was the ketchup and potatoes on the side. It wasn't your average Heinz ketchup, they added something to it that gave it great flavor. Tasted almost like a ketchup my family used to get over in Germany.   I realize a lot of my negatives aren't a huge deal so I think a 3 star review is still fair. I would still recommend people go check it out and I will probably be back at some point to try something else as well.",

Much better choice as far as being able to hear people. The good seemed to take forever. Still ordered the burger but got the potatoes this time. Yummy!!!! My husband has the chicken sandwich.

The Porch Burger was pretty good, though toooo much sauce.  The Prime Rib Sandwich had some sort of vinegary something-or-other that overwhelmed all the other tastes.(Supposedly there was some Gorgonzola on it but there was no way to know) The most disappointing part was the \"Crispy Taters\".

    "text": "If I could rate only the pizzas, I'd give it 4 stars! However, the Porch is extremely overpriced. I only go for the late night Hal off menu which is beyond worth it, but everything else is super overpriced, especially for Oakland. I get that they wanna have a slightly upscale vibe and they do have an interesting menu, but some things are just unnecessarily priced. I've had some of the things on the menu that aren't the pizza and it's nothing spectacular. They change their menu often but the Bianca pizza is a great staple that (as far as I know) doesn't seem to leave their menu. I'd definitely recommend for late night half off pizzas on Monday-Thursday!",

    "text": "As a family of four, overall we had 2 great dishes, and 2 sub-par dishes. Friendly service and fair prices though. Read on to learn.  One vegan, and three omnivores walk in to The Porch. They sit down, drink 4 milk jugs of water, and order some food. Ambiance was great outside, so a great place for a drink on a cool summer night.   We ordered the tofu and vegetable soup (a special that night), the ratatouille pizza, the veggie burger, and the patio burger, and an appetizer of sweet potato fries.  Sweet potato fries were good, crispy and fresh. Just a small amount.  Veggie Tofu Soup was fantastic, a great summer special.  Ratatouille Pizza was very good as well, great portion size and presented very well (see picture). The all star of the night.  Veggie Burger was a miss. The burger itself was fantastic (edamame, black beans, corn, curry powder, etc) salted and peppered. Topped with arugula and brown olives and shaved fennel. The olives were certainly a unique addition, not for all eaters. The bun wasn't vegan, but the farm bread was, so i had that as my bun. Overall the burger was okay, the bread was certainly dry though and i had to pick out the olives. They didn't make sense for my palate.  Patio Burger was an average burger, nothing to write home about.  Last bit of critique: the \"tater tots\" included with the burgers were whole russet potatoes...a bit odd and not fitting the description. Not a bad thing, just different.  Overall, an average restaurant. Can absolutely improve in some areas, but seems to be a hot spot in town, and close to Pitt and CM.",

Server didn't tell our table of 4 any of the daily specials and came to our table outside about 3 times; one to take our order, another to bring our food, and then to bring us our check.  Most of the time we had to ask other servers for water, to bring us our check, to get us condiments.  Sad to say, we may have gotten the bad apple of the bunch that day.    We sat outside and enjoyed the views of people enjoying themselves on the park while we waited... Waited for our server, waited for water, waited for our food, and waited for our change (which never came until we started getting up).  Once we got our food I thought it would be super delicious because my stomach was literally eating itself but alas, high expectations fell a bit short.   Aside from our own entrees, we did get a side of the bacon and it resembles chopped up pork belly rather than breakfast bacon strips so be ready for the little caste iron pan with hunks of pork swimming in its own fat :) take that however you want.  Would go back for a loooong meal to enjoy the weather but not if I didn't have patience or was on a 1.5 hour time crunch.",

I like their Sunday brunch and lunch menus(not sure if they even open for dinner), but food can be hit or miss. Sometimes I really liked their food, sometimes they were meh. Staff service varies. Sometimes, they are really helpful. Another time, I'm sure my server was having a bad day, because the sturdy-built guy couldn't care less about customer requests or needs. Be careful when sitting outside, especially under a tree. The table seated next to us had a bird dropping fall on their place - which prompted us to move under the roof as well.",

I've looked at their non-pizza menu and it's a bit pricey, but from what other people tell me, the other food is great.   The pizza is more than large enough to feed one person, but my friends and I usually split a couple between us so we can have different flavors. My favorites is the Piggie Pie, but I also had another seasonal pizza with goat cheese and fig on it, which was also extremely good! The crust is nice and crunchy on the outside, but soft enough on the inside, and the ratio of sauce-to-crust is perfect.   Overall, this is a fabulous spot to come to if you're a student in Oakland looking for a late-night snack, or a non-student who wants a classier spot to eat at in Oakland. Will be back again!",

Unfortunately, the Porch doesn't have an abundance of options for gluten-free eaters, but I found enough: brussel sprouts and bacon (THE best, I could have ordered another); pumpkin risotto (decent); and a garden harvest salad (the goat cheese was some of the best I've ever had). I sat alone and watched the cooks and runners do their thing, and this place works FAST. My waiter was incredibly friendly and made me feel like I had known him for years! He was so nice. The ONLY thing is that it's a little pricey for my taste. I got those three things (above), and I had a $42 bill, including the tip. No alcohol or beverage other than water. That's a little steep for me. Otherwise, I think I'll head back here again if I'm ever pulling another stint at Pitt's library!",

Cornbread...its sweet, it's savory, crunchy and soft all in one.  Cons: Pricing. I think the food is good...not great, just good therefore I think it's just a bit overpriced. Drinks are way overpriced.  The In-between: Happy Hour. Last I was at happy hour here (which was quite some time ago) the specials were only at the bar area. This is my gripe at all places that do that. At least continue it to the nearby tables. Chances are I'm coming with a group. If I'm getting a happy hour priced drink, I'm more than likely going to spend a little more in food. So while the deal is good, 15 people at the bar is not enough space.  I will say at my most recent visit, the service was outstanding.",

Served with their mustard and beer cheese, these fried soft pretzels I will be day dreaming about in days to come! Next we shared the Bianca pizza. This was delicious too! I've had similar pizzas to this, but the fig jam took this to another level. I enjoyed a glass of their white sangria which was nice and refreshing but nothing spectacular. Our service was prompt and enjoyable and the ambiance is nice yet casual which is my favorite! Enjoy!",

    "text": "I spend a lot of time in Oakland and the Porch is usually a solid dining option for both dinner and lunch.  The Bianca pizza is amazing! We've started ordering it to-go after we've already eaten our dinners so that we can have it for another day.  Pretty much everything under the \"this & that\" category on the menu is perfect for snacking while drinking.  Also, our food is always ready super fast! My only kind of complaint is that the service has usually just been \"okay.\"  The staff has always been pleasant and knowledgeable of the menu, but they have taken a while to first come over to the table to take our order and bring our check (also bring it back which made my boyfriend nervous because they had his card).",

    "text": "So let me say that I have driven past many many times, longing to enter.  I've made excuses like... \"Do I really want to deal with street parking today?\"  etc.  Well, I finally had the opportunity and went.  It is kind of cute.  You enter, order/ pay at the register and then pick a table and claim it with the numbered sign you were given.   To start I was in the group setting many of whom had just met me.  Let me just say this is a mini celiac nightmare (at least for me), mostly because you have probably gotten roped into going somewhere that you know nothing about.  Well, I got lucky this time.  I asked the individual behind the register and he informed me that most of the salads were fine and he seemed knowledgeable.  I ordered a chopped salad sans dressing just in case.  It was wonderful with moist, flavorful pulled chicken.  It was a nice light lunch with no contamination issues.  The waiters were friendly and made a point of loudly announcing my \"gluten free allergy\" chopped salad's arrival. As I surveyed my colleagues meals I have to say that everyone finished their plate and stopped short of licking the plate clean.  Also the tiramisu appeared rather enjoyable. The only mini negatives.... well at lunch time it can get pretty tight and the waiters often have to skirt the edges of the tables to get to other tables with orders.  I was mildly concerned for a second that i was going to have someones dish raining down upon me at some point.  However, the waiter appeared accustomed to this and his balance was on point.   Overall nice experience and I didn't get sick.  No complaints.  I'd be tempted to go again, maybe next time in a smaller group so I could spend more time asking about the menu to see if options other than salad exist.",

Service was quick, though our waiter mentioned something about barely waking up in time to get to work. The food was good but not particularly memorable - we had the porch scramble and an apple pancake meal. The potatoes that came with my eggs were very tasty, but there were only 3-4 bite-sized or bigger potato morsels, which disappointed as I could have eaten quite a few more.   Overall, a \"high side of average\" meal.",

    "text": "I kind of agree with the 3  1/2 stars this place gets. Not bad, but certainly not great. The service was the same. They didn't ignore us, nor did they dote.   I had the porch burger, which is topped with pulled pork or beef or something. Because they rely on the saucy meat, there isn't any traditional condiments and I felt it was a little dry. However the flavor was good, and it was cooked as I ordered it, something a lot of places can't do. It is served with 'crispy potatoes'; basically really well done tiny potatoes, which I liked. A lot of the items seem to have superfulous ingredients for the sake of being fancy, and I'm not so into that.  My BF had the ravioli appetizer. At least I think it was an app.-it certainly wasn't an entree portion. The heading is 'this and that'. I mention that because I found the menu strange and disjointed. I know that sounds completely ridiculous but it made it harder for me to order. I didn't want to end up with two meals or three raviolis to eat.  Anyway, my BF thinks they were fried, but I think they were baked. They didn't seem to have that oiliness about them. It was ok; like I said, 3.5 stars.   Our friend had a huge piece of meat; I think a rib-eye maybe? He just loved it!, although Todd is the nicest person on the planet and doesn't ever have a bad word to say about anything or anyone, so...ya know.   As a side note, if you have never even seen the place, it is in the middle of what used to be Schenley Plaza, and has some kick-ass outside seating.",

And there comes the perfect eggs benedict from the porch, right before I felt hopeless for EBs in burgh.  They use their homemade ham, which is a little bit different from Canadian ham you used to have, but it is a great match for their perfect creamy poached eggs. I haven't had such perfect poached eggs for a long while,  for even in some fancy brunch places claimed they have legendary eggs benedicts in NYC.  Also the side dish, toasted potato with their sauce,  is exceptional too. Can't love the whole dish any more.  My boyfriend ordered a smoke salmon, which is decent, but I am most impassive with the eggs benedict!",

A couple of friends and I decided to take advantage of their 1/2 off pizza and asked to be seated outside. Very pleasant experience being able to sit out in the open with a great view of Schenley Plaza!   On to the pizza! It was pretty okay...we decided on 2 different types of pizza, but ended up with 3 since the waiter accidentally misheard our order and gave us a wrong pizza. Thankfully he was nice about it and didn't include it in our bill. Here's my personal breakdown of the pizzas we ordered:  BBQ Chicken: It was difficult to taste the actual pizza because there was just SO MUCH BBQ sauce...it made it very difficult to eat in addition to there being a very scant amount of chicken.  Shrimp & Zucchini: I found this pizza to be quite bland. I could barely taste the shrimp or the zucchini toppings, however, the roasted red pepper was actually really tasty!  Asparagus Tocino: This one was probably my favorite one. Not too saucy and had the right amount of toppings. Asparagus was cooked perfectly and tasted great!  Bottom Line: I find The Porch to just be an okay place to eat, but I do find the waitstaff to be very nice and accommodating. Also, a lovely place to just sit out and hang out with a group of friends, particularly on summer evenings!",

I guess because it is all local.  Their menu changes and in my opinion, they should master making their menu good consistently before changing it up.  I ordered the vegetable salad ($11) with pulled chicken on top (+$4).  Also tried their egg nog with spiced rum special ($8).  The salad was tiny and boring and I hated the mushrooms on it.  The eggnog was good.  Our waitress was such a sweetheart and took really great care of us so no complaints on service or atmosphere.  But I don't know. Maybe just not my style, and this is just my opinion -- but I could think of so many other places I would rather go for a meal than this place.",

The pizza is plated on parchment paper atop a large metal tray with small piles of parmesan, oregano, and red pepper flakes on the side. My boyfriend got the BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple, jalapenos, and cilantro. Both of the pizzas were pretty solid but not really worth raving about. We also got the calamari for an appetizer, which was good with the spicy tomato sauce, but I felt that they weren't fried properly since the coatings were a bit soggy.

It's within walking distance to home, it has awesome outdoor seating and it's slightly more upscale than most of the Oakland restaurant.  However, I can't like it.  I just can't.  The menu lacks variety and what they do have is overpriced and overcomplicated.  They seem to be having a bit of an identity crises in that you pour your own water out of a glass milk bottle and use tea towels as napkins, but pay $19 for a tiny piece of salmon.  Are we \"country\" or \"upscale?\"  I'm still trying to figure that out.  Also, the happy hour is decent, but you are only allowed to enjoy it if you are seated in the bar.  That might be ok if the restaurant didn't have an open floor plan.  I've eaten there and have literally paid twice as much for the same drink as the person sitting within an arm's length of me.  God forbid you try to order a drink at the bar and take it back to your table!  The pizzas are ok if you're buying them during dinner or lunch.  If you're there for their night time 1/2 priced pizzas, the quality goes down significantly.  So far I've been here half a dozen times and each time, I'm left feeling disappointed and that I paid way too much for what I got.  Unless things improve, I won't be going back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I came here last year and wanted to write a review as an attest to the quality and a reminder so I never forget where it is. I stopped by with family because I was visiting my brother at the nearby university when we dropped by here. I believe I had a pizza with arugula and fig jam? I'm always about Chicago-style pizza so coming east is always a bit out of my pizza comfort zone, but this was okay. I was more reminded of California style pizzas with heavy experimentation especially seeing as truffle oil + fig jam on a pizza would get you crucified in Chicago. But to me the star was the cheesecake. It was a vanilla bean cheesecake that I truly didn't expect to be much. Rarely do you find a restaurant with cheesecake that knocks you off your feet but the cheesecake here was the best I've EVER had. It was incredible. My first bite left me stunned and my jaw literally dropped. This lead to my family mocking me but wow was their cheesecake good. I want to come back to Pittsburgh just for this cheesecake alone. I have to pick up a full cake. It has to happen.",

    "text": "What a great new spot to get some lunch.    First, and foremost, this place has an excellent atmosphere.  Defiantly one of the trendiest little spots in Oakland.  I took my sister out to lunch here, and I left feeling in love with the place.  I really cannot describe the coolness of this place in words, so I am going to stop trying.    The food.  Very, very good.  I got a salad, and my sister got a turkey sandwich.  Both were very yummy.  This place is a little pricey, but I guess they have to pay for the cool atmosphere somehow.  Like I said, food was very good.  My salad had candied pecans, vegetables, and yummy goat cheese.  I finished that plate off real quick.  My sister's picture perfect turkey sandwich, which came with field greens, disappeared rather quickly.  It had capers and this cranberry sauce on it.  It was very different and very good.   I defiantly would recommend this place for lunch.  I want to go back and try their pizzas, so if anyone's looking to go, I will drive ;).  They also look like they have an actual \"sit-down\" dinner menu that looks pretty appetizing.  Like I said, pick me up, and we will make a night out of it.",

    "text": "Visiting from Florida we stopped in for lunch on Labor Day and were impressed by the inside atmosphere and vibe and the cool outside porch/deck area. The atmosphere really sells the place and the food is good too.  The line was quickly amassing so we ordered fast - a grilled cheese and crispy taters (order these. Do not share them!) and a roasted vegetable salad and scoop of blood orange gelato for me. As we sat down and waited for our food we noticed several people eating pizza. It looked and smelled delicious. So we went back up and ordered a pizza.  My salad was okay. The dressing wasn't overly flavorful. His grilled cheese was good. The potatoes -- oh, the potatoes. Round potatoes that were uber crisp on the outside and velvety on the inside were served with a bit of fresh rosemary and a cup of chipotle ketchup. Thumbs up.  Gelato was okay. The pizza was good but the meat was a bit salty. It comes with a trio of oregano, red pepper flakes and freshly grated cheese for you to sprinkle at your own leisure.  Good experience. Fantastic spot with tons of windows.",

    "text": "Love going to this place when it is nice out! I always customize a pizza with bacon and a sunny side egg and it is excellent every time. My friend has tried some of their entrees and their salads and has never been disappointed. I love that they have so much available outdoor seating, and it's great people watching during the day when all the University of Pittsburgh students are milling about.",

    "text": "I randomly stopped in here after visiting the Museum of Natural History.   I came right after brunch ended and before dinner so the menu was limited.   I ordered the baba ganoush and a salad, I don't remember the name. The baba ganoush is served with lentil chips and pickled vegetables(more one this later); and it was really good.   The salad I ordered had walnuts beets and carrots and was tossed in a vinaigrette dressing with some sort of creamy cheese.  It was not what I expected but very good none the less.  I do not understand this place's obsession with pickled vegetables. They are everywhere on the menu.  I tried them as they came with my baba ganoush, but they were pretty bad.  Great place to people watch.  It was the CMU graduation so  it was really interesting to see all the people from all over the world.",
