I am impressed with beer selections for a micro brewery! The place is spacious (think mass church duh). Parking is accessible in the rear and the service was solid!",

I enjoyed the play on the concept of having the brewing tanks at the altar, which contributes to the fact that they consider beer to be truly the most important part of this place. I had a Belgian style beer which has a slightly higher alcohol percent (11%) but it was absolutely delicious! Our server was very good with describing what the beers tasted like for us (I am not the kind of person that justGETS it from the name, but I don't like very hippy tasting beers). The Trippel was also delicious. Couldn't get to the chocolate vodka cocktail but that sounded heavenly. Food was great, they do a great job with the perougies so that is worth trying for sure. Their portobello pesto pizza was brilliantly made!! Thank you wood-fired oven!",

    "text": "This is the most unique brewpub I've ever seen.  I mean, it's a church with a brew house where the altar used to be.  Wow.  To say that it feels borderline transgressive is putting it mildly.  But then you remember monks have been making beer for centuries and any guilt transubstantiates to awesome.  Because the room is really cool and the beer quite simply rocks.    I decided to order a flight and it's one of the best decisions I've made in a church.  I'd enjoyed the Dunkel the night before at Fridays at The Frick, so I knew I'd like it in all its malty German goodness, but the other beers did not disappoint.  The table favorites were Pipe Organ Pale, the Porter, the Strong Ale and the Mad Mardigan's, with its spicy black malt.  Yum.  Oh, it's pretty loud, the food is decent (good lamb meatballs and hummus) and as others have said, the service could use a little improvement.",

    "text": "I was really excited to go to Church Brew Works.  However, the major issue is the management.  We went on a Saturday night and it was packed.  All of the waitstaff were working their asses off.  But the troubling thing was, they had at least 5 hosts/hostesses sitting up front on their phones.  As a former waitress and even just as a customer, I was offended.  There is no reason they should be that overstaffed with hosts/hostesses doing the job of one person.  A good manager would have these excess personnel refilling water glasses (mine was empty for a large portion of the evening) or clearing tables.    The food was good, especially the bison meatloaf and the beer flights were huge.  I was just really troubled by the dichotomy between the waitstaff juggling at least 10 tables of large groups and the hostesses literally doing nothing.",

Our waitress seemed a bit flighty/distracted and we thought it was due to the crowd but found out later that we were only one of two tables she had so not sure why she was struggling.    It took a while for beers to be replenished and in one incident she said that they were replacing the tap for the IPA and when we followed-up with her about it when no beer arrived 15 minutes later, she said she would ask but then stopped herself and said that she remembered they ran out...What?!?!  I was thinking to myself at what point where you going to mention that and that's an important detail to remember when there's a table of thirsty individuals waiting for beers.  Needless to say, that's where the night ended.  For food, we ordered the \"featured\" pierogies which had a thousand island dressing with mushroom filling.  It was suprisingly good - I didn't think thousand island dressing on pierogies would be good but it worked.  Also ordered the spinach, feta, gouda dip with the \"oven-fired\" flatbread but was disappointed as the flatbread was cold and didn't seem \"oven-fired\" at all.  The dip was \"meh\" - not that great.  We also ordered the pesto mushroom pizza and four cheese pizza which were very tasty.  More than enough for 5 people to share.",

The menu items don't seem to change much like they used to and the pizza was one of the best menu items and there is still no pizza oven so you can't even get that anymore. I brought my daughter here for our girl night for her birthday just this past weekend and I'd have to say it was the worst experience I've had here.

    "text": "Give us this day, our daily BEER!  A brewery?  In a church?  This is MY kind of religion!  When we walked in, I was surprised by the decor.  They definitely remodeled, but they re-used a lot of original fixtures.  I was too excited to sit in a booth made from old pew benches.  There is no altar at the front of the church.  Brew tanks and other equipment take its place.  The aisle is just that.  An aisle, which divides the restaurant style seating and more casual high-top table bar seating.  We were here on a Saturday afternoon, and the menu showed several different brews.  Unfortunately, they were out of several drafts.  The menu became a little frustrating when we saw that they do sell their beers bottled, but only certain varieties.  They do sell their beers in growlers, but only in certain varieties, some of which they were out of.  So we both started with the Cherry Wheat and ordered a dessert to share (banana bread with peanut butter ice cream).  I really liked this beer, although it was the only one I tried.  We both finished our beers and ordered a second round of drinks.  We asked about our dessert, but the waitress said she thought we said we \"didn't\" want it.  Oops, okay, it'll just be a few minutes.  My Mango Sangria kept me occupied and happy while I waited.  Perhaps the most surprising thing about Church Brew Works is that they have a cocktail menu AND the cocktails are really damn good.  A lot of time passed before we got our dessert.  We had to ask about it at least twice.  Apparently, the kitchen hadn't prepped it for the day yet, and some other chaotic goings on.  The waitress apologized profusely, and then the manager stopped by our table to apologize and inform us that we would not be charged for the dessert.  The service at CBW is great, even if there are snags like low beer inventory and missing desserts.    We did not try anything off of the food menu, but there was a large party at a table nearby that appeared to be really enjoying themselves.  I would definitely visit again if I were in Pittsburgh, and I'd recommend it to all of my beer & travel loving friends.",

    "text": "First timer at The Church Brew Works, and I was disappointed to say the least.  To begin, the building is stunning! Absolutely beautiful! But for some reason, they felt the need to hang tacky, poorly designed flags everywhere which so cheapened the ambiance.  We ordered 3 different types of beer: the Octoberfest, the Oatmeal Stout, and the Brett Ambrosia. The beer menu is confusing and not helpful. The seasonal beers were not described at all, and some of the normal beers had \"if available\" after them. - note that I got the Octoberfest after being told their trippel was not on tap, and my dad chose the oatmeal stout after being told that they were out of the seasonal coconut bourbon stout. You are a brewery, & this is not okay in my book.  The beer was not terrible, but not fantastic. Nothing I would ever order again. The stout was not complex or full bodied at all. The Octoberfest was also fairly bland and forgettable, in my opinion. I'm not a fan of bretts, but you might like it if you are.  The service was terrible. The waitress seemed clueless and awkward. She answered with an \"I don't know,\" more than once with no offer to try to answer questions, had no idea items were unavailable until after we had ordered them, and was incredibly unprofessional. If she was new, I could've looked past this, but she made no mention of being a new hire.  Finalllyyy... The menus and food. The menus are awful. Very poorly designed and so confusing. The pages are falling out and the books are tattered. As far as I'm concerned, if you're charging $20+ for entrees like pasta, this is unacceptable. The choices on the menu had no rhyme or reason. Half were Italian and half were German, with a sprinkle of whatever else.  The food was mediocre. We only got a few small things because it didn't seem worth the money, and the service had us wanting to run out the door. The spinach smoked Gouda dip was okay, but nothing incredibly memorable. The German potato salad was decent, and the soup was alright. Prices were way too high, in my opinion, for what they were serving, especially when they seemed to not be able to get much else right.  Overall, I was sad when leaving. This is such an incredible location with an amazing ambiance, but they killed it for me. Bad service, mediocre beer, and overpriced food made me not care if I ever came back. Wasted potential.",

This last time I was there, the service was so bad that I don't think I'll be going again.  Our group went there on a Saturday at about 4:00 and it was packed. Since we had 7 people, the hostesses suggested we eat at the open bar table, so that's where we sat, which was our biggest mistake. They seemed to have only 2 servers working the bar area. The only time we saw ours, she was running to get to our table, but we never saw her working any others, so I don't know if she was truly busy or just slacking. She apologized a lot, but service never improved, it was just laughably slow. One of my friends took to ripping up the cardboard coasters out of frustration and hunger, another joked about creating a Yelp account just to review the terrible experience.   Our meal took 2 hours and all we got were pizzas, salads, and appetizers. We all had our cards waiting for about 15 minutes by the time our server brought the checks over and we tried to hand them to her immediately, but she ran away while we were calling out \"Wait!\" and \"Here you go!\" It took another 10 minutes for her to come back for them. The dining side of the restaurant seemed to be moving just fine, so some blame for our experience probably lies with the hostesses, who encouraged us to take the hightop at the bar rather than wait for them to pull tables together to fit our party.   The food varies from fine to good, the portions can be small for some of the specialty items (my friend's crab dumplings app was 4 pieces, one without any crab and was $10), the beer is not very good, expect the Dunkel.",

The menu has some really intriguing offerings, and you can tell it was designed by an innovator chef. The dinners I had themselves were somewhat average, and not necessarily executed well. The crag dog appetizer had good flavor but I got significant shells in almost every bite. The jambalaya was also really interesting but the rice has numerous undercooked, crunchy pieces that made it difficult to eat. Honestly, you may be better off going to the pub and getting some of the pretty good bar food items, like a burger. Overall, cool place, decent food, good beer and reasonable prices make this a worthwhile trip to make for people visiting Pittsburgh.",

Much like in churches of the time, you aren't sure where to look because there are so many beautiful features.  The menu is extremely unique with everything from run of the mill pastas to pizzas to alligator pierogies.  And the food we tried was great.  But the prices are quite high for the food you get, especially considering they are double most other brew pub restaurants in the area.  I ordered the pierogi pizza at the recommendation of several Yelpers.  I can see why it was pricey - it was HUGE.  I wish they had size options for the pizzas as this pizza could have easily served three people.  It is a good thing I loved the pizza as I'll be eating it for the next three meals.  My husband had the pasta in peanut sauce and thought it was very tasty.  Again, the portion was HUGE.    We had both ordered appetizers and would not have if we had known the food portions were so large.    The french onion soup was fantastic but the wings were nothing to write home about.  I ordered the peanut sauce version and expected them to be tossed in the sauce.  Instead, I had plain wings with a side of the sauce delivered.  I did dip them, but tossing the wings adds to the flavor because some of it soaks in.  I'm not sure if all of their wings are served this way or just the peanut sauce ones, but it seemed strange.  We were originally hoping to try some dessert, but with the giant portions, we had no room left.  In all, an enjoyable experience with good beer, food and service, but a little to pricey to be more highly recommended.",

    "text": "Despite the disaster that was my break up with my ex last summer, I still keep coming back to the place we first met in person- CBW! I ridiculously love their Thunderhop IPA and it is always my go-to beer if none of the seasonal varieties peak my interest. I'm not a fan of the Celestial Gold but my (new-er) bf, who is not much of a beer drinker and prefers wine or mixed drinks, enjoyed it and said it's \"perfect for non-beer drinkers\". Since I last reviewed any of the menu options, I have sampled a lot, hence the need for an update!  As far as apps go, the Spinach, feta, and smoked gouda dip is  great for sharing and has that oozy, cheesy \"comfort\" taste to it. This is always a winner in my book, particularly because gouda and feta are my two favorite types of cheeses. The chips are, well, just chips. Maybe warmed pita bread would be a tastier substitution to the chips in the future. The bruschetta is also a solid appetizer to share. The ratio of toppings to bread (which usually annoys me when ordering bruschetta because I constantly feel like I'm left with either a lot of topping and no crostinis or the exact opposite) is perfect!  In addition to the wild boar BBQ pizza (which will always be my favorite pie at CBW), I've also had the pleasure of enjoying the Artichoke, spinach, and feta pizza and the chicken and sundried tomato pizza. Both were very flavorful and served pipping hot right out of the oven. The ingredients were very fresh and evenly distributed throughout the pie. The sundried tomato pizza I enjoyed actually was \"on the house\" because the bartender (such a quirky guy but well-meaning) clearly forgot to ring in the order (the big clue was when it had been 25 minutes and he asked what we had ordered again). Being the pizzas here are a bit on the pricey end, I greatly appreciated this generosity particularly considering the inconvenience as well.  I've also had the opportunity to sample some of their sandwiches, and I was pretty impressed with those as well! I've tried the Buffalo burger, the chicken and brie sandwich, and the pulled pork sandwich. The buffalo burger, cooked to a perfect MR, was so flavorful in it's natural juices that I did not use any condiments or have any add ons (like bacon or sauteed mushrooms or onions-perhaps next time since all of a sudden that sounds amazingly delicious!) With the chicken and brie sandwich, I loved how the brie complimented the granny smith apple slices on the sandwich! It was cheesy yet not overly so-very delicious! The pulled pork sandwich was very tasty too-particularly the BBQ sauce which I believe to be the same used on the Wild boar BBQ pizza! And just a general statement on the atmosphere-pretty freakin' awesome! How many people can say they have drank beer in a decommissioned Catholic Church?!

    "text": "I went to the Church Brew Works on May 25th at 9:30 PM.  I wanted to watch the Pens game with a beer. I have never been treated so poorly by a restaurant staff. Right away no one wanted to get a drink for my date and me because it seemed like everyone was cleaning up. If you want to close then don't serve us, but they gave us beers and we took a seat to watch the game. While sitting the manager on site told the wait staff, within ear shot, that it looks like these people will never leave. I can understand wanting to get home, but that's not professional. Then a few moments later this same manager took a panoramic picture of the nearly empty restaurant, my date and me included. I did not want to be in a picture. I was however openly photographed. The wait staff was watching the game, good please do, but why is the manager, who should be setting the example, video tapping the patrons? The entire time we were there, we felt the message that was being sent to us was LEAVE. This is not the first time we have received less than stellar service from a really cool restaurant. What a shame. What a shame that customers aren't more welcome... at a restaurant... Truly disappointed.",

I was surprised and delighted to find the pizza comparable to New Haven's best, honeyed and garlicky with a great crust, and the nontraditional pierogies were outstanding. What a welcome to Pittsburgh! Voted some of the best on my website, Foodette Reviews.",

The food for the price is a little underwhelming other than their Pizza's. They are pretty delicious for the price so I would shoot for that when going here. The beer is pretty good I am a fan of the Pious Monk Dunkle and a few of their other beers.   Last time I was here the order time on the Pizza's were about 45 min - 1 hour so it took a while but I think they were just overly busy that night, so I think I can forgive them for that. The waitress was apologetic and nice so it wasn't a big deal.   Overall I like church brew works. It's a super unique place with good Beer and Pizza. You have to give it a try at least once.",

We asked for samples of beer which your only allowed (2) mmmmmmmmm they have (9) beers on draft but you can only sample (2) we tried a couple and not too impressed with any but settled in the pale ale and then ordered their take on a margherita pizza, it looked like a traditional oven cooked fast food pizza, but it actually tasted worse, so disappointed, looking over the menu it appeared this place has something amazing to offer but they did not. The dough was like eating cardboard, just awful, like frozen pizza that was burnt on your home broiler and then a week old!! This place has ambiance and everything in place to be amazing but someone needs to take control and make that happen. Ordered the Gouda Grits after sending the pizza back. They were chunky and some under cooked areas and made me think they were reheated. Not creamy at all. Flavor was ok tho. My friends ordered a pepperoni pizza. It was drowning in grease.

    "text": "The Church Brew Works is one of those places where everyone has been and everyone raves about...but I just do not get it. I guess part of the reason I don't really dig it is because I'm more of a cocktail gal than a beer fan. Aside from the fact that it is a brewery and I'm not really a beer drinker, the food is only so-so. I got a perogie dish with chicken and my friend got salmon. Her salmon was ok and the same goes for my perogie dish. We shared some homemade chips with a beer/cheese dip before our meal. The chips were really good, but the same as any place that serves homemade chips, and the beer/cheese dip tasted like chicken broth. It lacked anything special. The atmosphere is awesome, and it would be such a cool place for a classic Pittsburgh rehearsal dinner or similar event...but the food is just ... eh. The atmosphere is the only redeeming quality that I can find.   Also, our waitress was (I can't find a nice way to say this...I'm sorry) kind of annoying. She called us both \"Hun\" and \"Sweetheart\" the ENTIRE evening. It felt like those words are a verbal tic of hers...Every other word was Hun or Sweetheart. Her nails had been painted weeks ago...because there was a horrid spot of nearly gone green nail polish on every nail. It only takes a minute to remove nail polish, and when working in an industry that involves putting your hands in front of people it is worth either repainting them, or leaving them clean. The \"I painted my nails a month ago and haven't gotten around to repainting them or removing the polish\" look is NOT ok. Ok...I'm being mean. I'm sorry...but both my friend and I noticed her nails and her verbal tic, and we were both annoyed by both.   All in all, it's somewhere that all Pittsburghers have to go at least once to see the awesome building, but don't have high expectations...it's just ok.",

The biggest problem is that the menu that they had the last time I went (last month) is *the exact same menu they had when they opened.* Everything on there is good, but nothing on there will blow you away--and after you've been there a couple times and it's the same menu over and over again, you realize that this business is trading on the novelty factor, not making any effort to actually be a real restaurant. Very disappointing.",

The food is good, but it is something you do while you drink beer so you don't drink too much, which you may because they really know what they are doing!  However, of all the micro brews or beer taverns in the area, they have the best food.  It is strange to drink and eat at the \"Church\" Brew Works because I am certain my grandmother took me to mass there as a child from time to time.  But I digress...  The beer and staff are great.  If one of the brew masters are there, which they usually are during the day, please ask them for some samples and suggestions.  If you go in the evening it can be a lot of fun.  The bar can be crowded, but the environment is always pleasant.  Sample many different brews and enjoy a nice bite to eat.  Be sure to take a growler home.",

If you order an entree size pierogies, the sauteed ones come in a creamy, Alfredo-type sauce (not my jam, but my group seemed to really enjoy them). We also tried the Spinach/Gouda/Feta appetizer which was good - but again nothing to brag about. I think I'd like this place more just to sit in the pub area with some appetizers and drinks.

Despite the bad beer, I still give it three stars because it was still pretty awesome - the brewery itself, that is. How many church-turned-breweries will you get to visit in your lifetime? Come for the atmosphere but don't get your hopes too high about the brews.  Tip - free parking in their lot around back.",

    "text": "I've been here a handful of time and this place is definitely a unique spot in Pittsburgh. A fun place to take out of towners or if you're looking for something a little different. Besides how loud it is on a busy night, I enjoy the atmosphere inside. The huge, old converted church lends itself to a restaurant better than you think it would. The alter was converted to the brewing area and the rest of the place is filled with tables and old church pews for some of the seating. They have a huge bar on one side and a wood fire pizza oven on the other. They also have an enclosed patio area for the nice weather.   The downfalls of this place are not in the fun decor but in the food and drinks. Everything I've consumed other than pizza is just .. okay.  They only serve the beer they brew in house, which limits the variety and quality you can choose from. When it comes to food they do have a lot of different options, but everything is divided on 2 food menus then a separate drink menu. Our table is always filled with tons of giant menus and it's just crowded. During our most recent visit we ordered chicken lettuce wraps and sweet potatoes fries to snack on. They were both good enough, but the lettuce wraps were $12 for a very small amount of chicken and some veggies to put in the wrap. The pizzas are definitely one of their best dishes, however due to a recent fire they will not be serving them for quite awhile!",

Whenever I have out of town visitors, I take them here for dinner. I prefer bar seating as there's usually no wait & you get the full menu. The only downside is tracking down a server on a busy night. I will say be VERY clear what you don't like when you take a servers recommendation. I love to get recommendations from staff but I'm a firm believer the staff here will recommend whatever needs to be drained regardless of what your taste preference is. I've made that mistake more than once.",

    "text": "I was extremely excited to check out Church Brew Works; the idea of a restaurant housed in an old church is very interesting to me. Unfortunately, I felt that my expectations were high and the atmosphere and experience fell short in the end.  I came to Church Brew Works with a couple of friends on a Friday night. We were expecting to have a long wait, but as a pleasant surprise we were able to be seated right away. As I mentioned before, Church Brew Works is inside of an old renovated church, which is a very hip idea. If you look up towards the altar, you see all of the brewing equipment for the beer. I like that the owners made an attempt to preserve the original feel of the church while also renovating it to a point that it feels new and interesting. At the same time, I feel that the decor could be a little bit more extensive. The owners had a major opportunity to make this one of the coolest and trendiest restaurants around, but I didn't feel a wow factor when I walked in.  We decided to order a couple appetizers, as we weren't extremely hungry but were looking for more of a snack. I will say that the food is a step above the traditional pub food I was expecting. We ordered the pork tostadas, the gouda and artichoke dip, and the French fries. The tostadas were a little cold when they arrived, but the flavors were nice. They kind of had a zesty Mexican taste to them. The gouda and artichoke dip was probably my favorite app that we ordered, and I would get it again. I do wish the dip was bigger though, as we had a lot of chips left over at the end and no dip for them. The French fries were surprisingly pretty good, and they came with a roasted red pepper sauce on the side that we all enjoyed much more than ketchup.  Overall, the food was better than I expected but also a bit pricey for simple small appetizers. I love the idea of the restaurant, but the execution was a little lacking for me. I don't think I would necessarily rush back to Church Brew Works anytime soon. However, I have heard very good things about the pizza here, so I would like to come back at some point to try it out!",

I mainly recommend avoiding the pizza if you can, I really was not crazy about it. With that being said, it's been a little while since the last time I went, so it's possible that the kitchen has improved in the time since then. And it's definitely interesting enough just based on how cool the location is to justify a visit, so I would still recommend it.",

But okay - let's be honest, the idea of drinking in a church is pretty funny - so we came here with lowered expectations... and it still wasn't great.  So - the service was pretty good and there's free parking... that's where the good points end.  We didn't grab any food here - but we sampled all the beers.  Nothing stood out and they sold out of their IPA.  Bleh.  The church itself was pretty unremarkable.  There are some stained glass windows, but it's pretty dark and unexpectedly muggy (I guess it makes sense considering all the brewery gear inside an old church).  I usually don't rag on places for decor -- but let's face it - you only come here to drink in an old church.  The odd mixture of old church, Pittsburgh sports flags and brewery equipment behind plexiglass wasn't too appealing.  I think they would have been better off if they doubled-down on the church concept - instead, it feels like a theme restaurant.  Once again, AVOID.  The beer sucks and not worth the trek.",

I'll go if others really want to, but it is not on my top 10 list at all. It was also odd. If you sit on one side you get one menu; the other side another and you couldn't order off of the \"other\" side's menu. That seemed very weird to me.  When they first opened their pizza drew you in. Now, it seems secondary. And...and this is a big one...if you do order a pizza and they are particularly busy, you could wait a long time for your pizza. It seems if you are known for your pizza, you would perfect the timing of it better. Again, good food. Interesting atmosphere. But, just too loud for me (maybe I'm just old!!).",

See what I did there?  Anyway, I have a confession to make. I haven't stepped into a church for a very very long time. I'm not a church person. What I am is a beer person. That's my holy water, so when I heard of a brewery housed in an old church I had to check it out. This location started out as St. John the Baptist Church  in 1902, and converted in 1996.   First impression, the place is stunning. The former chapel room was magically transformed into a spacious beer hall. The place is HUGE. The interior is definitely worth a look and a photo exhibition. Murals with angels sharing a pint, large copper tanks behind the altar, amazing stained glass.  It was difficult for me to pick a beer I wanted to start with. The beer menu is very IPA laden,so I picked the Nut Brown Stout being a fan of darker beers. This beer completely turned me off to trying any other brew here. It was served warm and it had the appearance and taste of swamp water. I think I made a big mistake and ordered the worst beer on the menu. I had wished I had started with the sampler of eight 5oz pours, just to decipher where this breweries talents lie. It is not with stouts, let me tell you that.  For food, we started with the traditional pierogies. Fantastic. Simple. For our entrees we had the Shrimp and Grits ($23.50)- which were pan sauteed shrimp simmered in a cajun cream sauce. Served with creamy smoked gouda grits and micro greens salad. The shrimp were tiny and not worth the price of the entree. We also had the Shinkasa Cheesesteak ($12) which is the kobe beef cheesesteak. It sounds great on the menu, in person it is overcooked kobe with provolone on a gigantic roll. Looking around me, I think the meatloaf is the item you should order. It was popular and looked appetizing.  The best part of the meal, was the dessert. The brewmisu featuring lady fingers that were dipped into a coffee-wort (wort  is the liquid extracted from the mashing process during the brewing of beer or whisk) reduction and layered with fresh Mascarpone cheese. It was large enough to feed four, and it was so light and moist.  This place should be on your Pittsburgh bucket list, the beer is not my favorite, but doesn't mean this isn't a fun spot to grab a pew and chill with your friends. I would come back for the brewmisu though if I lived here, that could be a bad habit...",

There is an interesting selection of rotating beers. I will definitely attempt to acquire more CBW beer in the future; unfortunately, I don't think it will be at this venue.  To start, it took about 10 minutes to get the attention of one of the bartenders. That's just too long especially when everyone is ordering just beer. Also, the bartender brought us the wrong beers. We ordered the belgian tripels, and he be brought us american barleywines. I should have noticed from the color and said something immediately, but I decided to give it a shot with the likely chance that I was wrong. Upon tasting, my suspicion was confirmed; however, I really enjoyed the style, so I didn't ask the bartender to correct it. I'm glad I tried something new, yet it shouldn't have happened this way.  The atmosphere is very similar to Hofbrauhaus'. It's very loud with a eclectic clientele; similar to Hofbrauhaus, there are many family casually dining. one big difference is that no one is dancing on their seat. I would also assert that folks here appear to be less drunk which I'd attribute to the smaller serving glasses. Also, there didn't seem to be a beer garden.",

We got a flight to taste the different beers, which is a good deal considering the size of the samples.  We each liked about 1/2 the beers we sampled. Only one was unanimously considered bad- the rest were just a personal preference thing.   Food ranged between \"eh, pretty good\" to good.  Pizza- good, but SUPER greasy Alligator plantain pierogi app- best thing we had Meatloaf- pretty good  Bison burger - pretty good  Mashed potatoes and fries - mmm!",

    "text": "Hungry for a late-night bite to eat after visiting friends and their brand new baby, we headed to Church Brew Works.  I'm a little obsessed with old historic buildings repurposed for new causes.  While it probably started with the old firehouse converted into mansion circa The Real World: Boston, I've always liked the idea of living or working in a historic place.  Church Brew Works, as its name implies, is a brewpub in an old church.  You're definitely struck by the unique setting when you walk in.  While the beer is great, they're also noted for good food.  We were starving, so we started with the Bison Corn Dogs, served with honey mustard, pickled veggies, and a chipotle ketchup.  They felt like saltier, meatier versions of state fair corn dogs, and I liked the subtle kick from the ketchup.  My absolute favorite part of the visit was the brick-oven pizza.  We chose the Garden Plum Tomato Pizza, which had garden plum tomato sauce, basil, garlic, olive oil, and some really fresh mozzarella.  The whole pizza tasted super fresh, and the ratio of cheese and sauce was spot on.  My favorite part was the crust.  They are used some beautiful dough here, because it was pretty much my ideal consistency for pizza... chewy, with a fluffy crust!",

Ordered the flight to get a taste of what Church Brew Works was all about, but I was not impressed at all.  The flavors were underwhelming and flat.  The rotating stout was the only one that was halfway decent.  However, one does not get to drink beer in church very often!  And in a beautiful church nonetheless.  So, the experience alone is worth a visit.  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'll have to try the grub..that meatloaf looks heavenly ;)",

The beer is decent and the food is good. The couple of times I've been there, the service has been just okay though. The last time I was there with a big group, and I know that's not always what servers like to see coming through the door, I did feel like our server acted a little peeved with us the whole time I were there. But hey, if I worked at a restaurant where the management refused to provide full-time employees with paid sick leave, I might be a little peeved too (looking at you CBW management, I really hate the idea of getting the flu from a someone serving my food who couldn't afford to take and unpaid sick day).  The food is usually pretty good, and the atmosphere is really fun. It's definitely a place you'd enjoy if you're visiting Pittsburgh. Maybe not somewhere I'd make a regular go-to though.  (Seriously management, paid sick days for your employees would be great..think about it!)",

    "text": "I have to give the owners the award for the most creative place to put a brewery and restaurant.    I am big into craft brews these days and this place looked like my kind of church.  Reminds me of my favorite church, the Church of the Bloody Mary.  But wait, this is about beer...  The place is huge as you would expect from an old church and a Catholic one, no less.  I stepped in on a Friday afternoon between lunch and dinner time and the place was quite dead.  So I settled in at the bar.    Some of the beer tanks were located right behind the bar which was on the left side of the \"church\".  The rest of it was in the old altar.  The old pew areas were converted into table seating areas for the restaurant.   They even used the old pews for some of the seating. Very creative.  As for the beer, they had 10 beers on tap which is a lot for a craft brewery.  I started out with a sampler that included 8 of those 10.  All of the beers were served almost warm.  Well it was hot outside and I was looking for a cold beer so I guess the church didn't come with refrigeration or maybe that's how the Catholics liked their beer - warm.  Anyway, none of them really impressed me.  So I was looking at the beer menu and saw the Cherry Quadzilla that I had not tried yet.  That is not part of the sampler because of the higher alcohol content.  They let me sample this and that was the beer I fell in love with here.  I am not normally into fruit flavored beers but there's something about Cherry beers that I enjoy.  Never had one I didn't like.  Just wish they had the Thundergod IPA on tap that some of the other reviewers mentioned.  Oh well.    I didn't stay to eat here but their menu looked interesting.  The perogie dish is something I would like to try someday if I ever make it back here.    For beer, I give this a 3.  Because out of 10 beers, you'd think I'd enjoy more than one.  For Atmosphere, I give it a 5.  Who would have thought to put a brewery in a church?  Rating average...4.",

In other words, I don't really go there for the food.  I've never had a disappointing food item.  The pizza is out of this world and the appetizers and daily specials always have something interesting that catches my eye.    While the food is good, the beer is better.  I find myself a fan of their seasonal offerings more than the signature brews which makes me sad because I keep having to find a new favorite.  Ask for samples if you're not sure.  But if you find something you really like that's a seasonal, get a growler before you leave.  My overall experience here is that the bartenders are better than the waiters.  In other words if there's only two of you, sit at the bar.  You'll likely get better service.",

Seeing we were coming for lunch around 1:30PM the lady she spoke to said there would be no need for reservations and it might start to get busy around 3:00PM due to the game end. We got there at 2:00PM and were immediately seated in the back and around 3:00 it started to fill (she hit it on the nose), the noise level was moderate. We started we Lobster Bisque and Beer Steamed Mussels. The bisque was good with plenty of tender lobster, no your traditional tomato base. The mussels were cooked beautifully, but the beer broth made the bitter to the point we could not enjoy the bread for dipping.   My wife had the Filet Mignon with mashed potatoes for her entree and I had scallops with Risotto. The Filet was cooked perfectly, MR with asparagus and roasted pepper on potatoes. The mash was cold!  Unfortunately, the Scallops and Risotto was not cooked correct.  Let me start as I would have sent these back but due to being Valentine my wife dislikes when I have to point out problems.  The Scallops were raw and wound up eat the outside edge of two and took home to cook, only cooked on one side.  The Risotto was over cooked and dry not at all creamy as you would expect, as if it were cooked earlier in the day and sitting in a pot waiting to be served. I guess no one was checking the food before it goes out to be sure all the plates are done right",

    "text": "This is my first review on Yelp, as I was waiting for a truly inspirational experience about which to write. After Church Brew Works, one might say I was born again.  I was in Pittsburgh for the first time this past week, attending a conference for work. The conference, while worth the travel in and of itself, more importantly provides an excellent chance to reconnect with colleagues from around the country. Thus, I was looking forward to the unstructured time in evenings, and choosing the gathering place for such periods is a delicate art. I ended up spending two nights at Church Brew Works, and it's not as though there was a lack of options. This place is special.  The first night, I went to CBW after dinner. Upon arrival, I ordered the sampler to split with a friend, to get our bearings and at least have a taste of the four mainstays and the four seasonals. The sampler was priced right at around $14 for eight five-ounce glasses. While I was less excited by some brews (like the Celebration), I was amazed by the complexity of both the Rotating Stout and the Four-Grain Harvest Ale. I drank Harvest Ales until they kicked us out that night.  The second night, we headed back to CBW for dinner. This night, I drank Rotating Stout exclusively. Very crisp for a stout, with an awesome smokey finish. I ordered the salmon entree for dinner. For $19, I figured it had to be good. Plus, the drafts were very reasonably priced, so I didn't mind spending a bit more on food. The salmon truly exceeded my expectations. It was perfectly cooked with minimal seasoning and placed atop a refreshing quinoa salad with cucumber. Sauteed oyster mushrooms accompanied the fish, which were delicious. The plate was ringed with a tasty soy reduction to provide salt, which complemented all the items perfectly. I could see how the soy might have been a bit strong for someone else, but I think it brought an appropriate kick to the dish.  I continued to drink the Rotating Stout all night while we discussed the eventual collapse of civil society. Perfect conversation against the backdrop of an altar filled with heavy brewing equipment. There is something post-apocalyptic yet fantastically optimistic about CBW. Perhaps it's the not-so-subtle notion that our reverie should not be focused on a deity hovering in the heavens or a member of the clergy thumping on the pulpit, but rather, toward one another, in a place where the provisions nourish the soul and the communion is about building community.",

    "text": "Lately I have been frequenting the Church Brew Works because of visitors coming into town and because my office really likes to order lunch from there.   This is what I have found. Since I am in summer work out mode I tend to eat salads and protein a ton. What's better than a Buffalo Brgr! I get this as my lunch every so often. Juicy, lean, flavorful, bison, cooked medium well! No bun with a side of broccoli. It keeps me full, tastes wonderful and powers me up for a P90 workout!   I also LOVE the Pulled pork sandwich and Cuban! I did like the pulled pork better when they served it on a pumpernickel raisin bun!   So lets talk fire brick oven pizza! I like simplicity so the mozzarella, basil is my favorite! Pair that with the beer sampler and you have quite a nice Saturday afternoon couples outing!   The last time I went to dine with my family we all ordered different items then shared everything! We had the shrimp carbonara, crispy vegetarian polenta, and the Buffalo and wild mushroom meatloaf. The carbonara was creamy and bacony, just as it should be. The meatloaf was super juicy and had a very good flavor, my dish the veggie polenta was tomato based and just ok, It is perfect option if you are vegan or watching calories!   I just love bringing out of towners here, the majestic space and the ambiance, are unmatched. Be ready to become infused with a hoppy humidity! There is also a cute outdoor patio that is very inviting. Everyone in Pitt should frequent here!   On a side note, I had ordered a pizza to go for my family the day we went since they had helped me move. It ended up being burned on the top so check your to go's! Management was extremely accommodating and hooked me up with a pie when I brought my friend for the sampler! Thanks Brew works!!",

I tried their sampler beers and I was really impressed, Pittsburgh has some great local beers I must say. To eat I was reccommended the Pierogi Pizza, sounds like an odd combo but I was up for it. To my surprise I really liked it and would reccommend it for those of you reading this. I also had the 7 onion soup which was basically their version of french onion soup, still it was good. My aunt had the seasonal pumpkin soup-holy cow, its like pumpkin pie but soup-amazing!  As I am from Los Angeles, I really take a liking to novelty places like this as we dont really have them here. But if I was a local you'd probably find me frequenting this place. If I'm ever in the area again this will be the first stop I make.",

    "text": "Church Brew Works provides a traditional beer hall atmosphere in a transformed church.  For a local craft brewery, Church Brew Works does offer some very tasty options on draft and what I would consider to be the best beer flight in Pittsburgh - in terms of tasting experience.  From a brewery standpoint, Church Brew Works certainly does not disappoint.   From a food perspective, the brewery provides the standard pub options that would be expected.  There aren't many stand out options on the menu, but it is certainly not difficult to find something to hold over ones appetite between pints of the enjoyable craft beer.  The food selection leaves more to be desired, however, the food taste pairs nicely with the beers on tap. This is certainly a location where the drink rules supreme and the food merely follows.  A great location for an evening out with friends or for private events.",

    "text": "Had a great afternoon meal at The Church Brew Works yesterday. On a previous trip to Pittsburgh we had tried to eat there but found not a single spare seat and did nothing more than peek in the door. This time we arrived around 2pm on Saturday and there were plenty of seats available. I won't speak to the coolness of the actual space as I'm sure many others before me have done a great job. Only thing I will say is how cavernous it is but yet you feel cozy - the low lighting helps lend itself to that mood as do the bright stained glass windows.  We started with the pierogi's of course (un-traditional). These were a mix of kielbasa, potato, and onion on the inside and on the top a mustard and horseradish sauce. Wish I had ordered more because they were gone way to quickly! I ordered the lunch size (9\") Portabello Pesto pizza and Dave ordered the Artichoke, Spinach, and Feta pizza. We both preferred the Portabello by far but both were yummy. Andy had a Char-Grilled Buffalo burger with spiced fries and said he enjoyed it.   Dave and Andy ordered the Pipe Organ Pale Ale and the Celestial Gold. Consensus was for the Celestial Gold. Andy also ordered a bottle of Quadzilla - a Belgian Style Cherry Wheat and I found it similar to Lambic (one of two kinds of 'beer' which I do drink) and very tasty.  Overall - I would recommend it to friends/family and hope to go again.  PS - I think it's funny that there were 33 votes for Alcohol: None in the survey :-P",

I always get excited for Oktoberfest and the Wiener Schnitzel Holstein.  Could not wait to get there again this year.  Sorry to say, the cutlet was thick, and overcooked in the deep fryer as were the potato pancakes.  My husband and I still looked forward to the bread pudding for dessert.  It was as dry as the desert!  The waiter was kind enough to take the bread pudding off the bill, but when my husband handed him a $20 and asked for change, he thanked him, did an about face and walked off with a more than generous tip that was not deserved.  Needless to say, this place has turned into a tourist trap that we will never again return.  There are plenty of good food and beer establishments in the area, with much better service.",

    "text": "How much fun is this place?!?  I'll tell you.  It's loads of fun.    First things first: a big thank you to Pitt Yelper Kat M. for suggesting husband and I come here on our trip to the 'Burgh.  You were right, we loved Church Brew Works!  If you're at all sensitive about your religious iconography, this might not be the place for you.  This former Catholic church -- St. John the Baptist -- was once a well attended congregation which slowly dwindled as the steel mills closed and residents moved out of the neighborhood.  Eventually the Diocese decided to close St. John's doors, sent a priest to desanctify the building, and put it up for sale.  In 1996, after three years of construction (during which the original building and fixtures, including floors, pews, and stained glass windows were carefully restored or preserved), Church Brew Works microbrewery and restaurant opened it doors.  While some of the former congregants are unhappy with this holy conversion, for the most part CBW has been quite well received not only in the neighborhood, but by Pittsburghers on the whole.  [We got all this helpful info from our excellent server -- good on CBW for educating its servers about the history of the church and brewery.  You *know* these questions come up often.]  For two heathens like husband and me, downing tasty microbrews in a church pew overlooking beer tanks occupying a former altar is nothing short of a religious experience.  We enjoyed the Pious Monk Dunkel, Paganator Doppel Bock, Thunder Hop IPA, Millennium Trippel, and a special brew for their Caribbean-themed kick-off-to-summer celebration, Coconut Stout.  CBW makes some mighty fine brews.  Husband also had an order of their housemade pierogi.  The flavor of the day was alligator and plantain with a spicy mango sauce.  CBW is such a different place, the kind of spot you wish would open up in your own neighborhood.    Our brewery, which art in Pittsburgh, hallowed be thy name.  Forever and ever.  Aaaaa-men.",

    "text": "I really enjoy The Church Brew Works. The atmosphere alone is enough to keep me coming back, and the food is also good! It's loud, so be prepared speak up when chatting with your friends. The acoustics in a beautiful old church will do that - but dining in such a unique environment is worth it.   If you visit you'll notice that the confessional booths have been repurposed, as is the pulpit - which now houses brewing equipment.   The menu is always changing - there are staples of course, but it seems like every time I visit the chef has found a new spin to put on an old favorite. Make sure you ask what the \"Untraditional Pierogi\" is. I've had a few, and I was lucky enough to visit when they had rattle snake pierogis (which were delicious).   Another little known secret is the espresso bar - so if you happen to prefer coffee over beer, grab a shot of espresso! It comes garnished with a little bit of spiralized lemon peel. I'd never had espresso this way, but adding the lemon peel to the espresso was delightful and really brought out some different notes in the espresso that I hadn't tasted before. I definitely will try it this way again!   The pepperoni rolls are also good if you're looking for bar food, as is the Buffalo burger.   Oh, and save room for dessert. The resident pastry chef is extremely talented. I had an AMAZING apfelstrudel (apple strudel) that is possibly one of the best things I've ever tasted. It was a light fluffy puff pastry, perfectly golden brown, with some kind of crumb and apple filling, topped with ice cream and a delicious vanilla sauce. Soooo good!",

My favorite beer was the New England IPA, my wife really liked the Oktoberfest.  We had the warm crab dip, which was pretty good. We also each had a bowl of soup. They have their own signature French onion soup which really was fantastic, and a creamy potato soup which was also very good. There's so much to take in while you're there, and the bartender was both helpful and outgoing. They all were actually very personable. They knew about the beers, the menu, and some history of the Brewery/Church. It was also nice to find out that this restaurant has a private lot behind the church, so our next visit will be easier (we thought it was street parking only).",

    "text": "Came here for dinner on a weeknight.  We ordered their pizza roll appetizer with spinach artichoke dip that came with tortilla chips.  Hubby ordered their buffalo chicken pierogi saute and I ordered their mushroom meatloaf.  We ordered their bread pudding for dessert and got 2 scoops of chocolate cookie ice cream.  What's hot - The atmosphere.  Very unique.  Not often you can find a church that's been converted to a brewery. - Flavor.  The taste of the food was pretty decent.  I address some of the quality issues below, but despite that, the flavor of the food was good.  Not bangin, but good. - Menu variety.  There's something for everyone, which is helpful.  They have vegetarian menu options, too.  Their drinks selection is pretty cool, especially because they brew their own beer.      What's not - No reservations.  We came with some family and they tried to make reservations, but they wouldn't take it.  Seems impractical that they don't take reservations, especially if you have a decent size party. - Portions.  Our waiter told us that the spinach artichoke dip was a good portion that could feed the 4 in our party.  Dudes, not the case.  The dip was in a small bowl (prolly 1-2 inches in diameter).  It most definitely was not a good portion. - My meat loaf was dry.  When I would cut into my meatloaf, the pieces would sometimes fall apart. - The buffalo chicken pierogi saute didn't have the chicken meat in the pierogis.  Hubby and his brother expected chicken in the pierogi.  Dudes, the menu specifically has an untraditional pierogi dish listed on the menu.  The description on the menu wasn't good enough and it's misleading.  While the pierogis were still good, the menu was misleading. - Brother and his gf ordered frozen peanut butter pie for dessert.  And dudes, it was seriously frozen.  As in, it took serious effort to cut through the pie in order to eat it.  We get that it's a frozen pie, but you shouldn't make the customers work so hard to eat their food.   - Service.  Once we paid for our check, our waiter didn't come by.  Our group stayed to chat for a little while after we were done.  For me, the mark of good service is when the wait staff check in on you after.  Cuz dudes, who knows if there may be another order coming?  Final answer Willing to come back, but not a first choice.",

He didn't seem pleased by my destination all too much. And I'll admit -- it did feel kind of sacrilegious to imbibe in an old church, but also kind of neat...and certainly abnormal.  I'd say come here more for the photo ops and atmosphere itself rather than beer quality. It seems like a cool place to hang out. I met an old friend for happy hour and it served as an ideal, chill location to spend some time catching up. Happy hour specials = half-off prices. Our server recommended ordering drafts over tasters or a flight. I chose their mango wheat beer, which was...what you'd expect from a wheat beer. I didn't order any food.  I think it was a nice place to experience once, especially as a first-time visitor to Pittsburgh, but I'd give future priority to other breweries.",

The stained glass and the rest of the interior was fascinating to look at while we ate lunch.    The food itself was also not very appetizing. I went with the Bahn Mi Steak sandwich, which had sriracha mayo on top of the sandwich inside of spread inside. Made it very difficult to eat. It also had basil which I could barely taste. Not enough meat for the high priced sandwich and the fries were very bland. Their tripple was a very tasty beer. They do have a huge beer menu, but unfortunately none were available. Overall I wouldn't be returning.",

This is apparent when you enter this beautifully adorned church and see the brewing equipment front and center on the altar. Walking past the pews and extravagant stained glass windows with a beer in hand almost feels blasphemous, but after a few sips you are reminded that this is just a really cool concept and a way to preserve a True work of art (both the building and the beer).  They had a great selection of your standard pub food and prices were reasonable. The beer was very tasty and they had a range of flavors at many levels of alcohol (Jack Skeleton was our favorite). The nachos were good and well-portioned and the in-traditional pierogis were also tasty. Service was good as our waiters were friendly, attentive, and provided some great recommendations on beer. Between the ambiance, beer, and food, you cannot go wrong and this is truly a different experience worth trying out.",

    "text": "I originally rated Church Brew Works back in 2013.  This was after a few visits both just to sit at the bar and to have dinner.  Four years ago I was less of a beer snob and the Church had their pizza oven.  I am updating my review after two visits in 2017.  My wife, daughter and I visited shortly after they lost their brick oven for pizza and were underwhelmed, I thought maybe it was a fluke, but after my last lackluster visit I cannot keep staying positive.  Some friends were in town and wanted to find a place that would both accommodate the 7 of us and not be a chain.  Since we had kids we had to sit on the right side of the church, which is now \"fine dining\".  We tried to get the bar menu after looking at the menu, but were told no.  It was awkward sitting at that table for 10 minutes just starring at the choices.  We had no one come greet us and ask us about drinks, we just sat wondering what we'll have for dinner.  The menu consists of a mishmash of high end and try hard.  Pierogies, ribs, steaks, and pastas ranging from $15-$30 a plate.  Nothing jumped out at us....it was sad.  I was just about to ask if everyone wanted to just leave when finally a server asked us if we wanted some beer.  My good friend got the coconut stout and my wife the Pipe Organ Pale.  Both were good, but in Pittsburgh standards today fell flat as there are much better options.  We ended up staying and got the pork nachos and spinach roll for apps.  The spinach roll was tasty, crispy, and satisfying.  The nachos were good enough to pick at, but again were average like the beers.  The kiddos all got their chicken fingers and random sides.  My daughter wanted sweet potato fries, but that's a $2 up-charge....so another words a $10 kids meal.  No way.  My wife split the full rack of ribs and while they were good, I again didn't want to gorge myself on them and will not be back to have them again. I miss the pizza, the allure has worn off, and the menu is an expensive mess.  Sorry to say, but after years of recommending the Church Brew Works I will no longer. It was fun while it lasted.",

While the atmosphere can be overwhelming for me, their food and brews are top notch and a favorite of mine. I will often buy their beer from local distributors.   The Church itself is a beautiful building and quite the spot to convert into a brewery. Pious Monk Dunkel and Thunderhop are my two favorites for different reasons. Pious Monk surprised me the first time I drank it because I was expecting something so much heavier, but it's surprisingly light for a lager, and it allows you to enjoy all of the flavors it imparts. Thunderhop is just a dream come True for hop lovers, plus the art on the bottle is pretty awesome if I do say so myself.   While their menu is certainly a pub menu, it goes above and beyond to provide options for all kinds of needs - whether you're gluten-free or vegetarian or like to chow down on quality meat-based entrees.",

    "text": "I actually have Catholic guilt for not reviewing Church Brew Works until now as I've been here countless times over the years.  And Catholic guilt is appropriate for this venue as, obviously, \"Church\" Brew Works is located in a very old Catholic Church.    When you walk in if you're Catholic, by habit, you'll want to dip your hands into the Holy Water holder that is sans Holy Water.  But your eyes will immediately go to the old altar that now holds large vessels that are brewing and fermenting some pretty great beer.  That being said, be aware that you're going to smell some pretty strong malty-sweet aromas from the brewing.  On my most recent visit it was stronger than I would have preferred.  But no fear, we were able to sit outside, which is like transforming yourself into a scene from Harvard in the late 1800's.  The little courtyard patio outside is two levels surrounded by brick walls covered in ivy.  You can sit with a small group or bring all your friends and grab the picnic table with the long bench.  Either scenario is going to be great.  Onto the food.  Oh how I love the menu here.  I always want to go for the wood fired pizzas because they rock - and there are so many culinary treats to choose from like pierogie pizza or chicken and pineapple or wild boar BBQ.  That's right, I said Wild Boar and I'm not lying.  Amazing thin crust wood fired to perfection.    The menu typically has a salmon or some sort of fish but what you can always count on is a delicious pierogie option.  You're in Pittsburgh and Church Brew Works does their pierogies right.  On my most recent visit I had buffalo chicken pierogies and truth be told (we were in church so I cannot tell a lie) there wasn't a crumb left on my plate.    If you have friends in town visiting Pittsburgh for the first time or the tenth impress them by taking them to Church Brew Works.  Because I guarantee that they'll go back to their hometown and will tell all their friends about this awesome treasure.  Amen.",

    "text": "We had a nice time here with friends last weekend. Food was decent and they had a nice variety on the menu. We had the non-traditional perogies and buffalo cauliflower for appetizers. My meal was a Farro salad and hubs had the lettuce wraps. My girlfriend had the lamb meatballs which she loved and her husband had the perogie saute. Everybody was happy with their food. The vast beer menu was lost on me just because I'm not a beer drinker. The guys really liked theirs tho. I prefer a cocktail but I wasn't impressed by the Moscow Mule I ordered. My friend liked it so I passed it over and switched to a Tanquerey and Tonic which was made just right. This wouldn't go down on my list of favorites but it was solid and an interesting setting.",

    "text": "A+ for decor and ambience. The beer and food falls a bit flat. This is the type of place I take visiting friends to since they are wowed with the setting but wouldn't ever really go to with Pittsburghers. Just underwhelmed with the beer.   Ambience: No brewery in Pittsburgh can compete with this one in this category. When have I ever been in a desanctified church where the pulpit is filled with beer tanks?! Some might find it sacrilegious but most people find it entertaining. Plus they have ample televisions around to keep the sports watchers happy.   Drinks: I've had the Pious Monk Dunkel and the Cherry Quadzilla. I'm a big Belgian beer fan but both really needed some love. The Dunkel is average at best, lacking a complex finish. The quadzilla was probably one of the worst quads I've had. Overpowered with artificial cherry flavoring and similarly simplistic in its flavor profile. Really missed the mark.   Food: The only thing we tried were the pierogi. Over lathered with butter and just like the beers, somewhat bland. It felt like average bar food at best.   Service: No issues on this part but nothing over the top either.",

The place is awesome to look at and view but you pay a pretty penny to be able to look around with some small portions. The beer was great and I would consider coming for just a drink but our food was nothing to rave about. I purchased a salad that I ate 1/2 of and my boyfriend got a dish that was too small, we ended up getting food again later!

Amazing! The food was great!  I had the pirogies with cream sauce, broccoli, and tomatoes. Everything was perfect. Normally I would think the broccoli was over cooked but it was exactly as it should be in that meal. Also the tomatoes were not cooked but added at the end warming them and not letting them turn to mush. Perfect.  The staff was friendly, personable and helpful Looking  forward to our next visit.",

    "text": "I was just reminded to rate Church Brew Works after reading another yelp review that mentioned the smell of the place. It is very obviously caused by the beer they brew there, but it reminds me of being in a barn. Not a barn with dirty animals, but an old barn with lots of old hay all over the ground. It's not CBW's fault that I can't handle that smell because that is a side effect of brewing beer within a restaurant, but I can't do it.    The only other con for CBW is that I don't like some of their beer. Let me be clear, *some* of their beer is not for me, but I've had a few that I like, and if you're unsure you can always order samples. Every time I've been to CBW the staff has been great and they are more than willing to bring samples (and take pictures of you and your best friend who is visiting from out of town.)  All of the food I've eaten at CBW was good, but the desserts were really GREAT. The most memorable dessert experience involved splinting multiple desserts (something seasonal and another off the regular menu), and BEER ICE CREAM. Beer. Ice Cream. Do I need to say more? It was better than expected.   One last note- I hate saying things that are even slightly negative if the restaurant has done nothing wrong, and Church Brew Works really has a lot of things going very well for them, but me being \"sensitive\" (or something) can't handle inhaling barn-like fumes while eating.    Everyone else I've visited CBW with has been 100% okay with the smell (and everything else they have to offer.)",

Located in Lawrenceville this brewery and restaurant has amazing food and beer while enjoying the beautiful church. I'm not religious so this doesn't bother me one bit but looking at the other reviews it appears it has bothered some people giving it bad reviews for no reason. People! This was going to get torn down if it weren't for the brewery purchasing it. If you don't like the concept, don't go. Period. Okay rant over! The feta, spinach, Gouda dip is delicious and addicting. The pierogies are scrumptious and I eat these every time. The pizzas are also delicious and if I had to choose one I couldn't they are all good. The beer! Love the pipe organ pale ale! All the other beers are good and you must try them! Love this place!",

    "text": "On a personal level, when this place was still a church, my aunt got married here. It's also where my dad had his First Holy Communion.  And walking through those thick wooden doors, Church Brew Works still retains the elegant, ornate beauty of a church, with pews as booths and the alter being home to the brewery equipment. A lot of the original stained glass is there too. It's breathtaking.  One drawback to the atmosphere is the constant echo of conversations. It can difficult to hear people talking at your table if it's busy.  Service is good, but it can be damn slow, especially if anyone at your table orders a wood fired pizza. Expect at least a 30-minute wait from the time you order. They're tasty, but a pain if you want to get in and out fast. Pierogi fillings are often novelty and overpriced. (I think at one point they had shark meat stuffed ones?) Not my favorite when there are many, more traditional pierogi options in the city.  Sandwiches are OK and desserts are decent, particularly the bread pudding. I ordered the seasonal pumpkin bread pudding to share and it was awesome. It was very decadent with layers of flavor.  I've never had the beer, but they also brew pop. I once was a huge fan of the birch beer, similar to a root beer, but the quality has gone down over time. It was once more flavorful; it's tasted more watered down during more recent visits. They usually brew one other pop. One time it was cherry soda. Another time it was cream soda.  It's worth a visit for the atmosphere alone. The food is OK, but not particularly memorable.",

Food is good but inconsistent. We have had the gourmet wood fired pizza several times and each time the crust and toppings are coming out under or overcooked and portioned differently. The mussels are perfect each time. But had to request bread to dip in the beer and garlic sauce which is heavenly! Philly Cheesesteak is brimming with steak and goodies. Beet salad is delicious as well although beets not wood fire roasted as claimed on menu. Onion Soup is mouthwatering in aroma and undeniable savory flavor in it's broth and cheese/bread top. The bacon/perogie pizza was doughy, rushed, with undercooked bacon. Food is pricey, more than normal pubs but balances out as you remember you are dining in a unique repurposed landmark.",

    "text": "This place is mayhem on a Saturday night.  We somehow managed to wrestle a tall, four-person bar table right upon arrival so the killer waits and crowd didn't affect us much. There is the waiting list for the restaurant side (right), and the free-for-all that is the bar (left) side. Every man for himself, regardless of how you slice it.  We had the pierogis and 'Belgian' fries to open, and split two pizzas amongst the four of us. The peirogis were excellent; the fries were just fries with a dish of aioli - i guess aioli makes them Belgian. One pizza (pierogi again) was solid, the other struggled with flavor - so much so that I can't even remember what was on it. The crust on that one was also undercooked, with the edges burnt (oven temp issue?). We also had two flights of the beer sampler, and those were excellent. I was checking out non-pizza items all around us and can safely say that the food is probably not great across the board - it looks like a lot of straight up, low-end bar food. That's not horrible, but just advice for the eating side of the world. It's a pretty cool place if you don't mind crowds and noise. Certainly worth a visit.",

Yes, it's just like its advertised...a Roman Catholic church turned restaurant/brewery.   The food we had was adequate. No over portion sizes for Lunch here. Prices were good.   A trip to a brewery without tasting beer is just unAmerican...so we had a few samples. The IPA was hoppy as expected with the bite in the aftertaste quite brisk.  What I found even better was the Cherry Quadzilla, a special beer they make, not always on tap but today it was. Has such great flavor, goes down smooth, cherry/Carmel taste with just a hint of bite.  Could drink it all day, however with the higher than most alcohol content, I don't recommend too much if you have to drive!   All and all it was a great experience. The chocolate moose cake is good for an ending treat!! ( comes with 3 pieces of peanut brittle on the side). For me to say it was good means something because I don't even like chocolate cake!!  Will definitely be going back again in the near future!!",

    "text": "For people into the basics here it is short n' sweet:  Location/Building: 5/5 Beautiful. Unique. Interesting. Very open and airy. A distinct smell of yeast and a mix of delicious food smells.  Service: 2.5/5 I'm horribly disappointed by our reservation not being a reservation at all and really rushing our meal which had originally intended to go from around 8pm - 10pm.  Food: 2/5 While it was not bad food by any means, for the price I could make entire meals with far more flavor. The portions were big, but even big portions of mediocre food isn't all that great.  Beer: 5/5 Outstanding. I will definitely be back for more beer, and maybe I'll allow the food another pass.   The details:  I went to the Church Brew Works for the first time last night. I pass it twice a day 5 days a week and I've been curious for ages as to this fabled fine eatery and brew house within a church. I have to say though, maybe my expectations were too high.   The entire point of going was for a friend's birthday gathering. An initial party of maybe 15. She had called days ahead and they said they could accommodate us. Upon arriving we were told it wasn't actually a \"reservation\" so much as a \"request.\" Regardless of the fact that we had told them how many, what day, and the exact time DAYS in advance. After sitting for 15 minutes we down graded the party to 12 as some people hadn't shown. We grabbed some Pumpkin Stouts and waited another 30 minutes before downgrading to the 9 of us that had shown up and we still waited nearly 10 minutes more.   Being under some time constraints this really put a damper on the evening. Although after the almost 50 minute wait we walked through the restaurant which is lovely with gorgeous high ceilings, a festive air, and a glass wall behind the altar through which you can see some of the brewing happening. We were seated on the altar which provides an amazing view of the entire restaurant. Our waiter was efficient, friendly, and apologetic for the wait. We had quick service and refills as often as we needed them. The food though, this is where I was really turned off from ever coming back for a meal.   They have two menus; a regular and a pub menu. The regular is very pricey and the pub menu is moderate to somewhat pricey. We all ended up ordering from the pub menu and while the food tasted good I don't think it was worth the 8$ - 12$ a pop. At all.",

    "text": "On a weekend trip to PA, we spent a day at Kennywood and then headed to Liberty Ave and the Church Brew Works. My sister and her boyfriend had taken my folks a while back and we had heard about this old Catholic church that had been converted into a brew pub and restaurant. So a day at the amusement park required a good, cold beer to close things out.   Now the idea of drinking in a church seems somewhat sacrilegious to one who grew up evangelical Methodist. In my home church, you don't drink - or at least you don't admit to fellow parishioners that you enjoy what Ben Franklin called the \"nectar of the Gods.\" So to walk into a holy cathedral to get our drink on was weird, but I was so glad we went.  The church is huge. This place must give \"overhead\" a run for its money. It's a beautifully maintained church, with much of the decor intact. Pews for bench seating, the altar rail, lights, Windows, no crucifixes, Marys or Saints, thank God - perhaps that would be too much.   The menu was a little foodsy-artsy, but not too expensive (for foodsy-artsy) and it was tasty. I had a turkey & brie sandwich that made me very happy.  I am not a beer connoisseur, so I can't really judge the beer, but I liked mine, Ian liked his, and my sister and Brad (Brad brews his own  award-winning beer) liked theirs, so I'd say that's great.  Why not five stars? Well, I have to say we had the bar menu, which was reasonably priced for the food. The other side of the church was the \"restaurant.\" I think if you charge much more for the same kind of food in this noisy of a place (old churches echo a lot), it would be a bit pricey for what you end up getting.  But for the bar menu and beer - a job well done!",

    "text": "Two stars because I appreciate someone stepping up to the plate and saving this old architectural gem of a Catholic church from the wrecking ball, even if it does mean there's a giant beer brewing apparatus on what used to be the altar.  One star because the beer I had - their \"black\" holiday brew - was very good, spicy and just the way I like it, and furthermore they had it available AFTER Christmas at a time when many brewpubs (if they bother to be open) will tell you they sold out of their Christmas beers before the holiday even arrived.  This place is also nice and big, probably about three times the size of many other brewpubs we've hit up, so there was no wait for a table for early dinner.   They do ask whether you want to be on the \"bar side\" or the \"restaurant side\"  (the sides are divided by what used to be the main center aisle of the church) without telling you the difference between the two, so I still don't really know what it is except the bar side has a bar and a TV.  Other than that they look alike.  Food choices were rather more meh than I was hoping for, though.  This place specializes in pierogis.  I don't know when pierogis got all trendy, but I grew up in Cleveland, they have been around for decades, and I don't get particularly excited by putting different fillings in them.  Apparently the Church does.  Whatever, I don't care.  They also serve pizza, sandwiches, burgers, nothing too interesting.  Given that I work near Philly, the last thing I want is a cheesesteak made in Pittsburgh.  I ended up ordering a big bowl of the beer cheese soup and wishing they had a more interesting menu.    Our waiter and the overall beer selection were the two weak points of this place.  It only has about 10 beers on the menu.  I was pleasantly excited and surprised when the waiter told me they had all the beers but one, as I'm more used to this and that being  \"out, sorry\" especially during busy holiday weeks.  I did find one good beer to drink, but I tend to like beer samplers with a few small glasses of different beers,  or at least buying one glass each of two different beers per visit.  I didn't see anything on the menu in the line of a sampler; it may be I missed it, or perhaps it wasn't being offered when we were there, but since I see someone below mentioning one, I'm kind of wondering why I didn't see it and why our waiter didn't mention it.  Furthermore, when I tried to order a second beer that was not too hoppy and not a stout, I found that of the three (3) choices I had in mind, all were available only in large size bottles, i.e. not available by the glass but only in a large size meant for people to share.  The large sizes were too much for just me to drink given that I'd already had a pint.  I'm looking over to a bar stretching most of the length of a large church and wonder what is the problem that it can't have more taps flowing and more beers to select from by the glass rather than by the huge bottle?  Very much a bummer.  Also, after the guy brought initial beers and took our order  - a meal that included a small cup of soup for my companion, and just a large bowl of soup for me - Mr. Waiter didn't think to ask me if I wanted my soup now or wait till the \"entree\" (i.e. my companion's burger) was brought out.  I generally need to eat something with my beer (that I already had), and I was hungry.  The guy brought the little cup of soup to my dinner partner, brought me nothing, and then disappeared for like 20 minutes or more leaving me with nothing to eat but a couple slices of bread from the basket.  I couldn't get his attention to bring my soup because he literally did NOT emerge into view for that whole time!  The restaurant wasn't anywhere near full or busy and there seemed to be several wait staff around so I don't know what the deal was.  There was also some weird manager type in shirt and tie standing in the aisle giving the wait staff dirty looks the whole time we were there.    Summary:  Atmosphere and decor A, beer quality A,  beer selection B- , food selection B, waiter C- .   I'd go again, but next time I'll sit on the bar side and see if it's any better over there.",

Its the prototypical place that you take your family when they come to town and want to personally view the sacrilege of multiple beer vats sitting on an re purposed church altar.    Thus the blessing and the burden of Church Brew Works: Its a great place that embodies Pittsburgh through and through.  Beer!  Wings!  Pizza!  Salad with French Fries!!!  Traditional Perogies!!!  Overpriced and over rated non traditional perogies like turkey dinner and bacon!!!  But its also notoriously crowded on weekends with customers from out of town asking if they are pronouncing \"yinz\" correctly and trying to insert \"n'at\" into conversation.  If you can beat the crowds to get a seat, I highly recommend the pizza and the Pittsburgh salad.  The rest of the menu is pretty hit or miss.  The quality of things like wings, sandwiches most appetizers vary wildly based on how busy the restaurant is on the given night.  Service is unremarkable but good.  Prices are a little steep, especially for the drinks.",

    "text": "This place holds a special place in my food-loving heart. As two people who love irony, my husband and I thought after eloping in Allegheny County Night Court, there would be no better place to have a \"reception\" than a church converted into a brewery. It's a cool space and worth a visit, though it is packed on weekend evenings.  My favorite on the dinner menu -- chicken pot pie! I love that it's not thick and goopy and that the topper is puff pastry and not traditional pie crust. On the pub menu -- LOVE the Southwest Chicken Wrap and traditional pierogies. Husband is a fan of the salmon.   I am giving it a 4 because the service has never been stellar -- typically if you're not sitting at the bar, you have to ask for the pub menu, which has pizza and sandwich options. I don't really get that -- because it's pretty much the old center aisle of the church that divides the bar side from the \"dining room\". But I have gotten a surly hostess (same one) on two occasions. No real greeting, no eye contact. So yeah, if you can get past that, the food is always spot on and tasty in my experience.  Oh! And the smell, it is distinctive. It doesn't bother me -- however, if you're turned off by woody, earthy smells -- you might want to skip.  Hehe, update -- another Yelper read this review and messages me that they actually changed their menu several months ago and don't have Chicken Pot Pie. Bummer to hear, but please note -- I was there 3-4 days before I wrote that review, I went there specifically for it and I didn't bother checking the menu. Our server simply  told me \"they didn't have that tonight\". Wish I would have known they don't have it ever!",

Church is turning out to be a regular go-to place on Saturday or Sunday afternoons for me, with my wife and/or friends. That time of the day on the weekend it is usually pretty quiet (serene?). It can get extremely busy in the evenings, though. The beers are great, the food is better than you would expect (and in its own right very good), and service is usually good too. I'd say on the food front the pizzas are the best. And stick to the basics (e.g., pepperoni). I've tried their bison burger once and wasn't a fan, though kudos to the kitchen for putting out a medium rare burger that was actually medium rare (I find at a lot of places in Pittsburgh that if you order medium rare you get medium instead).

For dinner I had the cheesesteak that was made with actual steak rather than roast beef lunch meat, something that is hard to find in Pittsburgh. The peppers were a bit overlooked for my liking as I prefer that they have a bit of crunch. The sweat potato fries were good but nothing special. The food and the beer left me wanting more (in life not for the night, I was plenty full) and I will be going back.",

This place is a bit pricey, but you've got to think about the costs that you rack up when you set up shop IN A CHURCH!

I think that the food is decent, and the beer very reasonable in quality.  Ultimately though people come here for the overall experience.  We had some friends from Chicago come here to visit who were very Catholic, they had a great time eating there (although they felt like they needed to go to a confessional).",

I ended up having the salmon, which was great but not the best compared to some other places that I ate at on the east coast.

    "text": "The Church Brew Works in the former St. John the Baptist church on Liberty Ave is one of my absolute favorite restaurants anywhere.  I've been here for lunch, dinner, happy hours, and special events (birthdays and wedding rehearsal dinners).  I don't even know where to begin.  They keep the place immaculate, and there really is no pun intended here.  It's gorgeous.  The atmosphere is unique, one could even say post-modern.  I could gush about the pleasure of having a tasty meal under a vaulting, airy ceiling with sunlight streaming through the stained glass windows... so I am.  I was raised Catholic in Pittsburgh and attended both the school and the church of St. Kieran's right up the road from here and, although not particularly holy myself now, have been broken hearted by how many of the gorgeous churches in the city were shuttered by the ruthless bishop, who ironically seems to have followed me to DC...  that's to say I think shutting down the spiritual centers of the inner city when they need them the most is more sacrilegious than turning one into a gorgeous restaurant and repurposing the building.  I digress to an absurd degree...the gouda dip appetizer is to die for here.  I crave it often  it's that good.  The pizza is truly delicious, and the Pittsburgh salad with chicken and fries on top is so much better than one could ever imagine just by thinking about that combo.  I get it with ranch and use it sparingly because the chicken is so flavorful and juicy.  Really, nothing here is bad - I've had the pierogies in many of their various daily forms and could easily make meals out of them they're that good.  They're \"real\" pierogies.  Delicious.  The chicken wrap was equally delicious, though I'm not sure if it's still on the menu.  Everything is fresh and simply seasoned but still tastes very sophisticated.  I've never had a bad meal here.  The Pious Monk beer is a must.  A must!  But if you don't drink alcohol, try their birch beer or ginger ale.  They make it all right there.  The ice cream is so good - I don't remember what's special about it, they use something left over from the brewing process like the sugar or something, but this with one of their absolutely delicious cups of coffee is the perfect way to end your meal.  Amazing.  I hope you'll love it.  Another place I'd recommend without reservation to out of towners - when I bring friends home to PGH with me I take them there and no one's been disappointed.    Oh, the outdoor patio is wonderful!  It's intimate and comfortable.",

Better question is - how do you really screw up a steak sandwich?   Wife had a fish sandwich that I think had to be in their freezer since the day the place opened.   Hummus was actually decent and they served it with fresh flat-bread.    Just another sub-par Pittsburgh restaurant.    I will say that the Pizza that made its way past our table looked and smelled delicious - if i do go back, I would head straight for that!   I would also say that the dinner menu was a bit on the $$$$ side for food that could not hold up to your better dining experiences.  Proceed with caution!",

The space is gorgeous, high ceilings, organ, pipes, stained glass, etc.  This place has outdoor seating, however I always seem to forget.  It has delicious brick oven pizza, with fresh sauce, and perfectly cooked cheese.  I only wish their crust was thinner.  The wine selection sucks, but the spirits offered are pretty ample.  They won't offer samples of the cask conditioned, which is okay because all there beer is pretty good and they offer samples of all the rest.  The stout was below average.  I had their \"kobe\" steak sandwich, for $11,,, really?? \"kobe\"?? Either way, perfecty acceptable sandwich and the sweet potato fries are a nice touch.  Friend had the salmon, she said it was delicious and cooked perfectly.  We tried the brie, which was about c level brie with nice breading and figs (nice touch!), the non-traditional perogies were no good, overcooked, overpriced and underflavored.  The service was better than most.  The bathrooms were big enough, with no lines that I saw, which was surprising with so much beer being drunk,,, Oh well, I guess it's not possible for me to write a short review.

I've heard about Church Brew for some time and had not set out to eat here, but the restaurant we originally planned had closed. The setting is very nice. The food we had (pork tacos verdes and pierogie saute) was excellent. Unlike the station next to ours, Anthony did not explain the beer list, despite our question about a sampler offering we'd seen on the way to our table and questions about the beer selection. He did not take time with our questions and was inattentive after someone else delivered our food. He never refilled our drinks or offered refills or dessert. I noticed the table next to ours asked for a dessert menu and he delivered it without comment or highlighting and no order was placed. We are normally generous tippers, but Anthony got the minimum 15%. I write this for the purpose of constructive comment. All of this cost our Server and the restaurant money. The Server next to us, on the other hand (blonde/white-haired female) took time with each of the two tables we watched to go over the menu and specials in great detail and regularly followed up with her patrons for questions or refills, etc. She also brought the dessert menu and highlighted a couple items which resulted in an order. The food was excellent and although some light background music and a tad more light would have been nice, I will return with visitors, but Anthony needs a slight tune-up and he will be rewarded for his efforts.",

    "text": "A few familiy members were in town to see a Pirates day game and they had gone to the Church Brew Works last year and enjoyed it, so I joined them this year to grab a beer and small bite to eat before the game.  I hadn't been here in awhile since I had lived near Philly for the last 5 years, so I was looking forward to it.      The atmosphere is unique because you're drinking in an old church and because of all of the tanks of brewing beer throughout.  Mmmmmmm.  I had 2 seasonal drafts, Lavender Summer Ale and Ambrosia Ale.  Both beers weren't what I would normally care for because they were light and floral tasting with citrus notes, but on that particular day it was about 91 outside and muggy and they both hit the spot. Not too heavy and very refreshing.                                                    I ordered the Cajun Risotto Fritters for a quick bite and they were very good.  Crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside with chorizo and jack cheese.  They were served with Tabasco aioli which was a little spicy and just made me drink my beer a little quicker.  Not a bad thing.      We sat at the bar and our bartender was very knowledgeable and pleasant.  The only negative about our visit was that the hardwood floor near the bar was very sticky.  I don't know why since they had just opened for the day. Maybe someone forgot to clean it, but it was just a minor annoyance.",

    "text": "First impression, quite an awesome building.   I walked through the front doors of the church (flashbacks/guilt kicked in automatically) to a camera crew. Apparently the Food Network was filming some sort of show because of their pierogies (which is pretty cool).  It was a bit hectic inside so we decided to take advantage of the weather and sit in the courtyard.   The outdoor courtyard was nice and cozy. I have been in better ones but I have definitely been in worse ones.   Food: I got the a Mediterranean salad, although I was a bit hesitant because it was $16 with shrimp.  The old man was footing the bill so I went for it but was a bit underwhelmed when the salad came out.  For $16 I was excepting a Mediterranean island on my plate...but no. My sister got the pierogies which were decent.  They were a bit cold by the time I got to them which was my fault. My dad got a fish sandwich which was the best thing on the table. Crunchy, flakey, moist (eww)   Drinks: Solid beer list but I opted for wine tonight. It was a chilly night so I went with red. One glass of Cab Sav and one glass of Zinfandel. Delish.   Pros: Architecture, Great drink list, outdoor seating, nice but awkward waiter, changing specials  Cons: Strangely expensive for random items, cheesy plastic furniture on patio (really? you spend how much money on redoing the venue but you couldn't throw some wrought iron furniture into the mix), food took a bit but I think that was because of the Food Network event.   Overall: Will go back. I think I will just get some apps and focus more on drinking my meal.",

On a spur of the moment decision, my friend pulled the most illegal u-turn to pull into a side street while we went on a new adventure.   Inside, I couldn't decide if I was walking into Sunday mass (this also happened to be a Sunday that we went) or if it was a restaurant. All of the original stained glass windows are still in place, and where the alter used to be is where they now have all of their beer.   We sat at the bar and ordered a sampler platter of beer to try. It came on this cool place-mat with descriptions of each beer that we were drinking. The bartender was very nice and helped us with every question we could come up with.   The food was alright. Better than average I would say. But it seems like you don't come here for the food so much as you do the setting and for their beer. It was an awesome experience that I wish I get to experience again the next time I am in PA.   Plus, we got our picture taken for the local newspaper for a story on this place! Couldn't get any better than that! Definite recommendation in my book",

The red leaf side salad was tasty but over dressed and didn't come with the blue cheese the menu promised. The special pierogis of the night were not amazing because the butter added in unwelcome sweet flavor to the jalapeno, cheddar bacon yumminess. The beer was great and the interior of the place is fun. A large brewing system sits on the alter and is  quite beautiful. The reason the place did not get 5 stars is because honestly out service sucked and the fact that they use styrofoam to go containers. The waiter did not greet us, tell us specials or attend to us. At one point when we were finished (napkins on plates) for a few minutes waiting for the check he was in the corner watching the game.",

Everyone (8 people) liked his/her food. Brews were pretty good.   I would've given a four star,  but it was pretty hot in there and did have a slightly skunky smell. Not just from the brewing- more like beer spilled on floor and mopped up with dirty water. Not really bad, but a subtle scent that you'll catch every now and then. I guess if you drink enough brews, then you probably won't care :)  Next time I would probably sit outside.",

They brew the beer right up on the alter and the seats at the tables are made from the original pews!  As someone who grew up going to Catholic Church it was definitely a disconcerting experience at first to go into what looks like a Church to drink beer.  They brew their own beer and have several options you can try and you can get a sampler to try them all.  Their beer is good but not amazing.  The food is also good and they try to be really creative with things sometimes.  For example, last time I went I had rattlesnake and cactus pierogies which were on special!  That was my first time having rattlesnake and it was pretty tasty.  Their menu is a pretty eclectic assortment of things from Cajun to Italian (pizza, pasta) to traditional Pittsburgh items.  But it is a little on the pricey side for the quality of what you get.  Some of the portions are larger than others.",

This place is real cool on the inside.  They didn't even strip out the pews; they turned them into booths.  It was real cool.  First, we got a little (and when I say little, i mean little) appetizer of nontraditional pierogies.  They were buffalo chicken pierogies.  I think they were like $8 bucks or something, and there were only 4 little pierogies.  I mean they were delicious, but there were only four?  Kind of a rip off.  For our meal we got the pizza.  It was also great.  We got the plum tomato pizza, and the cook even added our request of mushrooms on it.  My only suggestion is that they should let you get different sizes of the pizza because we wanted to try two different kinds of pizza, but we couldn't because the pizzas only came in the one large size.    I would defiantly go back to this place to get another pizza.  I cannot wait until i am 21, so i can try their home brews.",

If you are in the Pittsburgh area you definitely have to check out the Church Brew Works. It is a beautiful restaurant. It is a redesigned church and they still use parts of the pews and kept some of the decorations. The best part is they replaced the alter with the brewery!   The food and beer was very good. I had the very large Cuban sandwich and it was one of the better cubans I have had outside of Key West. My friends had the bison burger which received rave reviews as well. Since it was a brewery I had to have the sampler. I was impressed with most of the beers. If all you like is commercial crap beer like Miller Lite or Budweiser, don't bother. Many of the beers are strong flavored. My personal favorite was the Chocolate Mint Stoudt.   The waiter was bad, and a bit arrogant, but the food was good enough that he did not ruin the score.

Cons: no smoking in the pub area (although I understand not wanting to damage the church with prolonged cig exposure), and a bit pricey for the quality of fare.

Come on.....the fries on top were fine, but the rubbery, melted mess of cheese covering SPROUTS (dear Lord, sprouts on a Pittsburgh salad?  Mon Dieu!).  The grilled shrimp were more like previously cooked, warmed up rubbery (again with the rubbery) things.    At my recommendation, my companion had the buffalo meatloaf which was dried out on top of dry mashed potatoes.  I used to CRAVE the buffalo meatloaf, dream about the moist, mushroomy wonders of it.  No more.  Even the bread was just boring sliced Italian....what happened to the wonderful multi-grain bread they used to make?    Apparently thiere is new management or a new kitchen staff.

As for the food, it is mediocre and a bit bland so would suggest passing on a meal there. If you are looking for a quiet spot too this might not be the place for you as the noise does echo throughout the building.",

    "text": "Voted Pittsburgh's best eatery many years in a row. This old Roman Catholic church turned brewery/restaurant had great ales and specialty brews, an extensive wine list, a huge vodka selection and the best menu in western Pennsylvania. The brick oven pizzas are incredible with imaginative toppings.  Try a sampling of all the beers including the bottled fresh Thundergod IPA, and the Pius monk dunkle. All of the stained glass windows are intact and all of the tables and bar stools were fabricated from the church pews. The outdoor patio area reminds me of eating outdoors in Germany. One is completely surrounded by red brick ivy covered walls. I've had friends from New York, Vancouver, and Toronto visit Pittsburgh and I've taken them here for dinner and they all had a great time. They also have said that the Church Brew Works is a one of a kind place and only Pittsburgh could pull it off.",

Church Brew Works is a very cool place with a lot of history. I love that the outside is unassuming and still looks like a church other than the sign in front. Inside is expansive and beautiful. The middle section has plenty of seating and there is a long bar along the left side. If we hadn't eaten right before going there, I would have loved to have tried the food but this trip it was exclusively drinks. The staff was friendly and no one looked at me like the crazy person I was as I looked around at the amazingly detailed art with my mouth agape the entire time. Beers were fresh and delicious and True to their descriptions. Definitely recommend this place to locals and visitors alike!",

    "text": "I went back to the CBW this weekend (after a rather long absence) for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. I'd heard they'd gotten progressively less nice in comparison to the other wonderful dining options now available in the area, however Kyle loves their beer and I was curious to go and see if they'd stepped up there game at all. I can now say I think the Lawrenceville competition has been rather good for them. Things that bothered me on my last visit when compared to the numerous great experiences I'd had previously weren't issues any longer.   The service was great from start to finish, unlike the rather awkward experience I had there before taking a break. I'd always loved coming to the CBW with out of town friends or on special occasions for slightly less greasy pub food, and in that aspect I think some of their menu changes are working well! The new chicken options are delicious, and the pulled pork looks way better than what I ordered last time. I went with the Maui chicken sandwich on this visit, and the massive slice of grilled pineapple was a nice touch. There are also some vegan dishes that seem promising.   For drinks we got the beer sampler on this trip, and it was such a great deal. Only the Christmas ale was lacking in character. The other seven beers were wonderful. I don't think I'll get anything other than the sampler in future honestly. I do hope the CBW continues in this promising way. It's such a fun place for visitors or on nights when I'm craving certain beers, and I'd hate to see it go downhill.",

Give us bruschetta, on tasty bread, and delicious basil pesto, as we ingest those made just for us. And deliver us some bread pudding, for thine is vanilla, the raisins, and the tasty forever. Amen.   For serious tho, best Pittsburgh salad ever. The breaded buffalo chicken was outstanding, filled with dark leafy greens, fresh sliced carrots and extra ranch on the side without even asking was a bonus.   My wife ordered the bruschetta and it was a showstopper. The bread was so good and through some black voodoo magic didn't get soggy the whole time even though it was covered in pesto, fresh ricotta and tomatoes. She also got jalapeno pierogis which aren't really my thing.   Finally the malted bread pudding with vanilla ice cream al a mode was a knockout punch.   Parking was easy and we got a spot by the front door. The atmosphere is super cool as its a beautiful old church that's been remodeled in such a way that it organically integrates the restaurant without feeling awkward. The server was good and attentive, also accommodating of our little munchkin who needed a spare plate and spoon.   I seldom give 5 stars to restaurants but this place earned it.",

We got there around 6 PM on a Friday night, just barely avoiding the rush. As you walk in, you are struck by the contrast of a bar in a church. It is exactly what it sounds like and it takes a moment to absorb that fact. The stained glass is gorgeous and gives the place an authentic gothic atmosphere.   We had gotten the house beer which was light and hoppy. I am not a huge beer fan but even then, I still appreciate the taste. Never tried pierogies, we had gotten the pierogi appetizer as well as a pierogi pizza. In his words, \"pizza has been ruined forever\".  The best part is that we were able to get free beer glasses by signing in on an app (I am blanking on the nape of the app but it is advertised on the tables). Definitely ask about it!",

I went back after a lackluster first experience (summed up by \"liked the beer, hated the food\"), I thought their menu looked great, and figured I'd try it again. To start, the service was awful. While FOUR hosts/servers chatted about their weekends, we waited about 10 minutes by the \"wait to be seated\" sign, until we finally flagged someone down. \"Oh, I thought someone already helped you\", they responded. Nope.  We met some friends for dinner, and ordered some beer. The waiter (a different individual from the four at the front) dropped his pen into my beer. And did not offer to replace it. I was not happy, but figured hey, it won't kill me...the beer was okay, not great. We'll blame it on the ink.  We ordered appetizers, bruschetta and a lentil mushroom ball. Both were very tasty! Our friends ordered sangria (delicious), and cask ale (also very good).   My husband got the shrimp and grits, which was smoky and creamy. I ordered a beet salad with roast chicken, and my friends got a cheese pizza we all shared. The chicken was RAW in the middle. I don't mean \"a little pink, could have been cooked more\" ... I mean could have still probably been revived by a skilled veterinarian. I sent it back. The waiter looked surprised and apologized. A manager came over and said \"the kitchen usually cooks the chicken all the way\"...well I hope so! He did not charge me for the raw chicken, though they did offer a replacement, which I declined.  Thankfully the pizza was good, so I didn't leave hungry.  They did not comp the beer, or offer anything other than a VERY halfhearted apology. I'm disappointed by the service, and incredibly disappointed by the food. Offering a customer raw chicken, without a reasonable recovery and very sincere gesture is pretty unforgivable.   I gave one additional star for our dinner companions' experience, which was decent, even though ours was awful.",

This place is huge with tons of bar and regular seating. Their rotating beers were good, we got 4 over our time there and enjoyed aspects of each one. They all had a unique aspect to them with different flavors and we really enjoyed that. The pricing for a beer was amazing but we are from the DC area!  The menu was large and things sounded good. We ordered perogies, the were only slight warmer than room temperature which was a huge disappointment. They were ok if they would have been heated properly, we wanted to experience a traditional dish and were let down. There was a huge amount of butter on the plate under them, not sure if that is traditional. The sauteed onions were also cold, the sour cream was served under them instead of on top/on the side for some reason.  What made it worse is that we were really early for dinner, only a few other tables were occupied when we ordered and a handful of people at the bar. Service was friendly but nothing special.   If I lived in the area I would go back for beer and the fun atmosphere but skip the food.",

It's artificially trendy and very overpriced. The food doesn't taste bad, but they could make it REAL.. like Pittsburgh.

We drove four hours and could NOT wait for our pierogie meal when we got to town. We brought family for their first time and they loved it too. I wish I had thought to take more pictures. The bread is soft and fresh. The hummus has just the right seasoning. The pierogies have no competition. Add in the ambiance and terrific staff, and you have to equation for a perfect night out.",

The service is fantastic even on super busy nights (this trip was a slower night). Try the cheesesteak (better than anything I had in Philly and I grew up in Delaware and lived there for 30 years). One tip is to expect a wait of 45-60 minutes on a normal busy night.",

Half off almost all the apps on the menu and a plethora of beer and wine specials. Drafts are constantly rotating so there's always something for everyone.   Our server was amazing, she was so pleasant and attentive to everything we asked for. Extremely knowledgeable about every menu item we could think of and had impeccable timing.   I don't think I've had better perogies in Pittsburgh. Full of flavor and cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and soft and steamy on the inside. Pepperoni and spinach rolls were also unbelievable. Get here now, don't let the altar and stained glass fool you. Amazing dining!",

The staff are friendly and do a good job but they did seem to drop a lot of things while I was there. The beer itself is good, not great. They offer a lot of European styles in every size you could ever need to be happy. Tasters, half pints, pints, large glasses are all options here as they want you to enjoy your beer in whatever volume you feel necessary. Parking can be a little tricky as there is a small lot out back that fills up and the streets are a tight squeeze.  Overall, this place is a must go to when in Pittsburgh but I wouldn't necessarily rush to go back. Check it out for the scenery.",

I did love the variety of their menu and their huge flights (8 brews- though mostly IPAs). I got perogies (which even the server admitted was just Mrs. T's), zucchini cakes (I was disappointed to see they were actually fried but just pan seared), and the French onion soup (which was my favorite part of the meal and something I would actually suggest ordering).  Food was higher priced for what you actually got. What really makes this place stand out is the architecture since they kept a lot of the original church workmanship. Worth going there just to see it.",

My husband and I arrived at opening so we basically had our pick of where to sit. We chose the bar in front of a beautiful stained glass window. We decided to share a flight of all their regular offerings (see what I did there?) and of their special brews.  The beer here was average, no one in particular made us crave a full pint. But the room is beautiful. I loved that most of their stills were on the alter, a sacred space if you will. Surprisingly, it wasn't loud when it got busier. Maybe it was because everyone automatically speaks in hushed tones in a church, or maybe they did some fantastic sound dampening.  We sadly won't be returning, but we do recommend it to people who have never been for the experience alone.",

Came on fri at 4:30 so expected lite crowd since early so I didnt understand why we were seated literally all the way in corner by bathroom door near exit when prob about 80 tables were vacant in huge dining hall.  The host was a young girl and dont know if it makes any difference in her thought process of seating guests who are willing to pay and help their business for her to get paid.  It was just 4 of us with no young kids and took a shower that day lol.  Asked to be moved to a booth near others.   Anyhow, we ordered pulled pork nachos, crab dip, pepproni rolls,.  All soooo good. Especially the crab dip chips were so good just not enough to eat all the dip. So we used nachos to dip in crab dip too.  Drinks were decent and best part those apps were decent price at happy hour. Then ordered lobster mac n cheese. Good choice! Filet mignon hmmm two from our table both said the meat was too soft like it was boiled.  One had medium and the other had medium well.  So reason for 3 stars is because of the host was either prejudiced or dont know service industry ettiquet,  service waiter was so slow and not pleasant, and $29 filet mignon was not worth it.  But happy hour apps and drinks were good enough to go back just for that.",

The nightlights of the meal were the beer, and one of my kid's meals (pepperoni roll). Kudos to waitress for letting us know that the fruit cup served with the kids meal was just a small Dole cup in syrup.  My buffalo burger was unseasoned, and the fries served with it were undercooked and soggy. My other daughter's dinner was $7 for two small chicken fingers and a small dish of applesauce (and drinks are not included- so her total meal was $9). The waitress was largely absent- I had to ask three times for my water to be refilled. We had to ask for silverware and napkins. The frozen peanut butter mouse pie/cake was a very small piece (smaller than I have seen in other reviews) for $7. No apparent manager walking around, and really, how do you say nearly every single aspect was subpar? They could really use some customer service training.",

The sheer size of the building is impressive for any brewery (it, being a very old, huge, catholic church and all), and it's not done too poorly on the inside.

Did I say available? Devin the server didn't even know what kind of beers were available and had to be goaded to go ask someone who knew. Really? Serving beer in a - brewery? That wasn't the worst of his issues, but it was the most humorous.  The food, meh. Uncarefully-prepared bar food at best, outshined by most food trucks (and I hate food trucks!).

They're definitely not your typical quesadillas. A bit of a kick to em.  This is the perfect place to go to if you're visiting!",

Not that there was anything wrong this go round I just feel like the gastro pub scene has really stepped up its game in the past few years and these guys have remained pretty much the same.  Worth a visit if your in town for a few days, if for nothing else than the photo op of the fermentation vessels in the alter!",

Some days the beer is fantastic and some days it sucks? I think NOT!    I think that the ups and downs noted are just a matter of individual taste . . . or perhaps, lack of.  I say . . .go try it for yourself.  The fact that it is a restaurant and brew works that has been put in an old church is worth the trip alone. Worth it just to see what can be done with a great old building and a little imagination.  Try the beer. Have lunch or dinner. See what you think. Don't let a few misguided souls scare you off.   I've usually found that when a place has so many reviews that are so across the board it is because some folks get out of their comfort zone . . . they begin to get uncomfortable when things deviate. Or when you put them in a church.  Well, I'm here to tell you that good food comes in all sorts of shapes & colors & flavors. Of course, so does bad,  But the one thing I know is that . . .  it can't be both.   Which review to believe?  None! Go try it for yourself!  So my vote is for 5 stars. I have never been disappointed in the food or the service . . . and by jove, the atmosphere is as close to heaven as you are going to get in a Brew Works!",

    "text": "Once we got over the fact that we were in a church-turned-brewery... the whole gimmick faded and we realized that this was a pretty sub-par restaurant.  First off, this two star rating is due to the food and service. I hesitated giving it a 3-star because the beers were pretty good. But we're in Pittsburgh and by default, good beers are expected.  - The waiter our group got was seriously one of the worst waiters I have ever gotten. The moment we sat down, our waiter came over and asked if we wanted anything to drink in a tone of \"I do not want to be here.\" We asked if he could have a moment to look at the menu because it was our first time and asked for one more menu. He walked over to a table with a cute couple and took the menu right off their table and gave it to me without asking the other couple if they were done with it. He then stormed off and didn't come back till way later. When we were ordering food, he gave us attitude for everything and was extremely rude. My friend asked a question and he answered with a sarcastic remark and walked to the next person, never bothering to actually wait or answer the question honestly. When we got our checks, he threw them onto our table. I was extremely annoyed by his attitude towards us, which started before we even spoke to him. I understand that you have bad days and just don't want to deal with anyone, but that is no way to act to someone who is trying their best not to anger you and now completely confused as to why you are treating them like crap. Anywho... rant over. Bleh.  - The pizza was alright. A little dry and not super unique. I felt like it was missing something in flavor. The portions were huge, however.  - I got two beers, the Rotating Stout (which is actually a light beer brewed with coffee and chocolate) and the Dunkel. The Rotating Stout was certainly unique, it didn't have the heavy, silky finish of real stouts, but had it's own unique, refreshing tart with aftertastes of coffee. The Dunkel was smooth and not super strong, again, a good beer to drink. Both beers were great and decently priced, but I would not come back just for the beers when there are other great beer places in Pittsburgh.  The only reason why I would come back is if I had run out of things to show visiting friends or they saw this on a flyer and HAD to see it. Otherwise, there are so many other unique, amazing things in Pittsburgh that I would love to show friends and family.  So luckily, I was in good company because the experience here would've been absolutely miserable.",

Who can forget the moment they survived an F5 tornado due to the sturdiness of a belt. I am 99% positive leather belt sales skyrocketed in the tornado alley region that year.   Who knew that the sometimes dastardly mother nature was also able to make an appearance within Pittsburgh itself? The Church Brew Works is a twister of dark Belgian flavors and delicious edibles making for a destructive good time in ones taste buds.  Like the dark clouds rolling in during a storm, the Church Brew Works has dim lighting which really works with it's church like atmosphere.  Last evening I tried the southwest wrap which really was a cyclone of flavor that dances along the roof of your mouth and slides into your stomach to make a splash of satisfaction. The sweet potato fries refuse to be bullied by its larger counterpart, the cyclone and make a bold statement of sweet goodness that will in fact explode on ones tongue as it creates fireworks of sensational prowess (Yes I said prowess).  But alas I bring you to the beer. The decision was made to try the seasonal due to the festivities that are afoot with Christmas. The Biere De Noel is a lightning storm of electric charged bolts that will pierce through the frowns of any person to find them joy despite their Grinch like nature. The only issue with this storm of a beer is that you will want more than you should have. A designated driver is recommended on this twister of a tale my friends.   In conclusion, twister is a great movie but more more importantly The Church Brew Works is the sequel. That is all.",

The service was incredibly slow and inattentive. I ordered a $20 \"speciality\" pizza (chicken & sun-dried tomatoes) and was extremely disappointed. It had no flavor. There was no sauce of any kind, the chicken wasn't seasoned, and the so-called sun dried tomatoes were dry and flavorless. After delivering the meals, the server never checked back. Our drinks were refilled as he handed out the checks. The only positive thing I have to say is the bread and garlic herb butter were tasty. Would never go back and quite frankly, wish I hadn't have gone in the first place.",

But the place smells terrible, it's really (really) loud. And there is no air conditioning. We were there on a hot night in June and it was very warm and stuffy, and humid as well. The ladies room was not very tidy, which is a pet peeve of mine. Anyway, our server was nice (Shane) and he was knowledgeable and helpful enough. They were out of my husband's favorite Church Brew Thunder Hop IPA which was a disappointment, but he enjoyed the recommended substitution. The appetizer we ordered was the lettuce wraps and it was fine. It had chicken chunks that were a little dry, so I didn't really enjoy it all that much.  My husband had the shrimp and grits, which he devoured, so I believe it was good. He said it was very spicy and tasty. I had the salmon with roast  pepper mashed potatoes and it was good as well. While the food was fine, it just wasn't great. I was expecting something really different or super tasty and this was not it. It was just average. This was the second time we tried to come to this restaurant and given the wait times (75-90 minutes!?) and the letdown of the shabby interior, bad smell, dirty facility and LOUD place, I was not impressed.",

First off, once again I tried several of their beers. Their rotating stout was a chocolate-mint and I found the mint flavor absolutely undesirable. I also tried a seasonal brown and was thoroughly disappointed. However, they did have a bottle-only IPA (the Thunderhop) that was drinkable. But once again, I would rate the beer  2 or 3 stars.  However, the food was absolutely phenomenal. We started with the hummus (good) and the spinach, feta, and smoked Gouda dip (phenomenal). Then for my lunch, I had, literally, the best French onion soup of my life. For anyone that makes it to the Church Brew Works I cannot say enough that you MUST TRY THE FRENCH ONION SOUP.  I also tried the nontraditional pierogies, which, were a green chile, cheddar and chorizo. These too were excellent.  So overall, the beer is a bust but the atmosphere and food make this place worth of a rating bump.",

    "text": "I've gone here a few times and have never had an excellent experience.  Let me get the pros out of the way first: 1. The building is very beautiful and interesting. It's worth going at least once just to experience it. 2. The variety of menu items is very good and the descriptions make everything sound delicious. 3. They have a nice selection of specialty pizzas, all of which are wonderful.  Although I enjoy some aspects of this place, I have quite a few issues with it: It's loud. Oh my is it loud. If it is even semi-busy, good luck trying to have a nice conversation at your table inside the restaurant. Every noise happening inside of the place echoes across the entire dining area. People talking, glasses clinking, forks and knives on plates, chairs sliding across the floor, everything. They do have a small outdoor section which is really nice for avoiding the insane amount of noise, but both times I've been seated out there, I feel like the waiter forgot about us for long periods of time. I know it is usually a busy place, but I've experienced far longer delays sitting outside than inside. Out of sight, out of mind I suppose.  The staff do seem pretty friendly and helpful when they come around, despite dealing with large quantities of people and orders during their shift. By the end of the night, as they're rushing around between tables and chairs, you can see it on some of their faces that they just want the insanity to end, but still greet you with a friendly smile when they come up to your table.  They rave about their food and beer, but in my opinion, it is definitely lacking. Everything is a bit pricey compared to other restaurants and nothing lives up to it's reputation. I did mention that the pizzas are delicious, they are, and they are almost worth the cost. Some of their beers are pretty tasty, but just not worth the cost. Nothing really blows me away here.  Groups. The place is pretty large and can easily accommodate a few large groups at a time. On my last visit, I went here with a group of 11 people for a work-related party. We called ahead to make a reservation and they told us that although they do not technically take reservations, they try to work it out so that when one group seems like they'll be leaving, they are ready to seat the next group. It doesn't work. If you're going to try and assume when one group is going to be done before they even get there, why not just take an actual reservation and set a specific time frame? We all arrived and were seated rather quickly, maybe a 10-15 minute wait only. We ordered a variety of pizzas and beers to share around the table. There were about 8 pizzas total and everybody had ordered 1-3 beers in the time we were there.  We were there for almost 2 hours in which the first hour was basically getting us seated, looking at the menu, ordering our food and beers, and waiting for it all to arrive. The next 40 minutes consisted of us consuming the pizza and some beer and having a general conversation and enjoying our time. We were just about to finish the last few slices of pizza and everybody had ordered one more beer when some well-dressed woman approached our table and told us to hurry ourselves because she had another group waiting for our table and that they had been waiting for 1 hour already. She then threw a stack of drink tickets (good for one free beer on our next visit) on the table for our trouble, and rushed away. We couldn't believe it. After the first hour of being seated, ordering our food, and finally getting it served, she had already expected us to be ready to leave because they had another group that wanted to sit. We were actively eating, drinking, and ordering more the entire time we were there, so it's not like we were just sitting there and wasting space.  As I said, we already tried to call and make a reservation, because that seems like the smartest thing to do, but they don't do reservations. They just expect to guess when a group will come in and be ready to leave and then basically push you out the door if their system doesn't work out. After that, we quickly gathered our things and left. Needless to say, I still have a stack of drink tickets on my desk that I haven't used yet. I don't know if I'll go back after that last time. I've never had a great experience when I've gone here and the last time really put the nail in the coffin.",

My girlfriend and I ordered the bison meatloaf and my buddy ordered the pork chop. My girlfriend thought the meatloaf was awesome, but my buddy didn't like his pork chop, based on his difficulty cutting into it, I could see why.   The ambiance is what did it for me. I had a quiet, relaxing, and peaceful dinner with a couple of my favorite people. I loved the stained glass and other decorative details in this old church.   To sum it all up, this is a case where I wished Yelp gave us to use of half stars. I'm reluctantly giving this place 4 stars, it's hard to ignore my buddy's experience with his pork chop.

We tried a flight of eight beers including a red, IPA, porter, sour and a Dunkelweizen and none of them really stood out, although I probably would have gotten a pint of the sour (by default) if it was later in the day.    Our pizza seemed undercooked and really saucy.  Every time one of us picked up a slice, it went limp and all the cheese slid off.  My French onion soup had a pig glob of cheese in the bottom and cheeseless croutons floating in oil on the top.  My side salad was OK, but pretty basic (at least it had romaine and not iceberg lettuce).   Five stars for the location, three for the beer and two for the food...",

So cool that it's a restaurant in an old church with original parts from the church. I thought the food was wonderful! However, 1 appetizer and 2 meals came out a little cold. We brought it to the waitress's attention and she notified the manager right away. The manager came over apologized, took my sister's meal off the bill and offered a free dessert! The customer service was great! I definitely will go back here!",

I wanted to say something but since I had a visitor, I decided not to.  For my meal, I got the pulled pork sandwich and it was super fatty and bland. Took forever to get silverware from the waitress too which should be standard?",

It was off-putting and had we not been seated outside, I would have requested that this happen because I could barely breathe. Has anyone else experienced this?  The food was decent. I got soup, and we also had wings and my husband got a burger. I believe we also got spinach artichoke dip too, which was pretty tasty. I had a bloody Mary, which was also good, but I'm just not sure what all the hype was about. Sure, the inside is neat, but it's mostly just an old building with a high ceiling. Sitting outside, it was decorated with the flags of different countries, which was a different touch.   Our waitress was good and explained the different kinds of peirogies they had. The ones I wanted (the peirogies of the day) were sold out. Dissapointing. I might give CBW another chance in the future, but it would take some convincing. Personally, I'd rather eat in a shack with outstanding food than in an old church with sub-par food, but that's just me. ;)",

We went during happy hour so half off appetizers was a bonus we got the spinach, feta and artichoke dip which was just mediocre nothing to brag about.   We got the Pierogie pizza with onions and it was delicious and service was fast. We took most of it home as we had no appetite. I didn't get a beer but their selection was huge and the atmosphere is so fun. My only complaint is having never been there we had to ask a person outside how we go in because it's not very clear being as its in a church but, I'd most definitely go back and try other yummy options I saw.",

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and even took home some souvenirs.  We are definite fans!    (Please ignore all the people who complained on this site, but didn't take the initiative to bring it to the attention of Church Brew Works so that they could rectify it immediately - the night we were there in September, the manager must have come by our table two or three times just to check on us - he was the one who actually took the initiative to get the musicians to play my guy a birthday song when I told him why we were there [his birthday] ... use your adult voices and say something next time you start to get that \"I'm not happy\" feeling - guaranteed a manager would want to fix the situation immediately.

    "text": "The Church Brew Works was the first restaurant I was taken to on my first visit to Pittsburgh.  I was immediately inspired by how the original structure was retrofitted to take on the functionality of a brewery/restaurant.  Actually, Pittsburgh does a fantastic job repurposing old and/or historic buildings into new, cool, or trendy sites - such as restaurants, bars, and apartments.  It is something that I love about this city.  Anyway, back to the Church Brew Works - very enjoyable experience.  It is a cool place to take out-of-towners, which explains why my friends saw fit to bring me there.  The atmosphere really does lend to the experience, with the brewing equipment placed at the altar adding to the fun.    Beer: I am tough to please when drinking beer as I have always leaned more toward cocktails, but an ice cold brew after a long day can be very refreshing.  My favorite beer here was the Celestial Gold, with a 4.0 ABV percentage, it goes down very easy and is light enough to enjoy with your meal.  If in season, it is never wrong to go with an Oktoberfest either.  Food: The pierogies - start with the pierogies.  The Traditional Pierogies will hand you a vintage Pittsburgh food experience, plus, anything sauteed in butter can't be bad - right?   My entree from my first visit to the restaurant is no longer on the menu, however I'd recommend the Church Brew Works for beer, appetizers, and atmosphere before moving on to other bars in Lawrenceville or elsewhere.  Though if you come across a chicken sausage sandwich on the menu, I would not pass it up - it is great!",

The local craft brews here are very tasty. I recommend the lagers, they are light and compliment the meal very well. I ordered the buffalo chicken pierogies and they are exactly as they sound! So good! Not too hot but they are def worth it. Once you are done eating be sure to walk around the church/brewery. There are lots of cool pictures to be had of all the fermenters up near all the stained glass art of Jesus. The one down side to this place is it gets kinda touristy.",

The seating is made up of pews and old chairs from a church, the stained glass windows are breathtaking, and they have the brewing equipment set up at the church alter. On top of the atmosphere, the beers were delicious. I am a fan of dark beer, and the two that I tried were great! My husband had the flight, and he really enjoyed it as well. The 7 onion soup was phenomenal, and the pierogies were pretty tasty. The pepperoni roll was a bit different, as it was deep fried, but despite the untraditional take on it, it was delicious. I would love to return here again when I am in Pittsburgh for my next visit to see family!",

I'm so glad she mentioned it, otherwise I may have never found this place hidden behind the old church exterior.   I had the cranberry mule, and my friend had some kind of specialty beer. Both drinks were perfect. We also ordered the pulled pork nachos, and beef brisket sandwich. The food was delicious as well. I would like to note that the nachos were extraordinarily delicious. They had this slight tropical twist to them with the sauce and the pineapples on them. I've never had nachos like such, but it complemented the dish beautifully.   The exterior is so deceiving... you would never guess there is a beautiful restaurant hall inside. I love how they kept most of the old church images and style while adding their own Pittsburgh twist with the brewers.  Also, I'm thankful for the parking lot behind the building. There is little parking on the street, and it saves the hassle of searching for parking.",

It's a lovely, open, repurposed church that is always busy.  The waits can be long, perhaps unbearable especially on the weekends.  This last stop we lucked out and scored a couple of seats at the bar.  At first we were sitting in the corner which isn't very comfortable or warm, but soon were able to move dead center and really have a great view of the institution and the people.   I prefer IPA's and their ThunderHop IPA definitely gets my stamp of approval on what a good IPA must contain.  Nice hop, great bitterness but without being too fruity.  I also like their Oktoberfest which they still had on tap.  The Christmas beers can be tricky sometimes they are just too spiced with cloves and whatnot but theirs isn't bad.  Definitely a good stop for a tasty beer.  I haven't tried their food yet but the venue is perfect for a small gathering of friends to sit eat and drink.  I would recommend reservations especially on the weekend.",

My pal got the salmon accompanied by polenta and some sort of chutney (I liked my meal more). The presentation was beautiful and the food tasted great! I wasn't as impressed with the beer selection though. I asked the waitress about the establishment and the beer and she couldn't answer my questions, but she was was attentive and friendly.

I don't know why they weren't prepared, but they weren't.  The server then explained they were out of all pizza, all pierogies, both soups and other stuff.  I thought that was a little ridiculous, but at least they still had beer.  The beer was actually the best part.  I tried a few of the craft beers that are brewed in-house.  Or should I say in-church?  I thought the beer was delicious and had a lot of flavor and variety.  It was very good.  After at least a 1/2 hour wait after ordering the food arrived.  I got a chicken pot pie.  It was chicken, fresh vegetables and gravy covered with a crust.  It was excellent.  The experience was as pleasant as it could be.

Our appetizers (pierogi of the day and risotto fritters) weren't that great so I wasn't expecting anything amazing from my dinner. I ordered the cranberry, turkey and brie sandwich. It did not disappoint! It's one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, but the fries were less than tasty.  Friends shared the southwest pizza and said it was so spicy it was inedible. Normally I would say it's too bad they ordered something spicy and it was too spicy, but the menu didn't even mention it being spicy or they wouldn't have ordered it! Other friend had the PGH style salad, about which she didn't have much to say and the boyfriend had the Cubano and said it was mediocre at best (surprising, as he loves Cubans and they're rarely bad).  The ambiance was awesome! I loved how evil it felt to eat in a one-time church that was used to brew and serve beer and spirits. It's really pretty inside, and has a nice feel.  The German-style beers I had were watery, too sweet or too lemony. Pretty disappointing considering since they're a brewery! Maybe I'm just too demanding, maybe I'm just like my father (couldn't help myself) when it comes to German-style beers.  Our server was so rushed that I felt badly for her. There should have been someone from management helping her with her tables. It was probably just an off night, but it was a little disappointing nonetheless.  If I lived in da Burgh, I'd probably come here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. I certainly won't make it a \"must eat\" place when I'm visiting.",

At first glance, it just looked like a run of the mill church. We almost walked clear past it until I saw the flags waiving with BREW on them. Immediately decided that this needed further inspection. Such an amazing/beautiful space. The beer was great. Didn't have a chance to try the food since we were still full from brunch, but if we make it back to Pittsburgh, we will definitely need to make a second stop.",

It is an old church and when you walk in the building has many of the old church features.  We ordered some beer which were really good.  (I would give the beer a four star!). The place was packed so service was really slow.  We got some fries to snack on while we waited for pizzas and sandwiches for 40 minutes.  My husbands chicken sausage sandwich was not good.  The pizzas are really big, with a thick bread-y crust.  I got the 5 cheese pizza.  It needed something.  Nothing special about the pizza. My friends got a chicken pizza which they said was fine.   I would definitely say this place is more a mediocre restaurant than a pub.  I'm glad I went to see what it was all about but won't be going back.  I liked fatheads on the south side much better!",

The casual but darn cool atmosphere of Church Brew Works was a pleasant surprise for us out-of-towners.  We couldn't stand the wait for the restaurant side but, turns out, the seat-yourself bar side had free tables, the same menu and table service.  Sweet!  I ordered the Pittsburgh salad - a salad with french fries which the natives said is a Pittsburgh thing.  It was tasty but not particularly interesting besides the fact that there were fries on it.  The cheese and potato perogies we ordered were yummy as well.  The service was very nice.  The food wasn't outstanding but it was a nice change from some chain restaurants and pretty good overall.  My friends and husband enjoyed the beer and I hear good things about the pizza.  We were there for a while and didn't feel any pressure to leave as long as we kept ordering a beer or two.",

We started at the bar, where we sampled some of the beers--the Celestial Gold, the the Cherry Quadzilla, and the Pious Monk Dunkel. All were fine, and there's something to be said for having a beer with Saints Patrick and Bridget watching over you...  For dinner, two of us got the price fixe menu, which included the Cajun risotto fritters as an appetizer. Now sometimes with PF setups, each component is a little smaller than the separate item on the full menu. Not here. Another of us had gotten the fritters separately, and there were just as many as in the PF menu. (And they were awesome--light, spicy, crunchy on the outside.)  For entrees, we had the strip steak, the seafood mac and cheese, the pork tenderloin, and plain buttered pasta for my nephew. We were served quickly and professionally, and my God, was the food good. And we were so stuffed that we had to bring home the desserts. (Malted bread pudding a la mode, and it was good for breakfast the next day!) Saints Michael and Margaret Mary were our guardians during dinner, and they approved.  It's not the cheapest place in Pittsburgh, but the food and atmosphere is worth every penny. The place was packed by the time we left, which is a good sign.",

    "text": "What a cool place to eat and drink!  My Pittsburgh trip was guided by Yelp, and I ended up at an old Catholic church.... ready to drink a lot of beer.  This website really is useful.  We showed up right in the thick of the Friday dinner rush and had a 30 minute wait.  Our server was very friendly and told us all about the beer and food menus.  If you are feeling like a sandwich instead of an entree, be sure ask for the pub menu.   I got the cuban sandwich, and my wife got the bbq sandwich.  Both were okay, but not great.  The beer was pretty much the same.  I got the hefeweizen (and later on a dunkel) and my wife got one of the beers on special.  Again, it was just okay.  Maybe it was just the night I went, but the beer wasn't that cold at all.  I know a little more than the average bear about beer, and that some beers are meant to be served at certain temperatures.... but it just seemed like it should have been served colder.  Again, maybe it's just me.... maybe I got there right as they tapped a new keg.  Maybe they poured my beer in a glass fresh out of the dishwasher.  I don't know.  The real appeal of this place is the structure housing it.  You sit there catching yourself looking up a lot of times during your meal.  I was struck wondering about the history of the place.  Not when it was built, or anything like that, but of all the weddings, baptisms and funerals had taken place here.  How many joyous and sad times.  So, to recap: Service - Very good, Food - OK, Beer - OK, Location - Great.  Recommend.  You gotta check it out at least once, but I'm not sure how often I would come here.",

    "text": "This place has to be home to the worst server in all of Pittsburgh. We were visiting friends in the city for the weekend and they wanted to take us here for lunch before our flight home Monday. The hostess was very sweet and sat us promptly, but it was over 10 minutes before a server came over... As one of us was making his way to ask the hostess about it, our sever came over and asked if we gave our drink order to someone yet. We told her no, that no one had come over yet. She apologized and told us there was a big bereavement party that had her behind. My wife ordered a beer of the beer menu the hostess gave us,  but our server said that wasn't their beer menu, took the menu away and gave us a piece of paper with a few beers on it, what?. After ordering our food and drinks at the same time our appetizers came before our drinks came, then she asked how our app was not even realizing she hadn't brought the drinks yet, then gave us an attitude when we asked. When our food came one of the orders was wrong, and she rolled her eyes at US because either her or the kitchen screwed up. We had to track her down several times for drink refills, and she was just miserable and unpleasant the whole time. When our bill came there was a meal on there we didn't order, we asked her to take it off and she said she couldn't because the managers were in a meeting. I suggested (previously working in restaurants) that she split the bill and put that one a tab by itself and have the manager delete it later, like if the table was getting split checks - she told me she couldn't because the tab was closed out. What?? How was it closed out if we hadn't paid yet? Unless she screwed up and did that by accident. We then explained we had a plane to catch so could she get this done and she said no, they were in a meeting - which wasn't too far from us. We then told her if it wasn't done in 5 minutes we would go into the meeting ourselves and talk to them. Low and behold - a few minutes later we finally had our correct check! We really enjoyed the ambiance of this place, the food was very good as well - but of you get sat with Jonalyn ask for another server! She was horrible.",

The perogies were pretty nice, well-filled and solid. I also really liked the spinach dip with smoked Gouda, as a shared appetizer.

When they're super busy which I've been there twice when it was it can get chaotic and the waiters lose track sometimes but working in food myself I understand how it happens. All the waiters I have dealt with always apologize if it happens and they're slacking. I've had their pizza a handful of times and I LOVE IT, great size for the price and tastes GREAT!  I was a little iffy on ever going in since it's basically a restaurant inside an old church but it doesn't give off that creep vibe. It's actually neat with the elements of the church they've left standing! If you're planning on going for lunch it's usually a little slower, if you go in for dinner I would say make a reservation because it can be dead one minute and packed the next with a line out into the hallway!",

This place has EVERYTHING going for it, all the ingredients for an awesome restaurant are there, and yet the Church Brew Works still completely fails.    Their beer is awful.  I know a thing or two about making beer and here it the thing:  You need to hire a brew master experienced enough to know WHEN beer is finished, and I can also tell that this beer is 'messed around with' too much during the brewing process.  get a better brew master, seriously.  NONE of these beers taste finished.  Not one.  At best, the IPA is kind of alright.  the rest of the beers just smell like urine, and they dont taste much better either.  oh--and the restaurant STINKS inside.  its the yeast they use for the beer, but it's off putting.  The last time I dined there, I ordered the meat loaf and it took forever to come to the table and when it did arrive, it was cold and it had sat so long in the kitchen that a skin had formed on the gravy.  Yuck.  our waiter was an asshole.  Very patronizing, to the point where I almost said something.   I WANT to like this place.  I really do.

Shrimp and Grits entree was so disappointing. $25 for a cold schmear of flavorless wallpaper paste with 8 shrimp plopped on top.

We waited about 10 minutes after being seated before anyone talked to us, but I think that was due to the hostess, since Brett came over to us immediately after seeing us then talking to her.   Beer was great (as it SHOULD have been, seeing this is a brewery) and the cocktail was fun. Seriously though, the highlight of a hundred buck dinner should NOT be the booze. Just sayin'!  Oh! And while the entrance is handicapped accessible, there are 6 stairs INSIDE the restrooms to get to the stalls. WTF?  Bottom line: Go somewhere else. Like Burgatory at Robins Crossing.",

It's really a very special setting with the old church, cooler than any beer venue I've been in before.  The three stars is for the food. My friend and I split the artichoke pizza which took about 45 minutes to arrive. Once it was finally brought over we were told that they only have one pizza oven, and since a lot of people had ordered pizzas that night it took extra long. Okay, so why not just tell people \"hey we only have one pizza oven so your pizza will take a while, is that cool or do you want to order something else?\". And then parts of the dough were still dough-y and undercooked. The rest was fine and I do love me some artichoke, but it was one of the more disappointing meals I've had in a while.",

And it's a good spot if you are trying to get your entire family into a restaurant, because you can make reservations, and the place is huge (also, there's a parking lot and ample street parking). But there is far better food in Pittsburgh. But look, if you're there--go out to the patio that it seems few people know about, get a pious monk dunkel, and the pierogi pizza. It will be a pleasant evening, and you can say you've been to church that week.",

    "text": "Forgive me Father, for I have sinned...I think.   Well, I'm not sure where sampling beers on a Sunday afternoon at a micro-brew located in a former Catholic church necessarily fits in the whole scheme of things, but I felt I was violating some type of rule, code or commandment. Regardless, Church Brew Works had been at the top of my Pittsburgh to-do list since I heard about it last summer and I was checking it out, regardless.  Since I've never tried their beer before, I decided to order the sampler, consisting of eight different 5oz brews for $12.75. But after doing some quick math, I realized I needed to address my growling stomach first to avoid any unintentional purge-atory (rim shot). After looking through the variety of menu options, I decided on the lunch version of the Garden Plum Tomato brick-oven pizza. Aside from being crispy and tasty, it turned out to be the perfect size for one person.  Anyway, back to the beer. Sorry. There were four year-round samples consisting of Celestial Gold, Pious Monk Dunkle (+), Blast Furnace Stout (+) and Pipe Organ Pale Ale. There were also four seasonal brews consisting of Red Nebyllek, Coffee Dunkel (+), Thunder Hop and Oktoberfest (+). It was a great mix of all different types: light, dark and everything in between.  Regarding the interior, I love how they've kept the original structure, including the pews, fixtures and woodwork, mostly the same. Plus, you can walk up center aisle, which divides two separate dining areas, to the front of the church where large, copper brew tanks sit on the front altar. It's sort of weird, yet cool, to see.  Spending lunch here was a fun and pleasant experience and I was glad to see so many other people \"congregating\" here as well. Okay, okay, I'm done.  (+) = liked",

The inside of the church is beautiful but the ambience feels weird to me. They don't play music (at least not while I've been there) and it really throws me off because I feel like I can hear everyone and everyone can hear me because of the acoustics of the building. Also, I just think some background music is crucial while you're out to eat--it sets the mood!   The service here is decent but it almost feels like a chain restaurant rather than a funky, local brewery. Last time I was there my server didn't know much about the beers, which I thought was weird. They do have good pizzas and the beer selection is good but I think everything is over-priced (probably due to the tourist-y factor.)   I've taken people from out of town there twice, hoping to show them a good time at a fun local spot but was disappointed each time and wished I had gone somewhere else. It's not awful, but definitely doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion.",

I really enjoyed their dunkel monk beer the best, it went perfectly with their tasty wood fired pizza! The Perogie of the day appetizer is a \"must\" order! Great spot to bring out of town guests for good beer and a tasty short variety menu of pizzas, sandwiches and salads. The only disappointment was there was no \"steak salad\" and that is an item I miss most from my old home, Pittsburgh... though they sell a Pittsburgh salad... their offering is with chicken and  the fries, of course! So close!! So, I ordered a steak, sold at a hefty price to try to make my own steak salad, it was very small, not worth the high price tag,. Oh well, I suggest you stick with pizza, it is very tasty, everyone agreed on that!  Service is great from the hostess to The servers! Our server was beyond helpful always checking on us and she even split our bill, can't wait to come back!",

Waiter tells me \"he isn't drunk, he is just an A-hole\".  Nice...  Anyway, another half hour passes this guy is so loud, we cannot carry on an conversation at our table. A few more F-bombs and more stories about him and his mommy issues and we call the manager over. I have kids here and there are are other tables with kids near by. He was not appropriate for children. not at all.  Manager comes over and does NOTHING. Yes, its sucks to be a manager on duty when stuff like this happens but you need to deal with it. Guy did nothing.  So, the 4 get up to leave and the tables around us all cheer and clap.   At this point,  the manager sends the waiter over to offer desert or beer on them. really didnt want to stay but the kids did so we ordered 2 deserts and i had a beer. get the bill and find out the manager meant 1 desert for the table.  So generous of him.  The manager on 12-26-16 working at 1pm needs fired. How is it fair to us to spend a whole lot of money to be miserable because he wont do is job.

    "text": "So, my review is not really indicative of the quality of the food, although if I were reviewing that, I'd probably give it like 2.5 stars. Thoroughly average fare, really. The beer is nice, but nothing to get too excited about. Moving on.  I ended up here with a party of 12, celebrating a co-worker's impending move to California. I ordered the grilled salmon with polenta, and it was ok. Again, nothing special, until I took my second bite of polenta and felt something crunch in my mouth. Since polenta is not supposed to be crunchy, I did a double take and took the crunchy thing out, rather than swallow it. This turned out to be an excellent decision because the crunchy thing was actually a piece of glass. Not only that, but when I cut into the middle of the polenta again (on the grounds of \"this merits further investigation\") I found *another* piece of glass! Right there in the middle! Not huge shards (about the size of my pinky nail) but big enough to cut internally if swallowed. My co-workers and friend that I was with were all witnesses to this.  I'll give CBW credit for handling this about the way you're supposed to: as soon as I told the waiter, he told the manager, who came over and was super apologetic. Obviously comped my meal (I got replacement food) and drinks, and offered me dessert to take home. That's great and all, but even greater would have been just not finding glass in my food. I can see a completely different scenario where I accidentally swallow it and have internal injuries, or even just cut up my mouth; that story doesn't end happily for anyone involved.  Most places you go, you don't expect this to happen. Doubly so for a place that charges $20 a plate. If that's the level of diligence that goes into food preparation at CBW, I don't think I could ever recommend it to anyone.",

I loved the Wild Boar Quesadillas and the Belgian Fries with that superyummy lemon-caper aioli.  My Chicken Madrid was excellent. The braised chicken came with sofrito, smoked pineapple, crispy polenta, and a salad of fennel, radish and celery. So good!!!   Darren and I both shared the Chocolate Mousse Cake and the Malted Bread Pudding with malted chocolate ice cream, and they were each amazing.   We never smelled anything funny. The interiors are huge and gorgeous and resemble a chatty dining hall.  If this place is a \"tourist trap\" (and I don't understand the debbie downer reviews it's been getting lately), I am trapped! I love Church Brew Works and recommend it a bunch.",

Not my favorite, but I love the attempt.   Beer prices are decent too.  I'd recommend coming in here and grabbing a drink or two at the bar.  There is one TV, but this is a more relaxed, family and/or dinner atmosphere.  The food is hit or miss.  The 7 onion soup is awesome, but at $4.50 a cup, it better be.  The pizza are pretty good, made in a wood fired oven.  The crust comes out doughy, but not too thick.  I had the chicken and chorizo pizza, it came out with huge chunks of chicken breast and a tiny dusting of the smallest pieces of chorizo I've ever seen.  The service was really slow all around here; took a while to get both drinks and food.  Far too long considering it wasn't even crowded when I visited.  Bottom Line: It's a cool place that warrants a visit. There are some good beers, but expect slow service.",

Everything else was disappointing. Our waiter lacked interest and personality; we asked him about products and his response and body language made it sound as though he didn't care for the food and drinks here (which should have been a sign). Our group tried 5 different beers and no one was impressed. The food wasn't any better. The \"Banh mi\" steak sandwich and the bison burger lacked flavor. The garden vegetable sandwich was the only thing good.   Overall, we're glad we saw the church but wish we wouldn't have wasted our money eating here.",

I had the Veggie Spaghetti and it was pretty standard with zucchini noodles with marinara sauce. However, the beer was wonderful. I am a big fan of Belgian Tripels and at the time of my visit one of the featured beers was Quadruple, which I honestly didn't know existed. It was called the Quadzilla and it packed a punch with around a 11% ABV. The flavor was delicious though and it was definitely something I would order again.

It's not bad, but it's also nothing to write home about.  I'd recommend Church Brew Works for drinks and apps/dessert.  If you're looking for a full meal, I'd definitely check out Hofbrauhaus in the South Side instead. As the name suggests, it's German food, but they also brew their beer in house, which gives you a similar interesting atmosphere to Church Brew Works.",

I ordered the soup and it was really good! Then when i wanted to get a different drink i asked her about it and she said she didn't try that one, and i asked about another one and she said she didn't know about that one either. We all looked at each other really confused, then she said she didn't know anything about the drinks because she didn't want to spend all her money there trying food and drinks. I've worked in restaurants and so had my mom and friend and usually you get to try a soup of the day, or you have feedback from other customers you've had regarding drinks if you haven't tried them yourself (especially the cocktails which don't change).

The building itself is gorgeous. Definitely would recommend it.   Note: not sure if this place has a handicap accessible restroom. The one I used was not.",

    "text": "I always imagined beer in heaven and church brew works isn't far off! This brewery is located inside an old Catholic Church on the east side of Pittsburgh. Inside drinkers and diners will find converted pews as tables, preserved stained glass, as well as an altar with a massive stainless steel brewery tank.  The most appealing aspect of this brewery is the aesthetics of the inside, the beer not so much. The brewery offers flights of their beer; however, visitors are not able to choose their beers and are given seven 5oz tasters of their brews. Despite the lack of selection, the flight is a great option at $14.50 with 7 beers to taste of approximately a two beer value. I tried their Porter which was weak and lacked flavor as well as their Cryowolf which was a solid IPA with a hint of sweetness at the end with a grapefruit/blueberry finish. Fulfill your weekend obligation and visit Church Brew Works!",

    "text": "This place has MICE!  I was in town for work and have always wanted to check out this place.  Walking in, the building is really cool.  That's about where my good experience ended.  The waiter took a little while to come to our table and generally didn't seem too happy to be there.  My girlfriend and I each ordered a beer, which neither of us really thought was that great.  We are from Cleveland, so we may just be spoiled with the number of great breweries we have locally.  The waiter took about 15 minutes to come back for our order, and again wasn't the most friendly.  He was serving a lot of tables, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  While waiting for our food, we spotted a MOUSE running around on the ground.  My girlfriend and I were grossed out, and wanted to tell our waiter to cancel our order so we could leave.  Only problem was that the waiter didn't come by our table again until our food came out about 20 minutes later. The entire time, we saw the mouse just running around the place and we were disgusted.  When the waiter finally did come over, we told him about the mouse and he said \"ohhh, I guess that makes it a church mouse!\" like it was some kind of joke.  He said they get into the barley in the back for making the beer.  From then on, all I could think about was mouse poop in my beer and food.  You know if you see one, there are probably TONS more MICE in that place and you know that mouse poop has to be mixed in with the hops and barley when they make the beer.  I was almost gagging on every bite of my cheesesteak that was not very good anyways.  I paid extra for the the sweet potato fries, which were soggy.  Even the pickle that came with my sandwich was soggy and didn't have a snap to it when you bit into it.   Overall, the building is cool, but the food, beer, and service was not good.  Also, the place has mice literally running around the restaurant and I think the health department needs to pay them a visit.",

Of course it has the coolness factor of being a converter church, but the food is pretty tasty too.   I suggest with going with one of the pizzas. They are large enough for 3 to share (10 slices - I think) and our favourite is the mushroom. Of course, they also have an amazing beer selection. If you can't decide (which I never can) try the beer sampler. Its HUGE (I think its like 8 sample as opposed to your usual five). My favourite out of the lot was the Christmas blend, which was gingery but not sweet.  Dont forget to take selfies of the giant stainless steel vats of beer at the \"altar\".",

(2) We didn't want to eat a real meal and the bar food we got was just okay. More like MEH. I would be willing to return with more/better stuff on tap and possibly to try a real meal.

Neither of us thought that the beers were that impressive. If I had to pick a favorite, it was the Pious Monk Dunkel but I didn't love it.

Since this was our first visit, we ordered the beer flight, which came with a healthy portion of 8 samplers, and I had my usual White Russian.  For dinner, I ordered the gluten free version of the Veggie Spaghetti, which came with sauteed mushrooms on top instead of the fried mushroom meatballs and was deemed very tasty even by my meat-and-potatoes-loving significant other despite the dish's ghastly healthified name.  I asked for a side of steamed broccoli, which the server offered to order on top of the Veggie Spaghetti dish as part of the gluten free substitution to avoid an additional charge.  My SO had the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich and fries.  The saucy and tender pork was delicious with the creamy coleslaw.  We loved the raucous atmosphere of the restaurant, and my German other half waxed poetic about the lederhosen-donning live polka band.  He said that this was exactly the type of restaurant you were likely to stumble into in Germany.  And even though the beer wasn't our favorite that we've had, we were impressed by the obvious quality of their process and the presentation.  The food is definitely several rungs above traditional bar food, both in taste and in plating.  Our friends' dishes looked tasty as well, the Buffalo Meatloaf in particular, which came piled on a bed of mashed potatoes and made us both a tad jealous.  I know what we'll have to try on our next visit.",

We were here the day of the Flyers/Penguins stadium series, and were told 45 minute wait but it only took 1/2 hour to be seated. Our server told us we just missed the huge crowd and came at a good time. We had high hopes, except we hardly saw him and he didn't check back to see what we needed. We didn't have silverware, plates, or the water we asked for. We sat so long waiting for our order, another server told us she would bring menus and take our order. I ordered rum, pineapple and grenadine which was great (some bartenders make it terrible) and only cost $5. RJ ordered rattlesnake pierogies which had good flavor except for the rattlesnake part. He liked them, but I thought the texture was gross, like a stringy refried bean. I had bison meatloaf which was fantastic. It was very juicy, I was afraid it would be dry. The potatoes and zucchini were cooked perfectly. RJ had roasted lamb which was full of fat, and very disappointing especially for the $30 price tag. The location in an old church is interesting, but doesn't make up for mediocre service or overpriced lamb that shouldn't be served with all that fat.",

When you walk in you're like \"woah it's a f***ing church\" and then the smell hit me. I am not a beer person so I don't know if the onsite brewing had anything to do with the smell but, even though it was faint, it wasn't a good smell. After sitting there, my party and I, eventually got use to the smell. The architecture of the building was all left the same, so it was neat to look at while you were waiting. Our service was good, no complaints there. He was informative and patient and helped my sister with beer selections. He was able to recommend one for her, since she doesn't like beer all that much. The wait for the food was a little long, considering there wasn't a lot of people dining at the time we where there. The pierogies I got were f***ing awesome - can't curse in a church (; The fries were really good as well, which I snagged from my dad's meal. Oh, if you come here you should know that all the beers are made there and you cannot find outside companies. However, they do have other spirits offered from the bar. I would definitely return.",

We entered the church around 2pm and it wasn't busy at all but we sat at the bar to do a flight. We sat there for about 8 minutes and it wasn't until an older couple sat next to us that someone served us who was annoyed about being a bartender that day and dude, I get it. I've been in the food industry myself for 8 years. Maybe they were short staffed and this person had to fill in, maybe they don't have a proper day bartender. But still, pretend like you want my money.  After a rushed flight, our bartender ignored us, asked the couple next to us if they wanted anything. They said no, ready for the check so the bartender preceded to then print our check, place it in front of us and then take away our empty glasses.   I guess we were done too? Worst service I've received in a long, long, long time. Being we had never been there before, it would of been nice if someone actually talked to us about the beer. The church is an experience. But customer service is also about experience and this place has not combined both of them.  Also, hella old people in there.",

    "text": "Church Brew Works is just cool.   I love these church converts into new and different uses. Takes a beautiful structure and breathes new life. Church Brew Works is a large, open hall of eating and drinking. And drinking many fine brews. I really love CBW beer, and often buy cases at local beer distributors.   So aside from the interior awesomeness of the church, there is ample outdoor seating that is just lovely in the nicer weather. Atmosphere-check.  The food is very good, but in my opinion a little pricy. The best deals are sandwiches or their wood fired pizzas. But still a couple things bother me. Like if you want sweet potato fries with your sandwich - its a $2 up-charge. But if you look at the prices on the side orders menu the price difference of regular fries to sweet potato fries is only $1.50. It just kinda makes it seem like they are trying to get more money from you than is justified by their own menu. Another example would be that the lunch serving and dinner serving of Jambalya are something like $8 in difference but the portion size does not change or is negligible. Just doesn't seem right.   Aside from the pricing everything I have has there is very good. A lot of good drinking food...hearty, and very often interesting.   Service is really good here. One time we had to wait before someone got to our table, and we were comped some drinks. I thought it was really good customer service, very appreciated.   This is a good place for large groups, also a good place to bring visitors who might appreciate good local beer.   Cheers!",

However, as beautiful as it is inside, I think they completely ruin the atmosphere with overly harsh lighting. I feel like I'm in a cafeteria, not a bar/restaurant. It would be so much lovelier if they had softer lighting and more candles in the tables, etc.",

Being new in town we were excited to try this place once we heard it used to be a church turned Brewery.    We sat at the bar and got the best service ever! Our bartender ( I don't remember her name but she was tall, skinny with straight blonde hair) was AMAZING!!! She happily pointed out some of her favorites and helped us guide our way through their menu.  We ordered their 5 cheese pizza and added Spinach and Pepperoni.  It was so good! I can't eat to much tomato sauce things so it was nice that it was a garlic and olive oil base.  We also ordered their side Caesar which had homemade dressing.  Yum Yum!  My partner ordered their beer sampler and I got the Moscow (Something...damn it I forgot the rest of the name.) But it was vodka, ginger beer and a little lime.  It was so good I'm going to try and make it at home.    All in all this place was yum yum good! And she even gave us some tips on places to go around town.    Great place, Great service and yum yum food!! I'm going to be back sooner than I'd like to admit!",

First off the pizza.  We had the southwestern, I think, and it was really good.  It had a great balance of sweetness and spice and was loaded with tasty veggies.  Now what we really came here for was the beer.  I went ahead and got a flight of 5 oz of all 8 of their offerings.  The three house beers were good, especially the dunkel, but nothing to go crazy about.  The IPA they had going was very good.  The other 4 beers they had were kind of different.  I can't say they were bad, but not something I could handle a lot of.  The had a Mole Stout that was pretty spicy on the lips, two spiced Christmas beers and barleywine.  All 4 packed a lot of flavor, and had their merits in smalls doses, but you'd have to really like them to have a full pint of any of those.  All around a great location with good food and lots of interesting and good beer.",

I love that they've re-purposed a \"de-commissioned\" church. I love the beers they make. Their staff, also, have consistently been great.  My issue is with the food prices. I cannot believe the outrageous prices they charge for the food, considering the type of food it is (mostly high-carb, basic comfort food and bar food) and the quality of it (just OK). Seems very mismatched, considering the quality and the genre of food. But, maybe you will disagree with me-- see if you can check for their menu and prices online before you go, if you are concerned about spending carefully (many people are, these days).  Definitely give this place a try-- the experience of being there is great, it makes for a unique evening (although noise is a problem for conversationalists, on nights when they happen to be crowded) and if you enjoy beer, those are certainly worth tasting. But if you're watching your money, consider eating at home before going here, and just going for drinks or for something small to eat and seeing friends. The food is not the draw, here-- at least it definitely was not the draw for me. In my world, bar food should be priced like bar food.",

The ceilings are so high and the whole floor plan is just open.  You can see every corner of the room and it's so inviting.  One tip a friend offered is to sit on the bar side to get beer specials and a cheaper menu.    We actually had a fairly large group so it was impossible to find seating for all of us at the bar on a Friday night around 8:30 pm.  Instead, the hostess accommodated us with a long family style table in the corner and we were still able to order off the bar menu!  I started off with the Pious Monk Dunkel, which was an exceptionally smooth and tasty lager.  I followed up with a spiced ale, which was surprisingly pleasant and fitting to the season.  Many of us tried the Buffalo Burger, which they all raved about and made us all wish we had ordered the same.  Love this place and hope to return to try some more brews and the Buffalo Burger!

    "text": "After starting a new job about 2 weeks ago, my supervisor thought it would be a good idea to go out for a bite to eat and a few beers, as part of my introduction to Pittsburgh and as a way to build some rapport outside of the office.  He suggested the Church Brew Works as the venue, with the caveat that he has found their beers to be rather uneven, their food to be suitable, and the location to be quite remarkable.  I had heard about the Church Brew Works before, and I was eager to try out this restaurant.  My supervisor was correct when it comes to the beer.  I had a pint of the Heavenly Hefe Weizen, which I found to be rather mediocre.  It was a bit watery for my taste, and there was a flavor I couldn't pick out that seemed a bit off.  For our second round, we chose the Pipe Organ Pale Ale.  This brew had an assertive hoppy essence that was quite enjoyable.  It was pleasantly bitter, and definitely the better of the two beers that I tried.  Compared to other pale ales, though, it was simply OK.  We split the Chicken & Chorizo Pizza, which was quite good.  The crust acquired a nice flavor in the brick oven and was crispy.  Toppings were fresh, although I found the grilled chicken to be underseasoned and the chorizo to be a bit bland as well.  I was expecting a spicier sausage.  On the whole, though, the pizza was good.  It was the perfect amount of food for two strapping young men to share.  At $15.50, I thought the price was fair for the amount and quality of food.  The real star at the Church Brew Works is the building.  It is clearly a unique setting, and it was a lot of fun to enjoy a few beers at this location.  For a Wednesday evening, it was quite busy so they have clearly built up a following.  I would certainly return, in search of a better beer from their selection.",

I don't think I have ever had to wait for a table, the food is high end bar food (I mean that in the nicest way) and is well portioned so you are always on the verge of finishing or having a small take-home, and the beers are great with an always available seasonal variety along with the regulars. They have a nice outdoor patio for the good weather seasons.   I guess the only thing that is inconsistent here are the servers - we have usually had above average servers but occasionaly you will get one that feels too busy and is just running the food around such that you may wait on drinks. That is how I would capture our most recent visit - sat in the bar area at a table and the server was friendly at first but eventually had trouble coming back to check on us very often.  Some cool things - they give you samples normally if you want to decide on a drink, and if you want to buy a growler to take home, these are a good deal because they allow for cheap future fill-ups on your next visit.",

    "text": "Just got back from Church Brew Works, as we had a pretty good experience. There were probably 40 people in the restaurant, but the sprawling size of the place makes it seem empty with that size crowd. It's a really cool space, between the brewing equipment and church relics, so there's a lot to look at and discuss. There's even lots of helpful info about the history of the place and beer brewing in the menu.  We started with the \"Nontraditional Pierogies\" (as opposed to the Traditional Pierogies) which change periodically; today they were stuffed with potato, chicken, andouille sausage, peppers, and pepper jack cheese (that I can remember) and DARN they were tasty, just needed a bit of salt though.  We also had fries with beer cheese. The fries themselves were okay, Potato Patch style but a little overdone. The beer cheese was pretty tasty as well.  For an entree we had the \"Cinco Formaggio\" (a name I find quite odd, since cinco is Spanish and formaggio is Italian...but I digress). The combination of cheeses plus pine nuts is mild and yet very yummy, the pine nuts add a nice crunch. The crust is heavenly, though I wish it had a teensy bit more salt and perhaps some butter or olive oil to moisten it a bit.  We also, of course, tried a couple beers, which were good in my book but I'm not by any means a beer connoisseur, so I can't do much describing other than to say I liked it.  Our server was very friendly and helpful -- checked on us enough times, refilled my water, all that good stuff. All in all we definitely enjoyed the meal and hope to come back for more soon!",

I may have eaten something else, but I was especially annoyed that we had to wait to be seated before being informed about the broken pizza oven.

This is a great one of a kind concept and is a brew pub set up in an old church. The service was prompt and we were seated right away. Im an IPA lover, and theirs is one of the smoothest IPA's I've ever had. We started off the meal with the regular pierogies appetizer. They were delicious. Kind of reminded me of a good quality tortilla the way the dough was crispy on the tops and topped with onions and sour cream. For my main course I had the buffalo meatloaf, and it was hands down the best meatloaf I've ever had. The meat was robust and flavorful and I don't know how they did it, but it seemed to have a grilled crust on the outside of each piece. It was amazing. The mashed potatoes were a bit strange in their texture, almost like grits, but still very good. The gravy was excellent as well. I highly recommend church brew works and will definitely be back here again especially since its right up the street!",

    "text": "Have you ever been to dinner in a palatial restaurant that was once a church?  Well, that's what you will find if you choose to have dinner at Church Brew Works.  Besides having good food, Church Brew Works brews, and serves its own beers. It's hard to believe that a building so vast could house a restaurant, but it does.  One of the first times I had dinner at Church Brew Works, I remember entering the parking lot and seeing something peculiar.  There were people standing in the parking lot, looking up.  A large collection of bats were circling the top of the church, hundreds of bats, it was creepy.  Maybe the bats knew something we didn't.   I had been there before, but my guests hadn't.  They weren't discouraged by the large gathering of bats, thank goodness.  When you first walk in the Church, it's as big as it looks from the outside.  There's a bar on the left hand side, seating on the right.  Up towards the center of the restaurant, there are additional seats, a pizza station, and even some old organ pipes. You have to try the beer if you come to Church Brew Works.  Some of the selections are, Celestial Gold, Pious Monk Dunkel (G.A.B.F. winner 1998, and 2001), Pipe Organ Pale Ale, Milennium Trippel, and many different types of Stout, all good.  Besides an excellent selection of fresh beers on tap, the bar also offers many different types of home-brewed bottled beers.  We all tried the stout of the week, and it was extremely hoppy and strong; very good. My favorite appetizer at the Church Brew Works is the Spinach, Feta, and Smoked Gouda Dip ($7.50) served with warm wood-fired flat bread.  It's really a great combination; the gouda and feta cheese are completely different in taste, as well as texture.  It's served hot, so be careful not to burn the roof of your mouth!  The Quesadilla is another favorite of mine ($9.00) filled with chicken, andouille sausage, jack cheese black beans, jalapeno and tomato salsa, served with cilantro sour cream.  The quesadilla is very crisp; it crunches into pieces when you take a bite.  The sausage, bean, and cheese are an unorthodox combination, but quite good.  There are many entrees to choose from.  There's a turkey and Watercress Salad ($11.00), Crab Cakes ($23.00) with potato corn hash, Bourbon and Brown Sugar Glazed Salmon with Spinach and Potato Mash ($17.50), and the Catch of the Day (market price).  Pot pies, steaks, and pork chops are also available.  The pizzas are great, be sure to try them.  My preferred pie is the Pittsburgh Pierogie Pizza ($13.50).  This pizza has potato puree, sauteed sweet onions, garlic, and cheddar cheese- yeah, you heard me, starch on top of starch!  If you're not looking to carb-load, go for the Chicken and Spinach Alfredo Pizza, or the Portobello Pesto Pizza. The menu is extensive.  Regardless of your culinary wishes, The Church Brew Works has something for you.  It's a great place to hang out during the week, and on the weekends.  It's a grand space, one that needs to be visited if you haven't yet.  And don't forget to try some of the house brewed specialties; they're delicious.",

My experience went quite smoothly however.  I went with four people, after our slightly confused looking hostess found us a seat, we were provided with great service.  The service was intelligent, but in a very scripted manner.  The beer was good, great compared to american craft and decent compared to european breweries.  The building is a lot of fun, huge renovated church with shiny stainless steel fermenting silos covering the side wall and the altar.  I chose the special for the night, which was rib-eye finished in the wood burning oven and a cranberry chutney.  It was good, charred on the outside, not overdone and a good cut of meat to begin with.  The prices are high for what you get though, meaning I wasn't stuffed after my meal.  Main Pro: Good local beer Main Con: The smell of the bar, not the fermentation, was fairly strong.",

In a city where the weather sucks ass half the year, its important for a place to have an inviting environment. Plus I'm a hardcore Cleveland Browns fan, and its always difficult to find a Pittsburgh location not completely saturated with Steeler shit and I.C. Light. Quite the turnoff!!! Its great to see that the Burgh has some class.   I was only here one time, yet it left a lasting impression. The church is gorgeous. I really appreciate the European mentality: saving the old building and keeping originality while updating and transforming the facility during restoration.   My friend and I split 2 wood fire pizzas. The Artichoke, Spinach, and Feta includes red onion, tomatoes, and parm as well. The Pittsburgh Pierogie blends potato puree, sauteed onions, garlic, and cheddar. Both pies had amazing flavor regardless of the fact that they used minimal amounts of each ingredient. The house brews were excellent too, as if that was ever a question!   I despise the usual Pittsburgh atmosphere, but the Church Brew plays redeemer and keeps me excited for my next visit.",

Plenty of other folks can go into the history of the building and you can get those details from them, I just want to rave about the food and the BEER.  Church Brew's beers are some of the first brewed-in-Pittsburgh selections we tried when we moved here and they're still among our favorites.  Especially fun is their stout, which is made a little differently each batch and usually features some special ingredients (gives you a great reason to try it every visit).  The food is wonderful and combined with the tasty brews and the unique atmosphere, it's no surprise that for lots of people this is one of those \"take anyone from out of town when they visit\" places.  In fact, some employers take interviewees there to show the place off as one of the cooler things about Pittsburgh.  The portions are *generous* so if two average-appetite folks want to make it from an appetizer through to dessert (especially with some beer) consider splitting an entree.  Definitely consider splitting dessert, especially if you order the bread pudding (our personal favorite).  Also, in addition to their more german-influenced dishes, the Church Brew Works offer some unique and tasty pizza pies.  It's worth noting that the pizza menu is served an hour after than the kitchen closes, so it's an excellent option for late dining.  If you've never been and you pass through the Pittsburgh area, don't miss this place!",

Like many other reviewers commented - the environment is pretty awesome. The food and service were pretty great--the meatloaf was delicious while the pierogies were only mediocre. Obviously there was a wide selection of self-brewed beers available. While portions were large the food and brews were a bit on the expensive side. Fair warning: When we went they were brewing something and the place had a definite hopps and cabbage smell...a smell that remained on us for a good 2-3 days. Nonetheless I'd recommend this place to anyone in Pittsburgh.",

When the hotel shuttle pulled up, bf didn't notice the sign on the corner and said \"Are you sure this is really a restaurant?\"  It was busy inside, but we were able to get a seat at the long, winding bar. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but the bf makes up for that.  His favorite pour was the Xtreme Thunder Hops.  I took a taste and it was so hoppy, it felt like an assault on my tongue, but he likes that kind of thing. I had a glass of wine and the Cajun Risotto Fritters appetizer. Wow, they were great.  Altho I will say that considering they're just little fried rice balls...$8 for 5 or 6 of them is a little steep.  Due to the church interior, it can get very loud inside, with voices bouncing off all the walls.  I just loved the interior of the building. Just a gorgeous place. Our bartender was a sweetie and we met some nice people to talk to at the bar.  I'll definitely go back.",

    "text": "Very cool idea repurposing the church building into a brewery. Went with a group of 5 and everyone liked their drink. Had the beer sample flight, which was fun. It allows you to try their more popular beers before deciding on one to commit to. People in my group liked it. I'm not a beer fan, so I had a mango sangria, which was tasty. They do have a good number of non-beer choices for those who aren't beer fans. We also got two pizzas that were pretty scrumptious.   The good food/drink and the unique atmosphere make it somewhere worth checking out. I'm pretty sure this will be one of the places that I will be bringing friends visiting me in Pittsburgh.",

I would say that their steak sandwich made with Kobe beef is one of the better (though not best) steak sandwiches I have had.    It is amplified even more when combined with one of their beers (more on that later).       The second item I am a big fan of is the pulled pork sandwich, the sauce on this sandwich is house made using their Pios Monk Dunkel.   I just had this when I was here last week for the first time and I will definitely be back.    Alright....so really the thing that puts this place up on the list....beer....in a converted Catholic Church.   I know it's a gimmick....but it works...and the beer is great, I have historically been a fan of their seasonal stouts, or if you are looking for a consistent beer always on the menu check out the Dunkel.",

As noted before, the flower beds are weedy, plants/trees need pruned, trimmed and cut down, the back parking lot is just a mess.  While I used to consider this a \"show place\" for new people coming into town, I no longer do.  It is, from the outside, shoddy.   Inside, it maintains itself okay but on the last two visits, the service staff seemed distracted and focused on working the tip -- and not particularly knowledgeable about the craft beers on the menu.  Place feels like it is coasting now.  Meh. I've experience better.  Indeed, for a GREAT experience, go to East End Brewing --- service is fantastic, beers are great (easily beyond CBW), and they continue to evolve.   Sorry for the comparison but it is what it is.  CBW is off the \"show me something of Pittsburgh\" list now.  f8 and be there.",

I've only been there a few times to take my visiting friends there and it's a fun experience for them. I'm not sure about my friends, but honestly, I can't say that I've ever had an amazing meal there. It's not terrible by any means, but I never leave thinking, \"I have to come back, like tomorrow.\" However, the beer selection is it's highest point for sure. I have always been extremely satisfied with the different brews I try every time.  The service is good, and the employees have always been knowledgeable of their menu and beer selection, and have always been very speedy with their service. There is a somewhat limited parking lot behind the building. I've never had trouble getting a spot but on it's busiest nights it might be a hassle?  Overall, you must go at least once! But I probably won't be convincing myself to go anytime soon.",

We ordered the perogi's to start off, they tasted like the frozen ones you get at the grocery store. Two of us ordered the wood fire oven pizza, both were horrible. no taste at all.

    "text": "I always enjoy my visits here. The interior is simply stunning and spectacular with the significant features of the original church (including the giant wooden doors), still intact despite its conversion to a brew pub. Brewing equipment is beautifully displayed in what was the alter area. Oews were replaced by tables, chairs, high tops, stools and a bar. The center aisle divides the traditional dining and bar areas. In contrast to the inside, the outside courtyard-style patio is subdued and relaxing on a nice evening. Service is always good, even for larger groups. I've found all of the food to be reliably decent and the specials are often a good call if something on that first page of the menu jumps out at you. Some beers are better than others and recently I found the cleverly named Pittsburgh Post Grissette to be a nice summery beer without having too much of a fruity taste. The fact that their website isn't updated with the current draft list is a little annoying though. A quinoa salad special proved to be awesome. A coconut chicken special featured delicious golden brown chicken, though the jalapeno couscous was disappointing as it didn't have even the slightest bit of kick and likewise the pineapple salsa was little more than tiny chunks of pineapple. The fact that they feature Dave & Andy's Homemade Ice Cream is a reason to always save room for dessert. Another disappointing thing on a recent visit is that we were looking forward to food with recently foraged Chantarelle mushrooms as the restaurant just sent out an email on the topic the day prior. There were no menu items that included this fungus, but our water was very helpful, looked into it and said that the kitchen was still doing a shrimp pasta that had a sauce with the Chantarelles in it. The dish was delicious, but lacked any taste of these seasonal shrooms.",

Love the stained glass windows, the beer garten quality it has to it. Just a unique place overall. Their waitstaff was attentive although a little clumsy when pouring water, but whatever. The only thing I really cared about is that they didin't spill my drink. I ended  up ordering their beer flight which will definitely leave you toasty.   For my entree I ordered the Heirloom Tomato salad with I big honkin' piece of salmon, which was perfectly cooked. Their dressing was just perfect with this combination. My husband ordered their cheese pizza which was absolutely huge, so be prepared for left overs. Oh and for appetizers we had their peroguies which were pretty solid.   I'll definetely be back!!",

I had a feeling it was going to be a smaller entree, so I went ahead and ordered a side of fries to get started. I should have asked first, but I didn't, and go figure, the fries are frozen (ie, not hand-cut). Personally, I feel, restaurants at this price range should be serving hand-cut fries standard. They do have Frank's hot sauce though, which is a plus always. I did not have any beer this day, so this review is only for the food.

The bartender initially was sort of a douche.  Either he confuses rudeness with having a personality or he was nearing the end of his shift and just DGF and it fails to reflect well on the establishment.  The girl that took over for him 20 minutes later was much more personable.  A couple of tasty beers here but fewer than other breweries in this town.    What is really absurd is that the bar-keeps I talked to completely agree that the beers suck, but the place opts to serve the shit rather than dump it and just brew something better.    Tried a beer sampler.  Four regular beers and four seasonals.  I liked the Celestial gold, and the Pipe Organ Pale Ale  The thunderstyle(i think that was the name?) IPA, some licorice mint concoction (sucked), the early summer brew \"confessional kolsch\" (again, i think that was the name) were not my cup of tea.    Behind the bar was a mess.  Wet floors, a clusterfuck of tangled hoses, multiple Dish/glass racks stacks all over the place, wet floors, dusty display of glasses....just a general unsanitary/under-managed feel. That made me & my bro think things like the kitchen....which we cannot see....would only be worse off.  Eff-it, we wound up ordering a little food. Very little food.  Spinach-feta-gouda dip.

They always seem to be in a generally bad mood, and extremely bothered at any simple request like getting me another beer!  I'm sorry I thought that was the main part of your job.  Anyway, I would probably never come back here if the beer wasn't as good as it is and if I wasn't a beer enthusiast, simply because of the terrible service.",

Depending on the time of day, you may get a strong yeast smell which doesn't make everyone in your party happy.  -I got the sampler of course, not much to say all the beers were good none stood out as AMAZING.  I actually preferred their pale ale over their IPA. But the sampler is worth trying.  -The pizza is fantastic, I've been twice and both times enjoyed it very much.  -All in all if you are in the area check this place out, it's got good food, good beer and just the scenery is fantastic",

Now on to the beer, many of them were very good and many were not. Beer is certainly all about personal preference so I won't cloud your head with my judgement. I do suggest that you try the sampler because you get to try around 8-10 beers and then focus on your favorites after that. The Food...certainly not the area where they shine in my opinion. I tried a few bites of pizza and while it was spicy (which is nice), it was mushy and just pretty bad overall. I had the Pierogi Saute for my meal and I enjoyed the pierogies but the sauce and other added elements missed the mark a bit and didn't really add anything to the dish. Definitely a spot worth checking out because it's  a cool space, but maybe eat before you go and just plan to sample the beer.",

As for the entree- I am having the soecialnof a 10oz pork chop- it's ok and I could use a serrated knife to cut though. The mashed potatoes I shared to see what the flavor was and we all agreed the sour Flavor of the taters was peculiar - well the goat cheese I did not want on my pork chop was whipped into the mashed potatoes!  Hello- potatoes do not need assaulted w goat cheese! All in all, two types of pierogi tried by our group were good.  Salmon was run of the mill. Braised short ribs were good.  Pork chop Was good minus the mashed taters.  Cappuccino is from a machine like at a gas station(as warned by the waitress). Had reg coffee and desert.  Coffee was ...good!  $100 bill plus tip for two and I wished I'd gone elsewhere.    Atmosphere extremely loud but neat to see the reinvention of an old Catholic Church into a brewery!",

    "text": "The atmosphere gets a 5. Visitors love it here because it's literally an old church, and they have *barely* changed things to make it into a restaurant and bar. They still have pews and an alter and stained glass. Plus, the vibe is great. Very laid back and friendly. Beer flowing.  However, it's hard to review Church with a single rating because it's two different things...well, almost three: a brewery, a bar, and a restaurant.  The brewery (4/5) Church brews a bunch of beer, and they are all quite good. Two of my favorites are the Millennium Trippel and the Ambrosia Ale. When they are pouring these two, I rush over because they rock. The Ambrosia tastes like beer plus champagne. Seriously. You must try it. If you like a Belgian, the Trippel is awesome. Plus, it's pretty high ABV so you'll feel mighty nice after drinking it.  The bar (4/5) The bar area (the LEFT side) is a little chaotic because it's first come, first served. On Friday and Saturday nights and game nights, there are very few seats and it can be a long wait to get food. However, given the proximity to the beer, you get faster beer delivery. Also, the primary menu over here is the \"Bar\" menu, and I personally prefer this menu. It's got your typical bar food, like the wings or the fries or the hummus, and they do good bar food! If you eat pizza, get a pizza. Their pizzas are great and huge!  The restaurant (2/5) This side is a good place to go if you need to bring the kiddos. While you get your food much faster, it can take forever to get a beer. One time we didn't even get our beer! If you side on the RIGHT side, you must ask for the bar menu. The salads and entrees are okay, but there are much better places to get this type of food. Unless you really need a salad, stick to the bar food.",

It was amusing to walk into the 'church' to find the microbrewery situated on the altar, the pews converted to seats for dining, religious-esque stained glass windows, and national flags hung below the organ.  We arrived there on a Saturday evening with no trouble getting a table indoors (they have a patio outside as well).  Service was fast.  I had the \"Pious Monk Dunkel\" that was pretty easy to drink for a dark beer.  My company had the \"Coconut Stout.  While I'm not a big fan of stout, that one was somewhat easy to drink.  We shared the watermelon cerviche, which was somewhat bland and not the best quality seafood used, but then I had the brown sugar glazed salmon with spinach and sweet potato mash that was pretty decent.  This place is known for their pierogies, so we also got that.  It was good but maybe a tad too much cream and butter.  Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience.  Out-of-towners should certainly give this place a go.",

I always take out of towners here because it is such a unique space.  The beer isn't bad either.  I love my agnostic mother's comment, the first time she walked in the place - \"This is beautiful.

Next I had the Oktoberfest, which I'm pretty sure I could have drank many, many pints of, but I stopped myself after one.   Now, to the food. The pierogies were a bit too greasy and not as flavor-filled as I've had them (we tried both the traditional and \"untraditional\" which on that day were bratwurst and sauerkraut filled). We also shared the risotto lollipops which were very nice (the sauce was the highlight) and the sweet potato fries which were nothing too spectacular.   But oh, OHHH, the main course. I got the smoked pork chop with the beet BBQ sauce of the Oktoberfest menu, and it was memorable. The sweet sauce and the perfectly smoked chop were an amazing combination. The spaetzle and sauerkraut were exactly what the dish needed to balance out and the portions were very generous.   Dessert we shared German chocolate cake, pumpkin bread pudding, and black forest cheese cake - all were wonderfully done. I really enjoyed the flavor of the bread pudding, very warm and homey, and the texture of the cheesecake was perfectly light thanks to the ricotta cheese.   I wish I could give this 4.5 stars, because the appetizers were just an OK-start to what turned into a fabulously memorable meal in a fun atmosphere that I will suggest anyone passing through Pittsburgh check out. I'd gladly return (hopefully in the fall so I can get some more Oktoberfest brew...)",

The food all sounded good, but we didn't try any.  If I'm in the area again I may come back to see if they have any different seasonal brews, and maybe try the food, but based on what I've seen so far I don't have particularly high expectations.",

    "text": "When I lived in Iowa, I would come to Pittsburgh to visit my girlfriend. One of the first places we went out to eat was here. We got a pizza and a microbrew and both were simply amazing. I flew back home reminiscing about the perfect crust, the chewy and substantial cheese and the sauce which exploded with flavor.   Since then, my girlfriend (now wife) have come back numerous times. Only problem: we can't remember what it was we ordered that first night. By now, we have tried virtually everything on the pizza menu, and all are very good--well above average--but we have yet to have a repeat of that first experience. Perhaps it was just the magic of budding romance that made everything taste so good.   At any rate, we bring out of town friends here often since the space is so neat--high ceilings and pipe organs towering next to glossy stills. The beers are complex and classy--a must try.",

My nieces had the pierogis and they said they liked them, but they didn't look impressive or homemade to me. And the food is not cheap--you're paying high-end pub food prices. I probably will not return for food.",

The beer was good.  We got one German style beer and one American style brew with 3 types of hops.  Both were great.  We split the tuna appetizer (4 stars) and the black bean soup with cilantro sour cream (4 stars) and a salmon salad (4 stars).   So why three stars?  Over priced for what you get - luckily we were not too hungry our we would have left craving more.  Also, the service was so so at best and the food took more time than usual.   I didn't really like the environment of the outdoor seating either.   Overall, I would return but have mixed feelings about the reputation this place has been able to build for itself.",

It's a cool concept, but I can see how it could have gone horribly wrong and been really cheesy - thankfully, this is not the case at all.  I absolutely love the feel of the restaurant, especially the stained glass.  The servers are knowledgeable about their beers and happy to offer suggestions (I went with the excellent Celestial Gold).  We started out with pierogies, which were nothing short of phenomenal - order them, they are a life-changing level of good.  I also had the Shinkasa cheesesteak (Kobe beef, grilled onions and red peppers, and melted provolone), which was quite tasty.  All around a fantastic experience!",

With a pizza oven and a brewery near the old altar, it almost feels sacrilegious eating there.  But in a good way.    Food wise, The Church Works is pretty good, with large portions, and a big and diverse menu.  Their pizza is probably their best dish.   If you're ever in Pittsburgh, definitely stop by, as it's one of the few places I've encountered where you can sin and eat at the same time.",

    "text": "A disappointing and Dog-Unfriendly place  After a 400 mile dog friendly trip, I was greatly disappointed to come to downtown Pittsburgh for my second visit to the Church Brew Works.  As a lover of beer, this place was a treat on my past visit.  This trip was different, as this time I was traveling with my four legged companion, a 10 year old and gentle cattle dog.  I was excited to see in an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,   \"No doggie bag needed\" the below was quoted by the owner of the Church Brew Works \"Hey, do we ever have dogs on the patio?\" Sean Casey, proprietor of the Church Brew Works, called out to a staffer when contacted by phone. Turns out they have, for the past two years.  Driving up on the overcrowded facility, I could tell it had changed from the last time I was there when it was a quaint and nearly vacant place to enjoy a beer.  I went in while my girlfriend and pooch waited outside. I kindly asked if the \"rumor that the beer garden was pet friendly\" was True and quicker than a dog, the wait staff barked back \"NO IT IS NOT\"  I get it, a policy change, but for someone that had planned a long road trip with this place being the highlight, a barking waitress was not appreciated.   Many dog-friendly websites list the Church Brew Works as being pet friendly, and the internet makes it hard to control fact from fiction, but here in a print newspaper, the place is listed as pet friendly.  If you change your mind... That's your choice, but train your staff to offer pet friendly alternatives... Heck, take it a few steps further, first Google your place and \"pet friendly\" and work on changing the report to \"no pets allowed\" 2nd Why not be proactive and put \"sorry no pets\" and 3rd why not do something really customer service friendly... How about find other proprietors that are pet friendly, print them out and hand them to potential guests instead of slamming the door on them and sending them away... Doing these things keeps customers instead of alienating them.  I have to give props to someone who got it right ... Atria's Restaurant by PNC Park.   They welcomed poochie in, gave her a huge bowl of water, and catered to us as we set outside and enjoyed beer.  They were not even listed as \"pet friendly\" That is why they got my vote and a great tip, and Church Brew Works... Well I think Iron City could do a better job at making beer then you... At least their beer is Union Made with love instead of served by cocky short tempered door guards for wait-staff!",

This time we went at about 4:00 PM on a Saturday. The restaurant was only about 2/3's full. The first thing we noticed was everything from the front doors, to the chandeliers, to the bathrooms, were very dusty, dirty and dingy. There were spider webs hanging from the ceiling in the dining room. We were almost afraid to eat there.       My wife's appetizer came out 10 minutes after mine and was over cooked. Our dinners were overall well below average for the price. Our favorite entrees were definitely not the same. The flavors were not what they were before and the portion size was too small.     The bar tender was drinking beer behind the bar which seemed very unprofessional. It seems like this restaurant is under new management and they have lost their good chefs. I think the owner needs to watch \"Bar Rescue\" on Spike, because this place is in trouble.",

I've currently had only 6 of Church Brew Works beers, but they've so far been very underwhelming.  I will keep trying in the hopes that I can find a winner and bump up the star rating.  On that note, I don't think I'll ever be back for the food.  My table of 7 started with a pizza...and probably should have stopped there.  One friend got a steak hoagie that was basically salt-crusted, another got jambalaya that was oversalted and inedible, my girlfriend got a sandwich that was average at best, I got an overcooked buffalo burger...you get the idea.  And it's definitely not cheap; for Pittsburgh it's more on the expensive side.    If you go, ask someone what the best beer on tap is, give it a go, and get a pizza.  Skip the regular menu.",

Our waitress was quite attentive, checking in with us regularly and providing refills of water without prompting.  It was quite busy but being a Saturday night, that was not surprising.

I sat at the bar and had some spinach and artichoke dip, 2 slices of pizza and a sampler of their beers.  By far my favorite brew was the Tripple.  Nothing else really stood out.  They had another section for more formal dining.  I was wearing jeans and dressed casually but I didn't feel out of place in the bar.  The staff was not very friendly and the bartender spent more time talking to coworkers than helping people.

Church Brew Works & Restaurant is an amazing place. I suggest checking out the website to really see what this place looks like.  It is sorta like a beerhall inside and they have an outdoor courtyard in the back which is equally beauteous. They brew lots of yummy beer and the munchies are primarily German influenced.  Eating pierogies and drinking big glasses of beer was just like heaven. The only sin was this flavored creme brulee, which tasted burnt and just awful.

As a recovering Catholic and beer lover, I LOVED everything about the venue. They left so much of the old church intact, from the holy water fonts to the stained glass to the light fixtures, and even used pews as the benches. The brewing equipment (well, some of it, anyway) was up in the altar area. Some people might see that as sacrilegious, but i thought it was fantastic.  I'll be honest, I wasn't thrilled with the trippel I ordered (it was a little too sweet and bubbly), but my friend's stout was really good. I brought a six pack of the dunkel home for my boyfriend, who is a brewer himself, and he likes it.  For dinner, my friend had the pot pie, which I tried and loved, and I had the crab cakes, which were also good.   Definitely check this place out if you're in Pittsburgh!",

Beer and meal were OK. We had an order of pierogies for an appetizer, which was the highlight of my time there. The service was great. Overall, the experience was a C+-- I think I would be more inclined to try a new restaurant than come back, but certainly no one would have to twist my arm for a reappearance. I definitely think a fun crowd would make up for the shortcomings I found.",

Not a beer person myself so I ordered a sangria which they were out of so had the bartender made me a mixed drink. My first mistake. It was overly sweet and had no alcohol very college style.   We ordered the Belgium fries that turned out to be soggy hand cut fries that were not twice fried. The white aioli sauce (which should be yellow since it is made with egg yolks) was just mayonnaise that had been dumped with dill and salt  - in other words, it was terrible.   We ordered the vegetable pizza which is a white pizza but no where is that mentioned the the menu. It was dry, dry as dust and flavorless. The crust was really good and would make good pretzels.  And now for the important part. My husband the beer snob was excited to try the beers! First the Coffee beer he thought was average and wouldn't drink again. The second was a Smokey Sour which was just lightly smokey and no sour. Disappointed with the brews he ordered a sample of Inside Out Stout which golden on color and was in no way a stout. Husband said all the beers were just weird and not in a good way.  He also didn't like that the beers were served with a LOT of foam/head.  We can't recommend this place, sad face. Maybe this place is fancy eats for college kids but our tastes have long matured.",

For someone who used to only drink mixed cocktails and completely write off beer, I've been on a mission to change my ways by finding good beer.  I had two beers, pious monk and their pale ale, and split an order of traditional pierogies. The 4 pierogies were served on a spread of sour cream with sauteed onions and scallions. Altogether it was only ~$10 which made my day!   Be sure to ask for Eugene/Gene, he was a character who made me really like this place and the experience. Ask for him!",

The first time you walk in, the sight is very impressive and also a bit unsettling, with big beer tanks up where the altar used to be. The food is generally quite good, with some dishes better than others. The food is on the pricier side, but is a great deal if you go for Happy Hour. Happy Hour runs until 6:30pm and offers half off appetizers. 2 appetizers are more than a meal, and so it is a great deal when you go that route. The pierogies and bruschetta are amazing. The mushroom and lentils balls are less impressive. We had a great, friendly waiter last time we were there and really enjoyed our meal.",

I will say this, it is not the Church Brew that I remember.  The beers are OK- from their usual rotation to whatever sort of seasonal they are churning out. I had the Millenium Trippel, and my girlfriend had the coconut stout. Both were reasonable.  Our appetites were slavering, having just circumnavigated the downtown looking for somewhere to park for the Jazz festival, yet leaving maligned due to the usual parking issues of downtown Pgh during an event. On the way back, we figured we had not been to Church Brew in a long time, so it would be just the ticket.   They had an insert with southern/ creoleish dishes as the specials. This really got my tastebuds raring to go, as I love spicy southern food. To start, we had the alligator peirogies, and for entrees, the Cubano, and the Pulled Pork.  The peirogies were tasty enough, but I really did not get anything related to an alligator out of that. Hide I been blind, or blindfolded, I would have assumed they were regular peirogies with a bit of chutney on top.   My girlfriends Cubano was a huge disappointment. This is the second time we have tried to get a Cuban Sammich somewhere and left thinking \"WTF\".  This sandwich is about 1) Well toasted bread 2) A good slathering of mustard 3) an evenly spread layer of crunchy pickle and 4) meat.  In that order.   My pulled pork was flavorful, but no world beater by any stretch, and was paired with rice and beans minus anything to complement them in terms of flavors. Dont get me wrong, I think those ingredients go together, but some extra spices or textures would have made the dish superb.",

We'd visit a lot more often and probably end up spending more overall if the beer prices weren't so outrageous.  And finally, the not-good:  The food.  Granted we only tried one item, but it was AWFUL.  We ordered their basket of \"homemade chips\" and they were disgusting - cold, soggy spiral-sliced potatoes that were stale (not crispy) and congealed with grease.  Inedible.   The bartender said that they \"make them fresh every day\" - ours had apparently been made in the morning and had sat around in their own cold grease all day.   We politely sent them back but the bartender didn't seem very happy about it and we spend the remainder of the visit wondering if we were going to have to argue with her about paying for them (as it turned out, we were not charged).   Final thoughts: it's a cool bar, but the novelty has worn off for us. Mediocre beer at inflated prices and terrible food.",

Someone told me that Church Brew Works is one of those places you must take out of town visitors. It took me two and a half years to see the place for myself, but I have to agree. It's beautiful with its stained glass windows and high ceilings, but it doesn't take itself too seriously.  I enjoyed the two brews we tried, the Celestial Gold and the Pious Monk. The traditional pierogies we had as an appetizer were also great. The service was friendly and prompt, and our waiter saved our party of two from making a huge mistake and ordering a pizza AND another entree. Don't do this. One pizza for two people is plenty. It could probably feed three people just fine.  Unfortunately, this place slips into 3-star territory with its pizza. We split the Southwestern, which had a chipotle-tomato sauce, corn, cheese, and red onion. Interesting flavor combo, but the pie should have been cooked longer. The center of the pie was also too thin, which meant that the tip of each slice always fell apart when I tried to pick the slice up and eat it.  I'm not a churchgoer, but I'd visit this particular house of worship again for some beer and pierogies.",

Relative to beer, Church took a major hit when its head brewery ran down the street to open his own gig (on my list of beers to try!).  Thus far, it seems like the quality of their brews hasn't been majorly affected, but CBW is one of those places that I either absolutely love or absolutely hate their beer.  A monthly rotating \"blast furnace stout\" (different flavors/methods of brewing) always presents an interesting drink, and their Cherry Quadzilla is good if you like fruity interpretations of Belgians.  Thunderhop IPA is that staple of the bunch, and a good representation of the type at that.  Relative to food, Church is generally also hit or miss here too.  Most of their food is average, however their pizza (particularly the wild boar) is extremely good (just be prepared to wait an hour plus if the oven gets backed up).  Overall, I'll give Church the nod as it truly is a unique gem to the city (one that's gotten a lot of national attention, including Brewpub of the Year), but it falls short of a five considering its roughness around the edges and a lack of consistency.",

It was delicious and I've liked Church Brew Works ever since that day.   I am not the world's biggest fan of beer. It's okay, but I've only found one type of beer that I really like (and have only found in one German restaurant in Philadelphia). I'm not going to judge the beer, though my boyfriend and beer-loving friends like the Celestial Gold most of all.   The food is good. Usually I get the pierogie saute, but when I'm feeling like eating a little healthier, I get a salad. The salad is okay, but the pierogie saute started and continues to inspire my love of pierogies. Yum. The ambiance is great. A friend of mine commented that this is the only church in which he prays - a beer hall, to the God of Beers.   I'm not giving Church Brew Works 5 stars because it's not, to me, perfect. It's good, and I've had a number of consistently good meals there, but it's got a long wait, the parking lot sucks, and the salad is good and fresh but not awe inspiring. 4 stars is solid though.",

The seats are pews, and the brewing apparatus is located where the altar used to be.  For this reason alone, it's probably the most unique place in PGH to grab a drink.  Having said that, I've generally been underwhelmed by the quality of the food here.  Although I can't recall details because it's been awhile, it just hasn't wowed me, whereas I would expect it to be gastropub-quality, given the atmosphere and the price point.  Fortunately, every time I've gone, someone else has picked up the tab.  As for the drinks, you're pretty limited if you're not a beer drinker, like me.  They do have a few wines to choose from, but again, I haven't been blown away by any of them. At a microbrewery such as this, I understand that beer is the star of the show, and I expect to be limited in my drinking options, but I would at least hope that the munchies would be good.  Given the popularity of this place with out-of-towners due to its novelty, I'm sure I'll be back at some point, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, based on my experience.",

    "text": "Quick update. To be frank, this happened a little while ago. I was just so stunned I couldn't even write it up immediately.  A manager contacted us after we posted our Yelp review and offered us a gift certificate to entice us to give them a second chance (see my previous review for the whole story of how bad the experience was). Nice move! Restaurants should take note that this is the correct practice for \"service recovery\". Unfortunately, they botched their second chance.  The manager recognized us, even though we didn't mention we were there for service recovery. He apologized about our prior bad experience and thanked us for giving them another try. We did not see him again after that.  While we were in the middle of eating our appetizers, our server brought out the entrees again, saying \"I didn't want them to get cold\"! That's the exact same thing that was the problem last time! Are you telling me that you know that we're in there explicitly to give you a second chance because of poor service on our prior visit, at your insistence, and then you go ahead and do the exact same thing that we complained about in the first place? That is the one thing they should have had figured out this time. Also, it's not like we're particularly slow eaters or anything.  They don't seem to understand: the food is going to die on the table just the same as it will die on the pass. The point of coursing a meal is so that we get the entrees at the right temperature when we're ready to eat them. If you don't want the entrees to die, don't fire them so soon. This is basic food service stuff, folks.  It's one thing to botch the coursing once. It's absolutely astonishing that they would do it again after explicitly asking us to give them a second chance for that exact problem. Wow.",

I had noticed that salads at other restaurants I had tried looked wilted and disgusting and so I had been avoiding ordering them even though I'd been dying for some veggies. So I asked the waitress about the quinoa salad at Church Brew. The waitress assured me that their salads were fresh and top quality. She seemed very offended that I would even ask about the quality of the salads.   What she brought me though was a wilted mess slathered in dressing. Some of the leaves were downright bad and had gone brown and squishy.   The quinoa was unbelievable. It tasted like old refrigerator.",

We had the beer fight with 8 beers and felt that it was actually a good price for what you got but the beer was all pretty bland and left a lot to be desired and they apparently love IPAs as the menu is laden with them. All that being said it's a cool ass place and I'm happy I went but I would not go back a second time.

    "text": "I've wanted to visit Church Brew Works ever since I first heard about it several years ago from my family. Craft brews in a unique atmosphere is right up my alley, so I was psyched when a recent trip to Pittsburgh to visit \"my people\" allowed us to visit.   The weather was perfect, so we opted to sit in the outside garden, but we retired to the inside for a final beer so that we could enjoy the gorgeous interior.   We started with the spinach and cheese dip, which was fine, and came with some unremarkable tortilla chips. My baby kale salad was pretty good (with homemade ricotta and nicely grilled chicken) and the boy's pierogi saute pretty solid with a tasty sauce that made the dish.   Church Brew Works seems like a great place in the neighborhood for friends to get together - it was even semi-busy on a Wednesday night. We definitely enjoyed our trip and got some beers to take back to Philly.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch this past weekend. This is the best church on the planet. I enjoyed the Pittsburgh-y cuisine and beverages amidst an altar of beer.   We wanted to try as many of the beers as possible, so we opted for the 8-flight beer sampler. There were a wide variety of brews in the flights. Some seemed a little off, but we generally liked most of them... I think I liked maybe 6 of the 8 samples.  Opinions on the food were mixed. The traditionally-prepared pierogies were tasty enough, but drenched in too much butter. The sweet potato fries were good, not great, and came with a spicy chipotle ketchup. My friend ordered the Cajun risotto fritters - I just had one bite, but I thought they were delicious. Others ordered pierogie pizza and didn't love it; I think they were expecting pierogies on top of the pizza, but as it turned out, the whole pizza was like a giant pierogie.   The service didn't bother me, but I think some in our party were displeased. The kitchen screwed up a few things, and the food runner was pretty unhelpful (didn't mention that plates were really hot, claimed she \"just brings out the food\" when we had an issue, etc.).  But whatever. It's a brewery in a church. Thou shall not make minor complaints.",

    "text": "Funny little place, this restaurant. I can save you most of the review about the fact it's an old church converted in to a restaurant - other reviewers have covered in depth. Novelty aside, some of the dishes are misses, but most of the items we chose were spot on.  ATMOSPHERE: (Psst... it's a church :). You'll get just what you expect for decor - an abandoned church, the altar \"desecrated\" by a massive hopper and other brewery equipment. The church aisle is largely untouched, while the sides are made into a dining area (using old pews for the booth sections. While most of the church components are largely in tact, I felt myself dissapointed that they didn't do MORE with the church theme - the organ was broken, for example, the menu's could have been like hymnals, the plates to look like offering dishes, the dishes named after hymns or had some reference to church / holy ingredients / so on. That said, you absolutely still get the picture of eating in church, to the point serious church goers might be offended (we weren't).  FOOD: There are some gems on this menu, and some unimaginative stinkers. Luckily, we listened to others and stuck to the bar menu, although many of the \"premium\" dishes looked very good walking by (very small, but still appetizing). We had:  1 - Spinach, Feta & Smoked Gouda Dip - It was \"fine\" tasting, but I expected a revelation (pun intended), and what we got was a spinach-artichoke dip in disguise that you can get at any chain restaurant anywhere. Our first impression was a dull one with this... they need to amp up the feta / gouda aspect, or do something more to make this dish stand out from others.  2 - Traditional Cheese Pizza - REALLY good... some genius brought a wood fired pizza oven into the church (come on - there's a marketing concept about flames here they missed...). The sauce was flavorful, the cheese-to-dough-to sauce ratio heavenly, and the crust was perfect thanks to the wood-firing. I dreamt about this pizza days after we left... good thing for me we live in Illinois or I'd be a heifer!  3 - Cinco Fromaggio Pizza - Good. The menu didn't say anything about sauce, so I guess I expected the traditional red. This pizza comes instead with a green basil-pesto sauce which, for us, was much too sparse and didn't have enough of a punch of flavor. This left the pizza quite dry (especially with the feta and powdered parmesan cheeses), and while we enjoyed the cheese combo, found ourselves sneaking the kid's cheese pizza instead the moment they were full. Considering the Cinco is a \"premium\" pizza, it's a shame that standard cheese kicked its butt.  4 - Church Works Brew beer flight - Must try, do not miss it (you simply cannot go to a craft brewery and NOT sample the wares... it would be a sin!). Plenty of drink, enough variety to keep you interested, and the different flavors / styles are worth it!  SERVICE: The table service was great. Our waitress was a sweetheart, and catered to our children in a way few servers do (taking their order instead of ours, talking to THEM about what they were doing in town, where THEY were from, etc.).  She made menu suggestions, brought drinks quickly, refills for kids and adults as soon as we were empty (The result was a very enjoyable evening for them - happy kids = very happy parents = great tip.  Side note - the bartender's service was less than friendly. There is a SMALL gift shop behind one corner of the bar where you can get t-shirts, 6 packs of the beer, etc.... while I appreciate the need to serve customers sitting at the bar, and there were several, I took GREAT offense to him telling me that they were more important... I believe his exact words were \"one minute --- gotta take care of the paying customers first\"... Listen bub - when someone walks up and drops more than $100 on the \"gift shop\", screw the guy on the stool and his $4 beer. (holy crap, you say? We bought a number of mini-kegger beers to serve the party of 14 at our final destination-week in VA Beach). Bottom line, our last impression was this  bartender and his poor attitude, and he should be ashamed of himself.  VALUE: All jokes aside, if you want good value you're going to have to be smart about the menu. We ordered from the bar menu only - as other reviewers warned, the dinner menu was very high pricing with very small portions. What we paid for what we got was worth it and then some... if we'd have ordered the dinner entrees, I suspect I'd feel differently.  If you are anywhere in the general vicinity of this place, stop by and check it out - you'll be happy you did.",

    "text": "Before Reading please note my review is mainly based on the service and food, as I did not try beer. I did try their wine and I was pleased with bottle pricing and taste so if you are just looking to make a pit stop for a drink consider this a 3 star review. If youa re looking to eat pass this place up. A couple of basic issues first there is little to no parking neighborhood or in the lot in the back if you are going on a weekend night so plan ahead. This is ok I can deal with it if I love the place, second I was supposed to be seated with a large group but my friend and I would have been split up due to the pew seating. This was ok it was our fault for being late. We chose to sit in the bar instead of wait for our own table. So we get in the bar and service at a table was super slow we get our wine within 10-20 minutes of sitting which is fine but I think the food took 55 minutes for two sandwiches. The food was just bleh not high on taste after that wait and the hype I have heard I was hoping for more. But it is just another chain resaurant hiding inside a church (let down). I got the philly cheesesteak sandwich my friend the crab cake because we were hoping for something quick and filling. Cheese steak was just ok bun was too big and lack of  generic cheese sauce made it dry, no sauteed onions or peppers ( again let down.) My friend had the crabcake sandwich and they had not put any sauce on it. The waitress did bring her a tiny bit of sauce as it was supposed to come with sauce. Here is the kicker the sweet potato fries we both paid  $2.00 extra on top of our 15$ sandwiches for are from Sam's club! Hahahaha I have to laugh because if you're going to serve me precooked fries which I am sure a lot of places do don't charge me extra and at least try to make sure they are wedges or something. Throw a cajun spice rub on but don't barely heat them they were super cold.... and buy them at Sam's club. If you're one of hte most hyped breweries in pgh! People notice these things lol. At least it provided me with a good laugh. So all in all 4 stars for atmosphere yea its a cool place young attractive crowd, but I am a food lover 1-2 stars for food, 3 stars for drinks. Part of town is tricky to maneuver at night. I would pass and try another brewery in town because food and beer are lovely when done properly together and maybe church brew works needs to build a better kitchen.",

I normally order the grilled turkey and watercress salad, which has the most delicious cranberry dressing -- I always want to buy a bottle of it.

I haven't found one any where else that comes close yet.  It may be the fries on top or the best ranch dressing around.  It could be the beer too!  The Pilsner is great.  Wish they had an amber but I'm not complaining.  We have also had the pizza which ask anyone...I am not a big pizza person, but it was very very good.  Brick oven pizza that is hot and delicious.  Hoping we get to sit outside this time.  Large private area with a hop garden.  Really cool place to stop and grab lunch or dinner!",

Yah, one can say it's sacriligious to drink beer in a building that was once used as a Catholic Church, but I think God has a sense of humor too! The building is beautiful, stained glass windows, and the alter used as a brewery.  The restaurant brews their own beer on site, and has many options, ones I've never tried before. I ordered a beer similiar to a budlight. The food is delicious!! We had the spinach dip and pita bread as an appetizer, and the vegetarian pizza and fish sandwhich as entrees. Both were very tasty and the portions were humungous. Definitely not somewhere to go if you are on a diet, even if you order a salad, everywhere in Pittsburgh they put french fries on their salads!! Weird. The service was great both times we went. Very helpful and informative of the city and the restaurant. I even purchased the beer glasses that said \"And on the 8th day, man created beer!\" I would defintely recommend this place if you are ever in the area, and feeling a little adventurous :-)",

    "text": "The third piece of the trilogy - read my other reviews - is this microbrewery-turned-church, the last one of my three most favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. With Catholic background and dwindling population and culture, Pittsburgh has lots of old church buildings that are converted into a completely new venue. One of the other places is called Sanctuary, which is a three-story club now, and it's quite awesome inside. This place, when you walk in, imposes the brew house that's sitting where the altar used to be. Above the setup it has a Latin phrase that went something like \"our god, eternal light...\", and the angels flying around in the stained glasses are smiling down on you with bottles in their hands. I don't know what will happen to the religious state of mind if a devout Christian walks in here. Maybe it will explode. But I think it's awesome that instead of tearing this structure down they decided to add a spin to the place and make a great use out of it. It's part of the memory of the community - not that I was part of the specific neighborhood, but still - and you should be able to live with the changing times and at least be thankful that most part of what the church used to be is still providing people shelter and utility.  Anyways, back to more important matters. The setup makes you feel you're at an indoor beer garden. The echoing of chitter-chatters are somewhat unique because there's no church music or bar music playing in the background. So imagine you're a monk and you step into the dining area of your monastry, except you're in the 21st century. Food: excellent, the large pizzas are quite massive and massively tasty so be prepared to share it with at least one other people (two guys should share one, or three girls, or four kids... you get the idea). I think the pizza guy Their other food was also great. Beer: fantastic. The most memorable one was their dark ale, which they roast the malt enough so that the color is darker and the flavor is, duh, roasty, and grainy. I wonder if they sell their bottled beers in other states too. Again, I miss you too. I'll be back someday.",

It's nothing overwhelming that made me have to leave though. To be honest I don't care for their beer too much, it's more of the idea of this place that I love.

The brews were quite good -- I had the ThunderHop IPA and Pipe Organ Pale, and both fit nicely into the American tradition, with the Pipe Organ being slightly hoppier than expected, with a nice body and rounded flavor, and the ThunderHop approaching super-hop tendencies but not going over the top.    The space is great for visiting with friends and family, as long as nobody will be offended by brewery equipment holding the place of honor on the altar.  The food was solid but not a revelation, but it does just what it needs to, to not get in the way of the fun you're having enjoying beers in an old church.  I had a buffalo burger that was well-cooked without drying out at all, and the housemade chips were a great touch.  Our server was very friendly and helpful in navigating the menu and the takeout options (mmm, growlers). I don't know about the pricing, because my in-laws picked up the tab, which I'm sure also added to my enjoyment.    If you like beer, or dining for the experience, this is definitely worth a visit while in the 'burgh.",

Friends had pizzas but they're nothing pretty to look at and I didn't try them. I had the filet mignon because I was feeling extravagant, and for under $30 it might have been a steal. But the medium-rare I ordered was grey throughout (not that I was surprised, Pittsburgh consistently does not know how to make beer to order). Our waiter had absolutely no time for us, or I probably would have asked him to take it back or off the bill.

Unfortunately you can see the poor pizza boy slaving away in the corner to the right of the brass tanks, stuffing dough into the wood-fired oven, trapped in a metal cubicle of cheese and toppings.

They started it off with an off-menu pumpkin stout. You could drink it all night it was so good. But, it was just the start. There was definitely a lot of beer to be drunk, pun intended. They also included some of their souvenir glasses at the end.  Sitting down with us was one of the brewers, Justin Viale. Justin was a lot of fun to be with and his sharing of his brewing knowledge and CBW experience added to the evening. The chef, Joe Kiefer, came out with each course to explain it. Great job, Joe.  Finally, we learned these special dinners are put on every other month. We thought this was an Oktobefest only event. We'll be going back for more!",

The restaurant is indeed housed in a former catholic church and for that gets 2 stars. Seating options were outdoors or indoors; bar or restaurant. We selected the restaurant which we later learned has a separate menu from the bar seating. This is important, since the restaurant menu doesn't offer the pizzas which were pretty much the best thing there. I mean that in a good way, the pizzas are similar to the kind you might find in northern Italy, in fact it might have been the best pizza I've had outside of Italy. Also recommended: the spinach, feta and gouda dip. The menu was interesting and we enjoyed the bison and mushroom meatloaf, wings  and several types of perogies, but the dip and pizzas were the high points for us.  The beer was excellent. We ordered a sampler and then each had a pint of our favorite. The Dunkel was a winner as was the seasonal hopless Ambrosia. Really fine beers for all palates. While not cheap, the prices were reasonable for the quality of food and ambiance. Service was excellent, and in later conversation we tabbed our waiter Shawn, \"Porter Laureate\", for his artfully accurate descriptions of the various beers.  I would return here if the opportunity should ever arise.",

    "text": "I love Church Brew Works and come here often. They have some great brews and some not so great brews, but they have something for everyone. Their best brews (in my opinion) are the Belgian Tripel, the Mole Stout, the Coconut Stout, and the Dunkel.   I've only eaten off of the bar menu, but I find the food to be consistently good. The pizzas are especially excellent.   The service is sometimes spotty, but the servers are doing the best they can and are good about communicating about delays. There is one bartender who is kind of a jerk.  The ambiance is great. It's a stunning location that was the neighborhood's Catholic church for years. The stained glass windows are especially great. For those of you complaining about the smell - it's a brewery! That's what it smells like when they are brewing.   My only complaint is that they sometimes close early at night depending on the crowd.  The takeaway growlers are a great value.",

I wasn't sure what to expect but as soon as I walked in my breath was taken away. Growing up Catholic I have been in several churches but not one this old and with an operating brewery inside. It was very impressive! Unfortunately we had already eaten so we just had some beer and took lots of pictures. The staff was very nice and the beer was good too! I would have loved to take a tour to see what they were using the surrounding buildings for. good for you that you saved this old church from demolition and turned it into a fun place without losing the old time feel!!",

The waitress had to be asked multiple times to bring napkins, etc.. and didn't really check in. Even getting the check and getting out was slow.  The food took a long time to come out. I had the pulled pork tacos and was very disappointed. They were SO greasy and didn't have a ton of flavor. I got the \"bottom of the barrel\" fries, which did not impress either.  I wanted to like this place, but would not recommend it based on my experience.",

Our table even joked they had EXACT same color, size & appearance of Campbell's!! Just add liquid smoke flavor, dump into serving dish & charge$$$$. Gross. Cocktails & beers were very good. Service fair. But AVOID food, too pricey & not tasty. Lots of better options in the city.",

I love that they have a pierogie of the day, although I confess I've never tried those. They have a varied menu that's executed surprisingly well for a place with so much potential gimmick. The one bummer is the long wait on Friday and Saturday nights. If you show up without a reservation, don't be surprised if you have to wait 30 minutes or more to be seated, despite how cavernous this place looks.  The food is a bit expensive by Pittsburgh standards, I guess. Thankfully I'm now immune to that, as I earn my salary outside of western Pennsylvania... so I look forward to coming back and indulging at Church Brew Works =P",

    "text": "For my money, this is the best place to have a beer in Pittsburgh.*  It's a desacramentalized** Catholic church that was shut down during a reorganization period in Pittsburgh's religious history, due to the overall shrinking of the population.  Beer has replaced the sacramental wine and the crucified savior has been replaced with a beer vessel for an altar, but the spiritual feeling remains and the irony of the term vessel is imbued...or I could just be getting a buzz.  Either way, this is an awesome atmosphere to have a drink with a bunch of friends.  And the beer...some is better than others. One of the IPAs was way too grassy-tasting, but I thought the Thunderhead was just about right.  The Belgian Trippel was refreshing, but it didn't have enough bite for me.  I had a sip of every beer they offered, and while none were bad at all, I wasn't blown away.  At the same time, the prices aren't bad, especially for a pint.  If the beer was better, this place would be five stars.    * I didn't eat the food, so I'm totally unqualified to rate it ** I just wanted to use that word in a sentence",

    "text": "This unique venue is situated in a repurposed church turned brewery/restaurant. They feature all their own beer with a diverse selection of beer styles. Utilizing the open floor plan of the church, its almost a communal feel to the dining experience.  A brick oven sits atop of the altar on the right, while there is seating for about 20 on the center \"altar\".   As far as their beer is concerned\"You're Killin Me S'mores\" is excellent and their double IPA is smooth and refreshing. In True brewery style they offer flights so you can sample a variety of their brews.  The brick oven pizzas seem to be their specialty.  However we opted for some of the more upscale entrees. My wife had the Wagu beef with was very tender and flavorful for around $34. I chose the T-bone with sweet mashed potatoes.  I was not as impressed with this cut of meat as it was a thin slice steak and seemed to have been frozen. Bummer, but the sweet mashed were phenomenal.    It seemed as though most dinner parties were ordering the pizza and had i know about the T-bone I would have opted for a different selection.   Overall this unique brewery and restaurant was good and they participate in NoWait which is great as we had a 45-50 min wait.",

    "text": "Instead of being bored in church, I ate boar in Church Brew Works.  This was seriously one of the most unique places I've ever dined and imbibed. The church was gorgeous yet functional as a business. It was the perfect hybrid of a brewery, restaurant and church. The stained glass windows glistened in the sunlight and building dripped with nostalgia and history.   The food also falls into the category of the more unique things I've ever consumed. My husband and I split the Bison Corn Dogs and the Chicken and Boar Chorizo Jambalaya. The corn dogs were like carnival corn dogs on steroids. After having bison, I'm not sure if I can ever go back to the mystery meat of a regular corn dog. They were perfectly fried on the outside and the chipotle ketchup added a nice spicy dip. I don't normally eat ketchup but found it to be absolutely enjoyable. The jambalaya consisted of braised chicken and house made boar chorizo sausage simmered with tomatoes, peppers and onions in creole spices.  It was served over rice. It was flavored really well and I enjoyed it a bit too quickly.   What blew my mind was the Wild Boar BBQ Pizza. I sampled two slices from my friend and wish I ordered a whole pie for myself. Per the description it consisted of slow roasted pulled wild boar, Pious Monk Dunkel BBQ sauce, red onion, corn, mozzarella and provolone cheese. The BBQ sauce was tangy and the boar had a slight crisp to it.  All the ingredients blended perfectly together.   Having just watched a Travel Channel special that featured Church Brew Works, I was psyched to try the rattlesnake pierogie. To my disappointment, rattlesnake is a seasonal feature.  Apparently everyone asks about it.   Unfortunately, I wasn't overly impressed by the beer. My husband and I split the sampler and I found most of the brews to fall a little flat. I typically love IPAs but this one just wasn't doing it for me. Since we didn't love any of the eight beers we sampled, we decided to try the Cherry Quadzilla. That evening it was only sold in a bottle so we ponied up the $16 and went for the full bottle. That was pretty decent. It was about 10% ABV but didn't taste that strong. The cherry flavor wasn't overly fruity but had a very strong presence in each sip.   Like most people I encountered on my Pittsburgh trip, our server was friendly and knowledgeable. My friend has a sweet tooth ordered two desserts for dinner. One of his desserts consisted of blueberry ice cream and a cookie and was new to the menu. She was very interested in his opinion about the new dessert and they had a great dialogue on it.   With all that being said, I would definitely recommend Church Brew Works to anyone visiting or living in Pittsburgh.  My rating is based on a 5 for atmosphere, 4.5 for food and 3.5 for beverage.",

I can't remember the name of my drink, but it was something like coffee liquor with cinnamon. Came with whipped cream on top and decorated with an actual cinnamon stick. I'm a sucker for cute drinks, and for coffee, so this was awesome. I'm not a big beer drinker, but I liked the IPA that others at my table got.  The pizza was also delicious. One was chicken and pineapple - pretty good. The other was artichoke, spinach, and feta. LOVED that one!  I recommend giving this place a try if you're in the area, just for the experience!",

Bass and accordion players played and sang \"Happy Birthday\" to several patrons, while toasting their beers, as well.

Walking in felt really weird due to being a church but once I got inside it was awesome, so unique! I decided to sit at the bar because I was there by myself and the place is huge and probably one of the craziest places I have been before. i started with their crab dip, not my favorite but it was still pretty good then I enjoyed two of their beers, an IPA and a Pale ale both tasted great. The bartender was very friendly and provided good feed back on places around the area and the beer they had. I really wanted to try their buffalo perogies but was so full from the beer that I took them to go, I am SO glad I did that! Just finished eating them and they were everything I hoped they would be! If I were in town longer I would definitely come back here to try different food and beers!   * a little on the pricey side BUT at least the food, beer, service, and experience made up for that so if you dont mind spending a little its worth it :)",

They actually left the stain glass, bench seating at entry way, and the alter in the front which displays their equipment for brewing their beers. I want to start off mentioning the service here which is impeccable. They are very attentive, good sense of humors, and the manager came over to our table and asked how every thing was going. Now the food is really good, but I didn't care for the beers so much. I like wheat and fruity beer so I just don't think this was the right brewery for me. We ordered the buffalo pierogies to share and they were probably the best pierogies I ever had! Also, since it was my birthday, they gave us a big piece of chocolate mousse cake with peanut brittle for free! Even if you aren't hungry or thirsty, this place is worth a visit for the ambience alone!",

The sour beer was flavorless but the barrel aged was decent. We go some great pictures and souvenirs and I took an order of the bread pudding to go.

To see the Latin verses on the walls and the spiraling vestibules and a beer brewing tank where the altar is. Something about a bar where the confessionals used to be all seems wildly sacrilegious - THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!  Seriously a legit converted church down to the dungeon type bathrooms. Great atmosphere and a TON of seating - well, because church!!  Food, not bad- had a salad. Not mind blowing, but good. Prices reasonable. Specialty beers avail, but I'm a wine guy so didn't try but heard from colleagues that the home brew was great.   Will def be coming back.",

The church is huge and has been split into two sides, the dining side and the bar side, separated by the long isle that leads straight to the alter where all the beer brewing stills are located. A glorious sight!  Usually, this place is great for their brick oven pizza, but they do not have it currently due to some issues with their oven. If they get it back, I highly recommend the Pierogi Pizza!!!!  Our latest venture there after not going for about 2 years, I had the chicken and sausage jambalaya. Good and extremely Spicy! Their home brewed beers did the trick to extinguish the flames though.  This place has always been popular, so even though it is huge, it can get extremely crowded and you might have to wait for a table if you plan on dining in the dining side. I believe you can seat yourself on the bar side but finding a table can be tricky, especially on the weekend.  Here's to Church Brew Works bringing back the pizza oven and never changing! Cheers!",

I could see how this could be offensive to very strong Catholics but I really enjoyed it. I've never been anywhere else like it. They also have a lot of mix drink/liquor options.   The food was also wonderful! I had these arancini balls with a cooling mint yogurt drizzle over the top and it was so good and different. I also had their Seven Onion soup which was basically just French onion soup but it was delicious! I got their house Manhattan to drink, as well as a strawberry mojito. The mojito was very sugary and not much alcohol flavor but the Manhattan was DEEEElish.   I would highly recommend this place to out of town visitors or even people who live there. There's really nowhere else like it to even compare it to. The servers were super friendly, attentive but not overly attentive. They host parties here as well I believe. It was really cool to sit in a pew and eat food.   Definitely would return!",

When my companion said she couldn't find it on the menu the first thing I did was look for the pizza oven. Argh! It's gone! Well dang what now, need time to think.  I mean you can't be set on pizza and just switch to chicken without some preparation and reflection. So we ordered beer and the pepperoni roll appetizer.  We both enjoyed the pepperoni roll, and should have stopped there since the itch was scratched so to speak.  But we came for a meal and after studying the menu we settled on the Shinkasa cheesesteak. I say settled because it was very bland and the roll tasted like nothing and had no texture.    Service and ambiance were great nevertheless but next time we'll stick to the appetizer options.",

However, they do have a large menus with wide variety of dishes.   Like most Brewery, their beer are mostly IPA. Their pepper beer and coffee stout are rather quite delicious with spot-on flavors.

Savory delights like pierogies, wasabi-tossed brusselsprouts, and steak served from local sources are a bit pricey because of the small business margins but rewarding to the community. They're tasty but not knock-outs and the steak was par.   A pub on the bride's side of the chapel and a sit-down on the groom's. The decor and bones of the building turn your head. The chatter and constant flow of patrons are an intoxicating buzz.",

    "text": "What a huge disappointment.   The three of us (me, wife and son) arrived and were seated immediately. This was, by far, the best customer service of the night.   It took a few minutes for our waitress to arrive. \"No big deal.\" I think. The restaurant is busy (but nowhere near full) and its early - we have time.   We decide to put our son's order in immediately. He takes longer to eat and usually requires some coaxing, so I am fine if his meal arrives 10 minutes earlier than mine - it creates a nice buffer for everyone.   A few minutes later my wife and I place our order - soup and pirogies for her, meatloaf for me.  Our beers arrive. Our sons meal arrives. Everything is going smoothly. And then nothing happens. We wait. And wait. And wait. No updates from the server. No checking in. Nothing.   We are pretty patient people. We understand things can get backed up. We try to enjoy our drinks while our son reads his Highlights magazine and chomps on fries (he thought the Mac and Cheese tasted funny - and I agreed). After nearly half an hour my patience is at an end. My child is done eating and starting to get restless and we don't even have soup, let alone entrees. I flag down our waitress and ask if my wife's soup is at least coming soon. She pulls out her notepad and stares at it with wide eyes and rushes off.   By this point the tables around us, who are larger parties and arrived after us, are getting their food. Many of these other tables having ordered the same items we had ordered.   The soup arrives and our waitress tries to leave without a word. When I ask if our food is coming soon she informs me she will find out. \"The kitchen is backed up.\" we are told. (Not too backed up for other people who ordered the exact same things after us?)  Finally our entrees arrive - nearly 45 minutes after our sons. No apologies. No explanation.   At this point I flag down a manager. I don't like talking to managers. I am not a complainer. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but at this point I was extremely frustrated.   But here is where things get truly bizarre. As my wife and I calmly explain our frustration, it becomes clear that the manager is more annoyed with us than anything.  We ask for boxes. We get our check. No words. No acknowledgement.  And because one more dumb thing needs to happen, we find that there is no pen to sign the check - just an eyeliner pen. What is happening!?!?  The manager comped our entrees, which seemed appropriate, but that wasn't the goal. We wanted an apology. We wanted an explanation. If you read any of my reviews, I am generally pretty positive and forgiving - but this was just too much.   Here's the thing: I normally LOVE Church Brew Works. The beer selection is great and the food is really solid.   Tonight's meal was a disaster. The food was good, the service was poor. It makes me sad to say that we won't be returning any time soon.",

One thing that sets this place apart from most other beer-centric places I've gone is that there is a full bar, which is also nice is you have a large group and/or visitors that dont get into the whole beer thing.",

Not saying they're bad but just nothing remarkable. Also, the service was fine but perhaps overly so. Our waitress just couldn't stop visiting us every five minutes or so to see if we needed anything, decided on entrees, decided on desserts, again and again! Seemed like she was either pushing us to stay and order more or leave. We weren't not lingering and the restaurant was not busy so it couldn't have been that they needed the table.",

It is a brewery inside a large old church so it is beautiful. It is worth going just to be able to sit inside.   Beer/Food : we only had two appetizers so we don't have much base this after. We got the bbq pulled pork nachos and we didn't love it. The meat was really tender but we didn't love the taste of the bbq and we especially didn't like the Lima crema. It was way too strong. We also got the pepperoni roll and it was good. There was a really big beer selection. The flight comes with 8 beers of good sizes so we shared it with the table. I was a little upset because usually while my friends are having the beers I try a cider but none was offered here-- a little upsetting.   Service: we didn't find service to be outstanding.. very average.",

I also tried some sweet potato fries that were tasty, and my friend said his mussels were good.  We made the mistake of sitting outside on the deck.  Would not recommend.  There were flies everywhere and it was incredibly frustrating.  I had to step inside to pay the check because I couldn't take it anymore.

We were kind of apprehensive based on some of the reviews on yelp but since this was the only brewery open on Sunday we figured how bad could it actually be.   To our great surprise it was amazing.    The service was top notch The food was great and very original The beer was well balanced and while they had some simple flag ships they also had some amazing experimental brews. The space....Whats there to say about a church being turned into a brewery other than AWESOME!  If you are ever in the area make it a point to stop in and check this brewery out. They have been around for 17 years so they are not just jumping on the craft beer crazy but have put years of work into perfecting their brand and beer.",

And not only was my brew delicious it was priced right, my 2 fantastic pints were between $2.50 and $4.50 and both on point.   So as far as grub... It was way overpriced. We had Pierogies, which from my understanding are unique to the Burgh, they were delicious for four $3.25 for potato and cheese and $7.00 for Sausage and sauerkraut which was amazing. I had the Jambalaya which was pretty good, but not $18.00 good. So while the food and drink was good the price needs help, at least on the food.   Beautiful Church by they way I hope you heathens enjoy drinking your wicked brew in it as much as I did.",

The stained glass is beautiful and they even have a few of the confessional rooms used as storage behind the bar! Definitely worth stopping in for a drink, but there are much better places to get food.  We had the cheesy spinach dip as an appetizer and that was pretty good, although a small serving. I was very excited for the brisket...which turned out to be under-cooked and very rubbery. I didn't even eat half of it. I was able to sample some platters that others with me ordered. I was impressed with the Buffalo Meatloaf. The Pierogie entree was very good but was almost $20!   The best part of our dinner was our server, Ally. She was pleasant, energetic and patient with our indecisive party of 8. She was very knowledgeable about the different types of beers and made great suggestions for our table.  As far as the beer goes, Thunderhop and Unholy Matrimony are pretty good...Not sure if they have a happy hour, but if they do, that would be a great time to sample their beers, take in the sights and then head somewhere else for dinner.",

Two years later I made the visit, on my first night of what will be at least four years in Pittsburgh.  So how did my first visit go?  Food (5.0/10) = Before I moved here, I did some research on foods unique to Pittsburgh.  One of the items that kept popping up were the pierogis.  As such, I was excited to order pierogis as my first dish in this city.  So what exactly did I get.  Hmmm.  I saw four pillow-like objects that looked like Chinese dumplings, but a little larger.  They sat in a pool of butter, and topped with a big ass dollop of sour cream.  Hmm, ok....so now to find out what juiciness awaits on the inside.  Mashed potatos?  Wait a second...what the hell is this? A blob of fat laying on top of carbs stuffed with more carbs, all swimming in a pool of fat?  My attention was then redirected to my friend who had just ordered the pierogi pizza.  Using my imagination, I visualized a thick crust pie with chunks of dough and mashed potatoes as toppings.  I was almost correct.  It was essentially a mashed potato pizza.  Now this concept is great if executed properly.  In fact, a pizza joint in New Haven, CT called Bar pretty much perfected this (Bacon, mashed potato thin crust pizza).  However, the pierogi pizza fell flat.  Just carbs on more carbs.    I also ordered what I thought would be a turkey breast sandwich.  I received grocery store deli turkey meat (the slimy processed kind that swims in sodium nitrite preservative inside a plastic container) in between two dry pieces of bread.  And this sandwich costs $9-10?  Where's the actual real turkey breast I thought I paid for?  Needless to say, the food was a big disappointment.    The only thing that I can say positive things about is the beer.  Great beer selection.  Hell, it's a \"brewery,\" so better get the beer right, right?  Ambiance (8.0/10) = Certainly a unique set up.  Beer everywhere. Stained glass.  You can pray to the beer gods here.  Service (8.0/10) = Our waitress was great.  Allowed me to sample several of their beers before selecting one.   Was attentive.  Overall Opinion = A cool place to check out at least once.  Beer is good.  Food is meh.  $9-10 for a crappy sandwich worth about $1,...hell no.  No amen to that abomination.",

Decent food and decent draft beer, but they were our of (real) IPA both times we visited.  They peddled something they called \"Belgian IPA,\" but it didn't have enough hops to taste.  They were out of their real IPA both on tap and in bottles both times we visited, about a week apart.    The atmosphere, food, and beer are all better than average, and that's a strong triad.  They also have sweet potato fries.  Despite the deceptive (deficit) IPA availability, we still ended up going twice during a 2 week visit to the \"burgh.  MEL",

I don't know of what - but every time I come here, it smells gross. Like an old wash rag or something. Just unclean. The food is nothing special. It's typical middle-of-the-road bar food, if that. Beer selection is fine. I like beer, but I also enjoy a good atmosphere, and Church doesn't give that to me.   Aside from the cool views inside, this place is nothing stellar.

    "text": "As an out-of-towner the Brew Works had been recommended by several others as a place to check out while in Pittsburgh. I really like visiting breweries, and I love food and old buildings, so what's not to like? We stopped in just for a beer, as we had eaten earlier and didn't have a lot of time. The venue is breathtaking; it's worth it to come here just to enjoy the space and the stain glass windows. Definite plus that this old church was saved from demolition. I didn't order any food, but based on those around me it appeared that the prices might be a little high for what they offered. I had a stout, which was pretty good, and my partner had the doppelbock, which we agreed was just okay. There were no prices for the drinks on the menu (which drives me crazy) and the chalkboard menus behind the bar were too high to fully read. I think if we could have seen the IBUs on the menu for the doppelbock then it wouldn't have been our first choice, since we are not hopheads. They don't have many of their beers available in bottles or cans, so we settled on their Celestial Gold as a gift/souvenier for my parents.   I'm definitely glad that I visited this place, and I think that it's worth the time if you're in the area. Now that I've seen it though, I don't have a huge desire to return. I think it would be neat if they played up the church atmosphere- some old choral music playing over the speakers instead of classic rock, but maybe that's just me. I will say this; it's great to see those brewing tanks up on the alter where they belong!",

We were seated in a section where I'm sure pews used to be, and had lovely views of the original stained-glass windows and open cathedral architecture.

The architecture of the place is the main draw here - it's a restaurant/brewery built in an old church and that's really the most fun part.  Once you're over that, it's a microbrewery & restaurant plain and simple.  The food was good - I ordered the pierogies because 'when in Pittsburgh...'; those were fine, but... I was focusing on my delicious Celestial Gold beer.  My wife had a pork-chop encrusted in chorizo which could've been interesting but was rather boring.  The entrees seemed expensive to me.  Maybe not though... maybe that's Pittsburgh prices or something.  The beers were pretty good - Knowing what I know, I would probably just skip the dinner next time and just come here for drinks and the pub-grub.  Did I mention the beer was really good?  It was really good.  One minor annoyance was the extremely long wait for the check - there was probably something wrong with the register because even the waitress mentioned she was sorry for the long delay.",

Three things I am \"In to\"-- Ben Franklin, beer, and churches.  I loved the atmosphere here, and would take the time soak it all in again if I had the chance. The whole theme really had me at hello. I've seen the whole revival of an old church space into something of a place of drunken debauchery done before, it's pretty popular in trendy European neighborhoods, but the Church Brew Works has toned it down a notch to make it accessible and enjoyable without being cheesy. I think Ben Franklin would have approved.  The brew selections were nice, and along with what I sampled, I thought I got a fair deal for what I paid.   The thing that made this a three star was (and I hate to say it) was the service. Our bartender had an easy job. We were two thirsty people on a Thursday late afternoon, but still, she seemed unenthused at helping us quench our thirst. We made it work, but without even cracking so much as a smile, or offering any suggestions or sharing any history of the place, she slid our drinks across the counter only after we flagged her down. I am hoping that she's had better days before and since.  My conclusion is, I'll be back. Next time for food, and anticipating some better service.",

One of the Belgian Style Ales (I forget the name) was absolutely delicious.  Along the same lines as many other reviews the service left a bit to be desired. Oh Church Brew Works I wanted to give you 4 stars but servers that get salty because we aren't ordering food? Minus 1 star. I mean c'mon the name of the place has Brew in the name. Maybe we should've stayed sitting at the bar...  Regardless, an awesome place to check out simply for drinking beer in what used to be a church!",

Highlights were the winter Saison (which was not very saison-like- more of a vanilla winter ale) and stout which had a nice smoky flavor. Food was above par for a brewery with good local flavor. I tried the perogies which were great as well as a fairly basic but good turkey, Brie, and cranberry sandwich. Staff was very friendly.The highlight (apart from the beer) was the amazing setting- an old Roman Catholic Church. I am not much for church tourism (as a Jewish girl) but this one is well worth a visit. Formal confessionals now sell merchandise. This place is a must on your visit to Pittsburgh breweries.",

Even with the call, I was still confused.  So I went to the building that looked like a church, and went inside.  Then boom, beer flowing the rooftops...ok that's an imagination that I have.  We went down the middle aisle and seated half day the church.  There was beer filters, bars, tables, and tvs.  I wasn't sure if it was blasphemous or simply a restaurant that was renovated in a church.  That's exactly how it is.  Interesting and eerie with a twist of humor.    I ordered the Cod Fish Sandwich which I imagined to be small for only $10.00.  The fish was a bit dry, mainly because I didn't  put any type of dressing on it, so that's my fault.  I don't drink beer...or try not to, so I can't really tell you about the beer.  My coworker liked it.  He had like 10 glasses.  Alki!  service is ok.",

    "text": "My favorite restaurant in the Burgh, this place has yet to let me down.  I love that they have a specials page in the menu, so I make it a point to order something from it every time I visit. From chanterelle soup (with a nice story about the owner picking the mushrooms himself), to the Octoberfest pizza, to the bolognese lasagna, to the special pierogis - nothing on this menu has disappointed me in the least. I like that this part of the menu goes along with the seasons as well, it keeps the food fresh and keeps me on my toes when searching for dinner.  On a special note, the pizza here is definitely underrated. The crust is fantastic and you can actually see the pizza station tucked away in a corner of the church, so you know exactly what work goes into making such a delectable dough delight.  Along with the food, the beer is good as well. One of my pet peeves is a brewery that makes a watery stout (see: rock bottom), and thankfully the beer at the Church meets my expectations. Their seasonal/rotating beers are a great way to switch things up as well, and I have found myself contemplating the finer points in life while enjoying many of their brews.  If you hate good food and good beer, the setting itself is worth a visit. On my first visit, I couldn't believe that this place is actually just a church that was renovated to a brewpub. Stained glass windows - check, pipe organ - check, pews for seating - check. This place has it all.  So go for the food, beer, and atmosphere, get one of the specials and a new beer, and leave happy.",

After I double checked that it was more than 16% which would still fall into an acceptable range, I asked if there's anything particular wrong about it. The waiter replied that he would asked if the service is okay if any customer is giving less than 20%. I really did not know there's an expectation of at least 20% here. I was paying tips in this city 15%-20% for more than two years.This was the first time someone made me feel so bad about it.",

BJ reported his brew to be okay.  He had the Pittsburgh Pierogie Pizza with potato puree, sauteed onions, garlic and cheddar cheese.  He never leaves scraps, but did on this occasion.  So, I'm sure that's not saying a lot for the pizza.  I sampled it, it was tastey, but also very dry.  I opted for the Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich.  The pork was pretty much tasteless, and I failed to taste any BBQ sauce.  Also, the ciabatta bread was pretty tough.  My sweet potatoes fries were good and they should be since there was a $2 upcharge for the little suckers.    Maybe we ordered the wrongs things.  Or maybe dinner is bettter.

I don't actually drink, but I do know that this place has a good variety of beers, particularly microbrews that are either created on site or bought from an external source. I think the atmosphere of the restaurant is great for kicking back with a good group of friends over a beverage and maybe getting a bit of pretzel or salad, but that's as far as it goes for me, kids.  As a pizza fanatic, this place did not even blip on my radar of what I would call real pizza. Their pie has all of the markings of any overwrought craft in that the end result is not a celebration of the magical composition of perfect components in harmony. Instead, flavors are contorted, ingredients masked, and mediocrity served. Having grown up in a family that (in addition to pizza) also makes pierogis from scratch, I found their version very fair to midland--just passing. The problem I guess for me is that a regular potato pierogi should not give one heartburn, which I took as a sign of too much grease used in the cooking.   Although the restaurant does provide a nice atmosphere to gather a group, I must add that the last time I met some friends there it smelled keenly of petting zoo. We figured that it must have been one of the grain ingredients for the beer, but it was STRONG. Try at your own risk. :)",

    "text": "Pros:  1. The brewery is located in a gorgeous church. I mean, it is really really pretty. The novelty of eating & drinking in a church is pretty great.   2. The brews served up are so delicious they could make a monk cry. If you love a good local brewery with a consistently good reputation, church brew works is a shining star. Fortunately, the brews are bottled & you can buy them around town in cases & six packs. I have drank multiple sampler cases of all their various ales, ipas, ambers and stouts, and loved every single one of them - that's saying a lot. I can be particularly hateful about subpar beer.   Cons;  1. The wait staff appears to be trained in assholism, to a degree that I have often been discouraged from going here. Too many times I have left swearing never to return for the abuse & neglect. Once I sprained my ankle here on some slippery stairs. Instead of offering me an apology and a bag of ice, as a decent person might, or offering a number of their lawyer in the event of a personal injury liability claim, the waiter was a complete dick & tried to up-sell me on an expensive bourbon shot, \"for the pain.\"   2. Some of the food is mediocre, but none of it is a good value. I am a person who loves garlic, but you have to wonder why you can't taste any other flavors in so many of their dishes. The food is overpriced without a quality to back the price tag. They have a tempting \"pierogie of the day\" dish -- don't fall for it, it is disgusting 99% of the time. If you have to eat here, try one of the pizzas. Vegetarians have limited choices here. Vegans will starve.   3. Church Brew Works brings in people who would otherwise never venture to Lawrenceville, and gives them a totally mistaken impression of the neighborhood. This is not a place where you befriend folks at the next table. The majority of people here are not like you. And you should be happy you are not like them.   Despite all this, it is a really really pretty church! Good place to impress parents & in-laws from out of town. Office ladies who live in the suburbs will eat this up. Your wait staff is likely to deserve less than a 10% tip, but if you are like me, you will be guilted into leaving at least 15% because the universal good tip karma requires that you pay it forward.",

The beer here isn't bad but you have to suffer through the insufferable waitstaff to drink it. Head to Penn Brewery for a good Pittsburgh brewery.

We finally had a night to go out and do something so I thought it would be nice to go eat somewhere different.   The beer here was very nice. I ordered the Celestial Gold. I'm not a huge fan of dark beer so I thought this would be a great option and i really enjoyed it! Bobby ordered the Polaris Patersbier which is explained in their menu blonde belgian beer with minty/hop aromas and a herbal/pine finish with a little bitterness.. woah that explained it perfectly. How do they do that? I stuck with the same beer and next he tried Pious Monk Dunkel . It wasn't his favorite so he ended with the patersbier :) i noticed a few people ordering the beer sampler (as well as pictures of it on yelp) I did not see this advertised in the menu and totally forgot about it. Maybe next time :( (Where was this located in their beer menu?!)  For appetizer, we ordered the traditional perogies. The onions were perfect! I could have had them as a side dish.   For dinner, I ordered the southwest chicken wrap and upgraded to sweet potato fries.  To be honest, the fries were not hot at all which was a real bummer because i LOVE sweet potato fries. Everywhere i've went, the restaurant served the fries with a honey cinnamon dip. CBW served with a chipotle ketchup. Dont get me wrong, it was a nice twist on ketchup, but it did not go with sweet potato fries at all. Seriously. Who thought sweet potato fries and spicy ketchup went together?   Bobby ordered the shrimp & grits.... DELICIOUS. I was skeptic because It seems like a light brunch affair, not dinner but it was very filling and was made perfectly.   For dessert, we ordered the frozen peanut butter mouse cake. It was okay.. nothing too special.  I found service to be average. The GM was walking around so happy and peppy asking tables about their meal. Also, when walking to the restroom all of the other servers seemed happy and great with their tables. Our server Ashley put no enthusiasm into the night and kind of seemed annoyed when we asked about the different beers. Also, our dirty appetizer plate sat on our table the entire meal even though i put it right on the end and Ashley stopped at our table a few times. It was a little awkward especially because i used to serve and a big tip is to clear the table when you see dirty plates. Whatever..   Service, my crappy sweet potato fries & the mediocre dessert are stopping me from the 4 star review.  We enjoyed the beer though and atmosphere.  im sure we will be back soon.",

It's set up with a bar and high top tables on the left and dinner tables on the right. There's also outdoor seating. They have parking in the back but it gets filled quickly.  They have about 8-10 beers on draft. My favorite is the celestial ale. It's light and crisp, and great for people that don't really like beer. They do flights as well but every time I go they are missing a few.   Food is just ok. Nothing extraordinary. They do make homemade chips, when fried right they're delicious, but sometimes they are stale.",

We got there and the place is just enormous. The tanks are set up at the altar and are the first thing you see. We were seated in just a few minutes and everyone found something on the menu that they liked.  I had the Chapple sandwich (chicken apple bacon sandwich) and my wife had the pulled pork sandwich. The Chapple was tangy and delicious. The perfect taste for a sandwich of that makeup. I upgraded the fries to sweet potato, and was a little disappointed with them though. They were seasoned a bit heavily with just salt and pepper. (lighter seasoning and cinnamon is never a bad choice for sweet potatoes)  The beers were excellent. They were out of the Pipe Organ IPA, but we represented most of what they had on draft and everyone liked what they got -- Thunderhop IPA, Dunkel, and Cool Guy IPA.  On a final note, we were a little dissatisfied with the time it took to flag down our server after we had finished to pay for our meal. Other than that we were very pleased with the service. I'd go back.",

    "text": "I really usually like the Church Brew Works but last night, maybe a fluke, was just not up to snuff. I had fun because of the people that I was with but the food and service was just lacking.....  We had a group of 5 people that wanted to go out to dinner and hang out on a Saturday night. Fran, one of the friends, called the restaurant and asked if they took reservations. The lady said that they did not and it was first come first serve but gave no indication of how long that could be. She said, \"I am sure we can get you in soon.\" If you hear something like that you just assume that the wait is not that long. Well....we got there and the wait was an hour and a half or more. Waaaaaaaaahhhhhhhtttt??? Why wouldn't you say that over the phone? Not impressed at all. But we decided to stay. The only good thing is that the left side of the Church Brew Works is no reservations. So, if you were wily enough you could just wait for a table to open up and hope you get there fast enough to grab it.  Good news, I'm like a wily cat and grabbed a table, before they even cleared it, and we were seated 20 minutes or less after we got there. Big accomplishment! So we sat down and ordered some drinks and just looked over the menu.   That is when the server issue started. Our server was no where to be seen throughout the entire dinner experience. And even to get the check took forever. I did not see many servers and even saw two managers helping out so I just assumed they must have been short staffed.  But that and not being told that there was that long of a wait bumped them to two stars.  Food: Cup of French Onion Soup: This was actually really good. This soup was really well made and was not salty at all. It had a great flavor to it. I really enjoyed the croutons and the melted cheese on the top. I wish there was a little more cheese and less of the croutons but overall it was well made.  Lettuce Wraps: Diced southwest rubbed chicken breast tossed in a soy ginger reduction. Served with julienne carrots and zucchini noodles in an Asian sweet and sour sauce, crushed peanuts, and bibb lettuce. Umm...the chicken was served cold. The chicken was not warm it was cold. That is not something that we were expecting at all. When I think lettuce wraps I usually have had the chicken hot/warm. Not these one they were served cold. The chicken was also in chunks and not ground. I am on the fence about that. While it was easier to handle not many people could share this dish because the were not many chunks.   Side salad: This side salad was huge. I was impressed with the portion size. The blue cheese dressing was also on point. I enjoyed this the most.   Pizza: Wild Boar BBQ Slow roasted pulled wild boar, Dunkel bbq sauce, red onion, corn, mozzarella and provolone cheese. The pizza was so salty it was almost inedible to both Chris and I. AND it was $22. Nothing about this pizza was good. The pizza had too much sauce on it so it was floppy and each slice fell if you lifted it. The cheese over took the pizza and was choking. There was not a lot of the corn or red onions to counter act the taste of the bbq sauce that was not appetizing at all. And the boar was too salty as said before. I ate one slice, Chris ate one, and we ended up giving a $22 pizza away to someone who said they might want to eat it. Ugh... disappointing for sure.   I know they are good! I know I have had really good experiences here. Yesterday was just not one of them. If I go back I just hope that I don't have to write them off completely.",

Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly, but we never felt rushed (despite our very slow ordering and eating). We both ordered the pulled pork sandwich and thought it was delicious.   The only flaw was that we each ordered a beer samplers flight and I found all of the beers to be extremely heavy and dark. There were several beers in the sampler flight that neither of us liked one bit (and we have extremely different tastes when it comes to beer). Overall I prefer lighter beers and there were non of those so the flight was a big let down. If you like the beers in the flight then its a great amount of beer, but if you don't like the majority of them, it is really tough to finish.

But Word to the wise!! if you order a Moscow Mule, they will take your drivers license to make sure you don't steal the copper mugs. I suggest to just get the drink in a regular glass.      The food was Hit and miss. We ordered the homemade potato chips, which were burnt. We had a basket of fries, which were greasy and tepid.     My quesadilla, however, was great. It was a shrimp and avocado quesadilla with some kind of pineapple salsa relish on the top. The fresh jalapenos in the pineapple salsa complemented the shrimp and avocado inside the quesadilla wonderfully.     A great restaurant for hipsters who  drink IPA beer. Way too chaotic for date night or for a family night out.",

Both were also tasty. So why a 2? Terrible service. We sat at the bar. Clocked 19.5 minutes before anyone said a word to us. We stayed because we had traveled from out of state and this was a major spot for us to see. Once we got menus, it was another 10 min before our order was taken. Bartenders barely acknowledged us. No follow up on the food or if we needed anything once our food arrived. Then, sat with 2 empty pint glasses for 13 minutes. Call me weird, but it became a social experiment after awhile. Not sure why but this bar crew is lacking. Inexperienced maybe? Even the manager(s) walked through the bar area and nothing. Unfortunately, it ruined our experience. Been here, done that, most likely won't be back. If you decide to visit, do it for the venue.",

The food is also surprisingly good. I ordered the zuchini pasta dish with red pesto sauce topped with perfectly grilled chicken. The zuchini pasta was seasoned very well. I also ordered the fruity salad with vinaigrette. That was also very fresh and delicious. Love the laid back open atmosphere. The wait staff was helpful and service quick. Would highly recommend a visit.",

The inside is quite large with tons of seating, and there is an outdoor area to enjoy in the summer. I enjoyed the beer and thought they had a solid draft list, with plenty of options for all beer lovers. As for food, you cannot go wrong with the pierogis. Overall, this is a unique restaurant concept with solid food and beer - check it out!",

The interior and exterior are stunning. The structure has been magnificently preserved. We went for a sampling of beer, unlike most breweries you don't select 5 or 6 beers, you get a small shot glass of all their beers (about 12-13). We sat outside on their porch area, where it was nice and cool.   The service was wonderful, we had a service dog and are often turned away. The server brought us out a bowl of water and would refill it when our dog got low on water. The food, a little pricey was all delicious and very fresh. I highly recommend checking this place out for its great service, location, and atmosphere!",

    "text": "Church Brew Works as the name suggests is a BrewPub in a former church. The experience was unique and cool, but I guess few may find it weird to visit a big Brewery/Pub in a church. The Ambience was great, service was nice with great choice of draft beers and decent food.  These guys have renovated an old church and preserved its architectural beauty while converting it to a brewpub. There is a huge brewing equipment set at the altar, bar counter on the side and ample seating with high tables and normal ones too. We had tried the flight of beers which was a sampler of 8 drafts produced in house. The flight is ideal if you want to try a variety of beers in small quantity, especially when visiting with a group before ordering the ones you would like.   Along with the drinks, we also tried some bar food. They had really few vegan/vegetarian friendly entrees. There were a few vegetarian friendly options in the appetizers section though. The bruschetta was really great, the home chips and fries were OK and slightly greasy. I felt like the food could have been better.  Recommendations: Flight of Beers - A sampler of 8 draft beers Food: Bruschetta   Overall, its a must visit place if you are in Pittsburgh to have a unique experience of a BrewPub at a church.",

I had never seen anything like it so I was tickled by the fact that this was a church converted into a brewery.   We had a couple flights to start then we did a few rounds of beers. We also tried their food. I don't remember the exact name but we tried the pizza rolls they were pretty tasty and with beer it went great. Obsorbed all the alcohol right up.

    "text": "Church Brew Works has all the potential to be an amazing must stop bar and restaurant but unfortunately they are missing the mark in the most critical areas, food and service.  We stopped in for a drink and some appetizers on a saturday night around 8 or 9 PM. It was not very busy.  Let's start with the obvious, the space. They have converted an old church into a brewery and restaurant. Genius! The space is truly awesome and is the reason this is a 2 star and not a 1 star review. But unfortunately that is where my raving will end.  We were greeted by the most unfriendly host I have ever witnessed. She looked absolutely miserable and was not friendly whatsoever.  She barely greeted us or looked at us. Talk about an awful first impression when walking in.  There was a different girl at the stand when we left, she also did not look up and acknowledge us at all as we left, typically the hostess says to have a good night or something at least, but this girl said nothing.  Our server was nice enough but really was not good or overly friendly. He did the bare minimum and was slow to greet our table, slow to bring drinks, slow to bring the check.  And with the restauant not being very busy, slow service really isnt justifiable.  Most of the time the servers were off talking to each other or behind the bar texting and neglecting their tables.  Now onto the food and drinks.. We ordered the non traditional pierogies which were  turkey swiss and the traditional pierogies, both arrived to the table cold.  We also ordered the pizza roll which was ok and was warm.  I was very disappointed in the food, especially because we came for pierogies and then they were cold and awful.  We each ordered a beer, I don't remember which we ordered but they were both fine.  As much as I wanted to be able to tell you that this is a must stop spot in Pittsburgh, I honestly think I have to tell you to skip it.  At best, stop in for a drink and a photo.",

Portions were perfectly sized. Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful.

As noted by several other reviewers, this is a brewery located in an old church. The alter now houses the brewing equipment. The pews now seat patrons in the restaurant. I had a nice porter, hubby had an IPA and a cask beer. All were very good. Service was also prompt and friendly.   All in all, a very cool place to have a few brews.",

Liked it so much, we grabbed lunch the next day on our way out of town. If I lived here, I'd be back every week. These folks have it all down from decor to beer to food.",

This tasteful re-appropriation of a typical old church maintains all of the original design but cleverly incorporates brewery equipment. The beer is decent, as is the pizza.  On the other hand, this place really feels like a tourist trap when you compare the prices to the quality of the food. $17 for room-temperature pierogies is literally insane. For $12-$40 per person on entrees alone, you are better off going to a much better restaurant that actually feels upscale. Every time I've been there, they seem to be out of the beer I want... they are also seriously lacking in wheat beers and vegetarian options.  Like any touristy establishment that feels it can get by on \"cool\" factor alone, this really feels like theme park-level rip-off.",

I wasn't too fond of it and my sadness over the coconut beer was probably pouring into the beer.

The inside of this place was incredible.  I loved how they kept the church feel to the building, but then, of course, there's all the beer.

My cole slaw side sat in a watery sea of mayonnaise.  But the surroundings were awesome!  See it even if you just sit at the bar for a brew.",

And no, you won't hear Handel's Messiah here, just the hiss and pop of the stills. The smell of hops and barley has long ago replaced sacred incense. Imbibing home crafted brews has since supplanted conducting elaborately scripted and ritualistic rites.  And the monks would doubtlessly have had it no other way.   Places like this really bring out my inner apologist. So come to CBW to see brewing, consuming and selling alcohol in a sanctuary. Then buy a shirt, have a shot and flirt with a waitron.  The owners have truly gotten back to the whole point of Christendom.",

It's pretty awesome to look at, and it has great food and beer.  Ok beer first.  I did the Celestial Gold.  It's a pilsner beer, that tastes like a lighter version of Magic Hat's #9.  So, yeah, pretty darn good!  For a starter I had the Cajun Risotto Fritters, chorizo, peppers, onions and cheese fried with a spicy sauce.  They were very good.  For my entree I had the Shinkasa Cheesesteak .  It was Kobe beef with peppers (no onions for me) and provolone.  The sandwich was perfect.  Delicious and not greasy.  Overall it was a great experience.  I will return next time I go to Pitt.",

    "text": "I came here with my lovely trainer who was super excited to be bringing me to a church turned brewery restaurant. And frankly, so was I! Apparently, they no longer allow churches to be sold with their interior decor so this place is truly one of a kind!  First off, this place is huge so you don't have to shy away from bringing large groups. They have a small lot behind the church so do consider carpooling. You are literally walking into a church and then walk into a large brewery instead. It is really fun! There is an earthy smell to the place that I liked (kinda like beets!) You can also see some of the cook stations like the pizza and oven dishes right up by the altar!  I tried their celestial gold beer and I highly recommend it for those who enjoy lighter beers.  Now to the food. I am not a German food eater and I was new to the cuisine sans dessert so be warned. I have been told German food is an acquired taste and can go wrong if you are not familiar with it. We started off with the perogies and I loved them! So soft and tasty. When we asked for an entree recommendation from our waitress, she said the buffalo pasta was one of her favorites. Loving the safety of chicken and pasta and buffalo sauce, I ordered it. The description said buffalo cream sauce with crumbled (blue/feta?) cheese on top. I am a sucker for creamy sauces. Well, I could not get through 4 bites of anything more than the pasta in this dish and I was trying really hard. The cream sauce appeared to be plain buffalo sauce that was congregating at the bottom of the paste discussing their very liquid form. The waitress was kind enough to exchange it for an appetizer of potato cakes and dessert.   Potato cakes needed some seasoning. Their frozen peanut butter cake was perfect though.  Granted, I stayed away from their traditional plates. However, my trainer had the braised pork chop with sauerkraut and that wasn't appetizing either.   The customer service experience here was great. Our waitress was attentive and we never had to waive her down for requests (this was before and after returning my dish by the way). The hostess was also super friendly and nice. The manager also came over to apologize. I really hate when I catch a managers attention since I am not at the restaurant to make a scene so it was nice for him to come by but definitely not necessary so kudos to their crew for that.  If you come here, expect great beer and a good time.",

They brew their own beer which is good and they have creative interpretations of some ordinary dishes but my two experiences here have been horrible.  First thing, this is a microbrewery so when you say you have Jesus brew, ( I made that up) on tap don't be shocked when I dont know what it is. Maybe offer a sample, instead of offering a $20 beer tasting tray.  I asked for a hefeweizen type beer and I ended up getting something that was close to a yuengling   The food was decent but it's really expensive for what it is. The place gets very loud and the seating is cramped.  Overall if you are a tourist this is the place to go. Over priced, average food, but u get to take pictures and tell all of your friends that you were there. My advice go there, take pictures and leave",

The first pizza we tried was the Pirogie pizza.   It was pretty much flavorless (pizza, no sauce, with mash potato dumpings, covered with cheese)...   I had higher expectations.   The second pizza was pretty good.  Please note in Pittsburgh - there are some good pubs that serve great pizza - this is not one of those pubs.

My son had a personal pizza which was quite good, my wife had the cheesesteak and remarked, \"I now know why they offer/suggest double the meat.\"  While a tasty sandwich, it is a bit sparse on actual cheesesteak.  I had the teriyaki chicken sandwich on the recommendation of our server.  It was quite good - a nice grill char on the chicken and the teriyaki sauce clung to the chicken breast.  I had the nut brown beer and while decent, I'm not sure I would order that again - but saw another table with a beer flight and would certainly consider that option.    Now for the only \"food negative\" we experienced - the french fries.  The fries were cooked to perfection, but then someone dumped WAY TOO MUCH seasoning on them.  Deer could be seen coming out of the neighboring valleys searching for the salt lick.  Readers, learn from our mistake - order your fries unseasoned and add your own salt.   If I were the owner and wanted to move my restaurant up a notch, my priorities would be 1: upgrade the lighting.  While it's cool you refurbished the original pendant fixtures, the outdoor garage lighting along the sides needs to be swapped out with discreet pendants and 2:  improve upon your sound system.  Kudos goes to you for keeping the volume down so people can easily converse, but what does reach your ear is tinny and shrill.      In short, the food was good (barring the french fries), the staff was friendly, the bathrooms were very clean (!), and the ambiance was fun, and the prices were reasonable.",

Let this be an example to all cities with churches (and buildings of any type) that are sitting unused and/or derelict. This restaurant gives \"re-purpose\" a whole new meaning.   Only downside with re-purposing a building like this is the acoustics. Because the walls and ceiling don't have any shock absorbancy, sound is not absorbed and it gets *very* loud in here! We came here late at night, 9pm on a Friday. It was packed and loud. The way tables and booths are laid out gives every party privacy without putting up huge dividers. It's reminiscent of being in a mess hall or what I think of a dining area to be like in Henry VIII's court back in the Middle Ages. Just an openness you don't get in most dining experiences.   The church has pews, stained glass and a pulpit area, which has also been re-purposed into a brewing station, which may or may not be considered blasphemous!   The food was very good, though a little on the stodgy side. I made the mistake of eating some of a pierogi appetizer that my companions ordered, forgetting that I had ordered the special that night which was cheese and potato pierogis. Way too heavy; I would have been better off eating a salad. I also tried some of the spinach and cheese dip, which was incredible!!!  Of course, the main attraction is the beer. And boy, do they make good beer! I had the Octoberfest, which seemed to be the most popular. It was the best I've had. Also tried the pumpkin beer, which was delicious, as well!  Can't wait to come back here next time I'm in town.",

An old church turned into a brewery neat concept and great place to take out of town guests.  You can sit in the bar and order off the pub menu or the dining room which has a more upscale dining menu. I always ask for the pub menu as it has the pizzas and sandwiches on it.  Recommend the pizzas which they cook in their brick oven. You can't go wrong with the pierogi pizza and they also offer their homemade pierogis as an appetizer.  The pulled pork and turkey with brie sandwiches I also recommend.",

Walking in, I could not help but feel like I was in the presence of something holy. By holy, I mean holy shit, beer. We had a flight of seven 5 oz beers, most of which were pretty goddamn good. Although CBW's beer is nothing to necessarily start a religious holy-war over, I can't complain. Their rauchbier, Belgian IPA, and Belgian tripel were good enough for me to want to drink them post-resurrection. Their mint stout was a bit of a miss, but I cannot judge them for their sins. Call me a heretic if you must. But dear lord, the bison delmonico, tenderloin medalions, seared sesame tuna with cabbage, and bananas foster bread pudding made me want to convert to eat here all the time, but alas, I do not live anywhere near this fine establishment, nor state. Oh, and our waiter was great. By the end of the meal I felt like he was the Joseph to my Jesus.

    "text": "Really wish I had read some of the 1-2 star reviews before planning my fiance's birthday dinner here, which I had intended to be the perfect ending to a fun day touring Pittsburgh's breweries.     I absolutely agree with every other reviewer that the service is appalling.  We were told to sit anywhere, so we grabbed a high table near the bar. We were ignored and made to feel unwelcome by our indifferent, bored, rude server with questionable hygiene.  The server, Antonio, did not introduce himself when he initially came around to take our order, the point at which servers usually welcome you to the establishment.  (We only discovered his name from the check at the end)  He simply asked how many were in the party, presumably so he could gauge what his tip would be.  Since there were only two of us (again, intimate dinner with fiance), he decided we weren't worth much effort.  We waited a long time for him to come around to take our order, so we decided instead of ordering appetizers and really savoring our meal, we'd just get a quick pizza.   The server realized the tab wouldn't be high since I wasn't going to be drinking and we weren't ordering soups, salads, or any appetizers so he decided right then we weren't worth even the most basic level of service.    When the pizza finally came out, it had a 3-inch long curly black hair on it.  Both my fiance and I are dirty blonds, and the hair uncannily matched our lackadaisical server's unkempt black hair and unruly beard.    (hey I got nothing against beards by the way, my honey's got one, but this guy could use some trimmers)   After the hirsute discovery, we waited another 20 minutes or so for him to come around and check to see how the meal was so that I could point out the hair.  He didn't seem bothered but offered to get a new pizza for us, which took another 30 minutes.   The pizza was so-so, and we had to wonder the whole time if there was anything 'extra' deposited in there by the annoyed waiter.  No surprise we waited a VERY VERY long time for the check.  I was considering just walking out but finally my fiance flagged down a waitress, told her we hadn't seen our server in a long time.  She asked for his name, which we didn't know at that point, and then asked for a physical description.  Since this place has 30 high- school/college-aged kids working there, our description happened to fit that of another dark-haired, beardy unkempt kid walking by.   (I know I'm making myself sound old here, but I've reached my third decade and I feel I've earned it, I have worked in the service industry and it's not that hard to provide the minimum level of service and courtesy).  FINALLY, Antonio appeared, perfunctorily provided the check and finally gratefully we were on our way.  I wanted to complain to management, but I never saw any, and based on some other reviews, I doubt it would have accomplished anything.  It seems management is going out of their way to teach bad manners to the waitstaff.  Oh and the gimmick of being in an old church with pretty stained glass windows and brewery equipment where the altar once was, wears off real quick.     First and last time here.  Ruined our night and put a sour taste in our mouth after a day which had been fun up until this stop.  Not only will we NEVER go back here, we won't be buying their beers at any distributor ever again.    Do not come here on a special occasion, in fact, don't waste your time or money here at all.   There are plenty of other awesome microbreweries opening up who will be serving food, and eventually may put this dump out of business.",

The menu is pretty large, but your best choice is in the pizza options, which tend to be fresher and more flavorful than the sandwiches and entrees. Beer is decent.  Plus: A large space with big tables.  Minus: noisy, chaotic, slow service  Plus: They always have peirogi (usually traditional plus a rotating nontraditional pierogi)  Minus: Not very good food (a friend of mine ordered this \"pierogi casserole\" dish that was super greasy and overcooked).   If you want to take your out-of-town guests out for pierogi, I recommend Butterjoint instead, they have excellent food and drinks.",

My friend and I stopped by to try the beer and maybe an appetizer endemic to the area. 3 hours later and 6 beers in we tried the traditional pierogies. It was delicious and even though it was cooked it tasted very fresh. However what I really want to review is the beer. As recommended by our bartender we tried the goh-suh, and it was exquisite! Tasted like a combination of mimosa and margaritas, which to me is a delightful experience. I highly recommend The Church Brew Works!",

    "text": "As a conference attendee who goes to Pittsburgh once a decade, it was fun to find this local gem that was admittedly a little far flung from the tourists in Oakland and the greater downtown area.   The restaurant is in a beautiful old church, and it has been restored and repurposed nicely to reflect a casual atmosphere. We got there at 5 on wednesday, and it was dead until about 7 when a bunch of people came in. I got the sampler, which is a LOT of beer. 8 small 4(?) oz glasses of local brew are put in front of you, though the names are hard to remember and the waitress went over them too quickly.   Decent food, your typical pub food. The ambiance is really what this location is all about. I would return again for drinks and snacks only, I think.",

The building is an old church and declared a historic landmark. They brew a variety of beer here, which makes it a fun trip for a beer lover. Typically I think the food is good, however I never had a dish that I would specifically make the trip for. On my most recent visit the service was inconsistent however the waitress was very nice. If it gets pretty busy the noise can carry oddly and make it hard to hear. They have something on the menu for everyone but it can get pretty pricey for some items. I like that food items that have some Pittsburgh flair to them, which really adds to the experience. Also, the bar has seasonal cocktails and offers mixed drinks and wine in addition to their in house brews.",

    "text": "The novelty of the setting can only carry your experience so far. The food itself was sad and frustrating - especially considering the price of some dishes.  As I looked over the menu, I noticed one consistency: most dishes sounded very ordinary or even boring except for one or two incongruous ingredients. It is as if they are trying to make everything different or special by adding an arbitrary distinction.  My dinner started with the Seven Onion soup. Arbitrary Distinction #1. Are onions really so varied in flavor once cooked in broth and cheese that using seven varieties will create a nuanced dish? Well, it was decent but no different than French Onion soup anywhere else, made with six fewer onions no doubt.  After the dinner menu failed to pique my appetite, I ordered the Turkey and Swiss sandwich from the pub menu. It arrived on pumpernickel slices, plain and untoasted like an elementary school lunch. This brown bagger of a sandwich consisted of dry turkey crumbles paired with greens and red onion but no moisture. The occasional taste of cranberry? Arbitrary distinction #2. I found myself painting it in ranch dressing and sucking down water just to be able to swallow without choking.  One table mate ordered the mussels dish. I noticed him rubbing the white sauce from the meat onto the garlic bread and I soon realized why. After biting into the bread with the sauce, I found myself being force to spit it into a napkin. The white sauce was so salty, bus loads of Jewish tourists could float on the surface of it. The bread was harshly peppered. They were inedible.  Another table mate's dish included a lemon aioli (#3) that was runny and astringent, as if flavored with Pledge Multisurface. Another had the southwesty wrap (I forget the name) and only ate the insides. The reason was a tortilla that was spicy enough to choke a person (#4). Want to dip your fries in my chipotle ketchup (#5)? I'll pass.  I'm glad that the service was attentive because my palate needed those four water refills. Some advice, Brew Works? Pick a dish one at a time and refine it. Make it delicious. Your food doesn't need novelty condiments and bizarre pairings to be unique and memorable. It just needs to be good.",

The entrees are a bit too pricy for what you get, so I'd probably steer clear of those and get the bar menu.   I don't drink a lot of microbrews, but I have enjoyed the specialty cocktails. In the fall and winter, I highly recommend the hot cider with spiced rum.   The service here is generally not very good. It is pretty slow and sporadic, especially if you go with a big group.  The most annoying and inconsistent thing about going to the Church is how they handle reservations. They used to take them, but apparently now they don't. Sometimes they will take a \"call ahead,\" which is essentially a reservation, and sometimes they won't.  Sometimes they require your whole party to be there before they will seat you; other times they don't. I wish they would figure out how to deal with this seemingly easy task.",

Another half hour goes by and still no food. We asked to see the manager and we explained the situation to him and his response was \"I don't know what to tell you. I have been busy working the line in the kitchen\". As it turns out, the genius waiter had put our order in to go and gave it to another table that took the food and left.

    "text": "Some parts of me really loves it here, but I will tell you after my last experience I'm not sure that I will go back. The ambiance is really cool, so there's that. It's a unique experience being in an old church drinking your beer. With that being said, I do enjoy their beers! If only they put that much love into their food. It's also one of the convenient places to go in the city because it has a parking lot. Anyway, our waiter had a pretty bad attitude and our food took FOREVER! After waiting for about an 1 1/2 hours we finally got our dinner at 9 pm. Mine was decent, but another member of our party ordered a hot sandwich was straight up cold. He politely asked to have the hot sandwich he ordered and the waiter unhappily took it back saying they will remake it. Well their \"remake\" all of a sudden came back out a minute later clearly microwaved because it was still cold in the middle. We all just continued on with our meals at this point because we were hungry. For the cost of the food this is just ridiculous. After the super slow service and being there way longer than we wanted and needed to be we were ready to leave. There are so many better places to eat and drink in Pittsburgh these days and Church brew Works has not kept up with the level of competition in the area now. So I'd head elsewhere to spend you money because the food and service is not worth it here!",

The beers were unique, but not awesome, and one of them came in a glass that hadn't been rinsed thoroughly; it tasted like dishwasher soap. We both know beer, and this wasn't right. It wasn't some kind of cilantro beer or anything.  We ordered the homemade chips, which were delightful, before setting off to the next destination.",

I know it's because of the brewery and the yeast they use for the beer. But ugh....I can't shake it. I smell it when I come in, I smell it when I eat and I smell it on me after I leave.   It's such a shame too because the place is just gorgeous! Obviously, it used to be a church and they've kept a lot of the original stain glass windows. Even the pews and tables you sit at are originally from the church.   I.just.can't.take.the.smell.   Also, I'm not really a fan of the beer they brew. I've tried it a bunch of times and it just never seems to stand out for me. The food is not bad either. I've had the pizza's, which are offered in a variety of different types. I seriously just can't take the smell.   I'm sure I'll get talked into going again sometime, but hopefully it's in the summer when I can sit outside. The outside does have a great set up. Plus, you don't have the smell.   I'm sure the point has come across the smell wasn't there I'd probably not mind the place. It doesn't bother my friends as much as it bothers me, so maybe I'll just chalk it up to having a strong sense of smell.  I'm totally ok with that when it's good smelling things, I swear!",

We ordered the veggie spaghetti ($17) and buffalo chicken pierogies ($18). Mind you, we are a couple who doesnt mind paying a higher price for a good meal. I originally wanted to try one of their wood fire oven pizzas but the only option was to order a large pizza for $20 which isnt an option for a single person. They do have a lunch portion but i was unable to order ir because they dont serve lunch portions on weekends (it was 1pm on a friday afternoon). It took over 30 mins to get our food and they weren't even busy. Both dishes tasted aweful and we only ate a few bites of each before asking for the check. We told the waiter the food was terrible and that we were leaving hungry and he didn't even apologize or get a manager. When we asked for a manager, we were told there wasn't one available. As 2 people who work in the restaurant industry, this was absolutely appalling to us.  Drinks: the beer and wine is excellent. While waiting for our food, we tried 2 different beers and a reisling, all very good and well priced. Although we did wait a long time for each drink we ordered, we didn't mind so much because they were good.   To conclude this review, we do reccommend trying the beer, which is what they are known for, but definitely don't waste your time or money eating here.",

    "text": "I've been to Church Brew Works several times and will say it was very impressive on my first visit. However, each visit after I was less and less satisfied. First of all, it is a spectacle to see. The Church itself and stain glass decor is beautiful. The brewing equipment on display at the alter is in plain view and for anyone into brewing it is fun to look at. I mean, they turned a Church into a brewery!  If you are even remotely curious, I suggest you at least go for a drink and look around.  Speaking of drinks, that was my main draw as my love for craft beer put a big bullseye on this destination. The first visit I did a flight which had their standard 6 or 7 beers like Pious Monk and Thunder Hop along with a rotating tap or 2. I believe the flight had 8 decent size samples for $13 or so. Now that first visit was great and I took all of the beers in. After a few more visits I can say that only the Pious Monk and Thunder Hop are memorable.  The rotating tap is usually decent but the rest is not very good for my tastes. I enjoy IPAs and full body beers. These to me lack flavor and just come off as average domestics.  No complexity and watered down.  If I go back I will stick with what I know I like and see what the rotating tap is. You can get growlers to go for a very reasonable price which I've done before.  One nice summer day I was in and sat on the patio which is very nice and enclosed with flag decor. I ordered a Dark N' Stormy (dark rum and ginger beer over ice with lime) and I must say it is the best thing I have ever had at Church Brew Works!  And the best Dark N' Stormy I've had anywhere. I don't know what they do but they should keep doing it.  The food much like the seating is split into two distinct categories. Pub side and Dinner side. Pub is more traditional bar foods and is cheaper where Dinner is more upscale and a jump in price. I generally go for Pub side seating on the left (dinner to the right) along with that menu since it's usually a quick stop for drinks. I've had dinner as well but in my opinion it is all small portioned and very bland though the presentation looks very nice.  The last few times I've gone I have skipped food all together.  I should also mention that they have oven baked pizzas but again, small and bland. But they look nice.  I'm just not impressed by the food options verse price compared to other breweries I've been to.    The service has always been top notch and friendly. The place is clean and huge so there is hardly ever a wait unless you have a big group. It is definitely somewhere you should check out for yourself and make a decision. Worthy of a trip just to say you've been there and see the spectacle but there are better brewery choices in the area.",

Check. Pierogie pizza? Check. The last time I was here we had the traditional pierogies, they were fried perfectly and served with onions and sour creme. We also enjoyed the dry rubbed pork pierogies with a sriracha sour cream. The flavor was amazing, but they weren't cooked as good as the traditional. Lastly we had the spinach feta and smoked gouda dip. I really enjoyed it, but there wasn't enough dip vs. the amount of chips provided. I really didn't get a feta taste, the gouda and spinach worked well together. Obviously this place is beautiful on the inside and it's a unique place to enjoy dinner. The alter area consists of the brew tanks, the confessional is a liquor cabinet, the chairs are repurposed pews, the list of creativity goes on and on. If you aren't an alcohol drinker, the house brewed birch beer is worth a try. The service can be hit or miss, not amazing, but not terrible. My biggest complaint is pricing. I would say the food prices run a little high given the portion and quality. Not by much, about a $1 on appetizers and $3 on entrees. I will return again when I am in town and look forward to trying new items.  *The pizza oven has burned, but should be back up and running 9 months.",

There are some interesting items on the menu.  Pros: Great location Private parking lot Food is tasty Service is always good The Brewmisu dessert is fantastic  Cons: It can be a bit pricey for the type of food The beer is good, but not fantastic Because it's an old church the smell of old wood sort of envelops the air  All in all, it's a fun place to visit.  If you have family or friends from out of town, they'll enjoy the uniqueness of the place.",

As three waitresses came to help clean up I mentioned to our waitress that I sure hope we don't have to pay for them as I am wearing them but........I paid the bill and my sister said did she charge for the drinks and sure enough I had to wear the drinks and pay for them as well.  What kind of customer service is that, POOR........  don't think I will go back.",

The kids menu was not very appealing to a child and there were no substitutions allowed. ( so the waitress claimed ) also we asked for a new waiter because our initial waitress had a terrible attitude and was acting very disrespectful towards my husband . Cutting him off mid sentence and scowling when he asked questions about the menu items . I even asked her if there was something \"we\" did to cause her to be so rude towards us . She proceeded to go back and forth with me insisting there was no problem with her behavior . Our new waiter was polite but after the confrontation I had with the initial waitress I lost my appetite anyway . Plus the menu items seemed to be mostly spicy foods which I do not eat . We won't be coming back here . Especially when there are so many other great places in the area . Sorry brew works .",

BUT, they more than make up with the breathtakingly beautiful location, the selection of beers, and the friendly service.  Even after the kitchen screwed up my friend's order twice, they still get a thumbs up for service, it was that good.  I got the flight, and I found a few beers that I fell in love with, and bought a growler.  A great place to visit when in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "One of the most striking restaurant settings I have encountered is the Church Brew Works in Pittsburgh. The restaurant is located in a former Catholic church and a large one at that. St. John the Baptist Church opened in 1907 in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Lawrenceville. But in 1993, with the consolidation of several Pittsburgh parishes, the church was closed and deconsecrated. The church building was purchased and repurposed as the Church Brew Works, opening in 1996. The renovation of the building retained many of its features, including the stained glass windows, a side chapel, the wooden floor, and the altar reredos. Tables and booths replaced the pews and brewery vats were placed in the altar area.  Entering the restaurant continues to give the feel of entering a church. It is a very striking picture and the size of the enterprise is surprising. Does the food match its setting? I'd say it does. We arrived for lunch and were seated nearly in the middle of the former nave. First off was a appetizer of Untraditional Pierogies appetizer. This zesty turn on the Polish (and Pittsburgh) staple featured chicken and a salsa topping. I ordered a Buffalo Burger with cheddar cheese and bacon and Susan the Traditional Pittsburgh Style Salad. The salad included grilled chicken, but Susan asked for it without the traditional French fries mixed in. The Buffalo Burger (made with Buffalo meat) was great! Cooked to a nice Medium and very tasty and juicy.  On a second visit, we came for dinner. I ordered a House Salad to start and Pierogie Saute as a main. The Pierogie Saute came with five pierogies in a cream sauce tossed with with broccoli and tomatoes. It was delicious! Too, it was not as heavy a meal as one might imagine.  The restaurant also has pizza and other very interesting sounding main dishes on its menu. As it is a brewpub, a number of draft and bottled beers are available, with featured brews listed on a chalkboard.  Definitely recommended!",

We had extra time to kill so we ended up here after a recommendation by a friend. We have a church to brewery in Indianapolis, let's just say it does not compare!   The entrance to this place is almost like a stop and pause moment. The architecture in the building is still so beautiful! They kept so much of the original features that is truly makes it a one of a kind place.   The beer I ordered wasn't my favorite, but I'm not basing any of my review off of that. It was a time where I thought I liked pumpkin, ordered a pumpkin stout and could not drink it. The buffalo cauliflower is hands down the best buffalo item I've ever had. I crave buffalo sauce in everything imaginable and that hit the spot!   The service was great while we were there! We did notice the manager scold our waitress for texting in the bathroom. It was a little odd to hear the conversation but she was doing a fab job so it didn't really matter.   PARKING! Free parking behind the building   Next time: Order buffalo cauliflower, no blue cheese, add side of ranch. Of course don't make the mistake of ordering a pumpkin stout again.",

My friend and I got their beer sampler - $12.95 as of 2017! Came in 8 different kinds. My friend loved the IPAs and I loved a pale ale and lager. I wish I wrote the name of the lager because it was something I would drink everyday!   Food: 3 stars. Or maybe 3.5 since 3 sounds too harsh. We got bar foods to go along with the beer: fries, nachos, and pierogis. Foolproof bets for food. But fries were little stale, nachos had a ton of chips and not too much toppings, pierogis were decent but nothing to write home about (I mean pierogis never can be bad. Lk that's their definition almost).   Decor/ambience/etc: THE REASON YOU GO HERE. It's a church. With beer. I think that's the selling point. It's really pretty inside. Worth going when you're in Pittsburgh on a visit.",

There was no wait time, and the service was pretty fast.  On the menu side of things, however, things were a little limited. They had things available on their online menu that were not available in the restaurant. They rotate things on and off their menu on a confusing basis; even the waiter said that the beer menu was \"lying to you.\" There was only one vegetarian entree besides salads, which was very disappointing, and it was a little flavorless. However, I'm still giving it three stars because of the quick, kind service.",

    "text": "Driving around Pittsburgh in search of the quintessential Pittsburgh dining experience, we motored past the Church Brew Works and had to stop. A church? An altar mounted with brewing equipment, producing luscious beers worthy of the Viking gods?   We hit the brakes and parked the car. I've never spent more than a few minutes in a church save for the requisite dull hum of a wedding ceremony, so I was rather amazed at the scale of the place. The literal cathedral ceiling, tables as far as the eye can see, a lone pizza man plying his trade just to the right of the altar, where beer was in process before being transferred to kegs or bottles and served at the restaurant. The church, oddly, has the feel of an Eastern European brewhouse; outside of the setting, it doesn't have much character or charm.  We ordered perogis and pizza. The perogis were good, but the pizza wasn't anything special. The crust was too sweet and too short, the sauce lack brightness or vigor, and the cheese just sat there, holding the whole thing together. The beer really stood out as the star of the show. I had the summer special hefeweizen, and my companion had the IPA x2. We loved them both.   This is definitely a must-see for anyone passing through town. Come for beers and atmosphere, but plan to have your dinner elsewhere.",

The interior definitely did not disappoint!  The sanctuary is gorgeous, with stained glass windows, gothic architecture, and old pews scattered throughout.  I would say the ambiance and beer were 4 stars and the food was probably a 3.5.  (I tried their holiday beer, which was a dark french beer and was quite tasty.)  The appetizer selection was extensive and I really enjoyed the smoked gouda/feta/spinach dip.  This place is also known for their pizzas, so I'd recommend skipping the rest of the entrees and just going for that.  I got their famous pierogie pizza, which was good, but needed an extra kick...like onions or olives, perhaps.  Overall, it's worth the experience and if you need a place for a large group, I'd recommend it!",

Even though they brew their own been on the former alter, store their liquor in the old confessionals, and make their pizza pies where the old organ used to play, they kept all the stained glass, high ceilings, and rose window from this place. While I did feel somewhat sinful eating and drinking there, my experience here was excellent.   We had been drinking all day, so that did not stop there. Nice mix of homemade beers from pilsner to stout. GF ordered a french onion soup that was delicious. Table ordered a white pizza with chicken and spinach which was decent. Customer service was excellent here. I joked with the server that for working at a place like this, her penance would be that she had to carry around the extra heavy menus. She agreed on commented how it was tough with 10 toppers. The mgr, Phil, saw I was wearing a Chicago Bears shirt and start making fun of it with another employee. Of course, I started jawing back and forth with him. He came over to the table and was very friendly. He comped a round of drinks and I asked him where I could buy some of their pint glasses (see photo, glass says on the 8th day man created beer). He came back with 4 glasses for our table on the house. Saved me the trouble of having to steal them. haha.   If you can get past the place that this place used to be a church, you are in for a treat at this place. I would recommend it to all.",

We went with a good sized group (7 of us) and sat outside - initially.  We ordered a few beer samplers and hummus to start - hummus never came, but we didn't care b/c we also got the special perogies.    Then - the rain came - the manager opened the fancy-shmancy awning....to no avail - the rain kept coming down harder.  Just as our server was bringing our entrees - we were making our way inside to avoid the deluge.  Fortunately we had no problem getting an inside table to enjoy our meals.  Our vegetarian friends weren't impressed at all with their meals (it's definitely more meat-friendly of a menu).  However, my partner and I shared:  appetizer perogie, crab cake entree, and a side of poblano mac and cheese.  We ate every last little nibble - and it was all fantastic.    The beers were very good too!  All of this was just capped off by the beautiful architecture and decor within the old church.  Next time we're in Pittsburgh, we're definitely going back!",

When the beer was gone, Jesus' mother said to Him, \"They have no more beer.\" \"Dear woman, why do you involve me,\" Jesus replied, \"My time has not yet come.\" His mother said to the servants, \"Do whatever He tells you.\"  Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind the Jews use for ceremonial washing, each holding from 20 to 30 gallons. Jesus said to the servants, \"Fill the jars with water,\" so they filled them to the brim. Then He said to them, \"Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.\"  They did so and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into Beer. He did not realize where it had come from although the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside and said, \"Everyone brings out the India Pale Ale first and then the Pale Blue Ribbon after the guests have had too much to drink, but you have saved the best till now.\"  This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He thus revealed His Glory and the disciples put their faith in Him. (John 2:1-11)",

The food is tolerable, though overpriced. The beer is nothing to write home about. The service is deplorable. Once you get over the truly awe-inspiring sight of an altar devoted to beer-making, and the sheer monstrous scale of the place, you're in a cavernous barn with several hundred of your closest friends (not to mention a pair of roving musicians---think German-style mariachis).  This place is *loud*.  The restoration of the sanctuary is beautiful, and the placement of the brewing equipment on the former altar is an inspired choice, but that and ten bucks should get you a burger and a good beer at Tessaro's up the road---so try that instead.  (By the way, while a few previous reviewers have mentioned that smoking is allowed in the restaurant, PA recently (9/08) banned smoking in most public places, including restaurants.  CBW is now non-smoking.)",

    "text": "4 stars for the building: How cool is it to have a church for beer, with a big primary fermenter in the choir area?  (I didn't go over and check it out, but I think that's what it was.)  Only downside is that they did very little in the way of sound design, so you're surrounded by a constant roar with even a moderate crowd - not good for conversation.  2 stars for everything else:  Beer's really not that good.  It tastes like they're rushing it - the alcohol and sweetness taste like homebrew that I open too soon, before all the flavors have settled down and the more complex ones have developed.  It makes sense to do this as a small, maybe undercapitalized, brewer, because those tanks represent a couple of thousands of dollars of malt and hops.  Best to start getting a return on them ASAP instead of keeping them stored away for a couple of weeks to finish up.  (I've tried several, but their bottled stuff comes across the same way.)  Food is all over the place.  The $9 fish sandwich is a thin slab of freezer cod fried and served on a 12\" grocery store Italian loaf with no toppings at all, and I had to ask for an extra sauce cup of Tartar sauce to have enough for any semblance of flavor.  (This was the first time in a long while that I've left food on my plate.  Granted, it was a lot of bread, but I wasn't full: I just didn't want to swallow any more of the sandwich.)  Sweet potato fries were okay, but my friend's French onion soup was actually pretty good.  Service was par - nothing special, but no complaints.  Last upside is that they do take credit cards, which is, unfortunately, not a given in Pittsburgh.",

My room mates and I went here for a celebratory meal, this being my first week in Pittsburgh.  Our waitress was super friendly and helpful.  We ordered the brew sampler (the dunkel and the stout are definitely my speed), which included some seasonal beers.  I'm looking forward to what they might brew this winter.  Additionally we ordered the Spinach, Gouda & Feta dip as an appetizer and it was nothing short of spectacular, I highly recommend it (comes with pita triangles).  We shared a Chicken & Andouille pizza which tasted good with its high quality ingredients, including fresh tomatoes.  Whenever you feel like chillin' in a church, sippin' a brew (which for some people might be every Sunday), this is the place to go.",

    "text": "I was in Pittsburgh for work and one of the local guys suggested we try the Church Brew.  I'm not very familiar with Pittsburgh, but this place was somewhat out of the way.  It didn't have many interesting things around it.  Basically it's a bar/brewery built into an old abandoned church.  The place has been restored and is truly beautiful inside, with gorgeous stained glass windows, church pews, alter, and of course dining tables.    We sat down and I watched as 4 of the waitstaff walked by without acknowledging out existence.  It turns out one of the waitstaff that ignored us, was our waiter.  Eventually he stopped by and took our drink order.  I ordered the Mexican Mole Stout, which was pretty good.  As the name suggests, it is a stout with mole spices.  I like stouts and love spicy food, so this was a must try.  As I said, it was good, but far from refreshing, so I suggest a glass of water with it.    After some time, our waiter again decided he should stop by and take a food order.  We both ordered the Shinkasa Cheese Steak because I was after all in PA...not Philly, but PA nonetheless.  When it finally arrived the sandwich was very good, but overpriced at $11 for it's size.  The fries portion was also small, but they were not that great anyway.  We waited again for the bill after completing our meals.  I would have actually ordered another beer because I wanted to try another of their varieties, but our waiter never returned.  My review gets 3 stars mostly based on the very cool setting of a brewery being in a church and the Mexican Mole Stout being tasty.  However the food is overpriced and the service was poor.  Cool place to try once, but I wouldn't consider this a \"must see\".",

Fortunately, the beer and food stand up equally well and made for a tremendously enjoyable evening.  We were in town for a pre-Christmas get away and went to CBW for dinner on a Wednesday night.  We feared the worst when we pulled into the side street and the their lot to see it quite full and figured that were in for a wait inside.  Thankfully, our concerns were unfounded as the place was busy but not crowded.  We sat on the \"pub\" side to the left of the aisle.  Our server arrived promptly with drink menus and quickly gave excellent descriptions of all of their seasonal beers.  I go to a lot of brewery restaurants and one of my biggest peeves are servers who have no clue about the product that they are trying to sell.  It was a pleasure to hear someone enthusiastically describe their beers.  I settled on the Mexican Mole Stout.  It was peppery and complex yet really balanced and enjoyable.  It didn't feel \"contrived\" like many infused beers.  After that, I went on to the barleywine ad have to say it was excellent as well with lots of alcohol warmth, complex malt tastes and very nice notes of the bourbon aging.  My wife enjoyed the SteamHammer very much.  As an appetizer, we couldn't turn down the fired risotto balls.  They were a wonderful treat and I'm going to try to replicate this recipe.  For dinner we settled on the portabello mushroom pizza and it was equally good and adequately portioned.  Highly recommended restaurant.",

I was there for the food.  The pro:    - Service is good.  Attentive, prompt, friendly and very competent.  Even on a VERY crowded Saturday night when the place was absolutely packed.   The con:  - Bland and poorly done food.  The soup was tasteless.  The bison rib-eye was all gristle.  Wilted lettuce on the salad and if there was ANY dressing on it, I couldn't taste it.  The fries were typical dive-bar fare.  The only exception were the two pizzas at our table.  Both were very good.    So I guess if you're looking for great beer and tasty pizza, this is your place.  If you want good food, done well, head somewhere else.  HINT:  We had a reservation but were told that we'd have to wait about 30 minutes \"until our table was ready.\"  We saw a bunch of empty tables in the bar area and asked if we could wait there and have a drink (or three).  When the server arrived, she said that we could order from the full menu in the \"bar.\"  So if you're stopping by and the \"dining room\" is packed, head to the bar and have dinner there.

No, but it was tasty and enjoyable as far as road food goes.  Was it the most amazing beer I've ever had? I don't know--I'm not exactly a beer snob. Was it a great place to kick back some beers with a colleague and a business partner? Definitely.  Sure beat eating in the hotel restaurant, or a mega-chain which is guaranteed to be uninspired and uninspiring fare.  As we left, I noticed they have a veggie patch out back.

A couple of nice surprises:  the Untraditional Pierogies, Cajun chicken, mildly spiced; Lemon Scented Quinoa Salad (with Bibb lettuce, cucumbers, red onion, cilantro, peas and lemon-sesame dressing), tart dressing, pungent with ginger, nice crispness from the diced vegetables, great foil for the mild grilled shrimp.  The Shinkasa Cheesesteak (Morgan Ranch Kobe beef, grilled onions and red peppers, and melted provolone on a baked roll) was above average for quality of meat, but just ordinary for a sandwich as a whole; needed some condiment or accent (acid? heat? crispness?).  The Poblano Mac 'n' Cheese was a nice mac 'n' cheese, creamy and cheesy, but only faintly heated by the poblano.  Great atmosphere for groups, service was prompt and civil.  A great time was had by all.",

Awesome.  The pierogies we had were great, but not very hot. Maybe warm. And then because our table was under some kind of arctic air vortex, the pierogies became cold rather quickly. *IMPORTANT* Make sure you bring a sweatshirt when you go here!  My couscous salad was okay, but it had too much tangy stuff on it. It was a spinach salad with couscous, then it had goat cheese (tangy), marinated artichoke hearts (tangy), and a red pepper vinaigrette (very tangy, and too much of it).  You should probably go here if you come to Pittsburgh, but you might want to just come and order bar food, not actually like for-real entre things. And since I don't drink beer, I can't comment on the brews, but one member of my group had a lighter-colored beer and it looked like she was enjoying it.",

The reason to check out Church Brew Works, aside from the great pizza, is the beer.  This micro-brew has the tanks on the alter and a wonderful selection of local brews.

Kind of messed up, sort of.  Though, let's not lie, you know it's pretty cool.  The food that I had was good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We had the feta cheese/spinach pizza which had a generous amount of vegetables and crust that was just a tad bit undercooked for my liking, but still decently tasty.  The appetizer (perogies) and desert (blueberry ice cream and chocolate mousse) were all excellent.    I'm giving this place three stars, because while I think it's solid, I don't think it's all that it's cracked up to be.  The beer selection doesn't look all that extensive, though I suppose you'd like it if you're big into craft brews.  The food is somewhat pricey and from what I had, I could think of a few other places where I'd rather eat for the price I'm paying.    Then again, I'm weird and this is just me.  This place is a Pittsburgh tradition, I suppose.  Try it out at least for the ambiance.  It certainly is interesting...",

    "text": "I always respected CBW if only because these guys were way ahead of the craft beer revival.  They opened in 1996. Think about how crappy the beer landscape was back then. Yeah I was like 8 years old but if I had been older I would've been faced with the choice between Bud/Miller/Coors or worse. Penn Brewery (opened 1986!) and this place were pretty much the shining rays of hope in a thoroughly uninteresting universe of beer sameness.   So yeah, having a local spot churning out fresh and creative offerings must have been awesome back then.  But now, I'm sorry to say there's just too much out there that is better and readily available. I find the regular beers here too safe and the more adventurous ones to be unrefined in execution or just bad ideas to start with.    Here's what I do like: the atmosphere, outdoor seating, pizzas, and especially the nontraditional pierogi of the day. This inspired me to do all kinds of crazy stuff to Mrs. T's at home. Just throw anything on, seriously. I have yet to find something that tastes bad...sriracha, frank's red hot, dinosaur bbq, sweat & sour chili from trader joes, a million others, it's impossible to go wrong.   But despite this whole Pierogi Picasso thing it inspired, the focus is still the beers, and until I see some better output I can't imagine returning frequently.",

It is a great setting, I love the concept and I am convinced that they are on the edge of really having something special.  However, at the end of the day the food is letting down what has the potential to be an awesome overall experience.  Tonight I had the meatloaf.  I'm not a big fan of meat loaf, but as is one of their signature dishes so I thought I'd try it.  Ugkh!  The entire meal was incredibly salty, way over salty.  I mean borderline inedible.  The meatloaf itself was dry and not appealing and the rest of the plate just went down hill from there.   My wife had the Salmon.  Salmon is usually a pretty safe dish, but in this case it was again, a little dry and just not appetizing.   However, the it came with similar sides to the meatloaf and bam there goes the saltiness again.  Our three kids had three different meals, hard to screw up pasta or perogies or pizza.  Well you would think, except the pizza arrived a good 5 minutes after the other meals, was overcooked and again heavily salted.    All in all we want to like this place.  The staff are always friendly, as they were again tonight, and I'll admit to having a soft spot for their Celestial Gold, but we may have to take a break for a while.  Been stung once too often lately to be going back anytime soon.  I really hope that they sort out their food.",

Granted, it's a long way away in PA, but thankfully I get to take regular trips to get my pierogi and church fix.   Not like I really needed a church fix.  Anyway, here's my lowdown: - Get the beer sampler and then choose the beer you want. That is, of course, if you don't already live in Pittsburgh and don't know what the hell kind of beer they brew.  - Then get the IPA. It's hoptastic.  - Order some pierogies. There are two types - unusual and usual. Why get usual? Go for the unusual.  - Then there's a pierogi pizza. If you're getting the pierogi appetizer you probably don't need a whole pizza. But I'm real tempted to go back and try it because honestly, pierogi pizza. Some Italian Russian is spinning in his grave.  - Skip the pulled pork sandwich and beer cheese. Neither is all that good or special or memorable.  Oh - and make sure you use the bathroom. I don't know about the men's room, but the ladies is awesome. It's like a choir green room in a bar! A BAR IN A CHURCH! AH!!!!!!  And the booths use the pews for chairs! Gar! I love this place.",

It's a great place to take family who have never been there- the fact that it is a brewery in a church makes it a unique experience before you even order a drink or food item. Do not fret because it is in Lawrenceville- it's not in the hustle and bustle of Butler Street and they have their own parking lot. There is also straight parking available if need be.   The church itself is huge and it's beautiful. I LOVE that they were able to save this building and use it in such a creative way. Upon arriving, you have a choice between sitting in the bar area or dining area. We chose the dining area, but did ask our server for the bar menu as well (the pizzas and sandwiches were listed only on this menu). Since it has been a while for me, I decided to order the sampler- which allowed me to try 6 different beers. One complaint is that their beer menu is a little confusing to read and the paper they place the beers on do not state each beer they have. Our server named off the beers she gave me, but by the time I made it to the seasonals, I could not remember the names of the beers. Next time, I know to drink the seasonals first, when the names have not disappeared from my brain. Not to mention, their samplers are expensive- $9-$10 for 6 little beers. Although, I do have to say that their beer was pretty decent! None of their regular brews were strong and they all were easy to drink. Although I appreciated those qualities, I would have appreciated a little more complexity in their taste. One of the seasonals I tried was their thunderhop, which REALLY impressed me. Anything with fruity notes and hops, I usually love and this one was no different! The flavors were perfect.  My boyfriend wanted the corn dog appetizer to start. Three huge, fresh corn dogs were presented to us- with a spicy ketchup and a honey mustard on the side. We really enjoyed them and could tell they were homemade by their quality. For our meals, I ordered the pierogi saute (potato and cheese pierogis with garlic cream sauce, tomatoes, broccoli and fresh herbs), the boyf ordered a steak sandwich with fries and his mom ordered the traditional  appetizer size pierogi. My original choice was the Caribbean chicken wrap, so long as the chicken could be warm, instead of chilled. My server explained that could not be done- which led me to assume the wraps were premade, which turned me off.   I was really impressed with my pierogis. The sauce was creamy and not overpowering with garlic, the pierogis were perfect and the broccoli and tomatoes were fresh and delicious. The fresh herbs brought all of the flavors together, making the entire dish absolutely delicious. The only odd thing was that the tomatoes were cold- which was a little offsetting. My boyf was not impressed with his steak sandwich and said it tasted like \"steak umms\". After looking at the steak, I would guess that he was right about that. He didn't hate it though and was able to eat it- but wouldn't order it again. His mom loved her traditional pierogis and raved about them the whole meal.   Our waitress gave us two boxes for our meals and even wrote what our dishes were, CBW and the date on each box. I found that to be extremely awesome and helpful!   Overall, I think this place is famous for their pierogis, pizzas and beer and I probably won't steer off of that path. Our service was great, the food was delicious and the beers were good- it was a very good experience.  PS--if you sign up for their e-mail mailing list, you get a free CBW pint glass! Pretty sweet deal!",

I also had a flight of beer which I enjoyed greatly. Caitlin R. our server also went above and beyond. She was very helpful and offered suggestions to other local places that we should check out. The best of all this place also had a parking lot...which seems a rare find in Pittsburgh. We would gladly return here if we take a trip to Pittsburgh again.",

Granted, I'm from NYC.  Anyway, they told us it would be a 45min wait for a table. 10min later, a table opened up, but the hostess didn't tell us. We just went and sat ourselves.  I went to tell a server and the hostess we were seated; they said they'll get to us when they can. Perhaps 30min later, the server arrived and took our orders. Drinks showed up 30min afterward, and then food came 45min afteward-- and the food orders were wrong. Some items were missing.  Now, for the food: it was crap. It was horrible, really, considering the location and the hype and the wait. Essentially, the chefs here go for the \"just use tons of fat, sugar, and salt\" style of American cooking.  Overall, it was a terrible experience, from the wait to the service to the food.",

Today we had sandwiches. My mate had the Italian Beef sandwich and LOVED it, with fries which were average. yes he's had Tooties and likes them too. Our friend had the bison burger, and added sauteed mushrooms. He ordered medium rare, which I believe is tough to accomplish in a smaller leaner burger, the guys didn't agree. We both had sweet potato fries with the spicy ketchup, quite delicious. Nice change of pace. I enjoyed the mushroom cheesesteak! Just as it comes- very tasty. At first arrival, I thought the sandwiches may not be that great due to the bread not being grilled or toasted, but they were just right- soft accompaniment to the perfectly prepared flavorful ingredients. The guys enjoyed the  $3 special on Oktoberfest pints, and I'm a fan of root beer so I tried theirs and it was pretty good! Desserts are also good here, I like the decor/ ambiance of the church pews, my favorite is the ladies room :)",

The dip was incredible and not runny and oily like it can be at a lot of places. The lettuce wraps were good and had a lot of flavor but the portion size was dinky to the extreme. Like a tiny little condiment bowl of chicken. The mussels had good flavor but were cooked too long.   I then got the seven onion soup bowl and it was AMAZING and my boyfriend and I shared a pizza-the mushroom and pesto one. The pizza was so good and perfectly cooked.   We each had several beers-mostly Oktoberfest and their IPA. Several so they were obviously worthy of multiples.   Next time I'd really like to check out the outdoor area-it looks really beautiful.",

It's just such a unique place and the food is great, I've never gotten anything there I didn't really really enjoy. I've been here a lot but this one meal sticks out in my mind as the best ever. It was simple, a piece of salmon and mashed potatoes and I think spinach on the side. I also had one of the best desserts ever here, an apple strudel and vanilla ice cream. They really have a way of taking simpler menu items and jazzing them up and making them fantastic. Side note - their pizza rocks.",

This most recent time, it was a debacle to order a takeout order... and when it finally did get taken and we picked it up, much of it was wrong... it was basic stuff that was completely wrong which made it worse.    Consistency is important, and I feel like as of late, there is none here.  I also feel like some of the quality has gone to the wayside.  Hopefully they will step it up and become the place that they once were!",

The Church Brew Works is an amazing establishment. You will just walk around in awe of the structure, the stained glass, and the brewery equipment. Quite a repurposed old church. Have your phone charged because you will likely snap dozens of pictures and selfies throughout the building.  The beers were great. Several craft brews to choose from. A couple of really nice IPAs. They had some stouts and a porter, as well as a few others.  The appetizer that we had was good; pulled pork nachos. But just good, not great.  The sandwiches were just okay. The four of us each had something different. Everyone said the same thing.... it was just okay.  Dessert was not really that good. Tasted like a frozen box cake. No real flavor to it.  So if I were to offer a suggestion, definitely stop by to see the Church Brew Works.  Have a couple of beers, and just have an appetizer or two.",

We then went on to split the shinkasa cheesesteak, and the pulled pork sandwiches.  The steak sandwich was a desert in my mouth, with very little onions and peppers, and no sauce offered.  The pulled pork was ok...but once again, topped with almost no slaw, and very, very skimpy on the sauce.  The final nail in the coffin was the fries.  They were so cold, I couldn't even touch them.  The ambiance is even worse!  Just a dull, loud hum for the entirety of your meal, in a space that seems like they're just jamming you in wherever they can fit you.  I asked if they could turn on some music, and I was told there was music playing.  Whats the points?!  Service was friendly, but inattentive.  This was probably the only thing I could say was decent about the meal, because even though she didn't really check on us very often, she seemed busy, so it's understandable.

I used to live in the Czech Republic and CBW reminded me of some of the old buildings there which had been turned into restaurants and pubs.    Their beers are good. Their hefeweizen and (currently) their coconut stout are exceptional.  Everything else? Sort of underwhelms me. The food is pricey but the quality is sub-par. I've been there several times in the last year, and tried everything from the soups to the sandwiches to the pizza.   Yesterday I had the lobster bisque, some of my friend's thai wings, and a slice of the mushroom pesto pizza. The bisque wasn't worth the $7 I paid for it. The wings were good, but not great. I thought the pizza was salty and rather bland tasting overall.  I've had other pizzas that were better in the past (from the CBW), but again. They aren't anything spectacular.   The service really varies. I've gone there during a weekday and had to wait forever. Other times, the waitstaff was spectacular.   So in a nutshell:  Positives: Good beer, nice environment.   Negatives: Food quality and price.",

    "text": "Church Brew used to be a favorite restaurant. When I lived there it was my default place to take out-of-town visitors.  I try to get there at least once when I visit.  The food? Still fantastic. I got one of my favorite pizzas to go (most of it even made it back home).  The service?  The waiter was awesome.  Perfectly attentive without being overbearing.    So what went wrong?  Simple: They keep the handicapped bathroom locked.  The regular bathroom has steps inside.  This is not good for people who have problems with stairs, or in mobility devices.  So they built a separate handicapped bathroom near the front end of the bar.  When I found it locked -- with no sign on the door other than something saying something like \"Please leave this for our handicapped customers.\" -- I assumed someone was in there.  Handicapped people get used to waiting for the handicapped stall.  Sometimes places install baby changing tables in there, and in a crowded bathroom there's no reason to not use the handicapped stall if nobody disabled is waiting.   Yeah, sometimes jerks use it when it's otherwise empty for stupid reasons, \"I like the extra room\" being one of my all-time favorites.  But usually it's no big deal.  Yet after standing there a few, painful moments, one of the folks at the bar informed me that \"nobody has gone in there\" and \"I think they keep it locked.\"  So I hobbled back to the hostess station and asked for the manager.  Eventually a woman came over and identified herself.   I told her that locking the handicapped bathroom was unacceptable, this is not making this \"accessible.\"  She informed me, in a tone that implied that boxes of rocks have greater intelligence than me, that they keep it locked so that \"only handicapped people can use it\" and that this is done \"for the benefit of the handicapped people!\"  I tried to point out that requiring someone to ask for permission to us the bathroom is not accessibility.  She asked if I needed to use the restroom, and when I said, \"yes, that's the point!\" she told the hostess to unlock the bathroom and stalked away.  Although I walk with a cane, not all disabilities are visible. Do they do a health check?  I can see it now, \"I'm sorry, you don't look disabled, go to the regular bathroom!\"  After spending 10 days fruitlessly trying to find normal, accessible housing in Pittsburgh, so I could move back home, this was the crown on the crap king.   Apartments that advertised \"disability access\" but had steps going to the door had nothing on being told that we disabled people need to be protected from the big bad scary able-bodied people using our place to pee.  Thank you, Church Brew Works, for being the symbol of Pittsburgh, The Most Liveable City For Everyone But The Disabled.",

    "text": "The Church Brew Works has a fantastic atmosphere based on the idea of turning an old Catholic church into a brewery. The venue has a large area to seat its customers for dinner where the congregation previously sat in the church. They also have a bar located in the back left of the establishment.  Unlike our previous trips, we sampled their food menu as well as their beers. While dining, we sampled their Italian Perogies, gumbo, French onion soup, and buffalo steak. Everything was good and had good taste. However, not the best I had through my experiences.  The beer was fantastic. As an IPA lover I sampled the hoppiest beer they had in house and was happy with the brew.  In summary, this is a good microbrew and restaurant in an extremely creative atmosphere. Your dining experience here is more based on novelty than quality, but I'd surely recommend joining the \"congregation\" at this church!",

All of the foods that our server talked about sounded great.  My co-workers ordered the pulled pork sandwich, the bison burger, and the pierogies, which were all met with rave reviews.  I hadn't been feeling all that great, so I wanted something a bit lighter and ordered the roasted beet and goat cheese salad, which was also fantastic.  I wish I could have ordered some of the beer, but I had to go to work a few hours after eating the lunch, and therefore was unable.  Next time I'm in PIT, that's exactly what I'll do though.",

For appetizers, we got the traditional pierogies, untraditional pierogies, and the bruschetta. This was my first time trying pierogies, so maybe I'm just not a pierogie fan, but I thought they were unremarkable. I enjoyed the bruschetta and would get it again.   My table also shared a few pizzas - pepperoni, chicken & sundried tomatoes, and the cinco fromaggio. These are way overpriced for the quality, although they are really large pizzas. I would NOT recommend the cinco fromaggio, unless you're craving a thick layer of salty cheese with an overpowering garlic taste. The chicken & sundried tomato pizza was okay, but I wouldn't pay to eat it again. I liked the pepperoni the best - maybe the simpler pizzas are better here.  Overall, I'd recommend this place - it's a cool place to check out despite the average food. If I were to go back, I'd try their veggie pasta, more of their apps, and the beer sampler.",

And it was totally worth it.    For a business that is founded on an incredibly sacrilegious setup--a brewery in a church--the entire concept is carried out rather tastefully.  The church is highly preserved and still very beautiful.  Yes, you might be sitting on a pew while drinking your beer, but the waitresses aren't walking around in nuns' habits or anything cheesy like that.    They offer a beer sampler that includes all their regular brews and seasonal taps.  There was a nice variety of dark to light beers.  None of them were out-of-this-world amazing, but all of them were quite good.    Only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is the location.  You feel a bit out in the middle of nowhere, which isn't always ideal for a night of drinking.  However, I'd highly recommend this place otherwise.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to visit the Church Brew Works ever since seeing it featured on the Food Network show Outrageous Food. In that episode, they featured the restaurant's \"rattlesnake pierogies\" I was disappointed to find this was not a regular menu item, instead they offer either \"traditional\" or \"untraditional\" pierogies- on the night of our visit the untraditional ones were Bufflale Chicken style, and boy were they good! I still want to try those rattlesnake ones though...  I also had the onion soup and the bison meatloaf which were both delicious, especially the meatloaf. My spouse enjoyed the jambalaya which was nice and spicy. As to the beers, there was a decent selection of styles from lager to dunkel to belgian to stout....and our server accomodated our request to sample some of the brews before deciding. Our favorite of the night was the Thunderhop which had a wonderful hoppy flavor.   As to the ambiance- well I think it is well worth a trip if you are in Pittsburgh. The restaurant is a converted church complete with stained glass windows and wooden pews (ok they are not the most comfortable seats but it adds to the effect!) and where the alter would have been are the giant beer tanks.  We found the service to be very prompt and our server answered all our questions concerning beer and food.  I thought this restaurant was a good value for the money. Dinner for two was just under $70 before tip- and our meal included 4 pints of beer, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.   Visited August 2011",

The stained glass windows are intact and the hop vats (is that what they're called?) are up where the altar once was.  Yeah, there was a bit of sacrilige going on.  But that's fine with me.  I had a business lunch there and had a half southwestern chicken, hold the chipotle aioli, with a balsamic vinagerette salad.  It was tasty though not spectacular.    Service was adequate but not particulary attentive.  I'm giving this a four star mainly because of the ambiance.  I've been in converted church establishments before (London, New York and Salinas CA) but all of those places removed much of the religious iconry.  Not Church Brew and Works.  For those who have an issue with this, I'm glad the place wasn't razed and replaced with condos.  Check this place out.  It's a trip.",

    "text": "Finally, a pilgrimage that makes sense! If church had been like this when I was a kid, I might not have ended up an atheist. Here, the blood of Christ is a luxuriously smooth Porter, his body a crispy-yet-chewy-crusted pizza straight from the oven and his last temptation a S'mores cheesecake with toasted marshmallows. So sidle up to the bar, commit the deadly sin of Gluttony, and do your Hail Marys all from the comfort of your barstool.  This review is an amalgamation of experiences from two visits on consecutive days: 02-27-11 and 02-28-11. The first night I decided to have more bar food type fare. The second I decided to drop my 30 pieces of silver on a few of the fancier items on the menu. I have tried to break up the review into Atmosphere, Beer, and Food ratings, as Church Brew Works seems to fill more than one niche.  The outside of the Church Brew Works remains perhaps unchanged from its original lineage as a church. A tasteful sign with gothic lettering announcing it True purpose is the only hint as to what lies within. The building itself is a gorgeous red brick church with heavy wooden doors.  Stepping through the doorway to the main hall, you're immediately struck by the gorgeous, spacious surroundings. Everything seems as original as possible, from the stained glass windows, to the paint on the weathered walls. The owners seem to have gone to great pains to preserve the condition of the church as much as they possibly could. The bar and much of the seating is made from the original pews; the brass tubes of the pipe organ sit inert and silent on the mezzanine.   Added to the original, traditional accouterment are the latter-day additions: Delicious in their sacrilege, gleaming copper brew tanks occupy the chancel front-and-center, previous home of the altar. Apropos; what better deity for a brewpub? Storage tanks for the final product serry behind the bar; Low half-walls divide the nave into discrete sections without being obtrusive or breaking the flow of the room; a restaurant, like a church, is meant to be a place of gathering, socializing.   As I went during the night time on both visits, I deprived myself of the joy of seeing the refulgency of the stained glass windows lit up by the sun. I can only imagine how gorgeous a dining experience that would have been; light streaming down from backlit iconography onto my food. As it was, I was tantalized by a hint of the possible glory: a rogue streetlight illuminated the face on one of the stained glass windows, perhaps staring at me disapprovingly for drinking in a former house of worship.  As it was, I felt the restaurant was a bit dark. Perhaps the owners could consider installing lights to light the stained glass windows from the outside during the nighttime? Indirect lighting to illuminate the ceiling, especially of the chancel where the brew tanks now sit would give an awe-inspiring sense of vastness to the room. Right now it just seems rather gloomy during the night.  Adtmosphere / Space: An easy five stars out of five. Completely unique surroundings treated respectfully by the renovation. A word of warning: This is not the restaurant to take someone for a quiet, romantic date. This space revels in boisterous celebration and group fun.  As impressive as the space is, we're here to talk about the food, aren't we? Any divine inspiration therein? Deliverance from insipid cuisine? Read on.  I enjoyed two brews at Church Brew Works, polar opposites of one another, and both superb. The Celestial Gold is a very light, hoppy beer. Here in Texas we would refer to it as a 'lawnmower beer'. Effervescent and light on the palette, but with just enough sting from the hops to let you know something is there. Very nice.  The Pepper Porter celebrates the darker forces in the universe. IT is heavy and brooding; decadently smooth with next to no aftertaste, and has very little carbonation, just an ever-so-slight caress of bubbles on the tongue. This porter has replaced Samuel Smith's as my favorite.   Of the limited selections of beer I tried, I felt very happy with them both, and they are in the upper echelon of microbrews I've tried. This is a solid Three-point-seven-five out of Five, but let's round it up to four. If I hadn't been to Portland and immersed myself in the country's finest beer culture, it would have been higher.  Wow I've almost used up my 5000 characters already. Please petition Yelp to allow more.  Pirogi: Excellent, just like great grandmom used to make. Pizza: Chicken and Chorizo. Good but not great. Ice Cream: WONDERFUL malted vanilla with Cinnamon sauce. Some of the best I've had! Buffalo Ribeye: VERY good. The sauteed mushrooms were a highlight.  Overall: I wanted to like the food more than I did. The owners clearly had faith in their space and their beer to bring in the customers, but as we all know, faith without works is dead. A disappointing but still solid three stars out of five. I will go again, but for reasons other than food.",

I greatly enjoyed sitting in a pew and drinking a beer, plus every beer I've tried has been great: the first time I visited I chose a red ale and the second time I tried their winter ale, plus I tried my partner's tripel belgian and our friend's IPA.  On our second visit I ordered a zucchini pasta dish, which was spiraled zucchini with mushroom and lentil falafel-like balls and tomato sauce, it was pretty good, but way too salty and they should seriously cut back on the amount of salt they use in that dish. If I were reviewing just my dish, I would give 3 stars, but since the concept is so cool and the beer is great, 4 is fair. We also ordered pita and hummus and that was delicious.  I'd definitely go back, but I wouldn't order the same meal again.",

I like them all...stouts to wheats to sours to saisons. I'm just never totally impressed when I order a beer here. I will say it's better on tap than in a bottle.   I also think it's overpriced for quality and portion.   All in all will I return to Church? Yes, but I will most like be part of the Easter/Christmas congregation.",

The single best plate of food served to our party of three was an a la carte grilled chicken breast and black bean salad we ordered for our infant. I ordered the seafood pasta. The sauce was flavorless, the shrimp was overcooked and the crab meat was loaded with fragments of shell. The service was similarly bad. Our waiter just didn't seem remotely interested. Pittsburg has many good and interesting restaurants. You don't need to pay ninety dollars for lunch. Almost anything would have been better.",

I am always really into churches, love all these stained glass windows, the stone vaulted ceiling, and the Altar.   Sitting at the benches sampling a beer flight of 8 ($12.75) and eating some Traditional Pierogies ($6.50) was definitely enjoyable experience.

The service was really great, even though it was really busy we were sat quickly, and our waiter was attentive.  I thought the food was pretty good, we got the vegetarian pirogies and a pasta dish that was fresh and tasty.   They're known mostly for their beers that they brew in-house, but it was too early for us to get started drinking. People near us had ordered the beer flight, and from what I could tell it seemed like a great value, so it's still on my list to go back and try next time I'm in Pitty.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a shot, but maybe trying to go at an off hour to avoid the crowds.",

Wide variety of craft beer styles and solid food choices from sandwiches and wood fire pizza to full entree. I had the Celestial Gold beer, an appetizer of pierogis (amazing if your a pierogi fan and I am) and a pulled pork sandwich with a beer based BBQ sauce. The atmosphere is fun. Old stained glass, beer vats among organ pipes. Pews that are used to create the booth seating. A unique place with great food and craft beer!",

All this walking to explore a church\" alas, my fears were assuaged when my party walked into this little slice of heaven and everyone was ohhing and ahhing at its pure beauty. I mean literally, the altar is full of brewing beer! Check out my photos, the floor is still the original and the benches remain as seating options.   Onto the food: hella good. We got the bbq pizza and oh mylanta. Hell yes. So good! And I don't even like bbq pizza!! It came out hot and delicious straight from the oven and it was everything you could ever want out of 'za.  The beer. Unfortunately this is the only reason for that last little star remaining blank...it was ok. Wasn't hop out of my seat and start cheering. BUT the names are all relics of the church life which was pretty sweet.  I'll be back next time I visit for certain!",

We sat there waiting while the people who got there after us enjoyed almost all of their meals. Came to our attention that there is another menu a pub menu with lots of other options. If that wasn't agitating enough when we got our food an hour after ordering it it was lukewarm at most, and easily identifiable that it had been sitting and re warmed in a microwave due to the burning plates and cold food. The waiter, who seemed to be new but wasn't showed no sympathy or empathy and so we got the manager who took off the cheapest items on our bill. Still paid a little over a hundred dollars for 5 people who got cold meals. So if you're in Pittsburgh looking for an expensive meal don't expect to get the expensive-like service here. You might as well warm up a TV dinner at home and save your money.",

We arrived at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon and surprisingly the place was more than half full.  My Uncle ordered a flight and was disappointed that there were no stouts or stout-like beers amongst the offerings.  I ordered a root beer, and guess what, no root (birch) beer.  Wah wah!  My Uncle got a bowl of onion soup and pierogies, my Aunt (I am apologizing as I write this) ordered the Pittsburgh salad, and I ordered the quinoa salad.  I think of the three, my Uncle got the best lunch.  The pierogies are an appetizer but he received a fair number and he said they were v. good, along with the soup.  The Pittsburgh salad was the same as any salad you could get in any bar in Pittsburgh and at $17.50, severely overpriced.  My guinoa salad was a huge disappointment.  Quinoa was a garnish not the star.  The \"mixed greens\" were nearly all iceberg lettuce with a few v. small pieces of spinach.  There were about a teaspoon of corn and a teaspoon of black beans and about 6 grape tomatoes cut in half along with a few pieces of onion.  The \"dressing\" was about 8 dots around the plate.  So the salad was dry.  This was $13.50, again not especially tasty and overpriced.  Next time I will stick to the buffalo meatloaf, which really is quite good.  Service was good, she was capable but nothing spectacular.  Church Brew Works makes good beer, it makes predominantly mediocre, expensive beer with a few stars on the menu.",

I'd heard so many good things about this place and was really excited to try it for the first time. The restaurant itself is beautiful, the old church that it's in is gorgeous. Our server was pleasant enough, but after we were seated there were immediately problems.   The first issue was that the plates that were brought out to us were dirty, like very visibly dirty with dark marks on them. We got new plates brought out to us, but we were really surprised that plates that dirty were given to us in the first place. When the pierogies we ordered were brought out to us, they were all cold and, on top of being cold, they were flavorless.  The manager who came to speak to us didn't seem particularly caring about what happened, he just offered to bring us new pierogies and didn't seem particularly concerned or apologetic about our experience. We just wanted to go at that point and so we paid for our drinks and left without eating. We ended up buying some of the Mrs.T's pierogies from the grocery store and making those at home and they were much much better than the ones we were served at this restaurant. Very very let down overall and I will not be back.",

Everything we got (especially the pierogi of the day, which was avocado, potato, cheese, and chives, I think) was great! The guys enjoyed the beer they drank (I don't drink beer), though they were out of a lot of the beers they tried to order. My Hawaiian mimosa was yummy, but getting my second one took a lot of work. My friend actually went to track her down after it hadn't come in ages and we hadn't seen her. It's a neat restaurant and I'd go back, but apparently their pizza is really great and though it's still on their website, they do NOT have pizza at this time. Their oven burned. Not sure if they're going to have pizza in the future or not.  Also, many of our menus had extra pieces of menus for food that was no longer available that day and we only got 2 of the menus with the sandwiches on them for our entire party (6). Another area where the service lacked in addition to the poor waitress.",

    "text": "So... this was a recommendation to tryout while in Pittsburgh.   The ambiance is awesome. The church is absolutely stunning and huge! It's set up so nicely. I love that they kept different parts of the church but incorporated the brewery in a unique way. I mean I would definitely check it out just for the views.   We were quickly sat and our server was nice. She was relatively helpful to picking things out on the menu.   The food was good but I wouldn't say the best. The kids meals were huge and my kids enjoyed them. My husband loved his food, especially the French onion soup. Mine was good, but came out sort of cold.   The prices weren't bad. There's parking behind the church or on the street. They have a shop within the restaurant where you can purchase different items.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  Not surprisingly, this restaurant and brewery is a pretty bizarre and fun experience! To be honest, I'm actually glad that they managed to preserve the beauty of this structure, versus tearing it down, and to use it for something that continues to bring joy to folks. It sure makes for quite a dining event.   In terms of the overall experience, I can say that it about lived up to my expectations, which were modest but optimistic. They are generally packed with customers, and we were there on a particularly busy weekend night, so just a warning not to expect a speedy evening at this pub. But the wait staff was friendly, helpful, and as prompt as possible considering what they had to work with in terms of clientele volume.   We came for the beer and, unfortunately, I would say that I wasn't a huge fan in that respect. None of them really stood out to me as having that interesting of a flavor. I also tried the mead and was not enamored. They do make some decent mixed drinks, though.   The food was nothing overwhelmingly impressive, but it was surprisingly vegetarian-friendly with some actual effort behind forming the dishes, which is honestly pretty unusual for a pub. I did try the traditional pierogies, which were not the greatest but definitely were tasty and quickly devoured by all. The main attraction for me was the veggie spaghetti, which I gobbled up happily. Usually I would expect to find a meal like this to be not all that filling, but wow did this dish satisfy! I appreciated the variety of vegetables in the dish, and the red pepper pesto was quite flavorful. Ultimately, while this was typical pub food in quality, I appreciated the effort that they put into making unique and flavorful vegetarian dishes, so they get bonus points in my book there.  Overall, this was a fun, unusual dining experience that made for great conversation amongst our large group of hungry, diverse diners. It's a solid place to go with a mixed group when you want a fun, relaxed vibe in a unique environment.",

The atmosphere is in a huge old church in Polish Hill. I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork with fries. I thought the portions were a tad small but that's ok.   The beer I had was their Irish Red. It was excellent. I'd highly recommend it. The other people at my table enjoyed their beer as well. All the drinks looked delicious.   My only slight gripe was we were there for a birthday and brought our own cake. They cut our cake for us but then charged every person in the party $2 for doing so. So, that's $32 for cutting the cake and putting it on a small plate? That's crazy. I think that should be free considering we dropped close to $800 as a group. Oh well.",

    "text": "Gastropub 101 (GP101) - A term I've coined to cover the vast amount of restaurants opening up these days from coast to coast. You know the ones, a hand full of appetizers usually including wings as the main offering, overpriced burgers and sandwiches that you can make much better at home, and dinner offerings that proclaim over the top creativity and deliver forgettable plates of protein and starch with some bagged \"fresh\" vegetable of the day.  Another feature of this new breed of dining experiences is that they look and feel like they're either a chain or want to be a chain imitating the business models of the Cheesecake Factory, PF Changs, TGI Fridays etc. without taking the time to develop an actual good service and food plan upfront. I subscribe to the begin with the end in mind philosophy but you have to create a good product and reputation before you go big. And don't worry, I don't consider the examples stellar places to go but I do frequent them from time to to time because of their slightly elevated level of \"didn't suck\". My best experiences are and have always been the mom and pop's places that now join the ranks of the minority in any food scene theses days. Seek them out, give them credit where credit is due, and keep them alive through your patronage.  As a consumer and Yelper I try to give an honest opinion of my experience so you the potential customer can have enough information to go or not to any particular establishment. So now you know what I mean by GP101 you'll understand upfront that while there may be some variation in the place that is noteworthy the restaurant itself didn't suck, wasn't great, and was forgettable in the end.  I attempt to rate by service, ambiance, and quality of food with a clear understanding that the industry's operational tempo can change from day to day depending on a dynamic set of variables we call the human condition, todays great service might be tomorrows bad service just like all of us have off days so do restaurants. You can bet your bottom dollar that if I start off with the place sucked then it really sucked as I'm usually a kind yelper and look for the good over the bad.  Church Brew works: Service - inconsistent but pleasant Ambiance - Unique and interesting (Only reason for the 3rd star) Food - Forgettable but the beer is good",

Crowded af, but able to find seats at the bar since people sit there until they're called to an actual dining table.   Very spacious and airy, but loud loud loud.  Food: didn't have anything to eat here except beer and the brewmasu. I forget the name of the draft, but it had hints of passion fruit. It was tangy, but overall average.   The brewmasu was really good. Couldn't really taste any beer, but it was light, airy and not too sweet.   Service: worst part of our experience. It was a busy night but they only  had two bartenders.  The minute we sat a bartender asked us what we wanted, but we didn't have a chance to look at the menu so we asked for a minute. Unfortunately she gave us 15-20 minutes and disappeared. A male bartender came by, apologized saying it was busy, but then walked away and didn't come back for another five minutes. I paid for the beers and then we later ordered the dessert. Then when we asked to pay for the dessert he charged us for two beers and the brewmasu. We rectified the situation, but yeah, services was a mess and was severely lacking and it made our stay longer than it needed to be.   Pretty much, come here for the vibe and just to say you've been in a brewery that was once a church. That's what we did and it was an a-okay experience.",

    "text": "Hey there fellow Yelpers!!  If you are in Pittsburgh, this place is just incredible. Let's start with the place itself. The church was built in 1903 and is declared a historic site. Inside, most of the original decor of the church remains. The old church organ pipes remain in the balcony of this historic site and what I like most is the stained glass windows. By the way, most of these historic Catholic Windows site above huge steel drum vats of custom beer.  I haven't decided if this is sac-religious. . The old altar holds several vats of beer and the actual system that creates their brews.  It is amazing. I have pictures to share.   Now, the beer!! I tried a coconut and strawberry brew. Now, this was not some sweet concoction and in fact it wasn't served with a normal tapper and keg system. It was a pump system that was served a little on the room temperature side and it was fantastic. This craft local brew was not sweet, it was dark but not heavy and had a nice nutty aroma to it. I'm no beer connoisseur, but I loved this experience and the fact that it was slightly warm made my beer tasting experience very enjoyable.   The food: We ordered pizza. Now, you might be thinking, really??? Did I mention they have a wood fire oven!!!!???   Yes, they do! And the big thing is this. The pizza is great!! Phenomenal. Unreal!! Out of bounds as Guy would say. Now, we created a cool concoction.  A pepperoni, green peppers, and lamb sausage pizza.  The green peppers were cut thin, which I enjoyed as it was not too much of the peppers and just the right amount. The lamb sausage was incredible. This was one amazing pizza!! Seriously!! You will not find a better pizza. My colleague at work never had pirogies. Really? Dude, you are kidding me? So, we ordered two apps, traditional and Pittsburgh-ized. The non-traditional had a horseradish based inside and were amazing!!  Now, at this point you might be thinking, this review is pretty great, why just 4 stars? Well, dessert was awful!! We each ordered bread pudding which Had a bourbon sauce with it.  The bread was some crappy frozen concoction that was simply awful!! I didn't think the dessert justified dropping this place to a 3 star. I thought that was unfair.   Bread pudding is one of my top 2 desserts.  You have some flexibility with me when it comes to preparing it but this was clearly a crappy joke of a dessert.    Please, please, please make your own from scratch. It isn't that hard and you can do so much better.   Yelpers, despite the dessert disaster, this place is an absolute must see and experience!!! Trust me!! Order the pizza!!!",

Being inside of a Catholic church that isn't a church anymore is kind of trippy.  It's definitely an interesting experience.  As I already mentioned, I loved the food.  Every single member of my party had nothing but fantastic things to say about the food...the service, however, will keep me from ever returning.  Which is a pretty major thing to say, but our waitress was really frustrated she was assigned our table and had no qualms about showing it.  We made reservations in advance so Church Brew Works knew we were coming, we didn't pop up out of nowhere.  Still, it seemed we were ruining a perfectly fine slow Monday for our waitress.  The poor new girl, who was left to deliver our food by herself, was so new to the restaurant that she couldn't identify which dish was which.  At the end, after growing frustrated with any requests we had (which was for a lemon in a glass of water) to not bringing out any water for those who requested it, our waitress threw a tantrum when the leader of our party signed the check but accidentally took the wrong copy with him.  She nastily replied that she couldn't believe he wouldn't leave a tip and harassed a few of those left behind.  At least three members of our party complained to the manager.  It was a series of unfortunate events, but what Church Brew Works accomplished was turning away 17 potential repeat customers.  A few others in my party mentioned they'd had similar experiences where the food was phenomenal but the service was horrendous.   Is Church Brew Works worth a try?  Sure, you won't be disappointed in the food but don't expect polite or even indifferent service.",

Does it get much cooler than that?   Myself and a couple of friends had a few hours to kill last Saturday, so we decided to stop by Church Brew Works. It is, by far, the best way to kill some time or have a delicious sit down meal.   Since we weren't really interested in ordering a meal, we decided just to sit at the bar. Immediately after sitting down, the bar tender handed us drink menus. I'll admit, I'm not the biggest fan of beer. (Sorry beer fans!) So I instead tried on of their February specials: Forbidden Fruit. It was a mix of champagne and pomegranate juice. It was delicious. I also tried the sangria... Best sangria I've ever had in my life! My friends and I decided to order a beer sampler. \"When in Rome...\" Right?! Like I said, I'm not the biggest beer fan, but I'm optimistic about trying new things. The sampler came with 8 beer samples, and the bar tender explained every single one of them to us in detail.   By that point, we were all feeling a little hungry so we decided to order some small appetizers. I ordered the bruschetta. Very, very tasty bruschetta. Maybe they could have chopped the cherry tomatoes a little smaller, but that's my personal preference. We also ordered some pierogis. If you come here, for the love of all things good and holy, ORDER THE PIEROGIS!!!! They were, by far, the best pierogis I've ever had in my life.   Needless to say, but my friends and I left with full stomachs and tastebuds fully satisfied. I can't wait to go back!",

I never saw the church in action, but I assume that it was a beautiful space because it is now. The large cauldrons where the beer is brewed is in the pulpit making for a spectacular scene. The booth-style tables incorporate pews so you feel as if you are at the last supper. Yes, Jesus is in the air.   I ended up getting the Black Bean Hummus and Zucchini Pasta with vegetables. The hummus was very good, but the pita bread was very oily. The pasta dish was beautifully presented and tasty.   I will certainly be back here if only for a drink; but, will end up having dinner as well.   The service was also excellent I failed to mention.",

    "text": "During a weekend trip to Pittsburgh with several beer aficionados, we had to try Church Brew Works! It certainly is a sight to see. The beautiful stained glass windows, high ceilings, seating from the original pews, and brewing equipment featured on the altar all made for a very unique brewery experience. The beer, however, was only OK. None of the beers on the sampling list wowed any of us. My husband did like the Tripel, which was purchased in a snifter-type glass.  We had a few appetizers to compliment our beer. The buffalo cauliflower was seriously delicious - I will be trying to replicate that on my own very soon. The untraditional pierogies made with rattlesnake and cactus and corn salsa were good but nothing special. The rattlesnake was ground and tasted like any ground meat.  The two downsides of the atmosphere were that the tall tables near the bar were very close together and the women's bathroom had a very bad smell, probably resulting from the carpet in the sink area.  As one person in my group said, people come to this restaurant for the experience rather than the beer or food.",

    "text": "My wife and I have really wanted to go to church for awhile now.  Church Brew Works that is!  We even came here earlier in the year but it was so busy that we couldn't find a place to sit so we left and went somewhere else.  This time we lucked out and found a spot at the bar on a late Saturday afternoon.  Unfortunately our seats were at the very corner of the bar next to a cold wall.  The bartender didn't greet us at first but she did give us their drink menu.  We ordered our drinks and a little bit later a few more spots in the middle of the large bar area opened up and we moved and felt a lot more comfortable there.  I felt overall that the bartenders were good too and provided good customer service to us.    It's a really beautiful place in inside.  The atmosphere was great and it really enhanced the drinking and conversation experience with my wife and I.  Which is key in a marriage right?! It was very enjoyable once we got settled in.  We didn't get to try any of their food but we did have an imaginary dinner.  We picked out a few things that we would eat if we would have dined here and when we eventually come back.  It's a good food menu.    My wife loves IPA's and she found a good IPA to drink here. She had their ThunderHop.  They still had their Oktoberfest out so I ordered that for my first drink.  I've had it before in a bottle and I really enjoyed it and it was even better as a draft.  For my second and third drink I ordered their Christmas beer.  In the description it mentions that it was like eating a cookie but it wasn't sweet like that.  I tasted a sample at first and it was a good winter beer taste and not sweet.  We stayed here for a few hours and really enjoyed ourselves.  If you can get here when it's not too busy that's the best time to go.  Like I said the first time that we tried to come here you either had to wait a long time for a table or stand to wait for a bar seat.    So if you want to have a good time at church come to Church Brew Works and you wont be disappointed!  Church Time!",

The tall cathedral ceilings and stained glass are breathtaking. The beer is pretty good too. If you're not a fan of hops though, it may not be for you. Also, They do not carry ciders. I'm hoping they carry 1 or 2 types in the future because it would widen their base.  They used to offer pizzas but this no longer is the case. I wish I could give this Venue 5 stars but the food, although good, could improve.",

It is worth at least one visit, just to see.   However, I'm not impressed by their beer. Their flagship brews are okay, but dull in flavor.  I have visited twice now, and both times, several of their rotating/seasonal brews had run out, leaving me with a limited menu of their flagships or less-preferred rotating taps.  I opted for the Pumpkin Stout and was pleased, but not blown away.  It is incredibly heavy and I only enjoyed about one half of the glass.   I've never tried their food, due to iffy previous yelp reviews.  If you do plan to eat, allot time for seating.  This place does get very crowded during peak dinner hour.",

Come sit in the pews repurposed as booths, pet the meteor, order a beer, and let your taste buds enjoy themselves for a change.

Large serving and tasty, impossible to finish. The Kobe beef cheesesteak was good, but honestly, there have been far better ones for far less.  The meat and cheese board was good, but pricy at $16.95.  The beers were both good...Irish ale and a jalapeno/chocolate infused porter.  All in all, it's good, not great and a bit overpriced.  Some guest taps to add more beer variety would serve them well.  I'll add the obligatory alter photo.",

I would try picnic table approach, maybe simplify the menu with a few items you could rock, and bring in the millineals!  We had two pasta dishes and an appetizer. Not bad, not great. Also the beer was fair in my opinion. There was a coconut porter I think that was good. Didn't make it to the IPA because we were bored and it was a slow Monday night. Love my beer and have had more varieties than I care to mention on here. Probably not good enough to go back too unless I was a first time tourist.  Beer glasses were cool though!",

    "text": "They did a wonderful job melding a brewery into an old church. One can definitely appreciate the intricate architecture thats gone into this place. There is detail in every nook and cranny to catch the eye. The beer is unique in taste and there seems to be a beer for everyone. There are other drinks if you arent a beer drinker and its even kid friendly as well. The food is not the boring norm. The homemade pierogies were delicious and the lamb meatballs with vodka sauce and ricotta are a welcome change to the taste buds. The chicken jambalaya was only slightly spicy but was packed with about a million different flavors. Even if you manage to try everything on the menu,  they have specials which feature unique items like rattlesnake or bison which is definitely not the norm on other restaurant menus.",

    "text": "This restaurant has steadily gone downhill in the past few years, at least by my experiences. It is a go-to spot for inventive vegan and vegetarian options, as well as Pittsburgh salads and sandwiches. However, it seems as though the portions have gone way down and the prices have gone way up. I was appalled to learn that they upcharged $6 for salmon for a salad. I am allergic to their pre-marinated chicken, so I didn't really have a choice. I was expecting a big bowl of greens and a nice portion of salmon, but it was pretty meager. The salad, in the end, was $19.5! For a pub-style salad! I had 2 drinks as well, and my bill, before tip ended up being $35 for just me. That's a bit ridiculous for this style of restaurant.   My friend did enjoy her zucchini noodle \"spaghetti\" with lentil, mushroom meatballs! It was a fun twist on a classic favorite and vegan to boot! However, it wasn't enough to keep us coming back.",

You sit at the bar with a range of in house brew, seasonal for all and a menu to match. Came here specifically for the pierogie special which happens once a year to be alligator. Spicy, unique, delicate. So happy. My favorite part of the process was that I was able to ask them via twitter when this pierogie was being served and received an answer in 30 minutes! so exciting.

    "text": "Every Pittsburgh resident must go to Church Brew Works at least once. My husband and I have also enjoyed taking friends and family members to this unique establishment. At first, I wasn't sure what to think of a pub located within an old church. As a church-goer myself, I felt that I may be breaking some sort of 11th commandment by drinking there. However, I felt much better when I arrived. The restaurant has done an amazing job of maintaining the beauty of the church while creating an all new environment.  I've enjoyed all of the drinks that I've ordered here but particularly like the Cherry Quadzilla. One complaint would be that they always seem to be out of a beer listed on their permanent menu, which is very annoying. Someone in our group always seems to order an elusive beer which leads to frustration when it's unavailable.  Though a little overpriced, I've enjoyed the traditional pierogies ($6.50) and pizzas ($13-15.50). They are descent, but by no means items that I couldn't find somewhere else for less. I have never tried any of the entrees. Entrees range from $15-34, which all seem overpriced. Though the restaurant is cool, I don't think it's fine dining enough to charge more than $15-20 for entrees.  During my last visit in September, our food took nearly an hour to come out. Every second that we waited felt like a minute due to an unhappy baby being with us, but I did think the wait was a bit long for having just ordered appetizers and pizzas. Note to self -- don't dine there on the weekends if you want to be in and out within an hour.  Though I recommend visiting this restaurant at least once, it's excitement and novelty really lies purely within the location. Enjoy this restaurant with visitors, but don't expect it to become your go-to weekend spot.",

My brother got a cold cheesesteak that he described as his least favorite cheesesteak he has ever tasted. The beer is mediocre and tastes metallic to me.

We asked if my Seven Onion soup was coming and it became pretty obvious that she forgot to put our order in. Our dinner finally came almost 45 minutes after we ordered. She never acknowledged what happened or apologized. We had to track down a Manager to explain the situation. While she did remove both of our entrees from our final bill, no one (server or manager) took responsibility for the poor service or said they were sorry. We will not be going back.

It is definitely a prettier setting for a brew house than I am used to.  The waitress we had was really nice and suggested that we go with a sampler since we were trying various beers. This was a great idea and let us sample all the draft beers they serve. I enjoyed all the beer I sampled, some more than others, but they were all tasty.

The church where they've set up shop is in excellent condition, and the huge amount of space inside is all used effectively.  The entire place was packed when we visited on a Saturday night around 8:00. They had a large number of draft selections in an equally large range of styles, all available in taster flight portions. Our server was quick and attentive, the prices were reasonable, and the overall setting was comfortably between calm and lively.  Parking was easy to find just down the street and we found seats at a table near the bar right away.",

    "text": "This brewery is a True Pittsburgh gem. It's always a must to bring guests from out of town to see this place. My favorite beer there is the Pipe Organ Pale Ale. It's hoppy but not too hoppy. The other ones I've had are the seasonal stouts and pumpkin beers which weren't that good. They lacked flavor and body and tasted a little watered down. Stick to the regular beers. Food is a little overpriced but if you do get food, try the pierogis or pizzas. Also be prepared that you may have to ask for the pub menu with the pizza and sandwiches on it. I guess they want you to spend more money on their lunch entrees. Don't be fooled - I learned this the hard way. The pierogi pizza is great. Be sure to go between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday for $3 beers during happy hour. I most recently came here on a Saturday at around 3:00 and it wasn't busy at all but service was still really slow. It's also freezing inside. This isn't a place I frequent often except when guests from out of town are here. I still give it four stars though because a brewery in a church is a brilliant idea and their pierogis are delicious.",

The crust was  thick and chewy--not my favorite pierogie crust.  The fillings weren't great either.  The rattlesnake was similar to chicken in taste and blandness.  The potato was lackluster as well...I've had way better potato pierogies from the grocery store.  My husband tried the beer sampler, and while he found the beers pretty agreeable, I couldn't find a single one that pleased my taste buds.  I normally like wheat and slightly fruity beers, so that could be why...take my beer opinion with a grain of salt.  My entree was the mussels, which were cooked in beer.  Sadly I didn't enjoy those because the beer they were cooked in had a bitter/hoppy taste...meh.  My friend's pizza was pretty tasty, so I think pizza is the way to go for food here.  It was an interesting place to check out while I was in town, but with average food, service and pricing, I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again.",

Beautiful architecture and didn't smell like a frat house-yes, it smelled like beer, but it was very subtle and pleasant. My boyfriend and I shared a bruschetta appetizer, which was alright-it had pesto, tomatoes, cream cheese-but was a little bland. My main course, the buffalo pierogi saute, was fantastic! Creamy, delicious. Not nutritious, of course! But awesome. My friends enjoyed their drinks and my boyfriend sampled a few beers, which were decently sized and everyone could try them!  Unfortunately, the service wasn't the best. We had a server named Andrew, who was pretty decent, but we had to tell him at least 2 of 3 times to get us water, to get other orders. My friend had a coupon for a free pint glass through an app of hers, and we told him at the end of the meal, 20 minutes passed, and I went to get him. He'd completely forgotten. Besides him, this was a wonderful experience and I'd love to come again!",

I wanted a sampler, but stopped myself from getting the 8-beer flight they typically offer and got 4 a la carte sample pours of some of their higher ranked and higher abv brews. To accompany I simply got a cup of the french onion soup, which was really good (and hot, I about burned my tongue and nearly couldn't taste the beer). But, honestly, they could be serving Bud Light (which would be the ultimate sacrilegious experience) and to see what they've done with the place would be worth the $5 Uber ride from downtown Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "If Church Brew Works is declining in quality, I can't see it, and apparently neither can most area diners as this former place of worship was rather bustling yesterday evening.   Megan, our server, was phenomenal, I still couldn't detect any of the \"foul odors\" other reviewers have complained about, and our food, from starter to dessert, was uniformly excellent.   For instance, our duo of appetizers were faultlessly executed. Unable to decide upon The Wild Boar Quesadillas and their Belgian Fries with Lemon Caper Aioli, we opted for both.   The quesadillas included the titular protein along with black beans, scallions, cheddar, and smoked gouda, making for a starchy, acidic, sharp, campfire creamfest within flour tortillas, the rich yet lean meat of the primordial hog permeating the triangles in domineering chunks. Red pepper sour cream and salsa verde colorfully garnished the rip-snorting opening dish while also adding twang and sting.   The Belgian Fries were served in a portion that rivaled that of \"The O\" in terms of size and in twice-fried crispiness, the tart aioli adding a brackish, olive-like decadence Oakland's institution would find a tad too gourmet.   After looking through both the dinner and pub menus, I put my finger on the Buffalo Meatloaf despite it creating some redundancy in my meal with the inclusion of roasted pesto potatoes, but with that sauteed mushroom medley adding savory heft, and the roasted tomato demi-glace playing the role of ketchup brilliantly, I barely minded. Even those cubed spuds themselves climbed out of the doldrums (I never get excited over roasted potatoes) simply by being brushed with that arcane Genovese sauce of crushed garlic, basil, pine nuts, olive oil, and Parmesan. The weight of the steakhouse-worthy dish, however, was successfully carried by the two Stonehengian slabs of coarsely ground Buffalo that were as sweet and Earthy as the grass of the plains yet carried with them a moisture that belied their leanness.   Dessert was a tornado tag-team brawl pitting Kay and I between their Chocolate Mousse Cake and Malted Bread Pudding. Served in halves, the kitchen must have instinctually known of our intention to swap and share. The sublime cakes were mortared (martyred?) by a weightless mousse and were baptized in a ganache that artfully bled down the sides of each, making them into the most elegant lunchbox treats ever realized. Alongside the cakes came amber shards of briny peanut brittle that not only countered the cakes' silken texture with their crunch factor but also complimented their subtlety by bringing the bulk of the sugar.   The bread pudding was a bulky french toast imbibed with beery flavors and topped with chocolate malted ice cream (a collaboration with Dave & Andy's ice cream parlor), turning the dessert into quite the ode to a la mode.   CBW has lost none of its culinary allure. Like rock 'n roll and hip-hop (and of course my beloved heavy metal \\m/ ), it is here to stay.",

Not a healthy meal but it was delicious. We really could have done without the fries but I'm glad we got them and had to take home leftovers.   The real star of the meal at CBW is their kids meal. A grilled chicken breast w a variety of side choices. We chose the black bean salad for the kids meal side. It was gobbled down quickly. I am very pleased that there are options other than fries and apples on the kids meal. Way to go CBW!   Food was excellent, will return again. And again. And again.",

    "text": "I've heard people talk of this place and thought to myself that I must go here one night.  The deal was sealed when my mom had told me she saw on national TV that it's one of the best places to eat in the Burgh.  She was salivating at the thought of a pirogi pizza.  So when my mom came down to cash in on her Mother's Day gift, my sister and I decided to bring her here to eat first.  There was ample parking behind the building so no need to worry about finding a spot on the street.  Walking in, being that this restaurant is located in a old church, you feel as if there is a spiritual awakening about to happen.  And there is one about to happen.  When you enter, make your seating selection wisely.  You can either sit by the bar, or in their 'dining area.'  Depending on what side you sit is the type of menu you are handed.  We chose the dining are and because we were thinking about the pizzas, we had to ask for the bar menu, even if it was just to look.  Also, don't forget to check out the board on your way in to check out the specials and what the untraditional pirogi are for the day.  After looking over the menu, we opted not to have a pizza because we were afraid it wouldn't hold up in the car after we left here.  My mom chose the traditional pirogi with the homemade chips.  Sister decided on Yinzer Cheesesteak with fresh cut fries.  And I couldn't pass up the untraditional pirogi for the day: asparagus and cream cheese.  I also got a side of Belgian fries with lemon caper aioli.  These pirogi were amazing.  I was a bit worried at first when I saw the mixture, but totally surprise by how good the combo worked.  The Belgian fries hit the spot as well, the dip was a nice sweet combo.  My mom loved her traditional perigees and had so much of the chips left over they went home with her.  My sister's Yinzer cheesesteak looked good.  It's just a cheesesteak...Pittsburgh style, i.e. read that as a cheesesteak with fries and cole slaw on it.  The service was top notch here too.  The server knew every answer and was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.  The hostess when we walked in and I asked a question about the untraditional pirogi did not know the answer but told me if I did get them, let her know how they tasted so she could pass it on to other customers.  Everything in here is interesting to look at.  While we waited for our food, we just looked around a lot.  Each of us pointing at various items throughout the building.  Even the bathrooms were nifty.  I, however, cannot speak of the brews.  As I was driving, but I'm sure I will be back to partake in one or more.",

I've been here many times because it's a bit of a cultural phenomenon, but I've never been satisfied.  The beer is decent enough, but in the saturated market of microbrews, pick something else.   The food is okay. I've tried a variety of dishes here, and all fall flat. The perogies (tried many kinds) are okay, still a bit bland. I'm not sure how you mess up a buffalo chicken salad, but they've figured it out. Almost none of the $18+ dishes even come with a salad, you have to purchase them individually for like $5.  Would not recommend.",

Several of my friends were also former alter boys and felt a bit of guilt, just for a minute ;)  From the outside it still maintains the facade of the former church, nothing changed except for a sign of restaurant's name, and even that has been made to fit with the church. When you do enter inside it really has an amazing ambiance. The stained glass has been kept and some of the pews as well. The large brewing casks against the wall and in the back fit well with the cavernous interior.  They had some great choices of their own beer and priced very reasonably considering the microbrew quality. I chose the stout which had chocolate tones with a bit of coconut, and no kidding the first sip I had made me think I was drinking a Mound's candy bar!  They had a choice of choosing from their dining menu or their bar menu. I chose the BBQ chicken slaw melt. It was a a good size chicken breast that was juicy topped with cole slaw, and melted provolone cheese, and bacon :) Yum!  It seemed everyone else enjoyed their meals as well, although the buffalo burger seemed a tad small.  Our server was great. He even brought individual checks for our group of 10.  Although it's not in the most convenient location it is well worth the trip to go out of your way to get here.",

Had a pasta dish with shrimp. It was very good. I think all of us really liked our dishes except for maybe the couscous salad. Didn't try the pizza but some of those looked really good.  We had to wait about 30-45 minutes for a seat but in part because we didn't mind waiting and didn't feel like hovering in the half of the restaurant with open seating. They take reservations for groups of 8 or larger. Prices are a little on the higher end, but so is the food. Main dishes are in the 15-25 range but they are filling and taste great. Good, knowledgeable servers.  My only real complaint, the very poorly marked front entrance. FYI, it is the center door at the front of the church, which seems logical but when you are there, it is not easy to tell.",

    "text": "I saw Church Brew Works on some sort of Buzzfeed-type list which coincided nicely with a visit to Pittsburgh happening a week later, and so I decided to give it a shot.  I figured the chances of me catching fire in a deconsecrated church were much lower than in a regular church, and there was beer. Check and check.  Overall?  Novel, but overrated.  Everything from the exterior of the building and the faux-billboard sign to the bar and brewing equipment in altar/sanctuary area inside the church is a bit of a head trip to see and experience, but once you get past the novelty of it all, the food and beer itself is pretty average.  A colleague I was visiting in Pittsburgh put it best by saying 'it's a place you only visit once, usually with friends from out of town'.    A group of colleagues and I visited Church Brew Works on a Wednesday at 7pm, and the beer wasn't the only thing that was hopping here (it was pretty busy).  We were seated immediately (reservation), however it took us about 20+ minutes to get the first round of drinks after we ordered them.  I don't know what took so long - perhaps he had to climb all the way up to the belfry to fetch them? Regardless, instant strike one. They have about 15 beers to choose from - 25% seasonal and 75% fixed) and you can also order sampler flights of up to 8 beers. I sampled 4 or 5, and really didn't find any of them to be very impressive.  The rotating coffee stout I ordered was pretty boring, although I did enjoy the pale ale.  Unfortunately it took me another 20 minutes to get it after ordering.  Seriously, what's the deal with a brew pub not being on top of drink orders?  Strike two.  I will say that despite the delay, our server was very friendly and helpful.    We ordered food, and I got the bison corn dogs (yum!) and the boar jambalaya (meh).  I've never eaten either meat, and I was happy for the opportunity.  The corn dogs were breaded and cooked perfectly, and came with honey mustard and ketchup condiments.  The jambalaya was not very impressive.  Actually, it was boring. It was more of a rice dish than an actual jambalaya, which was disappointing. My friend really liked the pierogies, and all of the desserts were well-received.  I liked the bread pudding that I sampled off of someone else's plate.   The server split the check 10 ways for us without asking, so that was a nice plus. I found some of the dishes to be a bit overpriced for what they were, but perhaps you're also paying for the novelty of it all? (and maybe the heating bill for a church in late November).  I recommend visiting this place for the novelty, but a place with 'Brew Works' in the name needs to have better beer for me to give it a better review.",

This place was converted from a church to a brewhouse. I'm not sure what denomination it used to be. Inside, they put the vats of beer at the alter and the pews have been replaced by tables and a bar on the side.  We ordered a pitcher of Celestial Gold, a light malty beer and an artichoke, spinach and feta pizza to share. I thought the pizza was all right and the crust was very thin. All I know that they used a very large communion wafer.   This place is a cool to check out if you are in Pittsburgh. I wouldn't mind back here again for the beer, but  will probably stay away from the pizza and try something on else on the menu.",

The Long Island and dragon spirit are both very tasty and the carribean wrap, spinach dip, and shrimp entree are yummy and our service was awesome. Very intriguing place or shall I say brewery in an historic church.",
