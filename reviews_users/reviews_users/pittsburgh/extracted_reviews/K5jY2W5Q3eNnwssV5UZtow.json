    "text": "You don't need to be a hipster to enjoy this dive bar. They kept the old Elk's Lodge sign at the entrance and just rolled with the wood-paneling in the bar area, so they aren't taking themselves too seriously.  I may be a closet hipster, but I arrived to the bar looking like a schoolmarm in my work clothes. The bearded dudes in flannel and the tattooed bartender didn't give me a second glance... they just assumed I'd want a cocktail list instead of a beer list. Once I corrected them, all was smooth sailing from there.  The draft list is short, but quality. They have a beer for every taste. I adored the Hop Farm Provision Saison recommended to me by a friend - has a very subtle hint of flavor that makes for a wonderful aftertaste. It was also $3 draft night, which really can't be beat.  Loved their pizza and love that it can be ordered by the slice. When your favorite pizza topping is anchovies it is difficult to get the haters to allow the salty little gems atop the cheese where they belong, so pizza by the slice becomes a delicacy. The crust reminded me of my beloved Beto's pizza, sturdy and with a soul-satisfying crunch! The sauce was not a dominant flavor, which is another quality that makes me weak in the knees. Quality cheese and salty anchovies slightly melted against that already delectable base and you've got one excellent slice of pizza. I only wished I had ordered more!",

They're cash only - which is annoying, but aside from that, I love this place. I haven't tried the pizza, but evidently it's incredible - so get on that. There's massive amounts of space, I've always thrived most in the downstairs. Occasionally, there will be a professional videographer just capturing your life. PBRs for days (and Ipas/mixed bevs, too). There's a party school bus in the back yard, so beep beep. Ummm, what else - last weekend there was a jellyfish party and it was insanely fun. And next week there's a puppies and pounders party (aka bring your dog). And decor is always themed on point. Ah, perfect!",

The rates are extremely reasonable, especially for what you get. On our brunch day, the staff was friendly and swift. The buffet menu was delicious, and the buffet table stayed well-stocked for the entire length of our party. Our family and friends enjoyed having the upstairs as a private space, and not having to wait in long lines, since we had our own bartenders. I would highly recommend anyone who needs an event space to consider Spirit!",

It's pretty cheap (albeit cash-only), they have stellar pizza with uniquely textured crust and fresh parmesan, and somehow a very cool aesthetic despite being a re-vamped Moose lodge, wood panelling abound. Somebody sure had a vision for this space and executed it quite well.   They have outdoor seating, DJs with taste, and lots of dance floor space. Also, divey vibe without clouds of cigarette smoke! Win!  My only real complaint is they frequently charge a cover even to just grab a drink at the bar and get pizza, which is ridiculous when you're just trying to get out and take advantage of a good neighborhood spot. (When this happens, there's always Gus's or Remedy to take your business)  ...And if only they served pizza for lunch on weekends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

First up, an igloo-looking maze of sorts which was really just a tunnel to get from one of the 2nd floor to the other.  It was in that area that my crew spent most of our evening.  Death metal was playing downstairs, so we opted for the pseudo-electronic DJ and a bevy of delicious \"spirits\" upstairs instead.  My party didn't love the music and I'll admit, if the music was different/better we probably would've enjoyed our visit a little more, but I think we all had a good time just the same. All things considered, I'd return to Spirit, if only for the Fireball-based \"Polowski Mule,\" but it probably won't be at the tip top of my goin' out list.  I'll definitely try their Tuesday draft special - $3 for Pumpking? Sign me up.",

    "text": "heard much hype bout this place via twitter and facebook but couldn't find time to make it over there until recently, when I went for the Sunday brunch buffet . it's in the basement of this former Moose Lodge at the eastern end of Lawrenceville on 51st St aka Stanton Avenue ,around the corner from the Sunoco gas station . there was a hipster-aged guy d.j.-ing old motown & r&b music(might i suggest to him - dude, spin some old bebop-style jazz or boogie woogie piano-style jazz like Errol Garner or even, Louis Jordan?...) on the stage (with blue & purple stage lighting beamed on himself...)  there were flashy \"look how hipster I am\" 20-somethings, suburban? but hipster-aware families and a few old-school o.g. Lawrenceville yinzer types, munching away .       Along the side wall there were a few hot table/steam buffet tables with some vegetarian food(veg food bores me but it did look interesting) followed by some sausages(seemed to be more home made than not) as well as a nice cheddar cheese quiche, salted home fries, home made hummus and at the end, a selection of their pizzas which were in the rectangular sicilian configuration with sausage and various other toppings including hot banana peppers and roasted red peppers... all were good/decent .   there was a \"bottom-less cup of coffee\" for an additional $2 and a bar menu of 3 variations on bloody marys and the usual beer list ... i personally don't like to drink alcohol until much later in the evening so, I opted for the coffee which was brewed well, a tanzanian peaberry, I think it was .   the buffet itself was $13 and I would say, a good deal, given the variety of food to choose from .        The only negatives -  #1 \"cash only\" policy - they direct you to the atm machines at the entrance or back entrance that hit you with a $2.50 service fee that I believe they get a portion of... so, why not just get set up for 'square' or other point-of-sale card machines ?  this would be MUCH more convenient and easy and people are shown to spend MORE when they can throw plastic down...  #2  the d.j. music was WAY too loud for so early in the day as far as i'm concerned, anyway  and the tables were just re-purposed old wooden industrial cable spools... the one I was assigned to was tiny ... like a child's table so I was eating at a very uncomfortable angle/position .. i will have to make a point to get a bigger table OR eat outside on the side deck area, next time .. (was raining hard that day so, moving out there was a not an option...)  worth a try if you're a buffet/brunch aficionado as I am ...  I left with a full/satiated stomach .     salud .",

The atmosphere is a little odd on first glance (it's apparently an old Moose lodge), but the drinks and pizza more than make up for it. The drinks are amazing - ridiculously cheap, fairly strong cocktails made with delicious fresh juice blends. They have a delicious kale margarita that makes you feel healthy while drinking a margarita, which is quite an accomplishment. The pizza, however, might be the best part. Moving here from NYC, I've really been missing good pizza, which I had not found at all until I stumbled upon this place. The crust is perfect, the sauce is perfect, the toppings are fresh and delicious. The guys making the pizza are apparently from Roberta's in Brooklyn, so it makes sense. I definitely plan on becoming a regular!",

I thought the space was pretty cool, but couldn't help but think I walked straight into a Portlandia episode. There were cat heads hanging from the ceiling, party lights, and a DJ who didn't really appear to be doing any DJing. The place was also full of hipsters, like literally every single diner, except for us. I don't have anything against hipsters, it just made me feel really out of place to be around such a high concentration of them all at once. It was probably the most hipsters I've ever seen in one place. Feelings of being out of place aside, we brunched on. The server was really nice and the selection was very unique for a brunch. There was obviously pizza, but there were also a couple unusual salads like a lentil/bean/root salad. The FRENCH TOAST though....that was something out of this world. Some of the best French Toast we've ever had. There was also sausage, which I didn't try because it looked a little overcooked. And then there was quiche and potatoes. They also had itsy bitsy carrot cake and smores bites. The one thing I thought was missing was eggs/bacon. I don't think I've ever been to a brunch without eggs/bacon.",

They only let in a limited number of people at a time so if you have to leave for any reason you are looking at an hour wait to get back inside if not longer. I understand it's a fire code thing but you can't come up with a better solution to manage this? It's funny to me that this place used to be the Lawrenceville Moose Lodge and now we're supposed to treat it like it's some posh exclusive trendy bar on the Sunset Strip. I would recommend drinking literally anywhere else in Lawrenceville.",

After walking in my initial reaction was that it was someone's uncle's rec-room from the 60's or 70's. Definitely had a trendy hipster vibe which is good or bad depending on your personal opinion. They had a good selection of draft beers and pretty unique cocktails. Prices were fine. The majority of the bar tenders were very nice and attentive. One seemed fine but never checked on me since I wasn't an attractive young woman....After the show got a pizza to go and it was phenomenal, they were more than happy to cook it well done as I requested.

A friend and I who are both about 110 pounds each, were bullied and attacked (pulled by our hair to the ground and dragged across the dance floor) by at least 5 or 6 of Spirits angry overly aggressive Big Freedia Concert Patrons each of our attackers had atleast 50 to 100 pounds on us. All a result of 2 of the girls pushing me causing me to accidentally spill my drink on her (something that would typically happens at a packed concert, not that serious) Both my friend and I frequent Spirit quite often and have never seen our attackers there before. After, we were kicked out of the bar with our attackers with no protection. I was so shocked I only thought to call the police after the fact to press chargers. Clearly the demographic of people they're attracting to this bar is changing fast, which happens when you start attracting bigger acts. But the staff should consider what demographics of the acts they book pull out before hosting them- this has a big affect on the bar's environment.  This is not a place I feel safe at all, the bouncers are not trained or equipped to deal with confrontations like this. This was an absolutely terrifying experience, I will never go to this bar again, I will also be telling everyone I know that these sort of situations are accepted in this venue.",

My friends and I were armed and ready to get our morning grub on, but eating off of our old elementary school cafeteria trays in a dimly lit dungeon was not exactly what we were expecting.  The atmosphere was very hipster and has its own charm, but the food was mediocre at best. I went with a party of 5 and no one was impressed with the food. They had typical brunch food like french toast, quiche, and sausage (no bacon, eggs or toast though) but there was also pita with hummus, lentil salad, various desserts, and of course, pizza. I've heard a lot of the hype surrounding their pizza, and it was good but definitely not great. Maybe we can blame that on my unwavering loyalty to Pizza Hut. I will give them credit for being very vegetarian friendly. There were several vegetarian pizza options as well as mushroom gravy for the biscuits, something I usually don't see.   I definitely do not see myself coming back here. Though it's one of the cheaper brunch buffet options ($13 - their website says $11 but that's incorrect), I would rather pay a little extra for better food and actual plates. FYI it is cash only, but there is an ATM there.",

Redone from the former elks lounge it has two stories that offer entertainment and in house pizza back room called Slice Island and an outdoor patio.   Downstairs is kept very dark to give it a grungy vibe. The servers are overzealous charismatic person where you would just wish they would nose the lip ring but amazingly spirited fun people. Let them serve you up a mixed drink or serve a cheap can of beer to your preference and indulge in nightly activities from Sunday's Bingo Bango to Saturday night bands and dancing.   Now be sure to go get pizza. If hipsterism is not your style of dancing in a basement, be sure to at least come around to the back to get a slice of pie from Slice Island, you will not be disappointed. Ignoring the ongoing feud they are currently holding with another Bloomfield spot [not to be named], they serve light tagliare style [cut] on ciabatta bread with a focus on the toppings of veggies or meat. Dabbed spots of mozzarella covered my slice which was amazing, with fresh tomatoes and a sprinkle of mint. Fantastic.    The upstairs part of the lodge will be focused on events and of course more shows and nontraditional events that may not have space in the downstairs space, something to look forward to in the Fall. I hope to catch one of other hungry-hungry-human where you are on skateboard and utilize laundry baskets. [hellz yea]  Make sure to make this is a spot on your list when coming down Lawrenceville it definitely does not disappoint.",

    "text": "The first time I went to Spirit was to check out my friend's band, Shaky Shrines, on their opening night. It was insane. There were so many people and the place was packed. We waited almost and hour to get in (to be fair, there were about 20 of us that were together). It was not a great experience. Since then, i have gone back many times and I have to admit that my opinion has changed considerably.   To start with, the drinks are great. When I go at night, I generally stick to my usual whiskey and water but every once and a while a good cocktail is a great treat. Spirit plays on traditional cocktails but with a unique spin. They use fresh juices and shrubs to create thoughtful drinks that are refreshing (and keep you feeling guilt free). One of my favorites is the kale margarita!  Next, I should move on to their pizza. Oh my! It is tasty. This crusted, square pizza covered in cheese. A very pleasant surprise. I hear their specialty pies are really good but I stuck with a slice of traditional pepperoni. It was a little pricey (just over $3) but was a large piece sliced in two.  What I really love about Spirit is its existence as a music venue. I know that it has taken the arduous task of hosting 80's night while Belvedere's is closed for renovation but they have served as a location for much more than 80's night. I recently went their for Bike Fest 2015 to see Grand Piano and it was great. The weekend before I was there to see Wooly Woman and Dream Phone. It also was a host of RANT. It really makes me giddy to know that places such as Spirit, Cativo and Bayardstown are starting to really offer a home for local bands. There are many places i know that host shows (Howler's and weather permitting shows are also great) but I have really enjoyed how spacious Spirit is. I'm certainly not knocking any other location. I'm just really happy about the addition.  All in all, it is a great place that offers indoor and outdoor spaces, with great food and great music.",

    "text": "This place has been open for a weeks.  We randomly stumbled upon it after our post dinner (pusadee's garden) walk.  We were feeling adventurous and thirsty and decided to wander in.  It's an old Moose Lodge- which makes for some interesting furnishings and a disco ball in the middle of the room- it's got a very charming dive/lodge feel.  Through the kitchen and in the back of the Lodge is a place to chill, play horseshoes or others enjoy your beverages outdoors.  The crowd was a mixed bag- but the average age seemed 20 something.  We were definitely on the oldest folks in the bar.   The drinks are great- no crazy tender bar concoctions but fresh juices for mixers and plenty of beer on draft.   My favorite drink of the evening was gin and juice-included gin, carrot juice, ginger.  I also got the Laura Palmer - a fabulous bourbon drink!  They have baby Budwiser cans for $1.   On Sunday nights (we were there on a Sunday evening) they play Bingo (aka Bingo Bango) for a chance to win pizza or a drink.  It's a silly, fun way to kill some time.  We won and got a piece of pizza (yes, I know we already ate dinner thank you.) and it was yummilicious!  They end Bingo Bango before 9 because they show Game of Thrones.  It seems like it's a mixed bag as to whether folks want to watch or not.  Seems like the staff isn't so much on GoT.  The reason I mention this is that if you come here to watch it can be annoying with all of the other convos from folks not into it.  But no big for us.   The staff is young and friendly.  The only opportunity for improvement is that the one bartender forgot our order 2 times- so we had to remind her.  I heard her apologize to other folks for forgetting- might have just been a 'one of those days.'  She was super responsive after we reminded her.   We DEFINITELY will be back and will bring some friends (cool ones) from the suburbs.",

There is a decent variety of drinks and cocktails to tickle your fancy and pickle back shots for $5 a pop. Not a bad deal and virtually a guaranteed good time. The outdoor area in the back calls for some super chill vibes but management is nice and keeps it down for the neighbors; No music after dark it seems.  The pizza here is woo-worthy. Perfect drunk menu to grab everything your drunken heart desires. Fried cheese, fresh pizza, fresh toppings. It really is just a match made in heaven for anyone who likes to drink, have a conversation and perhaps grab a bite to eat.  Two things that suck:  The cover charge every time you go. The talent performing seven times out of ten.  I know that is hypocritical to say based on the way I started this review, but Spirit isn't a ton of fun every time because the music is THAT bad. The fact that you have to pay to find out if it is bad or not adds insult to injury. We often send in a recon friend to see if it is any good at all before everyone pays $5 for a headache. I have definitely gone and enjoyed the music there big-time though, hence the 4-star rating.   Personally, I enjoy it and really wish they would bring back the roller-skate night they had once a month when belvedere's burned down, because I enjoyed it around about 1 billion times more at Spirit where the air wasn't toxic.",

I Got there at 2.45pm on a Sunday, and they don't start serving pizza until 3pm so NBD, we just hung out and got a drink. When 3 came and I tried to order 2 slices at the bar, the bartender said \"so 2 vegan slices w pepperoni?\" And I said \"Do you only have vegan? I'd rather have regular\" And she goes \"We only have vegan pizza... we make our own vegan cheese. it's really good. The pepperoni is meat tho.\" I thought ok, that makes no sense, but I'm down to try new things. Sure why not. I SHIT YOU NOT, THAT CONVERSATION HAPPENED. My friend was there and heard the entire thing go down. Well, I realized after looking at the menu & talking to people actually eating the pizza that they have regular non-vegan pizza, and after asking a different bartender- who was a hairy condescending dick btw- that they ONLY have regular pizza, NO VEGAN PIZZA AT ALL. Seriously WTF....?  I finally got some regular pizza and it was actually pretty awesome. Now that I know the deal I guess I'd go back again.... but what a shitshow.",

Some of the best pizza in the city (in my opinion), great dance nights and a friendly, knowledgable bar staff.  The monthly art installations are always interesting, and the events they have upstairs are great. Not many bars are able to pull off the style they have without being over priced and a bit cliche. Spirit is neither. I always run into a friendly face and have a great time when I'm there.  Recently started going to their brunch buffet, and that too is wonderful. Lots of vegetarian options, great price ($11), and there's always been a dj as well which I think is fairly novel for brunch.  Highly recommended- definitely worth following on Facebook for the event updates. Can't wait to make it to $10 lasagna night! (Which apparently includes a salad and a glass of wine )",

This band was the first of two opening bands which is almost beside the point because our conversation is NONE OF HIS BUSINESS. I'm sorry we tipped him on the first round, he needs to get over his impossibly hipster self.  I will make sure to spread the word as a local, and a previously frequent visitor.",

They have a downstairs and upstairs area so there is plenty going on in regards to their night scene. They serve pizza all night in the back corner of the downstairs level and it hit the spot.

If you like any of the following, Spirit is the bar for you:  having fun, drank, bingo, trivia, cookouts, party bus, video games, gallery shows, non-profit  and community fundraisers, dancing, ample parking, sexy bartenders, BRUNCH BUFFETS, hipsters, punks, parents, squares, really old people?, bad boys, prank kweens, dirty birds, mozzarella, more fun.  In the short time that Spirit has been open, they've managed to do more innovative, fun, creative, and community driven events than any other bar or venue in recent memory. You can find me there a few times a week, whether it's for a dance party that has me taking my shoes off and shaking it *so good*, a happy hour catch-up cocktail with an old friend, a pizza party, or a lingering lazy hungover brunch.   Sometimes I will be on my way to a new event at Spirit and I'll have a moment of pause, thinking to myself, \"is this the night that Spirit has jumped the shark?\" But by the end, you realize that Spirit has just jumped onto the back of the shark, and is surfing along with it, pizza in one hand, party in the other",

    "text": "An important addition to PGH night life... not to mention a local pizza revelation!   BAR: The vibe downstairs is that of a relaxed social club, with good beer on tap, great cocktails, and affordable cans too. You don't have to spend a crazy amount of money to have a good time here. It's cool and approachable and hip for sure, but certainly not ultra-chic or pretentious. In fact, quite the opposite: Warm, fun, and anything-within-reason-goes. A mixed crowd tends to hang downstairs, including trendy 20 & 30-somethings, punks, and locals of all ages. The bar tenders are super nice and the staff is usually in a good, playful mood.  PIZZA: The pizza being made at their Slide Island pizza counter in the back of the building is nothing short of amazing. It's a more complex, higher-end pie than you're gonna find in Lawrenceville or Bloomfield. Square-cut, expertly prepared dough with a whole bunch of locally sourced meat and veg topping options. I always get two (or more) slices when I'm hanging out, but they also do take out... and there's no reason not to just pick-up a pie from here before a quiet night at home. It's a hell of a lot better than Vocelli's or Domino's, and still quite a bit better than the local chains too.   EVENTS: It's necessary to mention that the events here are some of the most fun, zany things being done in the city right now. DJ nights that run the gamut between techno, post-punk and new wave, early-90s all-female R&B, and more. Special events with amazing light shows (they were even covered in the Huffington Post in October 2015), tasty revisionist fish fry fundraisers, movie screenings, 90s-themed nights with tons of Sega and Nintendo games, pig roasts, brick oven pizza cook-off competitions, and even dance parties on schoolbuses outback. Really, no one else in PGH can touch the sheer ambition of what the Spirit crew is attempting here. Plus, lots national touring acts and great local indie performers.  This place is definitely happening now... don't miss out!",

Downstairs has a nice little staging area in the corner with tables distributed throughout the center and a bar along the longest wall. If you walk through the kitchen, there is additional seating outside that also leads to a really cool decorative school bus! I got a slice of pepperoni slice which is really two rectangular pieces of pizza (rather filling). Beware that the pizza sauce has a kick to it! As a person that likes things spicy, I enjoyed the pizza very much. However, my friend who doesn't like spicy food was coughing after the first bite (lol). Hopefully, this is helpful as to whether you should try the pizza based on the spice factor. Upstairs there was much more room than imagined. Lots of record vendors spread amongst the area with a larger stage (the DJ was here) and another bar in the back. I paid $7 for a plastic cup of Pinot Noir which was room temperature; it would've been nice if it was slightly chilled. I'm excited to attend another event here whether it be the Record Fest or something else creative.",

I'm guessing this mostly refers to its appearance as a nondescript, closed looking former Moose Lodge with really good drinks (hence the fine logic).  To look dim and divey, and then serve cocktails with mint lemonade and arugula pizza is an example of what Pittsburgh should be going for.  Long bar, cozy round booths, and a dark dance floor makes it for me. Bingo and Game of Thrones on Sundays, the early In Bed By Ten party on Fridays, and \"Slice Island\" pizza (!) .. I'm really excited about Spirit Lodge.  The staff was super surprisingly friendly and quick when I expected at least a little snoot, especially on a busy 80s night temporarily being hosted for Belvedere's.   Check the event calendar on their site, I guarantee there is something this week that you would be into.  Just don't be put off by the dark facade and hoard of youths blocking the entrance (nonsmoking establishment, you'll have that). Get a rum swizzle, a pizza, and enjoy some Oingo Boingo on your Thursday evening.",

    "text": "So I have been here twice now and my opinion about it is totally divided.    The location is cool, big and divey.  There is outdoor seating and a really impressive garden In back.  There is also lots of parking.  The first time we went it was a Sunday and we played Bingo Bango, which is just bingo for Pittsburghers.  The pizza was excellent I got a margarita slice and a veggie slice which was a delicious combo of kale and lemon.  They also have a meat option.  On the second visit I got a cocktail which was really good, gin and juice made with real juice,  I think it was Apple, cucumber, ginger and carrot.  I would like to try there other cocktails at some other point.    This week the pizza options were different, as they change on a weekly basis, but they still have three, margarita, meat or veggie.  The veggie this week was broccoli, and yes they used fresh broccoli, moz, cheddar, breadcrumbs and ranch.  The ranch was house made and looked like something I would make at home, which  I appreciated!  They do make it in house, I asked.  However this combo is not something I would ever choose if I have the option for other veggie varieties.    There was not much broccoli on it, and the pieces were really small.  It was fine though I didn't hate it I just think it was kind of a bizarre combo and like the kale and lemon a lot better!    When we went up to order another piece I wanted to give them my feedback, but the person who was assisting us seemed to not care about what I was saying and did not seem interested in hearing it.  I was not being rude I just like to give feedback at restaurants sometimes.    I also wanted to ask about the pizza buffet they have during the week and what that is like. He didn't really seem to want to answer me, brushed me off by saying it just has two types of pizza on it ( which doesn't sound like a buffet to me).  The second slice we got took forever!  I kept on checking back for it until finally asking where is was after 40 mins ( we were hanging and drinking so it didn't feel like that much time) turns out he took it off the counter and put it above the oven...why did he do that?  Was it just to be rude? Not sure...Obviously that slice was terrible and we were not happy about it, but because we were with friends I didn't make a big deal of it.   Moral of the story is I am not intimidated by hipsters, but I don't have time for rude or pretentious ones.    I would give Spirit another shot and maybe adjust my rating.  But for now it seems like they had a great start but that has not been sustained.",

My first impression was that this place was going to be a gallery - but to my surprise it is  indeed a funny little dive bar that does it all - art on the walls, a projector that shows movies and the all important GOT on Sunday nights, plus their better than most bar and food selection. The interior is definitely a lodge-y feel with wood panel walls and quaint Christmas lights hanging as if you were hanging out in your parents basement.  The bartenders are friendly and timely. Since there isn't too much of a crowd, the bar staff has time to experiment and try some new mixology, ready to try a new combination as requested.  There was also more food than I expected.

Libations and delicious food aside, the atmosphere is great here. I have lived in a few different cities, and I have never been to a place with a crowd as consistently diverse as the one here (especially at the Bed By 10 dance parties)! This is a spot where absolutely anyone can come and just have a good time. I really love that.  I feel like I would be doing a disservice if I didn't mention one more time how phenomenal the pizza is. Our regular order is the white pizza with pork sausage, it is incredible and I don't think I will ever get tired of it.

    "text": "if you want to eat grossly overpriced scraps of terribly conceived / horribly executed food in the musty basement of a hipster social club, you've found the right spot.  an hour into brunch service, 3/4 of the \"buffet\" was empty. dirty cafeteria trays were provided for us to pick through the scrapings of whatever stuck to the bottom of empty pans while we waited for the kitchen staff to debate whether or not they felt like working the other 4 hours of their shift and refill any of it... because, you know, life is hard and #whoworksonsundays?  a salad of unseasoned elbow macaroni, old greens, and oil was a great start. the stale \"garlic bread\" resembled used pizza crust pulled from the trash can, a great compliment to the flavorless hummus that had a grainy texture you'd find while wiping the day after eating an entire container of peanuts. the pizza options, all of which appeared to have been cooked under their respective heat lamps for the last 18 hours, were all tainted by an overwhelmingly foul taste of olives. biscuits and gravy? non existent, unless I wanted to combine crumbs and the cold crusted edge of gravy overflow onto the steam table. french toast sticks? nah, but I could have eaten spoonfuls of crumbs and cinnamon sugar. bacon? nope, but I could have soaked up the fat in the pan with a napkin and sucked on it for satisfaction. crispy potatoes! those were average. great way to supplement the default ketchup diet that was about to be embarked on. zucchini fritters.. my god. fried in oil that clearly hadn't been changed since the first hipsters invaded lawrenceville, these pucks of stiff, oily, filth would not only suck all of the moisture out of your body, but may continue on to take your soul if you don't stop to take a drink of Flint's finest imported tap water (complimentary to the table!).   wait, a new pan of food! my curiosity runs wild... quiche! I really could have gone for some quiche. the guy in front of me scoops out a rectangle of something that resembles a stiff custard, the outer crust giving up and falling away like a dry scab. I'm there and haven't had anything that resembles a meal, so I take it. it jiggles like a jar of warm vaseline and has a gummy brown filth on top. still no bacon as a life preserver. a few biscuits have appeared and a half full pan of gravy... take two biscuits, scoop gravy from the depths. sausage and sage? ok, could be safe. I sit and try the biscuits... cold, doughy, smothered in a flour heavy lava with crumbs of what could be sausage. I'd prefer an MRE. move to the \"quiche\". what in the mother f***... a closer look reveals a look of gelatinous tofu, tastes nothing of eggs, cream, herbs, or anything else that a quiche is made from. pure unadulterated filth. i want to throw up but i couldn't lose the precious calories from potatoes and ketchup. I quit. the coffee is as terrible as expected.   $15 for that experience. unreal what people consider to be respectable food and atmosphere. please close your kitchen, and may god have mercy on your souls.",

For $10, you get a small salad, a more than generous offering of Lasagna and a glass of Chianti.  This night was calling my name.  We arrive at 5:30 (good thing, lasagna ran out at 7:30) and sat at the bar.  There were tables with red gingham table cloths, really old world.  The bartender was friendly and service was great.  Right when any dish was dirty, BAM, it was gone.  The food was prompt and just enough.  Then, as were were eating our lasagna, we hear the harmonic tunes of Frank Sinatra!!  What an added bonus.  Spirit had a Frank Sinatra impersonator which was the icing on the cake.  It was A-MAZING.  People were dancing, he sang directly to me, it was dreamy.  I was told that Frank might not be there each week. This was the first night of $10 Lasagna and it seemed like a hit.  I am not sure that without Frank, that this night would have been as exciting.    I am nervous to go back to Spirit because I am not sure that they can top Lasagna night.  But I will sure try.",

I just want to say that Spirit is rad as hell and it doesn't matter who you are.  The bartenders are cool; the beer list is worthwhile, the cocktails are cheap. The food menu is a gem; the pizza crust is always crispy, the grilled cheese and tomato soup hits the spot. The downstairs has music and installations. The upstairs has weirdo events.  The crowd that this place pulls is eclectic. From well-dressed yuppies to hipsters to older Yinzers to the random wanderers, everyone is always smiling and having a good time. The dance floor doesn't always fill up, but if you want to dance, then dance!  This place is so accepting of all types of people from all types of backgrounds with all types of interests, and their diverse list of events only furthers that mentality. They don't judge, so why would you?",

We have been heading to Spirit Lodge for a local PA wrestling event that they hold in their upstairs venue space about once a month.  There is typically a cover charge for the events but you can visit the downstairs bar and order food for no cover.  The upstairs venue space is huge and also has a small bar. The drinks are cheap ($3 PBR pounders and $4 Jack Cider cans), the staff is nice and it is cleaner than most dive bars in Lawrenceville.  For events they will serve pizza by the slice for $3 for plain and $4 for pepperoni-I totally dig square pizza. Downstairs you can order entire pies that are reasonably priced. The pies do take a while to bake as they make their own dough but worth the wait.",

The artists they have here are usually incredibly unique, and sometimes they're good, too. I never had the pizza but I hear it's decent.  The big thing about this place is the parties. They're worth the high entry cost. Just make sure you always try to buy a ticket before you go if you plan on getting in. They can sell out.  What I think is 5-star worthy about this place is that it is not only completely unique, it creates a new vibe, does it well, and there is really nothing else like it that I have ever seen. It's like Tequila Cowboy for hipsters. I think Spirit is one of the only places in Pittsburgh that I would tell someone to come from NYC or LA and make sure they saw it.",

If you've ever had breakfast at a hotel, you know that sometimes breakfast buffets can be boring and disappointing. Everything here was great!!!!   They had a variety of food--- from salad to quiche to pizza. I had to struggle to control myself so I could try a little bit of everything. The quiche that they had might be the best quiche I've ever had! I don't know how they keep the eggs so fluffy and moist, but oh-my-god-yes. Biscuits, mushroom gravy, chickpea salad, french toast sticks-- had a few bites of everything. YUM!  They also had some vintage clothing and accessories for sale, as well as some records and comics.

Gross, failing nursing home buffet style. Dingy, Shawshank Prison buffet style. The Baltimore of buffets, a crime scene. Grade school French toast sticks, burnt half dollar sized sausage patties and a quiche that made me wish I had lost all five of my senses were the highlights. I think the granola was just cocktail nuts taken from the bar and coated in corn syrup. All self served into a plastic divided cafeteria tray and eaten with silverware salvaged from a Monongahela shipwreck. I would gladly have paid $13 to have the cook throw the food into a dumpster.   My drink was also gross. A michelada in name only. Watery, thinned out tomato juice and other suspect ingredients thrown into an 8oz glass served lukewarm. A glass of V8 with a Coors Light dumped into it would have been better by miles. They should call their version a Michenada, as in nada lot of flavor, nada lot of effort put into it and nada lot of pleasure forcing it down my throat.   Brunch is over. It's dead. And Spirit Lodge killed it. Don't go here for brunch. Don't go to brunch. Stay home and make your own noon on a Sunday breakfast. Also, it was hot as balls in that basement. Get a goddamn air conditioner!   Truth!",

Last time I got a chard margarita and this time I got a tomatillo margarita and a few hot ciders. It's always a pleasant surprise to see what's on the menu for both food and drinks. Drinks can be a little pricey, which is the only drawback for me.  One of the coolest things about Spirit is the atmosphere. It's always super strange in a positive way and you really never know what to expect. Bingo bango is definitely not family appropriate, but it's a fun activity for friends or maybe even a date that doesn't mind something out of the ordinary!",

The Bloody Mary bar at brunch is really brilliant. Just recently they had a light installation in display from a local artist (The Vault) that I wish could be there permanently.

Then you realize that the disco ball is spinning and the DJ is blasting some jams while a 3 year old takes it away on the dance floor. You have some biscuits with gravy or berry compote, quiche, fresh grapefruit slices, salad decorated with mandolined radishes, exquisite pizza, and perfect $3 cold-brew coffee (or included free bottomless drip!). You leave happy.  UPDATE: Tried brunch out on the patio (I was a fool before for not realizing its glory!), and it was fabulous as expected. Going to keep coming back to this gem.",

The pizza is some of the worst pizza I've ever eaten. And I taught elementary school after Michelle Obama's dietary school lunch changes. One piece is halfway flexible and then stiff like hard like a brick. The other completely hard like a brick. It's inedible. Absolutely disgusting. I mean to the point that my dogs wouldn't eat it. And those two eat everything. Please see my other reviews!  The crust is so hard on the one piece that the dogs are using it to drag it around the house and play with it by flipping it in the air and chasing it around. That doesn't seem right! It's really really hard and the toppings don't fall off.",

We ordered the square cut pizza pie since the reviews were high and the picture of it looked so yummy. What a disappointment at the first bite and it was not anything like the picture. Very little sauce, which was only a tomato sauce, and pepperoni that was sparse. The pepperoni had to be the cheapest brand because it was tasteless. The only thing decent was the crust. The price was $18 for a 12 cut and with pepperoni the bill came to $24 dollars. A little more than that $ average dollar. If the pizza is their best, I can imagine what the rest of their menu would be like.",

    "text": "I finally got to brunch a month ago on a Saturday with my sister.  Brunch is served in the basement of what was originally a fraternal lodge.  If you're looking for a place that's well lit with new everything, this is not the place.  It's still got the furnishings/layout/vibe from the former lodge, and that was OK with me. The brunch was fantastic.  Lots of things to choose from, including their famous pizza.  I actually skipped the pizza (another time!) and dug into the more traditional brunch foods: little mini biscuits with mushroom gravy (the sausage gravy was also excellent), a lovely salad w/ mixed greens, radishes, and shredded chicken breast in a light dressing, quiche, French toast, greek yoghurt with fresh fruit and homemade granola. A free, bottomless cup of coffee is included with brunch.  I also opted for a lemonade, served in a large glass and was subtly sweet with a sweet syrup that may have been infused with lavender.  My sister had an old school bloody mary, served in the same behemoth kind of glass, which she said was excellent. The place was maybe half full and we were waited on by the bartender, who did a great job checking on us, bringing refills, etc. For $15, I thought it was a very good value, since everything was freshly made and made with high quality ingredients.  My lemonade was $3 (which I thought was very fair) and my sister's bloody mary was, I think, $7 or $8, again, considering the size, a reasonable price. I'd highly recommend the brunch and am looking forward to returning.",

Once inside, the feeling stayed, and I felt at home right away.   At the bar I ordered a draught of \"Fighting Elleck\" Cider, locally brewed at nearby Arsenal Cider Works.  The function provided various styes of square pizzas, from plain red sauce and cheese to pepperoni, and even a white pizza with mushrooms, and a spicy Sicilian style with red peppers, all the pizzas I tasted were glorious!    After our function ended, there was a band coming in to set up, so I suppose they provide live entertainment here also.   I'll have to look into that for the next time I come back . . . this place is really cool . . . Spirit Lodge . . . Awesome!!!!  P.S.  I forgot to mention the artwork on the walls . . . lots of it, and very cool stuff.  I even saw a painting of my friend on the wall, who is recovering from breast cancer, so that was something I never expected . . . so yeah, cool art too . . . !!!",

The general look hasn't changed too much but they have added some nice elements, such as the bar upstairs, string lights and, most recently, some new seating upstairs.

My boyfriend and I purchased a \"Just Pay Half\" deal: $12.50 for $25 toward food and drink purchases, so we decided to stop by for a pizza Friday evening around 8:00. When we walked in, music was blaring (my fault for not realizing it is \"clubish\" before coming). There was a $10 cover fee to go upstairs, so we just decided to go downstairs to get our pizza. The ambiance was dark and creepy... similar to what I'd imagine living in an Edgar Allen Poe poem would be like.   We decided to order a pepperoni pizza; $25 for a pizza is insane in my book! We also ordered drinks and to say the bartender was unpleasant is being polite. This bartender was MISERABLE. She was rude, especially when I asked if I could order my pizza at the bar. Then she proceeded to have an attitude while she asked for our drink order.   The pizza was mediocre in my opinion. It tasted like a pizza I could make at home. I thought the pizza would be Spirit's saving grace, but it was definitely not. Edible? Yes. $25 deliciousness? NO.   When we were done, I asked to use my Just Pay Half deal on the check. All of the employee were unsure of how to use it... they apologized because they \"only get one like every two months.\" They then proceeded to ask me if I could scan it on my phone? I was so confused by this.   100% would never come back to Spirit... at least now I know?!",

First time, I visited on a Saturday night when there was no special event going on so there was no cover charge and we were able to get a table. Not sure if we were there too early that night, but there was barely anyone there. Service and pizza were great. We ordered a few of their \"LTD\" pizzas and they were really good. Thin crust and great flavor. My second visit was during a special event so there was a cover charge to get in. However! If you want take-out pizza, you can call to place your order and just go around back to pick up. We ordered a different LTD pizza this time and was still delicious after the 30 min drive home.

They told a group they would pay them 10% of bar sales, then, only after the show, told them they weren't paying them A DIME. NOTHING! You'll get excuses instead and walk out with zero cash. I guess bartender Katie needed it more than the band they screwed over.",

    "text": "Review is for Sunday brunch.  A college buddy brought me here within 1 hour of landing for their brunch buffet and bottomless cups of coffee. Who doesn't like bottomless anything (except wells when you fall in them, but I avoid those things).  Things I liked:  1. Ambiance. It was a cool basement space, I enjoyed the music and DJ, and the use of.school lunch trays really rocked.   2. Coffee. I wish I wrote.down the roaster. It was good coffee and they offer almond milk for no extra charge. I swooned at that.  3. Buffet options. Salads, breakfast food and pizza... they cover vegan/vegetarian with some limits, but overall good mix of selection. Even a vegan pizza option.   4. Service. They were great, I never needed to ask for a refill on coffee or water and plates just vanished without wondering whether you should self bus your table.  The \"meh\" stuff: I just want that into the food. It was great variety, but there wasn't one thing that i would, sat, dream about having again.   All in all, decent experience, but as a traveler who comes in regularly for work, I wont likely make this brunch buffet a habit, without the WOW, there are just too many other brunch options to explore.",

The staff are super nice & the pizza is awesome. Plus drinks are cheap & they even have happy hour. We had a company happy hour here on a Friday & they created a special cocktail just for us. Our server was awesome & on top of things doing separate checks for like 16 people. They do have live music too. But earlier in the evening people even stopped in with kids. In summer there is a back patio. I parked in a lot to the right of the building & because it's off the slower end of Butler St you can still find free street parking as well, which is handy.",

    "text": "Love me some slice island. These guys are always slinging pie until the wee hours of the nights (Thursday through Saturday until 1 AM). The pizza and cheese is made in-house daily, quality ingredients for sure! Fresh focaccia bread baked with unbleached flour. Plus, they pull their own mozzarella and curdle their own ricotta. They always have a vegan option as well, which includes their house-made red sauce seasoned with fresh herbs. Topping are a bit pricey, especially for a whole pie, but I love how they saute and season the veggies first to give some added flavor. Their salads and garlic knots are also delicious and everything is super fresh. Evident by the crowds of people you'll find in the kitchen night after night. Great pizza and tons of variety, worth the try if you haven't had it yet!",

    "text": "Brunch = AMAZE.  To be quite honest, I had been given poor information that Spirit was a \"weird place\" by someone who visited once during an interpretive dance night, ASSUMING all nights at Spirit were strange. They were very wrong. While I have not been at night, I can say that brunch is AWESOME. There is a buffet set up in the main room for you to serve yourself as much deliciousness as you would like, with the option to order drinks as well. For the price, I was pleasantly surprised at the selection. There were tons of vegetarian options and some vegan options, with meat eaters still being catered to as well.   The place itself was simply a lodge given a minor face lift and nothing more, which I think really adds to the character. No modern, unnecessary frills. It was relatively empty when we arrived and were waited on right away. It's a \"seat yourself\" kind of brunch (at least when we were there since there was not a large stream of people) and plenty of tables open for dining.  I will absolutely be back for the nightlife and even more brunch in the future!",

Good sized stage and excellent sound. Audio engineering (AKA \"sound guy\") knew what he was doing and had the right equipment. Diverse drink menu with good bottles (such as Hendricks Gin) and a menu of specials. Creative and fun patio and smoking area with that iconic bus with free jukebox. Staff was courteous and helpful. I didn't get to try it, but having a pizza place in the basement is a nice bonus.  Really just a well thought out and comfortable space for concerts and events. Lots of places to get away from the music and chat if you like. Restrooms were easy to locate, and, eh, clean enough.  Recommended if you want to put on or see a show.",

The food was a great surprise and the white pizza was to die for. Super friendly staff in the pizza joint. Amazing lil patio, wish it wasn't winter. Reminded me of all the fave patios in San Francisco. All in all, a super great time.  My only wish is that for concerts where people DANCE, aka Vacationer, the dining tables were a huge bummer. We had to squeeze into a little standing room between a merch table and a dining couple to dance. Hindering merch sales, but finding no where else to stand. Maybe just researching who the performer is before opening the room for the night, tables could be moved.   Love it  there though!!",

Plus, the pizza was delicious. We got two whole pies with one topping each and the total was a little over $40. The pies were huge too! We had about 12 people and weren't able to finish both pies. The crusts were thick and crispy. The outside patio area is beautiful, and they have a refurbished school bus that you can hang out in. We arrived on a Saturday night, just before the $10 cover fees started at 9 PM since there was an event going on. It was pretty loud, dark, and crowded inside during the event, so this probably isn't the greatest place if you want to grab a drink and chat; however, we went to the patio outside and still had a great time.",
