We've had their breakfast and dinner, from a breakfast burrito to the Tuesday turkey dinner, and I am always very happy when I leave. The best thing though is their burgers. Well seasoned, perfectly cooked, and juicy, this is now our go to for a great burger.  We live up the street and have seen restaurant after restaurant come in and leave soon after. We are crossing our fingers that Bob's makes it because they are awesome.",

I opted for a Belgian waffle with strawberries and whipped cream. There were MAYBE four strawberries and no whipped cream. The waitress was kind enough to add the whipped cream and bring a second cup of syrup ( One isn't enough). The coffee was rather weak, but that can be a personal preference. The wife, when seeing the prices, pulled back on her order. Still, the bill ended up being about $20 for the two of us. Not worth it, in my book.",

In short, I was pleasantly surprised and Bob's is now my go-to diner!  The food is delicious and servings usually more than I expected.  I always get breakfast, and was happy with the amount of potatoes, the way my eggs are cooked (over medium - not everyone gets it right!), and the 4, count 'em, 4 pieces of bacon.    What really sets Bob's apart is that the coffee tastes great!  IMHO, they have the best diner coffee around.  Also nice - they accept all major credit cards - much more convenient than a few other local diners that are cash only.  One caution though - the parking at the Grove Road location is scarce - the parking lot gets 100% full even when the diner itself is less than half full.",

    "text": "After looking for somewhere to have breakfast this past Sunday, I remembered that Bob's Diner had opened right down the road from me.  When we walked in it was a much better looking restaurant that used to be there. It was bright and clean. It was crowded, but the wait was short. After we were seated, the service was good and our orders were taken. Our drinks were kept full and our food arrived shortly after ordering. I had the sausage gravy and biscuits with home fries plus a pancake to share, and my girl had the mixed grill. The mixed grill looked good, but based on the description I was a bit disappointed with the size. The biscuits and gravy and pancake  looked good, but the portion of potatoes was very small. As we both started to eat, I realized that my pancake, biscuits and gravy, and potatoes were all luke warm at best and didn't taste very good because they weren't hot. Cold sausage gravy is awful! I told the waitress and she apologized and told me that she would have them remake my order. At least I could be sure they weren't just throwing it in the microwave! My girlfriend continued to eat (and share) her meal that was tasty. It took a little while, but my new order came out and I was happy that I was going to have my breakfast. Unfortunately it was not any warmer than the first one that they served me. None of it!  I told my waitress and could see just how frustrated she was. She apologized many times and said that she would remove the charge for my breakfast from our bill. She did so, and the manager came over and apologized as well. She even offered up a 5 dollar coupon for another visit. After paying my bill, we decided to use our 5 bucks on a slice of apple pie for later on. It was decent. Based on my experience, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back to a Bob's. There are plenty of other breakfast options in the area that I would rather try for a first time or return to.",

    "text": "It's opening day at Bob's in Castle Shannon and everything was great as expected for this local chain. They had been teasing the area with a huge sign by route 88, but it's finally ready! I suppose this is a four star diner, if that's a thing. The N family are strong patrons.  This Bob's is most similar to the location in Carnegie as far as the service and food, but with brand new decor and a few extra parking spaces. The only tiff I had was with the bathroom which was not touched from the take over of the failed Greek joint, but who says you can have it all. The place is actually set up a little odd with scattered booths and the full counter in the back corner. It took a few tries to find the correct entrance as well.  Even though Bob's is for breakfast, we came for early dinner, which means soup and sandwiches in my book. Luckily, one if the soups today was chicken rice which was more of a paste (in a good way?) and crazy filling. The turkey is thick, bread still from Mancini's. Add the house made Italian dressing on fresh greens and I am set. I don't want to act like this is the best food I've ever had, but I was definitely satisfied. I do wish they made their own chips, especially considering they're the standard side.  It's a great diner. Easy, not greasy, clean, friendly. And of course Bob himself was in for opening day! It's hard to not want to support him. Especially when you can end your meal with coconut cloud cake from neighbor Signature Desserts. Overall classic and simple, exactly the way it should be.",

    "text": "Hi we came to your location this am after my sons hockey game. We ordered our expensive breakfast since nothing came with sides and you do not have waffles on the kids menu only pancakes as an option. So for my 8 year old and I our total was 28.00, which is crazy! I ordered bacon but it was cooked too long that it was hard and crumbled when I bit it. I returned that. But our food was cold it was so cold inside the diner like cold enough most of the guest and us had kept their coats on. So my son refused to eat the cold waffle and was starving by the time I got home. I told the cashier when she asked how our breakfast was I said not so good. It was cold and not worth the price in my opinion. My son said the waffle tasted funny and was cold when it arrived. She said nothing in response to that. So I paid my bill and the table kept our not so great breakfast plates, went home and had to make another meal because he was still hungry. I am extremely disappointed. On a side note although our waitress was ok to us she was very unpleasant and complained openly in front of our table and the table behind us that was just seated in her area because they requested a booth the hostess replied I'm sorry they wanted to sit here. She said nasty whatever just get them drinks.....",

    "text": "Two words-Never Again. We'll start at the beginning. When we walked in it seemed a little warm. In fact it seemed warmer inside the building than it did outside and outside it was 85degrees. As we sat down we saw different types of fans were set up trying to cool the restaurant down. The air conditioner was broken. *sigh*. And we couldn't feel the air from the fans because two young boys were standing in front of them being incredibly loud and obnoxious.  We placed our order-Biscuits and Gravy for me and a Meatloaf sandwich for my hubby.  It seemed the longer we sat there the hotter it got. I used the Daily Special placard to fan myself. It was so hot that my ice in my glass melted within 5 minutes. It took FORTY MINUTES to get our meal.  My husband's meal was two pieces of thin white sandwich bread with two thin slices of meatloaf between them. It was 90% filler and 10% meat. There was a small scoop of mashed potatoes next to it and a dark brown sauce poured all over it. I tried a bite and could barely swallow it.  YUCK!! I are a couple of bites of potatoes that were on my plate. They weren't the home fries I was expecting. I then took a bite of the biscuits and gravy. It was beyond disgusting. The \"sausage\" tasted like Spam and it was pink. I wouldn't eat another bite because I didn't want to get sick from undercooked \"sausage. I was so sickened that I didn't eat another bite and left a plate full of food untouched. My husband choked his meatloaf down. He has a stronger stomach than I do.   If you see a Bib's diner just keep driving. There are better places to eat. Instead of having a vast menu of nasty food they should taper down the number of dishes offered and try to work on making the food taste edible.",

My lunch companion had French toast, thick Mancinis bread and it was ok but the bread was so thick it was just warm doughy in the center, and the side of homegrown potatoes had hair(s) on them.  The waitress was apologetic and took them off the bill.

    "text": "After having our memorial day plans deterred due to a car sick child, we were looking for a nearby restaurant to grab brunch. After calling 5 local brunch spots, I was highly disappointed that they were all closed or closing within the hour. Luckily, I remembered that a new diner had opened on Grove road. When I called Bob's, I was thrilled to find out that they were open until 2.   Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly. The hostess, noticing that I was preggo (what she didn't know was that I was actually OVERDUE) sat us in the cooler part of the restaurant. Apparently the other side was rather warm. She then proceeded to bring crayons and paper for our 2 year old. Off to a great start!  The menu is quite extensive. Everything you could want for brunch or lunch was represented on the menu, including several options for the sweet tooth. Our server arrived promptly and we were able to quickly place our order. She brought our drinks and we then waited for 20 minutes (for brunch food?). It was a bit excessive but, the restaurant was full. (Probably because it was the only place open!) When my fancy, fruity waffle arrived, I was very impressed. The waffle was the perfect combo of sweet and crispy. Topped with cut strawberries and a mound of whipped cream, it was a feast for the eyes. The kids pancake meal was also very impressive. A huge, full size pancake with mickey mouse ears, a strawberry/banana face and a slice of bacon. The overall experience was better than expected. The only downfall for me was that the inside looks like it is in need of some remodeling/updates.",

The prices are midrange for dinner, and the servings are huge, all except for the Wednesday night lasagna, which was oddly lonely on the plate.  Parking is a bit of a pain. They have more tables than parking spots, so you're pretty much guaranteed to be out of luck if there's any wait time.",

I bought them 1 order in case they weren't good.  My parents are very picky on the quality of the meat and taste.  They just called me and said that they tasted as good as my Dad's mother's who immigrated from Poland, and my mom's who learned the recipe from watching her make them.  Bottom line, 2 huge peppers (enough for. 2 and you will be full) with homemade mashed potatoes, gravy, and a side salad was more then enough to share. I can't wait to go back to Pgh to have them.  Service was great, place was clean, prices were very reasonable and...The best stuffed green peppers!  Highly recommend!",

We like going to diners for breakfast, and we've been to another Bob's Diner location in the past so I knew what to expect food-wise.  I really wanted oatmeal and I really did not want home fries. So I got my order a la carte and the cost came to be about the same as if I had ordered one of the predefined menu items.  I was glad about that.  I got two eggs and toast.  I chose over easy and wheat.  The eggs were great but the toast was over-toasted.  Not quite burnt but too toasted to actually soak up the egg yolk.  I also got bacon.  The bacon tasted fine but I'm finding that I don't care for the thick sliced variety.  I prefer thin and crispy, so next time I'll probably omit the side of bacon.  The oatmeal was very good.  I really enjoy a good bowl of oatmeal.  It came with raisins, brown sugar, and milk (couple ounces.)  Of course I got coffee, and this is why I'm leaning toward three stars.  It just wasn't hot.  And the waitress did not come around nearly enough to refill the cup.",

The servings are huge! My favorite was the French toast. The slices of bread are thick and fluffy; they almost tasted like doughnuts. Pancakes were ok; they were huge but tasted like bisquick pancakes. Everything else was very satisfying as well.   Overall, I really enjoyed our brunch here.

    "text": "Here's the deal: I like diners. I eat healthy the majority of the time (though this past month, not so much), and cook /bake from scratch. And I realuze diner food is more rib-sticking comfort food, and that you're going to loosen your belt another notch or two.  I was here with Daughter and a friend a year and a half ago. I vividly remember not being too tickled to pay $25+ for 2 pancake breakfasts and drinks. And it's ridiculous to pay $3 MORE to add meat to breakfasts that already average $9.  So, though really  hungry,  and not too happy that I took a T, and walked a quarter mile on the side of the busy road, just to find a sign on the door stating Trolley Barn closed for the weekend. I trudged along the busy road to Bob's, determined not to spend Daughter's inheritance on breakfast.  I ordered the least expensive breakfast $2.95 for 2 eggs and toast. No Texas Toast. Italian? Fine.Then I found afterwards,  that they have seeded rye.  I ordered eggs over medium. Very runny. Server finally came back, and reordered them, after telling her I just wanted a little liquid yolk. Same. Third time wasn't a charm. Asked her again how to order them. She said over medium hard. No luck. Finally, I asked the REALLY nice cook herself how I should order them. She said \"over hard\". Fourth plate was perfect. Still, it shouldn't take 4 tries, especially when I kept asking server (never did get her name) \"How should I order these to get just a little liquid yolk?\"   She wasn't particularly attentive,  as she was alone serving 5 booths, 1 table, and me (Counter Creature).  I said to the server they'll probably be slamned because Trolley Barn is closed, and she said they're always slammed. Okay...  I can't imagine returning.  I used the ladies room. Dirty, sticky floor, and smelled awful. The cakes, carrot included, were sitting in the sun, across from their front window. Not chilled. ALERT: The server said the cakes come from Signature Desserts! You know, the ones who sell stuff after flies were on it. The one server (not mine. Dark hair, glasses, black outfit, hair in bun), defended serving goidies previously enjoyed by flies. Eeewww! I couldn't pay and leave fast enough.",

We were traveling from our home in Texas to Itica New York, and we look for places like this along the way. This was one of the highlights of the trip. Awesome food. I had the best chicken salad on a warm, buttery croissant with homemade onion rings, Broccoli, and Cole Slaw. Large portions, I'll tell ya. We thouroughly enjoyed this clean little place with fresh fliers on every table. Oh. Good Coffee, too!",

Sausage on the breakfast sandwich was a link sliced in half rather than a patty, so you only taste it in some of your bites. First impressions count, probably won't be back. There are other local diners that do breakfast better.",

    "text": "What an awful Monday ... my son started back to CCAC only to pass out and go by ambulance to Allegheny ER. Well by the time we got out of there he was starving and thirsty as all heck. We figured lets just get back into South Hills because the traffic was starting to get bad! We stopped at Bobs in Castle Shannon...we figured its been 2 years since last going we will give it a try again. We pulled up at 4:10p it looked closed. No cars hum... we went in yep open just empty. Not a good sign at that time. The hostess was very negative looking her she was with the district manager speaking with a delivery service issue. She gave us a nasty look as if we were bothering her and left us standing there for which empty table she would grace us with. Finally she came over and asked if we wanted to sit ..hum sure lets give it a go! Sat us told us who waitress would be ..omg... I'm sorry but the woman was older and everytime she came to our table she would say awwwwww.. like a heard of babies was present?! She repeated her name when she approached and left after awhile we realize that it wasn't for us to remember but herself. She forgot items, she would come to table we'd tell her needs and wants then she'd walk away to begin chatting with other person there. Forgetting us! My son whos autistic was very clear and i went back over it with her on how important that his needs be met. Not a hard task. Burger medium, with American cheese, no veggies on it no condiments, plain just cheese, nothing on plate but fries. The bun was soaked with butter inside and out it looked gross and slimey... being autistic his sensorys were being challenged. I told her and she did typical walk away and chat with other server. The whole time thats going on the DMand hostess were chatting about issues cleanliness super your making me sick pointing out issues around the place. Then the woman proceeded to bash other employees gee wonder why they are calling off ..no customers because the over priced food that is burnt, not made following a specific order, items missing but sure charged for, no drink refills, the service stinks each time we have been there not only do they not check back and follow through needs and issues they don't  back eachother up. Forget it you get a coffee they will walk to their tables only with a pot and not stop even when you ask them to. On the way out i brought up to the DM the issues the hostess woman sure getting smart mouthed with me when i told her negative issues employee issues keep in the back not on the floor shes rolling eyes at me nasty negative screw face on and i told him to look at it. Thats exactly why employees and customers dont want to go there. The woman blamed my son for the bun of grossness thats what we do i am told well thats why we the customer were very clear about our order..now my son who was in the ER 7 hours still wouldn't eat that burger and i wouldn't have either slimed. Sure charged us. Sure didn't understand what I was telling them in the still empty restaurant at 5:30p. They are right fighters all the way to going to have to close up shop. It is not your way.. it is the customer's way!",

It was not crowded at all with many empty tables, which typically means fast service! We were sat at our table and waited 10+ minutes and still no one came. There was a waitress cleaning tables in area and a hostess who sat more people behind us. Still no one came. So we left. We shouldn't have to call a waiter over or have to tell someone to service us. We won't be back. Extremely disappointed!",

We were immediately seated with menus and asked for drinks. The server was very attentive. I ordered the Mancini raisin French toast and eggs. They were two thick slices with their secret batter. They tasted great and fluffy. Anything with Mancini bread is going to be good. They had a nice breakfast menu and the prices are great. I can see why my grandfather loves this place. If you think parking is minimal you can always park around the back. They did mess up my moms omelette but they fixed it immediately and made a new one in a timely manner. Since they fixed it so quickly and apologized my mom didn't think twice about it. The one thing I miss about Pittsburgh is the great service and family restaurants.",

    "text": "I've been to a couple of Bob's establishments over the past few years, and this newest Castle Shannon location was where my soaraway brunch experience to date was had, this newest station in the ginger-haired man's mini-empire demonstrating not a single kink in terms of service or food.   Formerly Hanni's and before that Opa, this Bob's features the requisite bright white decor punctuated by the franchise's soon-to-be-iconic \"solar\" logo, the interiors portending simple canteen fare that aims to make patrons smile and fuel them up for the day ahead.   Quiche. Growing up, it always conjured visions of milquetoast men in tennis attire. \"Real men\" didn't eat it for breakfast as the maxim went, and so I didn't. That was until my sister made some for me once, and I came to the realization that I was essentially eating frittata or scrambled eggs re-imagined as a superior dish.    For some reason, I eschewed ordering quiche at the other Bob's strongholds, but on this morning, when I heard our excellent server rattle off the varieties of it on the bill of fare (Bob's usually offers several different kinds daily), I stopped her when she uttered the words \"Bacon Cheddar Asparagus.\"  Bacon. Cheddar. Asparagus.   And it was nothing short of...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-ak6wR-PGmM&s=71eb54c694b30023a022d4f13203e6679b80eed1479f20d5f1db826a5f6cb8cd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=-ak6...</a>   The exteriors were browned like a quaint country omelet, but inside the wedge of egg, nothing but unadulterated, buttery yellow velvet could be found, aside from the luxurious Bacon, Cheddar, and Asparagus of course. The bacon naturally punctuated everything with its inherent saltiness, richness and crisp texture, but the green shoots were toothsome as well, and the cheese merely brought zing and amplified the creaminess. Dense yet flaky, the pie crust was a prime component also.\"Real men\" that still resemble a 70's Burt Reynolds may pass on it, but they're only missing out on some real good eatin' if ya ask me. I guess I should have started brunching with Alan Alda as an impressionable lad.  There was more to come. The opening sunrise salvo consisted of a briny and immensely flavorful and meaty corned beef hash that was riddled with a freshly chopped and vibrant tandem of caramelized onions and green bell peppers.   Flanking the quiche was a refreshingly chilly fruit medley made up of sliced banana, strawberry, honeydew melon, and cantaloupe as well as a serving of home fried cubed redskin spuds so tender, oily, and cunningly seasoned, I had half a mind to take them home and turn them into some of the best potato salad ever crafted in my kitchen (I don't boil 'em well enough half the time). Not everyone does home fries well. Bob's does them exceedingly so.   I get the feeling that this was one diner that Bob merely threw against a wall. I'm wagering that it'll stick. A ten-minute wait for a table and a line of hungry customers wrapped around the bend tells no lies.",
