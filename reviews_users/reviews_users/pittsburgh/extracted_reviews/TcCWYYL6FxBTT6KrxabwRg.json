    "text": "After leaving California and the glorious Mexican food it has to offer..I thought I had condemned myself to taco hell when I couldn't find decent tacos around town. Enter Edgar and these marvelous tacos. I was at the Strip with a friend on a recent cold, fall (but basically winter) day when there wasn't a lot of foot traffic on the street. We were starving and crabby. I walked past Edgar Tacos and stopped in my tracks. I saw the Mexican hot chocolate being stirred, my eyes got wide at the sight of salsa, and the smell had me salivating. I ordered two chicken tacos with everything and boy was it so worth it. I didn't even care how cold it was anymore. These were it for me and I ate them with incredible joy. The salsa was fresh and the chicken was cooked perfectly. I'm going back ASAP!",

Beef, steak, and chicken .... with almost any topping you could conjure up in that taco fueled mind of yours. Fresh as the day is long ... what?  I already said fresh?  Well I guess it deserved a second mentioning then didn't it? Everything is fresh ... Everything is awesome.  Edgar makes the world a little better with his awesome food.  I work 1 block from this place and sometimes I walk by just for the smell, 98% of those times I don't even make it a block before turning around and indulging my addiction.  That's right boys and girls .... Addicting is a word you could associate with Edgar's food.  Do yourself a favor ...... Go grab some REAL tacos, burritos, and every other \"o's\" you can find here.  The \"o\" is for HOOOOOOLY Frijoles this place is wicked awesome!!",

Instead of just one veggie taco option (like beans and cheese) they had a soyrizo option to compliment the omnivorous chorizo taco.  SOYrizo. Get it? It was quite good.  These tacos are super messy, so don't trick yourself into thinking you can eat and drive with these guys... take a seat nearby and enjoy!",

The setup seems fine though, and I frequently see customers clambering over both. That said, while I haven't been to Edgars' main restaurant, I can vouch for their stand. Their variety definitely beats Reyna's stand, while prices are a tad higher. In addition to all sorts of tacos (including fish and shrimp!), they have some choices of empanadas, quesadillas, etc.  Tried the carnitas, carne asada, lengua, and barbacoa--all were delicious, and you can tell them to put the toppings of your choice while they make it (asking them to put everything is by far the best choice). The guy who takes your order is super friendly, with an \"hola, como estas\" for every customer. They also have watermelon agua fresca and horchata, both of which seem freshly made; the watermelon was delightful. Finally, while the wait may be a little longer than other stands, there are some complimentary chips and salsa for you while you are waiting.   10/10 would return again.",

    "text": "This is a cute little taco stand next to Reyna's on 21st.  I ended up stopping by here with my fiance for a light afternoon snack after our lunch wasn't enough food for either of us.  The stand wasn't too much to look at as it was a couple of things cobbled together but there was a sign proclaiming their tacos to be the best in the city.  As such I decided to go with a chorizo taco while my fiance went with the shrimp at $3 each.  The man behind the grill cooked both of them up fresh while also warming the soft tortilla shells.  He asked us if we wanted everything on them and we both said yes not knowing what everything was. It ended up being some lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream, cilantro, salt and freshly squeezed lime juice.  I ate my taco right after receiving it and it certainly hit the spot.  The temperature of it was perfect while the chorizo had a nice kick and my favorite part was the lime juice which gave a nice little sourness to combat the heat.  My fiance also really enjoyed her taco and the shrimp that I tried was good.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  They had a number of interesting tacos, burritos and empanadas that I noticed on the menu that I am sure I would love.",

Their tacos are incredible! So fresh & delicious-- and affordable at only $5 for 2. Over the years, I have tried all of the tacos they offer and they never disappoint! The fish is prob my favorite -- and def try the free salsas they have on the counter! The salsa verde is excellent. One bite of Edgar's tacos & you'll be hooked!",

The tacos made out on the street outside of Reyna Foods in the Strip - awesome, and definitely the best tacos I have had anywhere. The ingredients are all great, but the grilled flavor of the tortilla and the fresh ingredients, included the freshly squeezed lime juice, complete everything and make every bite wonderful. The beef tongue and fish tacos were fantastic. Also, if you like some heat, try their homemade sauces in the big plastic jars at the end of the line. Now this is street food, baby!",

    "text": "Right in the heart of the Saturday afternoon market on the Strip, Edgar's and the competing taco stand just around the corner contribute to one of the best smelling street corners ever, with sweet and earthy tendrils of corn tortillas wafting by and hints of the various meats cooking on their griddles.  With some of our brunch targets packed to the gills on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, my girlfriend and I switched to snacking at the various food stands on the Strip, with Edgar's being the main stop. I went with a chicken and lamb barbacoa tacos and their watermelon agua fresca to drink. The lamb was lightly topped while the chicken was more generously topped, while you're left ot finish it off with the salsa of your choice, and I just went with what looked like salsa verde.  Sitting down at one of the handful of tables next to their stand, we dug right in. The lamb was tender and flavourful, and the sauce it was in kept it from getting too dry. There was a little bit of spice to the guac and a nice fresh pop from the pico and all of that was evened out by the queso fresco. The chicken had a mild flavour, but it was tender and moist, and topped equally as well as the lamb.  The watermelon agua fresca was fantastic. It tasted simply of watermelon with very little, if any, extra sweetening, just letting the fruit stand on its own.  Edgar's was an excellent spot in a equally great little area. Hit this place up if you're in the Strip.",

Edgar has a little stand next to Pamelas diner in the strip. The taco selection here is amazing. He always has specials which are highly recommended. I always get tacos, it doesn't matter what type, but make sure you get tacos! Once they grace your lips you will understand why Edgars is rated 5 stars across the board on yelp!   I also recommend getting a horchada drink as well, best I've ever had. If you have ever had horchada you know how delicious it is, if you've never had horchada then Edgars is the best place for your first ever experience.   I am literally licking my lips drooling and my stomach is rumbling just from writing this review thinking about Edgars tacos even though I just ate. I will be heading there first thing in the AM!

    "text": "I have been meaning to try out the tacos from this place, and I finally received the chance to do so this weekend.  I visited the Strip to try some of the hot chocolate from Mon Aimee (alas, it was out--apparently, they run out around noon) and visit a winery, and was not planning to order food.  However, as I walked around the corner on my way out of the winery, I was seduced by the smell of roasting meat, despite it being around 4pm.  I ordered two tacos, one chicken and one carnitas (pork), with everything, which cost $5.  When I ordered, the guy at the stand (Edgar, I assume), asked me if I wanted anything to drink, but I passed.  As I was waiting for my order, two women came up and ordered some tacos, and one also asked for a cup of the hot chocolate, which made my ears perk up (why did they not mention that drinks meant hot chocolate?!?).  Of course, then I had to get some hot chocolate, too!  Upon receiving my hot chocolate and tacos, I sat down at one of the adjoining tables to consume them.  True to their claim, the tacos were some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh--the only other ones as good that I've had are from Las Palmas in Oakland.  In fact, I ate the chicken one so quickly that I didn't even think to add salsa to it, but it was still delicious!  I added salsa to the carnitas one before eating it, which made it all the more flavorful and delicious.  Both of the tacos were savory and crispy, and I greatly enjoyed them both, though I slightly preferred the chicken one.  The hot chocolate, which was a Mexican version with cinnamon, added a nice sweet note and finish to the meal, and filled me with warmth on this chilly day, helping to make up for the earlier disappointment from lack of the hot chocolate that I'd sought.  Aside from the quality of food, the service was very friendly and pretty efficient.  The only drawback is that this is a food stand, which means that if the weather's unfavorable, you're stuck eating outside.  (Of course, there's nothing they can do about this, hence why I'm not detracting any stars.)  Given that I live and work in Oakland, Las Palmas is generally more convenient when I'm craving tacos. However, when I'm wandering around the Strip and am hungry, Edgar's surely hits the spot!",

The other day I went to get tacos and the chorizo special he was cooking smelled so outrageously amazing I told him, \"If I could cook like this, I might finally find a husband!\"  He made sure I watched him make it so I would know how.

The workers are friendly and accommodating and his newer location has a sign out front saying they now cater (I don't remember this at the last location). I'm so happy they are expanding and look forward to many more taco stops this summer.",

My coworkers and I loved it so much, we came back a second day in a row. I've gotten the burrito, which was HUGE. I couldn't finish it all. It was packed with rice and beans, onion, peppers, beef and everything in between. I also tried the beef empanada which was clearly very homemade and good!! We also shared chips queso/guac. Queso is so creamy and jalapeno and guac was very flavorful!  The second day I got the mole enchiladas and street corn. SO GOOD. Flavorful and satisfying. You can taste all the elements of the mole. And the street corn was sweet and creamy and a little spicy.   I can't wait to literally try everything on their menu. Not only does this place have great food, it's run by Edgar (I am assuming) and two other ladies. They are always so sweet and nice! Can't wait to tell everyone about this place and to go back!",

Both dips as well as the chips had a unique flavor and texture and really impressed us. The dips were very creamy and reminiscent of the flavors they were suppose to represent with the perfect level of kick to them. The chips were freshly made and had a uniquely soft crunch to them.  The chicken quesadilla was HUGE and was big enough for both of us which we both felt was a great deal for the price. Succulent chicken, a toasty tortilla, melted cheesiness and some veggies to add freshness is exactly what you look for in a chicken and cheese quesadilla.   We look forward to coming back here soon and trying some of the other delicious food on the menu.",

It had a kick and a good flavor. I wish I could figure out how to recreate it with spices! The corn shells were not overly thick, hard or rubbery. They were perfect.  The people on the food truck were lovely. They had 4 types of salsa, forks and napkins readily available. I added the medium salsa to a portion of my taco, and it went very well with it.

You walk-in, order from the menu on the wall, and then wait at a table with the number they give you. They shout out the # when the food is ready and with a simple wave of your number the waitress found me and brought out my food. Since the ordering is at the front and there was only 1 cashier, the line got a bit long since my group was about 20 and there were also other patrons. This occurred around 3:00 on a sunny Saturday.  The food was really cheap, and it was good. I could have gone for more food since it wasn't a huge serving, but it hit the spot and accomplished what I set out for. There's also free chips with guac and queso.  The inside had lots of decorations drafting down from the ceiling, as well as stuff on the walls. It made it feel like an authentic Mexican place. There was also futbol playing from the World Cup which added to that element.  The owner said that the liquor license was delayed about a month. I wasn't able to order a Corona, but anticipate by late July or August that the drafts will be flowing. At least I hope so for their sake. Either way, it's a cool place to check out near the strip.",

The menu has a few tacos that are 2 for $5.00 but most of the selections are $3.50.  My barbacoa and chorizo tacos were good but not anything special.  The sauce bar is nice but it was a little messy when I was getting my sauces; thought it probably doesn't take much for just one person to spill stuff on the bar.  The place is kind of amusing with all the menus pasted on a board behind the cash register and you can see some of the kitchen staff cooking.  The room is kind of dark and dingy; it has been a few different restaurants over the years and has not been updated.",

It currently looks like they're shaping the the place up ... getting their alcohol license in place, giving the interior some sprucing up, etc ... so I'm rating 5 stars for the authentic Mexican street grub and friendly staff.  I just added the new location to Yelp myself after seeing only the old street stand was listed and I'd like them to have a strong 5 star base to start from.

The shrimp in the tacos are small and fried, but equally delicious.  I like how he has multiple salsas you can put on them.  Even though I'm obsessed with his tacos the hibiscus tea was to die for. I could drink that every day. Soooooo good!  The other great thing about Edgar is he is extremely friendly and his staff are as well. They are also very efficient.

The workers inside were very gracious and helpful so it made the experience even better. I'll be back to try some different stuff they offer like the marinated lamb quesadilla which sounded great. Great place at a very decent price for tacos .",
