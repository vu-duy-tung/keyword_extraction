    "text": "This is their newest location in downtown Pittsburgh on Forbes across from the Tower at PNC.  There are about 10 tiny tables in this tiny location, but enough for people that want lunch and want to sit.  I came in around 12:30 on a Wednesday and there were still empty seats.  The counter was laden with spectacular looking pastries and breads.  I wanted to grab something to bring back to the office and share, so I had them put in a variety of macarons and these little tiny cakes that I was told were pistachio and raspberry.   The little cakes were amazing.  The macarons are perfectly flavored and very buttery.  For 5 of each, the total came to less than 8 bucks which is pretty incredible for this place.    I definitely want to come back and try the he macarons.  Bluebird Kitchen down the street has some of the best, so La Gourmandine has some competition in the area, but it's a welcome addition to the downtown food landscape.",

I do like a certain other regional chain bakery with the French name just fine too, but nothing beats the realer deal, La Gourmandine. It's located just across from the PNC Tower and is stacked with all my delicious familiar favorites that I usually get in the Lawrenceville location, but with the key difference that it's spacious and has seating for dining in. Which I haven't done yet, but will strongly consider for lunch in the future.  For now, I use La Gourmandine as motivation to get out of bed on cold mornings and come downtown instead of working from home in my pjs, haha.  I used to get my once-in-awhile-treat of almond croissants from the Gaby & Jules counter in Market Street Grocery, but even though they are closer to my office, I will be getting them from here because the former can't be bothered to deliver their baked goodies downtown before 8:30 am. The staff is very friendly and fast and is great about explaining what each pastry is, and is quick to tell you what to get in the morning before it sells out for the day.",

    "text": "La Gourmadine is one of the best French bakeries in the city and I was thrilled to have the opportunity to visit it downtown now located where the Penn Ave fish market was previously housed.  This is the 4th location of this established business with the other 3 located in Lawrenceville, Mt Lebanon, and Hazelwood. The menu is identical to the other three with coffee and expresso drinks available.  My favorite pastry is their famed almond covered danish but haven just ate decided to settle for a couple of their macaroons. One was chocolate banana flavored and the other was strawberry. Believe me, it did not disappoint and with the flaky crust literally tore apart as I ate it. So good!!  This location is extremely small but they have a gender neutral restroom. Free WiFi is available. Passcode is on one of their chalkboards. They have a small seating area which I have found to be True in their other locations as well.  Want lunch? Yes, they still have their hoagie style sandwiches you would find at the other locations. They also have a daily quiche. The only major difference is that this location gets most of their products from the Hazelwood location. Few items are made in house. Prices have gone up slightly but still very reasonable for the quality of food you get here.  Take out as always is available. I did chat with one of the counter persons who waited on me because I wanted to find out why the are only open on weekdays. Basically this location caters to the working since their hours pretty much match working hours. They are closed Sat and Sun. He did tell me that they had recently opened and may consider expanding into weekends if there is enough draw.  It is my hope that they do. I normally don't go to town during the week unless absolutely necessary and this would be a great spot to get a great sandwich or if you are daring one of their French gourmet breakfast pastries. Refrigerated items are also available along with some breads.  Located on Forbes Ave near Cardamone's beauty parlor there is construction on that side of Forbes if you are headed down from Smithfield St.",

My coworker and I split the ham and Swiss sandwich and the prosciutto and pickles sandwich. Both were great! The little bit of butter on them just makes them so simple but SO good. We also split a croissant and I had this chocolate lava cake (prob not what it was called but it was DELICIOUS).   The staff were all very pleasant and nice.   My reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the set of refrigerators that have REALLY heavy slamming doors and are close to some of the seating (where we were seated) every time they were opened,which was a lot because they were restocking, the slamming noise just was so loud. Prob wouldn't even mention it if it wasn't a Bakery/coffee shop that has more of a quaint and quiet feel.",

My friend and I wished they offered a 1/2 sandwich and soup combo.. Soup sounded good but not with a full sandwich already, nor for an extra $5. I realize they're new and might offer something like that down the road.  I got an almond croissant to share which was AMAZING!

The choux was perfect! Not too sweet, bite sized, and perhaps too easy to eat. The almond croissant does look a little flat, like others have said. But the flavor! And the denser, slightly chewy texture! It's a must try! This was our first time in Pittsburgh, and I seriously regret not buying at least a dozen of them. The staff was super nice, too!",

This time around I tried their Almond Croissant and the Pickle Prosciutto sandwich.   The croissant was really good with a lot of almonds. The almond extract is pretty strong, so just be aware of that while ordering it! The sandwich comes on a fresh baked baguette, which is nice and crunchy on the outside. The prosciutto and mini pickles make for a great mix of flavors!   The atmosphere is very relaxing, sometimes I enjoy reading a book here because it's pretty quiet. The staff is always friendly an inviting.   Overall, it's a great place to stop by when you get the chance",

The chocolate croissant was very flaky and decadent without being greasy. The chocolate was distributed nicely throughout the pastry, so you didn't get a giant mouthful of solid chocolate at once, as often happens with these pastries.   I would come early for lunch, though, it seems like they run out of sandwich and lunch items pretty quickly.   They also have a frequent diner club where you can earn points and get discounts. Seating is a little limited, but they do have a few cafe tables outside.",

Of course I had to go back the next day (let's be honest, if I was still in Pittsburgh I would've gone back today too), this time I had an almond croissant.  Of course it was delicious too.

There are a few tables inside so you can dine in and there is limited outdoor seating in the summer. The bread is all obviously made in house and incredibly fresh. I prefer the prosciutto and pickle sandwich but the quiches are a great hot lunch item. Soups vary daily and are served with bread.  All the pastries are can't miss. The tart aux framboise is pictured and is soft and sugary on the inside. The chocolate almond croissant is my personal favorite. All the pastries are sugary, flakey, and light. La Gourmandine also offers a loyalty program for frequent customers like myself",

Although I have been there countless times, I figured I might discover some new things as well and one of the things that caught our eyes was a video that suggested La Gourmandine!  The video made a persuasive case and given that the pastry shop was less than five minutes from our hotel, we made a beeline there after dropping off our bags!  Upon entering the shop, you'll see a drool worthy case full of sandwiches and savories, followed by another case full of pastries and sweets.  It was heavenly!  Service was so friendly, too and we even got a free little bite (can't recall what the guy said it was but I believe if you check in on Yelp it offers the same thing).  My pain au chocolate was so flaky and the chocolate so delicious, I felt like I was in heaven while eating it.  Definitely check out this place if you're downtown.  And based on what fellow Yelper Eileen S told me, there are a few locations in the surrounding area so look for them if you're anywhere near Pittsburgh!",

They have so many Because of that I couldn't wait to go back there again.   Comparing the pricing New York, I am so surprised and we paid $9.90 for two Croissants, black tea and I iced coffee.

I recently stopped in on a whim after lunch to check out what they had and all of it looks absolutely incredible. I opted to get the cocoa covered spherical pastry - forgot what it was called but you'll know it when you see it. Absolutely amazing, had almost like a creme brulee and custard center sitting atop a crunchy caramel base. Absolutely delightful. The next time I went in, I tried their gourmadise pastry which is a croissant filled with cream and chocolate chips, may be one of the best pastries I've ever had. Their chocolate almond croissants are also to die for!   What I've learned recently is they also make a focaccia pizza that they sell near the cash register. DEFINITELY one of the best quick lunch items I've come across in downtown! It's filling, the dough is light yet fluffy, has a ton of flavor and doesn't feel oily or leave you in a coma after like regular pizza does (at least to me). The sauce is plentiful and zesty, and the cheese and basil accompanies the focaccia very well. Did I mention it's also only $4.55? Pair that with a hefty pastry and you've got a flavorsome, quick ~$7 lunch. Will definitely be back for more of their pizzas and to try out their other baked items!",

Then they opened up a shop in downtown Pittsburgh, not far from where I worked. I was SO excited check them out, and they absolutely lived up to the citywide hype!  This downtown location is pretty cozy, but they did a great job of utilizing the space they have. There are some tables and seats mostly lined along one of the walls, with most of the space allowing for foot traffic to look at all the goodies on display while walking up to the register. Staff members are quick and good at what they do, ensuring that the line moves at a pretty reasonable place for how popular La Gourmandine is.  As for the goodies themselves, can you say divine? I'm in love with their almond croissant in particular - made with the lightest pastry dough, stuffed full of sweet flavorful goodness, and topped as high as possible with crunchy almonds. It's possibly the best baked good I've ever eaten, no joke.  Whatever your carby preference may be - \"plain\" bread, Danish, sweet cakes to cookies, savory concoctions - there's probably something here for you. Granted, this also means that dieters should probably steer clear of this place altogether. Fellow carb lovers, however, should go forth and enjoy this place as much as I do!",

But the other day, I had a craving for a good ol' homemade pastry. I passed a Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks along the way. However, I wanted the real thing from a French inspired bakery. La Gourmandine offers a variety of pastry from crescents, eclairs to quiches. Prices range from $2-$4 per pastry. But believe me, it's worth it. With the help of my YELP family, I tried the most reviewed, the almond crescent. DE-LIC-IOUS! Great almond flavor that was not too overpowering. The pastry was buttery and flaky! I also tried the apricot crescent! I'm a sucker for fruit fillings! I got a traditional crescent for my colleague. All three cost me around $8, but it was worth it!",

    "text": "This is probably one of the very few good bakeries in Pittsburgh. I got the chocolate croissant which was the right amount of flaky, crunchy, and softness. I also really liked the dark chocolate and buttery flavor that was not overwhelmingly greasy like some other croissants can be.  I also got the apple tarte which was good, but just average.  When I was here the almond croissant looked a bit flat for a croissant which is why I decided not to get it. But after reading some of the other reviews on here, I'll be trying it out next time!",

    "text": "We've been to many different bakeries and theirs is very authentic. I've been to France four times and they offer the same beautiful and delicious pastries you'd find there for a reasonable price.   We've tried several things there since they've opened. My family loves the butter and almond croissants. My husband and I love the pan au chocolate. Ah-mazing! This past time we tried the Black Forrest Cake, which was good. We loved the cherry inside. We had a little chocolate flourless cake too, which was also very good. The little bag of Madeleines were good too. Macarons are always good. We try different types every time we go. It's fun to try new flavors. There are so many different pastries to try.   Go check it out if you want to try different types of authentic French pastries. It's exciting they have so many different locations across town. Can't wait to try the one downtown. We love visiting the Lawrenceville location.",

I ended up with the chocolate banana, and even not being a banana fan, I found it to be quite good.   I also had a bostock which was quite good. Crisp, satisfying and something you won't find just anywhere.",

Seriously, everything is buttery and flakey and sweet and fruity and delicious.   I've never been to France, but I friends visited from France and I brought them a sampling and they couldn't stop raving.   This morning I picked up a small box of croissants and tartines for the office... people thanked me emphatically.   This place is the real deal and worth checking out!",
