Burger was quite amazing; On par if not better than BRGR and Burgatory, but instead of shakes, they have a better beer and whiskey selection.",

    "text": "My husband ask me out for a afternoon date. We visited many stores at the strip and he planned a wonderful lunch spot at Winghart's. I have not ordered a burger out in years. We had wonderful customer service from Kelly. She sold the burger and shared the process. The meat is ground daily and the fries take a 4 day process.Our cocktails were spot on. It is rare to find wonderful food and terrific service and good drinks all in one spot. We left a very nice tip as Kelly really deserved it. This establishment was a great time and made my date with my husband of 25 years perfect. We live far from south side but if it is gonna be this good we will be back. There was something to look at everywhere art on the walls an cool decor. I have 2 boys and they would of loved Kelly she was very cute. Thank you yelp. My husband looks at your site for ideas for our dates and this was definitely and good one.",

Of course still a good draft list-ordered a Green flash west coast IPA. On this visit my boyfriend and I split an order of the poutine and a dozen tikka masala wings. I had never had the wings there before but the sauce was off the chain and most of the wings were very meaty. The sauce wasn't overly spicy either. The poutine was pretty good, the gravy was not as salty as the gravy at Station Street. Service at the bar was efficient and friendly too. This is always a stellar spot to grab a quick bite when in the south side.",

They serve your standard Pittsburgh bar fare - burgers, wings, fries - but offer some more creative touches to their menu.   Definitely get a burger here, they have a combination for every palate. From the basic cheeseburger to the Shipwreck with Brie, caramelized onions, and truffle oil. Fries are ordered separately and easy specialize and split with friends. The seasoned fries are well worth the slight up charge. Only downside is the ambiance, but that is expected in South Side. I would imagine the other location has a more appealing atmosphere.",

The burgers are big and from what my husband says, are delish. At both locations. Pierogies yum.

If you get lucky, you sometimes happen upon a bar that does everything exceptionally well. One such bar is Wingharts On the Southside. The food is soooooo fresh, Pierogis made daily along with the beef for the burgers that is ground every morning. They also make their specialty mac and cheese to order, no precooked  soggy nonsense. This makes a difference! In addition to the standard bar fare, the surprise you with funnel cake covered with bacon and beer cheese sauce. We had the pierogis, funnel cake, mac and cheese, pizza, and a spicy burger, all were AMAZING! What got the fifth star from me was the service. Bartender Rae and chef Drew were excellent. They were attentive and when asked for menu suggestions, they were spot on. They help elevate Wingharts above the hundred other bars on Carson Street. I would highly recommend this little gem!",

For the hype surrounding the pierogies I thought they could have been a tad better. While solid, they were doused in sour cream and it times it took away from the pierogi.  Service: I thought the service was spotty even though the crew seemed like there were enough bodies to be able to handle the Friday Night 3/4 full crowd from about 8-930pm. We sat at the bar and felt like at times we were being ignored when I tried to place a drink order.  Would I go back? Likely, because I didn't get to try the pizza.

Shipwreck Burger - out of control good.  I loved it.  Many times truffle anything can be overpowering if they have too heavy of a hand with it, but in this case it just helped to funk up the burger just enough and the patty was amazing.  Also ordered rare and actually received rare!  Nadalee Burger - really delicious.  So good I was only able to try a bite, but enough that I could say I understand why I was torn between this one and the one I ordered.   Fries with beer cheese and bacon - I am so glad we only ordered one order of fries.  The order was huge and definitely defeated us.  The fries stayed crisp even under the mound of cheese and the bacon was delicious.    This is definitely the best burger I have had to date in Pittsburgh! I can't wait to go back and try out the pizzas which looked delicious as it was delivered to the other diners around us.",

The bros were out full force but Winghart seemed to be one of the least amateur establishments of the strip. The blaring electroni-bro music didn't bother me too much, I just needed a burger and a brew. I have minimalist taste buds so the menu options were doing the very most, IMO. I was going for a simple burger with swiss but they didn't have swiss so the bartender recommended a swiss like cheese for me. The burger was ok, I've had better. I ordered it medium well but it was over cooked. My husband got the chili cheese fries and they were very dry and bleh.  The staff is super nice though and welcoming. If I were to visit again, I would just stick to the bar.",

First, and again this maybe postmates fault but, we ordered \"a dozen\" wings extra crispy for $13. When it arrived the wings were far from crispy and there was only 8 of them. I never would have paid $13 for just 8 wings. Secondly, my wife ordered one of their well known burgers and asked for it medium-well. The burger we received was rare at best... Completely inedible for my wife, hence her medium-well order. Lastly, she asked for the sauce on the side because she was not sure if she would like it, and of course it was served on the burger instead of on the side. When we called to ask for a refund or some other sort of compensation we were told there was nothing they could do and that they were sorry because they had a \"new cook.\" I wish we had someone right next to us to donate the food to because we had to throw the entire $45 order out. We will never be returning.",

We ordered cokes and they only have a house made cola that tastes like pure carbonated water. Bleh!  We ended up with water.  I ordered the Denny double Bleu burger and a side of potato salad. The burger was literally a bun, burger, and 2 types of Bleu cheese. The meat was good and it had a good bun to meat ratio but I've had better burgers. The potato salad was not my cup of tea. It tasted like it had equal parts potatoes and onions. I'm taking it home to my hubby who loves onions. He will be thrilled.  My son ordered a Tatonka Chicken pizza. It was a bit heavy handed on the Bleu cheese but we lived the crust. My son ordered a side of plain fries and that was probably the best thing we had. The fries are a hand cut looking fry dusted with a little something sweet and salt. It's the perfect combo.  The atmosphere in the front of the restaurant was brightly lit and more of a restaurant atmosphere. We sat in the back which was dark and the music was almost too loud to talk (probably because we sat at a huge table made for four or more people). I wish we had sat up front.  I usually give a place two tries but I think this one trip gave me a good enough picture to know that there doesn't need to be a second visit.  The best part of our trip was our server. He was super nice and super friendly.",

My group of four headed out on a Tuesday night and were met with a nearly empty Wingharts.  Throughout the course of our visit one other table arrived and a couple of other patrons here and there. It appeared that the bartender was the only server on site, but not big deal consider the extremely light crowd. However, she still managed to be less than cordial. Barely a smile. Never a \"is there anything else I can get you?\" Dramatic, but asking for ketchup and mustard seemed like a chore.  That being said, the food wasn't bad. It also wasn't amazing. The two burgers amongst our 4 were very solid, but at $10+ for just the burger - we could go to Burgatory and get more for less. The falafel patty was decent, but the lettuce wrap and $1 pineapple were so...stupid is probably the best word. I don't expect much from a lettuce wrap, but it is possible to do it well. One wilted piece of lettuce laid on the bottom and one laid on top does not a lettuce wrap make in my humble opinion. And a few cubes of canned pineapple don't do it either. Burgatory wasn't the end all be all to me until this visit...but I think it is now.",

Now myself is usually an avid fan of the \"build your own burger\" spot in Pittsburgh that I shall not name, but honestly, this place competes for the number 1 burger place in my heart.  Oh yeah!? did I mention the atmosphere and interior of this place is absolutely drop dead gorgeous.  I have already made it a point to make this place a stop on my 21st birthday celebration.  Usually having the wrong order brought out to me would lower my rating, but for here it just raised it that much more because they let me keep the burger and brought out another one.  I legitimately ate two and a half burgers.  Oh yeah, and I had a side and a half of coleslaw.  Let's just say the people I go to eat with do not have as big of stomachs as I do.  Both burgers I had were excellent.  The Market Square's homemade mustard was top notch, and the Shipwreck burger was all around amazing.  Seriously, if you go here, you have got to get the Shipwreck.    Believe me, and believe the city of Pittsburgh: this place is one of the best burger spots in Pittsburgh, and the shipwreck has officially become one of my favorite burgers of all time.",

I do wonder how Winghart's service would be during a busier day, but they seemed to be doing a great job with all of the takeout orders and people at the tables/bar.  The food was simply excellent and the beer/whiskey selection should make most people happy. I got the Shipwrecked Burger and it was seriously awesome! I ordered a medium burger, and they actually cooked it perfectly...while I shouldn't be surprised about that, too many places get a medium wrong. There was so much flavor in the burger, and the toppings on the Shipwrecked (brie, bacon, arugula, caramelized onions, white truffle aioli) just took it over the top for me. The fries are also excellent! Perfectly cooked and lightly seasoned.  My wife ordered the chili and the margherita pizza. Both were very good. Not nearly on par with the burger I ate, but I  would probably order either myself if I ended up at Winghart's and wasn't in the mood for a burger.  Let's just hope this new location can maintain the quality of service and food going forward, as I expect to be there quite a bit now.",

It's got a great happy hour location, but offers no specials or deals to entice us in. It's a shame to see with so many competing restaurants on the block, a huge missed opportunity if you ask me.   All summed up, wingharts is awesome, but bring back the rock that brought the customers in and throw in some happy hour specials, and you've got a 5 star establishment.",

It's really a shame because I loved the beer selection, the specialty burgers, and the daily specials, but after getting the feeling that maybe this place is just meant to be sort of a club for regulars I just spend my money somewhere else.",

    "text": "I first discovered Winghart's in Market Square about six months ago. I almost instantly fell in love with the place (you can ask my jealous girlfriend). From the hand ground burgers with toppings as unique and quirky as the people serving you, a red blooded red meat eater like myself had little to complain about and much to love.  The new Carson Street location is every bit as good as the restaurant in M2 but in very different ways.  The food is spectacular as ever (so good I often question why they are even bothering to ask about the quality) and now you actually have room to eat! The new Winghart's seats approximately 50 at a mixture of industrial chic and hardwood tables and bar. This is a welcome departure from the original that seats about 20 if you squeeze in. The comfortable, relaxed and welcoming atmosphere has made the move as well. Staff are friendly and helpful with Grand Viceroy Shipwreck (actual title and name) still firmly at the helm. The cool punk/folk/altrock music came along for the ride too. I remember hearing everything from Dropkick Murphys to Johnny Cash.   The beer selection is also fantastic. While not quite as expansive as Fat Head's or Blue Dust in Homestead, Winghart's is now sporting about 30 taps as opposed to maybe 10 like Market Square. As always, the whiskey selection is well above par (it is a whiskey bar after all) and all the drinks are reasonably priced as well.   Now on to the main event: the food. Ask anyone who knows me and they will tell you I am not a tiny guy and I love my food. Burgers have always been at the top of my list of loves. A great burger is somhing that is so easy to so and just as easy to screw up. Winghart's has, hand to God, some of the best burgers I have ever had. Period. Owner Zach Winghart cut his teeth working for some of the best chef's in the country (including one of seven U.S. Masters) and brought his passion and skill to the most humble of American staples. The burgers themselves are perfectly seasoned, fresh ground and expertly cooked. I get mine medium rare and they have that perfect juiciness and firmness. Don't forget about the fries while you are there. All orders are done a la carte, but they are well worth it. Winghart's does their fries right: hand-cut and double fried. The double fry is key. It produces a spud that has a wonderfully crispy exterior that guards a creamy and delicious interior. Also, and I realize that this is somewhat of a revelation in Pittsburgh, Winghart's *gasp* SEASONS their fries! I have waited the better part of a year since moving here to find properly cooked and seasoned fries. Sorry Primanti Bros., I do love your sandwiches but your fries suck. For and added treat, order your fries somthered in the house made beer cheese. Your arteries will hate you but your soul will love you.  To sum up, Winghart's will always hold a special place in my heart. From the fun and friendly staff, to the cool, welcoming, and relaxed atmosphere to burgers and fries that are unrivaled in Pittsburgh, Winghart's is a place that must be experienced. The only negative I can find is that Winghart's closes at some point  in the early morning. Come for the burgers, stay for the people, and leave in a cab because of the whiskey.",

The burgers do not come with a side. So I ordered the fries. They weren't very impressive. I ate them because they were there. Pretty salty, and weirdly sweet.   The Southside location a much better experience than the one in Market Square. When we went to the Market Square location we were given warm draft beer, and then ignored. The bartender never bothered to see if we would like to order food. Ignored us when we tried to ask for the check multiple times. She was too busy chatting up her coworkers. Awful. We ended up leaving and eating somewhere else.   The four stars is for the Southside location. Staff was friendly, it wasn't to crowded. 30 beers on tap. I definitely recommend trying their burgers.",

    "text": "Tried to go here once and will never go back.  Went out to dinner with my dad on a weekday night while he was in town.  He was in the mood for a hamburger and I had heard from friends that this was the place to go.  Being new to South Side, I took their advice.  When we walked in, there were about 5 people at the bar (again it was a Tuesday night).  The bartender behind the bar looked up, made eye contact, then turned and walked to the other end of the bar (towards the back of the restaurant).  Waited another minute or two - didn't know if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated, as there was no sign nor direction given by staff.  After another minute or two, this bartender/waitress yelled from behind the bar that we could sit wherever we would like.  So we chose a table for two not too far from the bar and proceeded to wait - no menus, no drinks, etc.  The whole time we sat, I could see the staff who were working and what they were doing and made eye contact more than once with them.  The bartenders/waitresses stood behind the bar and chatted with the customers sitting at the bar.  There were two girls behind the bar, both doing nothing but standing around and talking to one another and to the other patrons and another girl who was sitting at a table in the back doing some sort of paperwork.  15 minutes later, no one had come over to even give us a menu, so we walked out.  I will never even consider trying this place again after such a horrible experience.",

Maybe without the apostrophe?  I realize we can have a bad experience even at a good place, but really?  1 star?  I'm scratching my head.    Winghart's may be the best burger joint Pittsburgh has to offer.  The burger itself is on par with Benjamin's in the North Side, arguably better.  The bartender was cool and unassuming.  Their fine selection of bourbons, scotch, canadian and irish whiskies, and craft beers is a bonus.  Oh, and the fries were pretty awesome too.  This place has raised the bar and set the standard for the growing burger trend.  Now i just need to check out the one in Market Sq and decide which is the best Winghart's.",

The man at the bar (looked like he was the only one working) saw us, but didn't say anything.  We decided to give him a few minutes to finish whatever he was doing.  Well, after five minutes, he never came over to take our order.  There were two people in the entire place, so no excuses.

The atmosphere was nice though..modern, clean, hip. It's definitely a bar first, restaurant second, all high top tables, not very comfortable, but that's not a complaint, just preference.  Food: pizza, wings, burgers..but website indicates they are bar foods well made, main dish quality..they were not. Margarita pizza was burnt, black bottom with barley melted cheese, soggy. .decent flavor, but the cook needs a lesson..the wings were just 'eh' take out pizza spot quality, 8 overcook dry wings for 13.50$ AND you have to pay extra for ranch or blue cheese dressing/not worth price at all!! Salad came out with main dish, pop was flat..asked cook for plates for the pizza and he said it wasn't his job to get them.. (could he not have just asked whoever job it was?!) So all that adds up to blah experience and I wouldn't try again.  Do think potential is there, but service needs improved and cooks need trained..seems good quality ingredients wasted.",

    "text": "Ok so here's the deal.  Given that you guys are consistently rated as one of the better burgers in Pittsburgh I challenge you to actually cook me a burger that is decent in the slightest.  Prove me wrong and I'll take it all back.  Before totally bashing your burger I will say your wings were tasty.  Good sauce, well cooked, not too big and not too small and crispy.  ...and the fries were top notch.  My girlfriend had a salad.  It looked great and she enjoyed it.  So for your wings, salad and fries you got two stars instead of one.  Being on a quest to sample the most touted burgers in the burgh I knew I had to get to Winghart's at some point.  They make many of the \"Best Burgers in the Burgh\" lists floating around the internet so they had been on my radar for a couple years.  Finally made it in last night before hitting a show at Club Cafe.  I created my own burger and kept it simple... Gruyere, onions and pickle.  Final verdict... TERRIBLE!  Seriously the worst burger in the city and really anywhere I've ever eaten.  You could beat this abomination with an unseasoned frozen 50% soy Walmart patty and a generic bun.  It was actually so tasteless and off putting that I thought for sure it had to be a fluke.  I would have written it off as me being the unfortunate recipient of their \"one bad burger in years hey everyone makes mistakes burger\" but my buddy who had ordered the dock worker had the same sentiments.  In a sample size of two... two out of two were so bad we were still talking about it this morning.  Burger was totally lacking any trace of beef flavor and had a really weird mushy texture.  It was cold.  The only flavor present was this like fake char / lighter fluid type flavor... like the burger was sprayed with canned fake charbroil scent from an aerosol can... if that even exists.  The cheese wasn't melted.  I never even got to the pickles as I gave up after five or six bites around the edges.  The flavor was so off that we actually said no amount of salt and spice could have saved it.  Winghart's if you're looking for rock bottom on the spectrum of burger flavor and texture... you have succeeded.  Congratulations.  On top of all this the bartender was not attentive.  It was a Monday night.  5-6 people at the bar and that included our party of three.  He could have easily served us another beer and probably the whisky we were contemplating had he been more interested in serving and less interested in leaning at the other end of the bar chirping about how slow of a night they were having.      As a disclaimer I'm not a picky eater and am usually very understanding when it comes to food and food service.  I cook a lot and know that things don't always come out perfect and I do appreciate how hard it is to compete and maintain consistency.  Unfortunately this was just an absolutely terrible excuse for a sandwich.  I'd love to know how much you paid all these critics to get on their lists!?",

As I ignoring him forcing himself trying to stuff that dried and burnt whole wheat like Sweet Georgia Brown Wood Fired Pizza ($9.75) down his throat with a glass of water .. I just want to say you deserved that!  My Shipwreck Burger ($12) is just so so good!! My medium rare cooked patty is topped with brie cheese, caramelized onions with bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli. Yes it is juicy.. it is cooked perfectly and it is worth every penny!  Sucker you! Stop looking at MY burger.. and stop asking me to help you eat your pizza... I rather have another pint of my kick ass Thirsty dog Siberian Night Stout with 9.6% ABV! Trust me.. you don't want to mess with me after I have one of those!   Super friendly service!!   I will be back!! As there are 30 different drafts on tap... and I have not even start on the whiskey.. Maybe I should have order the WHISKEY! It is call a whiskey bar.. Fail!!",

    "text": "I present to you the brand spankin' new South Side Winghart's!  That sounded like it's my place, right?  It's not... but it IS my jam!  I will not mess around with this review.  Winghart's is still thee best burger in the Burgh!  Their meat is fresh and you can tell.  Their fries are spectacularly crispy and delicious.  But the new digs...  Gorgeous!  Just what the Market Square Winghart's so direly needed... SPACE!  It's huge inside with seating for what I suspect has to be around 80 people, along with a very long bar.  The beer offerings look to be even more wide and varied than the M2 location as well.  I do wish they would have kept Arsenal Cider on tap here, but I assume they rotate out, so hopefully it will be back!  One thing I will note that I like about the M2 location is that it's fun to sit right in front of the grill.  I like the cooks and staff at that location and it's fun to chat with them while they cook and see the \"process.\"  I do miss that, but jeez, the SPACE South Side allows will be amazing for that crowd.    I did hear a little secret on why their fries are crispy amazingness.  I guess they fry them twice in peanut oil.  And my secret, they have some fancy schmancy burgers (The Shipwreck is hard to avoid) but I keep it real with just a good old fashion cheddar burger because I actually want to TASTE the burger!    So go here my friends and be merry and eat lots of meat!  Oh, their pizza's are bomb too:)",

So when dinner time rolled around and I had an hour to kill in the South Side before a show I choose Wingharts on Carson for my dinner choice.   Service was spot on and my Market Square burger was awesome. Couldn't say so much for the fries that I added on for an extra $3.00 (one would think that a burger costing $9.50 would already come with fries...  Not here). The fries were mostly overdone and in peices.    I think for a burger it's a bit pricey for what you get but they do have a good beer selection, good service and tasty burgers.  Not a place I'd recommend over the other choices on the South Side but not a place to avoid either.",

The fries were good but greatly over-salted. And this comes from a salt lover. I told the bar tender and his reply was \"fries are supposed to be salty\". I should have sent them back. It could have been a one time accident but my suggestion is to order them unsalted and then salt to taste. Overall a good place.",

I made sure they made their own buffalo sauce instead of just use Frank's or something. They did make their own. And uh... it wasn't great. Smelled really strongly of vinegar when it came out, but unfortunately it was SO mild.  No tang, no spice, and lacking in plain old salt.  I'll be nice and +1 star for the ephemere cherry I had. I'm not a big beer person, but my friend said i might like it, and it was probably my favorite beer I've tried ever. Straight up fruity with a very refreshing finish. It's probably not for everyone, but it was for me.   Interesting selection of rareish beer(s) might make me come back. The decor and vibe is a bit generic, but it's fine. However, shitty wing sauce with my beer is a definitely big strike in my book :/",

I mean, that pretty much sums up all that needs to be said about Wingharts. The south side location has that dark, south side bar type feel to it - exposed  brick and dark wood tables - nice beer selection.  The 'Market Square Burger' was a great choice - bacon, mushrooms and gruyere, a winning combo - and cooked to perfection. The meat itself was juicy and flavorful - yum. Fries come a la carte and one order is enough for two or three people - seasoned and crispy good! The pepperoni roll app was great - the spinach and artichoke dip, not so great.  Went with a party of five - it did take some time for the burgers to come out, but it was well worth the wait.  Heard they have great pizza, too - can't wait to try it! Maybe I'll visit the Market Square location next. :-)",

This was not as good as that location, but it still lived up to the Winghart's name:  delicious wings, burgers, and especially the fries.  The menu had all of the weird but funny names for the items.  I ordered buffalo wings, a basket of fries, and the dockworker burger. The wings were fantastic.  The blend of sweet and spicy in the buffalo sauce was perfect.  The wings were thick and juicy, with a light crisp as the cherry on top.  The fries were amazing.  I didn't need to dip them in a sauce because they tasted amazing already.  If there was one item that I would get at winghart's, it would be those fries.  Finally, the dockworker burger.  It was grilled to a medium well perfectly.  The fries were amazing because their wing Hart's fries.  The cole slaw was okay.  It is one of the reasons why I'm giving this 4 stars.  It really didn't have the flavor that slaw normally had and it didn't have that crunch either.  But the burger was solid.  The bathroom was hideous though.  It looked like a sewer underneath a dungeon.  Also, one of the waitresses was just lazy and didn't seem liked she cared at all.   But all in all, a great and delicious location that you should check out if you are in the south side of Pittsburgh.",

Winghart's burgers are very good (Market Square).   The burgers here are the same.  I normally would take a picture of the food - but my camera was not fast enough ;-)  I tried two new beers they had on tap.   Enjoyed my time there.  A strong recommendation!",

    "text": "In the past this review would have been higher - after this weekend, I'm going to average it out with a 3 rating. They upgraded the decor in the place, so it has a nice atmosphere and occasionally a good happy hour find!  Recently, I had friends in from out of town who have joined me there before and loved the burgers so it was our first choice for dinner. Upon arriving we noticed that the bartender was the only employee we had seen (they have roughly 8 - 10 tables in the place). I sympathize as I've been a server in an understaffed place... but, he didn't make an effort to actually serve us at all. We had to ask for drinks and stop him as he rushed away in order to put in our dinner order.... and with that he seemed annoyed.  Sadly, my punjabi mac & cheese was cold by the time they brought it with the other burgers. I had to again flag him down to ask for it to be heated. When it came back out it was warmer but didn't have much flavor. The report on the burgers: they were ok, but not as good as in the past.  I'm not ruling out returning to the E. Carson location - but it won't be anytime soon... and I'll be sure to see how many people are working (and if it was that unfriendly man) before I actually sit down next time.",

    "text": "I am disappointed to say I wasn't blown away by wingharts.. Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but I overall felt it was pretty average and nothing that I want to hurry back to.   We went on a Sunday evening, it was pretty quiet there compared to a lot of the surrounding bars in the area (which I liked). The place is gorgeous, I have to say that. The unique abstract table tops and the painting around the door on the outside was all done by hand (I watched the guy paint some of it a couple months ago). It's dark, but comfortable at the bar and it's an overall chill atmosphere.   My boyfriend ordered a burger, I ordered a falafel sandwich as well as a BBQ chicken pizza to share. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger and was happy that \"it didn't fall apart at all\" but it didn't blow him away. My falafel sandwich was good but again, nothing fantastic and not something that I would order again. They are known for their brick oven pizzas so I had high expectations. The BBQ chicken pizza was good- thin, crispy crust and topped with Caramelized onions, chicken, sweet BBQ sauce and cheddar cheese. The BBQ sauce was a little overwhelming and took away the flavors of the onions, cheddar cheese and chicken though.   Their draft list wasn't bad at all, they have a pretty large selection of craft beers!   It was an overall enjoyable dinner, but nothing noteworthy. I would like to return to try their wings, but I won't rush back.",

The bar tender who also served us was very pleasant and helpful. While she did forget the french fries that were supposed to accompany my husband's meal, she did quickly get them out to him. I had a side salad which was fine but I think that is hard to mess up. The Lucy's pierogi's were tasty and I would get them again. I think the menu was misleading with the two other items I tried. First, the whiskey and cheddar Mac n cheese tasted like Alfredo from a jar only it tasted worse than that. My sister in law got a pizza which was supposed to have fresh mozzarella but it was definitely just regular pizza cheese. The sauce was sweeter than expected for pizza and was also greasier than I prefer.   I personally wouldn't suggest going here but I suspect I may not have ordered their best dishes and would be to give it another try in the future.",

    "text": "I stopped by this Winghart's with a couple of friends this past Sun. at around 6:30.  Having visited and enjoyed the original location in Market Square, and having a City Dining Card, I suggested that we stop by.  Since it'd been awhile since my friends had had a good burger, they were game, so we ventured over to E. Carson St. to check it out.  As an appetizer, we ordered the white truffle aioli fries ($5.25) to share between us.  These fries were well-fried and crispy, and the toppings were delicious, taking the fries to another level.  As my entree, I decided to go with the French mac and cheese ($12.50), since I'd never tried Boursin cheese before.  This dish, which is listed as an appetizer, also included crimini mushrooms and bacon, and turned out to be more than large enough for me as an entree.  I really enjoyed its flavor, which was creamy and complemented well by savory notes from the bacon and mushrooms.  My friends ordered the shipwreck ($10.50) and Market Square ($11) burgers.  They enjoyed them, but I can't comment on them because I didn't try them due to not eating beef.  Our visit initially got off to an awkward start when nobody greeted us when upon arrival--we had to approach the bar to get seated, and menus weren't brought over for another ~10 min.  However, once our waiter became aware of our presence, all went smoothly.  The atmosphere is very bar-like, similar to the Market Square location.  While good quality, esp. for a bar, I find the food to be a tad overpriced--fortunately, though, I had a City Dining Card, which knocked $10 off of our check.  Overall, this Winghart's is pretty comparable to the one downtown, so if you enjoy that one, you should enjoy this one as well.",

I like more of a laid back, relaxed atmosphere and Winghart's fits that bill. The bartenders are all good people and I've always had a great experience with everyone working there.   The bar and shelves are lined with tons of Whiskey, obviously and just about anything else you could want. They have a nice selection of craft beers that are great and even amazing mixed cocktails with fresh ingredients made on the spot. The food there is also pretty great.. they are known for their burgers and the truffle fries are delicious as well.  During the day and week days the bar doesn't seem to fill up too much, which is expected. On weekends it draws a crowd and has a more upbeat atmosphere. They have a jukebox that anyone can play which is always appreciated.",

    "text": "This review is strictly based on my happy hour experience. I would still go back to see if it's better for lunch or dinner.   After meeting my buddy at the Tuesday South Side farmers market, we wanted to check out a new happy hour place. I'm always on the hunt for that perfect after work spot for a quickie drink and snack.   On paper, I really loved the menu at Winghart's. It had a uniquely Pittsburgh flair with their fresh made pierogies and funnel cake offerings. And, with a reputation for good whiskey and burgers, how can you go wrong?!?  With bad customer service, I tell ya.   My buddy and I picked a table off the bar side so we could relax and catch up with each other. After waiting 8-12? minutes for someone to take our drink order (happy hour minutes are more precious and finite after all) we moved our set up to the bar, just as it seemed the bartender was heading over to see us. I guess there is no service person working the floor then. The one service person we thought was working the floor was actually a nice dude sitting at the bar who felt sorry for us and had come over to give us his food menu (?)  Even once we settled at the bar, it seemed to take an unusually long period of time to get our drink and food order. Having worked at restaurants during and after college as a service person and bartender at some pretty cool places, I have an idea of what makes things work for good customer experience, and I'm sorry, it takes more than a cute bartender with short shorts for this girl.   My buddy sat with an empty wine glass waiting to order a second, and the bartender delivered my water, but forgot to make my Jameson and ginger until I asked where it was, delivered one order of boneless wings but our 2nd food order never showed up! I had to toast my buddy with my glass of water :((  After having an \"unhappy\" hour, we gave up and asked for our check to leave. Sadly, we even had to wait to do that. Seriously, if the bar looked crazy busy with people, I would have understood much better, but it looked like a manageable crowd that a better bartender/service person could handle with one hand tied behind their back.   But that menu though .....  Get it together Winghart's!  As I sat waiting for my orders scrolling thru many yelp reviews for food and drink recommendations, I found that my bad customer experience was not unique to me.   Ps, our boneless tikka masala wings were saucy, yet crispy and delicious.",

I enjoyed the cajun fries but it was just a tad bit on the salty side.

When we arrived, the place in general gave us a weird vibe, but we wanted to give the place the benefit of the doubt (and use our gift certificate of course). There were two girls working at the bar who were also the waitresses. They were extremely unprofessional the entire time talking about their lives instead of checking on their tables. We got our food- wings, a burger, and fries- from the chef who was very nice! The burger was good and the fries were as well, but the buffalo wings were not. They were very rubbery, and the buffalo sauce was very creamy. We are our meal and I asked the bartender for our check and gave her our gift certificate. Long story short: they accused of us using the certificate previously. I told her we didn't and have never been to the south side location, but she insisted that we did. She told us she was doing us a favor and would deduct the $25 today, but she was keeping our name on \"file,\" so if we tried to pull this again we would get in trouble. We then paid our bill and left as quickly as possible.   Side Note: The bartenders wanted us to go up to the bar every time we needed something so they didn't have to walk around to our table.   What a terrible experience for our date night!",

Their five dollar Moscow miles are wonderful! You must try their truffle aioli fries; they're my late night favorite.   The only reason that it gets four stars is because the service can be hit or miss.   If you're looking for cheap drinks and lots of people to mingle with this place isn't the right spot.

It started with a half price coupon and boy did that pay off... a definite return spot!",

While it was hard to get my food and drinks (the bartenders charged me and then just forgot until I reminded them), I think that was more a result of the bar crawl rush than the everyday quality of service. With that being said, I had Cajun French fries and Mac n cheese, and both were VERY good! I love some quality bar food and they definitely have it. I've been thinking about that Mac n cheese all week - I can't wait to come back on a more normal afternoon.",

First they were out of half their draft list. What they did have left on tap was all awful..so we both settled on a founders all day IPA.. They were not cold. As a last ditch effort we sent them back for 2 Miller lite bottles..so that tells you how bad of a beer selection we were working with. The girl spent half the time petting her friends dog and then cleaning up when he peed on the floor and never washed her hands ONCE  When my \"medium\" burger came out it was practically raw. I ate a couple bites and had to stop because I just couldn't do it. I've never had a particularly great experience at this location but I will never be back.",

Pierogis are apparently fresh made daily.  I would t say they were exponentially different/better but they were good.    Pizza dough is made in house and was very tasty.  We got the margarita pizza and the breakfast pizza.  Their fries are perfect! Fresh cut and deliciously crispy.  Very well flavored and work so well with their ranch.   The burgers are what they are known for and are very good.  Not the best burger ever and a little overpriced, but still above average.  Good quality and unique flavor combinations.  We got the shipwreck which was good but a little rich and the Hawaiian style burger that was very good!  Will definitely be back!!",

We started out with an order of craft beer which there selection was far from the amount some places have on tap but it was very well in the sense of the amount of beer they had to accommodate craft beer lovers.  Started out with an order of the Sweet Jame-0 wings which were very meaty, fried lightly not overly cooked, crispy. The sauce was that of sweet nothing spicy just sweet.   Burger time. Went with the \"Shipwreck\" Now when I picture a shipwreck of a burger it invokes double and triple patties, tons of bacon, cheese by the layers just a heart wrenching gut busting burger but this was far from that this was what I call a nice gourmet burger that was well balanced, cooked medium and had a great amount of taste to it with no dryness. I always try a piece of burger meat separate to get a good feel for the quality and it was up to par.   Location is on Carson St which at times can be a pain to find parking depending on the day you go but it was quiet so that wasn't an issue. Service was great and attentive. Prices seemed reasonable. I would def return to this location and try the Downtown also. 4 out of 5 all day.",

I'm a beer guy, and it was nice to see an extensive draft list with a variety of different choices. My girlfriend likes cocktails and she had a kiwi cocktail. Usually she is quite picky, but she loved the fresh fruit mixed into her sweet drink.   Food was nicely timed, appetizers came out in a timely manner, food followed shortly behind. We had the fried cauliflower and brussel sprouts as an appetizer which both were very good. She had the cod sandwich, topped with fresh lettuce tomato and onion, I had the market square burger, cooked perfectly medium. The fries are the main reason I will be coming back. Crisp, topped with cajun seasoning.  The bartender was very welcoming and our drinks were never empty even though there was quite a few tables and a few bar guests. Very good service, great food, better drinks. It's a quiet getaway from the busy night life in the south side. We will definitely be back!!",

We grabbed a couple beers at the bar.  It's a pretty long bar going front to back with tables before and after it.  There are plenty of tvs, but it seems more of a hipster bar than a sports bar.  The food sounded pretty good from the menu, so I ordered a chicken sandwich and the beer cheese fries.    The sandwich was ok, it was the Pretty Good Chicken Sandwich with the chicken breast.  It's your basic sandwich with greens, onions, tomatoes, provolone and a red pepper aioli.  It's served on a regular burger bun.  The beer cheese fries were nothing special.  The beer cheese was bland and the fries were like salt bombs.  The bartender was very attentive though and kept our drinks filled.",

When the entrees arrived, I asked if the kitchen wasn't making chicken dip today. The bartender apologized for her mistake of not entering the dip and said she'd comp our drinks. I had to wait approx. 5 min before my salad dressing showed up. The food is good but the service is so awful that we will not return. Our bill was a little expensive so I asked for an itemized version and saw that she had not comped our drinks.  I also never got the lemon for my water.",

    "text": "Journeyed here for a weekday lunch. Found it to be very welcoming, though a bit on the chilly side for me.  We were greeted immediately by the bartender who gave us menus and some time to peruse.  When he returned, he took our whole order, including appetizer, drinks, and entrees by memory. A few minutes later, he came back to refresh his memory.  Pen and paper are still ok to use, people.  Wings: Whiskey BBQ sauce was really salty and did not come close to the BBQ sauce at locations like Mad Mex. They were prepared correctly, however. We will just try a different sauce next time.  Burgers: I ordered the special \"Kumar\" burger, which came topped with tikka Mac and cheese and fried onions. I ordered it med. rare, but it came prepared just beyond medium. My husband's was the same. The flavor of the tikka Mac wasn't enough for the burger to stand alone. It needed something else. My suggestion? Ditch the fried onions and replace with grilled veggies!  Fries with beer cheese: Perfect. So perfect.   Service: Ok, I like to meet people, and perhaps this is what most people want, but the bartender was very extroverted. Again, I don't think this is a bad thing, but I learned a LOT about him in just a short sitting. He was really nice, just maybe a little too much sharing for me.   Experience: Overall, pretty good. We've had better there, though.",

    "text": "Winghart's has been on my to-try list since the Market Square location opened. When I started working in the South Side, I was thrilled to discover this new location, and I finally got to try it last night.  The atmosphere was pretty great; casual and not too crowded. The tables are still really close together (not having been to the M2 location, I can't compare) at the front, where the smaller tables for two are located. The larger tables at the back have a bit more space. It's seat yourself when you walk in; we arrived around 5:15pm on a Friday and there were plenty of seats available. Just FYI: The very first table next to the front door has an AC vent pointed right at it; great if you're hot, not if you don't want a cool breeze on ya! The music is pretty loud, but not so loud we couldn't talk... and it IS a bar, so. Plus, the tunes were good (Bowie!), so I wasn't complaining.  Our server was extremely friendly and checked in right away as I waited for my friend to arrive. I ordered an Ace Pear Cider on draft, which really hit the spot. My friend is super picky about drinks and doesn't want her alcohol to taste like alcohol, so the server helped her find something she'd like. Initially my friend ordered an Amaretto and Coke, but they didn't have amaretto. Before we left, they went and got a bottle so she was able to have the drink she wanted. Pretty impressive, IMO.  We were really there for the food, though. I love a good burger and I couldn't wait to try the Shipwrecked Burger. I ordered mine medium rare, as I always do. My friend got the Tallulah Hula Burger, no onions, medium well (I know). When the burgers arrived, mine was much closer to medium, which may have been a result of waiting around for my friend's medium well. My friend noted that there was some onion residue on her burger (she's really sensitive to the taste) and thinks they may have initially put them on and then scraped them off.  My burger was good, but not omg great. My expectations may have been too high, but it was just... a good burger. The white truffle aioli came through and was delicious; however, the whole thing was really, really salty. And I drink pickle brine, so when I say it was salty, I mean it. The beef flavor didn't really come through. Yes, I know I ordered a burger with a ton of toppings, but at e.g. Tessaro's, even with 900 things on the burger, you can still taste the beef really well.  The fries, to me, were overcooked -- really brown and a little dry, and again, super salty. They did have an intriguing sweetness to them; I'm not sure if it was a brine they were soaked in or just the contrast of potato flavor against all the salt. Didn't love them.  Overall, I'd give the food three stars, and that made me a bit sad. Tessaro's is, IMO, still the best burger in the 'burgh, and I like Burgatory better, too. But the service was definitely five-star, and the atmosphere was nice, hence the overall four-star rating. I didn't try my friend's burger but she ate it all, so she must've liked it fine (after she picked off the remaining onion bits).  I'll go back, because it's convenient to work and it was so nice and relaxed. I'll have another burger, too, since I don't want to render a final judgement based on just one visit.",

I'm one of those froo-froo nancy ladies that eats the burger without the bun, so I really got to experience THE BURGER in its unadulterated deliciousness.  It was... sogood.  Moist, flavorful, toppings were not overpowering (I did the mushroom one with the mustard sauce), and just all-around damn good.  As Rachel C said, the secret to the fries is double frying.  Here's another secret.  Share with a friend.  Seriously, they bring you so many fries.  ...or maybe don't share with a friend (LAY OFF ME, I'M STARVING).  I also like that they organize their beers on tap in order from light to dark, no guesswork, and they are happy to let you try out a sip of something before you commit to a whole glass, which is awesome.

I was expecting more flavors from all the amazing toppings, but I think they were shadowed by the burnt outside of the patty. The fresh cut fries were some of the best I've ever had anywhere.  One big complaint is that they only give you enough pita wedges for half of the buffalo dip. She came by when we were finishing one of the last ones, and said, \"Would you like more pita? It's $1.99\". So they knowingly do this just to get an extra $2 out of you. For this reason, I'm dropping them to 2 stars. It's just a really shady business practice.",

    "text": "Holy moley. A friend and I decided to come here on a whim after seeing the Book of Mormon. Being around 11pm, it was pretty late for Pittsburgh, and we didn't feel like paying an arm and a leg to go eat at some of the nicer (but still super delicious!) places Downtown. Deciding to try Winghart's was one of my best decisions ever.  I saw on my Yelp app that this place has decent reviews, but now I know they don't fully encapsulate the awesomeness of this place. We walked in and asked to sit to eat, and even though they were considering closing the kitchen early, they fired everything up for us as needed, with zero resentment and constant friendliness.  We sat at a bar open to the grill area, so we watched all of our food being made in front of us. The fries were unbelievable, and my burger was cooked to True medium-rare perfection. It was actually a little rarer than I would normally order it most other places, but the meat was such melt-in-your-mouth quality goodness that I had no qualms and just chowed down. My friend's \"burger\" was a chicken sausage patty, and it was also fantastic (but obviously fully-cooked).  (Almost) Even better than the food were the people there. Our cook was a huge yinzer, and told some pretty entertaining stories as we ate. Definitely not for kids, but I don't know why you'd be out with your kids at 11pm on a Wednesday.  This is the kind of place where I feel like you'd always wind up in conversation with someone, be it the people who work there or the guy eating a burger next to you at the bar. Winghart's makes me want to hang out in Downtown more, since I know I'll have an awesome meal waiting for me at some point during the night.",

    "text": "Winghart's is totally the cat's pajamas!  So many friends have told me to check out Winghart's, but seeing as I'm rarely ever downtown in Market Square, I knew it would've taken me quite a while. That being said, the minute I heard about them opening a location in the Southside, I was ecstatic. I was a bit apprehensive at first, seeing as a) I'm not big on burgers (veg-head here!) and b) even one swig of whiskey can make this lightweight ill! Given that, I was still mega impressed by everything they had to offer.  I went with pizza and got \"The Boomer\" (sounds like a real winner with a name like that, right?) sans bacon. It was a white pizza with mushroom, brie (OMGIWANTALLTHEBRIE), caramelized onions, arugula, and truffle aioli (OMGTRUFFLE). It. was. amazing. I felt a bit decadent getting a brie and truffle pizza, so readers/eaters (reaters) beware! It may be too rich to handle for one person. Admittedly, seeing as I'm an unapologetic glutton, I ate the entire thing. Goodbye, arteries!  Their beer selection here is also on point. Not only do they have a huge variety, they had my absolute favorite cider, Crispin! I was pleasantly surprised, since the only other place I've seen it in Pittsburgh is at Belvedere's in LoLa. Prices here are fair too, especially given the quality and quantity of what you get. Do your tastebuds a favor and check out Winghart's!",

Being as such there is not a plethora of seating, but my party had no problem getting a small table when we showed up Wednesday night.  As I looked at the menu I realized that I had to go for their namesake, so I ordered a Denny Double Bleu Burger, an order of fries, and a Bushmill's on the rocks.  The staff was friendly and accommodating, but the food took a little time to come out from when we ordered.  Oh, but when it did come out I dug in and it was delicious.  The burger was cooked exactly to order, juicy and tender.  The bleu cheese dressing with the crumbles was bleu cheese overkill.  Just the way I like it.  The fries were some of the best fries I've ever had.  They were crispy, yet big enough to have some substance and were seasoned very well.  The only thing I can complain about is the bun.  Don't get me wrong, it's an adequate bun, but it's more bread-like than bun-like.  It has a light and airy texture and I like my burger buns to be a little denser.  All in all, Winghart's was a great little bar to go to for a burger and whiskey and I think that might be what they were going for.",

That early in the night there was plenty of street parking and we were able to get a large table in the back of the bar.  They have $4 draft happy hour specials and a great list to choose from. I tired a beer I had never had before-a cherry ale that was delicious.  They also had $1.50 PBR pounders which my date went with-could not pass up the great deal! The one thing they do not have is wine-a member of our party tried to order wine and they only have one kind from a box. Well of course this is a whiskey bar so I would expect nothing less!  They have a really unique menu with funnel cake appetizers. We went with the regular one with powder sugar but they also had one you could try with cheese and bacon-not sure if I would like that. We also ordered a pizza that was delicious-it had pineapple and barbeque sauce.  The pita and buffalo chicken dip was another great appetizer I recommend.  The burgers were a bit pricey but heard they are the best in the burgh.  Our friends tried them out and they sure did look tasty!",

While I have had some awesome burgers at other restaurants around the city that don't necessarily specialize in burgers (Tessaro's in Bloomfield, Remedy in Lawrenceville, and Six Penn in the Cultural District- try them all!), Winghart's is definitely the winner among those that claim fame in burger making.  My boyfriend and I came to the South Side location after a botched attempt to go to the Market Square one which is currently under renovations and I am so happy we made the extra little jaunt to the South Side instead of letting our hungry stomachs take us astray somewhere else downtown.  I tried the Shipwreck burger after reading many of the previous reviews on here and it did not disappoint! Gooey brie all mixed up with caramelized onions, bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli (hooray for fancy mayo!) to compliment a GIANT beef patty on the perfect bun.  I was honestly so preoccupied with my own massive feast that I don't remember what exactly my boyfriend got but i tried a bite of it and it was cheesy, delicious, and spicy.    Pro's:  - Awesome creative burger combinations served in a plastic wrapper to keep it all from becoming a giant mess while you eat it - Great fries to boot (a necessary combo with any burger) - Great draft and liquor selection - Friendly staff  Con's: - Place was not crowded and took a LONG time for our food to come out - Ordered my burger medium and it came out well-done (saved because it was still juicy, but I like my cows still mooing! Will have to remember to opt for medium rare next time) - Tables at the front of the restaurant are not good for eating they are super skinny and long... and there are not many tables in the back.  We sat at the bar which was fine because it was not crowded on a Wednesday night but could have been annoying on a busier weekend",

    "text": "Apparently, this Winghart's location recently went through some renovations. It's really nifty and cool inside. My father was marveling about how many different kinds of lightbulb swerve hanging from the ceiling. Our server was really friendly and attentive (partly because it was a slow Sunday early afternoon.) He was conversational and made sure we were well taken care of. We ordered the Shipwrecked Burger, the Market Square Burger, and the Tika Masala wings. Along with that we got the white truffle aoli fires and the mojo fries. Everything was ridiculously amazing. You can taste how fresh the beef is, since it is apparently ground fresh daily and never frozen. I do not live in PA, but if I were to return, I will certainly make an effort to stop in here again!",

    "text": "Went in there this evening for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. Samantha waited on us and it was truly one of the best service experiences I've ever had. She was so sweet and helpful. We had wings, the buffalo chicken pizza, and the shipwreck'd burger. Food was great, nice draft menu, and again amazing service. Also, I really enjoyed the music. Nice array of pop and punk music. Will be going back again. Please check it out!",

    "text": "Awesome is the first word that comes to mind after eating here. Got the pierogi burger and truffle aioli fries, and both were incredible. Knowledgeable and friendly bartenders. I work in the industry, so far too often I find myself listening to the staff trying to bullshit their way through stuff they dont know about, but both the male and female bartender knew their stuff. I went on a Monday night and the place was almost empty. I'll be back again real soon.",

    "text": "Winghart's was one of my Pittsburgh bookmarks when I got into town last week, but I wasn't sure if I'd make it there or not. Fortunately, thanks to Ken M persuading me to \"take one for the team\" and check it out, I was re-inspired to make a stop. Let's just say, it was one of the best decisions of my week. Having not eaten lunch, I stopped by mid-afternoon with a big appetite, craving for one their great burgers I keep reading about. The first thing I learned is this is their second location, on the South Side. The original spot is located across the river downtown.    As mentioned before, I knew I wanted a burger, but looked at the menu...well, card, of selections anyway. They don't mess around here; you're either getting a burger, a pizza or salad. There are about six variations of each or you can create your own. I eyed the \"Mattola Burger\" which is described as \"two 1/2 lb. beef patties with applewood smoked bacon and American cheese.\" Two 1/2 patties? Wow! I was hungry, but didn't necessarily have a death wish. Thankfully, you can order a \"half\" variety and I went with that.   I also ordered a pint of Dark Horse Fore Smoked Stout, but didn't get any sides (extra) thinking the burger itself would be good enough. Wow, was it ever! The medium cooked burger, made from fresh ground beef, was large, juicy and delicious. Plus, the bacon was actually cut up into small pieces and grilled with the cheese.   Just thinking about it again it making me hungry! I envy the Duke here.",

    "text": "This is more 2.5 stars than 3, but I was feeling generous. The burger was good, but overly greasy. Yes - I do enjoy a juicy burger, but greasy and juicy are not the same. The toasted bun was perfect, as it was able to hold up to the burger and toppings.   The fries were entirely too salty. I had a few, but couldn't eat too many because of the excessive amount of salt. There is something else on the fries, too....they tasted a little sweet.   I did appreciate how they chopped up the pickles, getting some in each bite. The service was friendly and quick. Good place in a pinch, but I've had better burgers.",
