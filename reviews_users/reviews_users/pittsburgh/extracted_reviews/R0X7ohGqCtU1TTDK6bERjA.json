A $4 'upcharge' for asparagus?  And ...a 'charge' to split a wedge salad?   ...a little disappointing....sorry to say, but will think twice about picking this one again in the near future",

For lunch I had the mac and cheese with smoked chicken and bacon; it was wonderful!! The portion was just the right size and I was able to finish my lunch without feeling overly stuffed. For dessert, they had two different types of cupcakes, yellow cake or red velvet. I love all things red velvet and am very picky, and this cupcake certainly lived up to my expectations! The cupcake itself was moist and the icing was light and creamy without being over sweet. I would love to go back here to eat lunch and check out the rest of their menu.",

Gnocchi was fluffy and tasty, and was flavored with a little bit of bacon.  The fish sandwich, salmon, mahi with crab were all good.  All together, it was a very good time.  The only downsides were that the portions were a bit on the small side for the price, and service could have been a little bit better.  Our waitress was friendly and pleasant, but I didn't see her much during our meal.  I would definitely come back, though, as the overall experience was quite good.",

I would suggest people steer clear of this place.  Terrible, slow service and the tofu is horrible (added to salad).  The kid's grilled cheese was hard/tough and not melty.  How do you mess up a grilled cheese?  The BLT wrap (special) was not too bad.  We didn't receive silverware until almost 8 minutes after our food was placed on the table.  They didn't bring the fruit cup out prior to our meal like  we had asked (for our toddler) -- she was STARVING and a total crab-ass, but they just didn't do it.",

    "text": "After seeing this reviewed in so many other places I am surprised that it hasn't been written up on yelp yet.  After reading so many of those great reviews I am thoroughly disappointed in the food and service that my family and I received at the Hartwood Restaurant. We ate lunch on a Saturday afternoon in October. The place was not that busy and we were promptly seated. I don't know if it was because of all the dust in the air and on the bookshelves around us but my husband immediately began having an allergic reaction to something. After a few minutes the worst of it subsided but his eyes remained quite red and watery for the remainder of the meal.  We all ordered our meals and drinks at the same time. I ordered a Pepsi and as soon as I took a drink had to spit it out. The syrup in the machine must have been low and it tasted like bland carbonated water. I asked the waitress to get me a new one and she looked at me like I was crazy but went and got one anyways. She must have got it from the same machine though and the second one was just as bad. Figuring that since a decent glass of Pepsi was too much to ask I wasn't expecting much from the meal.  I ordered an Angus Cheeseburger and fries. My husband ordered the Beer Battered Fish Sandwich and Chips. My burger was so greasy I couldn't stomach eating more than a few bites and my fries were both burnt and cold. My husband said he would trade me so he gave me his fish and it was flavorless and also too greasy to eat.  Since I don't live in the area The Hartwood Restaurant is not someplace I will be frequenting and if I visit the area again it is definitely not on my short list of places to eat. Pittsburgh has so many other fine dining restaurants I am sure there are much better places out there.",

Wife ordered diet coke but was dissapointed to find out they serve \"Pepsi\" but she got over it.    When we sat down the service was great and they suggested some things that we might like from the menu.   Food came pretty quick and my entree was outstanding. My 9 year old loved \"her \"cheeseburger\" and actually ate a full dinner for a change while my wife actually gave a compliment to the chef (she never does that).  The best part of the night came at the end when this guy showed up with the Stanley Cup (not sure who he was, looked like a front office guy). That's right, Lord Stanley himself showed up at the restaraunt.  If the Pittsburgh Penguins go there  Im all in!  Incredible night with outstanding food, a must for locals and visitors!!'",

This is one of my favorite places to escape the winter cold. Although I love when the patio is open in warmer weather and seasonal berries are incorporated into the salad.  The menu is mostly traditional, but everything is done exceptionally well and with great integrity. I am always at a loss what to order. But I always start the panco-crusted goat cheese salad - which adds delicious creamy warmth to the fresh greens. The soups are also a highlight for me. My boyfriend is always a fan of the turkey devonshire.  If you have not been to Hartwood, I highly recommend it. It is a great experience from start to finish and you would be hard pressed to find something you do not want to order.",

    "text": "Another couple took me & my husband out to celebrate my birthday & we wanted to try a new place. We went there on a Saturday evening & it was not very crowded or busy. We were surprised at the small menu for dinner. We expected more of a selection. We sat there for awhile, & the waitress came over & told us she was not informed initially that there was anyone at her table. We selected a bottle of wine, but the waitress brought out 2 different selections & said they were phasing out the wine we selected, an Italian Pinot Grigio. So we chose another wine. We had an appetizer which we shared & we had to use our bread plates, as the waitress did not bring out appetizer plates.. After we were finished, we did not receive fresh bread plates..The bread was delicious, as was the butter. Two of us had the Goat cheese salad & two had the chicken chili. The salads were very good. But I thought that my warm breaded & fried goat cheese tasted like the oil that it was fried in was old & should have been changed. No complaints about the chicken chili, it was served hot. My steak was cooked  medium rare as requested.The flavor of the steakwas so -so, although the texture was good.  My husband ordered his medium, and it was on the rare side. He did not request to send it back. The service was average at best. No one asked if it was our first time there or if we were celebrating anything. My friend took half of her salmon home, and as we were checking out the bar, a waitress bumped in to her & she dropped her salmon.The box was squashed & fell open & the salmon rolled on to the floor. The waitress just left it laying on the carpet & walked away.  The waitress apologized  but there was no offer to perhaps give Shirley something else to take home.The offer of  a dessert to take home would have been nice. This occured while in the bar. We sat down at a table & was preparerd to have an after dinner drink, but no one ever approached us to take our order. After sitting there about 7 minutes in this small bar, without having anyone approach us to take an order, we left. Bottom line is, there are too many excellent restaurants in Pittsburgh to settle for this place.",

Driving past it regularly, I just assumed it was a pub/grille serving bar food but I was wrong.  It's a great restaurant with really good food.  I've been here twice and we've loved all our meals.     Most recently we started with an artisanal cheese plate (they kindly left off the meat for us and gave us extra cheese), a house salad, vegetarian ravioli and a burger.   The sweet ravioli was in a brown butter sauce with carrots and pumpkin seeds.  Loved it.  They do change up the menu to be seasonal.  This past fall I had butternut squash ravioli that was equally good.  The house salad is a little on the small side.  They also have a nice selection of wine and beer.    I recommend a reservation as it does get crowded.  It's a relatively large place and there a several different rooms.  There is a library type area with a fireplace and the walls are lined with filled bookshelves.  I've also been wanting to try out the patio as it looks fun and relaxing.  Service can be a little slow but overall, great experience.",

    "text": "Update on our 4 star review from months back: Again, we reserved our favorite small private table on the balcony for my wife's birthday. The staff is always polite and efficient including our server for this evening. My issue with downgrading the restaurant is with the meals. Although very tasty, the management or chefs seem to be severely cutting the amount of food served. I have had the Mahi mahi & crab dish several times and have had no complaints. However, last night the the amount of fish was about half of what I have been served several times before, from about 4oz to about 2. And the amount of crab on top was a pitiful tablespoon at best, compared to at least 2-3 tblspns in the past, and all on a few tablespoons of rice pilaf which was also about half the amount I have experienced previously. I was still hungry when we left and I am not a big eater. Previously with these exact dishes I was always satisfied but not 'stuffed'. My wife's scallop dish also seemed paltry compared to previous experiences with this dish. It is apparent to me that they are drastically cutting back on the ingredients in meals and for $24 for the mahi dish and 28 for the scallop dish, I believe that the price does not justify the meal, regardless of taste. I chose not to call the manager, Jon, to discuss this as I didn't want to ruffle my wife's birthday dinner. I am also choosing not to contact Jon or the restaurant about this. I don't want a free meal or coupons or even an explanation. Maybe it's the chef's prerogative to skimp on the plates but I can no longer justify the prices for the paltry amount of food on the plate. We won't be returning. We don't go out to a restaurant like this but on special occasions and to spend nearly 100 bucks and to not be satisfied leaves my stomach feeling empty and a bad taste in my mouth. What was once our favorite place to dine on special occasions has been stricken from our list.",

I think it was more the fault of what I ordered than anything else as everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their meal.  I got the fish sandwich laced with crab meat and topped with homemade tartar sauce. I thought it was pretty bland tasting and I had to douse it with some ketchup to get some added flavor from it. I also ordered a side of the clam chowder which performed a lot better than the sandwich. It was a satisfactory cup of soup and hit the spot.  While waiting for your food, they serve you a basket of bread and butter to tie you over until your meal is served. I don't know if they serve it year round, but on this day they were serving a delicious sweet cranberry bread that my family gobbled up and even asked for seconds.  The outdoor seating here is really great and they even had infrared heaters to keep us warm since it was a little bit of a chilly fall evening. The indoor seating is equally good and is like sitting in a library or mom and pop book store with all of the wall shelving and books everywhere. Guests are even welcome to pick up a book from the shelves and read if they'd like.  A great environment and decent food. It's a place I enjoyed enough to come back and try again.",

After requesting more intimate seating while placing a reservation via phone, they seated us at a beautiful, cozy table-for-2 on a 2nd-floor balcony.  We were stunned! The entire meal was finished in a half-hour, as the Caesar salad, Hartwood Burger, Butternut Squash Ravioli, Pecan Ball, and Mulled Wines were all devoured. Major applause for the staff and our waitress for preparing food that quickly and walking up and down the stairs to provide for us. Cannot wait to go back!!!",

I've been going there since it was just the bookstore/cafe and have seen it grow.  It's a lovely facility.  My complaints revolve around service;  it is always too slow.  Between the time I'm seated and the time a server shows up is always too long.  Ditto getting food to the table.  I appreciate the quality of the food, but it still needs to get there quicker.  I realize this is in the heart of \"ladies who lunch\" territory, and perhaps they love to languish and dish while waiting for their meal -- but I don't.  I'll also mention that today, while my chix sandwich was good, the Brussel sprouts showed up almost cold.  I didn't bother complaining, as it would have disrupted my meal, but there is simply no excuse for that.  And, as I think overs may have noted, the lack of service seems to exist whether the place is swamped or (like today) almost empty.",

I don't care which gender you are--when you've been hiking on a winter's morn, you'll chow down afterwards!  I think we all started with the soup and we spilt an appetizer of the fruit and cheese plate.  Nothing warms you up like a good cup of hearty soup!    Feeling a bit adventurous, I tried the grilled chicken sandwich with szechuan barbeque and sweet potatoes.  That got my tastebuds warmed up and my innards warmed too!   Mmmm, metabolized so quickly!  My girlfriends tried the sun dried tomato wraps and I believe a couple of 'em went for the fish hoagies.    Hartwood Restaurant is the closest sit-down restaurant to Hartwood Acres.  It's worth a stop if you're going to a summer concert or to the Festival of Lights.",

The weather was perfect for dining outside. We got a table on the patio, which is shaded and located behind the restaurant, protected from the road noise. The menu is simple and hard to categorize as to cuisine or theme. I guess you have to call it American. There are appetizers, soups and salads, sandwiches, fish, meat, and pasta entres, and a couple of specials. We chose the fish specials, red snapper and halibut, both of which were excellent. We selected a California Chardonnay from the limited but well-constructed wine list. The wine prices are lower than I would expect for a restaurant of this quality. Other positives worth mentioning were the service (professional and properly paced) and the excellent free bread (Irish soda and baguette). We will definitely stop in when we are in the area and may even make the trek just to have dinner at The Hartwood.",

    "text": "I would give them a 4.5 if I could. We were planning dinner with friends and we were bouncing some ideas around. My bestie suggested Hartwood as none of us had ever been there. So, Hartwood it was. I made reservations for Saturday evening at 530. We got there and were seated promptly by a wonderful hostess. At first we thought, wow, didn't need reservations but the dining room filled very quickly and I would suggest reservations if you plan on going at 6 or later. We were seated in a wonderful, huge, warm, and inviting dining room surrounded by book shelves filled with books and next to a cozy fireplace (which was on and that made me happy). I have to add there is a bit of stained glass in the restaurant and it is magnificent!  Our waitress promptly came over and took drink orders. She provided us with impeccable service all evening refreshing our beverages and following up quickly with our drinks, food, desserts, and checks. We were provided with a beautiful bread basket which had a French baguette and Irish soda pop bread. I cannot say how the French baguette was but the soda pop bread was devine! It was warm, and salty, and sweet - yum! We all ordered apps. I chose a special, the salmon mousse drizzled with a vinagarette. I would describe it as a small salmon cake but my, oh my, they packed a punch with the flavor and the vinagarette was the perfect compliment. The hubbies ordered clam chowder which they liked a lot. My hubby noted it could have used a bit more clam. My Bestie ordered a salad and enjoyed it. For my entree I got the scallops anjou. The scallops were cooked perfectly, seared to perfection on a bed of butternut squash risotto. The risotto was also cooked and seasoned perfectly. I got the brussel sprouts as well and they were wonderful. Brussel sprouts can go wrong if not cooked well and they got it right! The hubby chose the duck and deferred to the chef on how it be cooked which was medium. The hubby enjoyed it tremendously. He noted that the crispy, salty skin with tender meat was paired perfectly with a fresh cherry compote, the perfect bite. The bestie got the wild mushroom and asparagus risotto which she loved noting it was perfectly seasoned and flavorful. The bestie's hubby got the cottage pie which he loved as well. The entrees are on the smaller side but that just means room for dessert! We all indulged. Me and my Bestie got the pecan ball. It is a big scoop of vanilla ice cream rolled in pecans and drizzled in caramel and hot fudge - how can you go wrong with that combination. It was so good! My hubby got the pecan pie which was terrific! He noted one bad thing about the pie, it wasn't a big enough piece! The bestie's hubby got the special: s'mores cup which he thought was okay. All in all this place is a gem and I can't understand why we haven't been there sooner but we will certainly go back! Great service, fantastic food, in a wonderfully warm dining room!",

I have never been to Hartwood Restaurant before but I was wowed with its atmosphere.  Floor to ceiling books, beautiful hardwood floors, burning fireplaces, and a tree (albeit faux) growing in the middle of the dining room.  Just this aspect alone was incredible.  Not to mention the food and the beer (I will also post this on Grist House, so don't judge :)    Our meal was specifically crafted toward the beers and the theme.  Oysters, Gumbo and King cake with a baby (and if you won, Hartwood gave you a free ticket to your beer/wine dinner of choice, unfortunately I left baby-less, but I did leave with some beads and a cool feather mask).  The owner of the restaurant gave a brief history lesson of Mardi Gras while the Grist House owners described their great product and stopped at each table.   Lastly, the chef came in and talked to the group and also stopped at each table.    The experience was great. You can tell that this isn't anyone's first rodeo.  Super professional, engaging, and educational and in a super cool venue.  Perfection..",

    "text": "This is a such charming place to visit and eat! It's ambiance is unique and quaint. We recently had our rehearsal dinner hosted here. The manager, John, was a pleasure to work with and very flexible. We rented out a room in the back that also had a patio attached, which was perfect for the beautiful evening. He even had customized menus made for us! The food here is excellent. Everyone really enjoyed their food. From the steak to the scallops to the salads to the massive desserts, all taste buds were satisfied.  I'm not giving five stars because the waitress helping our party kept making comments that she was pretty much annoyed with our large party under her breath that we could clearly hear, it was odd. Everyone was minding their own business and not once did we complain. The service wait for the entrees was very long too. Another time visiting for a normal lunch meal, the service was questionable too, as our waitress first forgot to put our order in, then didn't even get mine right.  With that being said, the food and wait are worth it if you have some time! There may just be a few bad apples within their crew. I would completely recommend for a unique place for a great meal in this area. Enjoy!",

The manager John was extremely helpful and he made sure our event went smoothly and exactly what we wanted. Awesome place for any event and their event pricing for lunches cant be beat.  The whole restaurant used to be an old book store, so there are many romantic nooks for a private dinner. The atmosphere is all about elegance; centering around books, wood, antiques and beautiful decor.   Their food is always fresh, playing off of natural fusion between ingredients and always incredibly taste.  The taste and look on each dish (sandwich or entree) are creative and filling so come hungry. I have had a number of dishes here and have never been disappointed...so I recommend anything they have on the menu.   Fyi, the drink selection is impressive and the out door patio is my favorite place to chill in Gibsonia in the summer.  The over all appearance and service of this place is straight out of Marth Stewart's magazine and you will not be disappointed.",

Staff was nice and accommodating when we didn't like the highboy we were originally seated at and moved us to a booth as soon as one opened.   Fox Chapel is generally short of good restaurant spots so this is one gem we'll be returning to. Loved the calamari. Decent drink options. And portions were generous but not ridiculous.   Tip: make reservations, even on weeknights.",

It was busy and not a lot of wait staff.  After getting waited on it didn't take too long to get our entrees. The Italian red we drank was excellent especially for only $10 a glass. I started out with the salad with the beets and it was fresh and a nice big portion.  I ordered the petite filet mignon and the sauce was so good, perfectly cooked and tender and juicy. My husband got the veal and he said it was superb.  He said the bread was good too. The prices are not bad for the quality and portions.  We will return but next time we will eat in the bar. It was so noisy that we couldn't carry on a conversation.",

    "text": "I had no idea this place existed.  My boyfriend surprised me for our anniversary to have dinner here. The great part about this place is that you can have a more casual night and go to the bar/pub area to the left when you walk in or having the nicer dinning area of the \"house.\" It's all open in the dinning area except for a back room and yet it the set up still gives an intimate and unique experience for your reservation, because there is a library feeling on some of the portions of the room, and a beautiful fireplace in one corner. There is also the open to go up a set of stairs and have a private table overlooking the room which is where we were seated. It was perfect for our celebration dinner!   We started with cocktails, I went with a sidecar and the bartender did a fantastic job. One of the best I've had. We then ordered a bottle of wine (which was also a great choice).   First, they brought out bread which included their own soda bread and it was absolutely incredible. We were told that they sell the loaves separately for $5 which we plan to go back for soon.   We ordered the special charcuterie board and oysters on the half shell for our appetizers. They cure their own meat, and each one was well done.   For dinner I had the Haibut special and my bf had the wigle whiskey flank steak. All I can say is the flavors were all there, the fish and steak were cooked perfectly for what we asked and it was just over all very well done on the chef's part. We were very impressed.  We finished with creme brulee for dessert and it was the perfect ending to a great night.   The staff and service just made the food all the better and we plan to keep this place in mind for many more date nights especially when it's warm outside and we can walk the estate grounds.",

The reason I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is the beer selection. Given we were in a pub I expected more than 5 domestic light beers on draft. Their beer selection could use a lot of work.",

There is a beautiful stained glass window. The prices are not cheap but given the care taken in the preparation it is worthwhile. My one quibble: their special multi-course dinners include matched wines. Since we do not drink, I don't want to pay for the alcohol.",

Paul was our waiter and he said it was only his second week here and he was AWESOME. We got the four course wine pairing that is selected by one of the bartenders. Ours was absolutely perfect. He paired one white, two medium reds and a port (neither of us were big fans but the other three were absolutely perfect). We weren't totally sure of the second red upon his description but it was wonderful. I said he got me better than my husband we had the goat cheese appetizer, whiskers salads- all great. My husband got he scallops which were wonderful. I had the mahi which I ordered medium and was a little dry for me but still good. If I went back, I'd get the scallops. We also got the dessert- the cobbler was amazing and they threw in champagne. Really a great experience.",

I had a cranberry mule which was served in its copper mug and delicious. I ordered the Hartwood burger which was a combination of chopped beefs with bacon cheddar sauteed mushrooms and onions.

    "text": "Wasn't able to obtain reservations but was told if there by 5:30 the wait would be minimal. When arrived hostess indicated 45 min wait. When I asked 60 min. later was told it would be 30 more min. In 30 more min. we were still waiting in the bar area. Spoke with manager who indicated we could order and he would seat us at next available table. THIS NEVER HAPPENED and we spent the entire meal in the bar. Since this was a special occasion we were highly disappointed. Our waitress was top notch and the food was excellent but we will never return. Being disrespected isn't something we expect in this type of restaurant. The manager couldn't look us in the eye and never returned. There are too many great restaurants in the area to waste our time at Hartwood in the future. They need to get it together when it comes to wait time.",

We made reservations, but it appeared they still had a lot of seating despite the parking lot being packed. The atmosphere is nice, with a lot of things to look at while you are dining that make the experience unique. The empanadas for an appetizer were great, the soda bread is excellent, my burger was cooked great and huge, and my husbands pasta with lobster and shrimp was awesome. We would definitely recommend coming here!",
