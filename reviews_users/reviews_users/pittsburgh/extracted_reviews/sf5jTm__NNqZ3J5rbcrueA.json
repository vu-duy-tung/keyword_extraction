This particular visit was at the Monroeville restaraunt. It was a welcome spot after walking around all day at the convention center. Speaking of which, this place is in easy driving or walking distance of the mall and convention center.  Of course I have heard of the famous Primante sandwiches so I had to order the standard with double meat, egg, and onions. Wow! Absolutely unreal.   This was a huge sandwich. We were warned not to use silverware and once it was picked up, we weren't to set it down. I loved that from the waitress.  A friend also ordered a small pizza to go along with his sandwich. It was one of the best pizzas I have had in a long time. He remarked that it reminded him of the pizza he use to have when he was in Italy for the Army.   I truly have nothing bad to say about the place. They had my favorite Sam Adams on tap. The waitress was great. The atmosphere was excellent. I would drive the six hour round trip just to experience it again.",

    "text": "You know a restaurant and it's famous sandwiches are good when a reviewer from Philadelphia and a Washington Capitals fan can admit that these are uniquely delicious.  Primantis is a staple of Pittsburgh culture. Yes, a sandwich can be that influential. When I visit a Primanti Brothers restaurant, I tend to order the Cajun chicken sandwich because it's simply that good. Well prepared chicken, home made coleslaw, crisp French fries. It doesn't take complex algorithms to understand that this combination is heavenly.  The service at the Monroeville location is very good. I know a lot of the servers and everybody who's waited on my friends and I have always had a cheerful demeanor. The food is served promptly as well. One quick tip for this particular location: don't rest your beers near the edges of the warped tables, unless you have quick reflexes.  One of the reasons I frequent Primantis as often as I do is the Penguins and Steelers game specials. Get your wonderfully mediocre IC Lights for as cheaply as they're made. In all honesty though, the specials here are extremely competitive. You can easily get a quality dinner and a few beers during a hockey or football game for around $10 - which is impressive for this city. Especially at an establishment that won't require Tetanus shots after.  Out of towners, add \"Grab a Primantis Sandwich\" to your list of things to experience when you're in Pittsburgh. You won't regret it.",

It wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had, but it was a good serving size and solid lunch spot. Sandwich is a bit messy but that's to be expected when you throw fries inside (I'm a fan). Just not sure how anyone manages to eat this in a vehicle (I'm sure it happens - they started by catering to truckers).   We sat at the bar since we were trying to make it a quick visit. The mood seemed odd - not sure if it was because we were there on a Sunday afternoon. It worked fine for us...we were just excited that they have a good beer selection. We enjoyed our sandwich and a great PA beer (Java Head by Troegs) before hitting the road again a cross country journey from DC to Seattle. Kept us full and really hopeful that we were going to eat some decent local eats and brews on this road trip.",

The colossal fish, cheese-steak, corned beef and egg, smallman street fries and fried pickles are some favorites! Sandwiches here are great every time with one exception of a colossal fish that was more deep fried breading than fish and had been clearly sitting under a heat lamp too long; but normally this is not the case.   The only reason I have to give this particular location of Primanti brother's 4 out of 5 stars is the service. It is often hit or miss with this place. The reason we like Primanti's is that it can be a quick place to grab a bite to eat and not somewhere where you wait endlessly for your meal. We almost always sit at the \"seat yourself\" bar area and are usually greeted by a waitress right away. However, sometimes once seated it can take us 30-45 minutes to eat or up to 2 hours for a party of TWO to eat and get out of there. It really just depends on the day for whatever reason. The waitresses are never rude, however everything just can be VERY slow and sometimes I have been there for dinner, had to wait and never had my drink re-filled unless I asked several times. This is a pet peeve for me.   If you are in Pittsburgh, it's definitely worth a trip, but just be sure you're not in a hurry...",

Likes: Great for watching Pittsburgh team games, friendly bar atmosphere, comfort of food that's overloaded for reasonable prices, facilitates large groups, and the detailing is spot on with a lot of Pittsburgh-esque memorabilia such as Pirates or Steelers portraits and gear!  Dislikes: Not sure if it was my luck but the tables are maybe particularly curved and not flat (mind you, I've ate at this location twice and I always feel like I have to play tipsy turvy with my meals and drinks since it might slide off the table), and if you're looking for a calming lunch/dinner it's a bit too noisy since it is a sporty atmosphere.  Overall, Primanti defines Pittsburgh all into one sandwich! Such a fun and tasty way of dining with family and friends, or maybe yourself. I wouldn't mind coming back~ black and yellow!",

When I arrived, I stood there like a dope for 8 minutes until someone finally seated me.  I could see 15 empty tables and I was a single.  Irritating.  Then, I got the single most wobbly table I have ever sat at.  I was going to move, but frankly, I checked the one next to me and it seemed marginally better so I gutted it out at the gyro scoping table.  Irritating.  How can a restaurant make its customers sit at crappy tables?  Thankfully after that intro, it got better.  Friendly waitress.  I got a side salad, which was surprisingly decent for a gastro-pub.  I got the meatball sandwich which was great. Meatballs the size of pool balls and the whole Sammy the size of a Duke Jr football.  It was quite tasty.  I'd recommend it.  If the roll was toasted, it would have been epic.  No toasted roll was a bit of a surprise.  The fries are awesome!  If I was starving, or, had just run 26.2 or 13.1, this place would get probably 3-4 stars.  It is the definition of \"gastro\" pub, because trust me, my gastro will be working overtime tonight.",

I got the turkey and cheese overstuffed sandwich and it was good, but again nothing out of this world. It is very comparable to The Winking Lizards or Panini's in the Cleveland area in terms of atmosphere, food selection, and number of locations (but I like Winking Lizard better).

They don't have a lot of specialty beers on draft, most of them are cheap domestics. They do however have craft beers in the bottle, maybe 10 -12 choices.  We really wanted a salad so we shared the caribbean chopped salad with mango vinaigrette. It said it came with apple wood smoked bacon, shredded cheddar cheese and corn which sounded great. But when the salad came to the table it looked like a premixed bag tossed with corn, bacon bits, no onions and the cheese were those tiny shreds. I was not impressed at all. for $8.49 I'm expecting more than bacon bits and cold freezer burned chicken. Yea the chicken on my salad was hard and warm like the through it in the microwave from frozen.  I only really like to play pool here or get a sandwich otherwise its not worth it to me.",

I only give it 4 stars because of what it was before. I remember when they would cut the sandwich and put it into bigger trays for you.   Pros: good service, clean atmosphere, food is great tasting and delivered in a timely fashion, cheap, unique foods  Cons: the chicken wings were a little dry, the sandwichs are put on a plate that is too small for the sandwich  Overall: I always like going to Primanti's when I'm in town. A must go for anyone passing through.",

    "text": "There isn't a Primanti Bros. in NY and with everyone in Pittsburgh praising their food (and me loving food), I had to give this place a try. When you enter, you're welcomed with a more \"at home\", relaxed vibe than say an Applebee's or Outback Steakhouse. It's spacious and doesn't feel cramped. Dress code...what dress code? Just come as comfortable as you'd like. :) Perfect for families or super cool and friendly dates.  Although I didn't dine in and opted rather for takeout - I was given a full dose of in-house service. If it's a particular busy day, be prepared to sort of awkwardly wait at the front entrance until someone sees you. For me, once that happened, everything else was pretty much smooth sailing. Service was efficient and friendly. Order was for the chicken club sandwich and fries, 9 inch pizza, and pecan pie.  :) When we reached back to the hotel, I understood why so many people go bonkers for this place. First, portion. Huge, huge portions. Secondly, taste. Not overly seasoned but packs enough punch to leave you incredibly full and satisfied. Pricing seemed reasonable and along with the service we received, worth it. They don't skimp on any ingredients either. Everything was full and brimming over. Will definitely try this place.",

So sorry for the wait or anything, the hostess just came up and handed me my bag of food. And no...the restaurant was not busy at all! I only saw two two tables in the dining area and three customers at the bar the entire time I was there. There was no excuse for the food to be ready 40 minutes later. I got the Pitts-burger which was only so-so. The fries were bland and the sandwich itself did not live up to the hype.",

Consistently, this place's wait staff is the pits!  They do not care to greet you at the table when you first sit down.  We usually wait 10 minutes on a non-busy night for one of them to walk by.  The last time I flagged down who I thought was the floor manager on duty--when I told her that we had been waiting for someone to come over to us for 10 minutes, she didn't apologize or flinch!  The frustrating thing is that it looks as if the girls are all gathered at the window taking to the cooks.  Or maybe they were doing their duties prior to leaving their shift?  NO matter what, they weren't waiting on us!  Good tip:  eat at the bar!  I'm sure they are much more attentive!",

When our food came, the bread on my sandwich was hard, as if it had been sliced early in the day and left out. The other two sandwiches were fine. I brought it to the attention of the bartender, she apologized and returned it to the kitchen. We shared a laugh about it, no big deal. A few minutes later, out comes the \"manager\" with my new sandwich. He tells me that there was nothing wrong with the sandwich that I sent back! I couldn't believe that he really wanted to debate the issue! I bit my tongue out of respect for my family but this experience will not be forgotten.

It was between Olive Garden and Primanti Bros. My gut said Olive Garden all day long, to which my peers said Primanti Bros. I was hesitant from the beginning but took the journey 0.8 miles down the street. At Primanti Bros, we tried the Buffalo Wings that were \"famous\" but were extremely disappointing from residents of Buffalo ourselves. My peers described the wings as \"terrible\" and this was the beginning of our interesting meal. Next up came the sandwiches, and still to this day I do not know the #1 seller. Instead I ordered the #2 best seller, \"The Pitts-Burger\". The Burger was over-cooked and the fries were a bit too much. As you read this review, you may think to yourself, How the Hell do this place get 2 stars. Well the one bright spot was the friendly waitress who dealt with us but does not know real Chicken Wings. Overall the moral is trust your gut and go to Olive Garden instead of this underwhelming restaurant!",

Portions - average. I can finish the whole sandwich in one sitting. Creativity - not too many options to choose from. The fries being INSIDE the sandwich turns them soggy and flavorless.  Taste - very mediocre. Cole slaw is one of my favorite sides and it was bland and too vinegary. The bread they use is not grilled or buttered or anything. Weak.  My husband originally raved about this place being so filling and just what he needed. Later on he tried Melt and forgot about this place entirely. I asked him again what he thought of Primanti's and he chalked up his initial reaction to not having a sandwich in a long time. At the time, it hit the spot.",

    "text": "If I could give this place less stars, I would. I'm incredibly angry my husband and I stopped here on our cross country trip. (We grew up near Harrisburg PA and now live in CO) We had several Pittsburgh friends relentlessly hound us that this place is the absolute best and that we needed to try it out. So we went out of our way to get off the turnpike to give this place a shot. It was a complete waste of an hour and a half of our lives...  We both got the Pitts-burger, which seemed to be their flagship item. I got mine without slaw, my husband with slaw. I didn't mind the French fries on the sandwich (I've put them on my own burgers before) but my husband thought they were too squishy and not crispy enough. I expected the meat to taste more like and have the consistency of a regular hamburger patty. It did not.... It tasted and had the consistency more along the lines of a meatball or a slice of meatloaf. It was also very bland. My husband describes his sandwich as biting through a chunk of mashed potatoes.   Service was incredibly bad. We waited about 10 -15 minutes before the waitress even came to take our drink order. We placed our food order when we placed our drink order and proceeded to watch as two tables sat after us received their food. The couple at the table next to us were able to eat and settle their tab before we even got our food. During our meal, the waitress passed our table several times without checking in, and getting the bill took forever. In attempting to pay, we were simply going to leave the money on the table because she was taking so long, but we were seated next to the bathroom and didn't want someone else to walk off with it.  Needless to say, we will not be visiting this place again. And if this is supposed to be one of the better places to eat in Pittsburgh, I'd hate to visit the rest of their restaurants!  Don't waste you time and effort on this place! On our whole trip back to CO, we wanted to try local restaurants instead of just grabbing fast food but I'd much rather go to Mc Donald's over this place...",

It also took quite awhile for our food to come to the table.  We were at Primantis to meet up with extended family who live out of town/state. Every time they come to town they like to eat here. Most of them ordered the Pittsburgher. They seemed to like their food but I was disappointed.   Here's hoping for a better experience and better food next time.",

The fries on my sandwich were cold. They detracted from the experience rather than enhance it. When the bill came, 2 of my children had ordered kids meals but the server charged the adult price for drinks. This was nearly $6. I brought it to her attention and she argued that she brought them large drinks. I told her to take them off. Add in the SCREAMING child in the next booth with the irresponsible parents who did nothing to calm her down and we had a less than desirable experience at Primanti Bros.",

I was thrilled to hear there were some near my hometown in Greensburg - we came to this location to meet cousins from Pittsburgh halfway.  There were 11 of us, but this was no problem for our waitress.  We received excellent and fast service - even though 2 hours flew by before we knew it as we all hadn't seen each other in years!  We tried the fried pickles - GREAT with the exception of my pickle coming out of the fried stuff - I hate when that happens!  I just had to try the Pittsburgher - FANTASTIC!!!  It was stuffed with a meatloafy, coleslawy, tomatoey, French friey goodness!!  WOW!  I spent at least 5 minutes figuring how to eat this monstrosity, and started with pulling fries out of the sandwich, but didn't want to do that too much as I also wanted to eat them in the sandwich!  The bread was nice and thick too. I want to go back the next time I'm to try the fish sandwich!  There were options on the menu for those who wanted salads, but I can't imagine who would want a salad with amazing sandwiches that are served up here.  Loved the environment too - there was a bar side of the room with pool tables, and a family-style sit down dining area.  Lots of local sports pics and memorabilia - you really feel like you're in Pittsburgh here.  I think this might have to be a regular trip for me every time I'm back home!",

They are big, gastro treats.  The rest? Meh.  Unfortunately service was less than I'd hoped for. The staff was disinterested at best. Food arrived at the table randomly. The restaurant wasn't clean.   And then there are the wings. So disappointing. They are breaded as if they were from KFC. That's already a strike against. The sauce we tried was bland. Strike two. The breading turned then into greasy bombs. Strike three.  Conversely, the giant pickle was excellent.  Would I go back? Maybe to another location.",

After waiting 30-35 minutes after ordering, our waitress, Cheyenne, came to our table to let us know our food would be out soon. It did not arrive for another 25 minutes. We had to wait another five minutes for our waitress to even bring us silverware after we asked for it. She did not come back to the table to see if we needed anything, or to refill drinks. All four of our drinks were completely empty and she did not even glimpse at them. She only returned to bring the check. It took her close to ten minutes to come back to get the check, and we then asked for boxes and refills on our waters. She brought the check back with no pen to sign it, no waters, and no boxes. Then she brought a pen, a box, and one cup of water. It was truly horrible. So upsetting because I love this restaurant. Food was great as usual, but my god, our waitress was terrible!!",

    "text": "It seems Primanti purists dislike suburban locations because of the increased menu options and space, but as a mom of twins, it's one of the reasons I like this location.  The restaurant is split into the bar side and restaurant side.  Both sides have TVs and similar seating but the bar side tends to be louder.  They do have high chairs and kids menus available which is a huge plus in my book these days.   The menu has the reasonably prices traditional Primanti sandwiches.  You can also add things like egg or double meat.  The menu also has wings, various appetizers, salads, pizzas and sandwiches.  There are daily specials as well.  I'm a wing lover and Sunday is 50 cent wings! Service was friendly (although a bit slow) and all of our food was as promised on the menu and quite tasty. Overall a nice experience.",

I'm not going to review what is so unique about Primanti's. Google it. However, in regards to this establishment, the servers were pleasant (we came in with a large party), accommodating, and quick.

They're famous for meat-heavy sandwiches stuffed with fries which leaves you full and happy.  He got the Cajun Chicken and Cheese and I went with Pastrami and Cheese.  I think the slaw is what really makes the sandwiches - thinly shredded and vinegary!  The bread was too thick and soft for my liking but I usually prefer my sandwiches toasted so if I have a chance to go to Primanti Bros again, I'll ask for it toasted.  Service was good and it's definitely an ideal stop to watch games and for large group gatherings.  I'm glad I visited and while the experience wasn't totally memorable, I can totally see why Primanti Bros is a Pittsburgh highlight.",

I've been to Primanti's before, and from the brief time i was inside, this one looks to be a lot bigger than what I am accustomed too. That's cool!  There is plenty of parking, but be warned, the parking lot is connected to a small strip mall and people do not know how to drive there! So be mindful when you're parking. But there are lots of spots to park. I ordered around 11 or so, and my food was ready in about 10 minutes. Which is perfect- I was about 10 minutes away at the time!   When I arrived, I wasn't sure where to go. There is no where directing you. I assumed bar, but I double checked with one of the servers when she walked by and it was the bar. It wasn't super packed, but I did go on a weeknight.   The bartender quickly cashed me out. I had placed an online order, so all I needed to do was give her my name and she confirmed the food I ordered. Food took about 2 extra minutes to come out, which was no big deal to wait at all.   We ordered the bacon and cheese sandwich and added egg to it. The Primanti's signature way of making sandwiches is to throw the fries and coleslaw on it. Unfortunately, they don't cut the sandwich in half here, so it was kind of difficult to eat. No to-go silverware was included in our bag, and we did not have any silverware in the car. Next time, I'll try to remember to ask for some! I also ordered buffalo boneless wings with celery and ranch.   Food was really good, and hot when we picked it up. They gave me plenty of ranch for my wings, which was good because I've often noticed restaurants tend to not give enough condiments. No problem here!  Overall had a good experience, will probably come back again. Maybe this time we'll dine in, since we know there is plenty of space!",

For starters, I had to wait 15 minutes to get my food, when it was right in front of me. The first person verified my order, went to the kitchen, came back to tell me someone would ring me out shortly. Minutes pass and a new person came to me, same thing, verified, went to back, told me I had to wait.  Next, the first person came to me and asked if I was helped yet. Told her no one has has yet to ring this up and I want to speak to a manager. Guess what? A third person came around the corner and said they could do it for me. I had to wait 15 minutes...WHY!?!?  So, all that made my star rating for down and what else made it go down was this. My food was cold, went there when I was told to and had to wait all that time. Yup, food was cold. They also didn't give me the ranch I asked for and marinara sauce.  The wings were dry and cold, the cheese wedges were cold, the salad looks fine (saving it for another day), and the pizza was cold. Cold...cold...cold...COLD!!!!",

Had fried pickles for an app and turkey primanti sandwich. Omg how I missed these. Absolute perfection. Drinks were 1/2 off 9-11 so we stayed and watched the fights. I have no complaints about this location. Thank you for making my trip to Pittsburgh worth while!",

    "text": "I was happy to have visited this location of Primanti's while in town to see the hubby's family in Pittsburgh and Greensburg. We went for a lunch and for it being the day after Christmas, I honestly expected a lot more staff to be available than there were. There were plenty of open seats, but diners had to wait for quite a while before being seated since the staff working the floor were busy delivering orders or placing them and it seemed like cleaning the tables off had the lowest priority.   I'll be quite honest, we were a large party:18 adults, and our server was visibly stretched a bit thin, but managed to stop by the table twice to make sure our glasses were filled...   Compared to other locations I have visited, this Primanti just wasn't the same when it came to the food. The hubby and I split an order of the pastrami and had a few bites of the corned beef as well. The corned beef seemed a bit off (not rotten, but just did not taste as flavorful and actually was a bit gamey). The pastrami, thankfully, was superb. It was salty the bread and the slaw together had a nice bite. I was a bit disappointed because I didn't feel there were enough fries crammed in the sandwich and it was a bit drier than I anticipated, as if the sandwich was put together in a hurry and not allowed time to let the juices soak a bit. I was also upset with the flavor of the onion rings. The oil clearly needed to be changed because it had that bitter, sharp, taste that just made the rings taste awful. I think eventually this was done since we also placed an order of the fried zucchini later and those did not have that same taste. The cornmeal batter on the zucchini was quite tasty and I enjoyed the longer, planked shape these were served as rather than circular pieces I have seen elsewhere. We also shared an order of the nachos and I felt the ratio of chips to the \"good stuff\" was very off. A lot of us basically just had sour cream and dry chips.   Also, where is the Pittsburgh pride? Sure, sure, there are jerseys and sport memorabilia all around, but I am talking about the generic ketchup bottles on the table. I could taste the Heinz inside, but was surprised that the bottles were not Heinz bottles themselves.  I don't think we will return to this location since we are not usually in the area, but I was thankful that there was plenty of free parking right outside the location.",

Good presentation. The first few bites were pretty good. But at the end I was left with a gut-full of regret. But, part of that could be the nature of the food in general, meaning it's heavy food I should've known what I was in for.   It was supposed to be a warm sandwich and I got cold pretty quick. The vanilla shake was pretty average too nothing to write home about.",

Mild sports bar feel, a few Tvs scattered around, good bar, but the focus is on the menu.  Sandwiches are king here, big sandwiches.  4 of us at the table had either pastrami or corned beef sandwiches. Each was controlled by thick and fresh slices of Italian bread and then loaded with meat, coleslaw and fries in between. Not one of us finished the sandwiches, they are more than a meal.  The fifth person with us had a small pizza, when upon arrival looked more like a large size elsewhere.  Nice go to place, food is high quality, high content, but low priced.  Service is well orchestrated, perfect. I get it being the local go to place my co-workers raved about.",

He delivered dinner to our home and gave us a generous gift certificate.  We have used the certificate twice now at the Monroeville location and the food was great. On Friday, November 1, 2013 we visited the restaurant again with friends. We had a great meal and I had $10.20 remaining on the card. When the waitress brought our bill, we gave her the gift card. She took the card and came back stating that it wouldn't go through because their \"gift card\" reader wasn't working. She proceeded to say that we couldn't use it at that time. We paid for our meal.  My concern is that there's not a \"Plan B\" if the gift card reader isn't working. What if a family receives a gift card and takes their family out to dinner and doesn't necessarily have the funds to pay for the meal if the \"gift card\" reader isn't working? I know plenty of families that could fall into this scenario.",

I really wished I read the review here before I went, for I ordered the steak and cheese and was really displeased with the texture of the  meat. It resembled the texture of chicken fried steak, which is spongy. The fries were the boardwalk kind and I don't like that. My dining companion ordered the Colossal fish and it was very large. That was a more appropriate texture and it was very crispy and crunchy. I also was not pleased with the thick white bread which really should be toasted or else it just tears apart with the wet components.  Messy messy!",

The restaurant has a local family type place feel that you could also enjoy a beer and watch a game. I hate Pittsburgh sports so I can not take points away since I know this is in Pittsburgh and it covered in the stuff. I got the Corned Beef and it was well cooked and just enough of the other toppings.  The kids menu is pretty expansive and had about 8 different things for a child to choose. You get used to having about 4 to 5 normally. Overall I must say I would enjoy and go back.",

The fries and coleslaw were good, but not anything special.  The overall concept intrigued me, but it didnt really deliver on any level.  I'd say check out one of their other locations, which seem to have better reviews, but I'm not quite sure it was worth the excessive hype.",

The sandwich was tasty and large. It has a uniqueness with fries piled on top and a great coleslaw mixture. The setting is more like a pub but it was comfortable. If you are ever in the Pittsburgh area I would definitely recommend trying the place.",

See, I was born and raised just outside of Philly so I decided to order the Philly Cheesesteak Primanti Sandwich.  I'm used to flank steak, chopped and sauteed, slathered wit' wiz not a pressed flavorless brick of mystery meat and a slice of provolone.  My fault right?  I was back in Pittsburgh this December and gave these guys another chance.  This time I ordered the Roast Beef Primanti Sandwich, hot juicy shaved roast beef, provolone, fries and their signature slaw.  Delicious!  The service was fast, my food piping hot and football was on.  All was right with the world.",

    "text": "Perhaps my taste buds have died.  Or perhaps it's mass hysteria that is causing everyone to rave about these \"almost famous\" sandwiches.  Because yet again, I visit a TV featured restaurant only to find I have been suckered in by the hype.  We visited Primanti Bros. Monroeville a few days ago for dinner while we were passing through PA.  The waitress was very nice.  No problems there.  I ordered some chicken wings.   Crispy on the outside with a good sauce.  They were good.  (Except for the one that was ice cold inside!)  I ordered the Cappicola & Cheese.  I waited and hoped.  And....I was disappointed.  It was a sandwich.  An average sandwich with little flavor or excitement.  The \"slaw\" is shredded cabbage soaked in vinegar.  Maybe there's a touch of sugar in it as well.  But it's unremarkable.  I was so bored with the sandwich that I didn't even bother to finish about 1/3 of it.  It was that unexciting, that unappealing.  My husband had the black angus sandwich, and it was average, too.  There is nothing to write home about, and nothing to be excited about.  Maybe the original restaurant is where all the good food is, because I've had better sandwiches at my local, no frills, diner.",

    "text": "What touristy, first-time trip to Pittsburgh would be complete without a visit to its most famous and well-known restaurant?  As far as I was concerned, Primanti's was the top priority on my list of places to hit in the Steel City.  After reading the reviews on Yelp, I wasn't convinced that this would be the most delicious and life-changing sandwich I'd ever eat., but its iconic status makes it worth the experience.  I had really wanted to visit the original Primanti's, but since I was staying in Monroeville with my boyfriend's family, this location was clearly more convenient.  The inside reminded me of a Buffalo Wild Wings, or maybe a TGI Fridays-- family friendly, open, laid-back, and filled up wall-to-wall with decorations.    I ordered the pastrami sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the cappicola, with the idea that we would each share our respective halves.  I was pleasantly surprised with how soft the bread was.  I think I was expecting more of a crusty sourdough type, but it was actually really light.  The cole slaw was vinegar based (which I like) and gave the sandwich a nice sour bite.  I prefer my fries extra crispy, so I was naturally disappointed with the sogginess that came with the cole slaw/fry combination.  I think I preferred the cappicola; it had a certain spiciness that the pastrami was lacking.    Luckily I was able to finish the entire sandwich (proudly!).  Even though I expect to return to Pittsburgh at some point, I'm really glad I got the chance to try out Primanti's on this trip.  The sandwich wasn't the best I've ever had in my life, but it was satisfying and certainly unique.",

I was in Monroeville, PA, and there's a Primanti Bros. nearby, so I had to go!  I had their famous Black Angus Sirloin Steak Sandwich and a Sam Adams Alpine Springs brew.  The sandwich was very good, but what makes it good is the cole slaw.  The meat was just ok. the provolone was there (I think...), the tomatoes were good and of course the fries were there and added that strange combination texture that tastes great!  But it's that very-vinegary cole slaw that is addicting!  Put it all on thick, Italian bread, and you've got a messy sandwich that shouldn't be missed.",

I am also a realist that remembers for each person that told me that I NEED to check this place out, a story of drunken shenanigans was close by, and the sandwich had the all of the right elements of a great drunken meal.
