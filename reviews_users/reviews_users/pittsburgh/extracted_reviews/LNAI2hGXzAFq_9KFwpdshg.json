Except we found out that wasn't until 9pm.  And happy hour didn't start until 5:30 so until then Miller Lites were $6.  The bar looked nice inside but the bartender couldn't be bothered.  No thanks, 1 miller lite and left.",

    "text": "This is THE place to be before a sporting event in Pittsburgh!!!!!!  We came on a game day to see the Steelers.  Most of the places in the area were super packed with no chance of getting a seat or service.  We just wanted a place with room to move that we could hang out at before the game.  We found our spot at Mcfadden's!  It is literally steps away from PNC park and very close to Heinz field. They have a huge bar area with TV's everywhere you look and TONS of space to hang out or grab a seat.  They even had a real-life DJ playing music----WHAT?!?!  How fun is that!!!  The music was loud but the selections were one's you couldn't help but smile and sing along with.  The game day crowd didn't stop us from quickly being served at a table near the bar.  The tap selections were impressive and we loved the mix of Irish and American mash-up items on the menu.  We decided to share the Reuben dip, Randy's Rueben, and mango habanero wings.  They did not disappoint!  Possibly one of the best Rueben's we have ever had, although still up for debate between my husband and I.  The service was excellent and the server had some great recommendations for things to see next time we visit Pittsburgh.  For being so busy on a game day, everything was exceptional. We were having so much fun that it was hard to leave for the game.  When it comes to pregaming in Pittsburgh, we have finally found our forever home in Mcfadden's!",

Went on a Saturday night before the casino with some of my friends and we are all in medical school so it was an eclectic bunch.  Greek, Colombian, Ethiopian, Indian.  It was like the United Nations descended on yinzburgh.  I grew up in California and have never felt so distinctly Chinese in my life.  Lubed ourselves up with alcohol, started browning out somewhere near 11pm, told a girl I had escaped from North Korea and taught myself perfect English while in the labor camps.  Sorry, if you're reading this.  I grew up in Fremont CA and I feel terrible, but not because I went to McFaddens",

We also had the chance to eat while we were there and while the food was pretty awesome, the service was slow, and this was even before the crowd for the Steelers game came in. Around 11:30 am, the place was so packed with crazy Steelers fans you could barely move. It was shoulder to should, but so much fun. Most of the people that were there were also going to the game, so around 1 pm most of the crowd had cleared.  All in all, it was a good visit and I wouldn't mind going back sometime on a weeknight to enjoy the environment a little more.",

We had an issue with another customer once and the  security was immediately on it and the managers were quick to check if the situation was handled. I would definitely recommend this bar to anyone from Pittsburgh or from out of town visiting and going to Pirates/Steelers games. The experience is all worth it and it's a much better atmosphere than going to the Southside or Shadyside every weekend. Good food, good staff, and good music. Plus it's right next to the river, PNC Park and Heinz Field.",

We were in town for my buddy's bachelor party and after the game we decided to stop in here since it was right next to the stadium.  We got there about 9pm on a Saturday and it was very casual and not very busy.. yet. We were hanging out drinking watching some sports on TV and slowly but steadily the place starts filling up, the lights go down and a pretty good DJ starts spinning. Within an hour the place was packed with people dancing everywhere and having a good time. There were people packing the dance floor and others dancing on top of the bar. At one point the staff was on top of the bar pouring shots into people's mouths. I did not complain. I heard they started charging a cover after we got there. Also noticed there were one or two bachelorette parties being celebrated at the same time.  The bartender was also very helpful. As we were drinking we told her about the bachelor party and she got the manager to approve giving us wristbands which allowed us to drink for half off while the bachelor was free! What a great gesture for us and our wallets.  This place really turned the party into a blast.",

It was impossible to get a drink and I'm not a hater by any means by it's really annoying that you let workers and whoever they want dance on the bar. People were basically trying to get around the people on the bar to get to the bartender to get a drink. The floor at this bar was DISGUSTING!!!!! I couldn't even walk on it. Like you had to really peel your feet off the bottom of it to move. My group and I joked that you kind of have to shuffle to move. So I am thinking of those people's feet being on that floor and then walking all over the bar where people are trying to get served and touching. It was just gross.        It's a shame because this bar is a great location, but not clean and doesn't look like any money is being put into it. I will say the DJ played good music however. But really, this place needs some good TLC and maybe get the people off the bars and build them a little dance stage area.",

A more recent experience left us SO impressed and grateful for the amazing customer service. My friends and I had been to McFaddens the weekend of Halloween and ended up winning the group costume contest. Little did we know, McFaddens was giving us all Steelers tickets for the win! We were bummed out to find out that we had one less ticket than the number of people in our costume group and were expecting for one of us not to be able to go. Then one of the managers, Randy, followed up with where they had gotten the tickets from and went out of his way to get us an extra ticket so that all of us could enjoy the prize! My friends and I thank Randy and McFaddens for caring so much about their customers and always providing such a fun atmosphere and great experience!! Highly recommend giving McFaddens a try!",

The waitress was a very sweet girl but overwhelmed since she was the only one taking care of us WTF. the few times the other girl came out she was dismissive just as the other reviews state. She told one of us that they don't have BBQ sauce during game nights????.My sister asked for a rolling rock and a hour later told her they didn't have it. My daughter asked with ID in hand for a ic light mango and she just walked by So i pretty much Knew that wasn't going to happen.. Drinks were never served food that was ordered never came. I get it sometime mistakes happen most likely before a Pirate game but when we got there at 430 they weren't busy and My husband sitting at a bar table was not  even asked if he wanted a drink as he sat in the Bar waiting to direct the other people we were waiting for to their seats The hostesses and there were a few couldn't be bothered with that to busy talking to each <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fother.My&s=dce5b6ba2d95d9a69cc75c2b54d3ad0b06bf5590235c39cd5b54eae90bb757ef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">other.My</a> only guess is poor management I mean The Pirates are playing on Father's day weekend and you are sadly understaffed . The waitress who was trying so hard to take care of us and  I hope you Are not turned off by this .I personally felt you did as best as you could just under bad management . I'm not just a person who doesn't understand  Our company is a restaurant we were all wait staff bartenders and owners of a restaurant.and we tried to help out as much as we could We all been crazy busy ourselves We told the girl who brought out food out  to put the tray down on the table and call out the food we would come to her since they had no tray jacks. it should of been better. Thankfully the beautiful Park and The Pirates winning saved the day",

Most of the places in the area were super packed with no chance of me getting a seat or any service. McFaddens was an exception. They have a huge bar area and where were plenty of seats and places to stand right at the bar and order a drink and meal.   Apart from the convenience of being the only place close to the park where I could get service, I found the place to be just average. I had a couple of Yuengling drafts and a chicken sandwich. The beer selection is OK, but not too extensive. The chicken sandwich was also just OK. It was a buffalo chicken sandwich. I've had similar sandwiches at many places and the one here was a little smaller than most I've had.   One positive item was the service. The ladies behind the bar were really friendly and attentive.",

I'm not sure how they managed to have their soda taste not only flat but totally stale, but they did. Once again, two sips then I was done. Had a Sam Adams Octoberfest on draft which at least I could drink, but you can taste that they never clean their tap lines.   Disgusting place overall. Won't be back.",

It was indeed a delicious snack! I had about 3 mixed drinks & they were okay. The bill was more than it should have been. I could have walked across the street & enjoyed the Bucco game live AND had 3 drinks at the ballpark (ain't cheap!) for the same price.   I've had a dinner here before as well, & it wasn't a meal to brag about or re-do.  All in all, it's a bar, next to PNC Park, with a lot of flatscreen tvs. So if you want to catch a game, with drinks, go for it. Just eat elsewhere.",

The atmosphere is nice, plenty of TV's, very spacious and they have an outdoor area! We actually came back here after the game as well and it was like a whole different place at night. They had a great DJ who played a lot of older songs from the 90's and early 2000's, it was fun to hear something different for a change.They even play the music videos on a few of the TV screens which was really cool. They have an attendant in the bathroom and she was really sweet and helpful but the line can get a bit long.  Overall I had a great time, nice place, good food, drinks are reasonable and the service was great. Definitely recommend and will be back. (I want to test their Sunday brunch)",

If you stop in and Crystal isn't working walk your ass right out that door because there is no reason for you to be in that place.

I didn't get to try the sampler because I had a party of hungry gals that ate it up but said it was yummy. Huge place!",

The bouncer took both mine and my friends ID and said he would return once i got the money for the cover charge. Got the money, went back outside, handed the bouncer my cash, and he said both you and your friend need to be here to get the IDs back. I yelled for my friend, and as she came over, the bouncer said \"how about you just leave\" proceeded to grab my chest and push me out of the doorway. I demanded my money back and said how dare you push a woman. Mind you, he was easily three times my size. I don't know what I did to be pushed, or even laid a hand on at all, but I will not be returning. Even before this unfortunate encounter I have never liked McFaddens. Horrible bar.

The food was typical bar fare priced at a premium. The drinks were nothing noteworthy and also on the pricey side. And the poor waitresses were all dressed in a rather scantily-clad manner, despite the fact that it was like 45 degrees outside that day and they had the doors open (it was so drafty in there that I had to wear my jacket). They do have a lot of TVs, so if your expectations are tempered for food and drink, it's not a bad place to catch a game. We opted to sit at a booth instead of the bar so we had a server. She was attentive and sweet, so that is the one bright spot in an otherwise forgettable experience.",

    "text": "McFadden's was the one place near Stage AE that we'd put off going to, but in all sobriety, I had a commendable pre-concert meal here recently.   Our appetizer, the cream cheese-based Kilmore Quay Crab Dip, was loaded with lump crab meat and baby spinach, making it an ooey gooey mortar for the chewy but crisp garlic pita toast points that were tasty enough to be eaten plain, quite frankly. A similar starter from Thee Olde Place Inn was pleasantly recalled.   In regards to my main course, I did something I have never done before.   When my medium-rare burger came to the table with all the pink and juiciness cooked out of it, I sent it back.  The exchange resulted in a profit of flavor via a luscious, rosy patty that dripped flavor like a honeydew melon. The Steel City Burger giddily defames Primanti Brothers by including a milky cole slaw (instead of a vinaigrette slaw) and peeled french fries (adequately prepared to boot) inside a wrinkled, glossy, soft, buttered bun. Each bite was creamy, crunchy, carnivorous joy.   A helping of housemade, cauldron-crisp potato chips completed the entree for me in sea-salted, can't-eat-just-one, gourmet supermarket fashion. And there was a time when I thought New York Deli's purple bags of chips were the snack food pinnacle. Damn, was I young and sheltered.   Ah! Fashion. Well, I may not recall our server's name, but I do recall that she was dressed like any other gal you'd see walking or jogging about in comfortable athletic attire. Lascivious? Revealing? Inappropriate? Hardly. Furthermore, she was attentive, talkative, and very nice to my girlfriend and I.   I just turned 40, am in a serious relationship, and I liked McFadden's more than I anticipated.   P.S. The joint is as spacious as a fire hall. Throw a bash!   P.P.S. I do agree with other reviewers who stated that the food is a tad overpriced.",

    "text": "I would give my experience here a one star, but the hostess, bartenders, and the wait to sit wasn't bad for a game night. Now given the fact that this establishment was extremely busy and is right next to PNC park, I understand the hectic work environment and amount of patience you must have to endure working in that. So here is my review.    We arrived at a reasonable time to be able to get a table, around 430-5 on a game night. We put our name in, which works of a text message system, and then sat at the bar for a few beers. The place was extremely crowded, but only took a couple minutes to get our drinks. We only had to wait for 30 minutes and then were sat.       Now, even though there was plenty of space to spread the tables out, we were still squeezed between other tables. About 4 other table groups and we were all squashed like sardines. They seemed to have an excuse for EVERYTHING. But anyway. It took a good 5-6 minutes to get the server. We ordered the fried pickle backs, a garden salad with ranch, and the st pattys melt. The fried pickles were more like a fried pickle chopped into small pieces, mind you this was $9!! They were not very good, the sauce it came with was though. I would NOT recommend ordering this.I did inquire about the small portion to the food runner and he said it was because the owner wants them cut like that. Ooook. The salad was huge and the dressing was thick. The sandwich was alright too, but the bead was a little hard or crispy.    The attention we received from the server was very minimal. Once we received our check we did not see our server again. They were setting up for an event where we were seated, so it was a little uncomfortable. Feeling of being rushed and the glares the remaining tables were getting. Another server ended up having to check us out. The bottom of the receipt was hilarious to me, also a little infuriating. Another table laughed as they read it too.    Basically, if your going to come here on a game day, just order drinks from the bar.",

    "text": "We came here on a Friday around 6:30pm before a concert at StageAE. Honestly the main reason we ended up at McFaddens was because all of the other places closer to the venue had 90+ minute waits to be seated. The place was basically empty. The bar seating was pretty full but other than that, only 3-4 tables were occupied in the whole place.   It took about 10 minutes for someone to come over and take a drink order. 10 minutes later the waitress comes with 1 beer, and tells me they are refilling the keg of the Sam Adams summer ale that I ordered. Okay, fine. Another 10 minutes and she comes by and says they're actually out of the summer ale, so I ordered a Summer shandy.   We were waiting for another couple to join us, and by the time they got there, my boyfriend was just about finished with his beer while I still hadn't even received mine. The waitress promptly came over to take their drink orders (they got the special which was $4 bud light bottles.. Not much of a special really) and asked me if I wanted the special too. Pretty sure she totally forgot about my summer shady.   Took about 10-15 minutes for her to come back with the rest of our drinks. We figured we better order while she was there.   We ordered chicken sandwiches and wraps. The food was fine, nothing to rave about (other than the fact that I ordered grilled and she gave me fried chicken). I'm not sure if our waitress was horrible or if the place was understaffed. It did look like she was switching between hostess, bartender and waitress.   Overall, great place to watch a game. Great location. Food is just average, as well as the prices. Service was poor from my one experience.",

There was absoutely no reason for it.  It isn't a dance club at 5:30 in the afternoon. You are trying to eat a meal and have to shout to actually talk to your dining companions.  They were clearly targeting men with the way the servers were all dressed.  Two of them were actually showing butt cheek.  Our server was very attentive until she noticed that the three guys with us all had wedding rings on.  Then she was basically MIA for most of the evening.  We saw the shot girls and miller light girls more than we saw our server.  Food was mediocre at best.  I didn't expect anything outstanding, but it was clear most of the items were purely frozen items that were reheated.  We waited quite a bit (but they were busy) but two people's orders were cold. It was pretty obvious it had been out for a while and the server didn't pick it up for whatever reason.  Perhaps the most egregious thing was the prices.  I get it is a bar near the stadiums, so the entree prices were high but not unacceptable.  However, I asked for extra celery and was told there would be a $3 charge.  Three dollars for four pieces of celery?!  Extra blue cheese was also insanely over priced.  Most places will give you celery for free or maybe charge fifty cents.  But three dollars?!  And when I questioned the price the server said \"does that mean you don't want it?  It's not that expensive\"  If you are a 21-25 year old single male, maybe you would enjoy this place.  Otherwise, stay away.",

The bartenders drink WAY more than the customers. The food is OKAY but overpriced. The general atmosphere can be fun until you get your drink kicked over and hand stepped on by people \"dancing\" on the bar. But the most disgusting part about this visit was the foot-long beard hair this bartender managed to get in my drink. How is that even possible?!? The short, tattooed one is dragging his facial hair through everything. He is practically tripping on it. Please have your employees wear a beard net!",

It was a busy post Steeler's pregame day, so I expected slow service and that isn't affecting my rating.  I asked the hostesses for a table for one.  They replied I should go to the bar, despite a few open tables behind them.  I walked around the entire bar, not a single seat available.  I went back to the hostesses, who begrudgingly showed me to a small two top, and took away the 2nd chair.  ODD.   I ordered the fried provolone cheese triangles & the Yinzer Diet (Steak Salad).  The appetizer never came, my salad was served, and I had to tell my server the app never came and request it be taken off the bill.  She said she had to ask the manager!  I waited 30 minutes for her to return with my correct bill.  I didn't tip, for the first time in my life.  Usually, I tip %20 for even mediocre service.  The food is underwhelming and the drinks overpriced.  $9 for a Smirnoff Moscow Mule.  I won't be back & unless you want a rowdy bar for game day drinks, skip McFadden's.",

It gets pretty dirty when there is a big crowd, which is to be expected.. but they don't do a great job at cleaning up as the night goes on. The floor is always the stickiest floor I've been on.

I've been in line and have seen it go from $5-$15 as the line got longer! I guess the two nice things are...it's huge, lots of space to move around and they have an outside area. Honestly there's not much else to say. Typical sports bar, nothing special but I'll continue to visit when going to games.",

Apparently he just finished his shift working as a nurse. I was impressed, not only with that but with the turkey hoagie which was AMAZING. The manager, Tyler, stopped over to check on me and told me that the turkey is smoked in-house!  I would definitely go back here the next time I'm in town.",

I ordered the potato pancakes, and the McFaddy MacDaddy. Josh got the 24/7 burger.   So, it is positively obvious that they have one cook, with access to a microwave and a deep fryer. Everything flew out of the kitchen in less than 10 minutes.   The pancakes were misleading in the menu, making it seem like they were going to be somewhat homemade, or an amazing version that you wouldn't be able to tell that a big truck brought in a month ago. I digress. They were sad little pucks. But, salted and served with creole seasoning mixed with sour cream, they kind of redeemed themselves.   Burgers. I love burgers. But these only came over cooked, and mine, with mac and cheese was just plain pasta with a slice of cheese plopped on top of it. The bacon was off the hook, though.  Josh's burger was all kind of heart disease friendly. Egg, bacon, meat, and syrup. He liked it. But he likes everything.   Service is amazing. They paid attention to us all evening, even though we weren't boozing like the rest of the crowd. So, it's probably a better place to drink, than eat.   Happy Eating!",

    "text": "I ate at this establishment for the first time last night and had one of the worst meals in recent memory.  I had mahi mahi, which was described as teriyaki style, but was served drenched in overpowering AllBay seasoning with teriyaki sauce. Hard to believe anyone actually thought those flavors intentionally belonged together. It was awful. My dining companion had the smoked turkey/pulled pork, which was fine but both of us were served a pile of bland overcooked 100% brocolli (and maybe cauliflower) stems as the veggie...not a single crown, along with a scoop of horribly oversalted mashed potatoes.  I realize it is a pub, not a fine restaurant, but this was truly memorable for how bad it was.  PS I also sent them feedback via their website and they didn't even bother to respond. Given their built in sports crowd it would seem they couldn't care less about customer satisfaction.",

    "text": "Worst service I've ever gotten. Barely any alcohol in any of my friends or my drinks. And, worst of all, an ex-bartender who worked there tried to hit on my friends and I. When we rejected him, he dropped his drink by accident then laughed, dropped ours, then told the \"security\" or guy workers that it was our fault and got us all kicked out! The one man grabbed my neck and led me outside, forcing me to stand in 24 degree weather while I waited for my friends. I pleaded to at least stay in the vestibule and he refused. Unbelievable, disrespectful and unnecessarily cruel. They treat women like shit, pleading for them to dance on bars because \"our parents won't find out\". Trust me, my mom is all about me being sexy, but not me being taken advantage of by power hungry, domineering men. Gross! Dont go there. There are no hot men to hit on anyway.",

    "text": "I had to plan a bachelor party in Pittsburgh without ever having actually been there, and McFaddens saved my butt.  We wanted to find a bar that would allow us somewhat of a 'private event' for a few hours on Saturday afternoon, and McFaddens was the perfect choice.  The staff was super helpful both during the planning stages and during the actual event.  The prices were very reasonable and the food and drinks were exactly what we asked for.  The crowd was barely picking up by the time we left, but we interacted with some of the locals and it seemed like a cool place to hang out.  I don't know what midnight on a Friday is like, but if you're planning a small gathering and want you and your guests taken care of in impeccable fashion, I'd highly recommend McFaddens.",

    "text": "This place is new since I last lived in Pittsburgh - it's huge!  But totally one of those big, canned, Irish bars.  It was relatively empty this snowy Friday afternoon - and service was slow.  There were a couple special requests, nothing outlandish, that they just couldn't get right.  They do have a \"build a hoagie/salad\" checklist, which was ok.  For a Catholic during lent, it was hard to find anything without meat - or without fries or cheese, for those watching their figures.  I got a sub with portobello, roasted reds, onions, oil & vinegar.  It was dry and the mushrooms were salty.  The chips however, were amazing!  Homemade with a hint of BBQ.  I'm not a big fan of chips, but for some reason, I couldn't stop eating them!",

    "text": "This place is an embarrassment of a business. It's such as shame that such a great location is going to waste. This past week my friend made a reservation for a going away party and when we arrived they did not have us \"in the book\" and acted clueless instead of resolving the issue in a professional manner. Then I came here for happy hour and searched for a hostess of waitress and could not find one so we sat ourselves on the patio. We waited 20 minutes before realizing no one was going to wait on us, even though an employee, wearing McFaddens shirt, was hanging out with his friends at a nearby table and clearly saw us waiting. Once we got up and went to the bar the waitress took our drink orders, claimed she'd be back for our food orders AND NEVER RETURNED. Even though she was standing right in front of us. Did I mention we were 2 of 8 people at the restaurant? We waited 15 minutes while her and the other server (who was wearing shorts where her buff cheeks were exposed) sat on their phones and hugged the same male employee who ignored us earlier. After finally waiting to the point of being annoyed we spoke up and ordered our food and returned to our outdoor table. Only for the server with the short shorts to come over and ask for our order again because the other waitress did not remember it. Our food finally arrived, no one asked us if we wanted water or any more drinks and they never checked on us again. When we were done we returned to the bar to check out and the waitresses were obviously intoxicated and dancing on the bar... at 7:30 on a Monday with 6 other people at the bar. The male worker then attempted to get us to tip well while checking out by apologizing for everything being \"crazy\" and offered us water... As we were walking out. This location is in an amazing spot and I used to think highly of this bar. Now it's just a disgusting excuse for a business with lazy employees. You're paying them to drink while customers basically serve themselves. It's no wonder there were so few people there. I will never return or recommend it to anyone. And to think I almost payed a $10 cover charge after a Pirates game makes me sick. $10 for your employees to get drunk and \"work\", no thanks.",

Good atmosphere lots of young people as it turned out a bus load from Morgantown West Virginia had came down to party.  All and all a decent scene, had fun and met alot of other people from out of town.  Everyone was pretty wasted and there was lots of dancing going on with all the college kids.",

    "text": "If there were negative stars I'd have to use them for the lunch service.  I work next door and our internal cafe shut down forcing us to find food in the neighborhood.  There's seldom more than 10 customers in the huge pub at lunch.  With that many customers you'd think that they could serve up a salad pretty quick wouldn't you?  Well don't get your hopes up.  For a salad that is a decent size you have to wait long enough that the cook could have harvested the contents from a victory garden, in the next county!    The wait staff is perfect for something like a bachelor's party but if that's what you're looking for you might as well go to Hooters.  The foods faster and the atmosphere isn't trying to be something it's not.    As an Irish Pub the only thing they've gotten right is the name.  The food's not Irish, The Guiness is flat and the Bar keep looks at you funny if you ask for a Black and Tan.  Since when did a \"Blue Moon\" become a staple at an Irish Pub?  The people are friendly though, I hope they get better management so they can become a True Irish Pub.  You can never have enough of them.",

The food was fine, once it came and was correct. The service was mostly bad-but was done with a smile. We went before a Pirates game on a Tuesday evening, expecting a crowd but it really wasn't overly crowded. The young lady seating us went out of her way to get us a table. That was about the end of the good service, unfortunately. We waited for 10 minutes before our presence was even acknowledged by our \"waitress\", when she said she would be right back. Another 5 minutes or so go by and she finally comes back to take our orders. It took 10 more minutes just to get our drinks.  Our appetizer never came, and one (out of two) orders was not right when the food did get served...35 minutes later. It was hot and pretty good. But sorry, a fried fish sandwich and a burger shouldn't take 35 minutes. Add on to that the fact that another drink was ordered, which also never came. And BTW-the drinks were just coke.",

    "text": "We went to McFadden's on a semi busy summer Sunday (not football season).  We (4 people) were seated and not greeted for 10+ minutes.  When we were greeted (because we flagged a waitress down who had walked by us at least a dozen times) we asked, \"are you are server?\"  her response was \"Yah.\".  Nothing else but silence..Awkward. So we ordered our beers which took at least 8-10 minutes to receive.  We knew we were in trouble on time, so we immediately placed our order when she returned. Easy as pie:  4 side salads all ranch and two order of 'boneless wings'.   1 HOUR LATER: \"Oh your food is in the window and don't worry my managers taking care of it\"  then 10 more minutes roll by..we order more beers but they never show.  Finally our food arrived.  Salad was sub par at best,  but the wings ($11 an order) were chicken fingers, NOT wings and tasted worse than ANYtizers you buy in the frozen food section.  Worst, worst, WORST.  We got our checks and realized she put $8 beers on our tabs that no one had ordered.  We didn't have time to care at that point since our dinner and check process took over an hour and 45 minutes so we just paid and left.  P.S. don't plan on having a conversation because they blast music to the point where their speaker system is crackling.  I would never recommend this place.  Figure it out, McFadden's.",
