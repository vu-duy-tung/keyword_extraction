She loved everything she could get her hands on and seemed to feel very comfortable in the space.  The owners and staff were wonderful and very welcoming.  They mentioned that they intend to add traditional chinese entertainment on weekends in the near future.  I am looking forward to it since it will make them more than just a place to eat!  Many of the dishes were unique and their attention to detail was very good.  Some of the dishes were a little oily for my taste but overall a good time was had by one and all!",

    "text": "This place has gone through many name and I'm assuming ownership changes, but it's always been a Chinese buffet. I'd say this is the worst iteration of it that I've seen at this location. The food is average and somehow they stripped all of the character and comfort from the place. It's so bare and uncomfortable in there. You eat in a giant plain room full of tables. There wasn't any music playing, so it was eerily and weirdly quiet. It's like a school dining hall or something. I don't know. Really hard to explain. I wouldn't judge it so hard if I hadn't known how it has looked in the past. Why did they change it so much and make it so bare? I'm focusing a lot on the ambiance here, but the food is pretty average. They seem to do a good job of keeping it all hot, so that's always a positive. There are a few sushi selections and the typical odds and ends you come to expect from a Chinese buffet. It isn't anything memorable, but it isn't the absolute worst either.",

A lot of it looked like it was sitting out for awhile so I grabbed what looked fresh. I took a bite of everything off my plate and was so dissatisfied by all of it that I had them take away my plate and waited until my check came. The buffet was way over priced for how awful it was and the manager was completely unprofessional when I informed him how bad my experience was and how I wanted to resolve it. He was VERY RUDE and gave off the impression that he wasn't even a manager from how he was dressed and the dirty looks he was giving. Quote \"Go eat somewhere else then\". Never again!",

The buffet was mostly standard fair but it was very fresh and hot. The fish was amazing, as was the other seafood. We tried to try a bit of everything, but because of the wide variety it was impossible. The cubes of beef were a little tough and needed to be cooked either shorter so they were tender or longer to soften to falling apart.Some more vegetables would be  nice. Next time I'm going to try the sushi and the hibachi, I just didn't have the room to give it a try because I also had the deserts. Two of us ate to our hearts content for only $3617. My friend made up a takeout for her daughter and that was the same price of 16 or so dollars.",

I went by the most recent reviews and said I'll give it a chance. Wrong decision! I basically tried something of everything hoping to find something good. Have you ever been to somewhere where cold shrimp with cocktail sauce is bad? I hadn't before this visit. The cocktail sauce was like 5 gallon bucket ketchup with one teaspoon of horseradish. Everything seemed room temperature. The best thing I ate was the clear jelly thing with some purple something in it. Searched it online and it looked NOTHING like it said it was suppose to. The server didn't bring us any other drinks after the check was brought. The check arrived 5 minutes after we sat down. I was coming back with my first plate and it was there. Please just save yourself wasted time and go somewhere else. This was one of the worst meals I have ever eaten and it pained me to pay the $37 for the meal. Never again!",

I moved further away so have not been back since it changed its name until today. Anyway, the place before the name was changed was not like this... their buffet used to be excellent, and the sushi were all fresh! They had the sushi chefs right there making them, and the other items on the buffet tables were also fresh and tasty. Today, I was sorely disappointed. Clearly this is under a new ownership, and their business model and philosophy are completely different; the chefs are obviously different. The foods were salty and very greasy, and some tasted old! The only reason I am not giving a one star but giving two stars is because the waitstaff were nice and took my dirty plates right away. One of the worst Chinese buffets I have yet experienced, very disappointed. The sushi were not fresh, I felt sick afterwards. I thought it was weird that the place was not packed like it used to be when I walked in. Now I know why!",

However went tonight, and dare i say, from the sushi to the main dishes, Its actually gotten better! Almost as if the first run was to get the feet wet.  Food was tasty, and they kept it clean and full. Most of the usual suspects you would find on the buffet line, with a few surprises, but all in all, a great experience. Even my daughter, the queen of picky eaters made a few trips. I usually top off at 2 plates, little of my favorites, and finish with soup, This go, i had to try everything. wasn't disappointed.   They even had \"Tarot Cake\" back in the Dim sum (Gong Xi Fa Cai!) to which my wife wouldn't touch just due to the look. Lol. Its delicious. Try it while ya can, before it goes away post New years ;)  Service is always very friendly and fast, and they're getting busier. Happy to see a place i like picking up steam! (No pun intended.)  As others mention, it is a bit open feeling with the table lay out, but almost feels like a work in progress after a new opening. Small changes from the last few times. Not sure what the stage is there for, LOL, but the TV does offer a bit of Music. Atmosphere would be my only ... not complaint, but eh, it doesnt bother me though ;)",

Many items were not hot or even warm. Others weren't cooked or were still partially frozen. Ice cream was decent, but there's always Dairy Queen. The total for two people for dinner & pop = $37.88. We've had better food for the value at gas stations. Best part of the night -- seeing the kitchen staff order in pizza (picture posted to prove it).",

I waited a few weeks since the grand opening to eat here, because there are inherently kinks to work out anytime a new business opens.    I came for dinner on Christmas Eve, and the place was quite busy.  At least half the patrons there were Asian Americans, which in my experience is the best telltale sign of the authentic nature and quality of the food.  This was exactly the case.    The food exceeded my expectations, and I think it tops the quality of the food of the large one on the other side of town near the Waterfront.  Food was piping hot, and the entire place was very clean (including the restrooms).    I tried a little bit of virtually every offering, minus sushi, salad bar, and hibachi.  Not a single thing disappointed me.  After probably 8 or 9 plates, I left very full, but not queasy at any point that night or the next day.  They have my trust and my future business, for sure.  I am glad to have this lovely new asset in the North Hills, close to home.  See you in the new year!",

In the future when this place closes maybe a good place will open   The crab they served would have made you sick it looked 5 days old. Instead of filling the bins a lady walk around just stirring what was left. We were there just after 2 pm and it should have been well stocked. There is 2 small buffets with 20 things and most of the food was good. This place could not fill 2 bins with good food. I could go on all day and have nightmares all night about it.",

All of the buffet items were cold and the hibachi sauce was AWFUL. I couldn't even eat it and I felt bad for wasting it. Then I moved on to desert- cream puffs were hard. The ice cream selection was super basic (prior to being under this new mgmt there was red bean and green tea ice cream, and that's why it was one of my favorite cheap spots before it changed over. Food was way better too).   The weirdest thing I saw there was there waiting area for when they got busy........ I don't know why, but I feel as though vehicle seats in a restaurant should be against some kind of code or policy somewhere",

I started off with some raw oysters which were pretty good last time I had them here, but this time they were part frozen and had a weird chemical smell. Maybe just a bad supplier? I set those aside and tried some other things, but they were off too. The sauces were all excessively sweet and heavy. The fish for the sushi looked pale and dry suggesting it had been frozen then soaked in water. There were only a couple dishes such as the steamed fish with ginger and scallions that were properly cooked and as good as they've previously been. The bathrooms were also filthy and obviously hadn't been attended to in quite a while.  Sad to say I'm crossing this off my list and not coming back until I hear it's improved and/or under new management.",

There are also mini van seats in the waiting area for some reason. Will say that the staff were very friendly and attentive.  The lack of music gave it a creepy feel.  However, the food simply was not good. Lack of flavor and you can tell the food has been sitting under a lamp all day.  Did not try the sushi because the freshness was questionable. The hibachi inside was a nice touch and better than anything else sitting out there. They also have ramen that you can pick your own ingredients.   TLDR: you're in a major city. There are better places to eat.",

Admittedly, I did not expect much because this restaurant is tucked away in a shopping complex that has a bunch of big box stores, but I'm so glad I made the journey to try it. When we first walked it, my fiance and I were immediately impressed by how clean the buffet was. The counters were immaculate, the sushi neatly arranged, and the trays fresh and colorful.   The cleanliness was one of the biggest things that stood out to me. I've been to dozens of asian buffets and this is one of the cleanest. The wait staff was also exceptional; whenever I went to get another plate, the mess of the previous plate was also cleared before I got back. I had the chance to talk to Joy, who was so kind and amazing at her job.   At $16 per person for dinner, I think the quality and diversity of the food here is truly discounted. What I loved was that all the trays were small -- indicating that they make small, high quality batches at a time for each dish. Also, having smaller trays meant there were so many things to try! While we were there, I was particularly enamored with the blistered yet crispy green beans and they replenished that particular tray faster than I could eat them!  The other thing I really enjoyed was the crab. They literally serve half-crabs here and they are enormous, juicy, and addicting. I was amazed they served crab for only $16/person. They are the only good Asian buffet in the area and I really appreciate the offerings here. They have high quality food, crab, sushi, and a Mongolian bar -- what more is there to say?",

The spicy tuna roll is spectacular, and they have a wide variety of sushi to choose from. A hibachi grill, sushi, many seafood options, a dessert bar, and so many soups. It's so cheap to eat out here to lunch too. Two people is about 25$ I believe. The staff is really nice, and the food is pretty good. I haven't eaten anything from here that I haven't liked. Everything is so fresh too. Nice and hot and you can definitely tell that it's not food that's been sitting out a while. I highly recommend Happy Home Buffet to anyone that's looking to get some Chinese and Japanese cuisine.",

I came here for the special holiday dinner on a Christmas and paid $27 for typical Chinese food and crab legs. I would not say that it was worth the money.   I only had two plates of food and couldn't even finish the second plate fully. I think that speaks volumes since I typically eat 3-5 plates. I wasn't even tempted by their desserts. Although, the ice cream case seemed nice with a wide variety of options.   I'm not sure if this Chinese buffet differs from any others in the area. I definitely prefer Hokkaido over this one. I'd try this place again if I was really craving Chinese food and desperate for a place that was open.",

They have lots of Chinese dishes & dumplings, and several soup options. They have some kids items and American items too like Mac & cheese and chicken nuggets. There is a salad bar & dessert bar with hand dipped ice cream. I was seated immediately & my water was refilled promptly & plates were also cleared promptly. The food was hot.

It's fairly similar to the last two buffet restaurants that have existed in this location. I was glad for the hibachi option, because there were very few vegetables on any of the steam tables besides one dish of green beans with almonds. They were very good, but I wished for more options and variety. Like bok choy!  We tried a variety of the other entrees and they were fine. A little heavy on sauces for my taste, and mostly very well done, which isn't ideal when it comes to beef, or fresh vegetables. Pretty standard buffet fare.  The staff working tonight were very friendly and helpful. Our server was ever present, and was happy to refill our drinks, answer questions and generally be helpful. The same could be said of the kitchen staff who were busy bringing out fresh food throughout our visit.   Overall, we'd probably come here again a few times per year to add some variety to our eating out options, but it's not a standout in terms of local restaurants.",

But the table area where we sat was clean.  The young man and young woman who were our servers were friendly and attentive.  The variety of food was really good.  I've never seen octopus or steamed crabs on a buffet before.  There was a great variety of seafood  Bad - I have no idea how this place gets such good ratings.  Perhaps the seafood is really good - I like seafood, and had the salmon, which was ok.  Didn't try the shrimp because it just didn't look right to me - under heat lamps and limp.  Mostly stuck to the chicken dishes.  The General Tso's chicken was soggy and was more sickening sweet than flavorful and spicy.  The sweet and sour chicken, again, soggy breading and sweet.  Plus, I'm pretty sure that there was a deep-fried neck piece in my serving.  The chicken inside was inedible - dry and very stringy.  The chicken and broccoli was ok - although the chicken was like a sponge.  I had a bowl of chicken broth and some noodles.  When I go to buffets, I will ultimately get a salad, but there were a few iceberg lettuce leaves dried up in a buffet pan so I passed.  I get that it was a Monday and the turnover is probably slow, but for $34 for the two of us was a bit much for such poor quality.  We skipped dessert because none of it looked edible.",
