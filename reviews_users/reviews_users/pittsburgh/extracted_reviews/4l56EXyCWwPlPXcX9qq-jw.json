My father has been going here since he was in high-school, and a trip to Steel Town isn't complete for me without a visit. The picture of Italian Hoagie perfection that this place paints is, quite simply put, the best on the planet.  It is breathtaking...it's like if Leo Da Vinci and Lidia Bastianich had a baby, and that baby created this sandwich in a stroke of weird chef/artist baby-genius.  I salivate like Pavlov's dog when I get within 50 miles of this place.  Always perfectly assembled, with even meat/cheese distribution and proper application of vegetables AFTER toasting, this hulking sandwich is a pleasure to eat even in your Sunday Finest!  Every bite is an explosion of flavor, but I rarely need a napkin.  Nothing should be added to or taken away from the \"Original Hoagie with everything.\"  It can not be improved upon.  Period.  If God ate hoagies, this would be the only one she cared for. And she wouldn't call ahead either...she'd know that they are best fresh out of the oven, and that the wait is never too long. You can never wait too long for a Danny's Italian hoagie. God says so.  And I say so.  And I told God about this place, so there.  The satisfaction I feel after eating a Danny's Italian Hoagie is not unlike what I feel after the best, most opulent holiday meal.  Only I can get that satisfaction any day I want by eating a Danny's Italian Hoagie...imagine that!  It's like crack, only better.  Food crack.  Or maybe food heroin, because once I eat one I want to take a nap!  Nod right out...  They also make pizza.  I've never had it.",

Little did I know then how precious a place Danny's is! The hoagy has a special (secret!)  italian-type dressing that combines just the right amount of moisture with cheese, pepperonis, some kind of ham, salami- but not too much meat to overwhelm the sandwich. Then it is cooked in the pizza oven which I think gives it the perfect toasted texture that adds to its fame. Lettuce, tomatoes and onions are added after the hoagy is cooked. This is an incredible sandwich and like the other poster said, it is addicting like heroin must be LOL. Whenever I visit Pittsburgh I MUST-HAVE-DANNYS-HOAGY and I have gone to the extent of getting one regardless of whether all the meals in my itinerary are planned.",

I chose a topping listed under the regular column, meatballs, and was charged for a premium item.  I called it to the attention of the clerk, who told me that meatballs had been listed in the wrong category on the board and that the $3.30 charge was correct.  Did he offer to refund the dollar?  No, all he did was to offer to change the order.  I declined.  It will be a long time before I return, it ever.  I dislike dishonesty.",

It had tons of grease and was overly soggy. As for atmosphere, I appreciate a good hole-in-the-wall establishment but, cheap paper plates?  If you're going to go, try one of the hoagies and avoid the pizza altogether. Just because a restaurant isn't a chain and is an old building, it doesn't make it a \"hidden gem\".",

The kitchen is open and takes up about half the restaurant. There are a few (5ish) tables by the windows. No rocket science here. Make your selection from the menu board, order at the counter and wait. I chose to go with 2 New York style slices and  a steak hoagie. The slices were $2.15 without toppings. They also have square slices for less available in the late afternoon/evening. I waited for about 15 minutes and took my food to go. The pizza was crispy on the bottom and melty on the top. They add the cheese before warming it up in the oven so no old, sloppy cheese here. The slices were a good size. I also liked that they cut them in half to make it easier to eat. Hubs ate the steak hoagie. He liked it but was nowhere near blown away. Overall, I was a little disappointed in the prices (a tiny bit high for the quality) and the wait times.",

    "text": "Sometimes I want a dinner that busts down barriers, spins convention into dizziness, gives me glimpses into foreign cultures, and flings me into the future.  Other times, I just want a pizza and a hoagie.   Established in 1960, Danny's Pizza has been serving up the standards without shame or an ounce of care for the latest trends. The building is as narrow as a diner car, but the food is a double-wide trailer full of Italian/American quick-serve classics straight from the blackened griddle, the deep-fryer, and the oven. Men in white shirts with accents scurry about merrily behind the counter carrying steaming, ballooned calzones around on wooden paddles, flipping sizzling steak flaps about with steel spatulas, and plunging baskets of food into deep-fryers. On an unseasonably humid, hazy, and drizzly December night, Kay and I ventured deep into the south of Pittsburgh for solace of a cheesy and doughy nature.  I had takeout from the no-dine-in Danny's in Baldwin two summers ago, and my experience at this Bethel Park location was similar albeit fresher. The crust of the pizza was akin to a savory danish. Its sauce, while bashfully applied, was bold in flavor. The cheese was laid on more thickly than a salesman's pitch and oozed and slithered in a manner that made it seem animate. The subtle black olives (topping #1) were shouted down by fatty, burly bacon bits (topping #2. they don't offer pineapple in case you are a regular reader and sense that something is amiss) that tasted of real pork, not stale, petrified jerky that dwells in glass shakers or cheap salad bars.   Supposedly, Danny's is famed for their hoagies, and my singular fault about the grinder I had 24 hours ago at this restaurant was that there could and should have been even more delicatessen meat between that baked, oily bun and amidst the ripe, garden-picked vegetables, molten provolone, and vinegary dressing. Protein-pinching aside, Danny's basic hoagies deserve their acclaim.   There's a sense of clarity to Danny's that approaches zen. With the avant-garde and alien overtaking so much of urban Pittsburgh, eateries such as these found in suburban Pittsburgh disentangle the mind and palate, replacing all of that novel, risky clamor with the familiar and dependable, reminding us that there'd be none of this...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoF2uSHEya6Y&s=fb08ace687542cff86ec0497197092da41a1549229370931007edb26badf5919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=oF2u...</a>  ...without that...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0W7fRMSjomo&s=0ef55e1e63eb078c463340bb9bde3b6dd03958710cce0e453b11ef5caed8a613\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=0W7f...</a>",

We ordered a steak hoagie French fries and slices of pizza. The food took a bit of time to cook but that is expected with good food. When it came out they handed us a box for the pizza and a big bag with some boxes in it telling us that all of the food was in there and that we were good to go. We get halfway home and realize the steak hoagies are not in the bag. No biggie.. I live right down the street I'll just turn around and grab them. I go in to let them know I did not get the steaks I paid for and I get told that they are certain that they have them to us. I explain to the employees that I did not have them. The guy at the counter then proceeds to tell the other employee to go and check my car to make sure that the hoagie was not in there before they made me another one. I laughed thinking it was a joke. They actually came out and went into my car. After all of this they did not give me my money back they hurried up and threw another one together and gave me it without a real apology. My fries were then cold and so was my pizza. I spent fifty bucks on nothing.",

I couldn't eat anything yet alone feed my children this mess, so I called and offered them the opportunity to fix the situation and instead of an apology I got a \"golly gee I'll let the cooks know.\"",

    "text": "I would like to apologize in advance. I have not been to Danny's for over 25 years. I don't live there anymore and am giving it 5 stars because of my memories of the place. Between delivering the Pittsburgh Press ,when it cost 67 cents a week, and my stint in the Navy, Danny's was my place of employment. I can't remember how long I worked there. Here is how I remember it: (engage dream sequence here........)  I made hoagies at Danny's. It was a while back. I was 16, I'm knocking on 60 now. The pizzas were made by the full time employees who were all old Italian men. Quite elderly, I am guessing in their 40s . Evidently, they were old family friends of Danny, the owner, who was probably about 30 or 40.  The hoagies were made by the high-school boys; never saw any girls working there. Pay was $1 per hour during the first week, while you were in \"training\". The second week, pay went up to $1.25, and stayed there, forever. You had to punch out at the time clock  for your daily 15 minute break. You got a free pop for your break. NO food.  Saturday was prep day, the day for making a weeks worth of hoagies. Danny's mother worked that day with two selected boys. It was not  perceived as an honor and we were not permitted to speak during the operation.  The construction sequence was: 3 of number 1;    2 of number 2; 3 of number 3; 2 of number 4. Allow me to explain. That is 4 different meats, how many slices of each, and the order they were applied to the just sliced hoagie bun. The bun was rejoined with its other half, installed in a plastic sleeve, twist tied and immediately frozen, to be extracted on a daily basis for the expected demand.  The hoagies were cooked after they were ordered. We opened the bag, opened the roll, squirted some oil/seasoning on the bun, slide them into the oven. They were done when the edges started to blacken. The only option was indicated on the order ticket  \"no number meant  no onions\", or  \"with a  number 9, slap on the onions\".  When things got slow, they sent us out in the parking lot , where everyone ate in their car, to pick up trash. The acceptable and expected way to discard your pizza box, papers, cups, ice and everything else you wanted to get rid of was to simply open your car window and push the mountain of trash through to the ground for us ciggy smoking, pimply teen boys to pick up. No one was expected to get out of their car to place their stuff in a trash can, and no one ever did. After the lot was \"redd up\" (Pittsburgh English) , we  returned to the establishment to construct more hoagies.  At the end of the night, if there was left over pizza, you could take some home. At first, my family would gobble it up. It was quite good. After a few weeks, though, everyone quit eating it.   I always smelled like onions in high school.  There was an old pizza maker there; I think his name was Frank. He had a lisp and it was torture for him to call out  the order numbers to the customers when their food was ready. We used to laugh ourselves silly when he had to call out \"sixes\".  He had number \"666\" one time; we almost had teenage coronaries on that one. He made good pizzas, worked hard and we were a bunch of non sympathetic, unfeeling teenagers. Sorry, Frank.",

Half was more than enough for a meal - bigger than a typical \"Subway- type\" of sandwich and much better. My friend had the standard Philly-style cheesesteak...also delicious. We waited about 20 minutes for our sandwiches (they get a ton of call-in orders so even though it may not look busy, be prepared to wait), but the sub was sooooo worth the delay. Definitely one of the best subs I've ever eaten. Good variety on the menu but not so many choices as to be overwhelming. Next time I'm trying the buffalo chicken hoagie - it also looked delicious!",

The pizza is ho-hum, it reminds me of a frozen, rising crust pizza. Not terrible, but not what I'd hope for with a pizza joint.  Outside seating is a tad loud with the traffic, but the fresh air and green grass more than make up for that, giving you a great spot to sit and munch on your food.

We come from a state where mom and pop pizza shops are on every corner., and they are all good. Pizza is important to us. Danny's pizza is pretty good. The sauce is exactly what I like. The crust is good, but just a little too thick and chewy for us.  Do not order multiple toppings. Pick one or get a specialty pizza. We ordered 4 toppings on a large, not realizing we'd pay over 25 dollars for a pie. They don't skimp on topping, but that's still way too much for pizza.

The bread is crisp and toasty.  The meat is generous and tender.  Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water.  I have been coming here for years and make it a habit to get a hoagie or two every time I visit relatives in the region!  Definitely worth checking out!  Any place that has been open 50 years has to be doing something right!",

Before I get to the sandwiches, I came in with an order for two sandwiches, and coupon for $2 off. The manager had given me this coupon for days beforehand, buy they wouldn't honor it this night. They didn't even tell me that they weren't going to, I added it up in my head and questioned them. They said \"It's too hard to do in the system.\"  I don't know which I'm more upset about, that they wouldn't honor the  four day old coupon, or that they tried to hoodwink me about it. Either way, I'm not coming back to this place.   As for the sandwiches, they were pretty good. The meatball was a little spicy, and might have benefitted from more cheese. The Philly steak was a little plain, and might have benefitted from more spice, but both were defitely worth eating, just not worth a return trip in the context of dishonest counter staff. If you come here, skip the pizza, order the sandwich, and watch your back!",

I've tried to eat there 3 times recently. The first time was a Monday night around 6pm and they were closed! The second time on a Saturday at 5pm I called multiple times and no one answered the phone. I drove there anyway and chance it, they were open. The third time was a Tuesday night at 6:45, guess what, closed again!   I can say that the hoagie that I got on attempt #2 was as good as always. What I don't understand is why the web says open until 9pm and they're closed at 6 and 7pm? I'm getting pretty disgusted with the attempts, are they going to be open or not, how about getting it together?",

They were swamped and understaffed but were pleasant and hustling hard. I was told my food would be ready in 30 minutes, it wasn't. But again, I saw them hustling so I didn't mind. I saw a couple people walk out, discouraged with the wait. I felt awful and wished I could help the staff out. I had planned on leaving a cash tip because I really did appreciate their strong hustle and didn't want it to go unnoticed. But then I saw a woman behind the counter (who may have been the new owners relative that came down to help out - not sure) handling money and scratching her head without washing her hands in between digging through some sandwiches without gloves on. At this point I needed to ask for my money back and left. I did see the woman after this go over and put gloves on. I recognize that there is a learning curve for everything so I will give it another chance in a few weeks and update my review.  The hard work, good attitude, and amazing smell of the place gives me hope that this place will be even better than the original Danny's. So everyone, be patient - when was the last time you were a new business owner reopening a restaurant with high expectations?",

Their menu has expanded to include full size pizzas, calzones, hoagies, and even appetizers. Take out is still available. If you are planning to pay with a credit card please note that anything under $10.00 is subject to $1.00 transaction fee. Anything over is your actual spend.  Remembering they have over sized hoagies I was happy to learn that you could still buy pizza by the slice. Toppings are $.45 extra per choice and some are what they consider premier toppings.  Soft drinks are for sale as well. If you want ice tea you can get it as sweetened, raspberry, or unsweetened. Sorry they have no sugar or sugar substitutes if you want to get it unsweetened. Refills available for a minimal charge.  I order one NY style slice of mushroom and green pepper pizza. They do make their pizzas from scratch and got a small soft drink for just over $5.00. I was told wait time would be 10 minutes and sure enough it was ready as was told me.  A small portion of the bottom crust was burnt but not that bad that would make me want to give it back to them. For one slice this piece was what I would say the size of 2! It was okay. Not as good as I remembered them but still very filling for me.  Last time I was here was a few years back where I had half a hoagie. Bread is very thick and again would recommend only get half if you are not planning to take it home with you.  Danny's shares the entrance to Aldi's grocery store so it can be a bit tricky to get in and out with those customers coming in.Still I had no trouble and was a great chance to revisit memory lane again.",

Unfortunately the new owners have not only lost the dressing formula, and are using inferior ingredients, their manager and staff are also lacking people skills.

I'm perfectly okay with thick crust pizza, but definitely not okay with gooey raw dough beneath my toppings. We had to put it pack into our oven to finish cooking, which kind of defeats the purpose of ordering out, right?  Danny's hoagies are the way to go. I don't recommend the pizza.",

We have also shared pizza which was flavorful, filling and more than enough for 2 people with leftovers to take home. Because the food is made fresh to order, you do have to wait while they make it but it is always fresh from the oven and worth the short wait. This is a great place to order take out.
