    "text": "My fiance and I have been on a quest to find a good italian restaurant in the city of Pittsburgh for some time now. Having almost given up, we decided to check this place out as it is close to our home. Finally found a winner.  We were greeted and seated immediately as we showed up as the dinner rush was winding down. Our waitress, Chrisie, introduced herself with a smile and explained the menu and took our drink order. The decor felt a little like a department store but it wasnt oppressive or very outdated  We ordered the calamari as a starter. The breading was light and well seasoned, and the calamari itself was cooked to perfection. The portion size was more than enough for the 2 of us, and the marinara sauce was homemade, tangy, and perfectly flavored.  We both got wedding soup with our meals. Everything was, again, home made and ridiculously tasty.  I got the Seafood Scroglio with angel hair pasta. The sauce was a little too oily for my liking but everything was perfectly cooked (shrimp,  scallops, and clams), and the pasta was al dente.  My fiance got the chicken parmigiano. The portion was HUGE! The chicken breast was cooked perfectly and was moist, the breading was seasoned and crisp, and the sauce and cheese were fresh.  All and all it was an awesome experience, and I will definately be back again.",

The service we had was exceptional. I wish I could remember the lady's name. Their sauce is so good. I am definitely going to pick up some at a local store now that I see they are selling it.  I had the Chicken Parmigiano which was wonderful and a large, large portion. They happily accommodated my request to have it served over pasta instead of pasta on the side. The New England Clam chowder was excellent and beware their cups of soup are the normal size for a bowl in other places. Garlic Bread that comes with your meal is a large portion too  . Other members of our party had the Spaghetti & Meatballs, Lasagna, Steak Hoagies (All the hoagies  are huge), Buffalo Chicken Salad, Pasta with Malfada Sauce. Everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed their food. Unfortunately we had no room for dessert this time but have tasted their desserts before and they are scrumptious. My leftovers the next day were very tasty. Best of all their prices are really good so we all left feeling very happy. Will definitely return. Nice to have quality food like this in our neighborhood.",

    "text": "A coupon for Carbonara's from one of those local, advert-ridden Town Planner Community Calendars had been nagging at me for months. Further exacerbating my itch, a woman we met at a Clutch concert earlier in the year told us she worked there, urging us come to come over for a spot of food. Last Sunday evening, a beleaguered Kay begged me to order pizza. Remembering the woman and the coupon and realizing I had yet to eat at Carbonara's, we placed a takeout order, whisking through Dormont, Mount Lebanon,  and back to Beechview.   The ticket was good for a free white pizza with the purchase of two large pies, toppings and other extras notwithstanding.   I caught sight of the fellow Clutch fan as we awaited our food, but she was busy with patrons at the bar and was likely too buzzed the night of the aforementioned show to remember us, I imagine. So we let her be.  The dining room was bustling with middle-aged and elderly customers as expected. Booth seats resembled leather couches, and overall, the decor looked somewhat unfinished. Teen and twentysomething servers skipped about, trying hard to stay on top of demand and seemingly succeeding. Welcome to Shoppin' Center Suburbia on a South Hills Sunday evening.   Each pizza, from the small white, to the two colossal regulars were centered around a crust that felt like a cracker on the outside and sourdough bread on the inside. Other analogies that come to mind are flatbreads and pita. The sauce was miniscule, stingy even, but the lardy, party-hearty provolone (not mozzarella) was in abundance, forming strands with each pull from the teeth. The toppings for each were all fantastic. Be it bacon, olives, mushrooms, pepperoni, or tomato, none of them were swept up in the mix. The mushrooms were fresh, the bacon seemed cooked to order, and the tomato slices were straight from a backyard garden. The white pizza, however, with its garlic, olive oil, and grated Romano, stood out from its other behemothic brothers with its confident flavor profile. Had the sauce been more plentiful, these dough saucers would have soared to a 5 with no turbulence encountered.   Dessert for me was a breezy, angelic, coffee-soaked primer on Tiramisu. Espresso-dusted, the cube of mascarpone was elegantly mousse-like, burying the pappy ladyfingers beneath in off-white luxury with hints of liquor subverting inhibitions slightly. It was fit for the opera.   Here you have it, ladies, germs, foodies, and snobs, your quintessential, no-frills Italian-American family restaurant. Enjoy the 22 year-old Carbonara's for what it is and for what they do or kiss a bull's ass.",

It was clearly boxed pasta and not homemade, so why so stingy? I'm surprised there are such high reviews on here actually as my experience and my family's experience wasn't great. I guess it's a decent place for families, but I would definitely go to a different Italian restaurant if you're looking for good food.",

It was a Sunday afternoon and i was surpised when we pulled it it was not crowded. i was actually concerned they were closed. the few people that came in after us did the same thing at the door stopping to look at the hours.  Inside was clean and nothing special. Pop music playing on the speakers, odd choice for an Italian restaurant on a Sunday, but ok. We ordered spaghetti for the kids, and chicken parm for my husband and i.  the waitress was super nice and took our orders, and then brought a tiny loaf of garlic bread to the table. ok not a loaf, but you know what comes out of the stouffers box, 2 half slices of that. for 4 people?!  the kids at that right up.  then our food came. the kids liked the spaghetti, i tried it, nothing special, not much flavor to the sauce. I took one bit of my chicken parm and was horrified. it was like rubber. rubber!! i was so grossed out. now i will admit i am picky, so i my husband tried it too. he will eat anything. he could not finish chewing it.  we told the waitress and she took it away.  she came back with another one, which was good, but i admit i had no stomach after the first round. it was very expensive, and we were not impressed. we will not be going back.  i don't even think it was worth a second try.",

    "text": "This is, sadly, my first negative Yelp review and I have an extensive history as a lead bartender, lead server / trainer, cook and restaurant manager.  I went for dinner this evening and the entire visit was disappointing.  After ordering our meals at the table, I stopped by the bar to get a drink and check the televisions.  I ordered a Sambuca and the bartender did not immediately know what it was.  She asked the other bartender who advised her to ask me if I wanted white or black.  I responded white, but was poured black.  It was slightly loud, but I believe she repeated white as the woman to my left even heard me say it.  Paid for it and insisted on drinking the black as it was busy and she may not have heard me.  Not enough to even be upset about.  Next, I had ordered wedding soup as I have several times before.  This time, it was almost all spinach and very bland.  Still, not too bothered.  My chicken marsala had arrived and the chicken was chewy and severely overcooked.  Still was not going to say  anything.  Then, the proverbial straw.  I had noticed Sam Adams Winter on tap while I was in the bar and ordered one as our meals arrived.  Several minutes later, our server returned with an amber coloured beer.  Before she even placed it on the table, I told her that this was not the beer I ordered.  She left the table and within moments returned with the same glass of beer and said she was told, presumably by one of the bartenders, that this was Sam Winter.  I told her Sam Winter was dark and this was definitely some form of wheat or white beer, probably the Sam Spring.  She scoffed as she asked me if I wanted it or not.  I said no and she walked away with no apology and even showed signs of being upset.  As we were almost finishing our meals, she returned and told me that it was, in fact, the Sam Adams Cold Snap I had said it was earlier.  This entire back and forth led me to write this review.  It seems that the food quality has fallen as has the service and especially the bar staff.  As a highly experienced bartender, I can understand not being able to tell the visual difference between different light beers, but to not be able to notice that a white or wheat beer is being poured instead of a darker bock or lager is beyond unacceptable.  Even much more unacceptable is to return to the table with the same beer I returned once and telling me it is what I ordered.  I highly doubt I will ever give this restaurant another chance.",

Good for people watching. I listened to two elderly gentlemen discuss teenage drivers and how they still had their permits from the 1950's while I waited. I decided to go with the chicken parmesan lunch special. It came with a soup or salad and I chose the salad. Typical iceberg with onion and tomato. I was surprised by the garlic bread that was brought out with my salad. Old school garlic bread on a hoagie bun but super yummy! The chicken parm was a very big portion for lunch but the flavors were simply okay for me. Their homemade sauce did not blow me away. The chicken was a fried chicken breast. Service was fine.   Overall, I doubt that I will go back as there are several other Italian restaurants within 15 minute drive that I feel have better flavors.",

When we arrived to pick up the food I was told that without printing out the coupon it couldn't be honored. There's no expiration, bar code etc, & the coupon itself made no mention that it must be printed out to be honored, nor did the person who took my order. She actually had the nerve to tell me I could drive home, print it out & return & then they would apply it. What a joke! I guess reducing a $75 check by $6-7 bucks didn't make business sense to them. I thought it might just be a waiteess having a bad night, so I emailed the owner & never got a response back. With about 100 choices for Italian in the area I won't be back.",

When I paid my hefty check, a middle-aged man whom I believe is a co-owner who handled the transaction, could not have been more disinterested.  He did not look at me, did not smile, and worst of all, did not say \"thank you\".  I cannot imagine treating a customer with disdain in a restaurant that I owned. On both occasions that I have dined there, no manager or owner came to the table to ensure satisfaction, something which is found in many of the most successful restaurants. Apparently the restaurant is too busy for simple courtesies to be offered.  It leaves a sour taste in my mouth and makes it less likely that I will return soon.",

If you order anything with marinara, it arrives in a pool of water. There is no seasoning to anything- marinara tastes like pureed tomato's, breaded food has zero salt, other sauces are just oil or butter with requisite other ingredients but zero else. I've wondered if it is due to the aged population/customers and it definitely has its fans; I'm not one of them after a decade of visiting and with the other options around within a few miles. It seems a rip-off to me.",

I can't speak much about the menu as I only ordered a small plain pizza, which admittedly was pretty good. Other folks has the tossed salad, pizza soup and an Italian hoagie. The hoagie looked like it was pretty good.  Is definitely come back to try some of their pastas.

We used to come here late 90's, we really liked it but forgot about the little authentic Italian place for a while.  We went there tonight to celebrate my moms birthday, our server was Krista. She was awesome, she was around asking for drink refills, how everything was, but not too much that it was annoying. We really appreciated that, ask for her!   The atmosphere was nice, it started getting busy around dinner time but it wasn't loud at all. We were able to talk and have a good time without having to yell across the table.   As far as the food, we ordered some apps, pizza, lasagna and a few other pasta dishes and almost everything was delicious. The home made lasagna was my favorite! It was so hot and cheesy, perfection! The pizza wasn't the best, it could have been cooked a little longer.   The tab came to just under $100 which, at first, seems high but we had 2 apps, 4 entrees, a few beers and a piece of tiramisu.   Loving this place more and more!  PS. Try the wedding soup!",

My dining partner enjoyed his $13 plate of rigatoni, but when he wakes for more bread, the server said it wound be $.75 extra.  To add insult to injury, the bread was not only nothing special, it was hard.  My garden salad was mostly white iceburg lettuce, flat dressing...not impressed.

    "text": "Parting ways from what had been our local go-to Italian restaurant for takeout or dining in. The owner was very rude to me on the phone and in person last week regarding their website advertised weeknite buy one entree get one entree half off. I never would treat a customer the way he treated me, especially knowing my family and I frequented his restaurant so often. Months back they didn't honor the savings and I let it slide. But to be disrespected by the owner - no. Fortunate to have been introduced by the best caterer in PGH to Gianna Via's in Caste Village.",

Ordered calamari as an appetizer as I looked at the menu and it came out instantly..... really right away. I figured it was already made and just sitting there or it wasn't done. The answer was B, not done. Breading falling off and the calamari itself was tough and under done. Ordered the angel hair pasta with marinara sauce. The noodles must have been made a long time earlier and been sitting in hot water the whole time. Way over done, kind of pasta mush. The sauce was absolutely flavorless. Nothing resembling an herb or spice or seasoning had been anywhere near it. Tomato sauce out of a can would have some taste. Remarkable. Anyhow everyone was very nice and they seemed rather busy but I don't think I'll go back.",

My table got a variety of dishes and appetizers including wedding soup, salad, mozz sticks, banana peppers, chicken parm, Italian hoagie, and margarita pizza.  The ranch that came with the salad and mozz sticks was bad and obviously not house made.  The chicken parm tasted overly breaded and didn't have a lot of flavor.  The stuffed peppers also had little flavor and tasted dry.  The wedding soup was one of the better things we had.   The best dishes we had were the mozzarella sticks, Italian hoagie, and margarita pizza.  The pizza was cooked perfectly and had pretty good flavor.  Again though, while they were good, nothing really made you want to come back.  I have had the wings on a previous occasion and they are actually very good.  I wish I would have got those again.",

She would talk about people and run back to a hostess working and talk about customers just was not a great place which I'm sad for I like real Italian food and this just wasn't it.

The one thing saving this place was how nice our server was. I really wanted wedding soup however the soup comes with beef meatballs. When she saw I was disappointed (I do not eat beef), she brought me the soup and had picked out all of the meatballs. So nice and very appreciated!",

The owner rudely mocked my question and acted like it was funny.  Very offensive.  On top of that, the food was, at best, average.  I had ravioli drowned in tart tomato sauce with a boring salad that included lettuce, onion and a hard tomato slice...nothing else.  We shared an unremarkable calamari appetizer.  Even if the owner hadn't been rude, I wouldn't go back.  I hate to spend $45 for a boring meal.  There are just too many much better options...Pasta Too for example.",

Not really.   As with most Italian American restaurants, the portions were huge. So huge, that the hubby and I split an order of veal parm and it was enough to fill us. Our entree came with a side of pasta and a salad, which weren't too memorable, but were satisfying nonetheless.   Given the distance from me, I will probably order from here again. However, I don't think I'll ever really have a craving for Carbonara's.",

It came with a tossed salad, which was just..meh, and garlic bread.   The salads definitely need updated. It was just lettuce, shaved carrots, 2 slivers of pepper, and a tiny ring of white onion. The house italian lacked flavor. I'd try a different dressing.    The meatballs were a good size and the marinara was chunky and delicious. The rigatoni was perfectly al dente.  The garlic bread was standard.  The kids Mac and cheese was very good! Wish it was on the adult menu! The four year old went crazy for it.   The fried zucchini was amazing.   Steak hoagie was really good, after adding the horseradish sauce.   We didn't get dessert but will definitely try it next visit. :)    The service was very friendly and efficient. Very happy I now closer. I'll visit more!",
