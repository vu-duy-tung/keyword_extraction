We started off with the Thai Corn Chowder and the Rock Shrimp Tempura- both were great, but I'm still thinking about the crispy yet light shrimp that I couldn't stop eating. The soup was a welcome departure from most lackluster restaurant soups, and was rich and creamy. We followed up with the Double Tuna Roll, which was nothing short of amazing. The fish was so fresh it was buttery, and was deliciously dusted with crispy tempura dust. Our main course, the Tandoori Salmon, was a bit of a letdown; we were promised a medium rare salmon that was served to us *very* well-done, and was seriously lacking in any sort of \"tandoori\" flavor. The lentils and raita sauce served on the side were the saving grace for this dish, making it both palatable and delicious. We were too full for dessert, but the creme brulee is on my list for next time!",

    "text": "I'm usually a fan of what Big Burrito does around Pittsburgh, yet I can't fully recommend Soba to the Asian food enthusiast. While the space and service warrant a 4.5 star rating, one can summarize most dishes as high quality yet forgettable rip-offs.  Not that this designation makes sense or anything at this point, but read on. I'm not going to go into the details of the dishes I ate, as they probably won't be on the menu in the near future. Soba's seasonality is something that makes it stand out, and I appreciate the sourcing of the ingredients. Speaking of the ingredients, everything is a rather high quality, which is to be expected at the price point. My scallops were deliciously meaty and sugar sweet, and my vegetarian dining companion's vegetables all tasted quite fresh. The rhubarb in my desert had a perfectly tangy, subtly sweet flavor. Proteins and veggies stand out.  But the dishes, as a whole, don't warrant the price point. Soba tries to communicate subtlety in flavoring of its food, and it carries this principle of subtlety a bit too far. In fact, the food ends up being on the slightly bland, underseasoned side more often than not. For example, the broth in my entree tasted only vaguely of the soy and ginger promised, and my friend's red curry exhibited anemic spicing. Flaws in execution are similarly prevalent; my noodles and my friend's rice were too mushy. Such flaws didn't detract too heavily from the dining experience, but when I'm paying $70+ (appetizer, dinner, dessert, and drink) for a meal I'm expecting complex flavor and texture contrasts, deft seasoning, and meticulous technique. To that end, Soba fails. The meal was fairly enjoyable, and perhaps I went on an off night, but my sticker shock for good but not great food has yet to subside.",

Second, the main entree had some improperly prepared pho noodles....under cooked and quite hard and clumpy....however, upon request an additional serving of properly prepared pho was provided.  Aside from those issues...the four course meal was excellent.",

    "text": "Dude.  Pittsburgh.  Who knew you had such a refined and sexy dining scene???  Well, your good citizens, that's who.  Which is how husband and I were referred to Point Brugge, Salt of the Earth, and lastly Soba Lounge, thanks to the brilliant hostess at our B&B who told us Soba was her favorite spot within walking distance.  I don't usually dine without Yelping these days, but I am *so* glad we recklessly heeded her advice.  Our meal at Soba was one of the finest, most delicious, and wholly satisfying that I can recall (joining Salt of the Earth, no less, in that prestigious category...).  The subtle lighting and modern decor of the joint is coolly lovely, setting the mood right away for a relaxed dining experience.  Attentive, professional service is provided by servers who explain that most of the produce used in Soba's dishes is locally sourced and are happy to make recommendations.  Husband and I started out with an Asparagus Maki Roll appetizer, with tempura asparagus, tamago, roasted local shiitakes, scallion, and a spicy lemon ponzu.  The soft, sticky rice didn't overwhelm the crunchy asparagus, earthy 'shroom, and slightly-sweet tamago; the ponzu dip was a pleasantly sour foil.  We also had an order of Thai-inspired Blue Bay Mussels with crispy soba and aioli, which were *fab-u-lous.*  I eat a lot of mussels, but these were some of the most enjoyable I've ever had.  For entrees, husband and I split the Soba Noodle Scallops -- which arrived at the table with root spinach, cuttlefish, wild mushroom, and fresh wasabi -- and the Seared Tuna -- with a sesame crust, cucumber-red-onion salad, kimchee, ginger fried rice, and peanuts.  Both dishes were out of this world.  Husband I had trouble cutting ourselves off at half and switching plates, but were both rewarded tenfold for doing so.  The scallops had a perfect sear, the soba was fat and chewy, the ponzu wasabi broth was soul-warming.  And the tuna was seared expertly, still gorgeously garnet and cool in the middle, complemented by a crunchy, nutty sesame crust and that flavorful rice.  I don't think either of us wanted that meal to end.  And all things considered, husband and I thought the bill at the end of the night was ridiculously reasonable.  Soba FTW.  Pittsburgh, I have a crush on you.  Your perfectly-priced fine-dining scene makes me want to pull up stakes and move in with you.",

I was able to get reservations for 7 at the last minute for Saturday night. We had a long table next to the waterfall on the first floor. It was a high top so it wasn't the most comfortable but for a last minute reservation it worked.  We started with the calamari which was delicious and then dived right into entrees. I had what I always get- the seared tuna. It's crusted with sesame seeds and comes with rice, BBQ sauce, Kim chee, and pickled vegetable. It's so delicious I never get anything else. I had bits of my moms duck which was also delicious and the boyfriends sea bass was amaze!   We did not stay for dessert at this visit but in the past I have enjoyed the ice cream with cashew dessert. Soba is really so good. And it looks to beautiful.",

    "text": "I eat at Soba with my parents almost every time they come to town. I'm just out of grad school and not exactly in a high paying field, so I can't afford to come here on my own. I've had a great experience every time except for the last one, when I came here with my boyfriend.   I've had the Thakkali curry, the chicken ramen, and the filet and they've all been wonderful. My boyfriend is horrified that I enjoyed the Thakkali curry so much because it's a vegetarian dish and he loves meat, but it really is tasty, especially the roti. I've had a bunch of the appetizers too, and my favorite is the Thai lettuce wraps.   The last time I ate at Soba, I had a less than good experience. Maybe I went into the dinner in a lesser mood than usual because I wasn't excited to see my parents (they weren't in town) and it was raining, but I just had a generally bad experience. I ordered the basil noodles and they were horrible. I've written in many of my other reviews that I do not like sweet noodles, and these tasted like candy. They were gross. And sloppy. And saucy. So I had about 2 bites and went home hungry.   I don't know if Soba directly employs its valet parking attendants or whether they contract out, but I also have a bone to pick with them. My boyfriend arrived separately in his fancy Audi and they parked his car right out front. I showed up in my Hyundai and they parked it over the river and through the woods. I joked to my boyfriend that they parked mine in another zip code because it's \"shabby\" and not fancy like his, and the parking attendant entered the conversation and told me yeah, that's True. They park the \"lesser\" cars in another lot because they're afraid of damaging the nicer cars. I get it. My car isn't a luxury car, so they are less afraid of having to pay to fix it if it gets dinged up, but is he really telling me that? I couldn't believe it.",

    "text": "This is a copy of my review for the event that this fine establishment hosted. I was not aware that the review would not show up on their restaurant page. I am kinda new at this! But yeah... Here it is..            Overall experience with the drinks was really good. The tai mule gave me a little tickle in the back of my tongue, with a taste of lemon and mint. The sangria was served with a orange(of course) and was blended perfectly with fruity and wine. The desert drink was different for me as I don't usually drink something with such a kick. So with that said, I am not sure if it was brandy or whiskey. Overall the drinks were fab.     The seared bar tuna was served with peanut and Korean bbq sauce. It was very tasteful and not dry at all. My head needed a minute to wrap itself around how good it was.     The double salmon roll was very good. The salmon was definitely fresh and put together very nicely. The other roll was  cucumber and avocado. I enjoyed this one because you were able to taste everything, including the seaweed wrap, which has been a while for me, so I know it was fresh.     The Korean fried chicken on a boa bun(rice flour), with a tomato, cilantro, and sweet pickle was delish! I really with I could have had another one!.. And will!     The rock shrimp was very good as well, with a nice spice to it. It wasn't dry and was very flavorful. This was also served very cute in a paper cone.     The sea bass kabob was cooked with perfection! The meat was juicy and flavorful with a sweet tasting glaze, and was not overwhelming with a seafood taste.     The shishito pepper were mild and either grilled or chard. Not sure if it had a taste of cayenne, but over all they were good. The edamame was good as well.     Being that this was an special event, I can not really being critical of the actual service we received, I will have to do that when I come back for a regular visit, but it was very good.  The ambiance was very nice and romantic, casual, and comfortable. That's all I can say!",

    "text": "This was one of the best dinners I've ever had. A total surprise as frankly, I didn't think of Pittsburgh as a culinary Mecca. But two for two. Soba's ambiance is ecclectic and Asian avant-guard.   Nestled in a newly gentrified part of Pittsburgh and close to everything.  Entering the restaurant, we were ushered promptly through the modern multi-storied restaurant to a quiet part of the restaurant, where our very service-oriented wait staff was eager to make our night a memorable one.  We started with the spicy tuna maki which was a tasty melange of tuna, corn nuts, avocado and peppers.   My BF had a Thai Corn Chowder soup which was more like a succulent potage.  We then shared the chopped salad, an iceberg-based salad with coconut tempura crisps, cashews, mango, cucumber, daikon, papaya, avocado, and all drizzled with a spicy miso dressing.   This last concoction was heavenly.  For a piece de resistance, my BF ordered the Alaskan Halibut, delicately cooked in a pomegranate-based sweet and sour sauce, and accompanied by the brussel sprouts and turnips with a butternut squash puree.  I had the Bronzini on lemon-grass broth, which the chef, upon request, fileted and removed bones and head, since it is  normally served whole.  This last concoction was absolutely amazing, with chopped buttercup squash, a slaw of apple and cashews, and drizzled with a lemongrass coconut sauce.  The dessert was their sorbet trio with the mango being the winner.    The entire evening was a wonderful concoction of flavors and Asian infusion.  A wonderful Argentine wine complimented the selections. Sorbet trio",

The tuna is my absolute favorite entree, hands down. The Korean barbecue sauce on the tuna has the perfect amount of acid and heat, and the sesame crust adds just the right amount of crunch for texture. It is served with ginger fried rice and kimchi, and both are always delicious.  To start, try the lobster maki and the Korean BBQ ribs. The octopus starter is also fantastic if you are feeling adventurous. I am obsessed with the chopped salad. I could eat this daily-no joke. The combination of daikon and mango with mint and cashews is absolutely perfect. I absolutely love love love this salad.  If you venture upstairs to Umi in your future eating adventures, rest assured that Umi's dessert menu features all Soba desserts. They always have a seasonal shortcake-my favorite is the plum. And the chocolate pretzel stack is pretty spectacular, despite the fact that I'm not really a chocolate person.   The only person in my party who wasn't blown away by their food the last time I was here ordered the vegetarian curry option. It was just okay due to its lack of complexity and flavor. But, unless you are a vegetarian, you really can't go wrong with any of the other entrees. Enjoy!",

It was impossible to get in anywhere and my group wasn't willing to stand outside in the brisk air just to get in and have to fight for seating or even a drink. Soba was the perfect choice! Love, love it here.  I have been here to eat before but most nights it's such a busy place that we head elsewhere. Since all of Pittsburgh was on Butler St we got in and sat right down in the lounge next to the glass fireplace! I would love to do a photoshoot in this sexy space. There is always a romantic mood at Soba. Martini glasses clinking in a group cheers, a spectacular setting for a lovely evening and exciting conversation, discussing all the interesting art we just saw.  You have to try the Cucumber Martini, it is \"muah\" marvelous! I think my drinks all summer will be Cucumber themed because it is so light and refreshing!   I have this thing for Pad Thai, and I am searching the city for the best. So that is what I ordered last time I dined here. It was a pretty decent Pad Thai but I am still looking for one like I had years ago at Papermoon in Erie. It was the best I ever had in my life, no competitors yet. The appetizers I have tried are very good. This is an upscale dining establishment so expect that the food will be as well. They have a small lot that is always packed so you may have to drive around on the small side streets to find parking. I think this is one of the best spots in the city for a date night!",

    "text": "Dining solo so my review is somewhat biased because of a slight uneasy feeling doing so at this establishment.  Don't get me wrong.  I dine alone and have done so quite often throughout the many years.  My point is that I shouldn't feel uncomfortable while doing so and some establishments seem to go out of their way on this point.  I chose this restaurant as a recommendation by my hair stylist as a treat to myself after getting a great new coif.  I walked the several blocks from the salon to the restaurant because it was a nice evening weather-wise and I hadn't really explored Shadyside before so it was fun taking in the architecture of homes, shopping, and seeing other restaurants in the neighborhood I want to try.  Upon entering, I stood for a few moments more than necessary to be greeted.  I was asked if maybe I wanted to sit in the lounge area; I looked and opted for a table, instead.  I then waited a few more moments more than necessary when he returned before he made eye contact after searching for an open table.  All I'm saying is that I definitely felt second-rate at the host(ess) station, whether that was because I was alone, alone as a woman, because I didn't have a reservation, or maybe my new coif wasn't as great as I thought (ha!).  I don't know and didn't really care for the feeling.  I did manage to stay; however, to be escorted to the top floor patio that is open but covered.  It was an exquisite place to dine.  My server was pleasant but definitely reserved.  I ordered a glass of Riesling ($10), a fair price amongst restaurants.  I also ordered Thai corn chowder and pork lettuce wraps, each coming to the table separately.  The corn chowder was flavorful but the texture wasn't what I expected.  It was more of a thick puree than chunks of corn.  Though good, I'd order something else next time simply because of the texture.  The pork lettuce wraps were excellent and plentiful to make a dinner portion for one.  All totaled, the bill was $30 for the glass of wine, soup, and lettuce wraps, a fair price in such a beautiful setting.  All in all, I would come here again but definitely with my husband.  It's a great date venue but a little more hoity-toity and prissy dining solo (aka \"pretentious\") than I particularly cared for.  Thus, 4 stars vs 5 stars for the review.",

After the initial \"we thank you for your patience \"walk around we did not see our server or host until we flagged someone down to get our check.  The restaurant did not offer any of us complimentary drinks or even ask how we were doing.  We left after sitting in the dark for 40 minutes and got tacos somewhere else.  The appetizers we had were great, but not worth sitting in the dark.",

I came to the lounge area on Thursday night with a friend around 7:30 PM.  We got the two last seats together, other than two at the bar, which is pretty impressive for a Thursday night.  Foremost, of the Big Burrito group, Soba might have the best atmosphere.  The lounge was similar to the upscale ones in New York, Chicago, D.C., etc., and I love that.  The drinks were really reasonable ranging from about $9-$12, although I mostly drink in the aforementioned cities so maybe slightly higher than the Pittsburgh average.  I ordered two Cucumber Collins ($11) drinks, which contained effen cucumber vodka, nigori, lime, and agave nectar.  This drink was light and refreshing and definitely not weak.  The wait staff was super laid back and disorganized, which is typical for this chain, but I don't mind it in this atmosphere.  All in all, I would definitely come back here for a drink.  Dinner is very far out of my budget here, but I am sure it would be good too.",

    "text": "Soba is a safe option when you want to have a fancy dinner and you're willing to go pricey, but not excessively pricey. I live in the neighborhood, and I come here with my boyfriend when we want to treat ourselves to a nice dinner but also don't want to travel far or take an Uber to do it. The cocktails are solid and the ambience is elegant - great whether you're coming here for food or just drinks. There are some dishes my boyfriend and I get every time we come: the pork buns and the rock shrimp tempura. Their sushi is also great. We've also had the bi bim bamp and the pad thai before; they're okay, but not outstanding. For entrees, I'd recommend sticking to the clay pot duck or the fried rice. The reason I give this place 3 stars is because of its service. I find it to be incredibly inconsistent. Sometimes it's great, but other times I've found the waiters to be lazy or forgetful. Given the price of this place, I expect to always have amazing service, but this hasn't been the case. I'll keep coming, though, because the food is good and is conveniently placed near where I live.",

    "text": "It's been 3 days since Yelps Swingin to Summer event and I had to get my Soba fix in. Pulling up to the restaurant you will see they have a valet service (tip based) which is awesome since parking in Shadyside can get tricky. I have seen a lot of pictures of the bar and lounge area from other reviews but I was really blown away by the interior design of the dining room. It was very modern and upscale! I also really loved the sliding doors it really opened up the area and let in a nice breeze.   I knew going into this dinner the filet satay was a must and so were the pork belly buns. My mom wanted to try the spicy chicken lettuce wraps so we ordered that as well. With the filet satay you get 3 skewers that come with 4 pieces of filet that basically melt in your mouth! The pork belly buns were also heavenly. There was a nice mix of flavors happening here, sweet and tangy! Last but not least the spicy chicken lettuce wraps delivered as well. My mom did say they were the best chicken lettuce wraps she has ever had and she is a big chicken lettuce wrap eater. They were not spicy at all which is what she was originally worried about. The halved peanuts, green peppers and caramelized onions really added extra flavor and crunch. The portions were very generous for these all being shareable. Next time I would like to try the Korean bbq ribs for sure!   Soba you are definitely on my favorite restaurant list and I recommend everyone to try it for themselves.",

First, the positives: +really solid food- I wouldn't say anything is \"amazing\" or \"inspired\"- but it is high quality and delicious.  + great cocktails  +fantastic ambiance no matter where you are.  Cons: - I wouldn't call this a con, but this is in a place that I'm just \"dying to go to\"- i've never walked away unhappy but I've never thought man I really want to go to soba tonight. Likewise I wouldn't put it on a list of must do restaurants in Pittsburgh - it's over priced - can get a wee bit crowded and as noted in other reviews, parking is a bit tough.  Over all if you live in Pittsburgh, or you visit a lot, this place is definitely worth a try for the variety. However if you're only visiting, I would say find something more unique.",

    "text": "Fan.tastic.  I came here earlier this year for a Yelp Elite event, and have been waiting for a good opportunity to return ever since.  (Read: I wanted to come back with someone that would be into this type of decor and food as much as I am!)  The opportunity presented itself when one of my best friends and fellow foodie came to town to visit.  We split several small plates, a salad, and an entree.  We were too stuffed for dessert, but I'm sure that would have been spot on as well.  My favorite small plate dish is the Chilean sea bass satays with a miso glaze.  It melts like butter in your mouth.  We had the Burmese tea leaf salad, which struck an excellent balance between a crunchy texture and bright flavors.  It was an excellent palate cleanser before  the main entree, Korean fried chicken.  This chicken is so flavorful and crunchy sitting atop its bed of spicy puree and roasted veggies.  The vinegary dipping sauce took it to the next level.  Our service was a bit slow (or perhaps the kitchen was behind?), for which the waiter profusely apologized.  However, in this type of setting, we were completely fine to have a longer than average wait time because we were enjoying our conversation and the atmosphere, so it set a nice pace for the evening.  (Anyone used to dining abroad would probably think absolutely nothing of it.)  This place is truly unique and I appreciate the way that it's fairly upscale with services like (free) valet parking and a coat check, but is still accessible from the standpoint of being not \"Just for special occasions because that's the only way you can afford it\" type of restaurant.  Soba is definitely a real favorite of mine and I look forward to a return trip.",

We sat at the bar, but the lounge has a lot of bench/couch type seating and small tables. It's not a huge space, but there's definitely enough room. We were there on a Friday around 6:30 and it wasn't too crowded.   For our dinner reservations, we were seated upstairs and thought the decor was really nice. It was a little dark, but that was okay. We could read the menu just fine and it made things feel cozy. I also liked that it wasn't too loud.  Dinner was amazing. We split 3 appetizers and an entree. This was some of the best calamari I've ever had and we loved the Korean fried chicken bao buns. The chicken was flavorful and really crispy. I'd really want to get those again or try the pork belly ones. We had tried the filet satays at a Yelp event, so decided to go with the sea bass satay and it was awesome. Really juicy and flavorful. The glaze was good too, but not too sweet. We got the miso black cod as an entree. I loved that this was just a little bit spicy and the cod went so well with the barbeque pork. The kitchen even split the entree in half for us, which made things so much easier. It was so nice of the waitress to offer.  I think this was one of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh. I really want to make it back. It was cozy and would work well for a romantic, casual meal out, or the lounge is great for a fun happy hour with friends.",

    "text": "We came here for my friend's birthday dinner last weekend after the Pirates game. My friend and her husband have been here on many occasions and really enjoy it; it was me and my husband's first experience at Soba. We had reservations for 6pm, but ended up arriving early, since after the Pirate game we just headed straight over. The hostess said that she could seat us right away, even though we were early. Although, this shouldn't have been a big deal since we were the only guests. My friend had originally booked a booth inside, but during the day we all agreed it wasn't too hot to sit outside. We were taken upstairs to their patio, which was very cozy and comfortable, with a nice view.  To be honest, I checked out the menu in advance and was a little hesitant, since there were things that I had never eaten and some I had never heard of! However, I'm always willing to give anything a try at least once. To drink, my husband had an iced tea. I got an Asian Plum Sangria: \"plum wine, merlot, peach, orange, pineapple\". It was tasty and refreshing, a little sweet but not bad. I was a little disappointed, hoping that it had actual pieces of fruit it in, which it did not.  Our friends suggested the Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps as an appetizer, they got an order and so did we. They were delicious! And, even sharing with the H, I was quite full from them. Since we ate a little at the game, we both decided not to get an entree. My husband got the Double Tuna Roll as his main course, which he said was very good. I went with the Crispy Calamari, which was described as having \"chilies, toasted garlic, mint, uni emulsion\". I asked the waitress about the sauce, which she described as not like mayonnaise, but the same consistency. And although a sea urchin, said it did not have a fishy taste. I was a little skeptical, so she said she would have the emulsion put on the side, since it normally comes drizzled on top. As I expected it would be, given how things were going so far, the calamari was delicious. It was fried, but very lightly breaded, not heavy at all. The sauce was, in fact, fishy, but I didn't mind it at all...it was also good. Besides the pieces my husband stole from me, I ate every last bite. Our friends both got dinners, my best friend had the duck. I had a small piece of it and thought it was quite good.  Our waitress was very friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. My only reason for not giving Soba 5 stars is the prices. While the appetizers and salad prices seem reasonable, the dinners appear a little on the expensive side for how much you get. I was perfectly full with sharing the appetizer and the calamari. I would like to try a dinner next visit, but feel that I would have to still get an appetizer to compensate.   Overall, the atmosphere was nice and relaxing. I liked how there are small little sections, so the place feels very private. Several groups came to sit outside while we were there, but it still felt intimate and not loud or intrusive. Would most definitely return.",

They must have replaced the lounge and the drink menu... because now it's memorable!  We were sitting there enjoying the open air windows looking onto the street, as the slight summer breeze rolled in, trying to figure out if this was an unused space or a new building they bought. Either way, the expansion is incredible!   I truly enjoyed sitting in the lounge sipping on some pretty phenomenal cocktails. I think sometimes I just assume Meat and Potatoes and Acacia are going to be the joints were I'm going to enjoy a stellar cocktail and that's it. But how narrow minded of me? I should be equal opportunity cocktail, right?!   I loved the Docksider (silver rum, aperol, agave nectar, grapefruit bitters, lemon, basil). I'm super into any cocktail with grapefruit, because that equals refreshing to me, and less sweet. But what blew me away was the Rebellion (beet infused wigle whiskey, luxardo maraschino). I love beets, so if you don't, this may not be the drink for you... BUT I thought it had a light beet taste with just the right amount of whiskey. And those maraschino cherries. Geez. I could eat gallons of them!  We also sampled some grub from the menu. The spicy noodles were very good, with just the right amount of spice to make my noose run (a sign of good spice). I could have used a touch more veggies, as the mushrooms were very good, but I find noodle dishes never have enough veggies in them. I thought the pork rolls were okay as well as the calamari, but really dug the yellowtail sashimi. Fresh and delicious. Like it should be!   I want to try every single drink. So let's begin...",

The word fusion to me  means that it is prepared in a combination of styles. However hear it seems to mean Asian food prepared by non Asians. The  California roll which does use a good amount of real crab meat doesn't meet the quality of an average sushi place. I  also tried the fried  Vietnamese spring rolls  which were soggy and bland. Some of the cocktails were good but the pours were light. Sorry but I can't recommend this place.",

Will have to go back and hopefully update my review.",

    "text": "I came to Soba with some friends for a late dinner on a Saturday evening. This is more of an upscale joint, but you definitely don't have to \"dress up.\" The ambiance was romantic and very dim lit. The place seemed pretty massive as there were several large rooms to dine as well as a lounge/bar area.   The menu had pretty basic Asian options. Nothing really stood out as unique in any way. I ordered the Pad Thai and my girlfriend got the Lettuce Wraps. The Pad Thai had a lot of flavor but lacked spice. I also think you should get the option to select chicken, shrimp, or tofu rather than mixing all three. I'm not a big fan of tofu and would have much rather had more chicken or shrimp. It was very tofu heavy. The portions of food were very generous. The lettuce for the wraps was more like a salad and didn't really allow you to create individual wraps with the leaves. However, the fried rice and pork filling for the lettuce wraps was fantastic! It had the perfect amount of spice and the rice was fried perfectly to add a little bit of crunchy texture. I could have eaten an entire bowl of that stuff. All in all it was a bit overpriced for simple Asian cuisine, but that's what you can expect in Shady Side. It wasn't bad by any means, but they didn't give me much of a reason to return.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like Soba more than I did! I have heard a lot of things about this restaurant but never had the chance to try it until I had some visitors from out of a town and another friend made reservations here for dinner.   There was a group of 6 of us who went out to dinner, our reservations were around 9:30 on a Saturday night. This is my friend's favorite restaurant who made the reservations- so I was looking forward to trying some new cuisine! When we arrived to the restaurant, the hostess informed us that our table wasn't ready yet so we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before we were seated. This was fine since we were able to grab some drinks at the bar while we waited. The inside of Soba is very dark and \"swanky\"... I did feel a little underdressed while being inside. It seems like a place that people were coming to celebrate special occasions... but there was also a small mix of people (including myself) who were dressed more casual.   After we were seated, we were all set on drinks. Everyone had ordered different drinks ranging from beers to martinis. I stuck with vodka and water for my not so fancy cocktail. For a starter, we ordered the rock shrimp tempura small plate. This shrimp was pretty good and was generous in size- there was more than enough for all of us to enjoy! For my meal, I ordered the spicy pork lettuce wraps off the small plate menu. This was very different from anything that I have ever had! The pork/rice mixture was delicious and had the right amount of spice. Again, this was a very generous serving for being considered a \"small plate\". Chris ordered the pad thai, which came with chicken, shrimp, and tofu. It seemed a little heavy on the tofu- which I'm sure next time he could ask for more chicken/shrimp. The pad thai was just OK- doesn't compare to others I have had in Pgh. Soba was a nice experience, but I think I'll try out some new places before returning.",

The Korean kim chi pancakes are delicious, filling, and a good option for sharing.  I've only sat in the lounge area, which somehow manages to be both sleek and comfy.

I had a delicious tequila cocktail called El Jefe, that I would order again in a second and my fiance had a Flying Dog beer. He ordered two appetizers for his dinner (shrimp spring rolls and a pork stir fry type thing) and I had the crispy tofu and chopped salad. Everything was very tasty. My only gripe was I felt like it was pretty expensive for what we got... We spent $75 all told, and we didn't even hit the \"entree\" side of the page or have multiple drinks a piece. Still, I would definitely be back. This is definitely the kind of place I would go for a special occasion or the next time my folks are in town.",

The clientele was mixed on Friday night - a couple with a child, two couples double-dating, people just getting drinks, etc.  Onto the food.  The Pacific Rim drink was fruity and not too strong, and also reasonably priced.  The crispy tofu appetizer is awesome.  If I lived closer, I would want it all the time.  The high crispiness level means it was probably deep fried, but it's so yummy I didn't even care. Spicy cucumber raita (amuse bouche) with flatbread was also delicious.  I kind of want a jar of it at home to put on sandwiches or something. As far as entrees, boyfriend had the beef brisket which he said was excellent and very tender.  I had the citrus tofu curry, which was just ok.  If I were a chef, I would have balanced out the very sweet citrus sauce with a little soy sauce or something savory.  The portions were more than big enough. And for dessert, we had the Vietnamese coffee creme brulee, which was beyond delicious.  I generally enjoyed the meal, but would appreciate maybe one more vegetarian entree to give diners a choice.  Also, a head's up: the adjoining parking lot is small, so if you have a reservation or are meeting people, make sure you allow time to find alternative parking if the lot is full.",

Because my experiences during recent visits have been positive, I am hoping that the 4 stars will stick this time.  One of Soba's consistent strengths is its ambiance. It offers a swank, contemporary atmosphere (and, unsurprisingly, with an Asian feel). The lighting is soft and pleasing -- great for romantic dinners, but still appropriate for business meals as well.   The menu also reflects a contemporary but Asian influenced theme. The dishes are a little less innovative than Tamari's, but they are generally well thought-out and well prepared. I especially recommend the beef short ribs (strong and complex flavors) and the fillet mignon (super tender and juicy). The kitchen sometimes seem to have temperature control problems. I have had disappointing seared tunas (over done) and on a recent visit, my \"medium rare\" fillet would probably be considered \"very rare\" by most restaurants in Pittsburgh.  The dessert is overpriced, but I have a special soft spot for the perennial chocolate maki.",

    "text": "I was recommended this restaurant by a friend a year ago and I loved it when I first went. It is dimly lit and has a very romantic ambiance. The seared tuna, made medium-rare, was warm and crunchy on the outside due to the sesame encrusted skin but still retained a nice, raw non-fishy tuna taste on the inside. The drinks are also fairly priced. Especially a year ago, if I remember correctly, it was around ~$65 for Moet Champagne which was very cheap so we ended up getting two which I guess helped the night go by easier. The lounge got busier and more vibrant as our Friday night went on at Soba Lounge. If I reviewed it last year, I would've given this restaurant five stars.  Impressed with my experience the first time, I went back again last Wednesday night. I still made a reservation on opentable but it was completely unnecessary since the restaurant was pretty empty. If that's the case I recommend you asking to be seated by the waterfall on the first floor. A bottle of Moet went up to $87 so I decided not to get it this time and moved straight to the food.  I began the meal this time with calamari, followed by the tuna again with the bronzini (sea bass) for myself and ended the meal with a light honeycrisp apple pudding cake dessert. I'm not quite sure what the sauce was for the calamari but it didn't go quite well with the oversized fried squid. They were not bite-sized and I've never had to cut calamari before. Even though the restaurant wasn't very busy, I was surprised the chef was still able to undercook the ginger rice accommodating the Tuna dish to an inedible level. The waiter apologized and don't get me wrong, there was great service, but I still ended up paying full fare for half a meal. For that I had to drop the restaurant down one star.  There's a parking lot available right next to the restaurant but spaces are limited. Street parking around the neighborhood shouldn't be too hard to find too.",

But lately, I notice a slight drop in quality in the food (subtle changes like the chips that accompany the tartare).  And I do not at all like that there are ever fewer small plates to choose from, rather being forced to get a plate to \"share\" when we dont' want to share.   The service has dropped a bit too.  The servers used to be so professional that it felt like NY.  Still better than most places but I am disappointed that Soba has not been able to maintain the level of quality that brought me there in the first place.  It may just be that now that there are so many other good new restaurants, there are just not enough quality servers to staff them all. The menu has become too predictable and boring.  Kind of flat.  Like the kitchen is no longer inspired.  It feels like the energy has gone into building the addition rather than the food and service. I am writing not to complain but rather to encourage everyone to perk up and go back to the lovely choices, presentations and service that brought you to be voted one of the city's best.  As you know, if you don't constantly maintain your standards in this business, you'll sink into oblivion.  And i'd hate to see that happen!",

The best part of our experience was the food.  We started off with the Crispy Tofu small plate.  This was far from small and was a lovely pile of fried tofu in a pad thai-like sauce which featured some good green onion and black pepper.  We then moved on to our entrees.  I had a very generous portion of short rib.  It was a very slow cooked, tender (but not too fatty) short rib atop a bed of roasted fingerling potatoes, sweet potatoes and carrots all topped by a lovely korean-like barbecue sauce and peanuts.  WOW!  My partner had a very tasty Hedgehog Mushroom, Rice Cake Noodle, Basil, Apple combination.  She is vegetarian and noted that Soba had some of the best and most original vegetarian options she has seen in Pittsburgh.  Lastly, the lower points of the meal.  The wine list, while somewhat extensive, was rather ho-hum and a bit overpriced on the low end (more moderate on the high-end).  Wines by the glass were a mediocre pour.  The service also left some to be desired.  When it became somewhat obvious we weren't going to throw down more than $100, our server became elusive and rather short with us when he did show his face.  In addition to his lukewarm, standoffish nature he did not offer any recommendations and his familiarity with the wine list seemed to be marginal at best.    Anyhow, he didn't ruin the meal and I can't wait to go back and have good service so I can rate this place the 5 stars it deserves!",

Soba is probably my fave BB restaurant (I haven't been to Umi yet). I love creative foods and drinks and Soba delivers here. It's about 17-item small plates list seems extensive, because you would want to try every one of them. We shares six small plates for dinner - grilled octopus, Vietnamese shrimp and squid, yellowtail sashimi, lobster maki, Korean bbq ribs and calamari. The Viet shrimps were quite overcooked - kind of like when you try cooking the chilled cooked shrimps. It's sauce and the accompaniments were amazing though. The ribs were a big hit, crispy, tender and not fatty. I wish the sashimi was a little bigger in portion and the calamari about half the amount they offer. The portions, except for the sashimi were \"Pittsburgh portions\". I almost had to be rolled back home; I was that full, and happy. If I am to spend $100+ on dinner, then I want to be this happy that I would want to write a yelp review the very next morning.",

I wish they could have a separated quieter area.  We ordered some desserts and those are incredible. Very delicious, big portion ( can easily be shared by two people) and inexpensive ($6-8).  One of the two desserts that we ordered was the chocolate maki. It has chocolate maki roll pieces (hard chocolate wrap and chocolate mousse filling), chocolate sauce as the soy sauce and pistachio sauce as wasabi. Very nice presentation and great taste, although it's a little big heavy. You might want to share it with another person.  Another one was the banana split. It has two banana halves covered by crispy sugar coating, three different kinds of ice cream and a banana cake. Very tasty, and each piece has a different contradictory flavor. Highly recommend it.",

Even though I came here on a Monday night I can imagine that this place gets packed so if I were you I would make a reservation, I guess I just always make a reservation if I can get one at a time that works for me as I did on a Monday even though I don't think that it was warranted.   Right from the get go I was pleased with the ambiance of this place. We showed up early and went to have a drink at the bar were we received very friendly unrushed service from the bar tender. I had a few questions about what was on tap and they were very knowledgeable which I can appreciate.   After we finished our drinks we headed over to check in for dinner and we were seated immediately. Soon afterward we were greeted by a really cool and professional waiter. I thought that it was great that he had a really good understanding of the menu at Soba and had no problem discussing the different items to help us make a decision.   We started with the crispy tofu, spicy tuna Maki, and grilled baby octopus. All were tasty bites. The crispy tofu was by all means excellent, the only thing was that the sauce that the tofu bits are tossed in takes away from any sort of characteristic that reflects crispiness. I might ask next time to have the sauce on the side. The Octopus was like it was fished out of the sea the day we ate it. It was a nice light dish that was tender the way an octopus should be. Thanks for that by the way, I hate choking on rubbery seafood. The Spicy tuna maki was also beautiful and tasty and would almost recommend this appetizer over the other two that we had if you had to only choose one. Over all 3 appetizers was way too much for us.  I don't order steak out that much but I said what the heck I'm going to see what this place has got. I ordered Medium-Rare like an aristocrat would. And once again they didn't let me down. Perfecto and the chili mashed potatoes, well I wish that I could drink them or get them via I.V. they were so good but I was so stuffed. Darn it! I tried some of the Seared Rare Tuna, oooooo! that was soo good as well, next time I may get that. All in all, heck of a great meal and I will be back sooner rather than later as there is a large menu to choose from.   I was also very happy by the friendliness as well as the professionalism of the valet service. The guy had my car out super fast and had my car configured just the way I had left it with the wheels turned for the getaway.   Go check it out for yourself I can't imagine that you will not get anything less than the best of service and quality here.",

Are they really going crazy for corn chowder in Chang Mai?  You never find, say, Mexican-Moroccan or  Ethiopian-Brazilian fusion places.  That would be really inventive.  Instead, with Soba, you have another pan Asian-American Fusion joint, although I don't think I've been to a better one.  The mussels are incredible, a meal in themselves, and a bargain at $9.    I had the chopped salad, with fresh mango, avocado, mint, and just a hint of spice.  The best meal I've had here was the mussels, followed by the tuna.  The crabcakes are also good, made with lump crabmeat.    If you feel like something vaguely Asian, but not too Asian (ex: kimchee pancakes), you won't find a better option.  But if you want something truly original, you have to go elsewhere.",

Sandwiched in the folded Chinese steamed bun were fresh cilantro, two flavorful, tender slices of pork belly, and a slathering of  hoisin BBQ sauce that was both tangy and savory.  If you consider these the Asian version of a White Castle slider, then go ahead and put me down for a Crave Case.  For my entree I had the Chili-Miso Black Cod.  Our waitress mentioned this was a fairly new addition to the menu, and, from what my stomach tells me, it's going to be on that menu for quite some time.  The black cod was delicate and delicious.  The rice cake noodles were like an Asian-style gnocchi, and their slight firmness provided a nice textural change to the black cod.  The sauce itself was flavorful, only slightly spicy, and included little shreds of pork and pine nuts to add to the flavor profile.  Dinner ended well with the Frozen Cashew Terrine.  The layers of chocolate ganache and candied cashews balanced well with the mango and raspberry coulis.    The interior itself was dimly lit and had a modern Asian vibe.  The wait staff was also very friendly and made some great recommendations.  If I'm ever back in PIT, Soba immediately jumps to number one on my dinner list.",

A cup given with no ice and a bottle of soda?  Why weren't their any ice in the glass? Who drinks sodas at room temperature. This restaurant maybe was trying to be too fancy and forgot the basics of ICE.  Maybe it is really just me who prefer cold sodas. Overall it is okay, but not justified by the price.",

They call it 'Asian fusion' = random combinations of ingredients, some 'Asian' others not so much. Just because you add soy sauce or rice noodles won't make it Asian. Two stars for the food.  Part II of two - the bar.  Best cocktails in the Burgh. Hands down. They are artisans. There is Plymouth gin. The Sobatini, a ginger-martini, is healthy enough to count as vitamin tonic. Clean, tangy, and refreshing.   Advice: skip the restaurant, have a few drinks at the bar, eat from the bar menu if you must eat. I usually end up having drinks at Soba and then dinner at Eleven, another of their restaurants.",

    "text": "There have only been two superb fusion restaurants that I have been to in the world. There have been quite a few that were average and some that down right stunk. The problem with most fusion places that they rely on the principal that the sum will equal more than the parts and therefore, the parts do not have to be that good to begin with. Unfortunately Soba falls in that category.  For example the corn fritters we had, if you tried the fritters on their own they were barely passable, greasy, falling apart and not much flavor - a virtual fritter failure, however you wrap that mess in the bibb lettuce, put on a basil leaf and dip it in the sauce chili-soy sauce and all of a sudden it becomes a tasty little snack. But I still have to ask would this dish not be better if ALL the components were excellent?   The Thai corn chowder tasted good, but had a funny mouth appeal, grainy and lumpy at the same time and didn't look appetizing brownish yellow. We eat with our eyes, nose, taste and tactile feel so while this tasted good it didn't do so well on the other requirements.  The mushroom and spinach dumplings were actually very blah, relying on the red pepper dipping sauce for their flavor. However the chopped salad was excellent, so all is not dismal at Soba.  I could go on but you get the idea. The place is expensive for what you get, they should pay more attention to the parts, master making them correctly before you try fusing it into another cuisine to cover up your mistakes. Overall most people are not as picky as I am, we tried, it was good with some problems, problems that should not have been there at their price point.  3.5 stars",

The pork dumplings and the the vinegar sauce... to die for!!!  They have a nice happy hour M-F as well.  Good cocktails.  I think many entrees are overpriced, but they are good.  But $24 for a chicken ramen dish... I still get it because it's excellent, but even restaurants in San Francisco and NYC don't charge this much for such a dish.  The Bronzini dish is always excellent and they try to add a few other tasty specials in from time to time... but in my opinion the menu doesn't change too often.  It's a good place to go when you want to get exactly what you want... meaning, whatever you had on the menu last time will probably still be on the menu.",

If I wanted mediocre food, I would go to fridays or olive garden-- was it comparable?  Yes, for quality of food.  The price, obviously, was much more.  This fake fusion place would have gone out of business, regardless of price, if it had to compete with the likes of Slanted Door or was located in a city with good food.  If this is representative of the best Pittburgh has to offer, then take the money you would have spent here and reinvest it in a trip to SF or NYC and eat well for a week. How sad is that?  Don't go here... you pay $30 for an entree, $10 for an appetizer, and $15 for a mediocre wine.  Not worth it...",

However, I felt particularly compelled to take 15 minutes to discuss Soba Lounge with the E-universe. Put simply, the food is amazing. I went with a group of friends and we all decided to splurge on a good meal. The end result was we still found ourselves talking about this meal the next morning.   I have never tasted anything quite like the wagyu beef buns and highly recommend them. The combination of wagyu beef and flavorful kimchi, surrounded by a soft, delicate bun rivaled the best cheeseburger I've had in my life. For entree I went for the tandoori grilled salmon and this also did not disappoint. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was well complimented by a tangy yogurt sauce.   The ambiance is an upscale, dimly lit presentation, perfect for a romantic date or a couples outing. The service was friendly and fairly timely.   I look forward to the next time I am back in Pittsburgh area and can return, as the quality of the food is well worth the higher price-tag, and the menu provides adequate diversity.",

And doubly impressed that it was listed as one of the magazine's top 25 restaurants in the city. With a build up like that, I was very excited to dine here.   We had an early evening reservation. The exterior is described as 3 story Victorian. Looked like a homely dump to me. Inside was a very different story. Sleek and modern, with a Zen like garden feel, we were excited as little kids to be lead to table on the 3rd floor near the bar area. I thought the atmosphere was tranquil and very romantic. I started with the thai corn chowder with crab meat. I was taken aback by the color, a sort of dreary gary/mustard. But it was very delicious, very spicy. My BBF had a salad that was very flavorful with chicken and fresh spring greens. We were also served an appetizer with cucumber and pita chips.   For dinner, we had the filet mignon and the seafood hot pot. The filet was extremely thick and served with a nice vegetable mixture and potatoes.  The flavor was amazing.  The seafood looked delicious, I sampled the shrimp and they were very well seasoned.   Dessert was also just as amazing. We shared the vanilla-roasted Asian pear served with a gingerbread biscuit, Asian pear sorbet and sabayon. We also shared a chai spiced creme caramel flan. It was so yummy with pumpkin seed brittle and vanilla chantilly.   All in all a very special evening. Everything was wonderfully presented and service was very good.  I have to agree with the readers of Pittsburgh mag.",

We sat in the upstairs area which is just as sexy as the rest of the restaurant. I enjoyed a glass of Tempranillo, my guests enjoyed a carafe of sake. I strongly believe their wine prices lean toward the higher end, but it's Shadyside and I wouldn't expect anything different. I'm a fan of mussels, although I have yet to have better mussels than those served at nearby Point Brugges. The mussels at Soba were on the smaller side, although there were plenty in the bowl. The broth was good, although it was difficult to soak it up with the yummy pita that they served on the side. My guests both enjoyed their meals. We finished the evening up with a creme brulee. It was quite delicious although there was a very small piece of hard plastic that we found. We brought this to the servers attention. We greatly appreciated the dessert being removed from the bill, including our drinks. Despite this fluke, I will be back and will continue to support this restaurant.",

My husband and I shared a sake, lobster maki, seared tuna w/ kimchi, and scallop udon. All yum. We were also surprised by the generous entree portions.   What made my experience at Soba so great was the dessert menu. As much as I love dessert and sweets, I typically do not like a lot of ingredients used for desserts (ie. nuts, chocolates, raisin, certain fruits, cinnamon, & other spices). But when I saw their dessert menu, I craved almost all of them. Although my husband and I usually share one dessert, we decided on two. We had the cream brulee and dark chocolate mousse maki. Both were ridiculously scrumptious.",

I loved it too, but after realizing there were so many other worthy restaurants to try in Pittsburgh, Soba fell by the wayside, to the point where I figured that maybe I was playing it up to be better than it actually was in my head.  I ended up going back to Soba for dinner this week since it's right around the corner from my new place. And it was actually just as good as I remembered! I was upset that there was nothing pork belly related on the menu (that was always my favorite here), but ended up getting yellowtail sashimi, scallops with a peach jam, and the chopped salad. The chopped salad here, which changes with the seasons, is possibly one of my favorite salads of all time. There's always like ten thousand ingredients in it and it's always super refreshing (this time there was nectarine, coconut, cucumber, avocado, mint...).  I wish the restaurant wasn't QUITE so dark (this seems to be the trend in all Big Burrito restaurants) and we were being stared down by a snobby older couple the entire time (we dined at 10pm, and were dressed to go out afterward...I don't know if it was my friend's tattoos or the fact that I was wearing a crop top that was so offensive, but they were NOT having it!), but otherwise it was an all-around awesome experience. Our waitress was super nice and down-to-earth and didn't make us feel like we were out of place at all. So, Soba, you have managed to maintain your 5-star rating from me, and I'm so very sorry I've been neglecting you!",

I have ordered the spicy tuna roll and double salmon roll. While the rolls do taste good, I don't think they were really worth the price. I would've enjoyed an order of another appetizer instead.  Soba has an eclectic variety of Asian inspired dishes, and I will be returning soon to try different items on its menu.  --  taste / 4 aesthetics / 5 vibe / 5 service / 4 price for quality / 3 OVERALL / 4.2",

    "text": "The weird thing about Soba is their appetizers are way better than their entrees. My husband and I split 2 appetizers and 2 entrees and I loved both appetizers, however both entrees were just ok.  The sea bass satays were amazing. If you love sea bass they're a must try. Also the double salmon roll was so good. The salmon was extremely fresh and melts in your mouth.  If I eat at Soba again I'm tempted to just order more appetizers/shared plates and skip the entrees.  Dessert was really good too. Ordered the chocolate peanut butter pretzel and it was delicious.  I highly recommend eating outside on their patio upstairs. Great setting and atmosphere.  If you wanna check out Soba I would recommend it however it's not one of my regular go to restaurants.",

I had a lobster taco which was very good. This was followed by a Korean sea bass entree.  It was delicious but it was served in an unadorned  white cereal bowl. The presentation could have been a little more interesting.  Two glasses of good chardonnay at $17 each. Dinner for one with tip was $91.  I live in Connecticut outside of NYC and am used to high prices but this was Manhattan pricing in Pittsburgh.  Otherwise, it was quite nice.",

First, I love and might be addicted to the rock shrimp tempura appetizer - so light and crunchy and delicious - you have to try!   High hopes for the Chilean sea bass  satays but I didn't care for it too much.  Maybe because I love Chilean sea bass so much - it's so buttery and tender without having to do anything to it - it felt like such a crime to sauce up such a beautiful tasting fish - I mean they could've swapped it with cod and it would've tasted the same.  They had a Korean fried chicken bahn mi (not on menu but should get if available) that was super tasty.    For dinner our table got the dolsot bi bim bap x2 (yum!), tandoori grilled salmon (yum!), and a Long Island duck (yum!).   Everyone gave it a thumbs up!    And since it was my bday we had to get dessert and wowza - soba can DO dessert!  We got 2 and shared and the combo of both together we ate every little bit- please get the chocolate pretzel stack and the soba banana split.  So yum  Oh check out the lounge - there was a dj and it was a great vibe - they also have drink specials after 10 pm - I'm going to try the khaleesi next time",

    "text": "I am usually not a fan of Asian fusion restaurants. To me, most of the time this ends up being Asian dishes that are made worse rather than interesting but still delicious.  Soba defies this stereotype. They have some interesting dishes but almost everything I've tried is pretty solid.  My favorite is the Miso Black Cod. The ssam jang (miso type) flavor is pervasive throughout the dish and makes the savory component complex and interesting in every bite. A slightly different take on the Nobu version, including some complements that I think elevate the dish even more. The rice cake is soft but chewy, and the black cod, the star of the dish is tender, flaky, and (dare I say it) moist. The pine nuts add a little bit of crunchy buttery and somewhat sweet taste.  Another favorite among my friends is the Rock Shrimp tempura. This is a dish that is featured in many menus, but Soba executes it so well: lightly fried and paired with a slightly sweet, slightly spicy aioli. Yum.  Their cocktails are generally strong (minus perhaps the sangrias which are just sweet but yummy), their decor is elegant, and their service is generally spot on. There's a reason that this is (and will continue to be) one of my most visited places in Pittsburgh!",

The whole experience was amazing.  We started out with both types of sangria. The white was good until you tasted the red, which was delicious. We loved it.  Our appetizer was the filet satay. Wow! It was perfectly cooked & seasoned. The meat was so tender and melted in our mouths. We hated for it to end.  I had the Pad Thai and I normally love Pad Thai. Everyone raved about it, but unfortunately I don't think it lived up to the hype. I did not find it flavorful at all. I also felt they could have made it a lesser portion & charged less.  My husband had the Korean fried chicken & loved it. I thought it was moist & delicious with perfect breading. The only thing I didn't like on the plate was a tiny bit of potato that looked like a sweet potato, but tasted like a bland potato.  We finished the night off with the pretzel stack. A friend of ours loved it & I did not care for the taste at all.  The decor and ambiance in the dinning room was great. The lounge was beautiful and looked like a fun place to have cocktails with friends. We'll definitely be back.",

My girlfriend took me here the other day for my birthday dinner and we were not disappointed with our experience. The decor here was hip and relaxing, sort of a zen/feng shui vibe. Not sure if it met actual taoist standards, but it definitely appeals to the average Westerner (could that sentence be more pretentious?). Service was friendly and well informed, our waiter answered all of my questions.  Anywho, the food here was really great. We started with the steamed pork dumplings and the chilean sea bass satays. The dumplings were yummy but not inspired. The satays, LORDY, those were fantastic. No Joke, the chilean sea bass satays were the best seafood dish I've ever tasted. The fish was buttery and sweet, but complimented with lemon juice to balance it out with some acidic flavoring and DANG, it really was fantastic. Do yourself a flavor and order the chilean sea bass satay if you go to Soba. For my main course, I had the dolsot bi bim bap. The searing rice bowl was delicious, I had to eat around some of the spicier parts but it was still yummy. My girlfriend got the tuna steak, which was seared beautifully. Really generous portions for the entrees: we both brought stuff back home.  Soba is sweet, I do not have any criticisms from my experience with the food and staff here. While it was a great experience, I am not giving 5 stars because I beginning to realize that 5 stars means I regard the experience as \"perfect.\" I do not regard this experience as perfect because there was a first date sitting next to my girlfriend and I and it was not going well. He could really have let her talk more, but it seemed like she did not have anything interesting to say. It was very awkward. I was happy when they left. Food was great though. Woo!",

Me and my friend ordered \"Rock Shrimp Tempura, Corn Chowder Soup,\" for the Appetizers, and for the entree. \"Spicy Cantonese beef noodle\" aka \"Beef Chow Fun\" lol and \"Thai Curry Chicken\" The appetizers were great and the Rock Shrimp Tempura taste decent. As for my entree I was a little dissatisfied with my portion. My \"Spicy Cantonese Beef Noodle\" the portion size is great can serve for two. I have ate at numerous of restaurant that have \"Beef Chow Fun\" too. Each of them are good. This place there spicy Cantonese beef noodle disappointed me! It was really salty, the beef chunk are big but that is fine. Just the dish too salty and the noodle need to be boil a little longer. It was a little too hard. I wrote this because \"Beef Chow Fun\" is one of my favorite food that I had since my childhood to present! I know each restaurant have their own special way of making them for a regular person who have ate this dish can tell the different immediately.    This restaurant the price is little bit above average. That is fine, as long it taste good. Anyway a great place for date and romantic dinner for couple.",

The food (Thai Corn Chowder, Steam Squash dumplings, Bah Mi Bao Buns (the last two appetizers are on the \"to share\" section and that's what we did) the Tuna and lobster rolls for her and the Pad Thai for me) was all excellent in taste and presentation.    I'm just giving a 4 out of 5 to an amazing dinner because: 1) it could be more clear (specifically, written on the menu for example) that the Pad Thai automatically comes with Chicken, Shrimp and Tofu and 2) the portions for the main courses were too huge (I had enough pad thai for 2 more meals at least) for both of us (but especially on the pad this, which on its own, sans any appetizers is easily two meals) and that the chicken on mine was a little too blackened for my taste; and  3) the service was a little fast between courses.   Overall though, an excellent meal the two of us are still talking about!",

When you walk in you really feel important.  Your table feels intimate, your server is interested in you, and most importantly the food is amazing!          On my last birthday in June it probably was my best experience yet.  We had reservations for right when they opened because we were going to the Pirate game right after.  We were the first ones there.  It was hot out but we asked to sit outside because we had never done that here before.  I loved it outside but it was probably a little to hot for us.  We could have gone back inside but we decided to stay out and just drink some cold water.         One thing about nice restaurants are that if you're really hungry you need to get a appetizer.  Usually the main dish isn't big enough.  That's one thing I have learned and I made sure to get an appetizer here.  I got the Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps.  They came out with some lettuce but a ton of meat!  It was great!  It was by far the best lettuce wraps I've ever had.  We needed more lettuce to eat it all.  It was so juicy, great spices, and refreshing.         The wraps were really filling.  Started second guessing my tip there about ordering an appetizer but I'm still glad that I did.  For my main dish I ordered Tandoori seared Scottish salmon.  Every time I come to Soba the menu is nice and challenging for me.  It's not like going to a chain restaurant and you already know what to expect and what you are going to order.  At Soba I like to read through the menu and see what I might like.  Then you have to read what comes with the rest of the dinner.  I usually take a little risk.  I like Salmon but I'm not sure if I will like everything that goes with the dish.  This has happened before to me at Soba.  \"lentils, green beans, fennel-orange salad, coriander raita, orange oi\"?  Will all of that work well with my Salmon?  I ordered it not sure if I would like it but the small risk turned out to be a big reward! This was one of the best plates that I have ever had.  It was so good.  The Salmon was cooked perfectly and all the other sides on the dish worked together so well.         They never disappoint me here.  Each time I come here it just keeps getting better and better!  I always recommend this place to my friends when they are looking to take out their love one to a special dinner.   Soba will not disappoint you!",

    "text": "The hanger steak was to die for. The jalapenos on it brought a welcome amount of heat to balance the sweet on the dish. Absolutely delicious. Spicy tuna roll was just that. I wasn't a big fan of the spring rolls, but my dinner date loved them. Nice dark ambience. The service left a bit to be desired. Server was new, and it in no way ruined the fine dining experience, but little things were overlooked. Items that were clearly not being used (chopsticks, soy sauce pot) were left on the table through dessert. Our server knew the menu well and made recommendations per food category, which I'm sure he was trained to do. But a suggested 'favorite' for each of 6 sections on the menu was a bit long-winded and just too much. Overall a nice experience, but 5 star service and attention to detail would get it to the actual 5 star mark.",

    "text": "MMM my hubby and I went there for the first time tonight.  Its probably our new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.    After they took our coats, we were seated on the 2nd teir looking across to the waterfall wall... We were there a lil early for dinner (530ish) So we were theonly ones upstairs, it was really nice... and quiet.  Service was wonderful and relaxed.   First, ordered the corn chowder, and the lobster maki for starters. I'm VERY picky about sushi, hubby loves it, and he can rarely get me to eat it.  It was delcious!!  I'm actually craving more now that I'm thinking about it.    The corn chowder was also very tastey... but after 3 or 4 bites you're mouth needs some time to cool down!! Its got some kick, but a good kick :)  Ohh, I almost forgot the complimentary appetizer that the chef sent out... I wasn't really listening to her explain it, but it was some sort of delcious hummus on a truffle infused chip... AMAZING.  They should put iton the menu :)    For entrees, I got the pad thai and hubby got the filet.  Both were really good, the filet especially.  Probably one of the best steaks I've had.  Hubby gobbled down the whole thing...  but i had to box up most of my pad thai... I think the sushi and the corn chowder filled me up... ANDi wanted to save room for a dessert.  OMG.  We shared the frozen cashew terrine.  Orgasmic.    This will be our new regular place, i think :)",

    "text": "How have I not reviewed Soba yet?  Well, let me remedy this oversight directly.  WIth this review I have now completed a clean sweep of all big burrito restaurants and I believe have not give one less than four stars.  This is a testament to this talented restaurant group which recently gained national attention by being named a semi-finalist by James Beard foundation for restaurater of the year.  That's it Pittsburgh we are getting more and more attention with the national food scene.  So, I've been here a million times (well, not literally) and was here last on Wednesday for business prior to the Pitt game with Mike and G. W. (not our former president...he hates asian fusion).  The space is beautiful and I spend most of time at the bar where they serve the full menu.  Howeve, a couple tidbits on the dining room.  It's three levels with a bar on the first and third level I believe an also a deck for al fresca' dining.  The first level is beautiful earthy tones, white linens and really comfortable chairs with some bench seating on the sides and four tops scattered about.  The ceilings are very high and there is a staircase in the middle of the room.  The top floor has very nice wood floors and a small wood bar.  The lighting is intimate and flattering.  The bar itself is pretty large with bench seating on the sides and nice comfy leather chairs for lounging.  I believe the doors open up to the sidewalk in the summer.  The service is always adequate, but not necessarily friendly I'd say. I usually get this bald fellow who is nice enough, but probably wouldn't engage in conversation if I was by myself.  One small complaint is that they tend to keep the bar really dark, which I like if I'm trying to hide in the corners while I drink away my concerns, but if I'm on a date I'd prefer a little more light.  The menu seems to me to not change that frequently and I rarely hear them offer features not already on the menu.  I guess it's because I've been here so often, but I wish they had more options.  We started Wednesday with korean barbecue ribs, chicken spring rolls and calamari.  The barbecue ribs were probably the best thing I had there all night.  They were well seasoned, fall off the bone and a healthy portion for only $9.  The chicken spring rolls were forgettable and the calamari was just \"ok\".  It was served lightly breaded, but lacked any real flavor.  We all drank relatively reasonably priced wine for under $10 a glass.  G. W. and I ordered the seared rare tuna, which is a very healthy portion of fresh quick seared good quality tuna with a sesame seed coating.  It's served with house made kim chi (really spicy) and ginger fried rice.  It's a safe choice and probably the most popular entree on the menu.  Mike had the seafood hot pot, and I think he was the winner with best entree' choice.  It was a delicious curry broth served with rice on the side overflowing with mussels (fresh), scallops (cooked perfectly) shrimp and I thinkI may have even have tasted sausage.  We skipped dessert.  This is a good place for some drinks and even a nice meal, especially if you don't come here often.  Congrat's again big burrito group for the James Beard nom.",

The wonderful thing about living in a city like Boston is that there are few chain restaurants, but infinite amounts of local-owned restaurants with hip atmosphere and delicious food made with fresh ingredients and a whole lotta passion.  I understand you're hard up, but this place made your list of top 25 restaurants in the city?  Seriously?  The decor looked much like many homes in the suburbs outside your city-a little bit o' this and a little bit o' that, but that is beside the point.  Swarmy waiters you have to flag down for service (and by the way, the locals were having to do it too) is not charming or cool.  It's unacceptable.  Especially when a restaurant has the audacity to charge what this place was for a crappy meal.  And I'm telling you, other than the Thai corn chowder, this food was barely edible.  What with all the Kings and Eat-n-Parks you may not know this, but trust me, a visitor from the land of delicious, this is just gross.  And to pay anywhere over $100 for gross (or even anywhere edging up to $100) is just a slap in the face.  It's time for Pittsburgh to get standards that are above ground.  A restaurant like just should be nowhere near your top 25.",

Popped in here only for a nightcap after our lousy Taco Bellesque dinner at the Shady Grove and it was the highlight of the evening.  I've been coming here off and on for years, and the espresso martini is my favorite choice, at only $8 per glass!  Comprehensive beverage menu featuring some excellent wines as well as the darling cans of Sofia champagne.  As a matter of fact, this is the only bar that I have seen offer these besides Coppola's restaurant in North Beach.  if you don't know what they are, it's the grown up girl's take on those Minute Maid drink boxes that your mama packed in your lunch, and definitely a girly drink, but a bit pricy at $11 per can.  Next time I return, I plan to dine here and I can see Soba Lounge being my \"Bar away from SF Bars.\"",

The food was definitely some of the best food I have ever had. The drinks were all very interesting as well. Very tasty! We ordered an array of small plates to sample various different things. Each one was better than the next. The spicy tuna maki roll was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The tempura green beans were so delicious too! We sampled everything from soup to salad and Korean BBQ ribs. Everything delicious! We even left room for dessert which was equally amazing. My friend had the sesame ice cream with salted caramel. It sounded strange to me at first but it was so delicious. I had the chocolate make which was so beautifully prepared and delectable although extremely rich with the dark chocolate. Definitely something to share because of the richness, I was only able to eat a few bites. My other friend got the pandan leaf panna cotta. After reading it on the menu, I didn't think it sounded like something I would like. Boy oh boy, was I wrong. It was amazing! I can't wait to return to Pittsburgh to visit Soba again!",

This place has been on my list for a while, and I was finally able to convince my husband make the trip for date night.   The only seating available without a reservation was at the bar, which is never a problem for us. We were two of the only three people there, and it was really quiet, so perfect!  We were greeted by the bartender who was very knowledgeable and friendly. He provided us with drink menus and gave us an ample amount of time to decide.   We started with the hamachi sashimi, which was a brilliant blend of pomegranate, pear, and avocado with amber jack tuna. A spicy little sauce was plated along with it, and the mix was really tasty. Beautiful presentation as well.   My main course was the Thaikkal curry, which was a fun, educational dish for me. First, the eggplant was fire-grilled, which blended so well with the curry sauce. It was plated with bean sprouts and slices of fresh mango, which I had never thought to pair with a curry. The roti was fried, which I didn't prefer.   My husband ordered the seafood hot pot. Quite a full portion of seafood with a side of rice, this vast array of shellfish went down quick. His comment was \"It's Big Burrito salty.\"  Really savory food and pleasant service in an atmosphere drowned in Massive Attack. That's Soba.",

At my suggestion, he ordered the Korean Fried Chicken (the Yelp sample was sooo good, I had to see what the entree was like). At the recommendation of our fabulous server Albert, I tried the Pad Thai.  I wouldn't usually order Pad Thai outside of the food truck in the Strip, but he assured me that it was above and beyond the regular Pad Thai...and he was RIGHT. This delicious monstrosity is sure to feed me for days. It includes tofu, shrimp, chicken and I swear 4 lbs of noodles.  It's definitely the best Pad Thai I've ever had. Throw in excellent server and a killer ambiance, and you've got one of Pittsburgh's greatest restaurants. I hope to see a few more entree selections in the future, but other than that, it's perfection!",

The cocktail specials are balanced. Hard drinkers can get a strong drink, lighter drinkers can get a sweet drink. Everyone wins.  Given the special, I'm willing to take risks and try anything.

The bar side, where I go almost every time is much more comfortable and cooler than before.   The drinks. I think they have a pretty decent cocktail and wine list. They are very well made and although expensive, pretty generous. Really like Laura the bartender. She is solid. The beers on tap are minimal and pretty safe bets with a few more to chose from by the bottle, but not a beer snob Mecca.   The food. I really enjoy places that spotlight small plates allowing you to try many things. I can't remember a small plate I did not like and can remember a few I wish would come back.....uhhh soft shells...  Usuall don't go for an entree but my wife and I split the filet one unadventurous night and it was delicious and very cleverly done.   It is expensive but very high quality and It's a great place to come alone, as a couple or a group. One of BB's gems.",

    "text": "This review is more general as opposed to a single visit, and applies to Soba post renovation.   Going here, the more expensive price is expected, and honestly worth it. I don't mind paying more money when the food is delicious, the service great on all levels, and the ambiance enjoyable. Soba achieves all three with flying colors. The first time I came with a large group and sat in the main dining area, and we were accommodated very well with fast flawless service. We ordered a variety of dishes and I can't say I disliked any. I normally hate tofu, but I even enjoyed the fried tofu dish. I've come back twice since then, to eat in the bar area. Whether the place was crowded or less busy, there was no variation in the high quality of food and the speed and friendliness of service, a rare accomplishment.   My advice for people coming here is to order a bunch of appetizers to share. The variety of flavors and foods is remarkable and it gives you a chance to experience the diversity this kitchen is capable of without investing a lot in one dish. That isn't to say that the entrees aren't also amazing, but this will help you have an idea of what you like best here and pick entrees that suit your tastes. But don't forget to make space for dessert. Their drink menu is also quite extensive, especially their offerings of a variety of sake to suit any dish or preference ranging from a standard carafe of warm sake to some limited edition bottles.   If you're in the mood for Asian food and want some great fusion cuisine, this is the place to go. It's also a great place for a date or happy hour with colleagues/clients. Happy eating!",

As soon as we entered we were asked if we wanted to sit at a table on the right, or at the bar. If want a lounge experience, I highly suggest going to the bar which has couches as well as bar seats (better for groups), if you want an intimate conversation (2-4 people), I suggest being seated to the right.  Food: We ordered the crispy tofu and mushroom & spinach dumplings for appetizers, the grilled salmon and spicy basil noodles for entrees, and shared the chocolate maki for dessert.  Crispy Tofu: Must eat for vegetarians or meat eaters. Cooked perfectly, with a tangy sauce  Mushroom & spinach dumplings: a little smaller than expected, but the red pepper dipping sauce did it in for us. The combination of flavors was great.  Spicy basil noodles: Seems pretty conventional to order here, but the waitress said that it was a \"signature dish.\" Pretty standard if you ask me, but nothing to complain about.  Chocolate Maki: We were excited for this, but unfortunately a tad disappointed. The pistachio cream and nuts were a great touch for the mousse, but the pistachio crepe had an awkward, rubbery taste to it.  Drinks: The management and staff have differing opinions on weather or not you can bring a drink (from the bar) to your table. To clarify: YOU CAN. Go ahead and order a drink at the bar (very good cocktails/martinis) and walk over to your table. If you're a gin drinker, I highly recommend the Bee Keeper (my favorite) and Gin Blossom. The bartenders aren't shy with alcohol, so keep that in mind.  Atmosphere & Service: The waitress was super helpful, and the atmosphere provided a good medium for a great conversation. Overall, great restaurant, but a little on the pricier side.",

Everything we ordered was delicious (nigori sake, crispy tofu, filet satays, double salmon roll, lobster roll, wild Alaska halibut, Long Island duck, vege fried rice, and banana split). The vege fried rice was a bit saltier than we expected, though. The chef even gave us an extra plate of salmon roll for the appetizer waiting time. The server suggested nigori sake (as we go sweet) and it was very nice. Amazing experience :-)",

The Korean ribs as appetizer were stale, NOT fresh by any means and overcooked. The tandoori salmon sounded and looked wonderful when it arrived and the salmon was cooked medium-rare, but I wasn't a fan of the overall dish and had to ask for lime, hot sauce, salt to be able to eat my meal. I was really hoping I would be blown away but unfortunately, I was not. However, others ordered different dishes which appeared delicious so maybe just don't order the Korean ribs or the salmon.",

    "text": "I stopped by here last night with my fiance and parents for dinner.  It had been awhile since the last time that I had visited Soba and it was nice to see that they had renovated the restaurant.  I have always found Soba to be a pretty cool place and these renovations have only helped.  One of the most distinct parts of the restaurant is a wall in the dining room that has water coming down it giving it a  waterfall-esque feel.  Beyond that there are three levels of dining which is pretty unique for Pittsburgh restaurants.  On this day we were seated on the second floor although I have eaten on all of them before.   Finally the bar section of the restaurant is also pretty cool with a nice bar and then the surrounding tables seated down pretty low to the floor which is probably to give it an Asian feel.  For dinner my fiance and I decided to start off the evening with the crispy tofu.  This is one of my favorite appetizers in Pittsburgh and it once again delivered.  I don't know how they get the tofu so crispy on the outside and yet still somewhat silky on the inside but they do consistently.  The dish is covered with a wonderful lemongrass sauce and garnished with some peanuts, scallions and jalepenos with the jalepenos being a new addition since the last time that I had tried it.  While I thought that the jalepenos added quite a bit to the dish, my mother, who normally doesn't handle any spice very well, did not and ended up with her mouth on fire.  For my entree I decided to go with the Dolsot Bi Bim Bap while my fiance went with the Pad Thai.  If you have never ordered dolsot bibimbap, the dish is served in an hot stone bowl with all of the ingredients on top of the rice and the rice against the bottom of the bowl which makes the rice crispy.  This version of bibimbap came with beef tips, poached egg, pickled shiitake, cucumber kim chi, mung bean sprouts, scallion, nori and goju jang.  While I enjoyed the general flavoring of my dish with everything mixed together, I was not too happy with a couple pieces of meat that were in my dish.  They were hard and if I had to guess, they had some tendon in them which is not what you are looking for whenever you are eating pre-cut beef tips.  Beyond my dish I was also able to try some of my fiances Pad Thai, specifically some shrimp from it.  It had some fabulous flavor with the slight natural sweetness of the shrimp combining with the taste of grilling.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back to Soba again in the future.  While this visit was not the best due to the beef tips (hence the four stars instead of the five stars I would have given on all previous visits), everything that I had still tasted good and I still think that Soba is in my top 5 list for restaurants in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere and service -- we sat on the second floor patio and it was well decorated. Temperature was cool with the awning but still received the warmth of the afternoon, so it was a nice balance. It was our server's second night on the job, but he did very well and was attentive to our table.  Cocktails -- we each had several different cocktails over the span of the night. My personal favorites were the Offer You Can't Refuse ($10) and the Bee Keeper ($11). Both were very drinkable and I could definitely have a few over dinner. I also tried the White Walker ($12) as any Game of Thrones fan would. I love smokey flavor and this had a great mezcal, but the jalapeno was a little too strong for my liking. It was great as a \"one and done\" cocktail. Definitely could not have more than one of these as it left a bit of a tingly sensation on your lips from the heat of the drink.   Appetizers -- the Rock Shrimp Tempura is DELICIOUS. I could order a couple plates of this and be completely satisfied for the night.   Entrees - The pad thai was so-so. I am partial to the Pad Thai at Nicky's Tai Kitchen, so it's hard for me to find a good runner up. The sauce was good, but I am also not used to having tofu in my pad thai so that threw me off a bit.   The Long Island Duck was very good. The Asian pear complimented very nicely and the sauce was amazing. Served with gnocchi, this was a great dish.   Overall was very pleased and will come back again.",

All in all, it was a delicious meal which is why I give it 4 stars.   The service was good, but nothing out of this world.   Unfortunately due to its ambiance and set up, our table was next to an obnoxiously loud table which caused us to not hang out and drink anymore cocktails. A little more space between tables would be nice, but it's not stoping me from going back.  Well done, Big Burrito!",

We started with drinks (old fashioned cider for me - a little cider wouldn't have killed you on this - I didn't order a cup of bourbon over ice) and a beer for the husband.  I also tried a sangria, but it was more kool-aid than wine.   Onto the food!  We started with three things - tuna maki, rock shrimp tempura the crab-corn chowder.  Each was absolutely amazing!  The tuna was super flavorful, the rock shrimp was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the chowder.  Wow.  I really want to go back and just bathe in the chowder.  It was spicy and crabby and super thick.  More like a corn milkshake.  Delish!  I had the seafood hot pot and J had the pad thai.  The pad thai was perfection.  My hot pot left me a little confused.  It sounded like soup, but came out in a weird bowl with like a thick mixture on the bottom not resembling soup broth.  The mussels were good, but small.  The scallops were amazing.  The fish cake was also very flavorful and not at all fishy, like I had had in prior fish cakes.  It wasn't that any distinct part wasn't good, it just wasn't what I was expecting.",

We started off with the spicy pork lettuce wraps, which were delicious last time!  This time, soooo salty.  Omg.  It was as if someone had spilled salt into the bowl.  Granted, it wasn't enough to be completely inedible, but it did sort of ruin the dish.  For the main course, I had my usual Bi Bim Bap and my wife had her usual tuna.  Her tuna was done perfectly.  They seem to have this nailed.  My bi bim bap was hot, but lacked any of the crispy, slightly dry rice around the outsides of the bowl.  It was all just regular-old, glutinous, freshly steamed rice.  For bi bim bap lovers, you know that the little added crunch and texture of that crusty rice really makes the dish!  We had an early reservation so we could make an early show.  My guess is that the kitchen hadn't quite \"gotten up to speed\" for the dinner rush yet.  Oh well.  I would still whole-heartedly recommend Soba, but this time was a miss.",

I can also recommend the Filet Mignon, which is prepared with chili garlic mashed potatoes, wild mushrooms, garlic soy,  and pea shoots.  Delicious.

I think it's overpriced for what it is, and I've been to Asian Fusion places that get it right too.  And just be careful, last time we got the chirashi bowl my boyfriend got food poisoning.

Maybe the green tea balanced out the alcohol-ness of vodka, but it tasted like juice.  For food, I started off with a lobster taco. The taco was really crispy and the lobster part itself was good.  Then I got a chirashi bowl. It came with avocados and parts of my avocado were brown and clearly overripe. There was something else that happened with the dish because it was quite salty, which isn't the Japanese way.  Overall: It doesn't matter to me whether a restaurant has a stylish interior.

When done right, it can be very delicious and exciting, but all I got from this was overpriced and mediocre food.  Service/Ambiance: I've got no complaints here. Excellent service. Hosts put our jackets in coat closets; waiters kept our glasses full and changed our plates for us without us even asking (We were sharing).  Food: Really a mixed bag.  - Rock Shrimp Tempura: No complaints on this one. Delicious. Fried to perfection. Tender fresh shrimp.  - Roasted Butternut Squash Dumplings: You honestly can't call this a dumpling. It's basically a fried fritter. Extremely chewy on the outside and I could barely taste the filling. Server recommended these, but it's really a shame to even call it a dumpling. Idea was great, execution not so much. - Chilean Sea Bass Satay: Could barely taste the miso, but the fish was quite yummy. Cooked well and tasted lovely. Would recommend this. - Korean Fried Chicken: Don't get this. Just go to Chik and Bubbly if you want Korean Fried Chicken. Coating was incredibly thick and hard to chew. It's not really crunchy as the double battered Korean style chicken should be. Marinade was also extremely mediocre and didn't taste very good. The balance on the pickled radishes was also poorly done. The acidity on them made my teeth uncomfortable.  - Winter Duck Lo Mein: It's basically confusion in a dish. Don't get this. Do not recommend it. No cohesion in the dish, doesn't really taste Asian. Duck was not well made, kind of stringy. Skin wasn't even crispy. Barely any noodles. None of the flavors seem to mix. While I do applaud the chef for trying to use seasonal ingredients, it was not done a cohesive manner.  - Sorbet Trio: Yuzu Cherry, Orange Pumpkin, Plum. Flavors in themselves are interesting and were really exciting. But the sorbets themselves? Really poorly made. Imagine eating a super sour popsicle that very icy and crunchy. That's what the sorbet is like here. Again balance on acidity and sweetness was not done well. It was as if there was no sugar in it. A properly made sorbet shouldn't be this icy. Had to hack at it a bit to get a spoonful  Overall, I wouldn't come back. This place is very pricey. While the ingredients are fresh, the execution did not showcase the ingredients well at all. It's a not-so-great take on Asian food. Doesn't really highlight the strengths of fusion. This place has potential, but for now, I do not plan to come back.  ALSO, please for the sake of the environment, don't use disposal chopsticks. It does not match with the venue and price of the restaurant, and it sucks for the environment.

    "text": "Came here on Friday night with reservations. The restaurant ambience is great. I started off with a lychee sangria that was light and refreshing with hints of lychee and lemon.  We had the rock shrimp tempura and Korean fried chicken bao buns. The shrimp tempura portion was huge and definitely sharable. It was nice and crispy and the sauce was a typical bang bang shrimp sauce. I had never had bao buns before and was so excited to try them! The buns were nice and soft and the fried chicken was so good. Definitely could have had another one.   We then shared the double salmon roll and the spicy tuna roll. For sushi, the pieces are pretty big. The double salmon roll had SO MUCH salmon in each piece. The spicy tuna roll also was very fresh fish.   Finally for dessert, we had the Thai ginger creme brulee. The ginger and thai flavors were a little overpowering for my liking but still a well made desert. Overall, would definitely come back to Soba! Every item we had was prepared well and tasted great. Just a bit on the pricier side.",

    "text": "Hubby and I visited Soba on a Friday night and sat out on the upstairs outside patio. Reservations were  no problem at 6:15 pm time, but by the time we finished our meal at 7:45 pm, the patio was filled.  I recommend trying a bunch of small plates for a dinner that includes experiencing the wonderful tastes and textures of foods that Soba provides!  We started with the Soba California roll, which didn't thrill me and was so much to share (8 pieces) that we had to cut back on some of our small plate selections.  Next we selected the rock shrimp tempora satay, which was equal to \"crispy shrimp\" appetizer at other restaurants.  Shrimp was succulent but small and a well enough portion for two to share.   The spicy pork and peanuts mixture for the lettuce leaf wraps had a kick and were quite tasty and very filling with the table accompanied soy sauce. Extra lettuce was available for the asking.  Last, the top winner in my book was the miso fish satay, with its soft buttery melt in your mouth texture was absolutely heavenly!  We ended with the sorbet of dessert sorbet. Raspberry, blueberry and lemon were the trio of flavors available that night. Not a fan of blueberry, we opted for two lemons instead. The round scoops were tough to break apart with our spoons to taste the 2 flavors together.  All of the other dessert selections looked delectable, but too filling for us at that point to try.  In retrospect, we would skip the California roll and opt to try the lobster tacos, corn and Chappelle  (mushroom) filled steamed dumplings or bao buns filled with pork and duck pate small plates.  There were so many small plate selections of delicious flavors to choose from, that will definitely be worth a second trip!  Service was attentive to begin with but waned in the later hour, especially for drink refills and getting the check. With some spicy dishes and the semi-humid (until the sun set) deck conditions, you need drinks filled quickly.  I blame this on the multi-rooms and multi-levels to serve because of the restaurant outlay.  It is easy to lose track of your tables and efficiently serve your patrons.  All in all, Soba offered a very cozy atmosphere coupled with great food to keep us coming back for more!  Well done!  One star less because of the slow service!",

    "text": "So my wife's birthday was approaching and I was trying to think of somewhere she hasn't been and I immediately thought of Soba as I had previously enjoyed a Yelp event there so I made reservations for dinner.   The decor inside is beautiful. Contemporary modern with an Asian flair. Once we arrived we were immediately seated. A few minutes later Robert, our waiter came with our menus and also told us about the specials of the day.  Since the Yelp event I had studied the menu and knew exactly what to start with. We started off with those amazing Korean Chicken Buns, Korean Barbecue Ribs and Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps. The chicken buns were incredible! The chicken had a crispy skin but was hot and juicy on the inside and went perfectly with that pillowy bun. The Korean Barbecue Ribs were just superb! Tender meat with a nice tangy sauce and the Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps were delicious as well!  For our entrees the birthday girl chose the Spicy Cantonese Beef Noodles which features beef tenderloin, rice noodles, basil, sprouts, garlic, local beans, scallion  and I chose the Korean Fried Chicken which is literally half of a chicken. The chicken was cooked the same way as the chicken in the bao bun was so it was outstanding! Perfectly seasoned with crispy skin on the outside and hot and juicy meat on the inside.  When I made the reservations I let them know that it was my wife's birthday and our waiter Robert let her chose any dessert for free so she chose the Chocolate Pretzel Stack. It features wonton pretzel chips, malted milk chocolate cream, miso caramel and kinako truffle. IT WAS EPIC! One of the best desserts we have ever had!  Robert was very patient with us as we had a lot of questions about the evenings entrees before we finally made a decision. He had a extensive knowledge of the food and was able to figure out what we would and would not like for our main entrees. He took excellent care of us the entire evening and made sure the we were never without a full glass or needed anything.  Soba is now one of our favorite restaurants and we both highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't been yet.",

I scraped the bbq sauce off, but the tuna had the texture of frozen. It was better with the sauce.   The place was lively, but full of people not easy on the eyes. I wound up paying $60 to sit near a dude in a beat up \"West Virginia\" tee and dirty Penguins baseball cap. There were a couple of older gentlemen with young dates, so an extra star for them.   A Port Authority bus stopped across the street covered in a large stencil of a bat, a baby, a dog, and a bird. \"Battery baby dog bird\"? Cool.   This is Shadyside, an old, nice neighborhood. Shadyside is fine dining from the 80s. It's worth driving--even inebriated--to Legume or Meat and Potatoes. Let's be real, you'd have to shoot someone for Pittsburgh Police to care.",

The water down the rock wall is amazing as we walked to the second floor.   Food was all good...I think our favorite was the crispy spicy tofu.  Don't be afraid of the peppers strewn on the tofu.  It's great.  And the mushroom pad thai was excellent too.  If I had one quibble, I'm not sure that I'd classify this as vegetarian friendly.  When we said 'vegetarian' just about the first thing the waitress asked was, 'so is fish ok?'  I expected a bit more understanding than that, and two of us ordered almost every vegetarian dish on the menu.  So, hard to go back and get anything different the next time, and if we were in a bigger group we would be doubling up on dishes if we were all sharing.  So--in my opinion, vegetarian friendly is a generous statement.  If I were Soba I might figure out how to add a few more items, maybe off menu.  But--still, love walking into that space!",

(A special shout-out to the lobster tacos. They are great. I especially love the peas in them.) Items I haven't enjoyed: pad thai, green mountain curry, lobster roll. Items that were just okay: long island duck, spicy pork lettuce wraps, banh mi bao buns, spicy tuna roll. One thing that seems to be consistent is the long wait time for your food to arrive. Once when I came for dinner, I recall having to wait 55 minutes for the food to come out. With interesting menu options, Soba is worth a try if you haven't been here before, but be careful with what you order and be prepared to wait a while for your food.

    "text": "I have always enjoyed going to Soba but the atmosphere is even more inviting and enjoyable now that they have renovated and expanded the restaurant.  It is still a bit pretentious more so than any of the other restaurants in the Big Burrito group, but I'm willing to overlook that because the food is so fantastic.  They always have a decent wine list, though on my most recent visit my friend and I were disappointed that they did not have a Reisling available by the glass.  She opted for the Louis Latour Pinot Noir and I opted for the amber cider which was delicious.  We shared the Lobster Roll which was fantastic though I have noticed that the size of the individual rolls are now almost half the size they were from about 2-3 years ago however they are still absolutely delicious.  For dinner we both ordered the Pad Thai which is always delicious choice particularly if you love Pad Thai - I've never had a bad dish of it here at Soba.  If you love spicy food be sure to ask them to bring the spice trio of chili sauces with your meal.  Some of my other favorite items on the menu are: the crispy tofu - many times when I've dined alone in the lounge area I've ordered the crispy tofu and the seaweed salad - it's a nice light dinner option and probably the best tofu that I've eaten at a restaurant - great option for vegetarians.  The corn chowder has a bit of a kick to it, is full of complex flavors and the crab is always tender and fresh.  The Korean bbq ribs literally melt in your mouth - my sister-in-law is Korean and makes the family Korean bbq when her and my brother visit from California and it's always delicious, but Soba's Korean bbq ribs blow my sister-in-law's out of the water - they will make your mouth water.  If you like steak, then the filet mignon with the chili garlic mashed potatoes will have you in heaven.  I only eat beef a handful of times each year and typically it is on my birthday when I indulge in Soba's filet or on occasion when I'm at Eleven and order the Eleven burger.  The duck is also spectacular and I would highly recommend it as well.  You honestly cannot go wrong with almost anything on their menu.  The food is consistently fresh and delicious!  I will definitely return to Soba time and again.",

The seats were comfortable and the pace of the service let you know that you could stick around a while and enjoy yourself.  The food isn't as Asian as I expected it but still delicious. I went with the filet mignon and it melted in my mouth like butter. The sprouts on top gave it a nice, fresh crunch.  The service was spectacular, as it should be for this type of establishment. My only real complaint is that after having been to Kaya and Eleven, I feel Soba could diversify their menu a bit. A few of their dishes can be found on its brother's menus and I don't think they're quite capturing Eastern food.  Either way, it's delicious.",

The lounge was everything it was advertised to be. Many different options of where to sit and a beautiful ambiance that really put us in the right mood. As soon as we sat down we were handed a drink menu with all sorts of options. Went with the Bangkok Tea, was delicious. Now why did I give it 2 stars? Everything sounds great right? Wrong!! The server went out of her way to make us feel uncomfortable. Kept walking over to ask us if we wanted anything else (I ordered 2 drinks while my date got 1). She didn't leave us alone and didn't hide the fact that she wanted us to leave. What's the big idea. At the end she closed our bill early and said that we should tell her if we need anything else. That was our sign to leave. What a way to ruin an otherwise beautiful evening. So my advice to anyone coming to soba at around 6:30pm on a Tues is to watch out for Ashley. Hopefully it was just an off day for her, but it definitely ruined our evening.",

    "text": "Hit up Soba for Valentine's day.  We were late making reservations so I stalked Open Table for an opening all day and finally got an opening.   The ambiance is great, though we were seated next to a patio that's closed for the season, so we had the least romantic spot in the house with views of chairs turned over on tables and a leafy concrete.  We have ordered the rock shrimp tempura before and it was really our reason for heading to Soba on Valentine's Day.  We joked on the way that we should just order 3 plates, but when our dish arrived this night, the batter was browned, the lemons (normally insanely good) were unevenly cooked, chewy and bitter instead of crispy and melt-in-your-mouth.  The shrimp were half the size they'd been the last time we'd ordered and a little chewy as well.  Still worth a try because when they are good, they are crazy good.  We got the shrimp spring rolls but they were dripping with grease and just plain dull and disappointing.  The shrimp was undetectable and the vegetables soggy.  The homemade mustard and duck sauces were delicious but not enough to redeem the dish.  Though we had room for dessert, we only managed to eat one egg roll between the two of us, picked at a second one and took the third home, but it found it's way into the trash.  For half the price, you'll find more satisfaction with some old school egg rolls at your run of the mill Asian eatery.    The fried rice was a nice sized plate and the shrimp in this dish were cooked beautifully.  The bok choy was a great addition, but the plate did cry out a bit for a drizzle of sauce of some kind.  It was a little bit of a disappointing visit, but we'll probably give it a try again sometime.",

As in no service and when our orders were taken they were all screwed up with missing entrees, missing drinks, and we waited at least 45 minutes for our food.  No, we did not order any super fancy dishes.  I don't know whose fault it was- the waiter or the kitchen or what but it was really really bad and I eat out all over the country all the time.  Worst service I've had in years and I'm a moderately tolerant fella.  Lost 3 stars for that.  Assuming the service was superb I'd give the food a 3/5.  Slightly above average.  I know this is supposed to be one of pittsburgh's best, and yes I am in Pittsburgh in the middle of \"why does anyone live here???\" which has zero michelin starred restaurants, but damn, it was not that great.  The interior design was also nice.  Good ambiance.  Best thing about the place- they have free vallet parking.  The lot was filled with Audis and bimmers and maseratis but the valets cheerfully took and parked my spectacular status symbol 1989 dodge grand caravan minivan.  They got the tip.",

The first time was the \"Water Festival\" that was fabulous.  The second time was for Valentines weekend.  I like the tasting menu because it forces me to try things that I wouldn't normally order.  I am not a fan of the gamey taste of lamb or the texture of scallops and mushrooms....but when its done right, like it is at Soba, I fall in love and realize what I am missing.  My BF and I usually order one of each item and switch back and forth so we get to taste 7 dishes in all.   Highly recommend the tasting menu.",

Soba was one of the few places in the area that was able to accomodate a Friday night reservation for that many people in a short time, so that was great.  The drinks are good, and the wine list is decent.  We were there at Happy Hour time, but you have to go to the bar yourself for the Happy Hour offerings and prices, which was a little annoying but not a big deal.  However, my husband ordered the Manhattan off of the Happy Hour menu, but the bartender made him the regular one, which was twice the price, even though he pointed to the HH one.  Not sure where the miscommunication was there, but then the bartender did not offer to remake or take back the incorrect drink.  Again, not a huge issue, just a little grievance.  Overall the food was just ok, I did not find it specatcular to warrant 5 stars.  Casbah is still our go-to restaurant in the Big Burrito group, but Soba is nice for a change.",

I was talking to my friend about my lack of knowledge of white wine when our waiter came over to fill up our waters.  He asked if I wanted to learn about white wines and offered us a tasting of 3 varieties. He had us try them without telling us what they were. The thoughtfulness and interest in pairing our wines with our dinner really made our night.  We started off with the crispy tofu, which I always get, and this time did not disappoint.  I had the mushroom and rice cake noodles and my friend had the seared tuna.  Both dishes were great, aside from the kim chi on my friend's plate that was not very good. My dish was on the spicy side, so make sure to ask about spice level if that concerns you.",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me out to dinner at Soba Lounge for my birthday last week!  We had reservations for 7 pm on a Thursday evening, and had an absolute hell of a time parking!  How does anybody live in this neighborhood?  It's maddening.  The lot next to Soba was full, and there's only one way in/out, so it was pretty much impossible to get out of after we realized it was full - don't even bother, just drive around until you find street parking somewhere.  Our disgruntled-ness quickly wore off when we stepped inside.  Dimly lit, sleekly decorated, and filled with a sense of Zen and calm, my boyfriend noted that it reminded him of the restaurants in Chicago.  High praise!  We followed our server upstairs, past a peaceful wall-waterfall, and to our elegant table.  There was a medium-size crowd at Soba that night, consisting oddly of mostly older people and businessmen - not many twenty somethings in sight!  That was a bit surprising, but fortunately the noise level was low, giving Soba a feeling of intimacy - great for a date!  Our server was friendly, perky, and quick to recommend her favorite dishes.  She was the kind of server who, if you wanted her to, would stop at your table to chat for a few minutes, but if you'd rather she was unobtrusive and quick, she could do that too.  I started with a cocktail, the Gin Blossom, and my boyfriend got something with Drambuie that isn't on the menu anymore.  I LOVED mine - it was purple!  It was very floral and sweet, perfect for me.  Just strong enough too - I sipped it throughout the whole meal.  We started with the grilled baby octopus, which actually was great!  The texture was meatier than we expected - I think we anticipated the rubbery, chewiness of calamari.  But it was great!  The legs (tentacles?) were lined with grill marks and the meat had a salty, savory taste.  And the aioli that lined the plate?  Creamy and delicious.  Next, we enjoyed the lobster maki with pistachios and mango - it was delicious and fresh, presented very simply.  A bit pricey for what you get, but we enjoyed it nonetheless.  For my entree, I had the sea scallops with BBQ pork, and it was pretty wonderful.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, and I mean PERFECTLY.  The pork underneath was flavorful and tender - a bit salty, but at least it wasn't bland!  The rice cake noodles were deliciously glutinous and chewy.  It was a good size portion as well - I couldn't quite finish it after the two appetizers we shared, so I had to take a bit home. Boyfriend got the pad thai, and I found it a little disappointing in that it was indistinguishable from takeout pad thai.  Good takeout, but still - it didn't seem heightened in any way.  Which is fine, I guess, but for $19?  Whoa.  No.  He was satisfied with it, but I was disappointed since it was a special occasion and his meal definitely wasn't of birthday caliber.  At least it was my birthday and not his!  I think generally the food here is very good, and the atmosphere is upscale and intimate.  I'd stick with the dishes that are complex and unique.  Don't go here and get the pad thai.  But you won't be disappointed by the exotic offerings!",

So to have the same prices in the 'Burgh, the \"Most Livable City,\" I would expect to be knocked off my feet.  Or, maybe, I'm just a cheap bastard.  I tried all the appetizers, and they were all excellent.  The portion sizes for both the appetizers and the entrees were generous.  The spring rolls, crabcakes, spinach dumplings, et al. come with 6 servings each.  I think most people enjoyed their entrees.  I had the seared tuna, which was a big piece.  It was prepared pretty well, and had nice sides of pickled cucumbers and kim chi.  The sides were really good -- but I've also had these items store-bought, and they tasted almost as good.  Service was excellent and the waitstaff was nice and accomodating.  I also appreciated the decor and atmosphere, something I normally don't prioritize.  It's definitely a swanky place.  In short, very good food, but for me, who averages $13/hr for my salary, I'd rather eat somewhere with a better price/taste ratio.",

The host was a chipper fellow who whisked our coats away and took us to our cozy nook on the second tier in full view of the slate waterfall cascading down the full length of the 3 story restaurant.  I was mesmerized.    Our waitress was a sophisticated, demure lady who catered to our every need and helped us navigate the wonderfully creative menu.  We were given yummy complimentary scallop appetizers over baby veggies.  My sister and I immediately looked at each other and knew this was gonna be goodddddd...  I would spell out every dish and how friggin' awesome it was but I'll post pictures instead...even the one of me crying at the end of the meal.  Be sure to read the captions...  The bathroom was gorgeous showcasing cutting-edge design concepts which had me convinced there was a hidden camera shooting me for the next \"Bold look of Kohler\" commercial (in the non-creepiest way...I do realize I'm talking about hidden cameras in a public bathroom).  I might have scoffed at my little sister for going to school in a sketchy place like Pittsburgh, but quite honestly, I just need to shut up and visit her more often.",

We didn't have reservations but there was some seating available and we opted to sit outside since the weather was gorgeous.  I have never been here before and was really impressed with the decor! The outside seating area was my favorite part of the whole dining experience. Comfortable chairs, lights strung across the ceiling, the most pleasant breeze and a view of the sky (which at the time was a mix of pinks and reds).

There were definitely good points. The service was great, and I enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered off the menu. Also, they had a couple of lesser-known cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing. The wine by the glass menu had nice choices, too.  Unfortunately, the food was mixed. I had the pork dumplings for an appetizer. The combination of flavors in the filling, dip and wrapper was very good, but the wrapper was unusually thick and distractingly chewy, even gummy (as in, it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy). The server said they'd just started making their wrappers in-house, and I think they need some work.  I had the chicken ramen soup for a main course. It just wasn't very good. I didn't expect it to be up to Vancouver BC standards (that city seems to have a thing for ramen), but the noodles were a bit tough, and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt. This includes the broth and the chicken. I didn't really want to eat it; I just tried the leftovers, and I don't really want to eat them either.  If the food were at 2/3 to 3/4 of the price I'd give it three stars. As it is, I wish I'd gone somewhere else. Clearly, other people love the place. Maybe I'll give it another chance, if I'm with friends who want to go.",

    "text": "I have dinned Soba on multiple occasions and it never disappoints.  I really like the decor (very fitting for menu served) and the wait staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. Since my standard practice is to ask what their favorite dishes and the most popular dishes are, a waitress/waiter that can give a detailed response is a big plus.    The wine menu is very thorough and my wife and i can always find a bottle that is both of high quality and reasonably priced.  For apps, we usually split the grilled baby octopus, if you have never had it, i highly suggest it.   I was a little surprised on my most recent visit that they have removed the Sea Scallop entree from the menu,  my wife and i had both planned on getting this meal that evening.  I hope it returns soon, however, and a big however, the scallops were replaced with the miso black cod, which was absolutely fantastic.  one of those meals where eat bite is better than the next, the bbq ribs and noodles remain from the scallop dish but i believe there was a llittle more spice in this dish.  I also believe this is the famous miso black cod from next door at Umi, i could be wrong.   get this entree, it is amazing.    In summary, Soba is great for a nice meal out, food is top notch, some of the best you will find in Pittsburgh, and of course i will return soon, yet again.",

The food was spectacular and the drinks and service were first class.  My wife had the whole bronzini, which I tried some of, and it was dynamite. Don't let the whole fish preparation intimidate you!  My entree was the seared tuna and it was quite good as well.  We enjoyed a great pinot noir that was recommended by our waiter and also had some great sparkling sake.  We waited for our table in the lounge and tried some cocktails -- all receive high marks.  We were seated near the water feature wall, which is a spot I would recommend. The lighting, mood, food, and service make this a great location if you're looking to impress or have a nice romantic evening.  I look forward to a return visit.",

    "text": "My first trip to Soba was as a +1 at a Yelp Elite event (yay!).  The event occupied the bar area, which was lovely, had ample seating, and a beautiful (well stocked) bar.  The food and drink provided was well designed to represent some of the better tastes of the menu.  We chose a poor table, and tended to get the ends of each service, but ultimately, we were well fed and pampered by the end.  The shishito peppers were truly outstanding.  Lovely and smokey, but not too spicy.  The rock shrimp tempura and seared rare tuna were tasty and definitely worth getting, but the highlight (for me) was the bao buns.  Dear Lord. The dough was light and soft, the chicken deliciously fried, and then my brain kinda melted into nirvana rather than thinking about the other ingredients.  We also sampled the edamame, spicy tuna roll and a vegetarian roll, which were good, but sort of as expected and not my favorite.  We also sampled the plum sangria (very tasty), the thai mule (very gingery, delicious, and my favorite!!), and the midnight manhattan (amazing, if you're a rye drinker).  For dessert, we all received a chocolate maki, which was very creative, well presented, and good.  A nearby yelper had a birthday, which called for a soba banana split.  After the banana split, which was truly outstanding, we were all left a big jealous.   Also of note, their happy hour specials were good.  A nice selection of reasonably priced cocktails, wine, beer, and beer on tap.  I would definitely come back for a nice dinner sometime!",

Soba's staff has cured me of that. Food was good not great and my server acted as though my table of one was a bother even though I spent 60 bucks and ate within an hour with a 20% tip. My co workers were interested in checking this place out before we all head back to Los Angeles but I'll let them all know it's not worth a visit.

    "text": "I went to Pittsburgh for the first time to visit my friend and we were trying to choose a restaurant for dinner.  Like I do when I visit any new city, I researched the best restaurants in the city based on yelp, food websites and word of mouth.  My friend and I came across Soba as a highly regarded restaurant.  Friends who live in Pittsburgh mentioned that Soba was a great choice.  The interior of Soba reminded me of a restaurant in NYC.  The inside looks very modern with a lot of wood and glass material and is spacious with multiple floors.  There is complimentary valet parking at Soba which makes parking easy.    We chose the crispy calamari as an appetizer and shared the thakkali curry and pad thai for the entrees.  The crispy calamari was okay - similar to crispy calamari I had at other restaurants.  The thakkali curry was very salty and there was not enough liquid to balance out all the vegetables.  We had trouble eating the curry as the sauce was very pungent.  The pad thai was nothing spectacular - definitely had better in NYC and Philadelphia.  The portion sizes of all the food that we ordered were very generous.  I did not appreciate the lighting in the restaurant as it was very dark and I could barely read the menu or tell what was in my food.  Unfortunately, we may have ordered the wrong food as we heard such great reviews about Soba.",

Best dessert we've ever had.   Speciality drinks were pretty outstanding too....thanks Soba!!",

We tried their farm feast tasting menu event for $35 per person, including four courses. You may also accompany the courses with a wine paring for $20, giving you four different types of wine with each serving. We thought the cost was a great value.  The thing I love most about a tasting menu is that you don't have to worry about decisions. The menu is already planned. I'm sure many people would have an issue with this, but as a foodie, there is nothing better than to experience new cuisines. If you are one of those picky people, you can order off Soba's Japanese-fusion style menu.  Because we were blown-away from the atmosphere, outstanding service, and talented chefs, Soba made our Pittsburgh Favorite list at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.GirlLikesToEat.com%2F%2Fpittsburghfavorites%2F&s=4e5a5ba727adf740ae9ab40152fa4f41b48e19f8a9843e314d319cf7ce84d445\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">GirlLikesToEat.com//pitt...</a>  This is for sure an exquisite dining experience.",

I arrived a little before she did and checked in for the evening! I was greeted by the kindest hostess who offered to check my coat (bonus!) and gave me the option to wait in the lounge or right there in the receiving area. Both were elegant and beautiful! Once my friend arrived, we were quickly seated. I would definitely recommend making a reservation because it seemed that everyone who came in had and the place was packed by 6pm!   We started with celebratory cocktails, of course! She enjoyed the khalessi while I enjoyed the Asian plum sangria. I really loved my drink and she enjoyed hers as well. Mine was sweet while hers had notes of orange bitters.   We shared the rock shrimp tempura as an appetizer and that was probably my favorite thing of the night! Crispy, flavorful - it had it all. Then we also shared an order of the pad Thai, a lobster taco, as well as the spicy tuna roll. Both of these were amazing as well! The pad Thai features chicken, shrimp, and tofu! The sushi was just excellent. By the time we had finished sharing all of these things, I was stuffed. Portions are not skimpy! BUT, It was a birthday, so dessert was in order! We ordered the chocolate pretzel stack and it was to die for! A rich, creamy mousse with a crunchy pretzel crust and a caramel drizzle. We could barely finish half of it because it was so rich!   Protip: if it's a birthday, sign up for emails from the big burrito company and you can get a coupon to soba for a complimentary entree up to $30! (Most entrees on their menu are not more than that)   We were fortunate enough to be able to walk there, but they do offer valet parking if you don't want to attempt driving to Ellsworth.   There are still several menu items I want to sample and I can't wait to go back!",

It was hard not to with the amazing decor (I kid you not, one entire wall is a water feature; it was insane). With the dark lighting I knew I was in for a fancy meal.  We ordered the rock shrimp tempura as an appetizer. It was very spicy, but I enjoyed it. Somehow the tempura batter stayed crispy after it had been tossed in the sauce.  We split a spicy tuna roll with the pad Thai. The sushi was fresh and bright. It was a great tuna roll! The pad Thai was also very yummy; the sauce was the perfect consistency that coated every noodle--it was just as pad Thai should be. I didn't enjoy the texture of the chicken that much, but that is probably just a personal preference. I wish I could've switched out the protein though!  The best part of our meal was the service. It was my birthday, and when we ordered the chocolate pretzel stack for dessert (very richly chocolately, loved the crunchy pretzel bits, but far too rich to finish) and it didn't arrive with a candle, our waitress went to get me one within seconds. It was that touch that really made the meal special.",

The entree I ordered was labeled as Lobster and Shrimp Lo Mein it was far from it. It tasted like buttered noodles with some fancy seafood on top which also lacked flavor. I was super disappointed while this was my birthday dinner.   The only good thing about the whole meal was dessert the Coffee Cardamom creme brulee was actually delicious.

We ordered the spicy pork lettuce wrap -- the spicy pork was just spicy, and no other taste in it. The lettuce was not fresh, more seemed old.. The one u can get from pf chang is a lot better! The dumplings r definitely better to get from the actual asian restaurant, and not at a fake asian like soba lol. The soup in the steamed dumplings is the key, but it was already ripped lost all its soup when we got our dish. The teriyaki glazed salmon was also just alright. Definitely not worth the price. The one I got from Soju was a lot better than this, and it was also cheaper. Very disappointed in foods overall.  Dessert was fine. The decoration of chocolate maki was pretty creative and I rly liked it in general. Their house ice cream was delicious but the portion was incredibly small. Not worth $12.  The service isnt that great either. One server seems to take care of 5-6 tables at once. Our server literally left us w the menu for 20 minutes. Never came back to check on us so we had to tap him on his way to serve the others. This happened MULTIPLE times. Didnt even ask whether we want the dessert menu before we asked for the check. The service wasnt worth 20%. Not even 15%.  I dont think im ever going back lol My review was from my $100 experience so i hope no one wastes their $100 to get the same experience",

I'm slowly making my way through the entire Big Burrito Restaurant Group joints, and Soba is now at the top of that list! I went with a friend for Belated Birthday drinks and dinner. We opted to sit in the lounge, which was cozy yet classy. We usually decide on an appetizer to split. After leveraging my birthday, we ordered Char Siu Ribs. The 5 Spice Barbeque really piqued my interest. They were incredible. While I would have liked it to be a tad bit more 5-Spice Forward, I can't say it ruined the dish. The ribs were so huge and juicy and tender, a pleasure to sink your teeth into.  We decided on drinks; I ordered a Thai Mule, she ordered a Red Manhattan. I love Mules. I love Thai Spices. I was pleased that the combination of those two things was an excellent pairing. Her Red Manhattan was pretty sweet, but the perfect choice for the \"Girly Drink\" lover you may know. Now, on to Entrees. I debated for a while here, but landed on the Shrimp and Lobster Lo Mein (Egg noodles, uni butter, swiss chard, shallots, marcona almonds, caviar). It was a glorious Bolero of flavors: Those juicy hunks of shrimp and lobster melded seamlessly with the perfectly cooked swish chard and the delicate egg noodles. Truly, an outstanding dish. My friend ordered the Shaking Beef: (Filet mignon medallions, jasmine rice, heirloom tomato, arugula, hot mustard). She did NOT share! She said it was very good though! We ordered a final round of drinks: White Lychee Sangria and Asian Plum Sangria. Both were just superb.  I really enjoyed my experience here. Soba is a wonderful spot to go for a flavorful meal or drink!",

We arrived arrived early and the hostess was very accommodating. Our table wasn't ready but she personally escorted us to the bar area to wait. Bar area had an awesome vibe to it. Big open doors, couches to relax on and your typical Kygo type music. The minute I walked in the bar I said to my wife \"I can't believe I haven't been here before. This place is pretty awesome.\" Halfway through our drink the hostess came over and told us our table is ready. She picked our drinks up for us and took them over to the table. The rest of the night we just kept ordering food in waves and brought it out to share for the table. Everything tasted amazing. Service from the bar area to the waitress was impeccable. Always seemed to stop back at the table at the exact right time. I would highly recommend this place especially for a date or if you're impressing someone on business. Two thumbs up and can't wait to go back.",

We were late for our reservation because we're bad at estimating traffic delays, but the service was still accommodating and friendly!   The inside is very hip and loungey, with tables accommodating couples up to large tables for bigger groups (there was a group of 10-12 people while we were there, and several groups of 8).  For drinks we had the plum and lychee sangrias. The plum sangria was super festive looking and both drinks were tasty and presented nicely! To start, we had the chicken spring rolls and crab corn chowder. The spring rolls came out fresh and hot with a sweet/spicy dipping sauce and the soup was hearty and warm!   For our meal, I got the bulgogi bibimbap and he got the chirashi bowl and a side of stir fried bok choy and mushrooms. The bulgogi was definitely huge - full of seaweed strips, marinated mushrooms, beef, bean sprouts, egg, etc. The chirashi bowl was beautiful and the fish was delicious. While everything was super tasty and filling, it was a bit salty for our taste and we packed some of the stuff to go.   Portion sizes were generous, so we didn't have room for dessert! Next time :)",

Favorites : crispy tofu ,  pumpkin curry when in season or any of their Thai dishes, and their Thai mule cocktail.   Ambience is this swanky chic lounge in the back first come first serve that is a beautiful area to kick back before going out, as we always did. Reminds me of the Delano hotel bar in Miami. Bartenders are great. Lounge Service can be hit or miss if it's busy. Dining section, service is always great!   Overall, great atmosphere, good food, and awesome cocktails. Can't go wrong.

So fresh, very sizable portion, and plain out delicious. The Pork dumplings were good too! For my entree I had the Thai chicken curry, and it was so good! Definitely a dish that takes your taste buds on an adventure. I actually got stuffed on the appetizers so I actually basically took my meal home. I would love to go back, but I honestly would probably order two or three orders of sushi because it was so delicious!  I do recommend making reservations, as it did get busier as the night went on. They sat us on the quieter side of the restaurant, as I had no idea that the restaurant has so many different seating rooms!",

I ordered two appetizers and a main course. They didn't have a whole lot of veg options but the ones they had looked totally delicious so I didn't mind! I got crispy tofu. Came with jalapenos, cilantro and peanuts! A bit spicier than I expected but it was actually incredible. The sauce with the slight sweetness, spice and cilantro was amazing. The peanuts neutralized it perfectly. It was a huge bowl. I couldn't even finish half!  For my second appetizer, I ordered the squash dumplings. You can either steam them or fry them and I chose steamed. Really good, also surprisingly spicy. The squash and mushrooms actually went well together and the sauce added a salty flavor. There was an appropriate amount of this appetizer.  I ordered a completely vegetarian version of the pad thai. They have a vegetarian suace they sub it with and even include vegetables. I thought it was pretty tasty. I got very nervous because of how insanely large it was! I felt like I could have fed at least 3 other people with what I was attempting to tackle. I liked it but maybe cut down on the size!  The service was just okay. Very friendly but also very slow. We waited a long time without water which was not pleasant with the surprisingly spicy food.",

    "text": "Just had dinner at Soba with the girlfriend and two friends.  It was a disappointment from top to bottom as we were excited for a very good asian infused dinner but instead experienced an average at best night out.    At first we were greeted instantly by our server and things started off fine.  However once we placed our drinks it took the staff, I kid you not 25 minutes to make and bring 4 drinks. They would have never been brought if the manager didnt approach the table and ask if everything was ok.  After he finally brought them with the time in mind he did comp our round which was a nice gesture.  The appetizers, which mind you were brought out BEFORE the drinks, without any staff paying attention that fact.  Apps were the best part of the meal.  Korean BBQ Ribs, were dry and really needed the extra bbq sauce to make the rib succulent and still the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. The Rock Shrimp was excellent, very light batter, fantastic lightly spicy sauce and spiced well. same shrimp as Umi.  The Softshell crab was pretty good, the heirloom tomatoes and avocado added a nice touch and the crab was prepared perfectly, soft and a good crisp crunch.   What really hurt this experience were the entrees. I had ordered the Double Cut Pork Chop and ordered it cooked t o the chefs suggestion in preparation when it came out, it was a tough pork chop, noticeable without even cutting into it.  I dealt with it and continued to eat it but overall a tough and dry dish.  The accompaniments such as snap peas, lotus root and mushrooms just seemed very thrown together, and didnt add anything to the taste of the dish, did not mesh well. My friend ordered the Roasted Chicken which was a variation of a chicken ramen soup.  For $22 a ramen entree should be out of this world and it was far from that, and it was work to get the dish into ready condition to be consumed. The girls ordered shareable sushi offerings and found them to be just ok nothing greater than they have had at good sushi restaurants.    The service was lacking all around our meal.  Apparently it was \"Jam on Walnut St Festival\" which meant that many checked out the soba bar for drinks.  However when I went to the restroom and passed by it looked like a normal bar scene to me.  Not only did our beverages take 25 minutes to arrive.  The waiter never checked up on us after app or entree until we were obviously ready for the table to cleared and when I was served my pork chop I still was left with a butterknife to cut this tough piece of meat.  Had to ask server for a steak knife, which was clearly meant to be served with this dish.  When the girls got their shareable entrees the dumpings they ordered were replaced by shittake mushroom dumplings when they ordered shrimp.    The ambience of the restaurant is nice but some of our party had trouble seeing as it is extremely dim all around making it tough to read and even see your dish.  There was a lot of cell phones out at tables around us for flash light usage.  I wouldn't return to Soba it just does not offer enough for me to justify the cost and it looks like right now they are having trouble serving dinner on a saturday night.",

    "text": "This was the last stop on the \"Brother Visits Ne'er Do Well Kid Sister and Treats Her to Meals\" tour.  We started with the Indonesian corn fritter wraps, which were delicious with the chili-soy dipping sauce.  The corn fritters should have either been a little smaller or the lettuce leaves a little bigger, however, because the combo to unwieldy to roll up and eat.  The seaweed salad was good, too.  My entree was the autumn vegetables and rice cake noodles--which I only realized was very similar to a pasta dish at Casbah after I took my first bite.  The dish at Casbah: maccheretto with white beans, wild mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, cheese and walnuts.  Soba's version: rice cake noodles with wild mushrooms, butternut squash, green beans, arugula and sunflower seed pesto.  The types of vegetables in Casbah and Soba's versions differ, but the pestos taste pretty much the same.  Rice cake noodles don't really soak up liquid, though, so Soba's version was drowning in sauce.  I probably would have enjoyed another entree more.  I guess I should have read the menu description more carefully, but didn't think Asian fusion (Soba) and Mediterranean (Casbah) were anything alike, so I didn't expect to get the same dish at both restaurants.  For dessert, we split the five spice apple tart with honey creme fraiche and crispy yam.  The tart was more honey creme fraiche with some apple bits on top; it was tasty but I would have liked more apple.  I enjoyed the atmosphere on a Sunday night, and our server was pleasant but didn't hover.  The food's delicious--just order carefully if you've dined at another Big Burrito restaurant not too long ago, to avoid getting a similar dish.",

Chopped salad with mango, avocado, lettuce, cilantro was light and refreshing and perhaps the best part of the meal. Entrees were the black cod and the seafood stew.  Black cod was cooked well but the sauce lacked something - it could have tasted delicate and light but instead tasted charred.  The seafood in the stew was cooked well - scallops, shrimp and mussels were done perfectly - but again the broth lacked something to brighten it. Service and ambiance were nice.  For a young hip vibe I would ask for downstairs seating. All in all I would say the food was very good, not great. We will try again in the summer with a different menu.",

    "text": "After several incredible experiences at UMI, I decided to give Soba (next door) a shot.   The design of the place is awesome. Definite 5 star for ambiance; unfortunately the food did not fair as well.  chicken and vegetable springrolls: hot mustard sauce, nuoc chom - these were tasty but the description fails to mention that they are fried and a bit too oily. The nuoc chom sauce that accompanied the dish was possibly the highlight of the meal. Like a very light sweet and sour.The hot mustard was passable but nothing special  calamari: chilies, toasted garlic, mint, uni emulsion -I was hoping for a raw or lightly grilled calamari presentation, I guess I should have asked. Again, soba fails to mention these are fried.  As fried calamari go..these were delicious. The uni emulsion was more of an uni-mayo sauce..and the chilies/toasted garlic/mint sprinkled along side added some great flavor.   wild barramundi: sushi rice cake, summer vegetable ratatouille, ssam jang, thai basil -I liked the flavor of the fish, the rice cake and vegetable ratatoille, however; they were all too oily. I'd like a light sear on the fish, but this was like a deep pan fry on one side. Veggies were a bit to oily as well. The ssam jang was too vinnegary in my opinion.   vegetarian pad thai: zucchini, green beans, bok choy, tofu, peanuts, mung bean sprouts, cilantro -rather bland and again absolutely soaked in oil.   Service was acceptable, but nothing special.   Overall, I much, much prefer UMI and can't wait until Mr. Shu get's back from vacation. I probably won't be back to Soba, I'll opt for Tamari if I'm in a fusion mood.",

    "text": "Soba delivered again! One of the perks of being on the Big Burrito mailing list is the postcard they send every year at your birthday time for a free entree. I like to celebrate my birthday with some good food in the company of friends, so I usually select a restaurant and invite a few folks to join me. Tuesday night eight of us met at Soba for what turned out to be a truly lovely evening.   We had great service from go. The staff is very professional, yet willing to engage. We were seated on the top level, which was quite nice because it was quiet and there were only a few other tables aside from ours.   The roasted beet salad ($10) was a nice start. Golden and red beets were thinly sliced and piled with arugula, cortland apples, a very pretty light pink radish with green skin, cashews, and dressed with ginger vinaigrette. Others around the table enjoyed the chopped salad, tuna tartar, spicy tuna maki, and the calamari. There were no complaints and many a plate circumnavigated the table. Several of the group commented that the calamari were particularly good.  There are currently three veg options on the menu, and it was a hard choice:  * red curry tofu: wild mushrooms, yellow wax beans, yu choy, fried cauliflower, carrots, chickpeas, basil, steamed jasmine rice ($17) * autumn vegetable and rice cake: butternut squash, chanterelles, apples, spinach, fermented black beans, miso butter, pine nuts ($17) * spicy pumpkin and basil noodles: shiitake, baby bok choy, peanuts, fried egg ($17)  I finally chose the noodles with the spicy pumpkin and basil sauce. The dish was pleasantly spicy and I liked the addition of the egg. I would have liked the bok choy to be cut a little smaller and the shitakes cut a little bigger, but these are very small complaints about an otherwise very enjoyable dish.  My mother when with the autumn vegetables and rice cakes, which really weren't \"cakes\" at all, but more like small balls (about the size of a gnocci) made out of rice noodles. It was \"too spicy\" for her, but I really can't tell you what she meant because it is not spicy at all. It had a bit of a smoky rustic flavor and no spiciness whatsoever. All I know is that the rest of her dish is now in my fridge which I will be enjoying later.   Dessert started out as a hard sell to my dining companions, but I had saved room--this was my birthday dinner after all! What's a birthday dinner without \"cake\"!?! I went with the chocolate maki: dark chocolate mousse wrapped in a  chocolate pistachio crepe and sliced to looked like a maki roll. A small pile of pistachio cream sat next to it looking like wasabi and the \"pickled ginger\" was really thing slices of cantaloupe. A small pot of chocolate sauce mimicked soy for dipping. T'was rich and fine, however, being the ginger fiend that I am, I really wished they had used real pickled ginger!  Others shared the chocolate pretzel stack, consisting of wonton 'pretzel' chips, malted milk chocolate cream, miso caramel, and a kinako truffle. My spoon may have found it's way into that pile up and I was impressed. the \"pretzel\" was really tasty and the malted chocolate cream complemented it well. My mother and I both agreed that the miso caramel was amazing, and while mom's concept of \"spicy\" may be questionable, her judgment of things caramel is not. I also heard no complaints about the black & white ice cream sandwich (dark chocolate cookies, white chocolate cheesecake ice cream, peppermint sabayon, pomegranate molasses), though it sounds like too much for me.   Soba has consistently delivered a solid menu and fine service over the years. Once on the cutting edge of Pittsburgh's nascent culinary scene, they're now part of the old vanguard, but there's nothing stale about the place. Adventurous vegetarians and omnivores will all find something to delight the palate, though I can't guarantee your 70 year old mom will fare as well.",

We gave it another try this week since we didn't feel like spending our Big Burrito birthday coupon anywhere else.. and my, it is an entirely different experience!  What we ordered this time: Chilean sea bass satays, Crispy calamari, Miso black cod and Roasted chicken ramen. The seafood orders were definitely the highlights. The glaze on the see bass satay brought out all the flavors and the fish was so fluffy! We didn't realize rice cakes accompanied the miso black cod entree even though it said so on the menu, and it was a really nice surprise. Nothing to take home about the roasted chicken ramen though: both the chicken and noodles were too tough.  What we ordered last time: Seared rare tuna (which was alright but bland) and Roasted duck (overcooked).  John served us this time and he had wonderful recommendations. Thank you for making our second visit so enjoyable! We are already planning on returning with guests in the future.",

    "text": "I've been here twice and am a huge fan. Asian fusion places are always tricky to master, but Soba has never failed to impress me. The main courses and desserts are delicious, beautiful, and have a nice spin on them without being too exotic or extreme. I can see both an Asian and Western flair in a variety of dishes, which is right up my ally. However, the two occasions I've been there, I find that the appetizers aren't as great as the main courses. The lobster tacos and the dumplings were bland and weren't seasoned well. I could definitely see having a bit more salt on the tacos and less of the mayo as a couple improvements, but the tacos were still delicious. The dumplings didn't have any taste and the dumpling itself was much too starchy than I was used to, but this is just a personal preference. Overall, I can definitely say that Soba has great main dishes and desserts and I'm hoping I can find that golden appetizer next time I come here.",

For the very first time the food was awful.  A scallion pancake replaced the kimchee pancake. The chef, who we learned was new, obviously had no idea that a pancake is the glue that holds a tasty morsel together. This was pure glue, tasteless and sticky. Where was the content, the taste, the flavor? The lump-crab egg roll was worthy of a corner take-out Chinese eatery, oily mostly. A pulled pork appetizer was passable, nowhere near the dish it replaced. find a new chef quickly. John E. Raffie.",

The atmosphere was elegant and the food was extremely well executed.   For an appetizer, I had the tempura fried rock shrimp drizzled in a spicy sauce. They were fried to perfection and the spice was tasty and not overwhelming. For my entree, I had the tuna tartare with taro root chips. The tuna was evidently fresh and well seasoned and the taro root chips added a nice textural element. My mother had pad Thai, which she says was excellent; pad Thai can so easily be mediocre. For dessert I sampled the condensed milk ice cream and one of their many varieties of tea, I believe it was something with lemongrass (in all honestly, I selected one at random because I was so sure any of them would be delicious, and I was right). If was a lovely finisher to a wonderful meal. I would definitely come here again.",

The venue is nicely done and offers an intimate vibe. I was seated at a table in the middle, not a booth. They had a screen on one side so that help to create a private feel. It's summer, so they had the garage window opened and that offered a good breeze.  Onto the food. I ordered the duck lo mein. When it came out, it was more duck than anything. The duck was cooked well and offered a slight crispiness. Nicely cooked. There was minimal noodles, but what was there was good. Two things did disappoint: 1) the dish was described as having mushroom, but there wasn't a noticeable amount and 2) the sauce was way too salty. Maybe it needed more noodles to balance itself out, but I found it too overwhelming flavor wise. It's a heavier dish than anticipated.  I was getting ready to pay when the waitress noticed it was my birthday, so she left me with a delightfully light chocolate mousse. Nice touch.",

Decor: Amazing decor! We sat at a high table in front of the falling water wall that gave an intimate setting for me and my couple friends to catch up on our adventures of the last three years from when I was in Atlanta. The dining spot is broken up so it feels like you have space to yourselves. 5 Stars.  Food/Quality to Price: 4.5 stars. We had the calamari to start, which was large but well it's fried food (so what is there to ride home about anyways), but I like the size that it came with. However, the sushi crab roll that I had, was fantastic. Truly, tons of crab in it and plenty to just eat yourself full of. My friends had the Thai Chicken curry, which was apparently great but unnecessarily huge (like everything in Pittsburgh); same with the Basil Chicken. You will definitely take half of everything home with you.  Drinks: Drinks were fine. Craft cocktails, but nothing crazy to ride home about. 3.5 stars for original recipes.  Service: Service was up to expectations. Nothing wrong with this, three starts. AOK.   All in all loved the experience and will come again and optimize my experience.",

We had a party of five, so we were able to sample a number of small plates, dim sum and noodles, including the prawn crackers, spicy pork lettuce wraps, the spring rolls, pork dumplings, Thai corn chowder and pad thai. There was a special menu when we were there, and we ordered from that, too. The standout from that menu were crab bao buns. There wasn't one disappointment in all of our plates. Cocktails were as good as any in the city.   Overall, this was a wonderful visit, and even with five adults, each with two cocktails, the check was not outrageous. Admittedly this was a special occasion, but we were pleasantly surprised to eat and drink so well for the price. My only disappointment was that I called in advance to say we were celebrating a birthday, and there was no mention - not even scoop of sorbet - for the birthday boy. I don't know if they are too cool for that, but it would have been a nice touch.",

The name \"Soba\" is very misleading to me - I expected more Japanese fare than there actually is on the menu. In fact there is NO SOBA at all on this menu which was a little surprising.  I will say there is great ambiance here for date night or a business dinner - beautiful decor, menus, and also comfortable seating. There's also a lounge and the cocktail menu looked excellent!  We ordered the calamari and soft shell crab bao bun (part of their temporary songkran menu) as starters. Both were a heavy, dense fry and were very filling. The calamari is big enough of a portion to share with a group. Overall, neither were the crispy texture we expected and kind of fell flat in terms of taste as well.  For the entree, we ordered the shaking beef, which did not live up to expectations. It's expensive for the portion size and not well executed. The hot mustard definitely threw me off.   Overall, was not impressed for the high price point of this restaurant and will not be back.",

For the Jirashi bowl the fish didnt taste particularly special and my friend thought the sea weed salad in the bowl was most delicious thing. It still had lots of sashimi in it. For the roll, it had an overpowering taste of shiso leaves. I didnt mind the taste but it definitely masked the flavor or the other ingredients. If you want to try some fusion / experimental asian food, i wouod give soba a try",

    "text": "I have been to almost all of the Big Burrito Group's restaurants, with the exception of Soba, Casbah and Umi.  I just knocked Soba off of that list since we just went there for my daughter Muff's birthday. (My child's birthday is actually December 31, New Year's Eve and getting reservations for more than a party of one on that date can be daunting.  Which is why I asked my child for a suggestion waaaayyy before her birthday and continually faced an answer of, \"I'm thinking about it\" to my chagrin.)  Anyway, we were able to pull off a reservation off f or an early evening meal for a party of six and our server, Missy was spectacularly accommodating and wonderful. (You must insist on getting her, if you can.  Enthusiastic, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and specials.  She is a diner's dream!  Having driven past Soba 8,000 times but never entering, I didn't know what to expect inside because the outside is a little nondescript.  Upon entry, we were really surprised by the decor; Peaceful, tranquil and calming with a Zen Buddhist touch.  We were really pleased with the decor and layout of the restaurant.  Now the food, we ate like it was a last supper.  We ordered a LOT off of the menu.  Here's what we had:  Crispy Calamari $12 Korean Fried Chicken $11 Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps $12 Chicken Spring Rolls $7 Pork Dumplings $10 Taiwanese Short Rib Pancakes $12 Thai Corn Chowder $9 Shaking Beef $32 Pad Thai $21 Ginger Fried Rice $5  With the exception of the Shaking Beef and Pad Thai, we ordered multiples of everything else so that everyone in our party of six could try what we ordered.  In fact, several people in our party liked their dim sum and appetizer dishes so much, they decided to order extras and make a meal out of them.  I honestly have to say that we fully enjoyed every single thing that we ate.  Our stand-outs were the Taiwanese Short Rib Pancakes, Crispy Calamari and Chicken Spring Rolls.  The Thai Corn Chowder was a considered by some a little too sweet, but I enjoyed it.  And the Chicken Spring rolls were actually filled with enough chicken so that it was recognizable as chicken. (I hate when things are so minced up in egg/spring rolls that you don't know what the heck that you're eating.)  Like I said, we really enjoyed our meal and service.  Is it a little pricey?  Yes!  I've had comparable meals in New York's Chinatown for less money, but the ambiance wasn't the same and neither was the service. (I shall leave nameless the last Asian restaurant that I ate at in New York where I felt like I was being punished for being a paying customer.)  Soba does well on all fronts and I would definitely go with a group and order everything.  And most importantly, my baby was really pleased with her birthday meal.",

The inside is decorated with a modern new age Asian feel and a little dimmer lighting. It was a very cool atmosphere inside.   I ended up ordering the autumn duck lo mein and my wife had the chicken spring rolls and a chopped salad. The duck was cooked nicely and included a breast and a leg. The lo mein was excellent! It had a nice kick to it with some cherries that added a balance of sweetness. I tried one of the spring rolls as well and it was also good and crispy (I'm not a huge spring roll fan).   The food here is excellent. However I found the portion size of the lo mein to be a little light compared to the amount of duck. Overall this place has really good Asian fusion choices and flavors on their menu. It is a tad bit on the pricey side for my tastes but still was a good experience.",

The bowl arrives hot and the food is still sizzling. The rice gets crispy and the gochujang adds nice spice. I ordered the chocolate Maki for dessert and it was both visually creative and delicious!

The restaurant space itself and ambience is awesome, there are a few different smaller dining areas rather than just one large room so it feels very different than other restaurants. They have a great drinks menu, I was surprised by how many drafts they had. My problem here, at least last night, was the service. Our waiter was very nice but we felt he neglected our table a bit. We ordered a few of the small plates rather than entrees. It took quite awhile, at least 20 minutes or so, to get our first small plate. We had the rock shrimp tempura, the Korean fried chicken and the steamed pork dumplings. Overall, everything was just okay which was a bit of letdown given how long we waited. Prices are somewhat reasonable. Maybe a better place for drinks rather than food.",

Started out with the crispy tofu which to be honest it wasn't as crispy as it used to be. Soba used to be the only place I'd even order it because I'd be disappointed elsewhere and I will say I was disappointed in it tonight. My main dish was the lobster and shrimp lo mein. It was the first night in the menu and our waiter sold it. I was NOT disappointed in this meal. It was filling and very generous amount of lobster and shrimp. As for the service it seemed like it could be better especially since there was not a large crowd in the lounge area.",

They have a small parking lot for Valet parking, otherwise you have to find a parking spot on the street, which can be challenging.   Once inside, the hostess offered to hang up our jackets. The atmosphere was unique, with a modern Asian twist and dim lighting. We were seated at a very small table for 2. My husband chose this restaurant, so I knew my options were limited based on what I like. None of the entrees stood out to me, and the one I would have tried, a chicken dish, they were out of for the evening. I ended up ordering the Chicken Spring Rolls and Chopped Salad. I actually enjoyed the spring rolls and the sweet and sour sauce that was served with it. However, the chopped salad was no greater than sub par. It came out as large pieces of iceburg lettuce and very small amounts of each ingredient on top listed on the menu. It was very small in size, but I am sure it is not meant to be an entree. I let my husband choose dessert, and he went with the Chocolate Maki. I like chocolate, but holy moly, was that chocolate! It was almost too rich and would have been better served with a glass of milk! I did love that it was presented as a play on sushi rolls.   Our waitress was fairly attentive. We asked her opinion on several menu items and she willingly shared her thoughts. Our water was refilled regularly by any server who passed by.   Overall, this was a fair experience. I am glad we tried it, but I would only go back if it were a special occasion or a group of friends wanted to go.",

We were there for dinner last night, had the Japanese Summer tasting menu.  The first two courses were amazing.  The ribeye in the third course was too undercooked, crossed the boundary from rare to raw, honestly tough to chew.  Our server saw that we weren't devouring it like the other courses, agreed that that the beef needed a bit more cooking.  The chef prepared new plates, perfect rare/ mid rare, and it was absolutely delicious.  Combining that all with the lovely dessert course, it was a terrific meal, and honestly a bargain at $45.  The point of this review is to complement the great standards that this restaurant holds themselves to.  The food is always very good, mostly great, sometimes shockingly innovative and delicious.  The service is always terrific, professional servers who give you everything that you need, and nothing that you don't.  Love it.  Still love it.",

I can never pass up the crispy tofu (which is also great at Mad Mex) -- it's the perfect balance of sweet and tart. For dinner, I realize the menu changes all the time, but if you ever come across it, I highly recommend the butternut squash soup as a starter. It's delicious! It's filling on its own (almost), but naturally I followed it with one of the noodle bowls with chicken, which was just spicy enough with flavorful chicken and vegetables.  The curry dishes are excellent, too. Soba service has always been friendly and attentive, and I love the dimly lit atmosphere and decor, particularly the waterfall wall. Meals are on the pricer side, but it's a nice night out, so it makes up for it (appetizers are around $12, meals are around $18-38 each).  They have excellent cocktails for happy hour, too, even if they are a bit on the pricey side ($10-13). Soba has great ambience for happy hour, too -- comfy seats and plenty of room for chatting. Whether you come here for a drink or a meal, it's always a pleasant experience.",

There was open bar as well as passed hors devours.  Then they had a buffet station for dinner and dessert.   Soba outdid itself.  We were about an hour late to the event, but they were still serving some hors devours.  I was able to sample a miso black cod bite in a Chinese soup spoon which was a delicious bite and perfectly cooked.  I also had a glass of Prosseco that my husband enjoyed as well.   Then the dinner service began, which included chili garlic mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, seared ahi tuna with korean bbq sauce, and filet mignon with a delicious sauce that I can't remember the name of.   The food was phenomenal.  The tuna and filet mignon were both stellar and cooked to rare perfection. I also enjoyed a Last Word cocktail with dinner which was perfectly balanced and delicious.   For dessert they brought out their chocolate pretzel stack which was delicious and so wonderful with a salty and sweet combination.  They also had what tasted like small lemon tart, but I can't find it on the menu.   Overall I can't wait to return!  The service, food, and atmosphere where all fantastic!",

Cocktails: nicely done, stiff but not too strong. Not memorable, but not disappointing.   Food: incredible!! Absolutely get the calamari; the mint cilantro combination feels like flavor bursts in your mouth. The Korean BBQ ribs were so tender and fell right off the bone. The tuna tartare is nothing special, but still pretty tasty. The lettuce pork appetizer dish was also incredible. They were also really accommodating of allergies, which is always appreciated.   Service: the hostesses were very polite, but the wait staff was really slow. I'm guessing they need more in the area.",

I came to Soba with two friends for the Oc Om Boc festival, and was pleased to order and eat the price-fixed ($35) four-course meal they offered. Delicious pho, egg rolls, spring rolls, duck confit, duck breast, noodles, beef and rice, fresh vegetables, and an incredible dessert of cake with a hint of banana (and a vanilla wafer).  The lights were turned low, there was a wall with running water streaming down from the top, and there was some contemporary playlist in the background playing all of your NPR favorites (David Gray, Radiohead). As an added bonus, the paper towels in the bathroom were EXCELLENT--I felt so guilty wiping my hands on them and throwing them away.  The menu is a bit pricey, but I don't think I'm experienced enough to judge its price vs. the food...I'm just a pretty broke college student who spends all of his expendable income on nice places like Soba.",

    "text": "Food ordered:  Drinks - Rhubarb Fizz, Flying Dog Porter Appetizers - Potstickers and Lettuce Wraps Entrees - Dolsot Bi Bim Bap and Vietnamese Beef Noodles  For $12, the Rhubarb FIzz was underwhelming, over-iced, overly bittered. Flying Dog Porter is a great beer. The Potstickers were ok, but tiny, while the Lettuce Wraps were the star of the entire dinner. Vietnamese Beef Noodles were bland and flavorless. The menu lists them as including jalapeno, but there was no heat whatsoever. As for the Bi Bim Bap, I've had this a few times at Korean restaurants, and it was very... different. They essentially took the appetizers and side dishes and tossed them in the pot. The kim chi and pickled shiitake just didn't belong in the dish, and brought a very off flavor to the entire things. It took a full dousing of the goju jang for the dish to be eatable. Very very disappointing.  Service was ok. They asked how the meal was too many times, yet after 15 minutes I had to flag down a waiter just for them to take my card so we could pay and leave.  It was my wife's birthday, and we took advantage of Big Burrito's GREAT free entree promotion, but even with $23 worth of Vietnamese Beef Noodles taken off the check, I still felt completely ripped off paying $80 for the rest of the meal and a tip. I'd much rather go to Noodlehead and pay $20 for a much better meal next time.",

I got a ramen dish last time that was amazingly spicy - in a good, sinus-clearing, make-you-think-about-what-you-just-done-boy sort of way.  The interior decor is quite beautiful and relaxing and swank. Presentation is quite nice too (well, soup can only get so pretty). I found the wait staff to be a little on the smug and unfriendly side, though. It isn't very clear how they separate the bar service from the seated tables, or where you're supposed to sit down, or how their whole system works. None of the staff seemed overly ambitious or excited to invite some new customers in.  I couldn't tell if they just are unhappy in their jobs or if they think they're top shit and should treat their clients like they don't belong, or what the deal was.  Perhaps it was just one experience. I'll be back to try it again - because the food is worth it.",

    "text": "I have dined at Soba more times than any other restaurant in Pittsburgh; it is my favorite! The dishes are original and creative, not like anything one can find elsewhere. I don't like tofu so much, but their tofu appetizer is fantastic - and is a large portion for a moderate cost. The chopped salad is worthy of my daily cravings. They usually have two vegetarian entrees, one or both of which can be made vegan. For a long while they had an awesome rice cake dish that I could not resist - it was a take on pesto with neato chewy rice cake noodle things and a seasonal mix of veggies and mushrooms. I do miss that one. But lately I've been getting the thakkali curry, which is pretty good too, with an interesting take on mango pickle (spicy!) and sadly, it comes with the best paratha in town.   Once I had a bad experience with the rice cake dish - it came out all wrong. I was unable to complain at the table due to my company...but I emailed the manager because I wanted them to know that somebody in the kitchen didn't seem to be gettin' it. I also took that opportunity of contact to ask for a recipe for some to-die-for brussels sprouts they used to have on their sides menu that were no longer available. The response was above and beyond what I could have expected. Everything was made up for and then some. And they apparently didn't have the recipe I requested on record, but gave me a general run down of how to make it from memory; now I make them at home according to Soba's instructions every time!  The drinks! Excellent. Some of my favorites are The Metamorphosis (no longer on menu, but I think you can still get it), Offer You Can't Refuse, The Dirty Pickle, La Pinta and Beauty Mark...They also have a nice selection of Sake, which is rare in Pittsburgh, however is is expensive to buy here.   The atmosphere is not really my style, but it passes as a cool calm romantic space. I do get sick of hearing the same music every time I go, but there are some great songs in the mix. The service is hit or miss, and some of the servers come off as scripted (probably new). Our last server was really slow about checking on us and drinks took a long time (though it wasn't busy). And as with most Big Burrito restaurants, I don't like that there are separate food runners from servers, because it makes it confusing and more time consuming to ask for things. I prefer the bar seating and service, usually.   All in all, I think Soba is Pittsburgh's best place to eat and drink.",

The first time was for a fancy-pants dinner in which the upstairs portion of the restaurant was reserved and the guests were privileged enough to indulge in unlimited drinks and a very elaborate 5 course meal.  Soba is very much \"Asian-Fusion\" in its cuisine, and it pulls it off quite well.  As a vegetarian, there are plenty of options for me to choose from.  Some of the dishes that stand out to me include the tofu appetizer and the vegetable curry entree.  The second time I visited here, I sat by the bar, which is dimly lit, relatively quiet, but gives off this cool sort of vibe.  I love it.  We had a great time.  Service was fantastic.   My critiques would be 1.) a tad bit pricier than what I would like to pay and 2.) could up the ante on the spice level just a tad.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this place.  I think you'll enjoy it.",

The food is pretty good, but paying $22 for ramen when I could go to Ramen Bar for half the price is just not very appealing. The pricing is comparable to Legume, but the food is far less unique. Also, the flavors were a bit bland, though I guess for a \"fusion\" place that is normal.   I will say that the ambience of this place is amazing. It is dim, but not too dark, and all of the furniture and decor is chosen with an eye for modern elegance. The bathrooms are beautiful and well-maintained (hey, bathrooms are important in a restaurant!).   All in all, a nice place to take a group of picky eaters who won't enjoy the less-traditional establishments. I would recommend it for business meetings.",

It's located in Shadyside, an area that I rarely venture out to for fear of destroying my car, but I will make the trek for Soba. And Mad Mex.  As others have noted, the restaurant is very intimate. Compared to Eleven, which is classy and upscale but rather casual (if that makes sense), Soba is definitely date night territory. In fact, my boyfriend took me on our first date to Soba followed by an awesome evening at Cirque de Soleil. What a night it was.  This restaurant is up to the standards of quality and service that all of Big Burrito's restaurants offer. The food is amazing, the drinks are tasty, and the staff are super friendly. The Asian Plum Sangria and the Bangkok Tea are my favorite drinks there, highly recommend them. The one called Offer You Can't Refuse - be careful. Tasty, but be careful.  As far as food, excepting one time we've always just ordered a round of different appetizers and spent the night sampling. I've never had anything I didn't like, and I in fact highly recommend the crispy tofu. Yum-my. Even if you think you don't like tofu, you feel so wrong about that stance once you've eaten theirs.  The only time we ordered entrees was on NYE. We engaged in their pre-fixe menu for the holiday. I can't remember what we had, but I do remember all of it being awesome. It was a really great way to spend NYE, avoiding any type of craziness and filling up on some good food.",

For appetizer, we had the kimchi pancakes, which were not fully cooked. They were doughy and sticky, and when we informed out waiter, he agreed with us that it was not fully cooked, but made no move to return the dish to the kitchen until we requested that it be at the very least warmed up to a degree in which it was actually edible.   I had the sea bass, which was mediocre and somehow different from the other wonderful times I had ordered this delightful dish - it lacked the explosively delicious flavors. The curry that was ordered was the worst - completely and wholly NOT recommended. The rice was tough (probably not fully cooked once again), and the spices were arbitrary to the chicken itself, as though they were thrown in after the chicken was already cooked.   Given the price of Soba dishes, the bill certainly took a plunge into our wallets, but sadly with no degree of satisfaction for our taste buds or stomachs.",

I ve had the vegetarian pad thai on a different occasion and that was pretty amazing too. They dont have too many vegetarian options i kind of wish they did.

We didn't want to drive in the snow so walked over to Soba on a Friday night and actually made reservations just an hour before (we prob won't get away with that on a non-stormy night). After a blast of warm air I was welcomed into this dark, cozy and seductive venue. We were led up to the top level and settled in. I ordered a Sapporo, calamari and tuna. Beer always hits the spot for me. Calamari was delicious with a nice mayo sauce with a squirt of lime. The tuna was tender! My butter knife cut into it so easily. The side of kimchi was just okay and the abundance of hot sauce sauce was to much for me. Fried rice went well with everything and balanced the tuna and sauce out. We then ordered the coconut cashew brownie which was delicious too as suggested by the waitress. The portions were large imho and while the service was fantastic I just thought the food was priced a tad high for what was offered. Seems like Soba would be nice for a special occasion or just to have a nice dinner though.",

The lighting sets the mood, and they have a TV which is good for when you want to keep an eye on the game but not be completely absorbed with it.

First off, it is WAY overpriced -- I should not have to pay $25 for a subpar dish of chewy pork with an \"asian\" sauce that was basically a ton of sugar and not much else. The salmon was OK but not worth the $25 either.  The only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that the waitstaff were very friendly and the appetizer was original and tasty (carrot/ginger soup). In fact, if I ever went back (which I won't) I would probably just order a few appetizers and go home happy and not broke.  I know good thai food, and good asian fusion food, and this place is just not it.",

Lucky for Soba I moved to solid foods after two of those on an empty stomach.    I slurred my dinner order of the pork belly, crispy tofu, lobster maki rolls, and Thai corn chowder-all fantastic. The pork belly was topped with brown sugar crumble and cooked with honey. It was amazing.  For dessert I had the pumpkin ice cream sandwiches.  I washed all of that down with two Ketel One and sodas and stumbled out of the restaurant fat and happy.    Sadly, our car was broken into in the parking lot and my friend's laptop was stolen and his window broken.  I told the bartender just in case the employees park there as well.  He was genuinely sympathetic but not entirely surprised.  Based on what the police officer said, it was the second one tonight.  She also said there is at least one of these a day in that lot or around the restaurant on the street. I think Soba may need to invest in a part time parking lot attendant to protect their customers.",

I had fairly high expectations and I can honestly say that they were all met! On Open Table I requested a quiet table and the request was honored, which is always a huge plus. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly, even when I asked to exchange my cocktail since I thought the one I ordered was a  bit sour. Fortunately the second cocktail made with honey and gin was amazing!  For an appetizer we shared the hamachi sashimi and it was perfectly delicious. For our entree we shared the ahi tuna and it was very fresh and well-seasoned. The Korean barbecue sauce served over the tuna was on the spicy side, but not too much so, the ginger fried rice and kim chi served alongside were also very good. For our dessert we shared the chocolate maki and wow, it was amazing! This is definitely a must if you visit this restaurant! It's incredibly decadent and certainly large enough to share. Taste aside, the presentation makes it worth trying: in place of ginger they serve freshly grated melon and what looks just like wasabi is actually whipped pistachio cream.   I'd definitely visit this restaurant again!",

I also had the chopped salad which I suprisingly really enjoyed despite it being iceburgh lettuce which is definitely not what I use for a good salad. I wish they didn't put fried batter all over it though.   Last I had the vegetarian curry dish, the only vegetarian main I found. It was boring and not enough curry gravy with plain white rice! No delicious fragrant jasmine rice....Also deep fried the Naan, didn't enjoy that. The potatoes were also undercooked with not much flavor in the dish overall.   We were put at a table in the very corner of the third floor and all I had to stare at was a wall and an ugly floating tv hutch. It was very cold.  We were the first people in the restaurant but took FOREVER to get served. Everything took a long time to come out and the service was very poor.   Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I heard umi is also one of their restaurants and I loved it so I thought this one may have been just as good. It was not enjoyable.   Also the valet took FOREVER though it's a tiny parking lot right outside the front door and the booth was freezing despite a heater hanging way too high and no door. Heat rises....I thought most people knew this.",

It's at least 15 yrs old bc I had my 21st birthday dinner there.    I recommend you make reservations before dining here, and you can do it electronically through their website, its really easy.  Before your dinner I urge you to have cocktails in their bar.  Its a lovely space, in fact I've come here just for cocktails.  The restaurant itself has a really cool vibe to it.  Asian fusion meets dark wood?  I dont know how to explain it, but its a beautiful restaurant perfect for a romantic dinner, dinner w/ girlfriends, or even a business meeting.  I like to sit out on the covered patio.  In fact the last time I was there, it poured rain and it was actually kind of romantic and cool to hear the rain.    But anyway the food...the food...  You're not going to leave stuffed but you will leave happy.  I love thier crispy tofu appetizer and miss it when I haven't had it in awhile the way some people miss their ex's.  I usually order the pad thai when here, it is delicious and balanced and not too salty.  If they have scallops on the menu, get those.  They're fantastic.  I dont like chocolate, ever, at all--but their chocolate maki dessert is to die for.  Soba is not cheap, but I do think it's completely reasonable.  They've got a great wine list and the service is always great.",

    "text": "Really solid food, and excellent service thanks to Bart, our extremely genial waiter. I've been to Soba twice before for entrees (thank you, Birthday Club!) and been satisfied, but tonight's sharing plates + maki dinner had me downright impressed. The shishito peppers are delicious, and a nice foil to richer, porkier dishes. The Chilean Sea Bass skewers were very nicely flavored, though we were disappointed to not be served the skin--it's the tastiest part! We also got the Korean fried chicken bao (Vietnamese style slider), and while the chicken was very authentic in its sticky sweet glaze and crispy coating, we felt the buns were missing some spice and acid...a little gochujang would have made them much more balanced.  We also ordered both the double maki rolls, and they were tasty although the tuna roll didn't seem to have much of the spicy mayo. We were also tempted into dessert...I usually take one look at the menu and think \"I could make that, and that, and that...\" but Soba's dessert menu is quite thoughtful and creative. We got the banana split and the pretzel stack, and while both were quite tasty (the miso caramel was especially interesting), neither was particularly remarkable (the raspberry ice cream of the night clashed with the banana and caramel, and the stack needed a bit more crunch to cream). If you're into desserts, I would highly recommend saving room at least for a peak, because it's rare to find a restaurant that puts such effort into the post-dinner menu.  I would be remiss if I didn't give a fuller commendation to Bart, who jovially kept our water glasses filled, offered recommendations, and ensured that everything was prepared to our liking (even going so far as to sub out the coffee-flavored ice cream on the split). He struck the magic balance of being there every time we looked for him but nowhere in sight when he was not needed. Soba is lucky to have him.",

I went there for my birthday dinner this year and they were extremely accommodating of my vegan needs (the crispy tofu is one of my favorite dishes in Pittsburgh), and for such a high-end restaurant their portions are great and satisfying. The ambiance, the decor, and the cocktails are beautiful and unique. Our server Albert was amazing! So attentive and fun, he really made my dining experience feel unique and special. Highly recommend.",

It was always a 5 star experience....but in the last few months somethings different and thus the 3-star status. I'm not sure what it is...whether it's taking exceptionally long to get attention for service (here's a hint...if you get everyone drinks faster, they're probably more likely to have a better experience!), or the quality of food, or not feeling like you got the best value for the price paid when you walk out.... I haven't given up on it here yet - and have high hopes that it's just a bump in the road.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places to eat for a special occasion.   I'll break down the atmosphere, service, and food below!   Atmosphere is very intimate with low lighting to set the mood. Tables for 2 are a little close to each other but this seems to be the new trend in restaurants. Sometimes it is hard to not pay attention to neighboring table conversations or glance at what they are eating. Very clean however and the decor gives you a modern asian feel.  Service was awesome. Albert was our server for the evening and helped us with all of our questions. He was extremely versed on all menu items and their descriptions. Our food arrived in steady sync and other staff members came by to constantly fill our waters and clear empty plates.  Now for the good part, the FOOD! They were offering a 4 course tasting menu which we opted to pass on. To start we ordered the Corn and Crab bisque. Excellent semi smoky flavor with plenty of jumbo lump crab and corn to accompany the smooth texture of the soup. We then got the rock shrimp tempura and lobster tacos. The shrimp came out with perfect temperature and crispiness tossed in a spicy dressing. Very similar to the shrimp served at The Bonefish Grill. The Lobster tacos had a nice fresh taste with the crunch of the shell. The avocado cream was seasoned just right and the zest of the lime was delightful. For our main entrees my girlfriend and I both got the Filet with fried brussel sprouts. Filets were cooked perfectly to our liking and the crisp on the sprouts were delicious. Dessert consisted of the Chocolate Maki that I took a picture of an Creme Brulee. Both exceptional.   Overall, a great experience from start to finish from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. Valet is also nice as it is complimentary and tip is not required, but always good to do so, especially with the weather being so cold!",

First plate was steamed dumplings with squash.  The steamed dumpling was the consistency of a leather shoe.  The filling was barely apparent.    I shade a piece of the friend pork dumpling...which was better.  I also shared the fried tofu which was good.  Second course was salmon roll.   I asked for it third but it was placed at the same time with the incorrect third course.   It was delicious.   When the error was corrected, my third course was the Sichuan chicken which was so salty it was inedible.  My friendly server let me know that the manager tasted it and agreed....bizarre.   Nobody chose dessert.   I will probably not go back.   I can get good rolls in the strip for less.    The waiter was the only redeeming factor.",

They always have a few great beers on tap too if that's your thing. You can get sushi, which I presume comes from Umi upstairs.  I'd give it 5 stars, but I think the Soba restaurant itself lacks ambiance. It's kind of weirdly quiet and too loud at the same time. If you go as a couple, you inevitably get a table uncomfortably close to large loud tables on either side. Feels like they're cramming you in like the one \"nice\" restaurant in a college town on Valentine's day. Last time after we saw where we were seated, we just went to the bar, which was a lot nicer and serves the same food.  Overall, Soba is a great place. Good food and drink. Just sit in the bar area.",

    "text": "Definitely one of the better and more upscale modern Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh (excluding Thai food- so many good options). This was my first time at Soba after spending many visits at Umi. I would argue that Umi is the better sibling with excellent sushi options (with a hefty price tag) but Soba is a bit more approachable to the person who is less familiar with or doesn't want sushi. In all, it's a good place for a date with a desire for reasonable and modern Asian fusion.   Ambience: Trendy, dimly lit and very clean decor. It suits the cuisine and is well set for small groups or a date. Not too loud but certainly not dead either. I loved the bar area- has a mix of bar and casual couch/lovechair seating that's well suited for a date or small group. Based on the clientele and set up, I'd lean towards trendy attire if you come here- not a casual place by any means.   Food: Thai corn chowder- so good and very rich. I would return just for that dish. For an entree, I had the seared rare tuna. They definitely didn't skimp on my portion of tuna and cooked it well. Granted tuna is a bit bland, I was hoping for more seasoning and oomph from the Korean barbecue sauce. The ginger fried rice made up for any disappointment I had with the tuna. For dessert, the chocolate pretzel stack was fantastic- perfect mix of chocolate, sweet caramel and the salty wonton chip.   Drinks: The old fashioned was well-executed. Went back for a second. Can't speak for any of their other cocktails.",

Again the waitress brought half our order and we waited (it was noticeable and shouldn't have been...kinda like your heart beating, if you notice it, somethings wrong) for the other half which never came.  We actually left without even having it wrapped but having paid for it.  Frustrated at the sssslllooooowwwwwww service and lack of attention.

But my husband and I have continued coming here over the years for special occasions, because it's so good!  The fried tofu appetizer is incredible. I'm a vegetarian, but my husband is not and usually doesn't like tofu - even he gets excited for the fried tofu.  We have both tried various menu items and drinks here, and everything has been top-notch. The atmosphere inside is beautiful, and if it's nice outside, it's nice to sit on the covered patio. We always look forward to an occasion to come back here and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a romantic or just delicious evening!",

    "text": "After hearing so  much about Soba over the years, I knew it had to be my February destination for my New Year's Resolution: one Pittsburgh restaurant each month that I've never been to!   My 3 girlfriends and I made a reservation for shortly after they opened for the evening, so the space was nice and quiet for the majority of our dining experience.  I ordered a glass of chardonnay ($10) to start, and the four of us decided to split the crispy tofu appetizer ($10).  The appetizer portion was perfect for the four of us to snack on and could easily be made into your meal or hearty shareable plate for two.  For my main course, I ordered a bowl of the Thai corn chowder ($8) and the double tuna fat roll ($14).  There were so many delicious entrees to choose from, but I had to remind myself that my eyes are always bigger than my stomach, and settled on the soup and roll - I will definitely be back again to try one of their entrees:  the Long Island duck & seared rare tuna dishes sounded phenomenal.  Our first round of dishes was served shortly after we finished the crispy tofu:  my Thai corn chowder was excellent - perfect consistency, temperature and flavor.  One complaint is that the menu description for the chowder touts jumbo lump crab meat and I had one measly piece, which was rather disappointing.  The other girls in my party had a couple orders of steamed dumplings, which looked good and again were large enough of a portion to make into a meal.  Our waiter was extremely attentive, checking on us regularly and making sure our water glasses remained filled.  This is such a subtle task, but for as much water as I gulp down at each meal I greatly appreciate when waiters and waitresses keep my glass full.  It was a bit of a wait for our maki rolls which surprised me a bit, seeing as (I would assume) they take less time to prepare than other entree-style dishes.  About 15 minutes after our first course was cleared, our rolls were served.  I'm not sure if there was an error in submitting our order to the kitchen, but both courses that were brought out were served to the wrong person at our table. Perhaps the breakdown came when a different waiter served our food than the waiter that took our order. Obviously the fix is as easy as exchanging a couple of plates across the table, but it's something that could most definitely be avoided.  Regardless of the musical plates that we played, the rolls were delicious and I soon hit a sushi wall... they say you're never to leave a soldier behind, but I had to leave one lone, tasty piece of the double tuna fat roll on the plate by itself.   I had just enough to eat at that point and was mentally high-fiving myself for not ordering an entire entree, half of which would've likely ended up in a doggy bag.  Overall, I am pleased with my experience at Soba and will most definitely be back.  The interior is intimate and dimly lit so it would be a perfect date night spot or, as I did, a girls night out.  There really doesn't seem to be a bad item on the menu. On this particular visit, they were even offering a special prix fixe menu in celebration of the Chinese New Year.  It looked tempting but again, my eyes are always bigger than my stomach and I had to politely decline the opportunity.",

The interior (which I hear was renovated) was just that - NYC style trendy and the ambience was romantic. I had requested a seat overlooking the waterfall when I made the reservation which they said they could accommodate on the mezzanine but when we got there, they said it was closed. So we sat in the side room - not a huge deal.  We had the Korean BBQ appetizer, which was DELICIOUS! It felt kind of funny eating with my hands whilst in such a nice restaurant wearing a pretty dress, but I would totally get these again. *mouth waters*  For entrees I got the chicken ramen soup bowl which had a lot of chicken in it (pleasant surprise!) and was nice and hot. I added a little of the hot chutneys to it :) BF got the bim bam bop which he said was so-so. He asked for the egg on the side, but they plopped it in the middle. I'll have to say the service was so-so.  Nice for a special occasion and with 2 $10 off entree holiday coupons it didn't break the bank.",

If you have a reservation for 5pm, they do not open their doors until 5pm so be prepared to wait outside beforehand. The entrees weren't as good as the appetizers as most of the appetizers were really deliciously exceptional. The edamame hummus was wonderful. It was served with taro chips which were excellent but they don't give you enough chips for the amount of hummus they give you and you will be charged $2 if you ask for more chips, which I think is a bit much, especially when you order as much as we did (over $200). My sister didn't like the $26 hanger steak which she said was chewy and sent it back. They took the steak off the bill but didn't comp her for the $19 meal she ordered instead. It was an inconvenience that she had to order another meal and the least they could do was comp it. They didn't do anything special for my birthday so be aware of this if you are celebrating something nice. There are many other establishments I've been to that give you dessert, sing to you or throw you something special to celebrate your day, this is not the place for that. My boyfriend ordered the duck ramen $22 and it wasn't good at all..AT ALL, would not recommend it! He ate most of it but the taste was off as the duck didn't compliment the ramen noodles or the seasonings they added to it, which all sat in a non appetizing soupy broth. The corn chowder $9 with crab was just ok... crab in a creamy corn sauce, not the most appetizing of combinations. The chirashi bowl $16 was good, a big bowl of sushi parts. There was a raw quail egg in it which made the dish a bit runny but the fish and rice was good and I really liked the seaweed strips added to it, though I wouldn't get it again. I would prefer a sushi roll as compared to rice with raw fish thrown atop of it. The spicy tuna maki roll $14 was good, definitely a cut above regular sushi. My mom and sister got vegetarian and chicken/shrimp pad thai $17/$21 which was a big serving and they enjoyed. I tried the noodles, they were good, not great. The steamed squash dumplings $10 were OUT OF THIS WORLD! Definitely would order those again. For my main dish, I ordered a salad $11 and sea bass satay, both extraordinarily great!  I'm glad I ordered 2 small plates compared to an entree which isn't their strong suit. The szechuan chicken appetizer $10 no one was crazy about. It was fried, a lot of curry, and dry peppers and green onions. It didn't taste like chicken at all and had the consistency of dog treats. My dad got the vegetarian bi bim bap $21 and really enjoyed it. Overall, the service was good and small plates were delicious but the entrees fell short. I would come back but for small plates only.",

    "text": "Had I went with more people, I would have loved to have ordered more small plates to share. However, I ventured to Shadyside alone. As an appetizer, I ordered the kim chi pancake. The sauce is what makes the dish. Without the tangy soy sauce, the kim chi, which has bay scallops and shrimp, the pancake tasted lackluster. Definitely to be combined with kim chi and the bean sprouts sides as well.   As my main entree I ordered the miso cod. FABULOUS. By far the best cod I've ever had. The flavors were so rich and surprising with every bite. Atop the cod was a zesty lemony topping, while the miso sauce was unbelievable with a spicy kick. The cod was perfectly tender and just melted in the mouth. While the BBQ pork was less tender, I appreciated that it was lean meat. Along with the pine nuts and the rice cake medallions, each bite was a sensory eruption. Sizeable portion.  For dessert I ordererd the banana split with bruleed banana, banana cake, chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce, lychee sorbet (substitute for sesame, on the side), and condensed milk. Super decadent, but terrfic.   Service was impeccable. Cool atmosphere in an up-and-coming neighborhood. Definitely an interesting Pan-Asian repertoire.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to come here since I first moved to Pittsburgh, but I never gotten a chance. Until I went to Yelp's event and Soba was serving kabobs, ooh I then told myself I am coming here for my birthday. I joined the big burrito membership so I can receive a free meal for my birthday, but I never did :-( Anyway, I still went to Soba for dinner. I had their Long Island duck, boy it was delicious. My favorite meat is duck, so I have have a lot of ducks. Soba's duck is more like a four stars for me. However, my experience makes me give them a five stars. We had a party of three and we waited a very looooong time for our entree to come out. Everyone else had their food but us. So the manager came out and apologized for any inconvenience, and he asked us if we need anything. I jokingly said free wine, and he really did bring me a glass of wine. My sister then told him that it is my birthday but I never received the free meal, if I can have dessert for free. He really let me pick a dessert for free. I got the dark chocolate Maki, it was soooo good :-) This shows that they really care about customer satisfication. I will definitely come back for some special occasion.",

    "text": "Soba, Pittsburgh     I'm a fan of the Big Burrito Group- they're successful for 2 simple reasons: they have good food, and provide stellar service.     Saturday evening a group of us braved the 32-degree spring weather, and had dinner at Soba in Shadyside.     The decor at Soba was minimal, but tasteful. Small polished stones were placed in front of each place setting, complimenting the wooden--faced menus. Our host was running a few minutes late, so I did some exploring. To the right, just beyond the hostess stand was a single, elongated, VIP table. Above the seating area was a large, organic wall with cascading water- if you've ever seen those really cool Zen-like mini pug-in H20 displays at Bed Bath and Beyond, it's like one of those- on a grand scale.  The bar/lounge area located at the far end of the restaurant was filling up with hip, well-dressed patrons eager to socialize and sip trendy cocktails. The lighting was dim and warm throughout; most of the diners were using the flashlights on their cell-phones to peruse to decipher the menu. Comfortable couches were scattered about making for a fun, informal meeting spot.     As I sat at our table waiting for everyone to arrive, I asked our server what he recommended.     \"Black cod for sure,\" he said.     Now that I had decided on my entree, it was time to review the starters.     The Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps looked good (12), as did the Edamame (9), Jumbo Lump Crab Spring Rolls (13), Rock Shrimp Tempura (12), and Lobster Roll (15). We ended up sampling ALL of these plates, as well as the sweet corn and crab chowder.     The Spring Rolls were impeccably fresh, and the crab sweet and succulent. My favorite appetizer however, was the Rock Shrimp Tempura prepared with spicy aioli, tsumi, ponzu, and chives.  Another fantastic dish was the Sweet Corn and Crab Chowder that included curry, and FULL FAT coconut milk.  Between courses we opted for the Soba Chopped salad- a perfect combination of taste and texture with fresh papaya, mango, daikon, creamy avocado, iceberg lettuce, mint, basil, cashews, and coconut tempura- a spicy tempura dressing completed the dish.  With our palates adequately cleansed, we chose our main courses. Miso Black Cod (30) for me please- also ordered: Tandoori Scottish Salmon (27), Seared Rare Tuna with Sesame Crust (30), and Filet Mignon (38).     The fish was served in a medium-sized ceramic bowl, and included barbequed pork, rice cakes, bok choy, ssam jang, and pine nuts. The cod was buttery and rich- the barbecued pork was delicate, yet flavorful. A tangy miso broth puddled at the bottom of the bowl, and was quickly lapped up with my soupspoon.     I had the opportunity to try the Seared Tuna, and Scottish Salmon- both delicious.     \"You have to order the Frozen Cashew Terrine,\" our host suggested.     I didn't want to upset him of course, so we ordered two for the table, along with some basil-lemon sorbet, and the Soba Banana Split.     The terrine was amazing- I had never had anything like it. The dessert had the texture of ice cream, but was more dense, and packed with flavor. Also on the plate was chocolate ganache, mango, raspberry coulis, candied pecans, and real whipped cream- I would go back just to eat this.     Soba serves amazing food- couple that with a great atmosphere, and flawless service, and you have a True winner.",

    "text": "First, it's a beautiful space. It's the kind of place that would be good for a nicer date. It's also the kind of place where they offered to take our coats at the door.  I tried two cocktails. The Hattori Hanzo was pretty good. I like cocktails that are sweet, but where you can still taste the alcohol. I also had the Asian Plum Sangria, which tasted like juice, so if you don't like to get that hint of alcohol in your cocktail, that'd be my recommendation. Sips of my friends' Cucumber Collins and Thai Mule proved that they can make decent cocktails at Soba. I was expecting something a little more creative tasting at a place like Soba, but I guess I can't complain about what they did have.   Food-wise, we ordered the shiitake dumplings and bao buns as appetizers. The dumplings were a bit doughy. However, the bao buns with fried chicken (instead of the typical pork belly) were delicious! I wanted more. I got the Seared Rare Tuna. It came with rice, kimchi, cucumbers and onions, and a BBQ peanut sauce. I'm glad they put the sauce on the side because it was a bit overpowering. The tuna was one large chunk. I think they should have served it as two pieces and drizzled the sauce on top, but overall, it tasted nice and it was filling. I tried my friend's Miso Black Cod and it was scrumptious, like melt in your mouth delicious. The Long Island Duck was also pretty good. For dessert we shared (as you can tell, we love sharing) the Tahitian Vanilla Creme Brulee and the Frozen Cashew Terrine. Both were really great.   One thing I'd suggest would be for them to be informed as to where the fish is sourced from. I wanted to know where the tuna was from, but our server didn't know. Overall though, the service was good.",

    "text": "The menu here is very pricey, and some things are complete hits, and others are total misses, thus I give it a 3.5-star rating. We started with the crab and corn chowder (creamy, spicy and delicious - $8), chilean sea bass satay (large cubes of cod, cooked rare, tender, with a sweet, tasty sauce - $12). I had the shiitake dumplings ($9 - 5 or 6 in an order, fried, pretty good but nothing stupendous). We got the double salmon roll, which had a lot of mayonnaise on it for my taste, especially since this was not listed as an ingredient on the menu. I probably wouldn't have ordered it if I'd known. The fish was delicious ($14). We also got the hamachi sashimi, a favorite of my dinner partner's. He said the fish was great, but the fennel, apple and avocado sauce added to the dish were a total miss and detracted from the great fish underneath ($14). We both wished the hamachi had been combined with flavors that made more sense for its delicate flavors. Finally, we shared the red curry and rice, which neither of us particularly cared for. It is an all vegetable dish, with tofu, broccolini, butternut squash, and a fried egg I never found in the dish ($17). We opted to skip the entrees, which run from $22-34, and we were glad we did, as this amount of food more than filled us up, with enough for at least one meal of leftovers, despite coming very hungry. We finished our meal with the cashew terrine ($9), which was essentially a trio of pureed cashew and coconut milk bars served with chocolate sauce, candied cashews, and raspberry/passionfruit sauce. Finally, we had the port trio, all of which were wonderful and a relatively good deal ($14 for 3 small glasses).  At a previous event, we also tried soba's food, and got the chance to taste the crispy tofu (bland, but inoffensive, $9), roasted chicken ramen (delicious, $22, enough for leftovers), and pad thai (good, but way overpriced with too many noodles and costing $19, for something I could get at my neighborhood thai joint for $12-14).",

When you feel as though you're going to an upscale restaurant you should know that they can at least cook the food properly, and while they did take the dumplings off the bill, the entire meal should have been comped.

The portions were tiny, but since the flavor wasn't exceptional I thought the price was a bit high. I've eaten at Michelin star restaurants before and am used to high prices for small portions, but if you're going to give small portions I expect the food to give me \"wows and mouth-opening reactions of flavor.\" Expect Soba's food to be good, but not memorable.   The best part of the meal was the dessert. Their yuzu tart is excellent - perfect balance of tartness, sweetness, and crunch.   I would come back to try their regular menu, and I would recommend this place for a nice dinner. The actual restaurant has an spacious, but maze-like layout which I appreciated.",

    "text": "Soba got a lot really nice reviews so my wife and I decided to try it out while visiting pittsburgh.  The atmosphere and ambience are cool and really nice.  While the portion sizes are large and food is beautifully plated, the dishes really just average. The ingredients and flavors of two dishes we are needed balancing very badly.  If you're sensitive to spicy food beware because every dish was spicy and geared for bold flavor.  We had the Burmese Salad, Miso Black Cod and the Cantonese noodles with beef.  The salad was very creative and with a little tender care and adjustment to the ingredients it could be a really nice dish (too many spices added and too little dressing/vinegarette). The Miso Black Cod filet was the highlight of the dish (prefectly cooked, beautiful taste) but unfortunately it was massively overpowered by the super strong gochujong sauce that drenched the rest of the dish. While the piece of fish was really nice, the rest of the dish was too extreme and lacked the finesse of a decent arrangement.  The Cantonese noodles were pretty good and our favorite out the three dishes.  The beef was nicely marinated and cooked perfectly to give a nice tenderness.  The noodles seemed they provably came from a package and were a bit too thin (unlike traditional beef ho fun) so nothing special there.    While the service was great and the dishes were presented beautifully, the ingredient combinations did not mesh well enough for good fusion with balanced flavors and the prices were too high.",

The grilled salmon was cooked perfectly with a wonderful coconut Thai sauce.

Found plenty of free street parking on a Sunday eve....check. Plenty of seating available for a 6pm reservation....check.  Didn't know they had a patio!  Beautiful upstairs setting for a warm summer evening.  It appears they also have a gas heater on the patio for chilling nights of dining as well.    I started with a chopped salad.....very San Francisco....mango, cucumber, papaya, mint, avocado, cashews and a miso dressing.    The waitress brought over, \"complements of the kitchen\", a yellow/orange saucy cucumber sampling with pita squares.  Not bad for just a taste.    I ordered the Alaskan Halibut which was amazing.  Not the absolute best I've ever had, but it was pretty high up there on the list....especially in a city where fried foods are the norm.  And there was plenty on my plate to fill me up...no room for dessert.  I would definitely return, especially if entertaining out-of-towners.",

Three of us went through four small plates slowly, and with the apt guidance of our patient and chipper waiter. It was nice not to be rushed, even though we intended to graze through the meal. The tuna tartare was conventional, but tasty, and the lobster maki's lobster was hard to taste or even find. However, the short rib buns--wow. Short ribs are everywhere lately--thanks, Top Chef--but I'd eat these every day, as their richness and warmth was balanced brightly by pickled cucumber and cilantro. We washed these plates down with cocktails: I'd highly recommend mine, which had amaretto, sake, and coconut milk and tasted like a cool, smooth cookie. We then split two desserts with dessert wine and sherry to match. The chocolate maki had us licking our fingers.  I'm not totally sold on the originality of the menu, but it sure tasted good. Next up: Casbah!",

For this price, I would expect excellent food and great atmosphere which this place has failed to deliver.",

I've had it twice here, and each time, a loser.  This time it had a great taste, but the after taste had too much of a carbon flavor for my palate.  However, the mussels were great and the braised ribs were excellent.  Nonetheless, I still have that burnt carbon taste in my mouth, hence the 3 stars.  Would I go back again?  Yes.  But just stay away from the pad thai.",

    "text": "My family and I dined at Soba Lounge for my graduation dinner. While the ambiance and service were great and some of the dishes were delicious, many of the dishes were way too salty.  We decided to share the lobster maki and the sea scallops.  Both were good and the sea scallops were cooked perfectly.  My mom chose to get the grilled baby octopus and the chopped salad.  The baby octopus was very tender, but was a bit too salty.  The chopped salad was probably one of the best dishes I tried that night because it was so light and refreshing whereas everything else was on the saltier side. I got the seared rare tuna.  The tuna portion was sizable and I loved the crunchy texture of the crust with the melt-in-your-mouth rare interior. However I thought it could have done without the korean bbq sauce. I felt like there were too many flavors that were competing with the dish when all I wanted to do was taste the tuna. The cucumber and red onion salad was delicious but I did not like the kimchi at all.  Maybe it's because I'm Korean and more picky with kimchi but it was just too sour, which may be perfect for stews but is not really enjoyable for eating.  The ginger fried rice that came with my meal was a complete joke. It was so salty I could not take more than 3 bites of it and there was zero ginger flavor because all you could taste was the salt. My younger sister ordered the miso black cod, which she enjoyed although she said that it was a little over seasoned.  I got a bite of it and it was flaky and good. My older sister had the striped bass that she liked as well. My dad, however, got the pork and shrimp fried rice and was really unhappy with it.  The portion was massive but it didn't need to be because he barely made a dent in it.  Like my ginger fried rice, the pork and shrimp was way too salty.  Our waitress was really nice but I other than checking up on the food during the appetizers, she didn't ask about our entrees. I don't think my dad felt like making a fuss about it but when she asked if he wanted his meal to go because it was basically untouched, she didn't ask if there was anything wrong with it when he said no thanks.   For dessert, my older sister got the coconut macaroon tart, which she devoured.  I chose the frozen cashew terrine, which was also really good.  The raspberry coulis way overpowered the mango, but other than that, the dessert was good.   Overall, while there were good parts of the meal, I think you can't really overlook the general saltiness of many of the dishes.  I'm curious to see if it was just a fluke night and might want to go back since the restaurant was recommended by  many of my friends but there are so many other good restaurants in Pittsburgh that I don't know if I will choose to dine there again any time soon.",

It is next door to Umi (Big Burrito's sushi place) in a trendier area of Shadyside.  The space is elegant--a waterfall adorns the interior.  Lighting is dark as is the decor--as with most Big Burrito establishments.  There is plenty of space between tables and such--you can take a date here and you should.  The food is excellent.  Dishes are inventive (not your normal Asian fusion dishes here) and well presented.  The quality of the ingredients is top-notch (my tuna tar tare tasted very fresh).  As a note, tasting menus are not available--two specials seemed to offered every night.  The menu seems to change by season as well.  Soba's wine and whiskey selection is extensive--10 pages for wine, 4 for whiskey.  The service is excellent, as is to be expected.  Really, everything here is great.  You should go at least once, Soba is a gem in the rough of the Pittsburgh dining scene.",

Our waiter was knowledgeable and offered helpful suggestions to enhance our meal. We started with the Lobster Maki. Then we had the Thai corn chowder with crab. For main course we I had the seared rare tuna and my wife had salmon. The tuna was perfect! And for dessert we had espresso creme' brulee. I had to think really hard to come up with any negative about our experience. We had just a wonderful time. If I was pressed to offer any criticism, it would be that our meal seemed a bit rushed. We have not stopped talking about our time out! Overall 5/5",

    "text": "Overrated.  Completely overrated.  After reading all the rave reviews and hearing about how amazing SOBA was, I went there last night with two companions.  We started off with an order of calamari and tuna tartar.  What came out even before our appetizers was a complementary cucumber salad (it appeared that every table got it).  I found the flavor of the cucumber salad the best part of dinner.  The cool cucumbers were complemented with a slightly spicy sauce, which were served with slices of pita bread.  Even though our waiter went on about how the calamari was different than other restaurants, it was strikingly similar to the overly breaded calamari at the Cheesecake Factory.  It wasn't heavily seasoned, and most of the flavor came from the garlic sauce and freshly squeezed lime juice.  I preferred the tuna tartar over the calamari, as the the flavors melded well together with just the right amount of bite from citrus notes.  These were served with house made potato chips, which were sliced thin and fried golden with just the right amount of crunch.  For entrees, my companions ordered our server's #1 and #2 recommendations of seared rare tuna and boneless pork chop, and I ordered the wok seared sea scallops, since I've been having a craving for large plump sea scallops for some time.  One companion asked a rhetorical question of why everything that is labeled as \"Asian fusion\" or \"exotic\" has to be spicy, which we could not answer.  His seared rare tuna was a tuna steak cooked rare topped with the Korean \"gochujang\" mellowed out with some soy and probably sugar (that's where the fusion plays in, instead of kiwi or pear juice).  He mentioned that he liked the ginger fried rice, even though the rice was probably one day old (fried rice is traditionally made with leftover rice).  My other companion received a 10 oz. thick cut pork chop.  Being so thick and also pork, the meat was flavorless and dry.  I sampled a piece from the outside edge and one cut from the center; the first piece had the flavor form the char, but the center cut one was so bland I could not finish it.  The defining part of the dish was it's spicy chili honey sauce, as it made the pork edible.  The grits were OK, not amazing, but not bad.  Two five oz. pork chops would've probably done the dish more justice than that 10 oz monstrosity.  Meats that need to be cooked through should not be thick cut unless it's well marbled, and we all know how hard it is to find marbled pork nowadays.  Last, my dish consisted of around 4 oz. of rice cakes cooked in an overly salty \"sauce\" with pork and bok choy topped with four seared sea scallops.  For some reason, I was expecting my sea scallops to be around 30% larger in diameter, but realistically being in Pittsburgh the only scallops that are available are ones that are shipped from the coast.  The scallops were seared perfectly (but honestly now, searing sea scallops is not difficult).  The rice cakes were cooked properly, but they were miniscule in size and thickness, and overly salty from the \"spicy\" sauce, which had maybe quarter of a clove of minced garlic, and half a seeded chili pepper.  The bok choy was cooked beyond recognition, and basically became a sponge for the soy sauce.  The few strips of julienned pork was probably 2 oz. meat, and did not fit well with the dish as it got lost in the sauce.  DISHES THAT ARE SOUPY IN NATURE SHOULD HAVE LARGER PIECES OF MEAT; ONLY DISHES THAT HAVE MORE SOLID FOOD THAN LIQUID SHOULD BE ALLOWS TO USE SMALL PIECES OF MEAT.  I was not impressed at all.  Yes, I keep switching between soup and sauce; it's labeled as a sauce in the menu, and it was definitely too salty to be a soup, but it's consistency was that of soup, and it was served with one of those soup spoons you get with egg drop soup in Asian restaurants.  For it's price, SOBA should've been much better.  I would've given SOBA two stars, but our waiter was attentive and the ambiance was nice.",

    "text": "I am giving Soba 5 stars for the experience I had there, even though I'm not quite sure the food deserves the whole 5 stars (Maybe 4.5) My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary. We are poor college students we got dressed up for our special dinner. We ordered several small plates: the Indonesian corn fritter wrap, the spicy tuna maki, the chicken and vegetable spring rolls, the korean barbecue ribs, and... something else!  The ribs were probably the best, and the corn fritter and tuna maki were also great. I was disappointed by the spring rolls - they were of good quality, but they were somewhat bland, and I expect a little more at a place (and a price!) like this.  For dessert we had the vanilla-poached peach with raspberry granita, coconut tapioca and brown sugar-barley crisps - this was fabulous! The combination of textures and flavors was superb. This appears to no longer be on the menu. The real treat of the evening was the service we got from our waiter. We wanted to order sake, but we are sake noobs and had no idea where to start. Our waiter brought us a tasting tray of three very different sakes, all of which were delicious. We made a decision, ordered a carafe, and settled down to eat and drink and, uh, gaze lovingly into each other's eyes. As we were finishing our small plates, the waiter sidled up to our table and replaced our empty carafe with a full one, winking at us and saying \"Will you look at that!\"  We were very pleased with our experience at Soba and it made a great anniversary dinner.",

Great food - my boyfriend was nervous about trying Asian fusion for the first time but we were able to get familiar and delicious spring rolls and dumplings for appetizers.  For dinner we got seared tuna and scallops, our first foray into Pittsburgh seafood after moving here from NJ, and were not disappointed.  They have an extensive wine list (I had two generous glasses of angeline pinot noir) and a great-looking cocktail menu (I don't usually go for hard liquor but I found myself uncharacteristically indecisive with so many interesting-looking choices).  Pricey, but on par for the quality of food plus cocktails - would go back on another special occasion.  Also pleased to find they have a (albeit small) parking lot.",

    "text": "To start off with, let me tell you that I am big fan of this restaurant and the only reason Im writing this review is to praise it. SOBA has been my favorite restuarant in Pittsburgh that has class, good food, flavourful and each food is served with very good presentation. This restaurant has been the restaurant of choice for any occasion- celebration of job, or birthdays.  Being a vegetarian myself, they really dont have many options for vegetarians. but they ae ever so accommodating to make any pasta customized for vegetarian taste buds.  let me summarize the experiences-  1) the staff is friendly, polite and explain any dish to you if you ask them.  2) lovely lovely ambience. i love the water fountain inside the restuarant. 3) food is flavorful. a tip- the sides listed on the menu are usually small eats and work marvelously as an appetizer for two-three people. make sure you try them. 4) the presentation of the food is really good. matches with the flavor. 5) not a slow service 6) good selection of wines. again the staff explain the best combination for every meal. 7) desert- is top of the world. my personal recommendation- try the chocolate maki. its a desert that is truly creative and deserves five stars. it has chocolate mouse stuffed inside what is similar to a rice roll, instead its a chocoltae crepe. the wasabi is substituted with paste made of pista chocolate sauce becomes the vinegar and of course, ginger is as is. this is by far the best desert i have ever tasted in pittsburgh at any restuarant.   if you are looking for a romantic friday evening, or your first date or just a classy restuarant for celebration then i would highly recommend this. just be aware that the food is a little pricey and can easily run up for more than $100 for just 3 people including drinks.",
