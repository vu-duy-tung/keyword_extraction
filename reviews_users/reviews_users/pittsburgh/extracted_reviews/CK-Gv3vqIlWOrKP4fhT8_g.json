Not a fan of their wings.   Beer selection is on point and if you can't find what you want on tap, head into the beer cave. I like that you can find a crazy variety and try new beers. Always busy, so be prepared to wait.",

Everytime I go there i am greeted with fun young employees ready to serve or offer suggestions about their latest brews. Their draft list changes constantly so there's no sense in trying to remember which beer you had there the week before. Plus their beer cave is great with hundreds of different bottles to choose from all listed by the region from which they came. They also have a small cooler with about 150 different varieties of beer that are already chilled for your liking. Even if you get a warm beer, they have this ice cold dunk tank to put your bottle in that gets it nice and chilly for you in just a few minutes. That by far is my favorite aspect of D'z. If you choose to take beer home with you they also have a discount of $1.00 per bottle of every beer you take with you(excluding the pre-made six packs). So sometimes we get a six pack of variety beers at a lower cost than paying for them individually. On to the food:  I love their wings and hot dogs and my masterful veggie burger creation. We always order the BBQ sauce because it taste so gooooood and their wings are nice and crispy and hot and smothered in plenty of sauce that you will be licking your fingers. We've tried almost all their dogs expect 2 and my favorite is the mac and cheese dog(w/ ketchup) and the chihuahua dog which is avocado, shredded cheddar cheese and jalapenos, my fiance enjoys a classic Chicago dog. The have delicious sauerkraut that i enjoy as well so i usually get a side for only 99 cents. Can't beat that price. Now when it comes to the veggie burger i love the way it taste. I do it up real nice by getting that black n blue topping which is blue cheese and cajun seasoning. I add bacon, onion, mushrooms, avocado, tomato, lettuce and their spicy mayo/double dip sauce. It is hands down the best burger i've ordered in a loooong time.   If your looking for a fun hangout spot for you and your buddies or even a tasty treat for the kids then D'z is where it's at!!! It gives you the feeling of just a fun place to be on the weekend or even the weekdays.   Due to an unfortunate circumstance of eating at a different hotdog shop during restaurant week, my fiance would have proposed to me at D'z. We truly regret not waiting to go here but time was of the essence. D'z you truly are my favorite spot to be any day at any time and you will always be the place i wish i would have been proposed to at!!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "As if this place needs another glowing review!  When I first moved to Pittsburgh, a local clued me in to the wonders of D's. She leaned forward and whispered, \"....yeah 'suchandsuchbar' is alright, but if you want the BEST beer selection in Pittsburgh with the friendliest staff, go to D's Six Pax and Dogz.\"   She proceeded to give me directions. Mind you, this was a total stranger. But I liked the mystique so obviously I jumped in my car and found D's (her directions were perfect.)   Walking into the beer cave is an almost religious experience. What's this to my immediate left? Seasonal brews? Yes, I'll definitely have some of those. Trippel Belgians? Count me in. Beers brewed by monks? Of course. All the Dogfish Head and Rogue a girl could ever want? Double check. Giant bottles of Chimay? I must be dreaming. And if you thought things couldn't get any better, you're clearly not following along close enough-you get $1.00 off every bottle you take to go.   Bobby and I brought a friend here last night because he said he had never been. We stocked up on pumpkin beers and they even had Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale which I can never seem to find anywhere. Our friend was in awe. The only downside I can possibly think of when it comes to D's is the magical time powers that seem to exist in the beer cave. I kid you not, I've sometimes found myself in the beer cave for over 45 minutes agonizing over crafting the perfect six pack. Of course, this isn't D's fault. I'm naturally indecisive.   I love this place so good.",

The dogs come in all varieties (bratwurst, all beef, turkey dog, veggie dog) and you can mix and match any topping your heart desires. Prices are SO reasonable, especially at a time when it's tough to find great food for a reasonable price in this city. The best feature of D's is their beer cave to the rear of the restaurant. While your dinner companions peruse the menu, make sure you stop and take a good walk through their beer selection. You can pick from hundreds of domestic and imported beers from around the world, including some rare gems you'd have to special order anywhere else. Chill your beer there in minutes, or get a discount walking in and bringing home a single or six pack. They always have interesting offerings on tap as well. Highly recommended!",

Great Chicago dogs with all the fixings but so so Cuban dog with underwhelming toppings.Perhaps it was because their fryer was out but the toppings on the Cuban dog seemed to be out of a plastic pack from Giant  Eagle.The beer was fine a Belgian ale, probably the best part of my experience. The first server I had did get me a second glass of beer but although I asked for a menu never got back to me to see what I wanted to order.Eventually another server did and I ordered.So if you want a beer definitely come on over and for some of the hot dogs you'll be fine but if you want consistent service forget it This is the ultimate in bro style  service best suited to half loaded  college students or anyone with low expectations of service at a bar and grill.",

    "text": "Any bar and/or restaurant that has \"D's Nutz\" on their menu is great-grand-wonderful in my opinion.   Let's start with the beer. Say hello to barley-pop heaven here folks. Over 1,000 different types of brews? Holy--I thought I blacked out for a second. You take a stroll into either a walk-in cooler or a backroom lined with every beer under the sun, pick what you want and toss it into the complimentary cooler. This nifty little guy chills your bottle to whatever your desired temp is, fast! We're talking like 3-5 minutes. If it were just for the insanely intricate brew selection, D's would be a 5'er star, period.  Now, let's move on to some serious dog biz-nas. This place was recommended to me from a frank-lovin' Pittsburgh-ite as the best place in town to grab one. Welp, I ordered my very first Chicago-style hotdog and was not disappointed. In fact, holy-fantastic-hot-peppers! The toppings were all so delish and blended perfectly with the dog. It was cooked just right on the outside, inside and served up with a freshly steamed bun. Yum. We also skipped the fries and enjoyed a baked, soft pretzel instead. This thing was fluffy, chewy and delectable.   The only thing I would ask for more of is maybe a heftier frank. Don't get me wrong--everything was beyond delicious. I just noticed there wasn't much meatiness involved, and with all those topping options you want the hot dog to stand out too.   Besides that, the atmosphere, help and general vibe of this little joint was spot-on. If you're in the 'Burgh, you must stop by D's. Seriously.",

Hot dogs were excellent, and not as messy as I had anticipated; the fries were fantastic. Service was a bit slower than I would've expected for a lazy Monday afternoon. I don't think it takes very long to prepare a hot dog, so that's the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.",

However, the hot dogs were really good. I got the chicago beef dog. Wasn't a huge fan of the relish (don't really like sweet with savory) but I gave it shot. Friend got a custom turkey dog. He said the colesaw was great, as was the entire hot dog. We also split small chili cheese fries. They were fantastic. Fries were crispy. Service was fast.  Great selection of beer. I got the Seamus red ale. The beer cave is awesome.   Beware of the yellow mustard though. After several washings, my hands are still dyed yellow.",

I had the Chicago dog and the Red Alert dog, both were excellent. Service was good too, despite the fact the place was packed when I went. You can also carry your beers outside to smoke or just chat in warm weather even if the few outdoor bar tables aren't available. Non-pretentious atmosphere, despite the yuppies and hipsters infesting the area, which is a plus for me. I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "CM and I visited D's yesterday (Sat.) at around 7pm for dinner.  Given that CM lives right around the corner, and that I had a City Dining Card, D's had been on our list for awhile, and we were eager to check it out. We happened to arrive right when the Kentucky Derby was in full swing, and there wasn't a table to be had, so we gave our name to the hostess to be texted when a table became available (Note: D's uses NoWait).  Fortunately, we arrived right at the end of the derby, so several tables soon cleared out, and we received the text within 10 min., despite an estimated wait of 15 min.  Once we were seated at one of the high tops next to the mural, we perused the menu to decide what to order.  Because I don't eat beef, I decided to go with the turkey dog ($5.50), style of the month for May (topped with pierogies, onions, and sour cream), as well as a veggie dog ($5.50), Angry Tiki style (topped with bacon, pineapple, hoisin sauce, and spicy cheese sauce).  CM decided to go with the bratwurst dog ($6.50), Mason Dixon style (topped with chili and coleslaw) on a wheat bun (+$.50) and a turkey dog, Big Ben style (topped with fries, cheese wiz, and cole slaw).  In addition to the dogs, we ordered a large order of fries, pub style ($8).  The fries were brought out first, per our request, so that we could munch on them.  I'm pretty sure they were the largest order of fries I've ever received--they would have solved the Irish potato famine in a jiffy!  They came drenched in cheese wiz and generously sprinkled with real bacon bits (not Bac-Os!), with a sizeable cup of ranch dressing on the side, which we promptly poured on, as well (yeah!).  Despite all the dressings, the fries were pleasantly crispy, due to being of the battered variety.  However, over the course of our meal, they became progressively more soggy, due to the dressings soaking into them.  Between the two of us, we finished about 2/3 of them--not too shabby, esp. for people of our size!  As for the dogs, to my surprise, I was more of a fan of the Angry Tiki than the pierogi dog of the month.  When it comes to the dogs themselves, I preferred the turkey dog to the veggie dog, which I found bland.  However, the toppings of the Angry Tiki dog were so flavorful that they masked the blandness of the veggie dog, which was only detectable when I bit into it alone.  Although I thought the turkey dog itself was more flavorful, I wasn't impressed as much by the toppings, which consisted of what were no doubt Mrs. T's pierogies and too many grilled onions for my taste (I removed many of them).  CM preferred the turkey dog to the bratwurst dog, and the Big Ben to the Mason Dixon style slightly, but enjoyed both styles.  The service at D's was friendly and efficient--our orders were placed and fulfilled promptly and with a smile.  During the short time that we waited for our food, CM and I enjoyed examining the mural, which contains many real life and fictitious characters, and the monk decorations on the other wall.  Although we didn't order any beer, we checked out the beer cave before leaving, and were quite impressed with the selection--now CM has a neighborhood go-to spot the next time he needs to bring a six pack to a party!  With the City Dining Card, our total came to $23, which I felt was quite reasonable for the amount and quality of food received. In sum, we were very pleased with our experience at D's, and would definitely return, esp. in light of the proximity to CM's residence and the extensive beer selection.",

They're typically good, but not a place to take foodies (Franktuary would be the foodie hot dog joint).  The hot dogs are pretty good. If you look at the pictures, it's primarily hot dogs. The french frie servings are huge (but not Oakland O huge). Pizza is good. I'd recommends staying aware from the other options. I haven't been impressed with the hoagies and wings.  As a note, be careful with some of the bottles. I've had some old ones on occasion when I've picked some of the odder selections. That being said, this would be my pick for a bottle bar. They don't have the massive Belgian selection that is Sharp Edge, but the service is 10x better.",

We sat down at the bar, and the bartender refused to even acknowledge us, let alone serve us.  So we switched to the other side of the space.  The service on the other side was better but a tad slow.  I started with the macaroni and cheese ($3.00).  It was just doctored Kraft mac and cheese, with a bit too much salt, but for the price is was reasonable and good.  I ordered a Chicago dog ($5.50), and the hot dog was an all star for the most part.  It was an authentic Chicago style dog, and the toppings were fantastic.  My friend ordered a Big Ben hot dog, and it was pretty gross.  The cheese picked up the vinegar-y taste from the coleslaw, and it made the cheese taste sour.  Not appetizing at all.    D's grills their hot dogs, which is normally fine.  However, both my friend and my dogs came out very burnt.  One of hers was literally inedible, and these hot dogs are pricey.  The server did not say anything about the practically untouched hot dog and just took it off of the table.  They do have some daily or lunch specials for cheaper hot dogs so check that out.  The verdict?  I would come back here for a Chicago dog and ask them to boil it to prevent the risk of a singed dog, and I would return for the beer cave.",

I'm more of a natural casing kind of guy a little crunchy outside with a delicious juicy pork filled gem on the inside. So although these dogs didn't have the crisp I'm used to they were phenomenal. There were some crazy toppings that all looked ridiculously good. I got the mason dixon with chili and slaw, but the angry tiki was out of this world with bacon pineapple and a spicy hoisin sauce. Oh and by the way they have 1000 beers in their walkin cooler to pick from. This is a fine fine establishment.",

After breakfast, we ventured over and bellied up to the bar. My brother had a few beermosas with an IPA. He compared it to Blue Moon with an orange... but better. I had a few basic Mimosas (although they offered a few different varieties) and tasted a few beers. I also, tried one of their hot dogz with jalapenos and cheese. It was really great! They had a nice selection of craft beers and even offered some options for brunch (besides dogz). So you could totally eat there for breakfast. The 6 pack shop is connected and has tables you can sit at. I was really impressed, the employees were nice and accommodating. Really neat place. I'm excited to come back.",

Prices for pizza are incredibly reasonable, and the Texas BBQ never fails to disappoint. I don't drink, but the beer cave is no doubt very impressive for beer fans.  My only negative would be how packed the place gets when the bar crowd rolls in, but if we're ordering dinner, we just take it to go. I'm assuming the crowd would be a positive for some people, so I'm not going to bother taking a star off for it.  Good hot dogs, good pizza, good wings, good sweet potato fries. D's is what's up.",

I ordered a chili dog because I am not insane and their spicy cheese dog! Both were delicious! The spicy cheese dog had pepper cheese and pickled relish on it and I love anything pickled! The chili dog was also really hearty but I did wish there were jalapenos on it. i suppose I could have gotten them and am just lazy. Either way, great food!

Also, do yourself a favor and wear your stretchy pants because you're probably going to order the largest order of fries and eat until you can't breathe. (On another note, the small order of fries will feed 2-3 people easily.)  You'd be hard pressed to find such a vast selection of beers, the make your own 6 pack is one of the greatest things and they always have a killer array to pick from as well as seasonal beers that you're not going to find elsewhere.",

The menu has so many options!  There was a 30 minute wait when we showed up at 8:30.  That was discouraging at first but with all the options thirty minutes was no big deal.  I got the Hawaiian Hot Dog (it's not called that, it's just the one with the pineapple and bacon).  It was a pretty solid choice.  I also got the macaroni and cheese.  I was very happy that it was $3 but I guess you get what you pay for.  It did taste like it was a box of Kraft Mac and cheese.  So not really original or special but definitely classic.  I also ordered a hard cider. It was on draft and $8.50.   I thought that was pretty pricey for a draft beer, however it's probably one of the smoothest ciders that I've had, so it may have been worth it to some degree.  All and all, it was a nice choice on the fly.",

Think high-end bottle shop, organized by country of origin.  There are some really rare finds that rotate through, plus all the favorites as well.  Anything in the beer cave (I thik there are over 1000 brands!) can be taken over to the eating area, and there is a rapid chiller to cool down your unrefrigerated bottles.  There is also a large walk in fridge to grab beers as well.  The eat-in area serves a variety of quite good bar food, although I've only had the hot dogs once or twice.  The fries are great, and the draft selection in this area is awesome as well.    Overall, go here if you want a great beer selection and good bar food.  It's always pretty busy and the service is good!",

At happy hour, I had incredible Belgian wheat beer for about $3 and even the pizza wasn't bad.    For the upscale beer they serve, the place isn't trendy or yuppie.  You go to the cooler in the back and just grab your own bottle or ask for a pour of whatever they have on draft (it changes often).  They even let you make your own six packs and walk off with them.   The music is good, and not played too loud so that you can talk to your fellow pubcrawlers.  Highest endorsement.

Coolers line the back wall and part of the perimeter of the store. If you get take out, it's a dollar off a bottle! Yayyy.   They also have a cooler that (I think) is constantly reserved for whatever seasonal beers are appropriate at the time. Mmmmmm.  Try the Roethlisberger hot dog, it's got cole slaw and french fries on it.",

    "text": "I thought D's was beer mecca of Western PA until i recently discovered House Of A Thousand Beers. The latter is a bit of a drive, but you won't see anything like it in the area. That being said, I stopped in Ds today and i must say the cave is slowly but surely going down hill. They use to have countless hard to find beers, Ottos, etc. Hardly saw any of that today. And what specialty beers they do have costs an arm and a leg, and can be found for cheaper elsewhere. For example, $14 for a 12 oz bottle of Wulver and $25 for a bottle of Angel Share! Whoever is actually subjecting themselves to those outrageous prices are literally getting robbed. You can find a $25 four pack of Wulver and a $10 single of Angel Share at Giant Eagle.. In fact, you can find most of the beers in the cave at Giant Eagle at a much lower price... Shop smart and mix and match a sixer at Giant Eagle for half the price.",

I went here and had the bacon chili cheddar dog and one with relish, kraut, and brown mustard.  Both were excellent dogs, and their beer list is incredible.    Again, how come we can't have this is Boston, where it comes off as real?  If they tried this in NYC or Boston, it would come off as a gimmick.  Whereas here, in Swissvale, it just seems like a neighborhood place with a twist.  A coronary twist.  So good.....",

The real jewel, though, is in the back. You have the beer cave with hundreds of different types of cold beers for carry out, or you can build your own six pack from the unchilled beers and chill them on the spot. D's is still the only place I've ever found the elusive Hopfenweisen by SchneiderWeiss and Brooklyn Brewery, perhaps the best beer I've ever had.  While D's is worth it for the beer alone, the food's not bad either. The pizza is average, but they truly do have the best hot dogs in the city.  Finally, bring a growler or buy one of theirs. Prices are reasonable and the selection is outstanding.",

They had a lot of local seasonals on tap, but I had to drive and I was tired, so I stuck to only one.  Food was decent.  Typical bar/grill menu.  We ordered up some Pub Fries and Wings.  Decent, nothing special, but I wasn't expecting the world.  My friend got a Chicago dog that looked amazing.",

The beer cave is an experience and you will not be letdown. I have yet to meet someone who feels that D's is anything less than stellar.  Sidenote: I highly recommend D's Sixpax for someone's 21st birthday to pick out a six-pack from their epic selection of brews. (Also, buy them a hot dog, cheapskate!)",

It's because it's a groovy little place with young hipster (and some not so hipster) bartenders and waitresses that serves up an endless array of beers in a funky loud space.  I love Regent Square and always saw the potential for the grand old days of Hippy Free Love lying dormant in her quaint shops and family eateries ... until D's sprang to life in a former dry cleaner/gun shop space.  Oh yes, how the times have changed and we are all so thankful for it.  Big KUDOS to the D's Empire in Regent Square -- the Beer Distributor, D's Six Packs and Dogs, and the newest entrant Cibo!  Well done!  Stop on in for a nice hot pizza (I loved the Frickin Parker with meat balls and hot peppers but alas, it has been banished to the basement beer dungeon for-evah!) or a mediocre hotdog and languish in the beer heaven known simply as D's. They also have a smoky dark strange but intriguing (if you've had enough beer downstairs) bar upstairs now that serves alcohol.",

Last time I went they had a variety of pumpkin beers and I pretty much tried them all to figure out which I liked best. If you aren't feeling any of the beers on tap then take a stroll to the walk in cooler in the back and take your pick of hundreds of bottles. Bring the one you like back to the bar and the bartender will open it for you and bring you a glass.   The bartenders are really chill, and though the service isn't overly attentive, it is perfect for the vibe of D's. And speaking of the vibe, D's has this old pub style feel with the walls meeting at strange angles making cool little nooks and crannies where you can sit and sip your beer with friends or maybe just read a book.  D's is also known for their hot dogs, and while good and inventive, in my opinion are a little overpriced. For some reason I have trouble spending $5 for a hot dog. I've tried their wings and fries too, both good standard bar food, but again a tad overpriced. My friend and I drank beers (a good amount) and ordered food and our tab was $100.  D's still remains the gem of Regent Square and is worth the pilgrimage to Beer Mecca if you have never been.",

We were invited to check out the Beer Cave while we waited and their selection does not disappoint. Having just moved to PGH from San Diego, we appreciated the craft staples from Stone, Ballast Point and Mission that they had on hand. I wish they could get a couple of Lost Coast, Mother Earth and Shiner varieties in there since they are some of my favorites.   As for the dogs, we had the Chicago and the Angry Tiki. The Chicago was delicious and something I would definitely order again. My husband had the Angry Tiki and said that it seemed to have too much going on, but he ate all of it and thought it was still quite tasty. We also ordered a side of D's Chips and were offered a choice of sauce to dip them in. I declined but am thinking now it would have been better to take a sauce. The chips were good, don't get me wrong... But if you're offered sauce, go for the sauce! You don't have to use it, right?  We will definitely be back. Hopefully on a Saturday again so that we can go for a Bloody Mary and buy a 6-pack to go.",

Rather than write a long review and clutter the reviews with anymore long reviews (no knock, you guys are great) I'm just gonna get right to the point...  This place?   Without a doubt go here.  Every and any beer you could ever want. Nice staff. French fries from heaven. Hotdog creations similar to Van Gogh. A speedy beer chiller. TVs at all the right angles. A bar and a dining area. Did I say beer cave?  Go, just go.",

    "text": "My wife and I were here a few years ago on one of our many trips to Pittsburgh and had to come back.  The first time I was there I had a Chicago Dog which was delicious. I can't remember what my wife had but it was so good she insisted we make it back on out most recent trip.  We stopped by around dinner time on Saturday and the place was hopping. We sat on the bar side which was even louder than the restaurant but fine for us to have dinner. The staff was all very nice and gave our option of eating outside, at a table by the bar or waiting for one in the actual restaurant.  Since my last trip I became a vegetarian and stick to a pretty strict low sodium diet so I didn't try the vegan hot dog (though I may next time I visit). I was happy to see the other vegetarian options which were on the healthier side. I ended up getting the grilled veggie salad which was so large I had it for dinner another night.  My wife (who is NOT a vegetarian) had Bacon Cheddar dag and a handful or fries pub style and said both were delicious.  We both had the draft root beer which is absolutely delicious.  Maybe it's because I'm not from the area but I don't think the prices are THAT high, for what you are getting the seem reasonable to me but I can see how to compared to some other places it may feel like you are paying a lot for what you are getting. To me it's worth every dime.  I actually love hot dogs which was the reason we came here in the first place but we love the food so much there that I am more than happy to get a salad or another one of the healthier options.",

    "text": "In December 2016 my husband and I bought a house in Swissvale and immediately found D's. D's became our go to local spot for dinner and beers. We've been going to D's 2-3X/month for almost the past two years. When friends come in from out-of-town we take them to our favorite bar...D's. The service has always been excellent....fast and friendly, even on busy nights.   On November 14, 2018 we went to D's to celebrate my bother's birthday. My husband and I sat at one of the back tables in the bar area. Our drink order was taken quickly by one of the usual waiters. My brother and his wife arrived about 15 minutes later and a waitress came to take our food and drink order. Since my brother and his wife had literally just sat down they were not ready to order, but placed a drink order which came quickly. We did not see the waitress for approximately 20-30 minutes (this is unusual for D's). When she did eventually take our order, the food came out quickly. While we were eating a different waiter placed the check on our table. We paid but were still eating and drinking. A few minutes later the waiter came over and told us that they had a large party waiting and if we could finish our beers/food and leave in about 3 minutes that would be great. I was shocked. We still had a beer, fries, and hummus that we were working on. I felt like I was being kicked out.   I feel as though there are better ways of handling this situtation. For example, our order could have been taken earlier. Also, we could have been asked to move to a different table that would accomodate 4 instead of 6. In addition, the waiter could have said, \"Happy Hour is ending in about 40 minutes...do you want anything else? or Would you like a box for your food to take home?\" to see if we were truly finished, instead he asked us to leave.   D's...not mad. Disappointed...you're better than that.",

Well, that's how D's does dogs...  Just your local neighborhood beer cave with an incredible all-beef hotdog... nbd.  But they are a big deal in flavor.  A mural of Pittsburgh heroes graces the wall and a hefty beer list awaits.  Can't find one you like on tap?  Check the cave, but make sure your waiter pops the top for you. Still can't find one you like?  Well then we can no longer be friends...  The menu has everything from hummus to homemade pizza and it's all delicious.  Today I ordered a chili and cheese dog and another topped with Mac n Cheese.  Both incredibly delicious and filling.  They have their specialty dogs like the Mason Dixon  (dog with chili and coleslaw) or the Chihuahua  (salsa, jalapenos, and other deliciousness), or you can top it your own special way.  You can't go wrong with these puppies... or doggies... you get the idea.  Next trip I'll be adding Mac n cheese to my chili dog.  Why not combine the two toppings, right?  My mouth will be so very happy.",

    "text": "How have I lived in the 'Burgh for so long and have never been to D's?! The travesty! We went for beer and hot dogs but, judging by the looks of everyone else, the rest of the menu and drink options are just as good...  Let's start with the poppyseed bun...just doesn't get better than that. My hubby and I each ordered multiple dogs - so I was able to sample his as well.  The Chicago is *gasp* just as good as if you were in Chicago. The Chihuahua is like if a hot dog and a taco got married - yum! The Mac'N'Cheese dog weighs 20 pounds but is worth it just for the delicious mac. The Cuban is everything you love about Cubans but in hot dog form. The Angry Tiki was my favorite: pineapple, bacon, hoison, and Double Dip sauce - um, yes please!   I'm not a huge fan of the deep-fried/double-fried french fries but they were at least fresh and piping hot. Also, there are plenty of options for kids to eat. Plus, to keep everyone occupied while you wait, there's coloring sheets and TVs everywhere.  The beer menu at D's is just as satisfying, with every type and pour size you could imagine. I'm pretty picky with my beers but had no problem finding more than a few that I wanted; and, my hubby is an IPA aficionado and was over the moon to find a Triple on the board.  One downside to D's are that it is pretty small on the bar side - and a there's a long wait on the restaurant side. It is also extremely loud and can get warm when it's packed.   The only other con, which is more of a symptom of our voluntary gluttony, is you will leave feeling uncomfortably full :)  Overall, I LOVED the food at D's - and the bill wasn't that bad either. I highly recommend it for a yummy lunch or dinner and drinks with friends or the whole family!",

My favorite is the Chihuahua dog which has cheddar cheese, jalapenos, and avocado cream sauce.  I usually order a side of sweet potato fries or mac and cheese so that I am not tempted to order a second dog (how exactly that works out in my mind...don't ask me).   The house wine is what you'd expect from a beer joint, but it's drinkable and not ridiculously price.   The service has a diner feel to it, but they usually get it right.",

I got the Chihuahua dog which was covered in cheddar cheese, jalapeno's and avocado cream sauce. I wish I hadn't already eaten brunch, which lead into lunch or I would have gotten more.   They also have a massive selection of beer on tap, as well as the crown jewel, a beer cave! What's a beer cave you ask? Well, it's a large room full of tons of bottle craft brews from all over. They even have a smaller refrigerated section if you need a cold brew asap!   I was stoked to see Sly Fox Christmas Ale not only on tap, but in the beer cave... although I did snag the last sad can of it in the cave. That's okay, just an excuse to come back. Not to mention more buns (and hot dogs to go with!).",

But regardless if you're looking for a laid back atmosphere and some good hot dogs and beer, then this is your spot. D's is family friendly and I always see people of all ages sitting and eating. Half of the place has low top tables and table service, and the other side is seat yourself with a bar with some high top tables that also have table service. The waitstaff is super laid back and the menu is pretty straight forward American style things. A typical night for our group consists of some hot dogs, chicken tenders, and a few baskets of fries with guacamole and cheese.   The main draw for me is their huge beer cave. You can feel free to walk back and wander around and pick any beer that you're feeling. They have a refrigerated section and a non refrigerated section. They also have a small chilling stand that you can pop your warm beer in to get it cold enough for you. They also always have a lot of good unique beers on tap.",

Organized by region and type etc. Very reasonably priced per bottle price as well as a chiller to cool your options. They also have a huge selection of drafts! Great choice for a fancy 6-pack.   The Staff: The staff is a great mix of no-nonsense service and get what you ask for. Last I was there was for St. Patty's Day so it was super packed, but the service was still excellent.  I was struggling with a bottle of almost-empty ketchup and my waiter literally came over and switched it out with a full bottle mid-squeeze. What a guy! There was a wait but I we were sat very quickly, using a neat app they have!  The Ambience  Has a dive bar feel with a cleaner up-keep. TVs already around for the sports aficionado.

High points of the sandwich menu: The giant fish, the Big Ben cheesesteak (toppings include fries & coleslaw), and the half-pound keilbasa with horseradish, brown mustard, and sauerkraut.   Good pizzas too. The Swissvale Shroom is awesome mushroomy goodness, and I love the Popeye's on a whole wheat crust.  One big warning: Service is wonky, especially if you order both pizza and sandwiches. The pizza kitchen is on a different schedule from the sandwich/dogs kitchen, and they make _no_ attempt to coordinate. Pizzas take 30 minutes and dogs take 10-15, so if you order a sandwich and your buddy orders a pizza, you'll be finished eating before his food gets there.   Down sides:  - The burgers are not very good. They come out large and dry.  - Service is quirky (as mentioned above).  - Gets crowded, especially on weekends. They frequently have a seating list in the dining room side, but I think the bar side is still \"grab a table\" - that's confusing.   Beer only, though they've opened the \"loft\" upstairs that seems to have a full bar - I haven't been there.",

And in VA we don't have absurd old beer and wine control laws, meaning our access to reasonably priced, intelligently stocked beer is much higher than pittsburgh.  That said, the best selection of beer I've found in this city has been at D's.  You will find a number of american craft brews, trappist ales, etc.  The only problem is the price...  which is solvable.  D's has a great system, if you buy a bottle of beer to take out of the restaurant they take 1 dollar off the bottle.  This dollar off doesn't matter when you consider how small a normal bottle is, but when you look at the larger bottles it does.  The prices for their larger bottles with the dollar off are not much higher than you would pay in a specialty beer shop in a less regulated state.  The only problem is that you have to commit to drinking three or four beers instead of one - I'm not really seeing the issue with that, but I'm sure someone will.    Also, I've never eaten here, because hot dogs are generally not good.  Furthermore, I'm not sure why anyone would go to a hot-dog joint and expect good service.  So ignore anyone talking about hot-dogs and come here for the beer. Finally, parking sucks there's a lot of very busy restaurants and businesses on the same street, so expect to walk a little.",

    "text": "If you live in the East End of town, you're familiar with D's 6-pack and Dogz.  It's located on Braddock Avenue, and is always packed to the gills with hungry customers and beer drinkers.  D's is a comfortable restaurant/bar to meet with friends.  It was originally half its size before expanding a few years ago.  Now, instead of just a small bar area, (where coolers took up much of the space) there is an additional dining room that offers seating for 50 people.  Since the expansion and the smoke-free laws were passed, you can now bring your family for dinner.  We ate at D's last night and saw several families with their children enjoying hot dogs, cheese-covered french fries, and hamburgers.  Another lure of D's is the selection of beers.  If you're looking for a specific import or domestic brew chances are you will find it in the \"Beer Cave.\"  The beer cave is a large room in the back of the restaurant that is stocked with brews from all over the world.  You can grab a 6-pack, and mix and match your selections.  One of the nice things about D's is that you can go get your own beer.  Simply go to a cooler, make a selection, and take it to your table.  Whatever you do, don't open the bottle yourself, that's a BIG no-no.  The wait staff are the only people permitted to open your bottle for you, this way they can keep track and charge you appropriately.  If you've never been to D's it's worthwhile to go just to see the artwork on the walls.  A very gifted artist has painted murals, caricatures, and other various objects on the walls.  If you look closely you can find Darth Vader, Terry Bradshaw, and many other Pittsburgh icons.  The food at D's is very good.  If you're not in the mood for a hot dog, they have great salads and cheesy pizzas.  In the summer time a large garage door opens on the facade of the building exposing the patrons to the hustling and bustling on Braddock Avenue.  There is an additional location of D's 6-pack and Dogz in Monroeville.    Mon - Wed: 11 a.m. 11 p.m. Thurs - Sat: 11 a.m. Midnight Sunday: 11 a.m. 10 p.m.  D's Six Pax & Dogz 1118 S. Braddock Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15218 412-241-4666  D's Six Pax & Dogz 4320 Northern Pike Monroeville, PA 15146 412-856-5666",

But the drink selection might not even be the best part, as the food here was awesome. I went with the Chicago Dog for a modest four bucks, and it was as good as any I'd ever had - perfectly grilled dog, all the right high-quality toppings and a fresh-tasting bun. The pub fries sealed the deal though - a huge pile of fries with generous helpings of perfectly-melted cheese and just-soft-enough-just-crispy-enough bacon. My friend and I could have shared the large order of Pub Fries and been just fine. I saw someone's sandwich across the bar, and it was truly enormous - I could come here with a friend and for ten bucks, get my fill of sandwich, fries and beer for the rest of the day. Great value, great experience!!",

    "text": "I don't understand the hype for D's, although I guess their beer selection *does* rule.  If selection drives your decision-making, definitely head on over.  However, if you'd like to receive anything other than slow, resentful service from your waitstaff, or food that is anything above sub-par, head on by without stopping.  I've lived just down Forbes from D's for 3 yrs, and walk down there with friends a lot during the summer and early fall.  I'm also a former bartender and waitress, so I can say with experience and certainty that I've received just downright terrible service there about 80% of the times I've been.  Once, a friend and I stopped in for lunch with her kids and ended up waiting for the check 18 minutes after we'd asked to receive it.  We were both fuming, and the waitress just looked annoyed and kept ignoring us to chat with her buddy.  Another time, my husband and I came in 15 minutes before the ordering deadline, and watched as the waitress did not approach our table until exactly the cut-off time.  She proudly announced that we could no longer order food (we just wanted pretzels, for god's sake).  Food is pretty lackluster, although it's a nice touch that they have veggie dogs.  Upstairs, expect about the same level of service, with a douchy element of annoyed resentment from the bartender, along with even douchy-ier clientele.   I know D's is a favorite neighborhood place, but I'm tired of the abuse from waitstaff who look annoyed that I'm even there.  If this was just a once-in-a-while occurrence, I'd be forgiving, but 3 years is long enough to judge.",

Dee-licious!  Stopped in here before seeing a movie at the Regent Square Theater for some beers, dogs and chili cheese fries.  I had two IPAs that were good and reasonably priced.  I couldn't finish the fries so I took them with me to the movie theater and the lady didn't mind that I brought them in.  I finished them fairly quickly once the movie started (I was seeing the Swedish version of \"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" so this was a while ago.)  Also, since I was just visiting town, I didn't have a car and I rode the bus there all the way by myself!  So the point is, you can eat here and get a great dog and good beer, and you can also take the bus here and then see a movie.",

I spied D's Sixpax & Dogz I think because of it's open air concept.  the tables weren't outside but inside next to the window and I noticed there was no glass on said window.  Yay!  Let's head inside to nosh and get a nice breeze.  It has a nice atmosphere -- a nice bar pub and enough people dining to get the feeling it's a happening place.    I have the feeling dogs are the popular item based on the name of the place but I'm really not a hotdog fan except at sporting events so I opted for the Black 'n Blue Burger smothered with bleu cheese and cajun seasoning.  It comes with homestyle chips and I added an order of coleslaw. Wonderful burger -- big, moist and tasty!  Definitely hit the spot (multiple spots, actually).  Very satisfying lunch.  Side bonus for me -- happened to hear music from a local band from Denver (former homestead) while dining.  Made me homesick.",

My mind was buzzing...or maybe that could  have been the raspberry ale I chosen from the beer cave prior to me sitting down.    To say this hot dog is good is an insult to D's.  You better be prepared to say this hot dog is delicious, out of this world, life altering.......and maybe even orgasmic :O  The mixture of the poppy seed bun, coleslaw, fries, cheese, and beefy goodness....heaven.  Pub fries, pub fries, oi, Oi, OI!  Some of the best fried up taters I've ever had.  And to put some cheesy goodness on there was amazing.  But the best part was the cooked oh so right bacon that kind of melted in your mouth.  Sounds salty, no?  That's what the ranch is for.  I have no idea why I waited so long to try this place out, I should be shunned for this.  If you are to shun me, shun me back to the beer cave, there are still several other beers I would love to try.  The wait staff kind of remind you of worker bees.

    "text": "D's is one of our favorite places in Pittsburgh. It's nice to have an easy, fun, casual place to get some good eats and a nice beer. As a vegetarian who still likes to pretend to eat meat, I so appreciate their multiple veggie options. Nearly any item on the menu can be made in a vegetarian version. Their special dogs (dog of the month) are usually a lot of fun. My favorite was the Thanksgiving dog back in November, with corn, mashed potatoes, cranberry, and stuffing. It was amazing! I came twice to have one in November.   Their beer list has to be the best I've seen in the city. Lots of great stuff on tap and a huge bottle room.   Since we like to bring our toddler to dine with us, I'm always so happy that they are so friendly and accommodating with kids. He loves their mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches, though I think he likes their crayons more.  For a fun family dinner, a good beer, watching a game, getting together with friends, or just experimenting with a new Belgian brew, I strongly recommend D's.",

I was excited to try their cauliflower wings, but it turned out that they have now switched over to seitan. Even so, the two different orders my friends and I shared were both very tasty, although very fried and crunchy, compared to the meatier seitan wings served up elsewhere in Pittsburgh.  Their vegan dog on a poppy seed bun comes with unlimited toppings, for just 4.99! They somehow managed to get avocado, grilled onions, tomato, pickle spears, brown mustard, and banana peppers stacked into mine, and it was delicious and filling. I'd love to see a homemade vegan dog instead of using Yve's, but the toppings deal makes it worth it!  Definitely will be back for more :)",

    "text": "The best hot dog I've had. Ever. I also have to say trying to decide which hot dog I wanted was by far one of the hardest decisions I have had to make (food-wise). Eventually, I got the chihuahua dog because it was out of the box and I wanted try something new. It comes with avocado spread, salsa, cheddar cheese, and jalapenos. The dog itself was perfectly crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside and really just the best I have had. The toppings were great and I was happy I gave it a try. My friend got the bacon and cheese dog. I was expecting bacon bit type bacon, but they were full strips of bacon that were perfectly crisp and the melted cheese was right on. I am certainly going to come back and try a new hot dog. I am very exciting to finally have a hot dog place that I know produces fantastic tasting hot dogs.   I would definitely recommend you give this place a try.",

I'm not sure if it's the largest collection of bottles, but it's pretty impressive nonetheless.  I just wish that the beers I wanted had the prices labeled.  I swear, every one I grabbed for had price tags on the beers surrounding it but not on the one I wanted.  Anyway, the dogs are tender and juicy.  Even the veggie dogs are pretty convincingly \"dog-like.\"  The fries are plentiful and pretty damn good.  Greasy and salty (but not too much of either) and a perfect accompaniment to beers and hot dogs.  The servers are friendly and helpful with the menu.  Pros: great beer selection, wonderful food, friendly staff Cons: I was here after brunch to catch the hockey game and they had NCAA basketball on instead; not a big deal, but enough to be annoying",

Maybe it attracts a certain kind of younger crowd, but it is truly a no-frills kind of place and the people working there could not be more friendly and accommodating. The first time I came here our server was super chill and chatty with us as well as patient while we took our time figuring out how many add-ons to pile on top of our food despite the busy atmosphere of the place.  The food is cheap and hits the spot, for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. I will say their seitan wings were particularly crunchy/dry and not altogether satisfying shared between people, but the flavors were great.  But let's be real, you're probably coming here for the dogs. It's cool, I do too. And you will probably want to add avocado to whatever it is you're getting, because avocado is for winners, just like the ocean.  One night, during some seriously biblical amounts of rain and lightning, the power went out temporarily and workers and patrons alike kept on going like it was -no big deal-, demonstrating that the strength of D's can weather any storm.",

It's rare that she has almost as many choices as I do, but D's delivers on that front! The veggie dogs are actually very tasty and it's great that there are a variety of vegetarian offerings. The mac n cheese dog is unique and fun, but probably not something I'd get regularly. The vegetarian pub fries were something I hadn't had elsewhere and they were very good. Not light on the calories, but definitely tasty. I've tried a few other dogs and you can't go wrong. If you're a beer drinker, that's just icing on the cake!",

However, their service has consistently gone downhill over the year or so I've been a patron. Tonight was the worst. There were 3 servers/hostesses for a decent crowd, not packed, but steady. However, none of them seemed to be paying any attention to any of the customers.  We were seated immediately, but it took about 10 minutes for someone to come take our order, and then she was extremely short with us. Then, we quickly received our food, but were done for between 10-15 minutes before a different server came back, who we asked for the bill. We are still waiting after the time it has taken me to write this entire review. My fiancee pointed out that we could get up and leave and nobody would notice at all.  TLDR: solid food, but don't expect good service... Or any service for that matter.",

Located in Regent Square it has the perfect neighborhood vibe in combination with a fantastic sports bar. The menu consists of bar food that has been elevated to a new level. The fries are double fried so they have that extra crunch that everybody loves. The hot dogs come in all different styles, ranging from chili and cheese to an avocado and jalapeno topped dog. I had the Big Ben which came topped with cheese, fries and Cole slaw. The bun was big enough to contain all of the toppings, which is critical when you eat hot dogs like this. The casing had that bite I love in a hot dog, each bite sounding wth a snap. It had the taste that brought me back to my childhood. What differentiates this hot dog from the others were the toppings. The slaw and fries tasted so good and balanced out the hot dog flavor.   My only critique is that the whole bite was one dimensional. The fries were a bit soggy after being covered in the slaw, I wish they were put on top to give that desired crunch. to each bite. Even the addition of bacon or tortilla strips would provide the crunch.",

The dogs are good, and they let you go completely crazy on the toppings if you want to--but again, all the decisions!    I threw myself head-first into the beer-cave-and-topping fracas and have no regrets, but I also respect my cousin's strategy, sticking to their tap list and pre-made topping suggestions. Whatever your approach, get the sweet potato waffle fries, which are nothing short of amazing.    They have a number of gluten free beers and ciders, and will wrap your dog in a corn tortilla instead of a bun, but the grill and oil are all shared, so cross contamination is possible. Also, the fries are beer battered, so stick to the sweet potato fries if you're GF.",

There was a bit of a wait (about 15 minutes) before we were seated at a table. We got the garlic butter wings, pub fries, and chose kielbasa for our hot dogs. We LOVED the garlic butter wings. I don't think I've ever had such great wings before. They were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and had so much flavor. We also really enjoyed the pub fries. The hot dogs, however, were just mediocre. It took them a long time to get our food to us, but they apologized and gave us two free hot dogs cards for next time. Although I can't honestly say that the hot dogs are that amazing here (even with the kielbasa), I'm sure we'll be back for the delicious wings and the fries.

So Josh decided that this was the place to be randomly on a Wednesday at 9:30. He made the right choice.   He ordered the Angry Tiki, and the Big Ben. Their special on Wednesday nights is any dog and fries for $6. (In all honesty, josh can't get away anywhere without two meals.) I was lucky enough for him to let me try both. They were great. The tiki was weird, at first, but everything came together in the end. The Big Ben was perfectly strange. Whom ever came up with putting cole slaw on everything in Pittsburgh is a genius. He also had a side of sweet potato fries. They were okay, the one that I had was kind of underdone, but they were still good.   I played it safe with the bacon cheese dog. It was great! Two slice of bacon; and a big blob of cheesy goodness. My fries were crispy, and their ranch tasted as close to eat n parks as you could get! I want more already.   Go. Drink. Be merry. Eat the dogs and enjoy.   Happy Eating!",

Somehow bobby and i both ordered a chili cheese dog as well as a bacon cheddar. We shared a *small* cheese fry which was huge. Bobby took the servers suggestion of blue point's toasted lager. I tried it and it wasnt bad (im not a dark beer person) Our dogs were huge as well. We each ended up taking one home.  After our meal we headed to both the cooler and beer cave area. The variety was endless! I wasn't familar with too many of the breweries, but i was excited to just get some and try them out. I ended up only choosing 2 of Hofbrahaus' Hefe Weizen (my fav!!!!) Bobby picked out 4 others that i will try. They had soooo many different options. I was excited to find beers from Hofbrahaus & Fat Heads. how cool.",

Sometimes you just want fries and a beer! D's fries are great, some of the best I've had. And having the beer cave is a great add-on, no worrying about what's on draft. You can find whatever that suits you and try new things! Burgers are also a good value and leave you stuffed.  The rest of the food menu is pretty bland. Dogs are OK but on the overpriced, as are the sandwiches/hoagies. Staff is usually attentive, and if I can't find my server, I can always flag someone else down with no hassle. The drafts are over-priced and can be hit or miss.   What really takes D's down is this: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.post-gazette.com%2Flife%2Fdrinks%2F2017%2F11%2F06%2FD-s-Six-Pax-Dogz-blackface-halloween%2Fstories%2F201711060112&s=2ea2c9e8f3b99e0ebee3e05a53467379bb74ad5ef63ecd7d0f93a71a79271bea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">post-gazette.com/life/dr...</a>  In a neighborhood where residents found a noose in front of their house, a business who's owner who thinks it's OK to use shoe polish as part of a Halloween costume and then a 'sorry I offended anyone post' isn't one I want to patronize.

It really is the place (if you go often enough) that everyone really does know your name....as well as what you like. Or in my case...the only beer I actually like enough to drink more than once.  The bartenders are all amazing people and really make you feel comfortable. The service is great and they are always ready with a recommendation for any newbies. All it takes is a few questions and they have a few suggestions. I have a friend who loves Magic Hat, and when finding out that D's didn't have it on tap that night, was totally bummed. When she told the bartender that she usually drinks MH, he made a recommendation. I was not at all surprised (she was) when she loved what he'd suggested.   Your trip to D's wouldn't be complete without trying something from their extensive menu. Their hot dogs are great (and for those of you who are vegetarian, they have awesome veggie dogs), the pizza is delicious, and if you're craving wings, there's no better place to go (try the Jamaican jerk...they're my favorite!).  Okay, so you're thinking good beer, good food, good service, what more could they possibly offer?  DON'T LEAVE YET! Before you head home, hit the beer cave and take some to go. If you can't find something to drink here, you may just be too picky (or a non drinker, which is totally okay, but I would suggest the root beer they have on tap before you give up.)   My sister and I stopped in over the weekend for some pizza. We had the pleasure of meeting Dino, the owner. He's incredibly friendly and just a nice guy ( he bought us both a drink!). We chatted for a bit, and he moved on to greet some other patrons. I think it says a lot about  any place when owners and employees alike can be found there on a day off.   If you're visiting Pittsburgh and anywhere close (heck...even if you aren't close) head to D's and grab a taste of a great local bar",

I've been to D's a couple of times with groups of friends, and this is quite a fun and neighborhoody venue with good food (amazing veggie dogs!) and great beer. The owners pride themselves in being a little more family friendly, and it seems that this is True from the crowds I have always seen here. But fear not fellow 20 single somethings: this place can be for you too! There is ample room at the bar to chill with good beers to watch the game, and also bring a group of friends to one of the adjoining tables. If I lived over in the Regent Square/Wilkinsburg area, I would stop in here more often. However, it has become a cool bar that I frequent before/after a movie at the Regent Square Theater. Cheers!",

Then we find out that after we had nicely split the tab for them (even adding in an extra $10 on top of the grat because we were too lazy to re-do the math) that they wouldn't split the check? In the time we argued about it, you could have run the 3 credit cards we had and been done with it.  Had to argue with the manager (who was completely unhelpful, with one of the waiters standing behind her and being rude to me for backup) for 10 minutes and they didn't give us an inch. I would have stiffed the waiter for the awful service if I could have; but we got gratted so I didn't even have that option.  If you want to come here with more than 3 people, avoid D's. Their beer is severely overpriced ($10 for a beer I can get at Sharp Edge for $6? no thanks!) and the food is the same fried garbage covered in cheese you can get at any other bar in Pittsburgh.  In other words, don't come here. I used to like this place, but tonight was such a bad experience I'll just go to one of the other places in Pittsburgh that serves hot dogs, french fries and beer. There are plenty of them, I won't miss D's at all.",

You just have to make your selection and they will open it for you at your table.  You can also create your own mix and match 6 pack to carry out.   Now on to the food.  If you get french fries - I am warning you, the portion is very large.  The ones with bacon and cheese are a great.  We tried both the wet and dry wings and were happy with both.  Now the reason we came here; the hot dogs.  And oh are they amazing.   They have hot dogs combinations on the menu, but you can also create any combination that you want.  I am a HUGE fan of the Chicago Dog - they do it right!!!   On a side note - if you like Root Beer, they have a great root beer on draft.  They do offer a children's menu as well and it is completely fine for children in the middle of the day.  You see tons of families.   The staff has always been very friendly and helpful.

I can't add much in the way of reviews here as to the food here, I think everyone has pretty much hit the nail on the head. The dogs are good, and I am happy they have veggie dogs. Beer selection is amazing.  It's very family friendly, so if that's what you are looking for this is the place for you. Personally, I work with children all day  & love them to death, don't get me wrong... but I find parents here tend to let their children act out a lot, and I find it really distracting and not relaxing. Since I am with children all day, I like my meals to not involve yelling and running children. So to solve that problem, we just order take out and eat our dogs at home!",

It has a large selection of drafts and there is also a back \"room\" where you can buy pretty much any beer that exists either for taking it to your home or for having it with your dinner.  The service was fast and helpful.  I am sure I will be visiting this place again in the future but just do not expect something spectacular.",

Dozens of microbrews that I need to get to know better as well as Guinness, black and tans, and Unibroue Terrible...a 10.5% ABV, 12 oz challice of dark strong flavorful brew.  Pints are $5-8 depening on how obscure a beer you are ordering.  But there is crazy selection.  Try something different.   Did you know, in this town....and I guess in this state, you don't buy your beer in the grocery store?  You gotta go to spots like this for a sixer.  If you need a beer, pint or to-go, this is an effin' cool spot. mix and match a sixer.  We tried a bunch of dogs, wings and beers.    The crew here managed to keep our glasses full even though it was packed on st. patrick's day.  We tried a few dogs: the mac and cheese brat (with bacon)....really! bacon, mac n cheese on an effin' hotdog, a bacon cheddar brat and something called the mason-dixon, which was french fries & coleslaw on a dog.  All the dogs were good eats.  You can get your order vienna, veggie, turkey, cheese brat, or on a spicy dog.  The dogs arrive well grilled with a little bit of crisp blackening going on.  There are a shit load of additional toppings you can request (avacado, bacon, various mustards, saurkraut, etc.) and they seemed to be free...at least we didn't get charged anything additional .....Everything was included in the dog prices.  Wings were ok.  We did dry wings: jerk, spicy ranch, and parmesean.  They were all decently meaty.  The parmeseans with a side of the spicy mayo were good stuff, distinct flavor and good for dipping.  The other flavors of dry wings were ok. Mostly just salty, but ok.",

First of all, the veggie dogs are greasy and don't taste any better than the frozen Morningstar ones you buy at Giant Eagle. Fries are nothing special. And my order has been wrong (either missing a topping or with extra toppings I did not want) every time I've been here. And it's expensive for what it is. Ridiculous to pay $40+ for four hot dogs and soft drinks (no alcohol included).  It's also so loud in the restaurant that it is pointless to even try to talk to your dining companions.  The worst part, though, is the service.  You practically have to beg the waitresses to pay any attention to you. And I don't even mean refilling your drink. I mean to put your order in in the first place, and to pay your bill.   Go to Franktuary. It's a million times better in every way.",

A bit off the beaten path, but an easy bus ride from my Oakland hotel (and bus originates from Downtown, so should be easy ride from there, too).  Ds did not disappoint: creative craft beer list of 25+ taps, plus hundreds of bottles in the Beer Cave that you can have onsite or take to-go, and some of the best dogs I've ever had. Was there on a Friday, so got the Scorpion (cheddar jalapeno kielbasi) & fries deal for $5.50--excellent. Also tried the very good Ds Brat (cheesy bratwurst) & fries (same price), and they do a terrific version of the Chicago Dog. There are also 20+ toppings options if you want to DIY. Nice, friendly service from the guys behind the bar/in the kitchen made this a fine time.  Next time I'm in PGH, Ds will be at the top of my list to visit. Can't wait to try their other dogs and whatever they have on tap (or in the Cave).  P.S. There is also sit-down service in a room between the bar and Cave that seemed more family-friendly. I noticed several tables had pizzas and burgers, so I assume those are decent, too.",

I will say though that I could not go here while I was pregnant...you can smell the delicious beer in the air and the Beer Cave taunted me mercilessly with that which I could not indulge...sigh. That was a tough nine months.  Things I don't like so much...tables too close together and too small. The macaroni and cheese is bland, although you can't ask much for two bucks. There is nothing on their website right now other than the menu. Servers can be a bit brusque or forgetful and not refill your drinks without asking, but it kind of goes with the atmosphere I suppose.

    "text": "UPDATE: July 2013  Went back for a visit to the alma mater and decided to stop in at D's before heading out. I have updates on the gluten-free beer situation and the nacho situation.  GF Beer: MUCH improved from what I remember. They had at least three varieties of the \"deglutenized\" beers - Estrella Damm Daura and both the Amber and Blonde Brunehaut (from Belgium!). They MAY have had Omission as well.  They also have at least three varieties of New Planet, and at least two of Greens. Dogfish Head T'weasonale. Possibly New Grist and Tread Lightly? I was in a haze of deliciously non-gluteny beer at this point.   Nachos: Maybe I'm recalling incorrectly, but I think when I've had these in the past they are made with real cheese - you know, shredded and melted. This time they were served with that nasty-ass liquid cheese goop, like you get at a ballpark. Blegh.   Still four stars overall! Avoid the nachos though.  ---  The only food I've ever had here is nachos, so I can't speak to that. I WILL speak to the beer selection, though! I've managed to collect quite an assortment of beer snob friends, who love spending hours (literally) in the Cave o' Beer. I have to eat gluten free, so most ordinary beers are off-limits for me, BUT, they have an enormous selection of hard cider! Many many different kinds, including my favorite cider in the whole world, JK Scrumpy. Totally reasonable prices, too.  Now the bad: 1. They close at midnight! After the downstairs closes you can take your drink upstairs to a little bar, but it's super loud, has no seating, and you don't have access to the magical treasure trove of beer. Boooo. 2. This is totally a niche thing, but I wish they had a better selection of gluten-free beers. There are lots of tasty ones out there, but they often only have Bards and Redbridge.",

It is also kid friendly as almost every time I am visiting this place there are families with young children enjoying themselves.  The biggest decision is to pick a beer off the draft list which always has a great selection or pick one from in the beer cave. I usually try a draft and then head into the chilled beer cave. There is also a larger section of single beers for purchase in the back that are not cold. If you want to drink them while at the restaurant they have a chiller-so cool!!  My past visit I was impressed by the large selection of pumpkin beers. I tried a bottle called Baked by Lancaster Brewing-tastes just like pumpkin pie!!  To go with it I ventured from my usual Chicago dog and ordered the Angry Tikki-pineapple, bacon and special cheesy, sweet and spicy combo mixture of sauce. I was not disappointed and a great choice. The poppy seed buns they serve the dogs on are the best!",

Ok, I love the veggie dogs on the bun just plain, but I've been rockin' some of the specialty ones lately. I highly recommend the Chihuahua with jalapenos and avocado, or the Mac n' cheese, with...well, mac and cheese. The housemade root beer is also divine. It's perfectly sweet and refreshing.   This isn't diet food people! There are far too many (oh so lovely) temptations at D's. Splurge and get the cheese fries to share. A small is good for 2 or 3 people and perfect with hotdogs.  Once you get a table, sit back, relax and enjoy the goods.You won't regret it.  D's is definitely not a rush-in, rush-out sort of place.",

I had a waitress be pretty rude and passive aggressive- when we walked in 30 minutes before close, she let out a sigh and shook her fists in frustration.

They have a great beer cave and a good selection on draft. When I do come I typically order the chihuahua burger (veggie form). Its the perfect amount of spice kick. Love the cheese fries too!  They do have a kids menu with a decent selection. Ordered my daughter the grilled chicken and applesauce. I was pleasantly surprised by it.  On warmer days they open up the garage door and you get a nice breeze. The place just makes me yearn for summer.",

    "text": "I totally understand a good spot with someone on waitstaff/a cook/ etc having an off day resulting in poor/slow/etc service, but a whole TEAM of people having an off day?  We got to D's around 4:30PM. Ordered waters and all our food at once since we were hungry: a burger with onion rings, a pepperoni pizza,  and some cheese bread. My husband took our toddler outside for a walk, since he was losing his nerve, and right as they stepped out my burger came to the table. Great! Nothing worse than an ornery, hungry, toddler. We all rush back to the table and get ready to eat. A few minutes later the cheese bread comes out, okay, cool. I start in on my burger thinking the pizza for my husband and son is coming ANY minute.   But it doesn't come. And it doesn't come. And it doesn't come. By the time we started to feel a little perturbed about it, I was on the last bite of my burger and my son had eaten through half the onion rings on my plate. My husband was using our appetizer as his meal and closing in on the last piece of two of cheese bread. He decided to get up and see what the ETA was, since no one was really coming round to give us updates, refill water, etc and was told it was coming out in \"five or ten more minutes.\" This is after we had already been waiting about 20+ mins.   Whomever was primarily working FOH followed behind my husband back to the table, apologizing for the wait, and when my husband pointed out that I was already done with my entire meal while he and our hungry kid sat at the table still waiting, the employee then copped an attitude and started in how he can't control the pizza cook times. No duh. You certainly CAN, though: refill our water and check in with us about the status of a major part of our meal so we know what's going on. He then went on to excuse the slow service by saying burgers cook faster than pizza. That, too, is okay but if you know a burger cooks faster why not time it so the burger comes out at the same time as the pizza? I'd much rather wait just as long as the rest of my family for my meal so we can eat together. Timing is important.   The food is consistent. It's good. The service today was AWFUL: staff hanging around chatting while we struggled to get someone's attention for more water, super delayed food, and defensive explanations as to why it was taking so long (he even checked when he put the order in and seemed surprised he had done it 20+ mins ago). I think there will be a bit of a break until our next visit.",

Weird. Anyway, the service was pretty mediocre. I think the food at D's is pretty good but I think the hot dogs are overpriced, I mean $5.60 a hot dog is kind of ridiculous especially when you consider most people are ordering multiple hot dogs and apps/sides. I do recommend the \"Angry Tiki\" dog, it's the best! It'd be nice if they had some multi-dog deals? Definitely a great beer selection though, the cave is impressive.",

The Hot dog list is giant and offers pretty much any hot dog with unlimited toppings for $5.60 and i'm not talking just ketchup and mustard. D's dogs offer everything from Mac and Cheese, chili, avocado, peppers, sriracha slaw etc etc. They also offer an extensive menu of Pizza,Subs,Wings, Burgers and Salads.  Apart from their many beers on tap D's also has a large backroom filled to the brim with over 1000 different types of beer. The beer is separated into different regions of the country/world. This is one of the only places that I have found random imports that are not commonly found at your local distributor. The Beer is a tad pricey but you do get 20% off a take out order when not drinking in.  Overall D's is a great place for friends and families to have a nice bite to eat and a delicious beer while in Pittsburgh.",

Decently priced for the amount of food you get.   I got the veggie fries, big ben veggie dog and the chihuahua veggie dog. The fries had avocado, cheese and ranch on top. They were really crispy and deepfried but the dressings softened them up. The big ben had fries, cheese and slaw. The slaw was a bit too creamy for me but it was a good idea. The chihuahua had avocado, cheese, salsa ans jalapenos. I put the salsa and jalapenos on the side so I could control the level of spice, and I'm glad I did! This was probably my favorite of the three things I ordered.   I have to say my one complaint is just how incredibly messy everything ends up being. I got ranch all over my car keys and made a huge mess of my silverware and the table. Sooooo many sauces. But if you are a bit prepared, or utilize the roll of paper towels they provide at your table, you should be just fine. Definitely coming back!",

However the truth is, most girls like all three. But here's a secret. Most boys do too. Especially this boy. (tosses hair). Hi stud.  What to get: Chicago Dog Why: Because it's really overpriced and who doesn't like giving money away What?: Nah but really though it's a good dog for sure.  So when I'm being charged $6 for what Chicago locals will charge you $3 for (and make better, usually), I'm all ready to give a 3 star review. The wait time was about 10 minutes for my dog (but they said it'd be 20), the place was packed wall to wall with families and drinkers and diners and socialites (if Pitt has socialites) and barflys and kids and did I mention kids, but there was a surprising lack of hot Pittsburgh girls (Pitt has spectacular women!), maybe because hot dogs aren't really a hot girl thing? I have no idea. The crowd was definitely a sausage fest, though. Both literally and figuratively.  Service was okay, I did appreciate that they managed to find me in the mess of people to give it to me. My hot dog, I mean. What did you think I meant. And the decor in here is pretty awesome, from their massive \"beer room\" to their \"grimy bar that isn't really grimy\" look. I think it's a well done place that will appeal to people with sausages (or who love sausages - the kind you bite into without anyone screaming, except vegans perhaps), and I like it.  I do not like the prices at all, but the Chicago dog was so surprisingly enjoyable and well done and good (though not the most \"authentic\" but who needs authentic when it tastes fantastic, really), that although I would rather pay 3-4 than 6 for this thing, I still have to give it a 5 stars because it's too good of a hot dog to give it less.  Be careful getting in and out of the place. The cars on the street outside drive way too fast for such a public and busy area, and between all the drunk people and narrow lanes and parked cars and high speeds with complete idiots who have probably been drinking and are driving through a sea of bar-goers and families trying to get into Ds and other places, accidents could easily happen out here, especially crossing the street.  Speaking of crossing the street, if any boys are reading this and wanna check out my Chicago dog, hmu.",

I didn't, as I've been here before. This time I just wanted 3 hot dogs. I asked for them with spicy brown mustard and onions. It only took a minute, and the waitress brought them to me in a brown paper bag. I paid and left. I was only in the restaurant for less than 5 minutes, total. The hot dogs were plump, and came on a thick bun that had little black poppy seeds. They were very filling, which was good, because they cost approximately $5.00 each, including a 20% tip.

Food is sub-par...seems the busier they are,  the worse the food is.  What a shame.  It used to be my \"go to\" place in the 'Square, where I would take out-of -towners or go after a mountain bike ride in Frick.  Despite the numbers of great beers, I can't justify giving my money to a place that doesn't care about their customers.",

They have plenty of Belgian beers to choose from a bonus in my beer book.  Beers: usually a good variety on tap plus tons of variety if you need to one stop shop and pick some six packs up in the back.   Warning though if it is a busy summer evening you can wait up to one hour for your dog I think this is because they have tiny kitchen behind the bar. So if you're super hungry go early or later or fill up on their beer first.   Also this doesn't really bother me i still ate my food but the guy cooking the food didn't wear gloves and did touch the food with his bare hands often. If you're OCD maybe just get a beer or don't sit at the bar where you can see this. Don't worry he didn't pick anything up off the floor and put it back on plates, i checked. :)",

    "text": "I've been trying to find new and different restaurants recently, and this is one I found:  About the place: - It's small - It's packed and crowded. - Due it's size, they seats near the walls are all awkward and can't be comfortable. - I wouldn't recommend it for big parties unless you organized it with the place ahead of time. - There is free parking outside, but you are going to have trouble finding a space  The food: - NOTHING COMES WITH THE HOT DOGS AND MEALS COME WITH CHIPS. The fries cost more to get as a side. Who ever heard of fries with your burger/dog? Um, apparently everyone except this place. - I got the chili cheese dog, the mac and cheese dog and the chili cheese fries. - The chili cheese fries are very very good and are some of the best I've had. If you like long fries with breading, you'll like these. The large size is indeed a large size and is enough for 2-3 people. - You get one hot dog, and with toppings on it, it will cost $6.50. I get two dogs with toppings at the local Sunoco for $2.22. I could also buy two packs of hot dogs and probably buns from a cheap place for $6.50, so it's not the cheapest. - The hot dog buns are good and have some green or black seeds on it. The hot dogs are just typical size and aren't super fat or foot longs.  The staff: - They are overworked but they are nice. - One of the girls was cooking and had no hair cover, so I could easily see hair going in food. Hope they fix that.  Suggestions for D's: - Please sell curly fries or pretzels! - Stop being cheap. Give fries with your burger/dog and GIVE ME A SIDE WITH MY DOG. - Try to get a bigger place - Lower the prices for hot dogs or give two hot dogs. They have to be making near $6 profit on a $6.50 dog.  Would I go back? Definitely.",

Besides getting bottles to go, you can also drink from any of their many drafts on tap or their individual bottles.  Many are already in a chilled section, but they also have a beer chiller machine that can chill a room temp bottle in like 5 minutes! And they have a huge selection of beers, both imported and local microbrews.  They also have a nice menu with a variety of things, including hot dogs, hamburgers, salads, etc.  Hot dogs are one of their specialties and I'm not a huge hot dog fan but the bratwurst I had with bacon and mac-n-cheese on top was amazing! I also had the fried zucchini appetizer which was cooked perfectly and the sauces were very tasty (marinara and a spicy ranch-like sauce).  I went on a Wednesday evening post-happy hour and was surprised how super crowded it was, so it may be hard to get a table on weekend nights.",

Sure, they have fries, but why not order fries with bacon and cheese on them, plus ranch dressing on the side (You should, by the way - those are the pub fries and they are delicious). You could order a plain hot dog, but why do that when you have a choice of five different kinds of frank, and toppings like the Chihuahua: avocado, salsa, cheese and jalapeno? Plus, your dog (even if it's a turkey dog like mine) might arrive at the table with a little char on it; that to me is the peak of hot dog flavor.  I feel like a restaurant that serves cheese sauce like a food group should have a warning label on the door, but with their sense of humor, the label would say \"Warning: the food inside is damn delicious and best consumed with a great beer.\"",

I sat at the bar to leave the remaining high boys and tables for larger groups.  I was quickly met with a menu and an offer for a beer. The beer list was extensive.  I couldn't partake but I was jealous of those around me.  I was debating between the Big Ben and the Angry Tiki.  I asked the bartender, explaining that it was my first time and that I was deciding between those two unless there was something else he'd recommend.  He said that if it was my first time, I should try their hot dog of the month, a Thankgiving themed concoction.  I said sure.    This thing was composed of a turkey dog, stuffing/dressing, corn, mashed potatoes, gravy, and cranberry sauce on the side.  I liked 80% of it.  All of the component parts were good EXCEPT the turkey dog.  It just lacked the good snap/bite of a standard dog.  Because it was so soft and all of the other textures were soft it was just kinda bleh.  It needed some sort of crunchy textural element.    The cranberry sauce was served on the side and was homemade I think.  It was very tasty.    Fries were good.  Well seasoned.  Service was busily kind and warm (if that makes sense).  I'll definitely return to D's cause I want to have beers and try more dogs.",

    "text": "Geez Louise is it a fun time at D's! Six Pax & Dogz!   Me and a few buddies were hanging out on a Saturday afternoon and decided we wanted get a good bite and grad a few brews while we were at it, so D's is what we went with. I think we made a solid choice! Once we sat at the bar, didn't take long before a nice waiter asked what we were drinking. They had a large selection of beers on-tap, and tons of IPAs as well.   Now, getting to the phenomenal part of our trip, the DOGZ! I was feeling rather hungry this day so I got 2 dogz. I went with the Roethlisberger, which included coleslaw, french fries and cheese sauce. Unbelievable. For my 2nd Dog, I got the chili cheese with dijon mustard and grilled onions. Both I got with the K-Boss option, which is the kielbasa. Let me just say, these dogz were on point! The bun was fresh and soft, the kielbasa had just enough snap to it, and well the toppings.. the toppings were what brought these bad boys to life! Each bite left your mouth watering for more. Plus their daily deals are sweet and cheap!  This place was the perfect chill settings, all the staff and waiters were friendly, nice and chatty (in a good way) that was welcoming. Plus, they let us taste samples of the beers. If your in the area, highly recommend you stop by D's Six Pax & Dogs, get you a weeny and enjoy the vibez!",

    "text": "A friend of mine recommended D's as he said it's he and his girlfriend's go-to chill spot to enjoy a nice, cold beer. I'm so glad I finally stopped by, because this place is definitely a new favorite of mine. D's is a little divey, but has a charming simplicity being that the menu is centralized around hot dogs and beer, and it doesn't get much better than that!  I started with a Bronx Summer Pale Ale while my boyfriend and I waited on another guest. Their list of beers was decently sized and decently priced. I think my beer was somewhere around $6, which is standard in the city. This place scored major points for having veg friendly options including their veggie dogs, which was what I opted for \"Big Ben\" style. It was a close call between the Big Ben and the Hot Valentine, but the Big Ben won me over with toppings that included a hefty portion of slaw, cheese sauce, fries, and grilled onions that I added. The Hot Valentine will be my choice next time, and that one has sweet potato fries and sriracha slaw as toppings. Every topping was generously portioned on my dog, and it tasted even more wonderful than it looked in that fluffy poppy seed bun.  The daily specials at D's are something to consider, and the one my boyfriend seemed to be most excited about was the $5 burger night on Sundays from 5 to close. I'm not much of a burger eater, but this is a good deal. On another day, Wednesday if I'm not mistaken, they have any style hot dog with fries for $6. Other specials include wings, pizza, kielbasa, brats, hot sausages, etc on different nights of the week. All of them sound like they're worth trying! On the topic of specials, they also feature a monthly special style of hot dog. This month was a Yankee dog with baked beans, potato chips, and I think cheese on top. Baked beans on hot dogs is an amazing creation, and my boyfriend even mentioned coming back monthly to make sure we try their special dog.  Only thing I would make note of is that it can be pricy to build your own 6 pack at around $4 or more per beer, but they have a massive selection of beers in the beer cave. To any friends that are looking for a solid cheat meal or even just a good, tasty treat that won't break the bank, come to D's and they've got you covered! I'm definitely looking forward to coming back.",

They have daily specials plus happy hour from 5-7. My favorite part about D's is their rotating beer list and the beer cave in the back. My least favorite part is the staff. It seems they have a high turnover of staff because I hardly ever get the same waiter twice. Multiple times I've gone and either it takes forever to order or our drinks take forever to come. On my most recent visit, my husband got his food before we got our drinks and I had to ask for the drinks. You can use Yelp to join the waitlist, which I recommend if you're going around noon or during happy hour. They don't have a lot but it's usually easy to find parking out front or on Sanders street.",

    "text": "this place is a local hidden gem! who would've guessed that an unassuming tucked away beer cave would serve deliciously creative hot dogs?  it definitely feels off to shell out over $5 on a hot dog. but these hot dogs are worth it - they're cooked well with just the right amount of juicy snap, the buns are fluffy, and they hold up the mountain of (unlimited) toppings you add, so feel free to order to your heart's content! I ordered Angry Tiki style (bacon, pineapple, double dip, hoisin) which provided the perfect amount of savory and sweet and adding sriracha slaw gave it much needed crunch. one hot dog plus a shared serving of french fries was plenty!  the waitstaff was extremely friendly throughout, accommodating our group of 10 and giving thoughtful suggestions on the beer selection and hot dog toppings! it's a wonderful place for a casual meal with friends!",

They have outdoor seating in the summer and they are located in a great little part of Regent Square.  BUT THERE IS MORE.  This place has one of the best beer selections in all of Pittsburgh. Their Belgian beer selection is off the charts.  They give a 20% discount on all carry out beer and you can walk back to the \"beer cave\" and select any beer you want to drink at the bar.

We lived in San Francisco for several years, and this place also reminds us a bit of some of our old haunts in the Mission. :)  In the summer, they open up the garage style windows, so this is a perfect spot to sit, sip beer (skip the wine though-- its not great) and work on your laptop or newspaper. If you are not into sports and just wanna chill, D's has two sides, so you don't have to feel outnumbered by screaming Steelers fans.  D's always has a nice mix of people as well- from young couples with kids, students, hipsters, to elderly folks. The staff is really nice and friendly and the large mural of local Pittsburgh celebs is pretty neat as well!  Yeah, this place is one of the best, laid back spots here.  I am in love with the FRIES! I know I said this once, but they seriously do something very special to them that I cannot figure out.",

The bun is steamed and features the quintessential poppy seed exterior.  D's beer selection is also great but I'm not much of a beer drinker so it's not something I've ever focused on. The general consensus I've heard is that there is better selection elsewhere and the prices are a little high but you can't beat both their hot dogs and their beer selection at the same time, making them a great bar.  Their fries are so crispy that I suspect they're double fried. They're tasty and the toppings available can turn them into a bastard concoction of delicious, artery clogging glory. There's been nothing on D's menu that I've been disappointed with.  The service can be a little hit or miss due mostly to the sheer amount of business they do on a Friday or Saturday night.",

They have Arsenal Cider, which makes me very happy (although I wish they carried the Bone-Dry).   The hot dogs and fries are amazing. I had an Angry Tiki. It sounded like an odd combination - pineapple, hoisin sauce, and bacon on a hot dog - but it was delicious. The only thing I might change next time is asking for a side of Sriracha (would have put this hot dog over the top).   It's cheap, it's a good set-up for going with a group, and I will definitely take any of my beer-loving friends here.",

Normally I enjoy fishing around the plentiful selection of booze. A hair of the dog was not gonna happen that hangover Sunday. I stuck to shoveling high calorie food into my gullet instead.  The last time I was here I selected from the hot dog menu, and they weren't that great. How can you mess up a frank you may be wondering?  I can only guess that it's the dogs themselves or the way they are prepared. They're kinda chewy. Dormont dogs rallies but the best Dog I've had was at Dirty Franks in Cbus OH. The chili cheese fries are good though. So today I made sure to get my fries fix in and try a burger. This weekend I had burgers on the brain! My BF and I got the Balboa, the BBQ Texas, and two dogs, mac n' cheese and Mason Dixon with with cheese.  The burgers had really delish toppings but the meat was so dry. It was overcooked and did not have one bit of juicyness dripping down my hand. Missing that major component they were truly lackluster. The macaroni dog wasn't that great either. Mac n' cheese should be creamy, salty, buttery. So sorry but this weenie came up flat too. I did like the Mason Dixon! The crunchy-ness of the coleslaw made a huge difference but the meat was still chewy and too salty. Could it be that I am too picky when it comes to my meat? If I am shopping for picnic eats I do go for Smith hot dogs WITH the casing or the large sized Hebrew Nationals. Now those are the mouthwatering crowd pleasers I'm talkin' about!",

A lengthy review of a place that relies entirely on beer and hot dogs would be redundant, so I'll keep this short. Great atmosphere, Decent enough staff, Fair prices, BEST beer list anywhere I've ever been!  If they don't have something you want on draft chances are you can find it in their beer cave.  And the hot dogs and fries are always atop the City's Best. If that isn't enough to get you stop by D's then you're missing the point and probably shouldn't anyhow.",

I had the Cuban dog (pretty terrific) and sweet potato fries. one small order could probably feed 2-3 people...good to know for next time. the beer selection was super. I've been looking for barleywine style ales in this area and most places I've tried haven't even known what I was asking for. these guys were able to help me put together a cool sampler of a few different kinds to take home and try. this was a great visit and D's will definitely be on my beer and food radar in the future. also loved the open air bistro feel for summer. the price seemed a little high for hot dogs but the dogs were really tasty and after it was all said and done, I feel like the value of the hospitality, the good food, and the atmosphere were well worth it.",

Extpect a long wait on weekends for sure!   D's is a comfortable place to go for me and attracts a young-ish crowd but not to young. The atmosphere is lively and casual.  Service can be slow but the servers are always friendly. Overall this is a good casual food place. The walk-in beer cooler and additional beer selection are a draw as well.   They do have some vegetarian options as well, which I always appreciate.",

Every hot dog or hamburger on their menu can be ordered vegetarian, which is both awesome and rare.  I ordered the Chihuahua (with avocado, cheddar cheese, salsa, and jalapenos) and my table split an order of fries.  SO GOOD.  Almost too good.  And you have to take a stroll around the beer cave.  It's not quite as impressive as I was hoping, but definitely worth the splurge to make your own 6-pack.  Last time I was in, I was able to purchase a 6-pack of porters - Anchor, Road Dog, Saranac caramel, Duck-Rabbit, Old Leghumper, and something else I can't remember - for a friend.  I'll definitely go back.",

    "text": "Generally, I like D's I. The restaurant itself has a cozy feel to it, and their large beer cave is one of the few places where I can get some of my favorite import beer.  Note, the Czechs make more than just Pilsner Urquell. Je to pravda! Most of the staff are very friendly, and the managers are always quick to help if you need assistance.    Some of you may get angry with me, but I simply cannot review D's I without comparatively rating it against its sister restaurant, D's II in Monroeville.  And no, I couldn't possibly care less that the latter is in an old Pizza Hut.  That's right, I prefer D's II to D's I. Hear me out.    First of all, D's I' drafts are all about a dollar more expensive than those in the suburbs.  Why the upcharge?   Also, after being spoiled by the very large menu selection at D's II, I'm always a little disappointed when dining at Regent Square.  No wraps, no steak salad, no variety of sandwiches.  I will say that the food they do serve is good.  I enjoy their pizza and their daily hummus offering.    D's I has a much smaller draft selection and lacks a full bar.  Fine.  It's a smaller location and it stays True to its original \"beer bar\" theme.  Sometimes, however, I like to mix it up.  And I can do that more easily at the Monroeville location.  Obviously, I's beer cave trumps II's beer... um... outcove?   So all of that warrants a four-star rating.  Why the three? Like its suburban counterpart, I'm docking a star for closing so early.  Even when there is a crowd, the staff closes at 11:00 (Su-W) or 12:00 (Th-Sat) on the DOT.  That's just not responding to demand!  Overall, I don't dislike D's I.  Quite the contrary.  After all, three stars means \"A-OK.\"  But to me, D's Regent Square doesn't go beyond that.",

Of course, those near and far are drawn to its extensive draft list, infamous beer cave, intriguing mural, and the mighty beer chiller. Just an aside...D's has been doin' da damn thang a long ass time...aeons before lots of craft beer under one roof + good food was chic in this town. Respect. Yes, it's standard bar fare, but they do it quite well really...the daily specials are money and Wednesday's O.G. dog 'n fries for a scant $6 is my go-to. Choose from a signature recipe dog or BYOD with toppings galore to choose from. Beware of their beer battered fries -- doesn't matter if you order them or not, you'll still smell like a deep fryer when you leave so you might as well get 'em and I bet you can't eat just one! Dogs not your thing? No prob! There's always pizza, sammies, and wings (oh my!) to fill your tummy. Service has always been friendly 'n fast and it's kid friendly. So be a good neighbor, come to D's...where everybody is your buddy.",

    "text": "D's famous, expansive Beer Cave brought us here by necessity being that Kay and I were throwing a housewarming party the next day and required some alcohol for our guests. We didn't walk out with any booze thanks to an honest employee who directed us to a cheaper beer distributor down the street, but dine on some fabulous franks we did.   Hey, we had enough cooking to do in the morning, and since D's serves food...  Resisting the urge to destroy burgers wherever I see them listed, I opted to take on a duo of dogs as did Kay: A Chicago and a Bacon Cheddar. Kay stayed True to her Southern roots and went for a Mason Dixon (a slaw 'n chili dawg) and a Mac 'n Cheese (yup its on there), neither of which I got to try.  The Chicago is just that; relish, onions, pickles, tomatoes, sport peppers, yellow mustard, and celery salt on my choice of a Vienna All-Beef frank, all of it contained in a mattress of a poppyseed bun.   If THIS was an \"authentic\" Chi-town style hot dog, then Chicagoans are more blessed than they know.   What I couldn't fathom was not only how the folks in the kitchen got all of the components inside a bun but also how they did it in such a picturesque manner. It was so aesthetic, I was afraid to munch on it.  From there, I got down 'n dirty with the Bacon and Cheddar and found that the molten orange goo almost usurped the beefy, salty flavors of the grade-A proteins, taking the bread with it down to the bottom of a sea of cheese Primus would avoid.   Coming back to Chicago from Yuba City (I kid my uncle's hometown), I found that this regional take came off more like a sandwich, transcending its genre so to speak. Fresh tomato cuts stood where ketchup should not. Sport peppers livened up the affair like GG Allin. A literally neon-green freakshow of a relish acted as a feather boa as well as a sugared counterweight to the briny proceedings. Dill pickles added more sass and bite as well as chill, and the yellow mustard/onion tandem had a bit to say about tradition. Archetypal, the majestic franks within each sheath of bread, but particularly the Chicago, were mountains above ballpark or arena fare. The flavors of slain, ground, smoked, grilled bovine were ALL you tasted upon breakage of the natural casings, and no amount of topping could smother or deny them. Note that I said the cheddar on the former dog was ALMOST overwhelmed. Not even Cheeze Whiz can kill wieners (stop...snarking...stop it!) like these.   A \"handful,\" as D's calls it, of french fries were beer-battered and superlative in every crisped, aurulent way frites can, should, and must be. The BBQ wings had a sauce that was stickysweet like a certain Def Leppard hit and fell apart in our hands and in our mouths. Come, come ye wing fanatics.   Another valid reason for D's to be is its energetic, far from obnoxious, live-and-let-live atmosphere that few places can match let alone top. People we absolutely did not know came up to us, asking us how we liked the food, if we had been to D's before, how our night was going, and etcetera, glorious etcetera. We dined underneath a whimsical painted mural full of famous people and fictional characters. While awaiting our meal, we spotted Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Spider-Man, Bill Cardille, Richard Pryor, Bruno Sammartino, Captain America, and we'll leave it at that so as not to spoil your time-killing, conversation-making fun.   Regent Square is fortunate to have D's. Come on a Friday night, grab a seat, have a frank, sip a cold beverage, and allow your weekday worries to disappear.",

The atmosphere is very chill, and the servers just wait on whoever needs help, which is cool. I am not a beer drinker but the beer cave is so impressive! I'm sure I could have found something special but wasn't in a browsing mood. Another thing, when I heard \"dogs\" I thought great - not veg friendly! But mistaken! They had tons of veg options! Not only veggie dogs are offered, but they have a great hummus platter, salads and more! I LOVED the hummus... so tasty! All in all, a great experience! I would love to come back and watch a daytime game here and grab a tasty bite!",

Nachos were with the round yellow bag chips, plus some cheese sauce, and a spattering of jalapenos.  The Chicken Supreme Sandwich was kind of boring, but filling.

I liked the small, personal feel to the old place, but it definitely limited how many people who could be in the shop at a time.  So, now they have a much more extended seating area with a bar area and a back room devoted to brews.  I brought my friends here who like beer, and they were ecstatic to find a fave beer that they haven't been able to find anywhere in the DC area.  (Go Pittsburgh!).  The selection is nice and its good to see that I can find those out of the way beers so that I don't have to get just the norm from a beer distributor.    The hot dogs?  None of us were gushing about them afterward.  But they're ok.  4 stars for the beer selection.",

The beer cave is to die for (though I find it hard to believe there are 1,000 beers in there) and stocks some pretty hard to find brews. I love that you can make your own six pack-- a great way to try a variety of beers without having to take the risk of hardcore commitment. There is a smaller refrigerated section at the front of the cave too, which is nice. What I really appreciate is that D's serves veggie dogs (a pretty uncommon find) that are pretty tasty! I quickly became smitten with their veggie Chihuaha dogs. I've also tried their nachos which were good (wiz, not shredded cheese). Great for takeout and dining in alike.",

What lured me was the promise of veggie dogs and burgers, and I was not let down. I got two hot dogs--a Chicago and a mac and cheese. Really, really good. My boyfriend ordered the Red Alert dog (his was meat) and his face basically melted off, but he insisted he loved it. Then he said the spices may or may not have traveled to his tear ducts, but to each his own. He had a great time. My two friends also got the mac and cheese veggie dog and loved it.  The beer cave is awesome.  I'd love to give D's five stars, but like a couple of people mentioned, the service is lacking. Everyone is friendly, but I had to walk around and find our server so I could pay, and then find him again when he didn't return. It took us a while to get water refills, too. The dining area and the bar are separated, and it seems like the servers congregate in one place and leave the other vacant at any given time. Very nice people though.",

The BF ate here once last year and loved it so much that we decided that we needed to make it our first stop on our road trip to Minnesota. We planned our departure time so that we could get here at lunch (it was a mere 7 hour drive!)  We both ordered the Bacon Cheese all beef dog (hot dog with bacon and melted cheddar on top) plus a corn dog, dusted wings and two root beers. We didn't try any of the beers on tap since we still had a lot of driving ahead of us. The Bacon Cheese was ridiculously good and I wished that I could have finished it. Unfortunately I hogged pretty much all of the corn dog since it was AMAZING!!!  The wings were also really good, maybe even among the top three chicken wings that we had the whole trip. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in the Pittsburgh area or anyone who is crazy enough to drive 7 hours for a hot dog.",

It has expanded in the past couple years, moved the beer around and now they keep most bottles in a walk in beer cooler. They also have a rotating selection of draft beers. They still have a beer cave in the back.   The beer selection is quite good. The service can be both good and bad, depending on the server you get. The place is very relaxed. The food isn't particularly memorable. I enjoy the fish sandwih. Fries are good. It's great for groups. It can get quite busy.",

    "text": "Everyone else has talked up the humongous beer selection, so I won't belabor the point.  You can always find the old favorites, as well as literally hundreds of things you've never tried or even heard of before.  Plus, they have a wide and rotating draft selection.  (By the way, unless you're one of those people who needs to see the label turn blue, most of the beers in the non-cold room are plenty cold enough to drink as it is.  It's the beer *cave*, not the beer *greenhouse*, after all.)  The menu has expanded recently, but the hot dogs are still the best part.  (A close second is the sausage sandwiches...)  The chili cheese fries will clog the hell out of your arteries, but you *will* like it.  The mural opposite the bar (see one of the profile pictures) sometimes reads like a term paper on the history and varieties of beers, but it still makes this place the most educational bar (on any subject other than anatomy, anyway) in Pittsburgh.  The mural in the other room, depicting a wide variety of local and global celebrities, is pretty entertaining, too.  Not really good for groups---while they'll be happy to have you, finding seating for all of you is likely to be complicated.  Plenty of food to please the age-inappropriate among you, and they've even got a quite good root beer on draft.  If they've got liquor under the bar somewhere, I've never seen it, but they've usually got a couple bottles of house wine open.  (But what did you expect?  It's a beer bar.)",

Their main fare is hot dogs with a wide variety of toppings, but their menu also includes other standard bar foods like Pizza, calzones, hoagies, etc.    But let's be honest, while the food is good, when D's comes up in conversation it is unlikely because you are raving about the \"chicago dog\" you had there last night: D's is widely recognize as the location of the \"beer cave\", a massive collection of beers from around the country and even around the world.  Everything from little-known microbrews to fairly exotic imports like Delirium Tremens (the variety comes from the fact that they are owned by the same people as the nearby McBrooms beer distributor, I have been told).      A group of us grad students goes there every thursday night, so say hello if you're there.  An added bonus is that the \"new\" side of the restaurant is already smoke free.",

There are other things on the menu but the stars of the show are in the name.  So let's talk dogs first.  Each one is going to cost you $4-$5 and they are large, delicious and messy.  You definitely want to be among friends when you eat one of these bad boys and have plenty of napkins.  If you are only eating dogs, many folks order two.  Every topping imaginable is available.  Another popular choice is one dog and excellent fries.  Add a craft beer or two and you have one heck of a fine casual meal.  Speaking of craft beers, the selection here is excellent.  I appreciate that the names are up on an easy to read board that includes the ABV%.  If you are new to craft beers, many of them are very strong.  Let's say you normally drink three or four Coors Lights and now you are discovering the pleasure of Delirium Noel.  It's a 10% beer and if you drink three or four you are in for a big surprise!  In the interest of safe driving for everyone, be aware of the ABV%.  So the food is great and the beer is excellent and I've found the service to also be right on.  These folks are extremely popular so at peak times it's mobbed.  Do yourself a favor and show up off peak and you'll eat and drink much more quickly.",

    "text": "If you're like me, you probably enjoy watching people eat hot dogs and will want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh.   What? I can't be the only one. Seriously? Fine. Then excuuuUUUuuuse me. I'll rephrase for the supposed masses.  If you enjoy eating hot dogs, you'll want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. It's a great place to go and get some tubed meat in a variety of different mix and match combinations and also a great place to meet new people... perhaps you'll even meet someone who shares your love of you eating hot dogs and you can shower them with many moments of which they can watch you eat your beloved wieners and y'all can live happily ever after.   No? Ugh, fine. Then just eat the damn hot dog all by your lonesome. See if I care.  I came in with a group of friends for a semi-liquid lunch and though it was the beer cave that brought us in, I was secretly more excited about watching my friends eat hot dogs. You see, I'd been feeling super sick for the entire duration on my Pittsburgh road trip. I think it was a bad Cholera strain. Anyway, my party of six allowed me to sleep in extra late while they wandered around some graveyard by our hotel with scones until I was all puked out and ready see what the light of day looks like. I was feeling bummed that I had to hibernate through my original morning plan of going to the zoo, but the thought getting to see my pals suck down chili dogs all Jack & Diane style really helped lift my spirits.  We walked in, sat down and I was immediately excited to be sitting across from their epic celebrity mural. It's like a pop-culture/history 'Where's Waldo', only there's no Waldo, and instead Gandalf, Wolverine, John Candy, and more. I spent the entire time between ordering and the food coming out staring at the wall and finding new peeps. My only gripe on the artwork is that the mural was seriously lacking in Bill Murray biz-nasty, so for that I have to subtract a star. Okay, no. I'm only (half) joking about the star thing. I'm actually deducting the star because their veggie dog was pretty damn terrible. I mean, the toppings (I got the chihuahua with cheese and jalapenos) were fine, but I think I've microwaved dogs that tasted better than theirs. It was so freaking rubbery and tough and chewy... like bad calamari or trying to chew a whole pack of rock hard Bazooka Joe at once. My jaw was tired from trying to force my tearing teeth into that little soy sausage but the worst part is that I had to devote so much extra time to eating my stupid wiener that I missed being able to watch my friends eat their hot dogs. Boo-urns. Next time, I'll skip the veggie dog and go with a wrap or pizza or burger or something that'll allow for more wiener-peeping.  On the other hand, the veggie pub fries were damn good and something I resented having to offer to share them with my friends... but I did offer because I felt like it would detract from them getting 'weirded out' at my wanting to gawk at them like I bought a ticket to watch them eat hot dogs... even though that wishful thought didn't pan out anyway thanks to the lackluster veg-dog I ended up with.   Their beer selection was stellar and their beer cave in back was a fun shopping experience and great place to find a few rarities. They actually had the Rogue Voodoo Doughnut bombers that you can hardly ever find. Unfortunately, my sickness impaired me from imbibing and I actually spent the latter half of the time there barfing in the bathroom (not to the fault of D's) while my friends shopped for a bevy of beer in the cave. Also worth mentioning is how friendly everyone here was. Lots of helpful staff members and even the other ladies in the bathroom who were concerned with my hurling to the point where they wouldn't leave me alone and I had to lie and say that it was no big deal, I was in my first trimester and the morning sickness was getting the best of me. Very nice people those Pittsburgh folk are.",

There was a giant mural on the wall to the left of our table with just about every iconic figure from Kermit the Frog, to Einstein really it was a sight to see. My little sister, little bro and I had a blast playing where's Waldo, while we waited for our order's to be taken. The  decor and wall murals were about the most interesting thing about our dining experience.  For a meal for 3 people I spent $50 ouch that's a little high for a hotdog shop and something I wasn't expecting such a high bill.  The kiddies did enjoy their meals, we got cheese and chili fries, a mason Dixon dog, a red alert dog,  two beef dogs with mustard and ketchup, two drafts of pumpkin ale(for me) and a Philly cheese steak.   The dogs are  bigger than average, but the chili tasted like your standard chili from a can, I was hoping that with the price tag of $5.00 a dog the chili would have more character.   My little bro proclaimed at the end of his meal, \"I'm full, I've never  been full off of two hotdogs!\"  I'll do anything to put a smile on kids face, even though the food fell flat, the restaurant was fun and we smiled laughed and jokes through a rather mediocre meal.",

They have a variety of beer, they have a room all the way in the back with lots of different beer and a separate room displaying other kinds of beer.  They also have outdoor seating.  It's like 2 shops next to each other separated by a hall way.  I didn't even know there was a spot next door until I went to the restroom.  The fries are good. They offer pizza and other goodies too. They have many types of different types of dogs.  I had the veggie red alert which is spicy.  They have 3 kinds of hot dogs so it caters even to the vegetarian.  Regular dog, beef dog and veggie dog.  You have unlimited toppings - mushrooms, onions, creamy avocado etc.  The dog came in this little boat sized paper tray.  I find it very hard to eat because all of the toppings would fall off to the table, but they do have paper towels for you to put underneath if you want to do this so you can eat whatever falls off.  The veggie dog tasted like the real thing.  They also have dogs of the day.   Quite an interesting place but worth the visit in a little town.",

We were seated immediately and our server was quick to greet us. My boyfriend and I each ordered a draft beer. He had an IPA by Sierra Nevada and I had the Boulder Shake Chocolate Porter. Both were awesome and their draft list is decent. About 15-20 craft beers on tap.   We each ordered a sandwich. Their menu wasn't large but they had more than just your typical bar food, definitely more interesting items. I got a chicken sandwich named the chihuahua--chicken, avocado, cheddar cheese, salsa and jalapenos. It was amazing! Their sandwiches automatically come with chips (which I'm never a fan of) but I was able to substitute them for French fries. Their fries were amazing, they were the kind that are battered and those are my favorite (very few places around the burgh sell them like that) so this was very exciting to me. Overall the price isn't bad either which was awesome. After dinner my boyfriend and I both go my 6 packs to go.. They have an awesome selection.. Over 1,000 beers in their beer room (all beers are warm) but they do also have a cooler which has less beers but still not a bad selection.   I honestly couldn't be happier with my experience.",

    "text": "D's has been hovering among my Pittsburgh bookmarks for a couple of years now, so I was happy to finally stop by for a visit and late lunch recently. After squeezing into a parallel parking spot out front, I had two things on my mind when walking in here: hotdogs and beer, both of which they have down pat.  Since it was mid-afternoon, few tables were filled, but the front patio was open to allow in some fresh air during the nice day. I first looked around at their extensive beer selections; \"six pax\" in the rear \"Beer Cave\" and individual bottles in the middle cooler. I found something to my liking and grabbed a high table and menu.  A \"Big Ben\" dog sounded appetizing (and mildly appropriate), but I ended up going with the \"Mason Dixon\" topped with chili and coleslaw. Knowing that one dog would not be enough, I also went with a small order of their \"Pub Fries\" covered in cheese and bacon. (Forgive me Father, for I have no restraint.)  Holy Moley! Both the dog and fries were excellent and down right tasty. Thank God because my satisfied stomach was smacking down the guilty part of my brain that was subconsciously calculating the summation of calories shared between the meal and two bottles of liquid refreshment.  Oh well. I definitely heart D's, even if my heart now hates me in return. 4.5 Stars.",

Everyone talked about it like it was the greatest place in existence. I had such high expectations!   I suppose maybe I was expecting too much, which led to some disappointment. A few friends and I went here on a Friday night and it was (predictably) packed. We were fairly lucky to get a table almost right away.   I obviously had to acknowledge that the beer selection is impressive. If you can't find it here, you probably can't find it anywhere in Pittsburgh. I had to check out the famous \"Beer Cave\" which seemed to have just about everything. I think I'll make it a point to pick up some brews here next time I'm looking for something unusual or new.  I wish I had more to say, but I just wasn't feeling it. My friends love it so I'm sure I'll be back, and next time I'll make it a point to try the food. Judging by some of the other reviews, that might change my perception of the place.",

I really love that you can walk back into the beer cave and pick out your beer, and they offer cool chillers for it.  Here's the best hike in Pittsburgh:  Hike in Frick Park.  take the Falls Ravine trail until you come out near the bridge.  Walk across the bridge.  At Ryan's Pub, turn right and walk straight ofr awhile.  You'll come to D's Six Pack and Dogs.  You will be READY for a beer, bc its a hike.  But that is the point of hiking.  Eat delicious food and drink beer.  Call a friend to come pick you up and take you home.  The End.  In fact, its a damn shame they dont offer a gift registry.  Because I would register for beer.  I would.  No judgement.",

The hot dogs looked delicious, and my friends are real beer fans, so we thought it'd be perfect.  It was better than expected.    First, obviously, the beer selection is amazing. You can either order off their menu, choose a beer from their walk-in fridge, or venture back into the Beer Cave (where they've got every beer ever) and throw a bottle or too in the chiller.  Five minutes later, the beer's cold and delicious. We all took advantage of this, and picked up six packs on the way out.    Second, the hot dogs were really good. I definitely recommend the Angry Tiki dog.  Sweet, spicy and really delicious.   The only thing is they don't handle groups well. There's plenty of room, but once we'd already split up our check amongst everyone's credit card, we were told they don't usually do that for more than 6 people.  The guy did it for us anyway, but it took awhile, and I'm still not really sure who got charged for what.  If you're in the area, or even almost in the area, make a trip to D's. It's definitely worth it.",

I ordered a custom dog with Philly Cheesesteak toppings. The ticket time on our food was a tiny bit long but it was a busy day and they checked on us several times to offer refills in our beers. The food came out hot and fresh which is a nod to the fact that they actually were busy and made it when they could...not as if it had been sitting under a hear lamp somewhere.  If you're a hotdog enthusiast, you probably have the same benchmarks for a good dog as I do.  I'm pleased to say that the bun was soft and fresh and the dog had  a ton of flavor and that perfect snap as you bite in to it.  The toppings didn't take away from or mask the flavors of the all beef dog,  but added to the flavor party going on on that poppy seed bun. Their fries are also a must. Never have I had such a crispy fry.  Dining at D's was a great experience and I recommend it to anyone wanting a casual meal with great menu choices.",

The food is really good too! Wings, dogs, veggie dogs...these aren't just your typical ballpark quality dogs. Nah, these are amazing. The buns, the all beef dog with that welcome \"snap\" when you bite it...yum. Plus the selection of options will keep you coming back to try more and more. The daily specials are worth watching - the 10 wings for $5 on Monday is a bargain!!  Since they don't serve cheapo food or beer, the price reflects that. 2 draft beers and 2 hotdogs  is close to $25. But hey, enjoy it. The crowd is cool, the atmosphere is terrific, and the beer selection is among the best in the city. I'll keep coming back. For sure!",

    "text": "Our favorite dive bar in Pittsburgh. Set on the quaint Neighborhood of regent square you can usually find a table pretty easily and at most have 30 minute wait during peak times.  Fast friendly service with the best hot dogs and beers on tap in town. Their beer cave is so much fun (over 1000 beers) and if you buy to go you get $1 off each beer. I've come shopping in the cave for presents for beer lovers.  Lastly this is a vegetarian haven. they have veggie dogs and burgers with the most creative and delicious toppings. My go to is the veggie dog with the angry tiki (hoison sauce with pineapple, I skip the bacon) on a poppy seed bun.  Fries are also epic- usually a handful of fries is enough for two to share. We love them so much we have gotten takeout of just fries before!  Staff are always friendly despite the busy and controlled chaos.",

If you're looking for a Mac n cheese dog or one with bacon and pineapple with sriracha and a side of chili cheese fries, they've got you covered too. Add in an enormous draft selection, a beer cave 1000 beers deep, and just the right game always on, and you've got my choice for a Saturday evening.   Not to mention pizza for days, innovative burgers that'll blow your socks off, and CORNDOGS. Just go here be happy.",

However, check the price of a beer before you buy it. Some of their selections are not well marked, and I accidentally drank a $15 12oz beer and didn't learn of it till I got my bill (it was mixed in with some $5 beers from the same brewery).   The  Chicago style hot dog I got was good. But not $6 for 1 standard size dog good.   So I walked out of there paying $28 (tip included) for 1 beer, 1 hot dog and a handful of fries. Not a good value in my book. Probably won't be back.",

Staff was very nice and our server was fairly attentive to the table.  After our meal we ventured into the beer cave.  I pieced together a 6pack of various craft brews (all which were $1 if you are packing them to go) to take home.  Plenty of great offerings in the beer cave..almost everyone of my favorites were available.  Bad:  The place was pretty busy and didn't seem well organized.  If you're waiting for a table there's not really any place to stand while you wait.  Our server was often distracted and stopped in the middle of our order to talk with another server.  The layout isn't the greatest and staff often walked by and knocked into my chair as I ate.  When I rang out (I don't think they take your bill up...ours was presented and our server never came back?) the girl at the front started to ring up another couple behind me before I grabbed my 6 pack off the counter.  Verdict:  Again, everyone was super nice...maybe I just caught them on an off night and everyone was frazzled.  Either way..the food was good, the prices were good, and the people were cool.  I'll gladly go back if given the chance.",

It's tasty, and the beer selection is impressive, but the experience hadn't quite knocked my socks off until last night.   My husband ordered some to-go food to eat while we were at the nearby The Loft bar. He ordered the Mac'N Cheese hot dog with Fries. The hot dog was incredible! The mac and cheese was so delicious that I asked one of The Loft's bartenders for a fork to finish off the 1/2 cup of mac and cheese that had fallen off the bun and was laying sadly in the styrofoam box. I wasn't wasting a bite of that deliciousness. The fries were really tasty, too -- super crispy and perfectly seasoned.  Based on my overall experience at D's, I still rate this place 3 stars. However, if I have a few more of the Mac'N Cheese hot dog and Fries combinations, I may be quickly updating my review!",

The dogs were tasty and they had some interesting recipes but let's cut to the chase....  the beer selection is massive!   Being from Michigan, we are spoiled with craft beers from our fine state, but with that comes the desire to try other state's craft beer selection and D's had a solid selection of PA brews.    For one, the beer cooler had a good sized selection, but it's all about the hundreds of warm beers they have in the back of the restaurant.  They have pretty much anything you want back there and it doesn't' matter that it's warm because they have a beer chiller where you can put your beers in there until optimal temperature.   It only takes about 7 minutes and they are good to go as well.    Needless to say, this is another recommendation that I will pass on to all friends heading to Pittsburgh.  I'll spare the beer reviews as there's another app for that.",

Craving a hot dog, I found D's on Yelp and figured I would give it a try.    I was intrigued by the specials menu so I started with an order of wings and Buffalo wing hummus.  This Buffalo girl was pleased.  The wings were tasty and done perfectly.  And the hummus was so good I wanted to ask for the recipe.    The flavor combinations of the hot dogs were crazy.  Who would ever think of putting pineapples and bacon on a hot dog?  Well, I'm glad they did.  It was an interesting mix of flavors and was very satisfying.  If I hadn't also tried the wings and hummus, I would have tried at least two other hot dog creations.  Aside from the creations on the menu, you are also able to customize your own creation.  There is also a \"beer cave\" that I can't review since I didn't try any, but it looks impressive.  I eagerly await my next trip to D's!",

The place can get kind of loud at night so make sure your group of friends aren't hard of hearing. The craft beer selection is excellent. You can make your own six pack to go or drink any one of the unique beers in-house. They also have beers on tap for a cheap price. Food wise, their wings are decent and the pizza is greasy and cheesy. The place is pretty bare bones 'burgh style. Not trying to be something it's not, but still offering unique, quality beer from around the world. For that I give it my fandome and return business.",

Anyway, they have hot dogs too...soooo many choices.  I came with a group and we all easily satisfied our hot dog cravings.  I had the veggie dog with cheese, tomatoes and dill pickles, and it was so so yummy.  Everyone else was thrilled with their dogs as well.

Any place that serves Delirium Tremens on tap deserves high praise!   As a Chicago native, I've had my fair share of meat encased goodness. And while these signature dogs are very good, its hard to crown them the best I've ever had. On the other hand, the fries were perfectly crispy and delicious. therefore a must.  The waiting staff was super friendly and its plugged in a great neighborhood. Overall, I'd give the place 4 1/2 stars instead of the 4 if I could.   What I had: Big Ben hot dog (typical Pittsburgh toppings) Chili cheese fries (the small was enough for two) Cold glass of DT (duh!)

If you want your warmer beers from the cave chilled, there is a chilling station. All six-packs get a dollar-off per beer take-out as well. The ambience isn't as nice as, say, the sharp-edge, but the prices MORE than make up for it. ($4ish for a skulls splitter vs. $9.50 or $10 for example).   Only complaint is that the bar gets noisy and the heat from the grille (behind the bar) can be a little intense in the summer. Couldn't be happier to live down the street from this gem!

    "text": "Frosty drafts, the best veggie dog I've ever tasted, and delicious whole wheat-crust pizza.  Thankfully, since their beer selection is vast and ranges from relatively cheap to ridiculous, the food is generally well-priced.  Toning it down on the drinks can easily bring your bill down to a manageable twenty bucks for two people.  They get a little extra bump from me because they so graciously hosted the Pittsburgh Beer Society for a long time, AND gave PBS members 10% off their beers.  The downside?  Service can be spastic, and I've never seen each person at a table get each of their meals at the same time.  One person can scarf down two (delicious) Chicago dogs long before their partner receives their (equally delicious) calzone.    But Omar, hipsters and yuppies?  Aside from the occasional pair of skinny jeans and a trucker cap or two, I've seen mostly families taking advantage of D's great prices and groups of friends chatting and sharing drinks.  It's definitely not a place to go to see and be seen, which suits me just fine.",

Every loaded fries that passed hooked my eyes like I'd been celibate for a year. Take a dollar off for take-out beer too. I love the descriptions in the menus and how every hot dog is the same price.",

    "text": "Sick tap selection.  Better than anything in D.C. where I currently live.  I was shocked.  So many Stone beers as well as other breweries that I rarely see.  Went here twice while visiting Pittsburgh.  I liked the scene here.  It was low-key and people were polite.  The hotdogs were great.  I had the Chicago dog.  I loved the peppers they put on the dog; not sure what they were.  I definitely recommend this place if you like craft beer.",
