It has a great beer list and when it is nice out (like it was yesterday when I was there) they even open the floor length windows on Carson St. I had a really yummy flatbread pizza - great size and came to the table piping hot.  My friends had wings which they enjoyed.    This is a great place to go before heading across the street to the eccentric and cool Rex Theatre or when shopping the fun and independent shops of Southside.  Also a great place to stay for the night with TVs on sports everywhere in the bar/restaurant.  Upstairs is a open air roof deck, which is fun on nice nights.",

We asked the bartender for a beer list and he pointed at the chalkboard without speaking and walked away.  Our waitress told us she just woke up and didn't have it together yet.  She was right, she was unprepared to come to work and it showed.  The brunch food was adequate at best.  The beer selection was great, so that's why it's 2 stars and not 1.  I would consider going back for dinner when they might have their A team working.",

I just wish there was some place to sit and talk without the loud music.  Local Bar and Kitchen tries very hard to be trendy and the people watching is fun, just not sure it's a good fit for me.",

My friends and I made an 8:30 reservation to sit down and eat, but after arriving only five whole minutes late at 8:35 they gave our table away to some randos. We stood there for literally 30 minutes waiting for them to accommodate us while we watched the people at our original table, that specifically had our friends name written on it, stuff their faces with delight. The waitresses didn't seem to care much, probably because they couldn't hear us over the loud metal music blasting on the second floor. I have to say I can't remember having buffalo chicken dip that good, but the progressive weak feeling in my knees I got from waiting for our second table of the night ruined the experience. I now have chronic tendonitis in my knees.",

I go with honey BBQ sauce and it hits the spot every time. They also do a good job of taking traditional bar foods like pizza, burgers, and sandwiches and giving them a unique twist.   It gets kind of loud in here so don't plan to go here for dinner if you want to have any kind of real conversations.   When I was here in the winter, it was super cold inside their dining area. They had a fireplace heater, but it didn't help much.  The summer is nice because they have a great patio.   I think local is a great addition to the Southside and helps balance out all the shady dive bars on East Carson. Not so great if you want a place just for dinner, but if you want some good drinks too, it's definitely a keeper.",

    "text": "This review is just for Local's food.  Generally, I think Local's food is pretty decent.  As far as lunch and dinner go, I have usually only ordered salads.  I recently (and often) have the salmon salad, which is great with the additions of asparagus and roasted red peppers.  The horseradish dressing is really delicious.  This past weekend I went there for brunch.  It had been awhile since I had been there for brunch, and it was a pretty reasonable experience.  I had a southwestern omelette which was accompanied with \"brunch potatoes\" and toast (though I eschewed the toast).  My friend and I both ordered the \"bottomless mimosas\" for $14.    The last time I went to Local for brunch I didn't find the \"bottomless mimosas\" to be very good, but this time they definitely had stepped up their game.  Our waitress was very diligent in refilling our glasses, as well.  The southwestern omelette was very tasty and done well.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and all the interior ingredients were cooked well, too.  It was a good brunch/breakfast meal.  I'd recommend it to friends.  The only reasons I'm not giving Local more stars is because I think the food is good but not spectacular, and I always feel like it's kind of dirty in there.  I get that it's a bar, but it seems kind of dirty in there sometimes.  For meals it doesn't get too crazy-crowded though.  Generally it's a good place to go out for food and drinks.",

Myself and one guest ordered regular fries, the other chose sweet potato fries with the burger. I previously had their sweet potato fries, but didn't find them as delicious as other restaurants serve. That said, I won't order them again.  Although the waitress was quite friendly, she certainly didn't win points for promptness. It took almost 10 minutes from drink order to drinks on the table. Wasn't sure what was going on in that department.  Overall, a good restaurant with safe-bet, tasty bar food options that will appeal to almost anyone (although the restaurant mostly draws in the 21-35 m/f crowd).",

We sat upstairs on the patio (first time) and I was amazed by how big and open it was. Not only is there an abundance of extra seating, but a second bar! Very convenient!   What I love about Local is there ever-changing menu and ability to incorporate local fresh food. Definitely a huge plus! I ordered the Three Rivers Burger and OMG... was it good! A delicious burger sandwich between a pretzel loaded with cheese, peppers and more! If you're into spicy foods, this is for you! What more can you ask for?! All sandwiches are served with a side of homemade chips but you can substitute for fries for a few extra bucks. Even though it sucks paying extra, it's well worth it! They even have sweet potato fries!   For drinks, all Absolute products were on special for $4 during our visit on Friday night so I ordered a vodka/sprite. Tasty! My boyfriend, however, got an AMAZING Cucumber Melon Smash cocktail (Muddled cucumber and lemon, Effen Cucumber Vodka, melon liquor and honey syrup with a splash of lemonade garnished with a cucumber and lemon). It was one of the best drinks I've ever tasted. So refreshing and light, yet enough to get you feeling good!   Two burgers/fries and three drinks ended up being around $50, however after the Groupon we purchased, the bill was $20. Always look for Groupon deals because they're actively for sale (we got the $19 for $30 deal).",

Many things wrong: *Server was friendly but her server skills were not good (very slow to return/did not clear plates/did not have skills to solve an issue) *ordered appetizers; one came with our dinner; one came after dinner.When we pointed out that we did not receive it, server's comment was \"Oh! I see that\". When she returned to the table she said that the appetizer would be right up (again....after our dinner was done) *3 of the 4 meals were cold (pizzas) Serve was not trained to solve the problem (\"do you want the manager?\" was her solution) Manager was irritated that we were complaining. He went upstairs (did not take our food with him) and came back to tell us they were making new ones for us & that he would take 20% off of the cold food only?? Then he preceded to ask if we wanted our pizza heated up (didn't you just say they were making new ones?) For fear that it would take a long time again(initial order took a very long time to arrive in a restaurant that was not very busy)we said it would be ok to throw them back in the oven...which is really not legal for a restaurant to ask to do in the state of PA .They took almost as long to heat them up as they did to make them initially. *While we were finishing dinner, a cook came downstairs and gave our table dirty looks the entire time he crossed the dining room (to the bar) and then all the way back to the steps. Another person brought food down to another table and gave a glaring look as well. Overall very disappointing way to spend my birthday dinner out with family.",

I went downstairs to wash my hands and showed the manager my hands. He said it was from the heaters from the ceiling leaking soot. He didn't really even offer an apology or give us any type of discount.  Dirty bar, mediocre food. Never going again.",

Walked back in, the two 'bouncers/hosts' didn't greet us, just stood there staring at me...so I walked out.  I'm pretty sure this was a good indication that our experience would not be relaxing.

    "text": "Went on a rainy Saturday around 1 PM and the place was fairly crowded. There were no seats at the first floor bar, but the hostess said we could try the bar on the patio upstairs. After grabbing some stools from nearby tables, we had our space at the upstairs bar. The place was nice, with that trendy, exposed brick kinda look and a \"roof\" that was pretty high up giving the patio a nice, big - almost outdoor - feel. The \"roof\", however, was not really intended to keep all of the elements out as there were a number of leaks around the room, including one behind the bar causing the bartender to put on a garbage bag, \"Steeler Game style\", to stay dry. It was near the end of brunch and there was a Bloody Mary Bar set up, though I didn't see anyone partaking. Carafes of mimosas, though, were being poured at what had to be a record pace.    My friend and I each ordered a beer from their nice beer selection while we decided what to eat. Both of us concluded that basic cheeseburgers were in order. Basic is the best description for what we received. It was good, but nothing special, done to nearly the temperature ordered (which is far better than many other places, including those who have burger in their names!) on a great tasting, very fresh bun. It was well worth the price. The  house-made chips were tasty, but a little soggy from the frying oil. The service was fine, but the music was so loud that my friend and I were having a difficult time hearing each other.  I will definitely go back again, but next time I'll be ordering some mimosas!",

It's always been pretty average and the only difference tonight was that the average night was coupled with a foul smell. The bar smelled like wet dog. I wiped it down with a wet napkin and it came up brown... Anyway, the smell didn't lift, but I stayed for dinner and a drink. I've been told that I MUST try a Pittsburgh steak salad. I decided to give it a go here tonight. I think I prefer regular salads... I liked the mixed greens and the steak was good. The fries were super soggy or super over cooked, which seems impossible to do in one dish, but they did it. Service was ok, nothing impressive. Bartenders and bar backs were talking about how they hooked up with randos, which was entertaining, but things sounded like they could have got a little rapey for one chick. Luckily it was her hook up story, so I guess she was fine. Anyway, I didn't hate it, so I'm sure I'll be back again when looking for a regular time.",

I could walk out with a vat of that stuff and be a very happy girl!  The salmon is fresh and cooked perfectly, or should I say seared to rare perfection. The lettuce is nice and crisp and the asparagus is grilled and flavorful. It's a winning choice.   I also tried their hummus, which is served with warm pita bread. It had a really distinct lemon flavor that I loved. I was surprised how much I liked it!  I'm also impressed at their draft list now. With almost 26 beers on tap you really can't go wrong. If you're  like me and love a nice cold beer outta the tap instead of a bottle youll love the selection (yay for Great Lakes on tap!). If you're worried about the way the place turns at night I urge you to stop in during the day or for dinner and check it out. I really think you'll be surprised.

It comes with fried egg, american cheese, roasted red peppers, bacon, sausage or ham on an english muffin. The brunch potatoes on the side are pretty much like shredded hash browns with what tasted like cumin. There wasn't a whole lot of flavor happening on the sandwich and the portions were awfully small. The sandwich may have tasted a little better if it was on different bread. The music was great though! They were playing throwbacks from the late 90s early 2000s and my friend and I loved every second of it.",

We sat right in front by a large window that they opened so it was almost like being outside.  It was a prime position for people watching in the Southside.  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip appetizer which was pretty good.  It had more of a tart creamier taste than traditional spinach artichoke dip but I still liked it a lot.  Both the chips and pita bread were great with it.  We also ordered a few salads which were huge! The salads did not come with any meat, but they were good without it.  We ended up paying for our meal with a Groupon that was $15 for $30 worth of food.  Our meal cost exactly $30 so we didn't have to pay anything, but wanted to leave a tip on a credit card, so we ended up having to buy a drink for around $3 just to leave the tip. That was really the only issue.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Local as a good place to grab dinner and drinks with friends!",

The weather wasn't great (heavy rain) so that could have attributed to the partially full bar and restaurant.  It was early though, around 6:30, so if you're of the GenX range, this is a normal time, born after that, it is probably early!  Really fantastic happy hour specials.  Domestic bottles and appetizers were half off.  We shared the ballpark pretzel which came with two pretzel sticks and two dipping sauces of cheese or honey mustard.  Very good.  For dinner I ordered some wings and a flatbread pizza.  I immediately boxed half of each to enjoy at a later time, but to be honest, I didn't enjoy the bianca flatbread either time.  It just had little to no taste to it.  The wings were decent though.    Service was ok.  I noticed the wait staff going in and out of the bathroom a lot to use their cell phones.  But food came out quickly and was served hot, so not real complaints.",

Since then, my opinions have changed. Although I still do enjoy going to local, I see them more as a bar now. This place is packed on the weekends, expect a line out of the door on Fridays and Saturdays.   They are famous for their yinseritas, (if I am spelling that right) which is a margarita with a beer in it upside down. Super good! Their menu ranges from pizza, to wings to sandwiches. Everything I ever had to eat there was decently good, but I enjoyed their pizza the most.   Most recently, I visited with a friend for happy hour. Local has a pretty awesome happy hour...1/2 off drafts and some 1/2 priced appetizers. I ordered southern tier's creme brulee , normally $7.50 and only $3.75 during happy hour! Sooo good!   We also ordered their nachos as an appetizer. The portion was HUGE! And they were awesome- pork, tons of cheese, pico and jalapenos with scallions to top it all off... Super good! I did fine the pork to be really salty though.   Our service was great and it always has been consistently good service every time I went. Local is definitely a good place to eat, not just a good place to drink in south side!",

The chicken sandwich was fried in a beer batter and it was so greasy the breading was falling off it wasn't that great and the bacon on it wasn't seasoned or anything it was just average. The sweet potato fries were strange it was like they made them out of the skins of the potato they were really thin. My friend got the grilled cheese sandwich with pot roast and she said it was really garlicky and the seasoning didn't go with the food. I probably wouldn't eat here again I would come back for happy hour though.",

My steelworker burger only had one macaroni on it, where it's supposed to be stuffed with Mac and cheese. And to top it off we were charged with an extra drink on our bill, but at that point we just wanted to leave so we didn't even argue, paid the bill and left. We'll never go back and we are looking forward to see what takes this poor excuse for a restaurants place on Carson street in the near future.",

Besides that the rest of the staff was helpful and pleasant.  I really liked the whole layout of this place & thought it was beautifully designed.  We ordered some pretty fucking good food too!

My son got the Pittsburgh meat lovers omelet. That's probably the way to go here. It's huge and fed both my 10 and 8 year old.  The sausage in the middle was cold.    I got the monte Cristo and was unimpressed. Seemed like the bread was soggy pancake bread, and there was no powdered sugar.  It was definitely not what I would expect in a monte cristo. The potatoes were good though.   Brother-in-law got the eggs Benedict. It's a single egg, single English muffin serving that's light in the hollandaise sauce. He got an extra cup but it was cold and when we got the bill we were charged 70 cents for it. I can't believe that we were charged after he told her it didn't seem like there was any sauce on it. I wasn't impressed with what I tasted.    Finally, who in the world blasts club music at brunch? Once the DJ got here we couldn't hear each other talk, which took away from the experience further.   I'll definitely opt for another brunch spot next time.",

That out of the way, I'll move on to the selling points.  - The appearance and tone of the bar is pretty cool with different set ups and seating going on throughout. The rooftop bar is my favorite area mostly spending my time up there. - The drinks are strong and reasonably priced. - The music is always good, definitely a mixture - plus a jukebox you can play. - The crowd is mostly younger, lively and a good time. - The brunch here is a good price and just about anything you could want - they have a DJ who spins good music and remixes - the selling point being pitchers of incredible mimosas!  I stick to what I know and this bar is close to the top of my list.. good vibe, good drinks and good times.",

    "text": "Oh, Local. I want to love you so much. But I just can't. I want to start this review by saying that I have been here more times than I can count. Sunday funday, weeknight, weekend nights partying, weekday lunches. Now you might ask, for someone who doesn't love the place, why do I continue to give them my money? So I'll start with the positives.  1) It's convenient. My boyfriend lives in the Southside and if we want to get out and watch the weekend football games, this place is pretty reliable. They usually have some sort of special... I feel like Miller Lite on Sundays is practically free. Which brings me to my next point...  2) It's cheap. I mean, it's no $1 beer night at the former Barry's, but you can usually find a special that keeps your tab pretty low.  3) It's a pretty good atmosphere. I personally love to sit at the downstairs bar when the windows are open and people watch. But the upstairs open area is great too.   So among these three positives, we can usually find justification to pop in and stick around for a little while. Now I can get into what makes me not love it.  1) The food. We now know better than to eat here. Everything I've ever eaten has been mediocre at best. You can tell that the quality of ingredients just isn't there. The flatbreads (another special at one day during the week) taste frozen; none of their food has a freshness to it at. all. I've tried burgers, salads, and pizza, and nothing has stood out as something I'd order again. This actually goes hand in hand with....  2) The service. As I mentioned before, I've been here more times than I can count. Literally EVERY TIME, my food order has been incorrect in one way or another. Whether a pizza comes with the wrong toppings or I just get something that I straight up did not order, there is always something off. I finally just gave up forever. I've had a few great bartenders and servers, but the majority are slow, unfriendly, and unhelpful.  All in all, it's definitely not my favorite place but we keep going back for the positives. I don't see myself ever trying to order food here again, but hopefully the service improves someday!",

If you want decent customer service... you MIGHT get it depending on the server.   I've been here 3 different time and tried to give it multiple chances. The first time, our food took over an hour because the server \"forgot to put it in\". We were given a free mimosa.  The second time- my food took over an hour and was completely burnt and hard as a rock. We were given a free Mimosa again. This time- our food took 45 minutes and it is not busy what so ever. The portions were incredibly small and our server was MIA. Our drinks sat empty and we were not offered another drink period.  I've tried time and time again but I just can't with this place. Definitely consider another restaurant.",

I ordered a burger. It came with choice of regular fries, sweet potato fries or breakfast potatoes. I chose the regular fries. My husband ordered the nachos. My burger was cooked perfect but it came without any condiments. My fries were room temperature-borderline cold.  My husbands nachos were good. They had hot sausage mixed in. He liked it but I was not a fan.  The restaurant has a very urban feel. My husband and I were definitely representing the senior crowd. We're not 50 yet,but we were the oldest here by 25 years. Thankfully we are young at heart and willing to try new places. We will definitely come back to give it a second chance when a full menu is being served.",

    "text": "I had read Munch's review of Local Bar + Kitchen in the Post-Gazette.  He seemed indifferent to it, didn't hate the food but had some issues with the whole lack of \"local\" which I totally understand.  So when a Groupon became available I figured I'd take a chance.  I often wonder if places like this read critics reviews.  In the case of Local Bar + Kitchen, it seems they did read what Munch had to say and did make some adjustments.  He wondered where exactly the pierogies made in McKees Rocks were from; the menu now clearly states that they are from Pierogies Plus.  Another one of Munch's criticisms was the lack of local brews; I can now say that they offer selections from both East End and Penn Brewery.    I went ahead and ordered up the pierogies as my appetizer and Big Steve's Meatloaf sandwich as my entree.  The sandwich was very tasty.  I really liked the spicy Heinz glaze.  The pierogies were amazing, of course, but when you start with perfection and add butter, you can't really mess that up.  My service was okay, however it did seem to take awhile for someone to initially take my drink order and then when my pierogie appetizer came out my sandwich followed about 30 seconds later.  When all was said and done, though, my drink was not included in my final bill.  I wasn't sure if it was an oversight or my waitress being nice, but either way I left a nice tip.  One random note: the bathrooms were very clean.  At least the women's room, anyway.    Local Bar + Kitchen is a place I might try again, but it's not the best place to just go for food.  And not all the food is actually \"local.\"  The bar was hopping, though, and it stayed busy.  My suggestion would simply be to omit the word \"kitchen\" from the name of the establishment.  If it was only called \"Local Bar\" people would see the name as describing the place, not their offerings - leading to less confusion and disappointment in diners.",

I guess I am the Yelp Outlier here - I really had fun so hopefully they are reading the fellow yelper comments.  We ordered some food while we were getting our drink on.  I had Steve's Meatloaf Sandwich - it was pretty good.  What made this place fun was the fact it was packed, fun drinks, and a fun group.  We ordered one of their Margarita / Corona drinks (take a frozen berry or traditional Margarita and stick a full bottle of Corona a big fishbowl glass).    Our team (this became a sporting event) really enjoyed these drinks on top of the shots we ordered.  They had a more crowded section upstairs that I do not think I would have enjoyed as much - big screen tv, with poor ventilation + lots of people would have been very uncomfortable.  Our team ventured on down the street later.     If you are looking for a fun time on a Friday Night - this should be one of your spots to visit - but there are others on the street.  Service - Great - the waitstaff was attentive and we had no problems getting our drinks (the place was packed) Price - Not bad / not the cheapest - my beers were $3-6, the crazy drinks I think were around $10 Atmosphere - March Madness, Friday Night, Great Seats (in the window), fun conversation = a good time  I would recommend.",

The food was not as good as I was hoping (even though each time I had gotten different items), and the service (even when I was there with a friend of the owner) was blatantly not good.  My friend made an excuse claiming they must be \"short staffed\" but in an area like the Southside, there should always be a back up plan or someone should step up to help insure decent and acceptable service.    I will say that they had a decent beer list, and the drinks were good, but for those types of things, I have a lot of other choices.  Chances are, I will not be back to Local anytime soon.",

Only thing I do like about this place is the open air/ up stairs patio area in the summer (again depending on day of the week you go and time.) You can do better than this place ;)",

The decor is cool and modern, and perhaps it would have been different had I come for a meal and sat in the dining area.  We decided to sit upstairs in rooftop bar area, and because it was chilly, there wasn't much of a view. Also, they serve drinks in plastic cups up there (which I'm assuming is what they generally do), and I wasn't a fan.  I think I will come back for food next time and sit in the dining rooms. The drinks were good, and the atmosphere seems cool, so I will have to give it another try.",

Some came as sandwiches. Sent mine back. It came back with the wrong sauce and wrong ingredients. Sent it back again.... Now going on over an hour later... My friend decided instead of waiting for her wrap, again, she would get hummus. So we waited for another half hour. They must have been growing the chic peas and crushing them to make the hummus. The hummus finally came. My wrap to follow. With no sauce. At this point, we asked the server for sauce on the side. She brought the sauce, but it was different than the person next to me who ordered the same exact sauce. We don't know still to this day whose wrap was correct.  Anyway, after being incorrect 3 times. There was no compensation. Everyone at the table was done eating and I was no longer hungry.   What a waste of time. Should have went to urban tap.   Would not go back unless it's for drinks.",

Even as it prepares to open you only can imagine what clientele could be entering what may be your future new hang out.  I've given Local 2 stars only because I haven't eaten there yet so I cannot judge it on it's kitchen. I love the look of the bar/restaurant and the roof top deck (if you could move when you're up there).  But to keep this simple, the bar is douche bag city. If that's your kind of people then have at it. If you enjoy the bro's and ho's bar mentality then I think you'll like it. It really wasn't what I expected for this place. I really cannot blame the management, or can I? Could it have been marketed differently? Maybe, but I can only talk about what I saw and I can say I won't be seeing it again.",

I am 9 months pregnant so luckily the hostess had her eye on our table and refilled my water once (I did ask our waitress again later, she forgot). The place was freezing, we asked if she could turn the fan above us off - she said she'd have to ask her manager to do it - maybe he said no? It never went off. The food took over an hour to get to our table and was mediocre at best. The waitress was nice but not apologetic at all for the terrible service, saying that it was \"so busy\" (it wasn't).

The Italian flatbread was just average.. wouldn't order that again. Grilled cheese was made w/ 4 cheeses but was bland & greasy. Thumbs down on that. The Mexican war street burger had guacamole and pico and we all enjoyed it. Sweet pot fries had cinn and sugar and were good!  The only thing I was really impressed by was the Reuben. It was delicious-- better than most other restaurants!! We all LOVED that one.   Will prob be back to get that sandwich and try a few other things..",

    "text": "We finally decided to eat at Local! Bobby had a Sunday morning off thanks to his new job and he's never experienced brunch before because he worked all weekend. We decided on Local for a few reasons. 1) the first place we stopped at had a 1.5 hour wait. 2) their brunch menu looked tasty 3) We never ate at Local before 4) bloody mary bar.. end of story.  We strolled down E. Carson on a sunny Sunday funday and headed into local. For drinks, i got a mimosa carafe (a good 5 drinks.. atleast) it was $8. you could also get unlimited carafe for $14. Bobby ordered from the bloody mary bar. You got to choose your vodka and then it was served to you. The bar was behind you FULL of fresh veggies, spices, hot sauces. Also they had 3 different options for the drink. One was an already spiced bloody mary mix, another was straight tomato juice and the last was V8. I'm not a huge fan of bloody mary, but bobby made a great one! (actually he ordered 2)  For brunch, I ordered Banana's Foster Stuffed French Toast. It was stuffed with honey cream cheese and had a delicious glazed syrup on top, topped with bananas. It came with a side of breakfast potatoes. Bobby ordered the Southern Style Breakfast- sausge gravy over biscuits, piece of ham, sausage, 2 eggs + grits. He seemed to like it but im not sure if he was a huge fan of the grits. I did try the sausage gravy and it was great!  Service was fine and we really liked our brunch date :)   **Not sure if their brunch menu online is up to date. it seemed that a few things were missing. Also, i seen a few people order their sandwiches.. they looked AMAZING!",

    "text": "I went here for dinner this evening and was unimpressed.  I had a Brooklyn Lager, which is a good beer, but at $5.75, it was too expensive.  Burgers seemed to be featured on their menu, so I figured that would be what they did best.  I ordered the Bacon burger with blue cheese rare.  The burger itself was too well done (about what I would expect a medium to be) and was passable but uninspired.  The bun and bacon were not very good.  The bacon had no taste and was way over cooked.  The bun tasted like a giant eagle brand bun.  My girlfriend got a burger with guacamole and pico on it, neither of which had much taste.  The fries were not fresh cut and not very good.  8-10 dollars for a burger is a fair price, but I expected much more.  I wouldn't be opposed to going back and I would try something else on the menu, but I would never recommend this place, especially with Fat Heads a block away, which is superior in every way I can think of.  UPDATE:  I came back for lunch today.  I was at a yoga studio about a block away and decided to give it another shot, since I enjoyed the atmosphere so much.  I got a buffalo chicken salad, which was really awful.  The salad was wilted, and the grilled chicken was tasteless and extremely chewey.  It was served with the same mediocre fries that came with my burger, which were even worse on the salad.  It was a pretty sorry excuse for a buffalo chicken salad.  My friend asked if the jalapenos that came on his burger were fresh.  We were told they were, but the were most certainly from a jar or can.  I don't fault the waitress, becuase it's easy to make these mistakes.  However, fresh jalepanos really would have been better.  By the look of the place, its menu and its name (local!) it seems like a place were everything should be fresh and house made but the food is shoddily made and seems not be taken seriously.  I had a nice pear cider and our waitress was very nice and looked like Marisa Tomei.  They seem to take their drinks seriously (although perhaps they are little expensive).  I would avoid this place for dinner, but I might come back for a drink if I'm in the area.",

Their beer selection isn't massive but it is encompassing of many styles, and I like that they have an assortment of local brews. The thing that will bring me back time and time again is their nachos - the waitress told us they were her favorite, and she was absolutely spot on. That cheese sauce is like melted dreams, demanding a happy satisfaction from every tortilla chip dunk.. Plus the amount of nachos is pretty impressive as well - we had our fill, then invited the crowd of people around us (girl in crutches, here is your shout-out) to take some as well. Mmm, beer and nachos...",

She was attentive, and brought our food quickly. The 21oz. goblet of bloodies are too die for - and six doll hairs! Can't wait to get my little claws on the Yinzerita.

If the crowd sucks, I likely wouldn't come back. I've been here for: lunch, dinner, & late night.    Food review:  I love the concept.  If I were going to open a restaurant (someday, hopefully) I would open a place similar to Local.  The sandwiches I've had were really good, but seriously, if you're going to use giant bread/buns, the middle (meat, veggie, etc) between the bread probably shouldn't fit entirely on 1/3 of sandwich.  Fill the bitch up, or use smaller bread...it's like a short guy buying Magnums...you're not fooling anyone.    Beer review:  How do you have such a weak tap selection when you have a very solid bottle selection?  I don't get it.  Get better draft beers.  Night life:  On an attractiveness scale, the clientele is better than average.  Not mind-blowing, but hey, it's Pittsburgh.  As others have said, it can get a bit douchey.  Also, when I'm drinking at night, I like some mood lighting.  But upstairs, I feel like I'm under a spotlight...wayyyy too bright.  Turn down the lights, I'd rather be surprised at 2am that disappointed at midnight.  I do like the big-ass fan upstairs though.  Downstairs, I like the open windows...I wish more places had this \"feel.\"    Hopefully they go uphill & not downhill...I will be back.",

The early Sunday crowd was a mix of ages and background so we did NOT feel like we were creepers in a kid's bar.  Uncommonly, I ordered linguini and meatballs.   Friend ordered chicken diablo.   Both  were geat and prepared as they should be.   The tomato basil suce was fantasitic.....tasted like tomatoes, basil garlic, and other good stuff!   Chicken was spicey but not crazy hot like some diablos.  Sevice was quick and friendly.   Beer selection was a little limited, but I found something tasty.  I can give this a cautionary recommendation.........I wouldn't go in if it is prime bar time and crowded.  Save it for another time.  (The same caution goes for FATHEADS too!)",

The name comes from the fact that the majority of items they serve are procured from local vendors (farms, breweries, ect). That's no gimmick though as they won't let you down on quality, taste, and unique surprises. I say unique surprises because their menu is loaded with uncommon, foodie friendly dishes. I've never been crazy impressed with places serving pierogi until here. And when you read over the dessert menu and find cheesecake stuffed pierogi don't run, but give in; you'll be glad you did 'cause they are BOMB! The hummus is a winner as well as the burgers and flat bread pizzas. Yes, all with an uncommon offering of toppings and style. They also have a great selection of drinks on tap. While I didn't take the opportunity to visit upstairs, read the other reviews and see that the rooftop deck is pretty sweet. I'll be going back to have my own experience there.",

    "text": "I've been to LB+K 3 times now and can officially say I probably won't go back.  The first two times were at night and it was just your average over-crowded South Side bar.  The large open windows downstairs and the deck upstairs are great features and give any bar/restaurant great potential.  Unfortunately this great atmosphere cannot make up for LB+K's terrible service and mediocre food.  My friends and I went here for afternoon drinks on a Friday and sat upstairs on the deck as it was lovely outside.  We were literally the only people on the deck at first and our server still seemed completely overwhelmed or hungover - something was off.  My friend tried to order an IPA, but every one on the menu was out or not available for some odd reason.  (Not that our server knew this - he had to go try to get this beer and come back about 3 times to inform her the beer was not available.)  Finally our server suggested a beer for her, and she got it 30 minutes later, sans any apologies for the tardiness.  We ordered the pretzel appetizer and nachos.  The pretzels were obviously just defrosted soft pretzels, but the queso and honey mustard were pretty good.  The nachos took about 40 minutes to come out, after our server and a manager informed us \"they were on their way\"... no idea what took them so long.  When the nachos finally arrived, they were missing cheese so our server had to take them back to add that... they ended up being average nachos.  Our server then messed up our next drink order and brought out an extra beer.  We said we didn't want it, but he informed us just to keep it and he'd take it off anyways.  (Clearly they were just going to dump it out anyways - we may as well drink it.) When our bill finally came, the drink was on it and our server claimed he couldn't take it off.  (We've all served in restaurants before and know this is not the case.)  There was also never any apologies for the slow service/lack of beers.    In the end, we left LB+K feeling robbed and disappointed for a place with so much potential.  I can only say that I'm glad we tried this place so I know to avoid it in the future.",

But there was nothing special or that stood out from this restaurant that delivered on that promise. Just your typical bar food selections such as burgers, wings, sandwiches, and pizza. Which, of course, there is nothing wrong with. Who doesn't love a great pizza or burger? Sadly, the food was just okay. They do have a 50 cent wing night with a nice selection of sauces, but that is definitely not enough to keep me coming back. Also, the service was awful. I know being a server can be an exhausting job, but our waitress just acted angry to be there and do her job. She wasn't prompt, pleasant, or seemed to be upset we were even there. Maybe she was just having an off night, but her attitude was a large turn off. When my burger came, it was very overcooked and dry as well as flavorless. And reading other peoples' reviews, it looks like I'm not the only person this has happened to. And for the quality, the prices were too high. There are many other places in the south side that you can get this same fare from, but is far better. I don't recommend stopping here.",

We got here about 6-6:30pm and there was plenty of seating for the four of us.  It was very warm in the bar and they said they didn't want to put the air conditioning on or allow us to open the large windows facing the sidewalk.  We asked them to adjust the ceiling fan to blow down instead of circulating up (winter mode), and they did.  Upstairs was being renovated and it was a bit too dark for what I preferred. Hubs and I both had pulled pork sandwiches yinzer style with very tasty homemade chips.  Very good!  Our boys had tasty looking burgers and fries.  The place was comfortable with tv's around and decent seating with lots of light (close to the door/bar) and got livelier as our meal went on.  By 7:30ish the crowd was mainly young 20's and some were rude and mouthy.  Glad to get out of there when we did.  A little too much cleavage and cursing for my liking as a mom of a 14 and 11 yr old. Also ordered the fried pickles for an app.  So-so.  Probably more so just my taste, not the quality of them. Since we had the groupon and I was trying to spend at least $60, we ordered the only dessert they offered - chocolate cake.  Oh dear God that was good!! All in all, a very nice place!",

We all roughly arrived around 11:30 and were greeted by lovely hostess, and the smiles were the only positive highly of our experience. This brunch spot was highly recommend and we were eager to dive in. I'll break down the morning by courses:   Drinks- Fair priced and you get pay for. Sky and OJ ($3) was Sky with a splash of OJ. Some other people in our party ordered the $8 mimosa carafe. Solid deal and I was told they give you a full bottle of champagne.   Timing on our food- All of our dishes 10+ came out together, but it was VERY obvious that a majority of our dishes were cooked and placed under a heat lamp for a significant amount of time. The system of cooking and having the food sit is unacceptable. By the time everyone received their dish, we dug into cold breakfast food! That's not how I want to start my morning.   Taste/Quality- Underwhelming. For those at the table whom ordered eggs (eggs Benedict, over easy, medium, etc.) received over medium. The asparagus (garnish?) was soggy and lacked taste. The eggs Benedict i received had hash browns that were as grey a storm cloud. Also, the side of hash browns were spicy as all heck! It's like they placed the whole pepper shaker in the pan.   Overall Experience- When I come back to visit Steel City I will be skipping The Local. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, but you simply cannot serve food cold and over cooked to me in the AM. Good Day Sir!",

Basically just 5 (not fresh) mint leaves stuck in the drink. I didn't even finish it. Complete waste of $9. Spinach and artichoke dip wasn't bad but was nothing special. Mostly seemed like a cheese dip though with a tiny amount of spinach and artichoke. At least the pita was warm. It's a shame because they have a pretty decent rooftop bar area.

The restaurant as a whole is in a beautiful building and on the surface, it appears as the perfect place for a brunch.  However walking in, there were buckets in the floor collecting water from the ceiling and the condiments on our table were filthy and covered in dust.  The service was absolutely terrible. For a table this size, it would've been nice to have some pitchers of water and napkins on the table for our convenience. Instead, we had to rely on our waitress who remained in the corner of the bar talking with her coworkers for the entirety  of our stay.  The young boy who delivered our food showed no absolutely no enthusiasm and was of no help when two of my friends didn't receive the burgers they had ordered. Our waitress advised the burgers would be out shortly and brought their side of potatoes to tide them over. About 30 minutes later, the manager came over. He briefly apologized for be delay and brought us waters which we were all waiting for. The burgers finally arrived another 15 minutes after that, but all that was on both their plates was a burger patty with an egg on it. The description of the burger on the menu was that it included cheese and caramelized onions. After we informed our waitress, she brought back up 2 slices of cold cheese and red onions.  Working in the restaurant business myself, I can understand that mistakes happen but our waitress was not at all apologetic. In fact, she didn't even check back up on them to make sure they were satisfied after all of the mishap. She was too busy watching the heard of motorcycles driving by outside with the other waitress. Upon getting our checks, she informed the both of them that 20% off was taken off each of their bills for the burgers being wrong.  As a group, we are all very easy going and understanding of things going wrong. But for our waitress to be as unhelpful as she was, was a huge disappointment and enough for me to leave a bad review, something in which I don't normally do. Safe to say I won't be back and will certainly not recommend this place, especially after reading the other negative reviews given.",

We watched everyone around us seem to get adequate service while we had to beg anyone to bring us basic things. We watched parties that came in after us get their food and eat. We watched the wait staff eating bacon at the bar while we sat with out food for an hour and a half.   When the food finally came (after asking about it half a dozen times and getting runaround responses), only 5/7 of us got food, 2/5 were incorrect. I suppose we should have been grateful to get anything at all. We had no silverware or napkins. We asked the waitresses and she distributed forks from a can.   I took a a few bites of my eggs and somehow there were egg shells in my poached eggs with no napkin to spit my food into. We had grown use to fending for ourselves at that point, so we grabbed napkins from the bar. I was also just happy to have food, unlike almost 1/3 of our party. Despite the shells, I ate what I could and it was good.   15 minutes later they brought food for the other person in our group, so now it's been 1:45 and 6/7 have food. The waitress comes back to report that she doesn't know about the last person getting their food, or the missing eggs from another plate. We wait. She returns with bad news. The kitchen is closing down. They took so long to serve us that I guess we ran out of time and one of us won't be eating. Better luck next time. Err not next time, not ever.   We asked for the manager, who I felt should have been involved before this point and they comped our food and a round of drinks. This was maybe an adequate response, though I wish they could have done more. We didn't leave feeling satisfied and it's thoroughly ruined the rest of my day.  In all my life I've never had a worse experience at a restaurant. I still can't believe what transpired. I would strongly caution future patrons from supporting this establishment as it's the worst run business I've encountered.",

    "text": "It took me a while to return here from my last visit and all I could remember about this place is that I left feeling quite full.  As I said in my prior review, this place rocks, still.  Instead of venturing upstairs for our meal, we opted to sit at the bar where there would be minimal delay in our order and delivery of food.  Smart move.  I had myself a Yinzerita like I did the last time and I stayed with a burger, but this time I decided to try something new to me.    I had opted for the B3 burger.  Beef, bacon and barbecue sauce.  Don't just think of the bacon as on top of the burger, it's also mixed with the beef inside the patty.  Juicy as ever and with the right amount of tang from the barbecue sauce.  Pair this with a side of the fries and it's a mighty good meal that will remind you of what good finger food is.  However, from the time I visited until I wrote this review, I have heard a nasty rumor that the B3 is no longer available.  I visited their website recently and after looking over the menu section I do not see it listed.  That may mean that this burger is extinct.  If that is the case, that makes me sad.  The bartender on duty that ended up serving us was amazing.  She was helpful when we had a question about items on the menu and great at giving suggestions.",

The name would make you think you'd be encountering a nice selection of local beer or local food. Neither is really the case. They don't even have a higher volume of local brewers than on average.  The food is standard Sysco bar food with inconsistent cooking quality.  If you want local beer, go to Pipers. They've got local beer and clean their taps.  If you want a party, go to Mario's or Carson City.",

Our drinks and pot roast nacho app were served timely. The pot roast nachos were delicious and did their job getting our appetites going. GrapeWife had a nice looking Cobb Salad that tasted as good as it looked. I got the Pittsburgh Pretzel. It is a kielbasa sandwich topped with cheese, kraut, mustard and a couple of pierogis. It was good and tasty. My only compliant is it reminded me of the old Wendy's \"Where's the beef?\" the tiny pice of kielbasa was dwarfed by the pretzel bun.  Local is a cool place with a cooler menu. Give it a try the next time you're looking for something different in the South Side.",

The food, however, hasn't remained really good.   The last time I went with a friend for brunch. It took 20+ minutes to order and another 20+ minutes to receive my order. (She'd gotten there early and had already finished eating before I got a chance to order.) I got the bananas foster french toast. Like many things on the menu, it *sounds* delicious and creative. What you get is always a let down from that expectation.  \"2 croissants with fresh bananas and honey cream cheese. With house potatoes.\"  Well, the croissants were there. The bananas were not, which is a pretty big oversight in \"bananas foster\" anything. The croissants were covered in an incredibly sugary, thick sauce. The honey cream cheese was so thick and cold like it just came out of the fridge, I couldn't eat it. The potatoes were fine.  It took a long time to order, get food, get refills, get checks, get our cards back, etc. It was sunny that day- a warmish Sunday in February- so they had the front doors open. But it was still only 50 with a breeze. Sitting just next to the host stand at the doorway, we were cold and in our coats. We asked the hostess to close the doors, and she had to get a manager due to their height. He closed one of the double doors...which only made the breeze stronger and us colder. When I asked him directly, he obliged and closed the second.  Just poor service. Slow and inattentive, and the food was definitely not good enough this time to even that out. I dont think I'll be back.  Oh! It was alllll 90s music while we were in there. That's one part I didn't mind",

It has a prime location on the South Side, it's clean, it offers a variety of indoor / outdoor seating options, the food is tasty and the staff is friendly.  All that said, I am completely ambivalent about the place.  I don't know what it is.  Perhaps it's the $9 appetizers and the fact you can't even get a simple salad for under $8 or maybe it's something else like the atrocious South Side parking situation.  I don't know really.  Hm.

Local can get obscenely packed, way moreso than other Southside establishments, most likely due to it being relatively new.   If you're lucky enough to be there on a night where it's jumping but not suffocatingly packed, Local can be a decent hang-out spot especially out on the patio in the summer.  The crowd is the typical Southside bar crawl crowd but if you're looking for sophistication and cosmopolitan feel... why go to the Southside? Folks are friendly enough, the service is fast if you can get to the bar but the prices can be a little expensif esp. for shots.  Still, I'd say I like Local for a night of drinking and swearing, if the weather's nice and the place isn't jam packed.",

We shared a margherita pizza and I must say they have hands down the BEST margherita in the city. The crust is perfect, it's thin with a great mix of cheese, tomatoes and basil. Too many of the places I visit tend to sprinkle what looks like 5 pieces of basil across a large pizza. Not Local.  My only complaint is that it always takes forever to get a pizza. I've been here a handful of times, and it's the same every time - 40 minutes to an hour. Kind of ridiculous, really. First time I took my boyfriend, raving about their pizza, we ended up waiting close to an hour and a half because our first pizza was burned. Fortunately, we were in good moods and our bartender was mixing excellent drinks. It also helped that the manager came out himself to apologize, took our pizza off the bill, AND upgraded it to an entree size (we originally ordered the smaller one). AND my boyfriend ended up loving the pizza and we were back the next weekend. :D  I like going and just hanging out at the tables or at the end of the bar nearest the windows, even when it's not nice out. I love fresh air and, of course, South Side has excellent people watching. I hear this place gets hopping at night, but I wouldn't know as I haven't been out to South Side at night.",

The player had just signed with another team and they told me that I couldn't have the sandwich because the player didn't play for the Penguins anymore.  At first I thought she was joking, but she was serious, and I couldn't get the sandwich.    I literally was grossed out by the smell of the Mojito Chicken sandwich that was served to me on my first visit.  On my final visit I ordered the Plane Jane Street pizza (standard cheese pizza, pretty hard to mess up), the crust was soggy, it was over garlic'ed, and there was some kind of sauce on the edge of my pizza that I had no idea what it was.  Luckily the sauce didn't have any flavor so it didn't impact the pizza.  There are much better places on the South Side to eat, while Local tries to cater to the foodie crowd by offering locally grown product they just don't deliver with good tasting food.",

When the bar finally opened for St. Patrick's Day weekend, I enjoyed some cocktails on the superb rooftop deck. I had not properly dined there, however, until this past Friday evening.  I arrived with two friends around 7pm and was immediately greeted by the sickly sweet smell of vomit. That was almost enough to turn us away, but since we were immediately seated at a prime table overlooking Carson Street, we decided to stick it out.  In spite of the early hour, club-style music was blaring and we were forced to shout to hear one another. Thankfully the restaurant boasts a decent selection of beers on tap. (Stella Artois is suprisingly elusive in the 'burgh.) However, when the beer arrived my friend's glass was literally covered in lipstick marks. Strike two!  We ordered food which arrived quickly considering the packed space. The menu boasts that its salads are \"made with the freshest locally grown Anthony's Original Produce.\" Unfortunately, my Speedy Southwest Salad tasted anything but fresh. The lettuce was limp, the tomatoes were mushy, and the grilled chicken, which I chose to add, was rubbery and burnt. My companions' burgers, although large, didn't taste much better.  It's truly a shame that the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the space and utensils was so poor, because, in spite of the noisy soundtrack, the atmosphere of Local is pretty great. It's a mix of rustic and industrial chic, with wide plank wood floors, large iron gears bolted to the walls, and exposed beams and funky metal light fixtures on the ceiling. Assuming the vomit smell can be got under control, it's not a bad place for an after work cocktail or late night libation.  Once the weather is consistently warm, patrons can avoid indoor smells altogether and enjoy the fantastic view from the restaurant's best asset, its rooftop deck.",

Our server was super sweet and helpful, recommended a brew for the bf and sangria for me, which was a huge goblet of yum. They have some great vegetarian/vegan options on the menu and they all sounded really good. I wasn't very hungry, and snacked on the hummus, which was garlicky but good. My bf ordered a mediterranean-style 'za, and he siad it was very good.   I'll be back here again!",

Checked in at 12:10- was told a wait would be around 30 minutes and at 12:45 I asked....\"How much longer would our wait be?\" I was told 2-3 HOURS!! No notification or any reference to us waiting. That however was not the overall cause of this post, the angering part was the countless number of \"Reserved\" tables around us and seemingly endless tables walking out with us standing at the bar. When I called earlier I was told the iPad was dead so a reservation was not possible. Only to be told at 12:45 that same day reservations are no accepted. The EXCUSE was that the kitchen was behind because the power went out the day before. WTF?!? On a Sunday when relaxing is the objective AVOID LOCAL at all costs!",

Ended up with a SA Pumpkin beer which came with a spiced rimmed glass, nice touch.    Food was decent, pulled pork sandwich with side of asparagus.  Sandwich was really good, but the asparagus were minature.  Overall, appeared to be a solid spot and would go back next time in Pitt.",

We had been to Local plenty of times at night for drinks but had never tried their food for a sit down restaurant experience. As far as decor and vibes, Local is a cool, upbeat place to eat and drink and enjoy the South Side atmosphere. However, the food and service is what disappointed us.  We ordered: Buffalo Chicken Sand which (sub provolone for Swiss) with sweet potato fries and a buffalo chicken salad. We received a very small salad with plain ice burg lettuce, onion, tomato, and chicken. Keep in mind that the salad was listed for about 9 dollars. The sandwich that came had absolutely no buffalo sauce and instead of the sweet potato fries I ordered, I was given regular fries that were definitely cheap store bought frozen fries.   Overall, the food and service was a disappointment. A waitress should be able to deliver the correct order to the kitchen and make sure it is up to par. After bringing out our food, we didn't see her until she brought the check!  Bottom line: Go to Local for drinks. If you want lunch, check out The Library further down East Carson Street in the South Side.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this spot, which is in a good location and has a wonderful deck.  Sadly, the wonderful ended there.  I've been there twice now, first on a weekend for drinks, where the bartender was chatting with a waitress while people waved and shouted for drinks.  I thought I would try a more quiet night for the second trip and went in mid week, to sit on the deck and eat dinner.    Despite the nearly empty restaurant, service was very slow, and never visible except when delivering food.  We ordered a few beers, two steaks and a sandwich.  The food took a little too long to arrive and with it came the news that Local doesn't have steak knives. \"They've been on order for weeks.\" the server offered,  The butter knife will cut it,it's just real slow.\"  Really?  A functioning restaurant in Pittsburgh and no one can take the time to stop by a restaurant supply store and pick up something basic like steak knives?  Doesn't speak well of the management.  Both steaks were ordered medium rare, one arrived rare, the other was completely well done & grey to the center.  The sandwich had obviously been made when the order was first put in, as the top of the bread was rock hard from the heat lamp, and the cheese had leaked out onto the plate and congealed.   The \"salad\" that came with it was a handful of iceberg lettuce with a single, sad tomato wedge on top.  The whole thing is really a shame, as the location is good, and the rooftop deck is great. (and has an awesome huge fan in the middle of it)  With a chef that cannot control their kitchen enough to make sandwiches properly and management that runs for weeks without silverware, this place sadly, has no chance.  In a competitive area like the South Side, there's too much good stuff around to waste more time at Local.",

Had a table upstairs here when it was empty, took 25 minutes to get 3 bud lights and 2 captain cokes delivered to table. On top of that, food mostly blows. Probably will go back just, and only because, of it's location. Male bartenders upstairs are extremely inconsistent with time of service. Upstairs also smells really bad on weekend nights.

It's like a completely elevated experience. Hats off to the staff of Local for updating their menus, adding vibrant new decor and providing stellar service. The brunch was absolutely phenomenal.   I ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich and everything was more than I could have asked for. A thick helping of breakfast ham filled the sandwich alongside a fluffy fried egg and cheesy Gruyere. The vanilla infusion was evident in the French toast and the breakfast potatoes were just how I like them, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I also recommend the mimosa carafes - one for $12 or two for $20, a definite steal.  This was probably the best brunch experience ive had of the year and I'm looking forward to making Local our Sunday brunch spot.",

We were seated in the front table of the restaurant located next to the large windows, it was a 45 degree day and they were wide open. We requested our waitress to close the windows and she did. However, the bartender (who was very rude) came over and told the waitress the heat was on and it was too hot on the other end of the restaurant so they needed to remain open. We were back to freezing and the table next to us was also complaining and had to put their coats back on.   We ordered 2 dips and meals, which took 55 minutes to come out. The dip appetizers were served with the food, only one of which came out. The food was cold, specifically the eggs for brunch were so cold that the cheese didn't even melt. A steak knife was not provided with the steak and eggs which made it difficult to eat. The second dip was never brought so we requested them to take it off the bill and forget about it (as they clearly did.)  We asked to speak with a manager as this was just the experience from hell. Our waitress tried to get him to come over, however he apparently told her that he didn't want to deal with it and sent over another manager on duty. We complained about the above regarding the service, food, and the overall attitude of the bartender regarding the windows. The manager listened and discounted our meals, however we will definitely not be back and to top it off the waitress was so frustrated she quit!!   This place really needs to be taken over by Jon Taffer and the bar rescue crew.",

It took quite a long time for our drinks to be served to us after ordering them but they tasted great.  The pierogies & spinach artichoke dip was soooo good. I don't normally like spinach artichoke dip that much but this was so creamy & good.   My friend got the fried chicken sandwich and I got the steelworker burger (I think that's the name). Chicken was great but way too much bun. The steelworker has Mac n cheese between two patties, covered in bacon, deep fried, topped with queso and jalapeno relish. I pictured a behemoth of a burger to come out. It honestly wasn't bad at all. I wish there were more Mac n cheese inside the burger. It was like a spoonful of Mac. You couldn't taste the bacon but it's a novel idea to wrap anything in bacon. It tasted really good overall.   We were filled to the brim.   Our server was really nice, however, there was hardly no one in there at all (4 ppl which included us) and we had to ask for silverware, then small plates for the apps, then ketchup etc.   I'm not knocking this place.

Plates were coming out that no one ordered, everything was salty, and the ham...was horrifying. We all ate our meals from pure starvation but i'd have rather starved. The waitress comped drinks for everyone to make up for the issue. However, I wasn't even drinking. So, it was no benefit to me. We never saw a manager and the poor waitress just seemed overwhelmed and defeated. The whole entire staff also reacted to the mishaps as if these screw ups are the norm. Not worth going to for anything when there are plenty of delicious places all around.",

The mimosas were a nice pairing too. It was fairly busy, but that's to be expected on a Sunday morning and justifiable for such a well known establishment. I really liked natural lighting in the restaurant, and the wait staff was great! With such a positive experience, we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I visited Local Bar and Kitchen this evening for a low key anniversary dinner with my girlfriend. We were seated immediately because there wasn't too large of a crowd in the dining area. I ordered the Old Faithful burger and added blue cheese. My girlfriend ordered the fried chicken sandwich.   Our waitress was kind but she was the only person working in the dining room. Why on a Sunday night after a Steelers play off game is there only one waitress? She could hardly keep up to come over and take our order.   The restaurant was FREEZING and it easily took 40 minutes for our food to arrive to our table. I know the bar was pretty busy but there were only 4-5 tables in the dining area. I think it was a little ridiculous we waited that long for food.   Finally our food arrived to our table without the side of mayo and ranch we put with our order originally. It took 10 minutes for our server to come back and see if we needed anything. I took a bite of my burger to check if it was cooked medium rare. It was so well done and any of the juice that may have been left in it soaked in the bun. My cheese was no where to be found. The only thing hot on the plate was my fries.   My girlfriends chicken sandwich was really good and if I'd ever return here I'd get that. The flavors were there chicken was a little dry but overall a good bite.   Once the waitress returned I explained to her my food was way over cooked. She talked to the kitchen and within 5 minutes they brought me another one. This one was much fresher than what I was originally given. The burger was cooked correctly but it lacked seasoning.   This restaurant is a sandwich and bar food place. If that's all you serve then you need to work on your food. This place has an obvious lack of communication and whoever manages this place needs a reality check.   I hate to be so harsh with a review but I was extremely disappointed with my experience. I hope this place turns their restaurant around or I don't see it being there too much longer.   P.S. I forgot to mention they were out of 4-5 things on the menu. Good thing it wasn't anything I had wanted to order.",

    "text": "A group of friends and I came here from out of town during a bachelorette party. We had a large party and they were accommodating of all of us, however our experience here was awful. The tables were dirty and sticky, the ketchup bottles were covered in dust, there were buckets on the ground to catch who knows what dripping from the ceiling and the bathroom doors didn't lock.  On top of that, our waitress barely came to our table. She was very inattentive. A friend and I ordered burgers and she brought out two omelette instead. When she came back she told us the kitchen had made a mistake and the burgers would be two minutes. Clearly we knew that it wouldn't take two minutes to cook two burgers, but when they came out 20 minutes later, the order still wasn't right. The burgers were supposed to come with an egg, caramelized onions and cheese. When she brought them out, they were just burgers with an egg on top. When we asked her about this again, she went back to the kitchen and brought us each a plate with a slice of American cheese on it to put onto our own burgers and a cup of grilled onions. She never apologized or checked on any of our table to see how our food was, even after the mix up. It was honestly ridiculous. The situation could have been made better if our waitress had been apologetic, but she was not at all.   We thought the situation could at least be somewhat redeemed if she had taken our burgers off of the bill but when she came back she told us she took off only 20% ($1.80). This was an absolutely horrible experience for our entire party. Worst service at a restaurant I have ever had and the food wasn't very good either. Would not recommend this place for anyone.",

The fact that it was Halloween was probably the driving factor behind that.   When I got there and sat at the bar, it took about 15 minutes before the bartender came over to me. There was only one working when I got there. When a second bartender came on about 30 minutes later, the service improved. They were friendly, but a little bit on the slow side, which was surprising because it wasn't too busy when I got there.   Food was decent. I had the smoke ribs. They fell off the bone but seemed like they were a bit overcooked. Came with a coleslaw that I enjoyed and I don't usually like cole slaw. Beer selection was mainly IPA heavy and seasonal beers. Not much variety outside of that.   I'd go back, but I don't know if I would stay as late as I did this time.",

The interior of the bar and restaurant are opened to the outdoor air on nice days. Unfortunately, my experience didn't match the ambiance.  The service here is one of two stories. Our first bartender only acknowledged us when we first arrived. We ordered a beer and a vodka cranberry, which we received with our first order. The well drink had a weak pour. After that, we were not acknowledged for the next 20 minutes. The next bartender Wendel, was fantastic, stopping by frequently to check on what we needed as customers. In general, it seemed like most of the service staff distracted one another by holding side conversations and horseplay. Considering the place wasn't busy during our stop here, we were disappointed by the initial lack of service.  One of the shining inventions at this bar is the \"Yinzerita.\" A margarita with a beer of your choice poured inside. The beer doesn't add anything special to the flavor of the margarita. However, it is an extremely novel drinking concoction. As a part of visiting here, everyone should have one.  We also ordered a \"Plain Jane\" pizza while we were here. We got the larger of the two pizzas they offered and it is the size of a regular bar pie you would find at most restaurants. The pizza had a thin crust, bitter sauce, and regular cheeses. It took around 40 minutes to deliver the order. Based on the size of the pie, it should have taken a lot less. Overall, I was disappointed in the delivery and taste of the pie.",

Part of the fault on the restaurant for only having 1 bartender but she passed us multiple times without asking if we are ready to order. After ordering another 20 minutes went by, without our appetizer coming yet, where the bartender tells us that one of the main meals we r ordered is sold out. An hour after ordering we then received our appetizer and then meals shortly after. The nachos were excellent, the Reuben we give a 3/10 and the grilled cheese was boring. Wouldn't recommend it and don't plan on going back anytime soon. Just glad we had a groupon so we didn't have to pay full price.",

At this time, the dining area was not busy and we had no wait to sit, although there were several other diners there.  Unfortunately the weather was crappy that day so no patio experience for us.   The interior of Local is pretty nice looking.  I loved their menus (nerd) and seating arrangements.  Our service was quick and very friendly.    I was inspired to order the Amazing Yoga Asparagus Salad with Salmon since it was named for my fave studio right across the street!  It was a filling salad with delicious grilled asparagus, other veggies and a bunch of goat cheese.  The salmon was cooked very nicely and I was impressed with the quality of the fish.  The best part of the salad, though, was the horsey vinaigrette.  Yum!  My husband got the cheeseburger with bacon (of course) and said it was \"good\".  So probably an average burger here.  Our waitress did make a mistake on our bill (charged for an extra beer that we ordered but they actually didn't have on tap), but when we brought it to her attention she was really apologetic and fixed it quickly and gave us both coupons for our next visit.  A little thing like that can really make a difference in your experience!  I was pleased with my meal at Local.  The service was good, the food was creative and tasty, and the atmosphere was nice (early on a weekday at least).",

    "text": "I cannot say enough good things about Local! My sister turned 30 this week, and being the sister I am, I knew that we had to do it up in style. Local came through like a champ for this!!  I contacted Local about two months ago and asked about having a large group for dinner. Dana was amazing and so helpful. While most other places wanted to charge a fee upwards of $400 for a 2-3 hour party, Local simply asked that we make reservations and pre-select a menu. Dana offered us a big table in the newly enclosed deck upstairs (and included construction updates in a few of the emails we exchanged!) They gave us plenty of time to make the menu choices, let us bring our own cake, cupcakes, provided dishes for  dessert,  and even took the cake and cupcakes in the back, lit the candles, and brought it out from the kitchen for us.   Earlier this week, my sister's roommate asked if we could order champagne for the table. I gave her Dana's contact info and we had an answer within a few hours, that yes, she could have that all set up.   When we got to the restaurant last night, everything was set up and ready to go. The staff all knew that we were there for a birthday party and made a big deal for the birthday girl. Since we had already ordered, we had a little time to hang out and chat while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. The food was absolutely delicious. Some of the favorites from the table were the steak and chips (I think 5 of us ordered this, and it was melt in your mouth (literally) delicious!!), the aloha chicken, and the shrimp diablo.  The waitstaff who took care of us was amazing. Shannon and Matt were so friendly and fun! They offered to take pictures for us, took care of the cake, and were ever vigilant when drinks were running low. They even took the extra time to make sure that paying the check wasn't a hugely complicated process. This is the first time that I've been to a restaurant in a group this size and not have any mistakes on the bill.   If you ever need a great place for a group/party/special night, go LOCAL!!",

    "text": "Hmmmm. Y'know, for a place that is laboriously trendy, you'd think they would have dreamed up a more inspired name.   Finding out that LB+K's kitchen had caught fire from the blatantly distressed, remorseful owner himself when last we visited created a tender spot in my heart for them. So without brunch plans this Sunday, Kay and I decided to give them another shot early in the afternoon.   When strolled in, we were told to seat ourselves and noticed that the joint wasn't exactly stirring with activity. In fact, no one was eating anything yet.  Our minds were set on trying their brunch. Kay ordered the Eggs Benedict, I ordered the Steak and Eggs but was told by our petite server Tee that they were out of steak.  So I went with the Local Pittsburgher, a burger with caramelized onions and a fried egg along with raw onion, tomato, lettuce, and a few pickle spears.   Ehhhh, I dunno. My patty, which I ordered medium, seemed to come out well-done. The egg, like the patty, was a little overcooked as well. The bun tasted slightly stale. However, the fries that came with the burger were crispy, soft, and were pretty accomplished over all.   Dessert consisted of a block of tiramisu that came off as a thawed-n-shipped, not local, creation. It wasn't deplorable, but I could probably get something just as good out of a supermarket freezer.   I definitely picked up a hipster vibe as young urbanites gravitated towards the window seats in order to be seen. The decor was kind of \"rough\" like a warehouse loft apartment.    Regardless of LB+K's lack of activity this afternoon, the service was slowwww goin', man.   One male server was apparently a bit, uhhh...cheeched if you feel what I'm gettin' at.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DRPvZ173xNnw&s=112e483192e3aead827f5e2aef9946d8d5ec0b1349a30228f383612d4c1ab1f4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=RPvZ...</a>  The female servers both wore brushed-on black leggings in order to display the contours of their buttocks, create an illusion of  waist-down nudity, and therefore bring in the male big-spenders.   Sweat pants are worn for comfort also, so I don't care to hear that defense. For what it's worth, the guys wore baggy jeans. Those are comfortable too. The girls don't wear those, however, since nobody stares at an ass obscured by loose denim. Is that what they want me to do? Gawk at booty? I was with my girlfriend! Even if I wasn't dining with Kay or was single, does management want me to think a nice tip might *ahem* get me somewhere with a waitress?  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DbvbETP7LM74&s=0753e2f727861685ec1bc1334e5b6e87a0006db61b165f7033513474c22e97a8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=bvbE...</a>  Does the dress code come from above?   I suppose I feel insulted a tad since my libido's expected to give way to logic in these instances. I also find it a bit degrading for the help involved.  Nonetheless, I generally tip well out of sympathy for the service industry and due to having a big, dumb heart. Solidarity.  I was rooting for LB+K. Meh.   P.S. Tee was a nice enough waitress, and I wager our long wait was more the kitchen's fault than hers.   P.P.S. For those who like booze with their brunch, Mimosas and Bloody Marys are available.   P.P.P.S. Kay's Eggs Benedict was easier on the eyes than any chick in tights. Nice plate job, dude.",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch after doing some shopping in the Strip District. Unfortunately they were only serving off their brunch menu until 2pm. Beer selection was pretty good. We had drinks at the bar prior to our table being ready, bartender was attentive and helpful. Wish she had been our server. Our server was slow and not the most attentive. Numerous time had to ask for more water and took her some time to bring the drinks despite seeing them on the bar waiting. Food was ok, because it was brunch no French just home fries with the burger. Burger quality was ok, bun was delicious but burger was over cooked. My mother in law ordered the a steak salad. When the salad came out there was no steak and no oil/vinegar. When the runner was asked for both he never returned, not even the simple oil/vinegar. When the server finally stopped by (after flagging the hostess for oil/vinegar, she was at least quick to return) we mentioned there was no steak. Most of use had almost finished by the time the steak arrived. No real apology and definitely no offer to compensate for the mistake. Overall an average experience, wouldn't plan to go back or commend unless looking to stope in for a drink.",

My GF had the banana stuffed french toast and I think it changed my life it was so good. I went ahead and ordered their breakfast burrito that was made vegetarian sans the bacon. It was divine. Their breakfast potatoes are KILLER. Furthermore, they now are offering $14 bottomless mimosas.   I am not a big South Side guy, but golly, if you're down there at weekend brunch time. Do it to it. Also, upstairs rooftop seating FTW.",

    "text": "I'd only give it one if I didn't frequent here so often because of the large operable windows that make the place great to hang out and have a few beers one a nice afternoon or evening.  If your only going for a lite beer on a nice evening, you can't go anywhere better.  Most of the bar staff is super, except for the one rude waitress that laughed when I asked for a Harp on St. Patrick's Day last year. \"I'm not going to order a case of Harp that nobody will drink and go bad!\"  Last time I checked a lot of people enjoy Harp and all Guinness products especially on St. Patrick's day.  It took awhile, but the place finally has a decent beer selection (not great).  I would only suggest ordering beer here because the the wine selection is terrible and the mixed drinks are the worst on the Southside.  My guess is the ownership monitors the bartender's pours because they are always too weak.  And by weak I mean you may as well just order a tonic water instead of an G&T because all you're going to get is tonic water.  Recently they started wine night Wednesdays where you get 1/2 price bottles of wine.  When I was there recently on one of these nights I asked for a wine list, which they didn't have, so I asked for a bottle of Pinot Noir.  The wine was not corked or anything, but it was so bad tasting that I couldn't even finish half a glass.  The food isn't all that bad, but isn't anything special.  My only advice is to avoid the fish sandwich...it made me sick one time",

We were also sitting by the window and the AC was blowing strait down on us. I guess they had an AC issue and hadn't finished the duct work. So all of the air was blowing down on our corner. That being said, we could have asked to move. So that is on us. Then we tried the flatbread and the dough wasn't fully cooked. We didn't eat it. Because of the groupon we had to get to $30 in food. The apps were half off so we were $10 short. Then we tried the Cuban sandwich. That was ok. It wasn't very big but considering the quality of the other food, it was a star. Beer was cold and the bloody mary was good. That's the only reason for 2 stars. We will not be back.",

Have never had a horrible experience, though can say I've never had a great one either. Service/food/prices are all average and never felt the need to leave a review. That is until this past weekend. I don't go out weekend nights in south side as I'm not a fan of the immature crowd, but it was a friends birthday so decided to go along. It was 2 am and the bar was closing, so I understand the staff is tired and wants everyone out so may yell some disrespectful things to get the people moving. But for a bouncer to aggressively push me from behind while I'm already ready walking towards the door is completely uncalled for.  There was no altercation prior to this, lights came on, I waited for my friend to go bathroom, then we headed out while trying to book an uber. While leaving the staff acted like herder dogs funneling everyone to the door. The was when the bouncer pushed me from behind and through me out the door. Completely uncalled for and a reason for me to never return to this establishment",

I wouldn't order any eggs from this place if you like them over easy or over medium, the cook can't figure out how to cook the whites but leave the yellow. Two times this has happened, I couldn't even eat them, you could see the uncooked whites. Gross.

I absolutely love the decor -- I think it's very warm and inviting and reflective of its Pittsburgh location.  The happy hour was held on the rooftop deck, which is now covered and has heaters for the wintertime. I was concerned that I was not dressed very warmly for the cooler space, but the temperature was still warm enough for me. So don't be afraid to eat or drink up there during the winter months!  I was really impressed by the service. Within the first 10 minutes of walking in, I had three different employees come up to me offering to get me and my friends drinks. Even when the room became packed, I was still checked on several times over the hour or two that I was there. However, their beer selection seemed a bit limited... I asked for both Sam Adams Oktoberfest and Yuengling, and was told that they did not have either. (I actually now question this because their online menu says that they should have Yuengling.)  They had long tables filled with pizzas, chips, dips, etc. for the happy hour. Sadly, the room was so packed that I didn't even check out all the food since people were blocking some of the tables. I just tried their cheese pizza and chips with queso. The cheese pizza was cold, which was somewhat understandable considering the temperature of the space was pretty cool. However, the chips and queso were very good, and the queso was still a warm temperature. Even though I've had very limited exposure to the food, it was good enough that I would like to come back and try more!",

Very cool atmosphere, especially in the summer so the rooftop bar is open (not entirely rooftop - it is enclosed, which is actually really nice when it is the middle of August). Lots of beer choices, but as a non-beer drinker, I wish there were more cocktail choices that weren't full of Red Bull. May visit again to try the brunch specials.",

When we asked her an update on the food she said it's coming. We got a quesadilla, lets be real it doesn't take over an hour to make a quesadilla. What bothered me more was her attitude. She kept ignoring us when we tried to get her attention and when we finally got to ask her about it all she could say was its coming.",

    "text": "Local, we finally went in. It was a Friday night and a little busy. I ordered the burger with cheese on buttered brioche. It was a pretty decent burger and good size as well. I ordered a salad to go with my burger. I was surprised at how fresh the salad was, and the tomatoes were nice and ripe. I had the white lightning beer, it was really good. I could not order a wine, they only offered cheap wine by the glass.   I did not know that they had rooftop seating until I looked at the website, I will definitely go in this summer and sit up on the rooftop and have a beer and split a burger with my husband. The burger we had was way too much food for me.   The server was very attentive but she was also very forgetful, Michelle said be nice but... She forgot our waters, she brought my husband a 16 ounce beer instead of a 25 ounce beer, she offered me balsamic dressing and brought me ranch, she forgot the mayo for my burger, she charged my husband for two 25 ounce beers when he only had the 16 ounce beers, she kind of argued about the price on the bill but then took care of it. She just needs to take a look at the table and pay attention to details and she will be a better server.   When my son comes to visit in the summer we will go in and sit on the rooftop and have a beer.",

I tried e Shocktop Twisted Pretzel (kinda watery and flavorless) and my go to Leinenkugel Cranberry Ginge Shandy. My fiance had the Strongbow cider. Select apps were half off and we got the pretzel sticks and pierogies. Both were fabulous and left us too full for dinner. The pretzels are served with honey mustard and cheese. The pieogies have sauerkraut, kielbasa and onions on them topped with sour cream.  We put in a to go order for our entrees and got a side salad, boneless wings and a flatbread pizza. The takeout did not stay good for long so  it would have been best to have just eaten the dinner there. Our fantastic waitress, Amanda, talked us into the pretzel brownie which was to die for - a fudge brownie with whipped cream, chocolate sauce and crushed up pretzels.  A great dinner and we will be sure to be back.",

The brunch is perfect for an every-week kinda thing.  Nothing special, but super tasty and the prices are ridiculously reasonable.  Carafes of mimosas for $8?  Uh, yeah.    The upstairs patio is so wonderful on a beautiful morning or evening, and is incredibly spacious.  The servers are ALL wonderful.  Every one.  Been here probably 30 times and never had bad service.  The manager works his butt off.  You see him assisting the servers all the time. Major points for that.  The dinner menu is also fantastic, and they run good daily deals.  I have also never ever waited for a table.  Keep it up, Local.  Lindsay and Joe love you.",

It came with breakfast potatoes and asparagus. My boyfriend agreed, he needed more food after his meal as well. They have a Bloody Mary bar and  mimosas pitcher, probably the best part! The environment was super chill; we were seated upstairs on a retro themed deck. I can see this being an awesome bar to bring friends that visit. I can't wait to be back for dinner and night life!",

The upstairs rooftop is great, giant ceiling fan to keep things cool, the Yinzerita machine running all day long, sun-shine central and hopefully not too many sloppy southsiders.  Downstairs I love the full length open windows that fall out onto Carson street and attentive bartenders. The servers, are a bit slow and the food is decent. Last I was here was for my birthday in August and I had the Mexican War Streets burger with a side of awesomely crispy onion rings. A guac surprise is my favorite kind of surprise.  The barlist gets better seasonally, but here we still cater to drunk young crowd, so yinzeritas and bud lights it is. Sigh. If you have one of their ampd cards [use at any Ampd location] you get a meal here free each year. I'll take it. All in all it's fine enough, but the service is pretty slow. I can think of better places to go in the Southside.   Also - I wish they would bring back their Black and Gold pizza they had when they first opened. It was BOMB.",

    "text": "Local Bar + Kitchen (henceforth referred to as \"the Local,\" or \"Local\") is a groovy place to dine and drink, friends. I was out and about one day with the old ball and chain. We were on our way to Carson Street Deli when we passed Local. It looked interesting. They had their sandwich board out that bragged about their cheap wing night. We made a note to go visit next time around.  So a short time passes, and I'm perusing the local deals on Groupon. Lo and behold, there's a dealio for $30 worth of food at the Local for a mere $19. Toss on an extra 20% off coupon and we're checking the joint out for 15 bucks and change. Can't beat that to try out a place you've never been. I buy that bad boy deal and off we go. We're headed to Local in all of it's Sou'side glory.  We decided to sit upstairs, which is going through a renovation to make it look more like a beer garden. They must be done with most of the work, as the room was nice and airy with a great view looking out at the city and some giant fan in the ceiling that was moving their air around like it was nothing. Well, I suppose it was nothing, but the size of the fan was impressive. That's my point there. Go up there just to check out that fan, kids.  There were smokers upstairs and that was a little bit of a bummer at first, but that GIANT FAN I was talking about in the previous paragraph wiped out that smoke pretty well. Like it was nothing, even. Man, that fan was cool. Literally. Anyway, we sat down and ordered some beverages and our dinners. My other half got The Steelworker, which consists of the Local's four cheese mac and cheese smashed between two burger patties, which is then wrapped in bacon, deep fried in Arsenal cider batter, and topped with queso fresco and a jalapeno relish. It was cray, as the kids say. She enjoyed it muchly.   I tried some of the wings, which were top notch. They were of the \"blondie\" variety, which our waitress didn't seem to know much about, but her basic description made them sound tasty. They were a little bit spicy and a little bit tangy and 100% AWESOMESAUCE. After that, we finished up with a couple slices of the chocolate cake and it, too was a real groove.  We just went back a second time this week. We sat downstairs this time. I had the triple decker reuben, which may rank as one of the best of that sandwich I've ever had. The corned beef on the samitch is really thin, and there was the perfect amount of kraut, cheese, and thousand island on top. You could taste every layer of the sandwich, with no one ingredient taking over any of the others. The bread it was served on was also killer  Did I mention the French onion soup? Well not I have. Terrific stuff, let me tell you. The cheese has that nice, unending pull away from the top and the bread and broth below it are superb. It has a very rich quality to it, which I liked a lot. The onions themselves were melt in your mouth goodness.  As for Mrs. Jason T., she tried the beef brisket. And while I was reeling in the thrills of my reuben, after having a taste of that brisket samitch, I knew what I would be getting on our next visit. The bbq sauce on it was mind bendingly good. And I love a good bbq samitch. I usually opt for pulled pork, but the beef here on this item of awesome was impeccable. How do they do it? I have no idea.  The staff is friendly and attentive. During our last visit, one of the managers came around to check on us regularly and also delivered some of the food. There's awlays good music playing, plenty of TVs to catch the games on if that's your thing, and a groovy view of Carson Street so you can always people watch if you're near the front of the joint.  So that's the Local for you. It's excellent and well worth the money with or without a Groupon special. Next time around we've thought about trying the mac and cheese appetizer just as an entree because the pictures of the thing make it look ginormous. It probably is. I'll look forward to it and that brisket.",

Of the 5 dishes I tried (3 were my friends), all were very good. I will admit that my burger was the best I've had on Carson St, over the last 5 years of visiting for business.       My favorite combo was the Red Sky at Night Beer and the Buffalo Chicken Dip. Spicy Food and Strong Beer. Yes I like strong beer.       If your not drinking 7%+ beer you should be in diapers. They do have weaker brews but why waste your money. Drink strong and spend less.      I will be back here every year that I get to visit. It's just a good comfortable place to eat, hangout and enjoy friends or chill out by yourself.       It's a really nice place with good food and good service.",

Our bartender was very unenthused and didn't seem to know how to crack a smile. I felt like we were bothering the kid the whole time. We ordered spinach artichoke dip as a starter, and a caeser salad with steak plus a Greek salad as entrees. The salads were ok but the one was loaded in dressing, the steak was cold on the caesar. I get that it's a salad but how did they make the steak cold, I've never had that outside of a convienence store. Did they cook it yesterday? Then we got our appetizer, about 10 minutes after our entrees. Our spinach artichoke dip lacked only two things, spinach and artichoke. It was just cheese and cream. At least the pita was good. Our bartender never once apologized, oh well, I guess they just aren't built for lunch, or food.",
