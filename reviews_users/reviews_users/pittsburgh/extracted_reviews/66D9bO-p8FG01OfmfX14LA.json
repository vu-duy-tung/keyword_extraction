My son had a super burgher. Yeah right.  It looked more like a slider. There was no fries, slaw nothing. Not even any condiments even on the burgher. We had to put those on at home. REALLY.  Sorry folks you have really gone down hill.",

    "text": "I would suggest avoiding this place at all costs. Me and my partner decided to bring a friend here for dinner, on our way home. We had been to this Eatn Park several times, and frequent the one in our town. This entire experience was completely horrid. We waited over fifteen minutes after being seated, finally after continuously looking around I was able to gain the attention of a staff member. She apologized, it seems our original waitress whom was supposed to take care of our table, did not want to. Although the original waitress named Sheryl was happy to wait on the tables around us. Towards the end of our meal, we overheard her making derogatory remarks to a busboy whom was African American. (Our friend whom we had taken to dinner, is also African American) after putting two and two together, this entire situation made sense. After she had made the comments, not two minutes later a manager was talking to the gentlemen bussing tables, I assume Sheryl had told the manager something. I was able to gain her attention and explained the situation of how we were ignored. She offered a 20% reduction of the bill. This establishment has left a horrible taste in my mouth. And I do not plan on returning to any Eatn Parks in the future. The waitress who actually waited on us, and whom continually apologized was quite nice and friendly, but sadly the damage was already done. I was unable to enjoy my meal whatsoever.",

I admit, our first choice was the Denny's down the street but it was gone!  What?? So, next best thing - Eat n Park!  We timed it perfectly.  Seated right away - NICE! Just before 11:00 am when they change from the breakfast bar to the brunch bar and the place gets bombarded from the church crowd.   Me; French Toast Smile - Sausage Wife: Pancake Smile - Sausage  Service - eh, the lady was nice but was obviously working a lot of tables.  Strange though, there were Eat n Park employees running around everywhere! If you've never watched them switch out the buffet, they are quite efficient at it.  One minute fruit and eggs, the next, fried chicken and pasta!  The sausage, so not good that we didn't finish eating it.  Who doesn't finish their sausage!!!!!   The eggs - perfect. Over medium, hot, nice.  Pancakes and French Toast - not hot, no flavor. very bland.   Syrup - yuk. odd flavor and thin.   Me: French Toast Frown - mystery meat Wife: Pancake Frown - mystery meat  Watching the switching of the buffet from breakfast to brunch plus hot eggs cooked to order = 2 stars.",

    "text": "No wonder my husband never brings us here. Never again. I swear. I'll eat cereal at home instead.  If I were allowed to give zero stars, I would.   The hostess couldn't find a clean table at which to seat us. That should have been the first clue that we were in trouble.  I passed by the salad bar on my way to our table. They were out of just about everything.  Guess I won't order salad bar. Second clue.  The man at the table next to us was complaining to a manager about waiting. Third clue.  Add to this the fact that the kids at the booth behind us were screaming and telling their parents to shut up. Par for the course at an establishment of this caliber.   It took 15 minutes for our waitress to even appear.   We finally got our drinks after 29 minutes at the table. She brought a few of the accessories- cole slaw, some dinner rolls. She walked away with my iced tea though. And we still had no silverware.  That took another 10 minutes.   40 minutes into my Eat n Park experience and the two tables on my right are still dirty, as is the floor. (See picture)  My son said his chocolate milkshake was pretty good despite the fact that they screwed up and brought it with whipped cream and a cherry after I specifically requested that they leave those off.    43 minutes and counting. No food yet. Our server,  Lori, just explained something about putting a big tickets for another group through before ours. Whatever. Thanks for trying to make your problems mine.     They just bussed and cleaned the 2 dirty tables next to me. Not the floor though. Used napkins and straw wrappers and fries and all.  48 minutes. No food. And we're all out of drinks.   Food arrived after 50 minutes at the table. It was just ok. My Nantucket cod looked like it had been baking under the warmer for a while. (See picture) It was pretty tasty, I will admit. They forgot my mother's garlic bread.   59 minutes in, the waitress reappeared with one drink refill but none for the rest of our table. We asked about the garlic bread. Hmm. She was surprised we didnt have it and blamed it on the kitchen (but they aren't the ones who bring out our meals....)   1 HR and 13 minutes. The waitress brought our check and the missing garlic bread.   I just realized that she never brought my son his french fries at all.  She was nice enough to bring my 2 kids free Smiley cookies even though they are too old for the kids menu.   At the register,  I asked to speak to the manager.  He apologized up and down. I told him that this was the worst Eat n Park experience I've ever had. I'm not one to complain but I work in a service industry and this was just horrible on every account. He discounted our bill by half. Not completely acceptable but whatever. He tried to tell me that they never get this busy. I kindly explained that, since there was no line waiting to be seated like there is on weekends and this was not during the actual dinner rush (it's 8:10pm) I doubt that what he's saying is True and he needs to get a grip and have a serious conversation with his staff, especially Lori the air headed server.   Tonight was the last time I will ever eat at the Robinson Twp Eat n Park.",

First, although most of the place looks clean, I noticed a lack of urgency in bussing tables when it's not busy at all late at night.  Second, they seem to be out of basic stuff like onions and other things (a big step down on the burger).  And, the \"super burger\" isn't that super: two thin patties, and three slices of bun bread.  Nothing special, and it's too pricy for what it is.  I doubt it's better in general than Denny's.  Also, no longer 24 hours (the main reason to go here).",

    "text": "I went to the Eat'n Park in Robinson last Saturday.  Overall it was a good experience.  When I arrived, I had a short wait at the host stand while the hostess seated someone who arrived just before I did.  They sat me at a table where some guests had just left.  They cleared and cleaned the table quickly, and I sat down.  Shortly after, the server took my order.  I ordered the Original Superburger Deal.  After a short wait, my food came, although I was missing the lemonade that I ordered.  The waitress stopped by rather promptly and, without my asking, informed me that she would be right back with my lemonade.  The Superburger is based off the Big Boy (Eat'n Park used to be affiliated with Frisch's Big Boy).  It is similar to a Big Mac, only the quality is 100 times better, it has two pickle chips on top, and instead of \"Special Sauce\" it has \"Sauce Supreme,\" which is a little bit different.  The fries were delicious, and the lemonade was good.  For dessert, I ordered the pie of the month, which was a Pumpkin Creme Pie.  It was delicious.  It tasted like it sounds, a cross between pumpkin pie and a creme pie.  It was definitely more creamy than pumpkiny.  I then went to pay my tab at the cashier, and I picked up a box of Pittsburgh Pirates Smiley Cookies, as well.  Smiley cookies taste like typical box frosted sugar cookies, but they are just part of the Eat'n Park experience.  It is always a joy to have one, especially the special edition ones.  Just like the hostess and the waitress, the cashier was very friendly. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Eat'n Park in Robinson.  The guest service was excellent and I was pleased with both the price and how quickly they got me in and out.  I would definitely consider dining here again the next time I am in Robinson, or at any other Eat'n Park that I'm near.",

This review has nothing whatsoever to do with the service or the staff, (who were very pleasant and competent by the way) actually the staff is probably the reason this isn't a one star review.  The food itself was very poorly prepared. My friend got an omelet and hash browns and the omelet looked like it was made of wax. The hash browns went untouched as they seemed to be taken straight from the frozen, shrink wrapped packaging and popped in the microwave for 20 seconds.   The restaurant wasn't very clean and our table was sticky when we sat down. I mean if you're going to eat at this level you'd do much better at IHOP or even Waffle House. I think the only way I see myself ever coming back is if I am stranded in a desert and come across one in a small oasis...even then... :/",

She was busting her ass after being sat 10 times in a very small time period by a manager that couldn't care less. This caused a long wait which wasn't that big of a deal but still. She was blonde and wasn't wearing a name tag, probably because she knew she was doing a terrible job. She clearly cut all her servers before the post Steelers game rush had happened. I had the chicken sandwich which was meh, they forgot the tomato on it but that's not what made it bad. Someone else in my group had a fish sandwich. Sandwiched between a French roll that may have taken a 6 month boat ride from France to here due to how hard the bread was. We were gonna feed it to the birds but we didn't wanna break any beaks. At the end of our meal it was the lazy manager who was asked if she could close us out due to how busy the server was. We were polite about the situation considering how truly awful our experience was. We told her about the bread and she didn't even ask if she could do anything. I know that they probably deal with shitty complaints from cheap clientele but the issues we had were simply inexcusable for a 30 dollar meal. Jess should go across the street to industry public house or anywhere where they care about hospitality.",

Eh, no such luck. It looks like an office building as you drive up to it. When you enter, it looks like...another EnP. Hurm.   EnP's can be befuddling, at least with me. I swear that the food and service is better at some locations than at others. Then again, I've also found that it depends on what you order and when you go.   Late last night, Kay and I stopped in for supper.   Ariel, our server, was proficient and chipper, so I won't (nor can one under any circumstances) hold the dry, tasteless BBQ Cheddar Bacon Burger (or whatever they call it) against her. Hey, I hadn't tried it before. Maybe I should have stuck with the Superburger, but as a reviewer, I have a duty, y'know?  Nonetheless, the cole slaw was up to the usual above average standard, and the slice of green pistachio pie (only offered in the month of March) that I shared with Kay was creamy, nutty, Celtic (?) satisfaction.",

Service was amazing and entertaining.  She never missed a beat and always had something fun to say.  This place, even in the middle of the night, was fairly busy.  Well maintained as well.  The only thing weird about this place is the location.  It's not a stand alone restaurant like others.  It is the bottom floor of a small office building.  It just looks odd from the outside.",

You can't expect the utmost best from Eat'n Park nowadays, but you cannot go wrong with the salad bar, breakfast, and desserts! I think I enjoy coming here so much because it's sort of nostalgic in a way, and it's been the same forever. I love their breakfast items like the griddle smile and all American scrambler. The salad bar is always fresh, and they even have a late night breakfast buffet on Saturday nights.   I will say the prices have generally gone up a lot recently. I think it's almost $10 to get the salad bar, which is way more than it used to be. I usually stick with the breakfast items because they're more reasonably priced anyways. You also can't go wrong with the strawberry pie! The service at this location can sometimes be hit or miss, but tonight we had a great experience!",

Too often the back of the house doesn't receive credit for a good dining experience and this staff deserves credit they were awesome. No mistakes and everything tasted fresh and great. The best part was they let us just stay and hang. We were gathered for the funeral of a wonderful woman who was our sister, aunt, Godmother, and grandmother being able to sit talk, eat, laugh and cry was so perfect. Leigh made sure our drinks were full and we wanted for nothing all the while being very unobtrusive. Thank you so much for all you did.",

The smiley cookies alone are super nostalgic and remind me of all the times I came here with my family when I was a kid. I still love Eat'n Park just as much, and this location has treated me well each time I've visited it.  The salad bar at Eat'n Park has always been one of my favorites. They feature a rotating selection of soups, fruit, muffins, salad, etc. It won't break the bank, either, as my boyfriend and I each got an appetizer along with the salad bar for under $30. You can't beat it! The appetizer portions were big enough to be the perfect meal with a cup of soup and a salad. We went on a Sunday, and the soup of the day is potato soup, which is my absolute favorite soup here. They also have potato soup on Wednesdays, and on the Sunday we visited they also had classic chicken noodle. My boyfriend was kind of bummed they didn't have chili because that's his favorite, but maybe next time!  For our appetizers, we got the mac and cheese bites and fried zucchini. The portion of fried zucchini we got was enormous! It was more than enough for two people to share, and then some! The mac and cheese bites are a newer addition to the Eat'n Park menu, and they were also pretty good. Our waiter was quick to take our order and our food arrived right after we got our first go at the salad bar.  Overall, we had a great experience here. Everything tasted awesome, especially that famous potato soup! The service was fast and friendly, and we even decided to take an apple pie home to enjoy for dessert. Eat'n Park's slogan is \"The Place for Smiles,\" and our visit to the Robinson location definitely left us smiling!",

I know, stuff happens (but I've never seen this at any other restaurant, ever).  Eat 'n Park features it's soup and salad bar, right?  Well, these folks closed it down while changing over from Bruch to Lunch/Dinner.  Having just bought it as park of my lunch, what was I to do?  It takes them 30 minutes to change it over.  They let me make a salad (they were out of soup, or took it away), but I did so in the DARK (lights off means \"bar closed,\" apparently).  So it's decent, no real problems, just a bit weird.",

To give us our drinks, ask if we are ready, ask for boxes and to pay for our check. I had to ask another waitress named Jen behind us for silverware...I was waiting for him to return to the table to ask for creamer and he didn't come back until he seen I was going to ask the waitress for it and even then I still didn't get a drink because he left as fast as he came. All I wanted was a DP because my mouth was so dry as is. By the time I got my drink i couldn't even eat my stickies or potato's because they were cold. I never give bad reviews but today I just had to leave one because I didn't want a scene in the restaurant. My advice to Sam is to go through training again on customer service because we didn't receive it today. I do know what it's like in the industry as I have 3 years customer service myself so I try to be understanding but there's no reason as to why we were barely waited on. We sat for almost 30 minutes waiting on a check and have been here for almost a hour and a half. Like I said I love Eat'n Park but today was not the day. If I could've tipped anyone, it would've been Jen. You go! Thank you for taking the time out to wait on us Jen. Btw Sam didn't have that many tables to wait on and he kept waiting on the same ones....it's like he forgot about us...in the beginning as well the lady in the back was messing with cookies without gloves. There's a window you could see into the back and she literally had nooooo gloves on yet you want us to eat your cookies. I'm very disappointed and hope that management can fix these minor issues that can potentially become big issues.",

If I'm drunk, maybe this would be a good place to go but I'd be able to find something tastier at a McDonalds with 1/4 the cost.  Poor service with sub-par food at best.

    "text": "This chain that I have only seen in Pittsburgh seems a little like Denny's, but I like it better. It's a 24 hour restaurant with a pretty large menu. They also sell some pies from their front counter.   I think it's a good spot for breakfast. They have pretty decent coffee, service is quick and friendly and he food is hearty.   I got the Original Breakfast Smile, which comes with eggs, choice of bacon or sausage, toast and choice of potatoes. I got sausage, which was the weakest part.  The patties were kind of wet and a little greasy. I really liked their home fries, though, and the portion size was pretty large. The scrambled eggs were cooked just fine.   There is a small counter area where I say and got quick service. The restaurant is mainly booths and tables. There was a television behind the counter with the news on, so I could catch up on local happenings.   Prices are good. I would come back, maybe not for dinner but for breakfast  or lunch.",
