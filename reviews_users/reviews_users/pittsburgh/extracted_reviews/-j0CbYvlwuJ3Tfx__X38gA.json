We reserved the 3rd floor which they call The Lodge. There were just ten of us ladies but it could have seated double. It was private and cozy. Our server was Erin (not sure of spelling). She was friendly, timely and patient. As I said it was on the 3rd floor so up and down she went. We had zucchini,  meatballs, salad, pasta, filet, crab cakes. Everything was delicious, fresh and authentic. No Olive Garden here. No sir. This is the real thing. Price is worth it. You'll see why when you get there. Just get there.",

They say they are broiled but come to table like they were defrosted in microwave ...so is the sesame calamari bad. Can u even tell its calamari. . Veal chop was ok. Chef has a chip on his shoulder and can't admit his food sucks big time. Wait staff is very good but too bad they have to put up with a chef that has a big ego and can't cook to save his life. Don't send the bad food back .... They make u pay for it anyway. There may be few choices in Pittsburg but pass on this one. Don't let the nice ambiance fool u",

The crab balls were filled with crab and the sauce was just wonderful. I got the filet, which was a bit charred on the outside, but all in all, was pretty good. The pasta side was a creamy tomato basil sauce. The pasta was a little dry and could have used more sauce (And I usually like very light sauce).  I probably would try something else next time. My boyfriend got Mafalda Caprese, which was so flavorful. We ended with tiramasu, which was the best I've ever had. Our waiter, Adam, was friendly, professional and made our experience wonderful. This is a great place to have a date night. I can't wait to return.",

I also love that it is pretty old school Pittsburgh, what with the \"older\" crowd and decor.  The chef even comes out to everyone to say hi and to ask if they enjoyed their meal!  Classy.  The food is fabulous.  I had the skirt steak, which was the size of my face, I kid you not.  Sometimes, size compensates for other things, but my friends, this was a serious steak.  Absolutely delicious.  I think I managed to finish only about half of it, which is understandable given that I also had a salad and a pasta course (all included in the meal) beforehand.  I also want to give a shout out to the pasta course - it was delicious the night of, and when I had the leftovers, it was even better.    We weren't able to deal with any dessert since we were pretty much popping out of our pants by the end of the night, but now that I know, I'm going to try and pace myself a little better next time.  I'm salivating already.",

The chef comes out and introduces himself frequently to patrons.  They will even do special orders for you if you have a request,  the couple next to us were able to split an entree and have an item prepared not on the menu without any problem.  You just don't see service and personalized approach to food like this anymore, especially at nicer restaurants.  The food was excellent from start to finish with a garlic sundried tomato olive oil served with the bread.  I had their Caesar salad and my partner had the house salad - both were fantastic and were meals in their own right.  The Caesar was lightly dressed with full flavor.    The meals came with a pasta tasting course which was with a tomato basil light cream sauce, which we could not get enough of... It's a nice touch to have a separate pasta course, which really makes the experience.  The chicken Romano is wonderfully prepared with a light coating and robust Romano cheese flavor.  One of the specials was a black cod served with Israeli cous cous, which was similarly fantastic.  The cod was so flavorful and fresh and melted on the palate.  Last was the dessert - a New York style cheesecake with beery sauce.  It was fantastic and the best cheesecake we've ever had, including those in New York.  We will surely be coming back soon and often.",

We alternate between ordering the pasta as an entree and getting a full entree and taking most of the pasta home.  Either way way are happy and full.  The veal chop might be the best entree in town and the seafood melissa is a wonderful and lighter dish.  The sleeper of the menu is the escarole and white bean w sausage appetizer.

First, it's in an entire house - how awesome can it be? We were greeted by the staff and told we were the first ones of the night and they were gonna take extra care of us. But of course they took extra care of EVERYONE, but it's okay!  Had the fish and the chicken specials of the day.  This meal included soup or salad + pasta + entree.  This was way too much food - at the end, we couldn't even get dessert. But everything was delicious - especially the chicken! Oh my, so tender and soft and yummy. Each part of the meal was perfectly made. Would definitely come again on special occasions!",

    "text": "Just blocks from the zoo is this authentic Italian restaurant in a converted house.    If you are going to part with a C-note (which you will likely do here, unless you are dining alone) this is a pretty good place to do it.  YOU WILL NOT GO HOME HUNGRY (see my review of Salt of the Earth).  And, overall, the food is pretty darn good, the staff and chef are friendly, and the atmosphere festive but refined.  As for the food... the bread and oil/garlic/white bean mix are a nice free starter.  As an app, we tried the smoked salmon plate w/ toasted pita-like bread, capers, chopped onions, chopped egg... The salmon was plentiful, and overall, the dish was fresh and tasty and a good starter.  Then, we tried the soup (chicken pasta, tonight) and an upgraded salad w/ candied walnuts, sliced apples, greens, crumbled, cheese... both were excellent.  For entrees (which, by the way, range from $25-$40, but come with soup or salad and a pasta \"taster\" on the side -- which you can upgrade w/ a meatball the size of a baseball for only $2 -- more on that later) ... I tried a Mediterranean-style turbot special, and my wife had the crab cakes.  Her crab cakes were good, though not great - though I ate almost half of them.  Kudos to the right mix of crab, breadcrumbs, and seasoning.  My fish was well-prepared, plentiful, and smartly prepared with the white fish soaking up many of the Mediterranean elements of the dish (olive oil, olives, sun dried tomatoes).    ... the pasta sides -- an apparent staple of Tambelinnis -- are excellent.  The tomato basil cream sauce they come in (though you can also just get marinara, or just tomato basil) is outstanding, and my wife's meatball upgrade was the star of the show.  Just in that $2 upgrade there was more substance and flavor than our entire C-note blowing at Salt of the Earth a few weeks ago...  ... a few oddities.  We were sitting near the kitchen door, so we got a lot of \"staff\" action.  There was a lot of talk about how many tables everyone had/didn't have, and there were many near-misses -- and one hit -- via the in-and-out of the swinging kitchen door.  There are also a crazy number of options and specials, and so hearing the possibilities from your waiter can take a good deal of time.    Overall, however, the location is interesting; the people welcoming and friendly; and the food authentic, generous, and occasionally innovative.  For a hearty, interesting dinner experience - definitely give this Italian place a try.",

    "text": "I booked this dinner date with much anticipation. By the time the day arrived the air had been invaded by the shade of white. The roads were covered with a sloppy mess and I had been steamrolled by sickness. My anticipation had turned to worry and a medicated haze. Alas I arrived, in the entrance I handed a young women my coat but not before snagging the tissues from it. The room was filled with a cozy house like glow with warmth that seemed to dripping from the seams. I was seated along with my date near the entrance, my heart immediately was happy to be seated but my brain knew we would catch a slight draft from the outside world. I ignored the bittersweet island I had now made port with and focused on the drink list. I immediately spotted my wine of choice a Malbeck from the colorful plethora of alcohol choices. They said I shouldn't have more than three alchoholic beverages with my meds, I took that as an invitation to drink as if it was a good idea..  The appetizers seem to scream eat me so I couldn't deny my stomach and I went with the sauteed calamari. It was if the squid had decided that it's last dying wish was to appease some unaware future predator which happened to be me. It was excellent.   After the wikipedialike information filled specials list was sounded off by our waiter Nikki. I had decided to choose a steak smothered in mushrooms, it sounded most delicious. Unaware was I of one of the many things that makes Joeseph Tambellines so special is their weekly pasta dish that is served with every meal. I, a then fallen victim of oil and bread, calamari, the soup that came with my entree was now being faced with yet another course to battle with. The pasta was great and truly was surprising. By the time I had gotten to my entree I was struggling. I then with sad struggling eyes looked up...  There sat on a plate what seemed like half of a cow. The steak could have been mistaken for the size of a deflated basketball, a festival of meat disguised in the surface area of a sheet cake. I wanted to cry both in joy and and fear.   I attempted to conquer the beast but it was sadly beyond the likes of me. Soon after I was approach with the killing blow from Joseph Tambellines...dessert.  I offered up a treaty with my date as to share something since I was becoming lifeless due to the IV of solids I was unexpectedly hooked up to. We decided on the creme brulee and were very impressed. The flavors truly were captured, a fitting way to mark my food grave.  All in all, Joseph Tamebellines is an experience that must be taken one course at a time, with caution mind you. For those risk takers out there who love to test the limits of their ability to be overly satisfied, this is the place for you.",

    "text": "I have been to Tambellini's twice now.  The atmosphere there is great, and it's a very cool \"house\" conversion done right in to a restaurant which actually makes you feel like an Italian.    The first time I went with a group of people for dessert late on a Friday night.  Despite are semi-large group (8), the staff was very friendly to us and we all sat down and talked for a long time and throughout the 8 of us I think we had every dessert on the menu.  I had the Tiramisu and it was *excellent.*  It was a very large portion, and the flavors were very nicely spread throughout it.  It was not overly \"rummed\" but you could taste a good hint of it.  The cake was very moist.  I took a quick bite of several of the other desserts and they were also great.  All of us were very happy with the visit.  At some point, Joseph Tambellini came out and joked around with us and was friendly.  It was nice of him to come out and make us feel at home there.  The second time I went for a nice dinner with my girlfriend, and we had a very romantic and great meal.  I had a special of the day which was a Mediterranean inspired King Salmon, which was very nicely done and very tasty.  My salmon came with a side of pasta (in a separate bowl) which had a great homemade tomato sauce.  Even the salad of the day was a nice mixture of greens and the dressing was very good.  My girlfriend had a pasta with lobster and shrimp, and it was also very good.  I eat a lot of shrimp, and her shrimp was cooked to perfection.  It was not chewy at all.  We finished off our meal by sharing a tiramisu (inspired by my prior visit), and my girlfriend also loved it.  It's a great portion for two people to share (for a reasonable price) as a way to tip off a great meal.  I really liked this place.  It's a nice restaurant for a nice meal, friendly staff, and a romantic place.  It's not inexpensive, so it's not going to be a weekly or monthly visit... but if I'm to plan a romantic meal this will likely be a future revisit.",

To make things worse the side dishes of risotto and asparagus were also only a couple bites as well. The dish cost $47!!!! A total ripoff for the tiny amount of food. Bringing it to the waiter and managers attention did no good at all.  After reading this review, the owner contacted me and was very helpful in attempting to correct my bad experience.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I recently discovered the restaurants of Bryant Street via The Smiling Banana Leaf, and have been looking for an excuse to try out Joseph Tambellini's ever since we saw the quaint, homey-looking facade.  We'd heard that Tambellini's serves up some seriously amazing Italian fare, so we jumped at the chance to take the bf's Italian food-loving parents here on their most recent visit to the 'Burgh.  We decided to invite my parents along too and make it a big family get-together.    Our last family dinner had taken place at another popular Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh, Alla Famiglia, so I was curious to see how the two would compare.  In my opinion, Joseph Tambellini's was far superior to Alla Famiglia.  Each entree comes with a soup or house salad, as well as a bowl of homemade pasta.  I had low expectations for my house salad, but was pleasantly surprised to receive a vibrant and delicious salad dressed in a raspberry vinaigrette.  I'm not normally a big fan of pasta, but I cleaned my bowl of home-made pasta, served in a light tomato basil cream sauce.  The portions were just the right size, satisfying but still left me with an appetite for my entree.    I completely loved my eggplant parmesan.  The eggplant was cooked perfectly and wasn't too heavy on the marinara or cheese.  I split this dish with my mother, who ordered the Seafood Melissa: a lightly breaded piece of white fish, served with scallops and crab-meat stuffed shrimp.  Although I did not really care for the scallops, I enjoyed the other components of the dish.  My boyfriend ordered the broiled lobster tails, and declared that they were the best lobster tails he'd ever had.    Even though we were all satisfied at this point, we couldn't pass up on dessert.  Our party went with the tiramisu, creme brulee, and pecan ball.  The tiramisu was AMAZING. I could have selfishly inhaled the whole piece myself, but managed to pass it along for everyone else to try.  All in all, this was a fabulous meal.  If you're looking for timeless, traditional Italian food done right, this is your place.",

    "text": "Fresh Made Italian  As the title states, it is what it is. Great authentic Italian cuisine! We were out this evening exploring a new restaurant (we picked it from yelp), for our favorite smiling face, Tiffany (she got old today). Since our Princess, Tiffany, always wants to eat  Italian and always eats Bucca De Peppo, or whatever it is called. This Jedi is not down with the Bucca's & Olive Gardens of the world... this Jedi needs something fresh...not out of a bag.  I Started with upgrading the salad to a Caesar Salad...it's an Italian Joint you have to bang on a Caesar. And like I thought, a great homemade Caesar, with crisp romaine lettuce. The perfect amount of anchovy, superb!   I'm not big on eating pasta out..heavy+filling= sleepy. But Joseph's makes their or his own  pasta...I'm in. I went with the Tenne Shrimp & Jumbo Lump Crab. Mouthwatering... is what I have to say. The Shrimp huge and cooked perfect, the jumbo lump sweet and it is well balanced with a fresh stewed tomato basil cream sauce. The \"Tenne\" had me confused...for I have never heard of this pasta...it was triangle, penne to Tenne...very clever Joseph. The wifey went with the Veal Picatta... I'm not a big lemon caper butter sauce kinda guy... but his was definitely fresh as fresh could be, and the wife enjoyed. Tiffany went with the Chicken Picatta to mirror the veal, and she equally enjoined hers. Ritter went with a meatball dish with a small, very long,  lasagna noodle... very different. Also very fresh.  Now the delight of the night... Creme Burlee ... I LOVE CREME BURLEE. This was one of the best I have ever had. 2nd to only Emeril's himself. Touche Mr. Tamablini, you have opened a great restuarant. I will highly recommend and tell others to dine at your establishment.  JEDI RECOMMENDED  --- The fact that Tambelli's (Joseph's) is located in a old Pittsburgh Home....makes it well.......homey...",

The manager greeted me at the door and when I mentioned that I was with a group of 6 he became rather surly and complained that my friend had only called the night before for a table.  He also mentioned that the reservation was for 7 and I was the only one present.   I later spoke to the manager again to ask him if there was something that could have been done differently when making a reservation that would have suited him.  He mentioned that it is December, and they are very busy and that we took his last large group table.    Well....is that not what they are in business to do?  As far as group was concerned, the manner in which we were received combined with average food at a costly price confirmed that we would not be returning.",

    "text": "I must confess that I didn't go to Joseph Tambellini's for a long time despite it's very high Yelp rating because its website is so strange. There are photographs of each item on the menu, which made me think of it as some kind of Denny'sesque Italian restaurant. And the clientele, which is generally composed of dressed up grandparents. But itching for something new, a group of my friends and I tried it last night.   It is a traditional upscale Italian restaurant with a great atmosphere, excellent service, a solid bar and wine list, but unadventurous entrees.  It's the Pamela's of upscale Pittsburgh restaurants. Each entree comes with a salad, which is good, and a somewhat bland tomato cream sauce pasta dish. My NY strip steak and a friend's pork chop were excellent, but friends who ordered the fish courses were not impressed.  Rat pack era music plays in the background.   The food will probably pleasing to most traditional Pittsburghers (particularly those who expect to eat a lot of food or are over 55 years old), but it is not particularly creative or exciting. If you do go there, order a steak and try to sub in one of the more unusual pastas (or take a look at the photos of all the entrees online before you go).",

I can't remember exactly what we all got but we shared an appetizer or two, and ordered entrees ranging from seafood to meat dishes.  All the food was very good and worth the price.  Mr. Tambellini even stopped by our table to make sure everything was going well.  Definitely a great experience!",

The signature meatball appetizer was generously portioned, and I liked the taste although I am not much of a meatball eater. We enjoyed the toppings, such as fruits and nuts, on our house salads. My husband liked his shrimp scampi entree. My chicken parmesan was a large size, and I liked the tender chicken with crispy breading. The chocolate lava dessert did not have a melted, fudgy center as the menu said, but I liked its ice cream topping, as well as the candle that they inserted for my birthday. I felt that the business valued me as a customer. Parking is free across the street if you get a parking pass from the business.",

    "text": "Rick brought me here for my Valentine's Night dinner on Saturday, February 18.  Yes, four days later.  Unfortunately I had to be out of town, San Antonio to be exact for two weeks and that included Valentine's Day.    But O did he promise me a really nice dinner when I returned!  Their menu promises \"Warm romantic fine dining in the True Tambellini family tradition.\" and they are not kidding.    We began our dinner with some antipasta--sauteed calamari.  Hey, I'm 50% Italian and my guy is 100%.  We both love a great calamari and I'd been craving it since San Antonio.  This was the sort of calamari that just slowly melts in your mouth as you eat it, it was that succulent.  For my insalate I went for the mozzarella salad-- fresh mozzarella, tomato, oasted peppers and mixed greens.  Heavenly!    One thing that sets Joseph Tambellini apart from some of the others is that they make their own pasta by hand here.  And believe me, it shows folks.  Their  Mafalda Caprese was like none I've ever had before.  The grilled chicken was just right, the tomatos fresh, and the garlic not overpowering.  Rick went for the veal chop which just smelled divine!  This thing was a 16-oz'er and he ended up bringing some of it home.    Ah, but what is an Italian dinner without Dolce?  They've got a butterscotch poundcake with vanilla bean ice cream, and candied pecans with butterscotch sauce.  Oh how tempting that looked, but just a bit much.  Rick and I split a wonderful cannoli though, which topped off that dinner perfectly.    The atmosphere and service here are just impeccable.  Joseph Tambellini has three floors, each with a different decor.  Rick got us a table on the first floor, which has a much more traditional setting--just the way I like it.    So my Valentine's Day was a little delayed. But with that dinner, it was s-o-o-o worth the wait.  And the night was still young too.",

We sat on the second floor which is not my preference because it's a little bit tight. Every time someone got up or wait or walk by I was always bumped each time when they walk by.  So if you can try to ask for the first floor or the back room on the first floor. Keep in mind there are three floors of the restaurant. As well as the outside deck which is my favorite in the summertime.  Our server was top notch and clearly it shows as he's been here for a long time. He always just knew the right things to say and when to come over at the exact right time. He never missed a beat  Tonight I wanted to crabcakes just to get something different and they were good.  We also had the fried zucchini which was quite standard. My wife had the veal chop which is out of this world. Even though they have a lot of other Italian inspired dishes. I think their best dishes are the veal chop or their Porkchop.  The cheesecake was also top-notch.  Overall a great restaurant.",

We were seated on the 3rd floor. Beautiful home, nice owners, and nice servers. However, does one dine for the atmosphere or food? I guess it's a combination and that's why I gave Tambellini's 2 stars instead of 1.  Among the many plates we ordered were the Sesame Calamari appetizer; Shrimp Scampi and Scallops for mains; and the standard pasta without meat and Cesar salads accompanied with those mains.   Sesame Calamari was overcooked and lacked flavor. This is coming from a family who has frequently enjoyed calamari over the years. The Shrimp Scampi was also overcooked, dry and lacking flavor. On the other hand, the Scallops main was undercooked and left that metallic aftertaste signaling they were spoiled. The standard pasta accompanying these dishes was served cold and slightly undercooked.   On the better side of the plates ordered at our table: the Fried Zucchini appetizer was good, and the Crab Balls appetizer was also very good. Salads ordered were good.  Other than that, none of the other plates my family members ordered were very memorable (We had a party of 5). We will not be returning.",

    "text": "My second time here was last night since I relocated to the Steel City from The Big Apple. In NYC, Italian is my second culture having many many Italian friends since childhood. That said, I'm super picky about my Italian having graced places like my very very favorite, Il Bagatto (read my Yelp on this place), Lil Charlie's (RIP), my second favorite, Il Mulino, Trattoria L'incontro in Astoria, Lenny's in Howard Beach, Nello's on the UES and even Rao's which I've had the pleasure of eating at twice.   With Tambellini, this is by far the BEST italian in Pittsburgh. I was impressed with the food. The fresh pasta is a hit the sauces and dressings are like they were straight from  Grandma Upstairs (my Italian \"grandmother\" may her soul rest in peace) kitchen, I haven't eaten meat in 8 years but I might just have relapse over some Tambellini meatballs.   While the decor is a bit old school, I don't mind. I just long for a room full of fun and interesting people, which Pittsburgh is sorely lacking. I miss eating and chatting up my neighbors and then sharing a Grappa or Limoncello with them. Maybe its because I have a huge personality with an AWESOME beard but the people in PGH are boring, although I did see a young dude in there with a 5 panel cap and a hip brand crew neck on. We need more of that swag in the Burgh.   The chef is a great guy, he and his wife make sure to greet each customer and chat them up. I like that, but sometimes it feels forced and I really wish I knew them more because they seem like really nice people but when they start with the small talk it pains me because we can't really delve into any conversation of substance. Maybe one day but until then, let's table the convo and let me get at the food!!",

    "text": "Good service and good food! Pricey but good. However, I am slightly tempted to give it a 3.75 star instead of 4. Read on to find out why!  My fiance and I came here for my birthday. And with my friend's recommendation from before I was excited and had high expectations. They were friendly when they greeted us at the door, and led us upstairs to our seats after taking our jackets. Very nice and professional service just as I expected. We came on a Wednesday so there weren't many people and I enjoyed the quietness.  Once we sat down we decided to start with some drinks. Since it was also around VDay, they had some yumm cocktails. I ordered on e and had a great time sipping on it. Would go try their other special cocktails again in the future. For appetizers, we got the crab salad and that was definitely delicious. And OmG in LOVE with their bread dipping sauce - Olive oil and garlic. Without a doubt one of the better ones I have had in the past. We did a soup and salad, they were good but nothing too outrageous for me to comment on.  Moving onto the entree, because I saw a lot of reviews raving about their tomato basil sauce I really wanted to try that but I also wanted to try a steak....dilemma.... But this part I really like about their menu offerings - if you order a special entree it comes with pasta with tomato basil sauce!! Bam!! Problem solved!! I got their special Delmonico steak with mushrooms on top. So here is where the 3.75 star comes in. Aside from the fact it was a nice piece of steak, I don't think they put enough effort and creativity into cooking it. It tasted just like something I could make at home (although the fiance may disagree). Being at a pricey place, I want to feel that you out time and effort into every dish. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my steak a lot being the steak lover that I am....but I wasn't exactly wowed.. Presentation of the steak was also vey so-so. I would go back again but idk if I want to order their steak again. Their tomato basil sauce with the pasta was good! So maybe I would give pasta a try instead. My fiance ordered seafood Melissa and I do believe he thoroughly enjoyed the dish.  Last but not least, it was the dessert. Tried their butterscotch pound cake. It was fine but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary...probably another reason I gave it 3.75. And oh it was my actual birthday, I thought I could at least get a free bday dessert for spending all this money...but nope we got charged for every last item haha. Oh well...  Regardless, the place is worth trying at least once before you make your final decision!",

We noticed that every single guest was greeted, and treated, like family. From our arrival at the hostess station, to every single knowledgeable server, to an enjoyable visit from Chef Joe himself at our table, to Joe's sister Rita checking in at the end of the evening and thanking us for coming in not one opportunity was missed to make us feel at home.    Friendly is nice, but HOW ABOUT THE FOOD?! We shared a starter of escarole and white beans, topped with homemade fennel sausage. Yeah, I know, that doesn't sound elegant...BUT, when the dish is prepared and plated as it was, humble beans and greens are elevated to match the surroundings. Simply the best I've had anywhere. Ever.   Veal dishes? Not to be missed! Housemade pastas, the BEST meatballs in town, lovely jumbo lump crab salad, a seafood section befitting the best of restaurants on the Eastern Shore, a stellar wine list, a dessert menu (including cannolis!)...I could go on and on.  I chose veal marsala as my entree and a better choice I couldn't imagine. Tender veal, heaps of mushrooms, lush, velvety sauce. Perfection. The hubster also went with a veal selection - veal Romano in his case. Again, perfection.   Oh! I almost forgot the salad of the evening...greens, roasted pear, dried cranberries, pomegranate, walnuts, gorgonzola and a beautiful pomegranate vinaigrette. We cleaned our salad plates!  We each enjoyed a side of pasta - homemade for Mark, an excellent gluten-free version for me - both with a lovely tomato basil cream. You know how much I appreciated the gluten-free option!   Dessert? Yes, please. Mark chose a cannoli - oh how I wished I could have one of my pre-gluten-issue favorite desserts...and I did! Joe put together a cannoli-without-the-shell version that blew me away!   Suffice it to say, the elegant setting, outstanding cuisine and very fine staff elevated Italian comfort food to new and welcome heights. Thanks, Chef Joe! You made a very special anniversary VERY special indeed!",

    "text": "Fabulous experience!    We had our work holiday party on the 3rd floor in the \"Lodge\"... and I have to say every single little thing about planning this dinner, and the dinner itself was an A+++++++++++++++++++ experience!   As a former drug/med rep, I have dealt with a lot of places over the years for dinner programs, and there always seemed to be one snafu or another with events... a lot of times because the venue staff was not being attentive, or because the event coordinator was not able to follow through with what they are supposed to do.  I dealt with Joseph in the month prior to the event, and he was a pleasure to deal with!  Everything was handled quickly, easily and they were more than accommodating.    Everything was amazing from the appetizers, to the salad, to the entrees (which consisted of Seafood Melissa, King Salmon, Pork Chop Paillard, Chicken Parm, NY Strip, and Veal Parm), the desserts were amazing and the wine was great!  The service was also spectacular.  Portions were large so you are definitely getting a lot for your money.    The environment is classy, yet casual and I think whether dressed up or down, you would feel comfortable here.  The <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a> info says \"Smart Casual\" so as long as you were appropriately dressed, you would be comfortable at least.  I would prefer to wear jeans so being able to wear them here is a plus for me!   If you have not tried this great place, you need to!  We will definitely be back for our holiday party next year!",

The tables are set with white table cloths and comfortably spaced. Servers are professional and knowledgeable. The front of the house manager is gracious and welcoming. The namesake chef/owner is very personable and makes an effort to visit each table. The menu offers an assortment of fresh made pastas.

Menu was great, she had the jumbo shrimp scampi. Jumbo is right extremely large shrimp with fresh crabmeat and a decadent butter sauce. I had a breaded pork tenderloin topped with crispy prosciutto, eggplant, cheese mushrooms and probably a bunch of other stuff. Anyway it was a great take on a classic dish and portion was well worth the price. Tambellini is one of pittsburgh's finest chefs and to add to it he's always around his restaurant greeting his guests, it's a great feeling. Great for any occasion, we will absolutely be back!",

Although, it was expensive you get that you pay for and we got a wonderful experience. I've paid much more and received less food at fancier restaurants. Also, they were very flexible with the menu. They must really be cooking the food fresh to be amenable to substitutions. I really appreciated it.  We had meatballs, crab balls, chicken Milanese, and then a couple of make your own pasta dishes. We had a dessert that was a flash fried pastry filled with a rich toffee filling. It was incredible.  But so were the meatballs, crab balls, and chicken Milanese.   Lastly, many people don't mention these sort of things but the chairs were extremely comfortable. They had nice deep cushions and we were given a nice large table made for 4 people just for the 2 of us. It was like eating in your own home, very comfortable.",

    "text": "I'll preface, that I had zero expectations going in, I had just come off of a meh and overpriced meal at the Capital Grille the night before, so was sort of over \"fine dining\".  My friends and I were hankering for some Italian (aka lots of wine) and last minute decided to go to Tambellini.    The price didn't bother me, but again not sure if this was because I had just sat through Capital Grille's absurdity of a pricing model.  I was just thrilled that I didn't have to pay extra for an average salad and pasta...  They have a BYOB options so we brought our own wine.  The bread came with some sort of drinkable (dramatic effect) olive oil that I wanted to pour on everything.  We ordered meatballs as an appetizer.  Delish.... the meatballs were huge and the sauce was also drinkable.  I got a chicken special that they basically should have named after me.  Chicken with a Marsala sauce, topped with melty cheese AND prosciutto. I opted for trenne noodles for my pasta side per my friend's suggestion.  This was so good.  I was a lady at the restaurant and only ate half, but promptly microwaved the leftovers when I got home.  My friends got the salmon special and trenne with chicken and tomato cream sauce and loved both.  We also got the butterscotch pound cake, which I couldn't stop eating and I don't even like sweets.  Our service was wonderful and I can't wait to go back... this weekend... and every weekend!",

I reiterated that it wasn't cooked to my liking and was fatty.. his response was that that's the way the chef cooks it. Really?? I'm the customer. It came back still not cooked to my liking. Unreal. You'd think maybe they'd comp the veal or the very least offer a free dessert. Nothing!!!  At these prices it should be outstanding. Not even close",

I ordered the alfredo dish and my husband got the veal marsala--both amazing. All dinners come with bread, soup/salad, and a small pasta dish (meat entrees only).  For the quality and amount of food, it was actually a rather fair price. You could for real go to Olive Garden and spend about the same. I'll definitely be back!!  Protip:  ORDER A MEATBALL!",

The food was definitely a 5 star review- the portions were generous, they give you a house salad, bread, and a side of pasta before you even get your huge entree. My husband had the veal chop (so great and huge), and I had the special of New York Strip (also delicious and HUGE). We ended our night with the lava cake which was to die for- highly recommend! You can't leave without getting their desert!!   But why give the restaurant a 4 star review? The only reason we are rating this experience as a 4 and not a 5 star review is due to the service. When attending a restaurant with such good reviews, and paying a pretty penny for the food, you expect top of the line service. I would like to note that our waitress could have been new, but if that was the case someone should have been assisting her. The hostess recognized our 1st wedding anniversary, but the server did not mention anything at all. She was very concerned with a table of 6 behind us- it took at least 10 minutes to get water and another 5 after that to get our wine. We had to ask about the specials not on the menu, and she spilled Parmesan cheese all over my dress when putting it on my salad (I didn't care just wanted a small apology). It would have been nice (since we reserved the table through open table and noted our anniversary), if the waitress could have acknowledged or even asked if we were celebrating since this was our first time at the restaurant and the hostess acknowledged it before we said anything. I have been to many nice places, so this is why I feel that I can be critical of the service. My husband and I would try this experience again though, and hope for better service or that our waitress has gotten more experience there!",

The bill for A small salad, two glasses of wine, an appetizer of fried zucchini, and the single pasta entree cost $110.00. We will not be returning to the restaurant. There are more reasonably priced restaurants in Pittsburgh",

Had the crab balls, escarol with White beans & sausage, stuffed banana peppers and fried zucchini for appetizers, AMAZING.  Side salads or soup, both recommendable, and top it off with entrees of seafood Melissa, New York strip rothchild, butternut squash ravioli, chicken Parmasean and horseradish salmon. COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHEF!  Although we had prior thoughts of getting dessert, we were all too full to even try them.  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.",

    "text": "I've passed by Joseph Tambellini several times before and finally got to dine in last night. Although I made a mistake with the reservation and reserved for two instead of three people, they had no problem accommodating an extra person. We got the calamari for appetizer. I enjoyed the texture of it; it's a little crunchier than calamari usually is. For my entree, I ordered the handmade cheese ravioli with Alfredo sauce. It was very creamy and filling as expected, so I was only able to eat about half of it, especially since I wanted to leave room for dessert. It also came with a large meatball in the center of the dish, but I wasn't really a fan of it. For dessert, the three of us shared the lava cake and the cushini fritti (fried sweet pastry dough with vanilla ice cream), which I wouldn't say were unique but still a satisfying way to end the meal. Based on what we tried, portions here tend to be on the smaller side except for the desserts, so order dessert!   Service was very good. Our server was amicable and a total of three people including our server checked up on us during our meal to make sure everything was okay. They've done a good job of creating a warm, homey, and comfortable atmosphere that is great for a nice meal out with friends or special occasions. The food here is just good (far from amazing), but the atmosphere and service make up for it.  Taste | 3.5 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3.5 Service | 4 OVERALL | 4",

    "text": "I've been to Joseph Tambellini's restaurant twice - last winter and last week.  My initial experience was great.  My friend and i went, had great food (although I don't remember what I got) and the staff was great, etc.    However, this past experience - was frustrating to say the least.  I went with 2 other ladies for one of their birthdays. Please note - my frustrations have NOTHING to do with the food.  It was amazing - the problem was the staff who took care of us.    First problem - 1 of the ladies asked for butter for the bread brought to the table.  No biggie - you would think.  However it took 4 times of asking to get the butter - after our entree's came.    Second problem - honestly this was our big problem.  Our waitress was in such a rush to get us out of there.  The ladies were still drinking their coffee - she took their cups.  She brought the bill, and we had it between 2 of us - away from her because 2 of us were paying together getting money situation - she reach in front of my face - as in her clothes were brushing my face - to grab it.  WE WERE NOT READY.  Then - the thing that frustrated me and I found disrespectful - she took the bill, and started counting our tip before we left - in front of us.  We aren't shabby tippers - but really.  Have a little class.  She was a disorganized mess.  Honestly, I will not forget her name and will probably ask to NOT be seated at her table if I go back.  Just for the record - we were not taking our time.  We had reservations at 6:15p and were out by 8p, but we had gifts for the birthday gal and they would have loved to have enjoyed their coffee.  The gifts went unopened and the coffee disappeared before they drank half the cup.  Third problem - I understand that this is in a house, so room is tight.  I completely LOVE this set up.  However, we were seated beside the bar, almost next to the main doorway near the bathrooms.  We could barely move or hear each other because the wait staff was clanking bowls and trays around.  One point they put a tray on a stand behind one of the other ladies so that if she backed up, she would have knocked a whole tray of entree's over.    The whole atmosphere at Tambellini's is interesting - sometimes bizarre - at least what I experienced on a Friday night.  However, the food was superb.  My mafalda Caprese was to die for.  I was so upset the next morning when I realized I didn't put the leftovers in the fridge.    Everyone truly enjoyed their food, other than feeling rushed.",

It was worth the drive! The bartender makes an excellent classic cocktail.  The food is outstanding! You must try the wedding soup, the meatball, and a signature salad(I recommend Cesar) for starters.  I chose the mafalda caprese(a homemade pasta) for dinner and it was amazing!   Now let's talk about the service... The service is 3 star at best.  My server Holly was good but not 5 star she wasn't attentive, my beverage glass went empty, and she overall rushed us through dinner even though the restaurant wasn't packed and she didn't have that many tables.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is stuffy and not very welcoming but the food is amazing. I will try other restaurants in the Bloomfield area before returning to this one.",

The tomato and cream sauce tasted like chef boyardee can sauce. The calamari was OK at best and while the crab cakes were good, the sauce was terrible. Not to mention, when I returned to my house, my food was cold. Did I mention that I lived around the corner from the restaurant?  Anyways.... I would not go back and would not recommend it to anyone as there are many other Italian places in Pittsburgh that offer a good value and a great meal as well.   This is my third time back and each time, I was disappointed. I really wanted to try and enjoy this resturant being that I love supporting locally owned businesses, especially the ones in my neighborhood. However,Tambellini is not worth the hype...save your money",

There were so many delicious things to try that we asked him what he would have as his perfect meal. He thought that was pretty fun to design our meal! We started sharing the crab balls. They were very good. The meals (non-pasta) come with a salad and a pasta course.  There is so much food so come hungry! I had the burrata cheese salad and my husband had the house salad. Both were delicious but the cheese melted in my mouth. I had the house pasta which is basically rigatoni with a vodka sauce. Pasta was done perfectly! Sauce was very tasty. The chef made my husband a special pasta that was very spicy with angel hair. He really enjoyed it but it was pretty spicy. For dinner we each had a filet. Mine was done pizziolo style which was with cheese and peppers and my husband's was done Lucca style.  Both were delicious. We had the chocolate lava cake for dessert. This wasn't a huge cake thankfully since we were stuffed! It was also good. If you go I would suggest asking the wait staff for their suggestions because some of what we got was not on the menu. I would highly recommend going!",

    "text": "Whew, when is this guy going to start getting lazy, to start calling it in, to start farming out the time behind the stove to lesser, workaday, unemotionally invested chefs who don't cook with heart, passion and a sincere desire to show off his--or their--remarkable culinary chops?  When will he rest on his soft, no doubt ample bed of laurels and just spend night after night lazily swiping credit cards for food that no longer matches the inspired fare he has served up for the first years of this jewel's existence? Well, I can assure you that that day was not 12/27/17.    The maestro is still up to his same stunning tricks of churning out one remarkable course after another.  And as noted in previous reviews here and elsewhere, what I admire most about the man's talents is his restraint.  Explain, you say?  Well, have you ever seen the mid-80's movie \"Amadeus\" and the scene where the king tells Mozart that his new opera contains \"too many notes\" and suggests the boy genius remove a few of said superfluous notes? [Review intermission:  The king is sort of a dufus, which his criticism of Mozart indicates, and the critique's absurdity is driven home by Mozart's startlingly brash reply of, \"Really? And which notes would you suggest?\"...or something like that. Now, the know-nothing king was wrong, so that part of the analogy doesn't apply to this review, but you know what I'm saying, right?  You do?  Awesome.  You don't?  Damn. That's on me.  I'm one martini-deep at this point.  I thank you for your understanding and apologize for using an analogy that falls apart mid-analogy.]  Well, Chef Joseph never, ever has \"too many notes\" in his dishes, and therein lies his brilliance.  Last night's entrees--a special that night--were a first for us there: Duck confit.  Lordy, what a culinary coup it was.  Duck is tricky, as you may know.  It needs balanced by something sweet and something savory, as you know.  I'm being pretentious, pedantic and condescending, as you know.  Forgive me.  I'm really just a coarse, know-nothing pretender.  But man, did he just NAIL IT with the gnocchi and cherries in a reduction that, had we not been seated in prime viewing area, I'd have lapped up like a doltish cow. (Excuse the redundancy, because let's face it, cows look doltish even before those undulating tongues make an appearance.)    If you're still with me (much thanks to both of you), trust me. Eat here!  Get the stuffed banana peppers.  Eat them. Cry with gratitude while you eat them.  Reminisce about the experience immediately after while your tongue is still gloriously ablaze. Get the buffalo mozzarella salad.  If you have tears left after the banana peppers, cry those, too.  Then let your eyes roll back in your head like Quint's shark [movie reference #2...c'mon work with me...or IMDB it]  while eating whatever entree you order.    The service is always perfect. Always. The mixed drinks are crafted with a hand that goes heavy on the pouring of the main alcoholic ingredient, in my case gin.  The \"wines by the glass\" options are many.   That all said, I give this place 2 out of 5 stars. Okay, just seeing if anyone is still reading this drivel.  I give it 7 out of 5, but only because I had to say \"no mushrooms\" when ordering the sublime confit.  I mean, why anyone eats mushrooms...Oh wait, it's just me? (Told you you I was a coarse, culinary cretin.) In that case, 8 out of 5.   Seriously folks, this place is the goods.  We live near DC and we eat at Chef Joe T's every time we come to Pittsburgh. It's remarkably consistent in its excellence and always a highlight of our trips to Pittsburgh.  I strongly urge you to eat here. Repeatedly. Sure, I care about your dining satisfaction, but more so because I'm selfish and want Tambellini's to stay in business until I check out of this mortal coil [his pretentiousness continues to the end!]...and if I keep downing those heavenly martinis at Tambellini's, that might be within the next six months.",

The soup that came with my entree was salty and borderline inedible (returned it back). The Mafalda Giancarlo entree was interesting, but nothing to rave about. The other entree was a some sort of a trio (grilled chicken, shrimp, steak) linguine; the shrimp was overcooked and didn't taste fresh at all.    All in all, this place didn't offer any value for money and seems like it's is stuck in time.

Every course is wonderful and I definitely recommend that you save room for dessert and take your leftover dinner home. We tried the crab balls, sesame calamari, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parmesan, soup, and salad and everything was cooked wonderfully. For dessert we shared the butterscotch pound cake and it was warm, moist, and absolutely spectacular.

    "text": "Hubby took me to Joseph Tambelini's for my birthday dinner.  It was a great experience and we enjoyed our meal.    Upon entering, there was a lovely woman to check my coat.  There was another couple leaving so it was a big tight having us all in the same small area at the door.  When she took my coat she found our reservation right away and told me she would show me to our table while the hubby parked the car.  I noticed right away that the decor was a clean modern look.  The soft lighting was just right for a date night out.  Not too dark and not too bright either.  When the hubby arrived at the table, we began to look over the menu.  The server arrived and offered to get us drinks.  Both the hubby and myself got a glass of merlot and some water.  We also ordered the Famous Fried Zucchini.  We received the appetizer and some bread fairly quickly.  The zucchini was very lightly breaded and served with a marinara sauce.  It was very good.  Not greasy at all.  For the entrees, the hubby ordered the Ribeye Special and I opted for the Chicken Parmesan.  Both entrees came with soup or salad and a side of pasta.  The soup was a chicken wedding soup and the salad was a field greens salad with a pomegranate vinaigrette.  Both were tasty and fresh.  When the entrees arrived, we were surprised at how large the portions were.  The steak was a 22 oz boneless ribeye with sauteed onions.  It was perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of seasoning.  The sear on the outside was just right.  The Chicken Parmesan had 3 very lightly breaded cutlets, which were pounded thinly.  It was topped with a perfect amount of cheese and their marinara sauce.  It was probably the best Chicken Parmesan I've ever had.  It was tasty, but not too heavy, which can sometimes be the case.   We decided against desert as we were both more than satisfied with the meal.  We both had large portions to take home, which the server was happy to pack up for us.  This was an all around wonderful night out.  Obviously it's not an inexpensive meal, but it was well worth it for the combination of the service, quality and quantity of food.  We will definitely be placing this on our list of date night options.  Pros: Service is impeccable Decor is clean modern Food is delicious Wine choices are expansive Portions are huge  Cons: Parking is street parking (but this is expected for Highland Park) Prices are high (but the quality and quantity make it acceptable) Entry way can be a bit congested",

It had a confused flavor. The salad was truly delightful as was our very kind server.  I ordered one of their \"most popular dishes.\" It was literally a huge plate of boiled and very thick pasta with the smallest amount of olive oil and 0 flavor.  I returned it because a toddler could have made better pasta. Not only did I not like it but my guest, who would eat almost anything couldn't stomach it either. I literally sent back the entire plate. I was extremely embarrassed because I have NEVER done that. I asked the server to switch it out for something different and was told the kitchen had \"thrown out the water, and it would take at least 20 minutes\". I don't exactly understand what that means. I told them not to worry and I could instead split the meal with my guest and we could get 2 desserts instead. Unbeknownst to me, the plate was packaged for me (even though I returned it) . After ordering two desserts and finishing our bottle of wine I requested the hill.  Upon receipt of my bill I was told, in a whisper by the server, I would have to pay for the rejected plate but it was packaged up for me so I was still allowed to take it home.  I didn't want it fresh, why would I want to take it home? Luckily it was only 27 dollars but the audacity of the manager was absolutely blood boiling. Especially since he didn't have the guts to address the issue himself and sent his poor young waitress to break the news to me.  I have never had such poor managerial service. I absolutely did not expect it at what I perceived to be a respectable establishment from other yelp reviewers. The server is at no fault as she was very apologetic and provided excellent service.  The manager or restaurant owner clearly need those 27 dollars more than I do which I gladly provided them as to not upset myself excessively on my birthday.  What kind of a restaurant is this? Oh, and the kicker, they knew it was birthday, and still treated me like crap. Even a fast food restaurant would have addressed the issue.  The ravioli was the other dish we ordered and it brought back memories of chef Boyardee. It's insane how much it tastes like it. I would know since my niece and nephew gobble that up all the time. If you like chef boyardee you'll love the ravioli!",

Have been to this location when it was another restaurant but not as JT's and they are celebrating 10 years, so it must be good!  And it was! Will have to try in the summer and sit on the patio out front, it looks like a great place to sit, imbibe and enjoy a good meal. We ordered a bottle of wine from a large wine list that had a very nice select of wines.  The pricing was fair and not over the top like most other restaurants many of which I will not go to for that reason.  That is a big plus!   We shared an order of the Famous Fried Zucchini, which was good.  My dinner came with the Victoria salad that I had fresh slices of parmesan instead of the gorgonzola cheese.  A nice fresh salad.  Having been told that the pasta is homemade and prepared perfectly, I had the Trenne with Salmon and Lump Crabmeat with a tomato basil cream sauce.  The pasta was very good and perfectly prepared.  Lots of tasty crabmeat and salmon.  A real good choice.  Yes, leftovers for lunch the next day. We split a pecan ball with fudge for desert.  A nice way to finish.  Our table of four was a little small for the plates, wine decanter and glasses, wish it was a tab bigger.  Our waitress was OK.  We did get water refills as needed but I guess for this price point, I expect a more refined and on point service.      #1000. Woo!",

The staff are exceptionally well-trained, and attentive.  Even to each other's tables. The presentation and quality of the food, along with the bevy of wine options, make this place world-class.   I was shocked at the friendliness of the staff, from the maitre d', to the owners, to the servers.  While I elected to partake entirely of the specials, my companion chose a more traditional option of the eggplant parmesan.  Each of us left more satisfied that we could have banked on and we didn't even manage to sneak in dessert because we were so full.  That was disappointing, given the quality offered.    I would not only recommend this restaurant, but I would recommend traveling great distances to partake of their service and cuisine. This is a diamond of a place, and we learned that this is the last generation of the Tambellini's to own a restaurant (most likely). So, you better get your dining in because there is no guarantee it will last forever.",

I was really made to feel like i didn't belong and was an inconvenience.  My food was nothing to write home about and certainly not worth it.

The sauteed calamari appetizer was flavorful, saucy and very tender...yummy! We split the chicken masala entree special and it hit the spot. Additionally, the outside patio on Bryant street was quiet and perfect for a date night.   Only minor improvements (in my opinion) I'd expect is for the service to be a little more engaging and less rushed, and tastier cocktails.

    "text": "Tucked away in a charming three-story house at the end of Bryant Street in Highland Park is a truly delicious little Italian restaurant. I've been here a couple of times over the years and the food is among some of my favorite in the city. Since the restaurant is in a house, it's best to make reservations, as it's not a huge space and can get crowded. Also due to its small size, the tables are rather close together (not ideal, but it doesn't bother me too much), so it's definitely a cozy dining experience.  As for the food, they offer a range of traditional Italian dishes (pastas, etc.), steaks, and seafood. Our most recent visit here was to celebrate our anniversary. Our meal started with fresh bread and a sun-dried tomato and roasted garlic olive oil for dipping. This olive oil was soooo flavorful....I loved it so much that I found myself wishing that it was socially appropriate to chug the leftovers! For our meals, I ordered the chicken parmesan (can't resist a classic when I go out for Italian), and my husband opted for the crab cakes. Each meal comes with either a house salad or soup, as well as a pasta tasting. The soup that day was a chicken pastina that was to die for....perfectly seasoned broth with plentiful chunks of chicken and veggies, yum! The pasta tasting was fresh rigatoni with tomato basil cream sauce. Every single aspect of the pasta dish was on point. The pasta itself was cooked to a perfect al dente and the sauce had a great balance of acidity and sweetness. The sauce also managed to be light, despite the inclusion of cream. And of course, the main event....my chicken parmesan...was also absolutely delicious. It's a simple dish, but Tambellini's executes it impeccably. They achieve a perfectly light and crispy breading on a moist chicken breast and pair it with super flavorful marinara sauce and plenty of cheese for good measure. It truly is Italian comfort food at its finest. The portion is very generous as well...after the bread, soup, and pasta, I couldn't even finish half of my chicken. As for my husband's meal, he had equally high praise for the crab cakes, reporting that they were some of the most flavorful crab cakes he's ever had.   The food never fails to disappoint. Why the four stars then? Well, it's not inexpensive to eat here, and I've never felt like the service is on par with the high end restaurant that they are. Don't get me wrong....the service isn't bad. But I've never experienced particularly friendly or exceptional service, and there are always little things here and there that detract from the experience. For example, on our last visit, our waiter asked the table beside us if they wanted more bread, but didn't offer more bread to us when our basket was empty (perhaps he saw how much I loved the olive oil and wanted to test if I actually *would* chug the oil by itself in the absence of more bread). It also took an abnormally long time to get our bill, and my leftovers were sloppily boxed (one of the pieces of chicken was placed upside down, so the cheese stuck and hardened onto the bottom of the container). None of these things are a huge deal, but if I'm paying $100+ for dinner, I expect service that's better than just \"okay.\" So one star off for that reason.",

For our entrees, we had lamb with amazing basil gnocchi, beef medallions with shrimp on a delectable sauce, and a pasta dish with a well paired array of vegetables. I cannot say enough about the quality and flavor of the food, it is well worth the drive into the city for a meal here.   I'm sorry to agree with other reviewers. Our server Chad, has truly reduced our experience. His demeanor was snarky from the start. He seemed rather distasteful of the specials as he repeated then abruptly.  I had to drink my parents water because we only saw him to deliver our plates, then when he checked on us immediately following delivery. When he took the entree orders he dashed away so quickly I had to call him back to order wine for my mom. Our empty plates were left well after we had finished with our food. For the quality of the meal, it is such a shame that the service was less friendly or attentive than I usually experience at eat n park.   This is a place to visit for an amazing meal, just don't expect much in the way of service.  I did notice the regular customers were attended to with courtesy and grace, so being a new guest could be the reason our experience was less than stellar.",

    "text": "I had dinner here last night with my Sis' and parents.  It's only a couple blocks from Mom's house, so I was hoping for good things in such a convenient locale'.  We had reservations for 7PM and it's a good thing, because I didn't notice many empty seats in the house.  It's in a big converted house and has two floors for dining and I think a private space on the third floor.  The space is beautiful we enter the front door into the first dining room and are greated warmly by the host who is wearing a suit and has a warm smile.  The other staff that notice us also go out of there way to turn and smile.  He takes the coats and leads us upstairs.  There is a bar with a couple stools on the first floor, but this isn't the type of place where you'd be eating at the bar.  THere are white linens, great lighting, interesting pictures and overall just a truly beautiful atmosphere.  We are seated on the second floor at a great seat in the corner and the waiter arrives quickly to fill our glasses and give me the wine list.  The list seemed okay, I'd prefer a few more selections.  We start with a bottle of some type of Syrah for $52, he brings it over and leaves this beautiful decanter on the table.  We then place our order.  We'll start with fried zucchini and greens and beans.  The waiter brings over some bread.  The bread was good quality, but cold.. a small pet peeve of mine.  It was served with this delicious olive oil mixture that was placed in the middle of the table with a miniature ladel.  The olive oil is delicous too many seasonings to mention and also smoked garlic which was nice when squooshed (sp?) onto the bread.  The apps' arrive.  The fried zucchini is meh', I mean really disappointing.  It's cut up little squares with heavy breading and no flavor.  I've had much better at chain restaurants.  The escarole and beans however were delicious lots of garlic and good quality tasty sausage.  We are then brought a nice light salad of microgreens and balsamic.  The salad also has a few interesting components like edamame?? and sunflower seeds.  I don't eat salads, but I was told it was quite nice.  Then they brought us a pasta dish.  It was to die for,,, I mean I guess it should be since it's a fine dining italian, but I was blown away.  It's a small serving of house made pasta and a nice creamy tomatoe gravy.  It was really really good.  Then our entrees' arrive.  I ordered the sablefish, sis' had the veal picatted, dad had the cajun mahi mahi and mom had the veal chop.  I'll start wth the fish.  I didn't expect that I would have one of the best pieces of fish of my life in an italian joint, but I did.  And, I'm no rookie.  I mean one of the best, maybe the best piece of fish I've ever had.  It was a deep rich buttery fish with a beautiful butter buerre blanc.  Think of the best piece of monkfish or mayble lobster you've ever had and that will give you a small sense of how good this was.  Dad's mahi wasn't that good.  It was overcooked, dry and relatively flavorless.  Heather's veal picatta was really good and cooked perfectly with a healthy topping of capers.  Mom's veal chop was good, but not even in the same zip code as Jonathan's at Alla Famiglia.  However, Jonathan will charge you about twice as much for his.  They also made me a nice stiff dirty martini and dad was a little annoyed that they didn't have guiness (I hear ya dad').  They didn't have much of a selection.  He settled on a Heineken.  The service was slow and we decided to get dessert to go.  We often found ourselves waiting for things throughout the night.  Overall, a very good restaurant.  It the wine and beer selection was better, the service a bit quicker it would come close to 5 stars.  I think the prices overall are reasonable.  There really is no reason to get apps' and if you skip the wine.  You can have a delicious meal with bread, salad, pasta and entrees' for around $30.  That's value.  I'll go again.",

I don't think it is bad, just \"old school\" in a way that perhaps makes it more appealing to certain segments of restaurant-goers than to others. I'm in the latter segment. It is fine but not wow. That's okay, since it all depends on what you're looking for. This just wasn't my cup of tea, so-to-speak. I'm mostly referring to the food, which is what I would call more \"classic\" upper-scale American-Italian than anything else. The service is very friendly and clearly the team care a lot about their restaurant. This is a good place that could be better. Frankly, if the kitchen took a few risks and played it less safe I think it would be an improvement.",

We ordered the \"signature\" meatball appetizer, followed by main courses of a stuffed pork-chop, an 18oz veal chop, and home-made raviolis. For dessert, we ordered the pecan ball with vanilla ice cream, the butterscotch pound cake and the lava cake - and, of course, cappuccino. Although relatively pricey, the portions were generous and the food perfectly prepared. If you are looking for an excellent Italian restaurant in the Pittsburgh area, this is the place!",

We went at an earlier time with our son who is 2 and the staff was incredibly courteous and very nice.       We got an appetizer (which is unnecessary given the volume of food coming out in subsequent courses standard with your meal) which was good but it did not compare to the pasta course.  The salad and the soup was very good and our meals were incredible.  I had veal and my wife had chicken both of which were some of the best we have ever had.  We are from Chicago and lived in Little Italy for 4 years during which time we ate a lot of Italian and this place rivals all of our favorites from back home.  To top the meal off we had desserts which were great, the butterscotch poundcake was way more food than we should have ordered but it was gone in seconds!     It wasn't cheap but given the amount of food that comes with your meal  Tambellini a great deal in our opinion; especially when you compare it to other restaurants of similar quality that typically charge just as much for an Ala Carte meal.  We look forward to eating here for years to come!",

    "text": "This is a must try restaurant when in the 'Burgh!  It is an old converted house in Highland Park transformed into a warm, homey, yet upscale Italian eatery with very good food.  Reservations are highly recommended, especially on the weekends.  We started out with one meatball each and they were tender and DELICIOUS!  You choose your entree and it comes with the salad and pasta course which comes before the meal itself like a traditional italian restaurant. The salad was decent, but not memorable because the dressing was just missing something.  OMG BUT the PASTA course....it is beyond delectable.  It comes in a pink sauce and the pasta is perfect and I could have licked my plate if no one was looking.    Fiance got the butterflied shrimp which our fellow dining guest said was 'beyond', and I had the lamb with mushroom risotto.  The shrimp looks pretty ordinary, but it is anything but. It is scrumptious! It isn't overly breaded and is flavorful and fresh. The best thing about it is the homemade tartar sauce that it comes with along with a chunky cocktail sauce, which isn't very spicy, but tasty and doesn't overpower the shrimp.  My lamb was out of this world as well.  A good portion of lamb on top of a bed of mushroom risotto with a moat of this heavenly brown lamb sauce that I couldn't get enough of.  The risotto wasn't quite creamy enough, but it was good. (I am crazy picky about my risotto)   Our friend's filet mignon dish looked absolutely amazing! We should have taken a bite.  We will try that next time we're in town for sure!  The piece de resistance was the butterscotch pound cake for dessert.  SO GOOD! Decadent, rich with a light butterscotch flavor.   The only comments I have otherwise is about the bread-it's just not that great, and neither is the herbed olive oil that accompanies it.  When it's busy, the service is a little slower than normal, but not terrible.  Everyone is very personable and sweet here and you may even have a chat with the chef himself when he comes around to see how everyone's meal is going.    A must try when in Pittsburgh!",

They have a very traditional menu. My wife ordered the ravioli and I had the filet. Both were prepared exactly to our request. The chicken corn chowder soup was almost a meal in itself. This is a very romantic restaurant as witnessed by the proposal that took place five minutes before we were seated.

    "text": "Pay no attention to China Millman's recent review in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, JT's (as my family has taken to referring to it) is fabulous. My parents were big fans of JT  when he was the chef at Franco's, and he has brought his vast skill (in addition to waiter Eddie) with him to Highland Park. I've had two salads at JT's - the first time I had the daily salad (the one that comes with the meal - and let me tell you, as a Chicagoan, I am definitely NOT used to a salad accompanying the meal!), and it was a pleasant mixture of spring greens. The last time I was there, I had the Victoria (named after one of his daughters), which had dark greens, apple slices, gorgonzola cheese, candied pecans, and a raspberry vinaigrette dressing. While only occasionally a salad person, I left no trace of this one on the plate.  We chose to do the pasta course (again included with the meal) before our entrees. My mom and I had the daily pasta - a gemelli-like pasta in a tomato-cream sauce that I quickly devoured, while my sister enjoyed her trenne arrabiata, and my dad loved his linguini with white clams. I've previously had the trenne in tomato basil sauce, and thought those were fantastic as well.  I have been hard pressed to find a chicken marsala that is better than one I had in Toronto more than ten years ago, but I think I've found it here! Perfectly cooked, tender, and delicious, I had to stop myself before I ate too much! When my boyfriend had dinner there with us, he ate every last morsel of his osso buco and is still, three months later, reliving that dinner.   While I haven't had the crab cakes there, we did bring some uncooked ones home to add to our Christmas Eve Feast of the Seven Fishes, and I can honestly say that I have never had a better crab cake (including the ones I got in San Francisco in October).  I've never had dessert at JT's, but I hear great things about the butterscotch pound cake, and may have to try it the next time I'm in town. For those of you in Pittsburgh, go to JT's. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "This restaurant is just as good as all of the reviews say it is.  My expectations are pretty high when a restaurant manages to keep 5 Yelp stars, and let me tell you - these 5 stars are well-deserved.  I went to Joseph Tambellini for a family birthday with a party of 8, and we ended up sitting up on the third floor in the private room.  It's a different atmosphere than the rest of the restaurant, but it was quiet and wonderful.  It's a bit more casual, a lodge feel, but I am already imagining what other celebrations I'm going to try to reserve that room for!  Now, on to the food.  It was amazing.  I ordered the pork chop special of the night - it was covered with a fig/balsamic/gorgonzola concoction and it was cooked perfectly.  Also, it was enourmous.  I got to re-live my meal at Tambellini for dinner the next night.  I had a pasta course and salad, both of which come with the entree.  The pasta was again perfectly cooked and covered in a delicious, rich tomato basil cream sauce.  The salad was fresh and tasty, and the bread was warm and had a yummy garlic/olive oil dipping sauce with it.    I also managed to snag a taste of everyone else's entrees and am happy to report that all were just as good as mine.  The steaks are literally a pound of beef, cooked perfectly and topped with yummy accents (one special this evening had some sort of horseradish topping, which was to die for).  Seriously, the food was SO good.  You have to try it to understand JUST HOW GOOD IT IS.  The service: it was awesome.  I feel bad for those servers who have to walk up the narrow stairs hundreds of times a day, but they were friendly and attentive.  And, I guess on the plus side, all those stairs eliminate the need for a gym membership.  The owners are very nice, obviusly committed to great service and the highest quality food, and one of them greeted us at the door as we arrived.  Overall, this was a wonderful dining experience.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back to Joseph Tambellini for a romantic dinner for two or for a larger family function in the awesome third floor party room.  Thanks for a wonderful evening!",

With the food scene growing leaps and bounds in the city, its amazing that this place can even keep its doors open.   NOTHING was made to order. Everything, from the meatballs to the stuffed peppers to the salads to the main dishes were pre made then heated up when ordered. The red sauce that covered everything was the same hiding everything underneath. I can understand making dinner salads ahead of time but REFRIGERATE them. The leaves were warm when served. Unreal. Lastly, I had some seafood dinner that included crab stuffed shrimp, some kind of white fish and scallops. Basically, after defrosting the frozen fish, they sprinkled the entire dish with bread crumbs and threw it in the oven for a couple of minutes. TOTALLY TASTELESS.   Runaway from this place as fast as you can. Tell everyone you know because this place does NOT serve Italian food, it serves pre made, tasteless garbage.",
