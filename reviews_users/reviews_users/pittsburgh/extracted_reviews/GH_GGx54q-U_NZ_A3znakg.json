Go to Shelly Pie Pizza instead. It's what Vincent's was 30 years ago",

Several months ago we drove miles to eat there and was greeted by a sign on the door saying one of their ovens was broken and the wait would be 1 to 1 1/2 hours. We endured the wait. Thinking that was just a one time thing, we again drove miles to eat there only to be told the wait would be 1 1/2 hours. No broken oven - they just couldn't keep up. They had only ONE waitress who deserved a medal. We actually waited 2 hours. Everyone was disgusted. Think that's my last visit. If you're going, I would call first to ask about the wait.",

The oak leaves in the bar ceiling, flour all over Vinnie himself, the cigarette hanging out of his mouth, all were reasons some of my neighbors scoffed when offered some pizza from Vinnie's, but my family and circle of friends couldn't get enough.  One of the best things about that pie was the dough and crust. Vinnie baked the pies till the crust had a combination of lightly browned and slightly burnt surfaces, and the inside had a combination of air pockets and chewy dough that made eating the crust itself a meal to look forward to. It was like eating focaccia with great toppings on it.  While my family still makes a point of getting a pie at Vinnie's when we're in town, since Vinny passed away and the business has new ownership (some years back now) it has lost that subtlety in the crust that made it worth 5 stars, and I find myself disappointed when I get to the bready, dull outer crust that used to be the great finishing element of the pie.",

There are so many better places to eat.  Vincent's (or Vinnie's) is one of them.  Yeah they sell subs, pepperoni rolls and other assorted fare, but let's be real. If you aren't ordering a pie here, you're the type of person that goes to a Burgatory and asks what the chicken menu looks like.  The pizza is the main draw, and it is huge. The crust is large and unruly. The cheese is piled on, the toppings are piled on. The grease that remained could have made a meal all its' own.   This is not a hands only meal.   At one point in time as me and my four diners stared down the remnants of our Pepperoni/Sausage pizza we realized we had come proud and would be leaving humbled.  Did it take awhile to get the Pizza, yes. Does the pizza have the same circumference of a school bus tire and everyone in the place is ordering a large, yes.  How long does that take to cook people? You do the math.  Try it out, expect a food coma.",

It's this little joint off Ardmore, but the folks manning the oven are Masters!  They crank out these giant, misshapen pizzas with fresh homemade ingredients and huge huge huge toppings.  Everything is hardcore good.  I got a large that had fine-ground, handcut pepperonis the size of giant checkers and sausage chunks like meatballs.  If you're looking for commercial-grade, round pizza shelled out to the masses, go elsewhere, but if you want the real deal, do yourself a favor and find this place 'cause Vincent's has the quality in the right place (the pizza).  UPDATE:  My review is now anecdotal.  Vincent's has been closed.  BOO!!",

Vincent's had been on our radar for weeks and, upon pulling into the parking lot, I understood why. The place has this old route 66 roadhouse vibe, complete with crappy neon. But don't, dear friends, judge that proverbial book by its cover because the True magic awaited us inside.  We were seated right away by a super friendly, young waitress. Big, clunky picnic table style seating, with a HUGE bottle of franks red hot on the table!!!! YES. We ordered out pies, 2 total: one with all of the meats (too many to remember) and another with onions, peppers and mushrooms. Both a size small.   This pizza is more like a sculptural work of art, with a taste to match. The crust was light and crisp with a nice sweetness. Tangy perfect sauce and huge chunks of veggies just strewn about, like someone hand- ripped the green pepper and scattered it about. I love, love me some rustic throw-down pizza and I think that Vincent's just may be the best example of this I have ever seen, with a taste to match!  Don't expect to get up and run the 5k after this one though. There are greasy gobs of cheese for miles here. You may fall asleep at the wheel on your way home so I suggest pairing this fantastic meal with a large fountain drink.",

The Pepperoni pizza is THE best.    The place looks like a dive bar in many ways, but the pizza could not be better.  If you get take-out, bring a towel to put on the seat/floor of your car, underneath the pizza, as the grease will surely run through the cardboard and paper.  And yes, the pizza is as greasy as it comes, so all you de-greasers (me included) will be in de-greasing heaven (or hell, depending on your viewpoint).",

The waitress looked like she was going to cry the other one was bitching at us about our server. There's no music playing its bright as hell such an awkward atmosphere. I got up and asked someone from the front. They bought us a single beer to compensate that we weren't planning to order.

Any other pizza shop who had someone waiting for 2 hours in the restaurant would comp the pie. That's like simple customer service decency.",

Be aware that some GPS's do not like this area and ours had us headed in the wrong direction so we had to go back to the house, make a phone call and start again.  Then, when we saw the place it was too late and we were on our way to another community with no way to turn around for a while.  Oh well, that's Pittsburgh for ya! lol   When I called to order I asked how large the pizzas were and was told by the male who answered \"I can only eat maybe 2 pieces.\"  So, we ordered a large for the 4 of us, divided the toppings into 4 quarters and still had leftovers for the fridge.  They are very generous with the toppings!!  I liked the flavor of the pizza very much but it is very thick and I am more a fan of a thin crust. Too much bread for my tastes, so I kept to the center and left the 'bones'. That's not to say that I would turn down a pizza from Vincent's.  :)",

You can't put this many toppings on a pizza and have it bake properly.  There was a huge lake of watery nothing all over the pan.  A great pizza is that perfect harmony of crust to sauce to cheese and toppings.  I couldn't make a worse pizza if I set out to do it.    To top off the misguided and poorly cooked nightmare they call a pizza it had no seasonings.  They put out an empty six pack with salt, pepper, pepper flakes, oregano, powdered garlic and hot sauce.  Are you kidding me?  This is as ridiculous as Beto's with the bread and sauce with cold shredded cheese on top.  I am disgusted and insulted just thinking about this meal.  It was one of the worst I have had in Pittsburgh and I have had dozens of bad ones here.    If you desperate enough to eat here, I would order one with extra sauce, light on the cheese and plain.  It's so flavorless though I would ask for half pepperoni or sausage to add some flavor and tell them you want them to take that half and spread it over the entire pizza.    I prefer crisp thin crust pizza but I am from Chicago and also like deep dish and am just fine with a nice NY style slice too.  I love pizza.  It's one of my favorite meals.  This is none of the above.  If you want a pizza that is comparable to what they are trying to do, go to Burgh Pizza & Wing in Bridgeville.  This is a NY style slice with the droopy center and thick corona of crust.  Perfectly balanced cheese, sauce and delicious well cooked crust.  The sauce is flavorful and slightly spicy, not too sweet and very well seasoned with herbs and salt!  I have no idea what this is.    I was totally misled by the reviews of this restaurant.  If there are 500 pizzas in Pittsburgh, I would try this one last if I were you.  This is a Pizza only Pittsburgh could love.",

The pizza is delicious and loaded with fresh ingredients.  The pepperoni pizza has fresh sliced sticks of pepperoni covering the pie.  If you get it to go they put the pizza on a cardboard sheet, put paper over-top of it and then staple the paper to the bag!     Health wise, this may take several years off of your life!  But then again, those extra years might not be the same without Vincent's Pizza!",

    "text": "Loved Vincent's. I make the ride from New Ken just for this pie. You pay a little extra to get a lot more. However... occasionally they're just careless. When I say careless, I'm including many of the complaints listed in some of the other posts (long waits and poor service) which I usually let slide because they're consistently busy on weekends and often understaffed. However, I can't keep ignoring when they skimp on the pie. Last night I ordered a pepperoni to go and was told it would be an hour wait. It took a little longer, but I expected it. Sadly, though, when we got the pie the pepperoni was sparse and in shredded pieces. They'd done this before but had usually compensated by adding extra shreds (another reviewer has a photo of this scenario). This time, though, it was less than half that amount. More often that not, over the past few years this has become the rule rather than the exception. It sounds like a minor complaint, and maybe it is to some, but when it used to be that they'd give you thick-sliced and ample amounts of pepperoni you come to expect it. It's an unspoken agreement that at Vincent's you pay more than you would at any other pizza joint, but you get a lot more, too. You can't get sloppy with your customers. It's a Pittsburgh institution. Respect it. Do what's right. I doubt if I'm gonna make the ride again.",

Party, best-of-class, one stop.  OH, we want to eat there next time. I can't put finger on WHY; the dine-in space wasn't especially fun or funky, but just... welcoming.

    "text": "It was a Saturday afternoon when I got the call that my parents were stopping over on their way home. And, \"Could we do dinner at your place?\"   Having spent a large chunk of our day cleaning the basement, 2 tired, smelly individuals didn't feel like washing up to go out or like throwing together an impromptu meal for the 'rents. Not wanting to disappoint, we scrambled for a solution. Being Pittsburgh pizza veterans, but not yet having had the iconic \"Vinnie Pie,\" we decided to take leap and order from the newly remodeled original Pizza Park on Ardmore. We hoped that its reputation lived up to its legendary yet controversial status, as my parents are quite the connoisseurs of a hand-made pie.   I called to order, and a cheerful sounding voice took my order for a large pepperoni quickly and said it would be 30 minutes. Thinking that a large wouldn't be enough for 4 people, as my dad can annihilate a large pizza himself in one sitting,  I called back a few minutes later to tack on another medium with sausage. Little did i know how that would turn out.    $30 worth of pizza and a delicious smelling car ride later, we knew we were in for an experience. I was all but crushed under the weight of the two pies in my lap in the passenger seat. No kidding. It took dedicated restraint not to immediately rip into the grease spotted, hot paper-covered cardboard slabs as we sped home.   Upon dismantling, we realized that the amount we ordered was laughably ridiculous. It would have covered the republican electoral states on a playground-sized topography of  the Americas. It fully encompassed our good sized kitchen table and filled the house with a heavy, meaty perfume.   Overstuffing ourselves to near sickness was a mission that instantly overtook us all. The only sounds ringing out for the next half hour would be the ripping of parchment and the chewing and tearing of four adults who had simultaneously lost their collective gastronomic willpower, and all respectable table manners.   It's hard to pinpoint exactly what makes the Vinnie pie so special. I took to the pepperoni pie especially well, and can honestly admit that my memories of devouring it are almost embarrassingly hazy, a reaction usually saved for only the most pleasurable of culinary experiences. I presume that this dreamlike state is induced due to a combination of the following elements: The baguette-style, chewy crust, buried under a copious blanket of salty, succulent pepperoni and cheese with just the right amount of tangy, savory sauce. The grease factor is simply a delicious result of the unbelievably generous pepperoni-per-square-inch ratio that is unlike any we had ever experienced. The sheer amount of thick, chopped peperoni on each slice was enough to clog your proverbial arteries with just the smell alone. Impressive.  Exhausted and over-fully satisfied an hour later, it took longer to wrap the lavish leftovers than it took to gorge ourselves past full capacity. We later lived out a delicious, gluttonous work week of leftover Vinnie pie for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, after sending the parents home with over half of the excess bounty.   Needless to say, we hope to return again for a dine-in experience at the Pizza Park, this time fully prepared after 3 days of fasting and at a time nowhere near swimsuit season.  From all of us Pittsburghers, your legacy lives on- thank you Vinnie, thank you.",

Also Ginos East in Chicago and the NYPD (In AZ)  which is the only one that makes the Sicilian style like I used to buy walking down the streets and going up to a pizza window to buy a slice.

The waitress saw her eating the food and immediately became irate and was yelling at my wife that she could not have that food there because there is a health department rule - she was so loud many other patrons looked over to see what was going on. (I later called the health department and they said they have no such rule.)  Later the waitress was trying to pass pizza's to tables out of her reach and instead of giving them to one of us to put at the table, she rammed her way through.  We spoke with manager who did nothing to rectify the situation in any meaningful way.  Service was so bad that two employees who had nothing to do with the bad experience but saw what happened, offered sincere apology on behalf the the restaurant.",

    "text": "While drinking in a brewery in Braddock, I pulled up my Yelp app and realized that Vincent's Pizza Park, a Pittsburgh icon, was only 2 miles away.  I wasn't particularly hungry but I knew by the time I got home I would be and I'd be regretting not stopping by.  So I did.  I've heard stories and seen pictures of the infamous Vinnie Pie so I was excited to see what all the fuss was about.  The dining room wasn't anything special but I was there for take out.  I ordered up a medium (I panicked and thought the small wouldn't be enough to have leftovers), half plain and half pepperoni.  I was told it would take 25 minutes but I wasn't waiting more than 20 despite the steady flow of customers who had called ahead.  I sat in the corner and peered into the kitchen, witnessing the toss the dough in the air as it was prepped for the ovens.  I watched as pies slid in the oven, rotated around and were pulled out of the ovens.  Pizza making has been mastered at Vincent's.  I was handed my order in what I like to call the \"Vinnie package.\"  My pie placed on a cardboard tray then wrapped in butcher paper and stapled at the edges.  It smelled delicious.  Once home, I unwrapped the Vinnie Pie.  Each pie that comes out of that kitchen is like a snowflake, unique in its own shape.  The bottom of the pie will inevitably have some of that black from the oven, just enough to add a little smokey taste.  There's a lot to like about a Vinnie Pie - a lot of crust (that's crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside), a lot of cheese (so much that it seems to sink towards the center), a lot of grease (that you may find absorbed into the crust).  If you're looking to eat healthy, this is not the place.    That very first bite can be difficult to handle.  Some say you need utensils but I dared to use my hands to tame the grease soaked dough and gooey cheese.  Two slices were about all I could handle until I admitted defeat.  I should have just gone with the small pie.    I noticed that many of the reviews are years old but the heart of Vincent's seems to live on.  My one star deduction is only because it felt a little pricey even after a few drinks.  But if you're looking for a pizza that's outside the box, a Vinnie Pie will satisfy.",

When the pizza finally arrived, a little over one hour later, it was massive and loaded. I was impressed and the taste was great! In the future though, I think I will try to call ahead so I'm not stuck at a table for so long. Not good when you are trying to keep two young kids tamed.",

The melting pot of a dining room was filled with all types and the rumors of cigarette ash in the sauce and a chef who'd both enter and exit the restroom with flour on his hands did nothing to deter me from consuming countless slices of this ginormous pie.  Loaded with cheese, meats and veggies, this pizza makes weight and the puddle of grease in the middle only adds convenience for crust dippers. A beautiful combination of slightly-burnt yet floury, Vinnie Pie defines pizza satisfaction. The joint has been cleaned up a bit since my youth, but you can feel the history of the place, sense the joy of diners past. I've witnessed Fed Ex men picking up pies to ship across the country.   Now, I came, I saw, I bought the shirt. Sure to be a conversation piece no matter where I go; as the Vinnie Pie is a well deserved world wide phenomenon.",

Vinnie's is very unassuming and casual from the outside, but the magic of these pizzas inside is all that you're going to care about.   This pizza is without a doubt the BEST pizza I have had in the city of Pittsburgh. I have lived here for 7 years and eaten pizza everywhere, and THIS pizza, tops EVERYTHING I have had. It was huge, it was bubbly, it was messy in the best possible way, it was overflowing with toppings, it had the most perfect dough crust bubbles, flavor and texture. AMAZING. If you have not yet experienced this pizza, you better get down to Vinnies STAT and experience it. You have to know that a place is good when they literally have ONE thing on the menu: PIZZA. No wings, stromboli, calzone or pasta here. Just pizza. And for good reason.   Luckily I went with a group of friends and got to see and eat a good variety of what they serve, Hawaiian pizza, \"the works\" pizzaa, and we had a \"medium\" (HUGE) with Canadian bacon, banana peppers, and pepperoni - one thing on the toppings here - they are not skimping on quality or amount on your pie. Our pizza was COVERED with big slices of GOOD Canadian bacon and was heavenly to say the least.   The last thing I will mention here is the \"juice\" at the bottom of your Vinnie Pie pizza pan. OMG. I am usually a hater of the pizza \"juice\", but Vinnies pizza juice is made of magic and oozing flavorful goodness. We all used the pizza juice to dip our giant pieces of soft and crusty pizza crust in. Oh lord, I am getting hungry just thinking about this.   Do yourself a favor and GET TO VINNIE'S.You will definitely not be sorry.",

The pizza really was wonderful. Maybe the best I've ever had. Toppings were overly generous, fresh, and really tasty. They only serve pizza and tossed salad, so don't go there hoping for anything else.   Now...the downside...We sat at a table and it took an hour and a half for our pizza to arrive at our table. It wasn't just us, many others waited that long. The staff seemed very unorganized. They couldn't keep track of orders and seemed to be in a fog most of the time. I observed people kneading dough, then going to the cash register handling filthy money, then back to prepping food. I observed handling of uncooked sausage with bare hands and didn't notice any hand washing going on.   This is all too bad, because the pizza was so good. However...it wasn't worth waiting THAT long for and seeing bad food prep was a turnoff. I'll stick with our local pizza shops In Bellevue. Good pizza, variety of menu, and great service.",

    "text": "Time for a confession!  Until this past weekend, I'd never heard of a Vinnie Pie.  As an East Ender who grew up outside the greater Pittsburgh region, I suppose my ignorance can be forgiven--if grudgingly.  This all changed this weekend.  My friends, who I was helping move to a new house in Turtle Creek, were looking for pizza to feed me and their other moving helpers.  One of them mentioned she'd heard there was a pretty well-known pizza place in Turtle Creek that her boss liked.  After trying unsuccessfully to look it up via Yelp (which doesn't seem to recognize Turtle Creek, PA as a distinct city), I Googled it and quickly came upon Vincent's Pizza Park.  She confirmed that was the one, and I confirmed that it had a solid 4-star rating on Yelp, so we decided to order from there.  As soon as noon struck, I called and put in an order for 5 large pizzas: One cheese, one cheeseless (for someone who doesn't eat cheese), two pepperoni, and one Hawaiian ($95 total).  Because Vincent's is a cash only establishment and doesn't deliver, we went to pick up the pizzas after allowing 20 min. for them to be constructed.  Despite our perfect timing, they only had one pepperoni pie ready for us instead of two, so we had to wait an extra 15 min. for the second pie to be made.  The pizzas came wrapped in butcher paper, rather than in cardboard boxes, which made transporting them interesting, but we managed to pull it off well.  As soon as we got the pizzas to the new home, we tore into them (both literally and figuratively) with gusto.  I had three slices, encompassing everything but the cheeseless pie.  The pepperoni was my favorite, followed by the Hawaiian and cheese, respectively, but all of them were piled with extremely generous helpings of cheese and toppings.  Because of their sheer volume, they created a significant amount of grease, which was evident both on top of and underneath the middle of the slices.  As for the crust, it was thick, chewy, and substantial on the ends, and thin in the middle, to the point that the toppings slid off in at least one case.  This was definitely one of the most uniquely crusted pizzas I've ever eaten, due to the contrast between the ends and the middle, but it somehow worked.  Between 10 people, we ate less than half of the pizza we'd ordered due to the substantiality of the slices and the humongous size of the pies.  Despite this, all of us enjoyed it very much--it certainly hit the spot after 2.5 hours of heavy lifting and running up and down stairs repeatedly!  Vinnie pies (the name for any pie ordered from Vincent's Pizza Park--not a specific type of pie) are undoubtedly one of the most unique pizzas in greater PGH.  It's crystal clear from the reviews that people either love them or hate them--fortunately, I happen to fall into the former category.  Any establishment that produces such a unique product, esp. with a common item such as pizza, earns respect from me.  If you happen to be in the area and are looking for something different--or are just really hungry, give one a try!  It certainly beats Vocelli's, which I had at my last moving party, or the national chains, hands down.",

When we walked in the place was almost empty, which is rare so we were very excited! We always get the same thing so ordering took no time at all. The place filled up as we sat. Then an hour passed and 6 tables that were empty when we got there got served before us. Our waitress came back to the table and told us our pizza was accidentally wrapped to go and it would be out in a minute. 20 minutes later, she brings us a burnt pizza. We decided not to eat it and to leave instead. She asked us to pay for our drinks, which we gladly did. But then, as if this experience could get any worse, as we were walking out she started yelling at us in front of the entire restaurant. How unprofessional can you get?! No complimentary drinks for terrible service and even more so NO APOLOGY! And then I am yelled at? Needless to say, we will never be back. Shelley Pie til we die!!!",

Vincent's excess has only one equal: Thanksgiving Thursday, 4pm. A large \"pie\" requires 4 to finish. Think Little Caeser's football field sized pizza with huge pepperoni chunks, probably a pound of cheese, and an outer crust edge alone equivalent to two loaves of bread. Salty as hell, cheesy as fuck, half-burnt and greasy enough to skip your 3,000 mile checkup; Vincent's is all things excess, nothing skimp, and nothing \"Artisan\". Just DELICIOUS.  The parlor is down to earth local charm, the slight working-class atmosphere showing it's edge. The staff push Heineken and Bud hard from tap and employ a motherly attitude calling you \"honey\" or \"sweetie.\" You'll find families looking to chat and it's likely their kids all play baseball together. No flannel or skinny jeans in sight.  Totally unique in the burgh, totally unique anywhere. Far outside downtown but you must visit once while in town. Twice might be excessive.",

Waiting 45 minutes just for drinks? Over an hour for the bill? It's madness. I have been many times, the pizza is just that good. But, last time I neared my limit. Rude staff who you can hear talking crap about the customers from the back room. Never once getting a beverage refill in over an hour. What the heck!   It's a Pittsburgh legend for a reason. Good pizza. Nobody would dare say the same for the front of house staff. There is a competitor in turtle Creek that makes similar (but not quite as good) pizza. The service and management is light years better. Drive that extra mile, safe yourself a metric ton of frustration.",

I get there an hour later and wait for about 15 min.  NO ONE acknowledged me.  I waited and waited.  I was just about to leave when someone finally asked if I had been waited on.  I said no.  She went and checked and my pizza hadn't even been made yet.  RIDICULOUS!!  I will never go back.  I don't give a shit how good it supposedly is.  And I watched 2 people complain about burnt pizza.

The place was already packed and was told it would be an hour wait, that's fine as I was waiting for the rest of my party to show. I had also ordered the pizza at that time. So an hour passes and the table behind starts complaining to the waitress that they were the first in the door and other people are getting their pizzas before them. She tried saying they had a lot of takeout orders when they opened. But people  were getting there pizzas before us who came in after us. l don't know if it was the waitress or the cooks but we ended up waiting 2 hours. The pizza is not the way I remember it there was a lot more toppings before and Vinny knew how to burn the crust just right but was still soft on the inside. Miss you Vinny",

We called our order in at 4:25pm and are given a 45 minute wait for pickup.  5:10pm our pizza is ready...WAIT! It's a blackened pizza, burnt to a crisp. Luckily we saw what was being wrapped up and could have them remake the pie.  5:25pm pizza 2 comes home with us in our pizza bag. Yes, we love pizza that much, we have a real pizza bag.   We ordered a medium pepperoni and sausage which we ate less than half of.  The crust was thick and bottom served extremely well done (burnt).  Luck of the draw; sometimes you get pepperoni slices other times shredded leftovers. The pepperoni still tasted good but doesn't stay on the pizza as nice.",

The dining room reminded me of a old school diner, but with old school decor that somewhat looked dated. I did appreciate the homage to Vincent on the wall (I've heard he used to smoke while making the pizzas); they paid tribute by framing one of his cigarettes packages.   The pizza although I can appreciate, is definitely not for me. There was tons of flavor and the pizza was very filling. However, way too much for me. WARNING, this pizza is not for the faint of heart. There's mounds of toppings; I'm pretty sure they take handfuls of toppings and just drop it onto the pizza. The crust is chewy and puffs up on the side, there's a layer of grease that piles up on the pizza from all the pepperoni that is used in the pizza. The pizza was very good however, I was not able to finish even one slice without feelings disgusted with myself afterwards.  Overall, I'd recommend this place if you're curious. You'll definitely never find another pizza elsewhere.",

    "text": "So I'll start by saying this place is cash only! This is very important information for someone like myself who hardly ever carries cash. However, with that being said... it's worth the trip to the ATM to get some cash out. No ATM on the way? It's all good, they have an ATM machine on site.   Okay, so let's talk overall experience! My fiance came here for dinner on a Sunday evening. The parking situation is a little tight by the restaurant, but we were able to find a spot. The restaurant itself is very clean and definitely had a homestyle Italian restaurant vibe to it. The building doesn't look super big on the outside, but there is a lot of seating and space inside.   Our waitress came over to us quickly and took our drink orders. She was very upfront with us and said that it would be about a 45 min wait for pizza because they were unexpectedly slammed on this day. She suggested we order a salad in the mean time, which we did.   The salad was good- your basic house salad with the regular toppings. The salad comes with or without cheese. We asked for our cheese on the side and she just brought out a big ol' bowl of cheese- which I was not mad at! Lol   Throughout our wait for pizza, our waitress came over regularly to check up on us.   Finally, it was time for our pizza. Omgosh, this pizza was something else. They don't make their pizzas into a precise circle so every pie has a slightly different shape, which I thought was cool. But my oh my, they load on the cheese, toppings, and grease. The crust was thick enough to handle all of that goodness though. In no other circumstance would I advise you to eat pizza with a knife and fork, but I definitely needed to with that pizza. This pizza was quite literally a little slice of heaven and the perfect cheat meal!   We only tackled about half of our pizza so we took the rest to go. Instead of regular pizza boxes, the place the pizza on a slab of thick and sturdy cardboard and cover it with butcher paper.   I hope you're not drooling and decide to go check out Vincent's- you won't be upset!",

    "text": "\"A little ditty about Jack and Diane...\"  Is there anything more American than washing down Vinnie pizza pies with endless refills of Pepsi products while classic rock plays on the overhead? No, there isn't, which is why we brought a bunch of international students to experience this Pittsburgh institution. We arrived at opening time (4pm), ordered an Everything But [Anchovies] and a veggie pizza to accommodate dietary restrictions, and quickly devoured a large salad with lots of cheese on top. We then made pleasant converstion for the next hour while developing our appetites. The 16-inch pies came out with impressive puffed, golden crusts and a slight char on the bottom. The grease everyone mentions in their reviews seems to come from the pepperoni, as the veggie pizza had little. Our guests declared it delicious, and the decor entertaining to boot. Cash only and worth the expense, but be prepared to wait up to two hours if you try to arrive at a \"normal\" dinner time.",

Pretty big space - lots of tables & booths & it was completely packed on a Sunday night. Considering they are cash only so they are not reporting all their income... they are racking in the (tax free) dough!   Thick & gooey. Lots of cheese. Tasty sauce. The sausage & pepperoni pizza was tasty. The sausage tastes homemade. It was immensely greasy though, pools of grease rippled through the pie. We tried to sop it up using at least 8 napkins - pools remained.   The biggest issue is it took one hour and forty five minutes to get our pizza. We should have been told this when the order was taken. Actually we didn't see our waitress for over an hour & a half - no updates on our order, no drink orders, nothing. The waitress should have greeted us & informed us the ovens were all full and would take 1.5 hours. At that time we could have decided to stay or not. There were 5 of us, and one was particularly hungry when we were seated (hadn't eaten all day). I go to Giordanos in Chicago and when you order the deep dish, they inform you of the wait time (usually 45 minutes). They have their act together. Vinny's crew apparently doesn't. There is no excuse for this.   It's a tasty pie though. Just plan your hunger level accordingly.",

Waited over 2 hours (we were told when we got there it would be a 1 hour wait) for our 2 pies, the bottoms were burnt, one of the pies had a wrong topping, and there was an older waitress parading around the restaurant profanely complaining about customers.   Our waitress was exceptional given her working conditions, not her fault that management seemed to be nonexistent.  Not sure if this is accurate, but it looked like take-out pizzas were being prioritized over dining patrons.  We waited patiently, ate our pizza, paid and left.  Not sure we'll be returning unless they figure out how to run the operation more efficiently/professionally and bake the pies like Vinnie used to (why are the bottoms burnt!)

Location is sort of a pain in the butt with pulling in and out, but the restaurant itself is pretty nice. It's usually not overly busy, since most people seem to pickup and takeout, so dining in is nice and typically an option. Oh and it's got a small bar at the location as well.

I would post pics but was so pissed it's already in the trash, AND the guy that took the money had gloves on and dug thorough the register with the gloves on.  Did he change them? Who knows.  Disgusting!!! We used to have a good experience here.  The last time the pizza wasn't great but we decided to give it another try.  Never will we order from here again.  Complete disaster.",

If you choose to visit on a Friday or Saturday please realize that you will have a wait.   During my visit last night I witnessed a customer that had a temper tantrum after waiting an hour and 10 minutes. This customer actually left without their pizza and did not want to pay for their salad and drinks that they already consumed. We sat down before them and were told the wait is about and hour and a half. Our pizza arrived right about the hour and a half mark and it was fantastic. Same as it has been since Vinnie was alive! Although, you can now get 1/2 toppings.  If you are in Pittsburgh you need to try this pizza and as we call it the pizza gravy (the pepperoni grease).",

Just like the way I recall it years ago when Vinnie did the pizza tossing.  It's been a few plus years since I had a Vinnie Pie and I was  pleased and very happy to see the new interior along with the thriving business on a rainy Wednesday night.  The dining area is clean, comfortable and great for a dining party of one or for accommodating a much larger group.  Their menu suggests that they understand what simple means and that simple works!   They serve pizza.  They serve salad. They serve alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  That's it. Perfect.  A small, plain pizza (believe me this does not appear small at all!) starts at $10.00 and leads all the way up to the biggest pie called the Works and is a large priced at 35.25.  May the Vinnie Pie live on! I look forward to another great night at Vincent's.  Bring cash, though there is an ATM on-site.",

While most pizza in Pittsburgh is more or less \"new york style\", Vincent's pizza is anything but \"thin crust\" - a big, thick (but not heavy - lots of air in there) bubbling crust with an awesome char, balanced with just the right amount of toppings.  Sausage is a particular stand-out topping - big pieces that would only work on Vinnie's crust with lots of great fennel flavor.  Meatball sub is tasty and weighs something like 20 lb.  This is the best pizza in Pittsburgh (sorry Mineo's/Aiello's), and my favorite pizza anywhere.",

The servers are rude - cutting in front of a woman with a cane nearly knocking her over, slamming chairs into tables to get to seat people. Tables are dirty - we sat during dinner looking at five tables in our eyesight of uncleared tables - while folks sat and waited to be seated the whole time. Our server never brought menus and couldn't remember our order - one pizza two toppings.  Then when we brought our pizza home to reheat the next day, we found it was someone else's.  Gross!

The amount of cheese and toppings easily overwhelms the structural integrity of the bottom crust, but that's why you need to eat it on a plate with a knife and fork. The size of the pizza is generous and so are the toppings they put on it. The cheese tasted pretty fresh and there was lots of it. I really like how the pepperoni on our pizza was cut thickly. The overall taste of the pizza seemed fresh and special, not like from a chain or from any common pizza place. When dining in, they only have canned/bottled drinks, so no free refills, but the staff were really courteous and made sure we were doing fine. Very casual, cash only, pizza sold in whole pies only (no pizza-by-the-slice). Overall, worth a try for a different kind of pizza in the 'burgh.",

Before I get to the pizza itself, let's talk about the establishment. The place smelled like a toilet. The bathroom itself smelled better than the dining room, and we would have considered taking our dinner in there if we thought it would have solved the problem. Unfortunately the pizza didn't salvage the experience. Sure there was a lot of it, and all description of its largess were accurate, but it was far from good and miles from the best in Pittsburgh, let alone the world/universe. Having a lot of a bad thing doesn't make it good. The sauce had almost no flavor and the cheese just fell off in clumps. If you want cheap cheesy pizza, you're better off going to Costco; it's not good pizza, but it's better than this.  I rarely regret eating  pizza, but my trip to Vincent's has left me wishing that I wouldn't have been duped by the crazy reviewers whose comments lured me there in the first place.

My wife likes veggie pizzas and I like meaty ones. We split a half spinach/half pepperoni and sausage pizza. There was so much meat, I felt like I'd fallen into a Man vs Food episode.  The people who go there are like my relatives in W/PA.   They make it memorable, like the wedding scene from the Deer Hunter.  This isn't some yuppie, Neapolitan, truffle oil infused, arugula and chicken mole monstrosity conjured up by  someone pretending to make pizza.  The crust is great, the sauce is good.

    "text": "Oh man, I can't believe this place isn't on Yelp yet.  There aren't enough good things to be said: this place defines Pittsburgh pizza, and remains the best I've ever had.  That's after living in both Chicago and New York--I order a Vinnie pie every time I'm visiting the Burgh.  Vincent himself is a big, burly, old-school pizza-joint guy.  There was usually a cigarette dangling from his lips while he tossed the dough, but that makes for character--growing up, there was always a dumb but entertaining rumor that the oven-blackened flour on the bottom of each pizza was ash from the cigarettes.  They've had the same location for years, just between East Pittsburgh and Forest Hills.  I think Vincent retired, but they still do things the same: enormous pizzas (if a bit expensive, but again, they're enormous) with cheese piled on top of a thick, slightly doughy (but in a good way) crust.  The toppings are piled on even more thickly, especially the pepperoni (my favorite) which comes in meaty chunks instead of thin, round slices.    As soon as you get home and tear through the paper wrapper -- only the bottom half of the box here -- you're in for something awesome.  Lots of people come here to eat in-house too, where the dark walls give it a cool, slightly seedy feeling similar to a pool hall.  For some reason there's been a proliferation of other pizza places trying to steal some of Vincent's good name, but those places (PNC Park in particular) suck.  Be sure you only go to this one.  You won't regret it.",

    "text": "Vinnie Pie...The one and only! From time to time, I've been dismayed to read reviews from pizza lovers who did not like the Vinnie Pie. Then one day I had an epiphany. To compare a Vinnie Pie to an ordinary pizza is just not a reasonable comparison.  A Vinnie Pie is not really a pizza; it is something very different, its own unique thing. It's a Vinnie Pie. It might even be its own food group.  Those with OCD or those who are expecting a neat little pizza with neatly organized toppings and a uniform crust should not even go near this restaurant. A Vinnie Pie is pure entropic chaos on a platter.  A Vinnie Pie is so chaotic that nobody makes a box that will contain it. Instead, they make their own takeout package consisting of a giant slab of cardboard wrapped with white butcher paper over the top.   The ingredients are the finest and freshest and that's one of the key elements that make a Vinnie Pie such an awesome sensory experience. I suspect there are other secrets known only to a select few.  Beyond that, words fail me on describing the Vinnie Pie itself. If you want to know more of what it's like, read the review by Darren W. His review comes closer than any words I can write.  The rest of this review is a self-endulgent trip down memory lane. I grew up in Forest Hills, but I left in 1980 along with everyone else. Now imagine it's 1979 and you're a 17-year old with the munchies. And you end up at Vincent's Pizza Park on a Saturday night. I can still see Vince behind the glass, flour in his hair, his glasses fogged with even more flour, a glass of beer on the counter, and the ubiquitous cigarette in the corner of his mouth. We used to speculate that cigarette ash was the secret ingredient. Those images are laser-etched in my brain.  I don't get to Pittsburgh very often any more, but I did get to stop in for a Vinnie Pie a couple of months ago.  I was pleased to see that the place looked pretty much the same. Of course, Vince is gone now. I've heard people say that the pizza isn't as good at it used to be, but to me, it seemed just as good as ever.  Rest in peace Vincent Chianese. The man may be gone, but his legend and legacy remain.",

I dig the old school feel of the place however the restaurant smells like a dirty bathroom.  There's just a lingering odor there that it just plain gross.    So how's the pizza?  In appearance you'll see that the cheese is piled high, the toppings even higher, and it's surrounded by huge helping of dough.  However you'll find a lake of grease surrounding the pizza, there's a TON of it.  The amount of grease is so immense that eating a slice gives me a huge headache.  Ditto on the amount of pepperoni.  Trying not to choke on handful of cheese and drown in grease while eating makes the experience far less enjoyable.  However they do get 2 stars because their dough is fantastic, but that's about it.",

    "text": "I dislike writing reviews like this, I really do. I will not, however, shy away from what I see as my duty as a dedicated Yelper to give my opinion simply because a restaurant has been around a long time and is beloved by some of the local population. This pizza is not to my liking. The crust was overly doughy and tasteless. There was not enough sauce and way, way too many toppings and cheese. We ordered a large pie with half black olives and mushrooms, half green olives and roasted red pepper. The amount of olives, mushrooms and peppers on the pizza was simply overkill...more is not better, and they don't get that. If they were bothering to really look at what they were sending out of the kitchen here, they would see that loading a pizza with an overabundance of toppings creates pools of liquid that are unappetizing; the dough gets drenched and soggy and nothing crisps up and caramelizes. The cheese was barely melted and hardened as we ate it...again, there was just too much of it. Some people may be pleased and gratified by what they perceive as the abbondanza of this pizza, that luxurious sense of abundance that comes from getting just a bit more than one needs. They've gone beyond that into the ridiculous here, and have created a product that is not well balanced, not tasty, just not good.",

CONS: eh, not much for atmosphere.  Think:  \"hole-in-the-wall dive-bar\" meets \"Pizza shop\". It is a bit pricey No credit cards the last time we were there.  When you order toppings, Vinnie does NOT skimp on them!!! If you order Sausage, they practically throw meatballs on your pizza!  TIP:  The \"Vincents Pizza\" @ PNC Park, is not the same thing!  Do not be fooled by imitators! The only authentic \"Vinnie's Pizzas\" are located on Rt. 30. (This location plus one in Norwin--again, both are right on Rt. 30)",

    "text": "I was over at a friend's to watch the Superbowl, and another friend was supposed to be bringing the pizza. We were like, wtf, what is taking so long to get pizza? So we call and he's like, \"I'm getting some special pizza. It'll be worth it.\" He finally showed up with not a pizza box, but a slab of cardboard wrapped in a sheet of white paper. I've eaten a lot of pizza, but a pizza that can't even be contained within a pizza box? I knew some ridiculousness was ahead of us.  This so-called special pizza was Vincent's. It was pretty special, indeed. In my mind, there's two categories of pizza: authentic Italian-style pizza, and cheap takeout pizza. Vincent's is one of the best examples I've had of the latter type. This is a cheese-lovers' pizza for sure. Massive globs of milky mozzarella cheese cover the pizza. I'm not sure if the cheese is homemade, but it had a tangy taste that usually comes from a fresh mozzarella. The water seeps out of the cheese and collects in the center of the pizza, which is a characteristic of traditional Neopolitan-style pizza. Probably not everyone's cup of tea, but personally, I love myself a pizza with a soupy center. And while normally I like a New York style thin crust on my cheap pizza, Vincent's bready crust is the perfect complement to its over-the-top cheesiness.  Vincent's strikes me as a hybrid between traditional pizza techniques and the good ol' American appetite, and they definitely make it work for them. As a little pizza-obsessed Italian girl, I'm very glad I was introducted to Vincent's. I wish they delivered, but then again, I would probably be eating greasy pizza every day, so it's probably for the best.",

    "text": "This pizza is amazing!  We got the pepperoni and mushroom, and I'm thinking that it was easily 2.5 lbs of toppings. People, this pizza made its own broth.  A medium is way more than enough for two people...and we ate so much that we didn't need to eat again for a good 30 hours or so.    I have to take off a star for environmental concern.  1) There was an ant colony running around my table, and 2) the place was FULL of screaming kids.  I know that's not the restaurant's fault but it was pretty distracting.  However, I will definitely come back to have more of the world's best pizza...as soon as I run out of my current supply of leftovers.  And this time...I will get it to go.",

A large bubbly crust slightly charred and a heavy cheesy pie teeming with condiments was as tasty as ever.  Our only complaint was the service.  I called in for this pizza to go and my wife went in to pick it up .  There was no one at the counter and she kept calling for someone's attention .  It took almost 10 minutes for someone to come from the back room and give my wife a pizza that was sitting on the shelf.  If Vincent's wants to gain back the business they lost to Shelly Pie during remodeling this better be an isolated incident.",

    "text": "I finally tried this pizza last night with a few of my co-workers.   If this were a Silver Age Lee/Kirby comic book monster tale, my review would be titled...  \"WE FOUGHT MONZZZTERRELLA, THE LIVING PIZZA THAT TOOK OVER PITTSBURGH!\"   Let me preface this by saying that I am a lifelong South Hills resident but have known of this restaurant for years only through word of mouth (hushed tones?)and a featurette on our local PBS affiliate.   They don't make pizzas like Vincent's in the South Hills.   No pizza place I know of has a picture of the owner on its sign.   Ours are neatly made, respectable.   Vincent's pizza comes from Hell.   This is a pizza made by a madman, a lunatic, a megalomaniac. H.P. Lovecraft would have written of it. Black Sabbath may have composed \"E5150\" because of it.   The crust is bloated, deformed and threatens to usurp the rest of the pie. It almost...pulsates. The toppings and cheese are seemingly put on the pizza by a 12 foot tall ogre via a \"grab and throw\" technique .    There's no rhyme or reason to the fixings. We got our pizza with \"the works.\" The toppings were scattered, splattered like the innards of mutilated cattle. The pie could not contain them. The spare toppings alone could have made for a meal. That's how much material is piled onto the pizza, and it's all quite literally PILED onto the pizza. The toppings have a life of their own. They scuttle off of the pizza and onto the table like parasites clinging to and falling off of what the Army would call a \"Large Scale Aggressor.\"   The bottom of the pie is thin, crisp and has a brimstone flavor.   This is a pizza borne of the devil's fire.  Each slice slithers off of the warped pan and onto your plate, leaving its entrails behind.  But I implore you, for the love of all that is holy and of the light, do not try to pick up this pizza and eat it. Use silverware and make sure your knife and fork are each blessed by a priest. This pizza will devour the poor soul that tries to tackle it unarmed.   Determining when and where the pizza ends is a mystery. It's a lost world unto itself, complete with an underground lake of broth (grease?) that beckons you...  ...to dip your crust into it.   I feared for the safety of the lovely, innocent brunette who waited on us.  She is not working there willfully. She couldn't be. Someone must be keeping her soul in a jar.  Or was she a siren, lulling us into a False sense of security and then leading us into doom with her charm?    I was totally unprepared. This isn't a pie that one could even conceive of having delivered. I wouldn't dare take it home. I wouldn't want the accursed, powerful thing in my house. It might eat the cats.   They wrap it in paper, as if they know that this beast of burned dough, bloody sauce, lumpy, piquant meat,  maniacally chopped vegetables and oozing, sentient, alien symbiote cheese cannot be contained by anything. Keeping it in a cardboard box would be futile. Its hot, acidic juices alone would...  The horror! It's best not to think of it without holding a rosary or another holy artifact.  I still say that Bellisario's Pizza in Baldwin is the zenith of Pittsburgh pies. Theirs is a righteous, noble pizza that is made by those stout of heart. It is the Beowulf of pizzas. Vincent's is a terrifying hybrid of Grendel and the Frankenstein Monster. Bellisario's would slay this creature, but it would be a narrow and costly victory.   A masterpiece of culinary evil is what we found, and we barely survived the encounter, foolhardy interlopers that we were.   I'm still downing Tums in an attempt to exorcise it. It's inside me, threatening to get out, getting in my head, telling me to go back and have some more.",

    "text": "The one and only Vincent's.  Accept no substitutes.  It's not often that I throw down the coveted 5 stars for a dive pizza joint, but just to show how good it is, Vincent's is a 45 minute drive, each way, from my in-laws house, and I go there pretty much every time I'm back in the Burgh.  I grew up in New York, so I'm pretty serious about my pizza pie, but Vincent's is without a doubt the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure it's the only destination pizza joint I have in my repertoire (aside from Lou Malnati's in Chicago, but that's not really pizza...).  I always get the same thing when I come here, the Everything, But... (pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, onion, god knows what else... everything, but anchovies).  It comes with enough toppings for 5 pizzas.  The hardest part is letting it sit at the table long enough to cool down to a consumable temperature.  My favorite is to dip the crust in the leftover juices on the pan from all of the toppings.  Be warned, it takes a bit of time to cook (this ain't Little Ceasar's), which I think adds to the experience.    Last time I was there, they had added some new beers on tap (available in pitchers), including Magic Hat, which is nice.  If all else fails, nothings beats a Vincent's pie and a pitcher of Yuengling.  Nothing fancy.  Just good pizza and cold, frosty beer, done right.",
