It's puzzling because the beer selection is extensive.  The menu is above average, as is the food.  Lots of pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers.    BUT, who wants to go home smelling like a filthy ashtray?  It would be great if they joined the rest us in the twenty-first century.",

I sat at the bar and ordered the hardwood salmon with a salad. The salad was good but I felt the salmon was overdone although the cedar plank glaze they used was very tasty. The service was not overly friendly but not rude either. I think I just came at the wrong time where apparently more attention was paid to the band. Overall it seems like it might be a fun place (the crowd is a bit older) but the food experience was not the best. That tasty glaze on the salmon brings it up to 3 stars.",

Typical bar type setup, TVs, music over the jukebox, etc.  First timer here, so I went with basic wings and a 8\" buffalo chicken pizza.  The wings were decent, and I appreciate the fact that they were not smothered in sauce.  My pizza however was fan-freaking-tactic.  I got in late (10:30 pm) and was worried the grill would be closed.  I'm sure glad it was not.  Now if my hotel only would have a mini fridge to put my leftovers in, I would have been eating the rest of the pie while typing this review.",

That grill made me a wonderful little pizza that no other dive in the neighborhood could produce.  Outshining the pizza was the sauce that my Hot Garlic Parm wings came in- absolutely killer.  I sopped up what was left on the plate with my pizza crust.  So yes, I was pleasantly suprised.  other pros include a super decent draft list. overall a big yum.  BUT- there is one DEAL-BREAKER in store for you cigarette-haters, and that is that they've found a loophole in the smoking law and allow smoking throughout the whole building.  A little off-putting and weird even for smoker.  I don't particularly want to breathe smoke while savoring my amazing wings.  I felt stuck in the '90's again.",

    "text": "The Hop House  Wood Fired Food & Ale  The Hop House was \"The Idlewood Inn\" when my adventure in PHX began 2 years ago. Personally, I like The Hop House better. It's a place with a Brick-Oven behind the bar and over 20 Drafts, good stuff. If you like tasty beer, then The Hop House should be a stop for you. They have sampler racks that are $5 for 6-3 oz. samples of  your choice or theirs. My Favs there: Dogfish 60 min IPA, Magic Hat #9 and of course, Yuengling :D The bartenders are knowledgeable about the ales and lagers being served, which is nice considering the broad selection available. Darts, a pool table and plenty of big screen TV's are abound. Occasional Live Bands, Happy Hour Specials, Texas Hold'em Night, Free Pizza and other goodies are normal here. The food here is of so-so quality, nothing too grand, even though there is a wood fired oven. I went here recently with a friend that totally hated her dinner, I wish I could recall what she had, but mine was fine(I had $8 Small Buffalo Chicken Pizza,SuPrIsE). I can't decide if they are slightly over-priced or if their portions are  too small (-1). I mean, you expect to pay more at a place like this, right?  It seemed like The Idlewood was more of a Workingman's-T-Shirt and Jeans kinda place when I stopped the few times before, whereas it's definitely an office crowd now mostly everyone seems to be wearing a collar. I like it, I have a collar, I'm going back.  I Added a pic above of a great bargain and way to find new brews: Sampler Rack, get one!",

First off, the beer list is huge- I'm talking dozens of taps filled with local and craft brew that is always rotating. You won't long for a good beer in just about every style.  As for food, The Hop House is consistently good. I love their pasta (all you can eat on Thursdays!), and their ribs and pizza are above average. The sandwiches are also good, especially the \"Secret Club,\" a tastey sandwich that included bacon, turkey, special \"secret sauce\" on ciabatta bread- yum.  The portions are huge, the side choices plentiful, the staff is great, and there's always a game or two on their plethora of flat screen TVs. More then a bar, less then a fancy restaurant, you can feel comfortable watching the Pens game in your jersey with your buddies or bringing your mom for a nice dinner- as long as you don't mind the smoking.",

Other than that - a HUGE selection of domestics and imports at really really really reasonable prices. The dinner appeased everyone in our group - there really is something for everyone: the nacho/wing lover can have her fix, the steak and potatoes lover can be very satisfied, and the fish/veggies girl can get her fix. Everything was cooked perfectly, and we all loved the sweet potato hash (a home-fries type of thing with white and sweet potatoes).   The waitress was nice and knowledgeable and honest about the beers and the menu, and was dead on with her personal recommendations.   As we were leaving, they were setting up for their live band set  - it's a kind of tight space for the dining room, so I'm guessing it was going to be very loud and unfriendly to conversations (while we were there the jukebox was playing some current pop/hip hop/ great rock and the noise level was just above a regular conversation level).  All in all - nice place, and worth the trip from down town, definitely",

I usually get bar food, like mozzarella sticks, but the last order we got was sitting in a pool of grease, not drained completely before being put in the basket. The bartender even said \"Ew!\" when she took it away. The next time I tried the salmon salad--surprisingly very good! I wouldn't associate this place with seafood but it hit the spot and the salad was large. The bartenders/servers are always super friendly. Sometimes a little distracted at the bar talking to people. This one seems bigger than the North Hills one and has outdoor seating, but I've had better food at that location. The smoke doesn't bother me, but I can see that being a downside for others. At both locations the restroom is blindingly bright. It's an odd observation but it annoys me nonetheless.",

    "text": "First the good news: The beer list is extensive with 36 beers (domestic and international). They offer a 6-beer sampler and you can pick any of the 36 beers. The food is upscale bar food and is tasty. The atmosphere is young (under 30) and there is certainly a vibe to the place for those who like beer houses. Second the not-so-good news: it's a smoking restaurant throughout (no cigars) so if you have trouble eating in a smoke-filled restaurant, stay away. The atmosphere is loud so you'll need to raise your voice to carry on a conversation. Third the bad news: Our order was the one that was going to be screwed up that night. We waited 45 minutes for our order. I think we would still be waiting if we didn't flag down our waitress. THEN they brought the wrong order! I am not making this up. The waitress said the wrong meal had been put into the computer. This meant back to kitchen while the sides they brought out just sat there getting cold. The second order (another 15 minutes) was the right item but in their hurry it was missing items. Told the waitress but was not going to send it back. So it was an hour to get our dinner. WAY too long. No manager came over to apologize. The waitress did remove one of the dinner items off the bill. Small consolation for an hour wait, the wrong meal, cold sides, now-warm beer which we had ordered to be delivered with dinner but they came 30 minutes early and then the right meal with missing items. Without the mix-up, I rate this higher. The beer theme is pretty neat, but two stars is generous given our fiasco.",

The fries were so overdone there was no potato left inside. They were charred shells. The cheese wasn't melted and the lettuce was brown. The following week my chicken salad was the same way. I used to come here all the time for lunch, but now I'm definitely reconsidering.   I also wish they didn't allow smoking. It's so smokey in there you come out smelling like an ashtray.

Delirium Tremons and Delirium Noctorum are great beers, but be careful these 10% ABV beers will get to you.  Compare to bars in SF and LA, the prices at this bar are dirt cheap.

Grilled chicken salad -bland chicken, barely any veggies, and forgot fries(no biggie but it just added to the terrible experience that day ). My friend had a cheesesteak wrap which had literally two bite size pieces of steak. I am not one to complain and pretty easy going, but this was just downright terrible. Sorry hop house but we miss the old place...not sure if new management or ownership but two thumbs down!!",

Wings are amazing! However, they do not offer the same fantastic flavors as their other restaurant in the north hills. Long story short, the north hills one is better, I won't be back to this location as long as that one is still around.",

They had a decent Lenten menu featuring peirogies and lobster mac and cheese.   My coworker said their salsa was really good so I went with the vegetable quesadillas. Very generous salsa and sour cream portions, and that is always a plus! But that's as good as it got... the quesadilla itself wasn't very good... carrots? I realize it was veggies, just never had carrots on it before.   I'm sure this is a great place for drinks, they appeared to have great drink specials as well but I wouldn't recommend it for a dining experience. Our bartender/server kept coming over with super cheesy lines, it was very awkward. Probably wouldn't be as awkward at night while drinking.. or if you're a yinzer.",

We ate on the patio, which was an entertaining experience for the eavesdropping it allowed us to do.  Nice view of the sunset, too.   We ordered some wings and I had the chicken salad, which intrigued me because \"fries\" were listed as an ingredient.  It was HUGE.  And the lettuce was all excellent quality.  The ranch dressing was delicious and it was hugely satisfying.  The Hendrick's gin-lemonade I had was good, too.  I hear the wings were tasty but I didn't try them.   When we went inside to pay and use the restroom, it did smell smoky but it wasn't a big deal.  I would have eaten inside happily, and I come from a place where there's been a smoking ban everywhere for years so I'm definitely not used to it or anything.  It looks like they have Team Trivia on Thursdays!  We were bummed we wouldn't be in town for that.  The service was a little bit slow to start, but the server seemed apologetic and after that she was reasonably attentive.    I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who was looking for a low-key local place to eat in the area.",

We recently ordered the Ahi tuna salad which was large and filling but the tuna was not as fresh and flavorful as I would have liked it to be. The stuffed banana peppers were tasty and hot.   It is rather on the dark side for dining. More of a bar scene lighting. Difficult to read the menu. Many bar stool seating, not enough table seating. I didn't notice the smoke this time, but on other occasions there was so much smoke in the room it was hard to even enjoy a meal.  Service was very friendly and attentive.   A decent place for a lunch with average bar food. Prices are reasonable and what you would expect, but does not really stand out anymore with so many other options around the area.",

We arrived2 hours early from the band's start time in order to have a great seat, and to have a dinner meal.  Service was fast and excellent.  We were seated to the right of the stage (as one looks at it), close to a waitstaff staff.  Food was good -- service as excellent.  As the band came in and unloaded, the wait staff appeared to be less interested but still just fine as an experience.  No break between the dinner and then live performance venue.  Betty (Marca) and the band came in and set up.  I asked the lead guitarist if I could take photographs.   He said yes though I am sure he did not intend or mean \"400 images with flash.  The band was seasoned -- professional.  A great venue for anyone who enjoys live music, blues, performed by adept performers.    Nice place.  Need GPS to get there.  Great parking in the back.  Band is local and established.   Food is basic bar food.   A nice afternoon early evening venue.  Bar is nicely separated from the music area.  Roy",

It was for the incredibly incandescent and tempting food, of course.   Yes, I did reference the primoridial element that has advanced us as a species...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoGdarQGuNeo&s=310b559332cd6b1a5d9c5ec20d425687689983ba1573eb94383ea36286cdf04c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=oGda...</a>  My weekend crusade of crushing burgers continued compulsively, carnally as if I was channeling a long-dead barbarian who wanted me to...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVVhuUNUmMnI&s=e85c5f0f924ef2da3bb7fab98d6f9241b929a757c04fbd7d6a6f3cbfbfa0a36f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=VVhu...</a>  A half-pound of Hell awaited me at the Hop House like the Minotaur did for Theseus.   Adorned with a cape of molten cheddar, painted martially with an ensanguined BBQ sauce (blood of its enemies?), and armed with onion straws, bacon, and a dill pickle strap, the substantial, medium-rare patty came clad in a flaky, downy bun.   With the first bite, I knew that I held a champion in my hands, one that was flanked by an army of terrifically battered and fried tater sticks.   The burger was akin to a birthday cake of minced beef. The BBQ sauce had a sweetness and twang to it that made it akin to a melted-down Jolly Rancher candy. The onion straws brought a crunchy texture. The bacon added fatty and salty heft. The cheddar tried in vain to cut everything as the dill pickle was merely there to make things more interesting. The skin of the bread...crumbled while keeping the burger as a whole intact...somehow.   Disarmed, defeated, delightful, this was a brutal burger for our time, for all time.   A generous helping of cole slaw acted as a crisp, cool respite as I did battle out on the patio on a brisk Friday evening, the wind chilling my bones, the food bracing me up, the cheers of Penguins fans tricking me into thinking that they were an audience for the gladiatorial spectacle I was embroiled in.   Having mentioned that, we only went outside since the interiors were packed and seating was at a premium. I think they could have afforded to put a space heater out there or at least lit the dormant oven that stood nearby. Nonetheless, our magnificent meal was capped off by a fried, astutely plated cheesecake that is called Xango and was Hop House's lone dessert.  As if cheesecake wasn't decadent enough, plunging it into hot oil encased in a pastry dough only serves to make it more depravedly delicious, and this was no omission. There's nothing like the sensation of crunching through a shell-like coating with your teeth to unleash a combination of sugar and cream that floods your entire palate, sticking to your tongue and the ceiling of your mouth...   The Hop House needs no other dessert, but YOU, the diner needs to make your way to the West End so as to sample dishes that are brushed by blazing embers stoked by masters of their craft and cuisine.",

It is smoker friendly, but they have a ventilation system. I usually get a wrap, stromboli, quesadilla, or Italian hoagie. All are pretty good.",

Cooked the best it could have but the food quality was poor. Runny blue cheese, wings with very little meat and my potatoes skins were thin as I was when I was 14. Must have used the meat of the potatoes for yesterday's potato soup!    Won't be going back. Not will I recommend yo",

    "text": "I used to go here often when smoking was standard in all bars/restaurants around Pittsburgh. I stopped going when they refused to become non-smoking about 10 years ago. The place is honestly disgusting inside - it's so hard to breathe.   Last evening, a friend suggested we go there and sit on the patio. I agreed because I wouldn't have to go inside. We called ahead and let them know that about 11 of us would be there. What a mistake. It was literally the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Jess W. was also a part of my party and she sums the evening up much better than I can in her review.   I only want to say that you should run very very far away from this place. My friends and I were calm and understanding with our incompetent waiter and lack of correct food and drinks for the first 2.5 hours we were there. When our waiter went off the deep end there should have been a manager there to sort everything out. I am appalled by the way we were treated and more appalled that this restaurant somehow manages to stay open.   They will never have my business again. Nor any of my friends.   And finally, once again,  it's smoking. So even if you think I'm just a disgruntled person ranting, and even if the food and service were fair/good (they were both so so so so bad) -  I would tell any nonsmoker to avoid.",

The main reason it was a gathering place for us is because it was so close to our office. Another positive factor is the size. It's a large facility.  However, service is less than average. When it gets busy the workers really seem to get confused and unable to do more than one thing at a time. I've witnessed outright rude treatment of customers.  Pretty sure the food is frozen, packaged stuff from a big processed food provider. That's what it tastes like.   Can't see myself ever going back.",

The beer lines are not cold enough and they cleanly have not been cleaned.  My beer was warm had a ton of head and tastes like the last beer that was in the line, something with lime.

    "text": "I actually can't believe the horrible experience I just had at this place. It was my first time going and most definitely my last. I was with a group of 11 people - when we arrived there were only two other people in the restaurant, so they were clearly not busy.  The waiter - JEFF - seemed to have some extreme difficulty writing down our orders. He came back a couple times saying they were out of things and asking to clarify a couple of our orders. It took a very long time to get our drinks. After putting down a draught beer for one of my friends Jeff said \"that might taste weird, we get a lot of complaints that the taps are flat and warm. I meant to tell you when you ordered but didn't.\" Lo & behold, the beer definitely had a weird taste. So...thanks for that, Jeff. Drinks trickled in throughout our stay, but we often had to ask for things at least twice. Jeff came back at some point and said \"i wrote down that someone ordered chicken fries but we don't sell that\" so we had to go around AGAIN to give him our orders. OBVIOUSLY NO ONE ORDERED CHICKEN FRIES. It took over an hour for food to start trickling in. Two people in my party never even received their meals.  Others had sides missing. Whole thing was a mess. I should note that the entire night Jeff Kent's saying \"I'm doing my best.\" You clearly weren't, Jeff. We finally ask for our checks and a ridiculous amount of time passed before a couple people went in asking what's going on. A girl appeared to be handling the checks and said they'd be out in a couple of minutes. More & more time passes so I finally went in asking what was going on. This girl was also clearly having difficulty because it appears Jeff didn't write anything down properly. I said that we were all going to leave soon and Jeff said \"you are NOT leaving without paying, that is stealing!\" And I said \"you didn't even bring half our food out.\" Jeff literally went from 0 to 100 and pointed at me yelling \"You are a fucking piece of trash! You're the most disgusting person I've ever met! You are trash!\" Jeff, not sure if you could hear or see yourself, but I certainly wasn't the piece of trash in this scenario. The manager on duty (bartender) was called over. She said she told Jeff to leave for the night. I said that I would hope he'd be fired for talking to me like that but she said she doesn't have that power because she's not actually a manager. So that was helpful. No one offered to comp us for anything, the \"manager\"/bartender did not apologize. The girl helping with the checks wasn't even working apparently, she just happened to stop in. She did not offer to comp us so I told her I would not be paying for anything I got. I've never been treated like this anywhere ever. Based on most other reviews, this place is a disaster and shouldn't be in operation. At the very least I hope they fire Jeff and he considers another occupation because he clearly is not a waiter. P.S. the food I did get was horrible. A \"medium\" hamburger should not be hard as a hockey puck.",

The Buffalo chicken dip, the reason I ate there, had no sign of Buffalo, at first glance I confused it with the macaroni and cheese. It was as bland as the rest of the order. As if that wasn't enough the order of pierogis were way past date. I'd guess they were boiled about a week ago, then cooled improperly, then rotated improperly, and even still served to my wife. After we each ate 1. I inspected the pierogis under better lite not only were they hard in spots and not fried only boiled. They had a sweet flavor to them and under better light were gray.
