    "text": "Incredibly authentic Italian cuisine. If your looking for a memorable spot with some of the most delicious actually Italian dishes then look no further than Alla Famiglia. This is a restaurant to celebrate an occasion at such as New Years, Valentines Day, Anniversaries,etc.  my girlfriend and I came here for New Year's Eve and we could not have enjoyed it more. To start we had the Alla Famiglia Meatball. I couldn't get over the rich tomato sauce that the meatball was surrounded in and the smoothness of the actual meat. Just delicious, must have. When you order an entree you also get their house salad served in a homemade Italian vinaigrette (light and complimenting to the diverse salad topped with great peppers!) and their Penne Alla Vodka. This pasta dish alone is enough to warrant a visit . I am a alla vodka lover and this is the best I've ever had. It's hard to describe but its not to rich or creamy it's absolutely just right. The pasta itself was so smooth and melted in your mouth with their sauce.  For entree my girlfriend had their Ahi Tuna Steak (special). Prepared perfectly and with a great lemon butter sauce. I had their speciality, their double cut Veal Chop. This is something straight out of The Flintstones in its portion but let me tell you it's with every penny. I had the Veal Chop Pizzoaloa style wivh was with hot & sweet peppers, a great tomato sauce covered in provolone cheese. This was such a moist Veal Chop that literally fell off the bone and with the marbling it just melted in your mouth.  Everything was spectacular , it's a restaurant you have to visit if your in the area at least once given you are willing to spend for your meal. $$$$ but you absolutely get what you pay for.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I stumbled across this hidden gem in Pitt, and he's lived there for almost 2 years. We both literally could not recommend this place enough.  We came in and were welcomed warmly and our table wasn't quite ready yet, so we waited about 15 extra minutes. That's the only real thing here. But, we made our reservation an hour before coming on a Friday night on a whim, and they offered us a seat at the bar and led the way beautifully. The service performed by the wait staff was impeccable. Don't be fooled by the small room upon entering the restaurant- the place has 3 floors. We were seated by a beautiful window in a quiet room upstairs. The second floor room is where the bar is. The ambiance is beautiful, quaint and romantic.   When we got to the table, we both could not believe how unbelievable the spread was. Delicious extra virgin olive oil that tasted as if it had just been squeezed out of the olive itself, seasoned fresh, whipped butter, cheese cubes and parmesan. I highly recommend the olive oil with parmesan for your bread dipping. Since we are students, we came not planning to spend $100 on dinner. Well, okay. We stuck to the appetizer side of the menu, and while the entree side was much pricier, each entree comes with penne vodka and salad as well (lots of bang for your buck). We ordered 3 appetizers to share and had plenty of food, and half of one left over. The meatball was absolutely divine.. amazing sauce, the most tender beef, and mozzarella and parmesan both stuffed inside, and on top. The calamari was sauteed and was surprisingly delicious, and far superior to any fried calamari we've ever had. The shrimp that came with the dish were jumbo, and both were in a wonderful, garlicky sauce with a hint of red pepper flakes. Perfection. The mozzarella tomato caprese had cheese that melted in your month. The presentation was also incredible. Finally, we ended with the raspberry tiramisu which was just delightful. I would have loved to have ordered a cappuccino as well (it smelled heavenly downstairs) but it was pretty late when we left.   This is the kind of restaurant where everything you order is stellar quality. It is well worth the price for the food that you get, and the appetizers were extremely reasonably priced and portioned largely. We were both saying that it's probably the best Italian food we've ever had, and we've both had our share of Italian food in our lives, and I, myself, at some of the best Italian restaurants in New York City. Alla Famiglia was superior to them.   I've only visited Pitt twice, but in my final visit, we will be sure to come back to Alla Famiglia. We promised you will NOT be disappointed.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Thursday with my fiance and 4 other dining companions for dinner.  Alla Famiglia has been on my list of places to try for quite a long time and I was eagerly anticipating eating a dinner here.  We arrived shortly before our reservation time of 7:30 at about the same time as another couple from our party. We were almost immediately taken back to our table which was on the first floor in a back room.  I honestly didn't notice too much while we were walking back to our table but thought there was not much decoration in the room we were in.  Yes there was a fireplace but nothing else really sticks out besides the fact that the lights would dim a bit for about 5 seconds before eventually brightening back up every 10 minutes or so.  Since none of our party had ever been to Alla Famiglia before our server took the time to go over the menu with us.  Whenever he got to the veal chop and explained it was their specialty, I immediately knew that was what I wanted.  So I ended up ordering that with the pizzaiolo option while my fiance went with the seafood diavolo.  My veal chop was described as a double cut natural chop braised with hot and sweet peppers, homemade Italian sausage, and plum tomatoes while my fiances seafood diavola had many different types of seafood in it including a lobster tail.  All entrees also come with a first course of salad and a second course of pasta with vodka sauce, both served family style.  While we were waiting for our first course to come out they served us some crusty Italian bread along with a couple of different dipping sauces of which I remember one that had a couple of different imported cheeses, one with goat cheese and then another which was olive oil based and called the holy oil(?) due to a trio of herbs of which one was basil.  That one was my favorite and when combined with some of the Parmesan cheese that they had on the table was awesome.  After a short while our salads came out, 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us along with a dish of Gorgonzola so that we could top our salads with it.  The salad ended up tasting decent, I only wish that I had more of it.  The six of us quickly finished it all and then were in for quite a bit of a wait before our pasta with vodka sauce arrived.  It was long enough for all of us to notice and wonder what was taking so long for pasta.  Whenever it arrived, once again 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us, I thought that it tasted pretty good.  It wasn't the best vodka sauce I have ever tasted but since I was still pretty hungry at this point I really enjoyed it especially after adding some of the chili oil that they brought to the table with it.  The chili oil gave the sauce that perfect bite for me.  Almost immediately after finishing our pasta our dinner entrees arrived.  My veal chop looked impressive and was big enough to make comments about how it could tip the car on the Flintstones.  Most of that was due to the size of the bone although there was a decent amount of meat on it.  The veal itself was cooked perfectly as it was moist and juicy and I  ended up enjoying it. The pizzaiolo sauce was just ok though as some of the sausage that I had seemed to be burnt while others were fine.  Whenever I had the non burnt pieces I liked it but the couple of burnt pieces really made the sauce inconsistent from bite to bite.  I was also lucky enough to try some of my wonderful fiances lobster tail and thought that it was very good.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender and tasty while not being overdone at all.  After all that we had eaten our whole table ended up passing on dessert and I left the restaurant full but not overly so.  I am still wondering about all of these reviews that tell you how much food they received which was also said by the valet on the way in.  It made me wonder do they normally serve a family style portion to two people instead of the three like they did at our table?  Should I feel cheated on this one?  Maybe I will find out on a future visit but then again maybe I will not.  The bottom line for me is that I might come back here again in the future but I don't think that this would be my first choice.  Don't get me wrong, the food here was pretty good but whenever my food bill after tip is coming out to about $150, they had better either have impeccable service like the Capital Grille or Ruth Chris' or to die for food.  Sadly Alla Famiglia let me down on both accounts here as the food was good and the service average.",

    "text": "Expensive?  Yes.  Worth the price of admission?  Every penny.  My wife and I dined at Alla Famiglia last night, and we were both blown away.  It was our first time here so we went with our waiter's suggestions from start to finish.  After snacking on the ridiculously delicious 'Holy Oil', we started with a couple apps -  Greens and Beans, and the Meatball; both were incredible.  Braised endive, house sausage, and tender white beans seasoned to perfection, and a meatball the size of your fist.  Before our entrees came out, we were each brought a salad and pasta course.  The fresh pasta was served with the best vodka sauce I have ever had -   amazing.  On to the entrees;  I got the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo and my wife got the Coteletta Del Monzu.  Spectacular.   Both the veal chop and the cutlet melted in our mouths.  All in all, after a couple apps, two entrees, a bottle of wine and a couple cocktails, we got out for about $260 after tip.  That said, I've eaten at some amazing restaurants in my time, and I can say with confidence that last night's dinner is easily one of the top 5 meals I've had in my lifetime.  I can't wait to find an excuse to go back.  Well done, Alla Famiglia.  Update:  Visits 2 and 3 to Alla Famiglia were just as spectacular as the first.  My wife and I have ordered something different each time we've visited, and normally I'd say something like 'we haven't been disappointed'.  However, that would be an egregious understatement.  Every visit to this wonderful restaurant has been nothing short of  astonishing.  The food is truly breathtaking, and the service is top notch.  In my humble opinion, this is without question the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Update 2:  As you can see by the number of check-ins I have here, we find every excuse we can to continue to come here.  It is still the best restaurant in the 'Burgh.",

    "text": "I do not say this with many 2 star ratings but I would like to go back for another try.  The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was \"free\" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don't notice.  I also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn't hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).  The food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.  No one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues.  When most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone else's entree was 90% eaten, not even a \"was everything okay\".  Just clear me out and get on with the next one.  I hope to have the opportunity to go back and I will not be seated in the third floor bar area and I will not get my same waitress and give it another try.  I expected so much more.",

I went and drank the blood orange caprahina and it was definitely worth $9. Not only was it delish, but it came in a decently-sized glass too. I also had it with their mozzarella appetizer.

The kitchen is on the first floor when you walk in.  They bring out a warm loaf of bread and several accompaniments-- oil-- cheese-- chick peas and olives... Deeeelish! There is no rush, think of it as a dining experience-- so don't go if you are in a hurry--- you want to enjoy every part. Also-- go hungry.  Every review said to get the meatball app so I thought I had to try it too!!! I will say-- get the meatball app! It is delicious. After your appetizer arrives, they will bring out salad family style and it is not your average salad.  There are walnuts and olives on a bed of mixed greens. It was wonderful.  Then comes the pasta with vodka sauce (everyone gets some!!!) which was incredible. Save most of it for your lunch tomorrow because your entree will be fantastic!!! I had the swordfish which was covered in lump crab meat. Sooooo good!!!  I was too full for dessert.  I will definitely be back. It is a great place for a celebration or when you want a meal to savor. The owner walked around and talked to tables and even brought out our meals.  Our dinner for two was around $150 and we had cocktails. This place is worth the splurge.",

    "text": "Wow.   Some of the best Italian food I have had in my life. Everything feels authentic, straight from Italy, and family owned.   Where to begin? Well the appetizer selection is incredible, my favorite being the provolone fried in truffle oil. The stuffed banana peppers were to die for, and I have had many others that were spectacular.  For the entree, I have had both the veal chop and the filet. The veal chop is almost as large as my arm (not joking) and was delicious, prepared either of their two signature ways. For the filet, I do not like gorgonzola so I asked them to prepare it a different way (which they are very willing to do and usually announce to the table at the beginning of the meal). It was done is a mushroom sauce that was a perfect compliment to the perfectly cooked filet.  Finally, do not forget to save room for dessert (which will be fairly difficult considering the sheer volume of food that they give you). The tiramisu is amazing, and I would highly recommend trying their gelato.   In short, my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I would highly recommend a visit, especially with a large group. Reservations help, but not usually required.",

I was too full to eat the main course, but I enjoyed it the next day.  My boyfriend made the reservation for us and told them it was my birthday--they printed out a special menu just for me!

    "text": "After a friend told me about her wonderful experience here, I knew I had to go. I also knew that it wasn't really in my budget. Well, lucky for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit. I sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw Alla Famiglia he said, \"Oh honey. Make the reservation - I've got it.\"  YES! I knew I kept him around for some reason!  So on a cold, snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.  First off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.  The Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had.  Onto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy.  Salad course: Great salad!  Pasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel...  For the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much.  I could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though.   I really cannot wait to go again.",

Chef Jonathan is a genius - his \"Veal Chop Milanese\" with lump crab, toasted pine nuts, and lemon is the BEST I've ever had.  Every time we eat here, my husband orders this dish and refuses to try anything else - that's how AMAZING it is.    I have tried a variety of entrees - everything from the the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo to the Steak il pizzaiolo to the Medallions of veal Pomodoro ai Pepperoni.  Each dish is infused with deliciousness that makes these entrees OUT OF THIS WORLD!    You have got to try the following:  mozzarella (apptz), hot peppers (apptz), mozzarella stuffed meatball (apptz), vodka pasta (automatically received with your meal - sauce is delicious), veal chop milanese (entree).    You won't be disappointed - the kitchen is open so you can even watch as Chef Jonathan prepares your dinner.    Make a reservation.  Neighborhood is a bit sketchy so be careful.    PS.  I've taken all my friends, family, and business partners (many who do not live in Pittsburgh) here and everyone absolutely loves it and wishes they lived in Pitt so they could come here more often.  In fact, we no longer live in Pittsburgh, but every time we come into town for a visit, we HAVE to eat dinner at our favorite Alla Famiglia!",

They are planning an expansion to increase table space.  Jonathan knows the business and is the best in town.  The veal chop is the signature dish with several preparations.  Every dinner is complimented with salad and vodka pasta that is a meal in and of itself.  The meatball appetizer cannot be skipped.  It is stuffed with mozzarella and topped with Parmesan cheese.  Jonathan also has the restaurant, Arlecchino, in Washington County which is a smaller version of Alla Famiglia and still very good!",

    "text": "Gotta say....worth the effort to find this gem of a restaurant off the beaten path. First, the waitstaff at this place are incredible. They take everything in stride. Things start with fresh bread, a small dish of olives and the Holy oil....better love garlic!  Appetizer....a tasty softball-sized meatball with mozzarella in a nicely spiced red sauce. Not your average hamburger meatball...this is a work of art...perfectly seasoned, juicy and delicious.  Salad....wow! Crisp greens, olives, peppers, Gorgonzola with a red wine based vinaigrette...couldn't stop eating it.  Pasta course....opted for both house pastas....the first was the oft mentioned linguine tossed in the wheel of Romano with cream and black pepper. Served table side with a bottle of deliciously spicy oil. Second was the curly pasta tossed in the signature vodka sauce! The pasta was spot on cooked...not a soggy noodle in sight. The preparations were executed to perfection.  Entrees...veal Milanese...this is a beautiful double chop, \"paddled\" into tenderness, dredged in house made bread crumbs, tossed with pine nuts and cooked to perfection. If you can only order one thing here...this is it! We also had the filet of beef in Gorgonzola cream...medium rare, tender, well seasoned...rich, decadent and incredible.  Dessert....yes...we forced ourselves...homemade cannoli and a variant of tiramisu with toasted/burnt almond slivers and raspberries. Tiramisu was delectable...light, balanced and very flavorful.  Haven't really added much to the raves from previous patrons...just had to chime in our hearty AMEN of agreement. Love everything about this place. Thank you Jonathan...and all of your staff for an awesome dining experience.",

    "text": "If I'm ever in a situation to pick my last meal on earth, it wouild be from Alla Famiglia.    My husband took me here for my birthday celebration.  We were treated extremely well from the second we walked in the door.  They even had a menu printed with a \"Happy birthday Jennifer\" message on the top!  What a nice touch.  We were seated in the area near the door with a view of the kitchen.  There is also a small room (three tables) on the same floor.  The upper floor has a dining area and bar, but they are often booked for private events.  When you arrive, there are three accompaniments for your fresh baked bread.  The \"holy oil\" that is an olive oil and banana pepper mix.  It lives up to its name because it was divine.  There was also a goat cheese spread that had red peppers and olives.  I'm a huge goat cheese fan, so I could have eaten this by the spoonful.  There was also a bean and cheese mixture with three types of cheese chopped up.  It was incredible as well.  You may be tempted to fill up on these delictible delights, but don't, becase as good as these items are, it only gets better from there.  We were having a hard time deciding whether to get the meatball appetizer or the hand pulled mozzarella.  The waitress steered us towards their meatball since it is one of their signature items.  It was a wise decision.  The meatball is the size of a fist and it was perfect.  I don't usually like meatballs or red sauce and I found myself devouring every last bit of both on this plate.  The meatball is stuffed and topped with an excellent mozzarella and then drenched with an amazing red sauce with bits of garlic.  If you order this, make sure you are sharing because it is huge.   The salad course was very tasty.  It as a mix of field greens, an olive oil dressing, gorgonzola and other incredibly tasty things.  I could have eaten the entire plate of it myself but wanted to save room for the pasta and my entree.  The pasta course is a house made spiral pasta in a vodka sauce.  It was extremely tasty.  So much so that my husband said he would have been happy if that alone had been his main course.  It had such incredible fresh taste.    For our main courses, I got the veal chop prepared in the milanese style.  It was HUGE, pretty much the size of the plate.  A nice surprise considering how small portions tend to be at other fancy restaurants in the area.  It was served with a lemon butter sauce and had large chunks of crab on top.  It was tender and you could cut it with a fork.  I savored every bite (and have leftovers to enjoy at home).  My husband had the filet and loved his choice as well.  A lot of flavors and extremely tender.  It was served with a leek cream and I would love to know how they make it because I have leeks at home that I need to use for something.  I swore I didn't have room left for even a single bite more, but when I learned that pumpkin gelato was the dessert, I had to try it.  It was so smooth, sweet and reminded me of the amazing gelato I had when I was in Italy.  A house made limoncello completed my incredibly amazing meal.  Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth it!  I don't know when we'll be back simply because of how expensive it is, but I do know we'll be back.",

    "text": "The hype is real. My husband and I had a date night at Alla Familiga and thoroughly enjoyed everything they had to offer. The menu changes, so you are handed a menu with the date printed on it when you are seated. The meal is meant to be progressive , so slow down and enjoy the experience! We started with some warm ciabatta bed accompanied by various spreads along with the famous mozzarella stuffed meatball appetizer. This meatball will serve two and is stuffed with mozzarella and dripping with house made sauce. The other appetizer we thought about ordering was the smoked provolone, which we will most definitely order next time! Next up is the house salad dressed with a vinegarette that is the perfect balance between sweet and tangy. After this follows a pasta course, cavatappi with vodka creme sauce (delicious!). Then it's finally time for your entree. I had the Ribeye Diane and my husband ordered the Seafood Diavolo. These were cooked to perfection and my husband, a self proclaimed seafood connoisseur, couldn't pay this dish enough compliments. I only ate half my steak, which the waiter was more than happy to box up for me, in hopes of some room for dessert. This was the literal cherry on top - their tiramisu is the BEST, and I mean the absolute BEST I've ever had. Instead of coffee or espresso like the standard recipe calls for, they use marscapone, Chambord and raspberries topped with a burnt almond crust. Every bite was a revelation, and desserts are my area of expertise. I'm in love and I don't care who knows it!  Alla Familigia has it all - atmosphere, great service and fantastic food. It's not cheap (about $160 for my husband and I to dine, he had two coronas and I drank Coke) but it is well worth the splurge for a memorable date night.",

    "text": "Our experience last night at Alla Famiglia for Alicia's, my fiance's birthday, has changed my view of restaurants, food, service and ambiance in this region.  Staff helped with putting coats, hats and scarfs onto hangers ... just a thing they do without creating an expectation for tipping.    As a side note I've lived in Chicago, Memphis, Tokyo, New York area, Greece, Thailand, Vietnam ... did not just fall of the turnip truck yesterday re dinning.  Note -- you can come casual in jeans or suit and tie -- this is about a food experience, not any the other immaterial issues.   We made our reservation late (or actually Alicia's daughter made them!)  but on being given the menu after being seated, found that it was customized for Alicia's birthday!  Apparently they print the menu anew every day.  Being a bit artsy, I am having this framed at Michael's to give to her daughter as a marker note in family history.   Lisa was our server and explained that they could thus customize the menu for special occasions. What a nice touch. The place is so New York or Chicago, and so stunningly professional!  So when you call, make sure you tell them if there is a special occasion.  A customized menu is a nice humanizing touch.  Lisa had been working there for 4 months -- perfect experience shaping in every way.  Kudos to all concerned.  The manager was helping with everything and being involved in the processes that make for a memorable dining experience.  Front of the house to the back of the house -- all interactions were great.  He came by to same hello, introduce himself, and be available.  Answered several questions on throughout the evening.  Impressive actually.  The \"Holy Oil\" olive oil and bread ... excellent.  We sat in the downstairs \"kitchen\" area which I liked as you become involved in the larger food presentation issues.  The staff interacted with each other as in a ballet -- space is tight, older building, interesting art works on the wall.  As an anthropologist I follow the interaction of the staff closely and was impressed with the smooth clarity of the ballet.  For people of my ilk, this was fun.  Other reviewers will comment more on food, food selections and preparation.  We brought two bottles of wine (allowed....), and it was presented beautifully. Water to the table routinely.  Questions answered instantly.  It seemed most other guests left with \"excess food bags!\"  The boxes were handled by the staff automatically and without question.  In our case they anticipated the request... whew.  Rarely happens.  Valet parking.  Just do it.  Drive to the front of the place and into the side lot.  Valet parking is free but please give the attendant a generous tip.  He/she, given the winter conditions, had to sit outside by a heater to make one's entry/exit pleasurable.  While leaving and waiting for our automobile to come around we spoke with a family of 4 who come to Alla Famiglia regularly. They had similar experiences every time.    This is not one of the snobby \"foody\" places.  The management has created a family meal preparation ambience that is unique in my experience.  Hints:  call a week ahead, get a table near the downstairs kitchen area (side left back to the wall -- that is what we will do from now on).  There are other places further in the back where it is quieter, and upstairs, but the meal is about how it is created and that position is perfect.  Appreciate the clatter and noise!  This is a place to experience the ballet.  Expect the bill to be more than other places.  Expect the food the be far better than other places.  Expect the experience to be one of the best in the region.  Expect the service to be the best ever.  As an add-on note, we reformed the filet today and it was still wonderful.     \"Jen C.\" in yelp said this is the \"best homemade meal you will ever receive from a restaurant.\"  We agree.    This is going to be our routine \"go to\" place for family and close friends.  Read the other reviews for confirmation of this one.  Go early with friends, go hungry, set aside some real time with the people you want to be with.  Relax into a nice life experience.  The management and staff have created a truly unique moment for diners.  ((And no.. I am not related to them....)).    Roy and Alicia",

Food has degraded in quality, policies have changed and the hospitality is now completely gone.  If you want a good Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh, visit Joseph Tambellini in Highland Park instead.  We normally frequent there (Joseph Tambellini) but saved Alla Familiglia for special occasions.  Never again.  Our mistake - Alla Famiglia = mediocre food,  high prices and intolerable owner.

We had their famous softball-sized meatball (it's actually that big) and the smoked provolone to start and both were out of this world!! I highly recommend the smoked provolone, it was life changing. For our entrees, my husband had the filet Gorgonzola and I had the NY strip. The NY strip was hands down the best steak I have ever had, cooked to perfection (medium rare). My husband raved about his filet as well. We had the tiramisu for dessert after our waitress raved about it and it was amazing, not like any tiramisu I've ever had. We finished our night with complimentary glasses of champagne for our anniversary, such a treat! This will definitely be our go-to \"special occasion\" place!

Table side dinner was butchered with adding about 4 ounces of truffle oil to the dish, it's all I tasted. My girlfriends dinner was way too salty. The dishes were taken back, they re tossed my girlfriends half eaten seafood with the new pasta. Very tacky. At no time during our experience did a manager stop over to check on us. The server was very nice and did everything she could to help. Will not be going back, highly over rated.",

Very generous portions of seafood...large shrimp, lobster tail, large scallops, jumbo lump crabmeat, mussels, and clam meat all in a perfect red sauce.  The veal cutlets and greens and beans were also phenomenal.  The dinner starts off with bread, olive oil, goat cheese spread, chickpea & cheese bread topper.  Salad & Pasta served family style...all great!!!  The atmosphere is of the restaurant is perfect.  Will definitely be back.",

This quaint little gem doesn't look like much on the outside, but the inside is PACKED with the flavors of some amazing Italian dishes!  Not only that, the menu we were given was a \"keepsake\" from the restaurant with a \"Congratulations Aaron & Caitie!\" at the top of the menu! A very nice to touch for a special occasion!  The food here was such a beautiful mix of a homemade style with fresh ingredients and artistic cooking!  If you are looking for an appetizer, would definitely recommend sharing the Meatball.  The meat for it was so tender with a nice sprinkle of cheese throughout.  The salad was amazing and unlike any salad I've ever had.  In it the bitter olives were opposed by a light red wine vinaigrette dressing.  The pasta with vodka sauce was not foreign to me, but the chili infused olive oil that it was topped with made it like none that I've tried before!  For the main dishes, my wife ordered bacon wrapped elk and I had the veal.  Neither of us could finish our meals...  Needless to say we were absolutely stuffed when leaving.  This was an extremely cool dining experience for a very special occasion! I wish I could afford to come here more often.  Would highly recommend this place if you are looking for some fine dining, a romantic evening, or just something absolutely different than anywhere else!",

I went here for my birthday and absolutely loved everything we got, even though by the time the main course came I was stuffed from the bread, giant meatball, and pasta course (it was still great when I reheated it at home).   The waitress we had was very helpful when helping us sort out the menu. She lead us to the giant stuffed meatball which seems to be a favorite of everyone's on yelp!   All and all, I would definitely recommend this homey dinner location for a special event as it's rather pricey. However, the meal you get is worth the money when you think about both quantity and quality.",

    "text": "Consistent with the rest of my Pittsburgh culinary experience, this place disappoints. Expensively so.   The good: the wait staff and bartender were wonderful. While their complaining about management was certainly unprofessional, as a solo diner I appreciated the entertainment. The drinks--one cocktail, one red, one white, were tasty abd reasonably priced. The bread and \"bread sides\" were also enjoyable.   The bad: the house salad was more soup that salad. Drenched in a syrupy sweet dressing, accentuated with the odd choice of green and kalamata olives, I had to prop my bowl up to drain the puddle of sugary mixture. Nix the olives and lighten the dressing and you have a pretty good salad, generous with extras. The lobster ravioli was so bland even the copious serving of butter was rendered tasteless. I'll give credit that the ravilio appeared made in house and was cooked to an appropriate al dente. Lobster? I tasted none. The only perceptible  flavor was charred ramps which was not unpleasant.   Perhaps the err in my ways was venturing away from the veal, which in all fairness comes highly recommended. I try to limit meat... Apparently a bad idea here. Wanted to try the tiramisu but just couldn't risk it. $96 for disappointment. The patio, with a nice view of an industrial size dumpster, is coated with the film of weeks of neglect. Probably a fine place for a cocktail.",

    "text": "I just ate at this fine establishment last night and overall I really enjoyed my experience. If you're looking for a special night out with friends or family, then look no further. This is just the place.   We started the evening with some cocktails. Beware... the bar is extremely small (as in four seats) and I wasn't too impressed with their drinks. Although they had all the ingredients necessary for a high quality cocktail, they all seemed to fall flat. We had multiple drinks and all of them seemed too sweet and lazy, no real expertise on the appropriate way to make a decent mixed drink. Next time we will have drinks beforehand somewhere else.   Once seated, the real fun began. The waiting staff was helpful and very accommodating. We decided to go with a few appetizers. Since my True love is charcuterie and cheese I was intrigued with the Allegheny smoked provolone. It was a small portion, but for what it lacked in size, it made up for in flavor. This was delicious. The smokiness of the cheese with the crunch of the arugula was exactly what I had hoped for. A lot of reviewers recommended the meatball, but I've always had a thing for Italian stuffed hot peppers, so we ordered those instead. They were flavorful and a little dry...but still very enjoyable. Not too much heat.  Our second course was fresh bread and salad accompanied by dipping oil. The house salad was definitely not an afterthought. The red wine vinaigrette, raisins and gorgonzola made this salad a highlight for the evening. It's rare that a house salad goes remembered...this one deserved some recognition.   Our next course was a homemade Cavatappi pasta in a vodka tomato sauce. This pasta was a stark reminder that majority of the time when I make pasta at home...i'm doing it wrong. The pasta was cooked to perfection. Not only that, the simplicity of the ingredients in the sauce just made the entire bite sing. It just all worked so beautifully. They also included a bottle of chili-pepper infused olive oil to drizzle over the top of the pasta to give it just a little extra kick. This took the dish to a whole new level. I could have easily had this as my main course and I would have been delighted. Seriously, a home run.   Finally, for my main course I chose the house specialty, The Veal Chop Milanese. The cut of meat was barbaric in a good way. Huge in size and tender, this cut had it all. The rib chop was served with jumbo lump crab meat on top which I thought was a bit over board and unnecessary.   All in all, I was very pleased with my experience. The intimate feel coupled with the quality and care put into the food made this a favorite. The food is rustic and flavorful. You can't go wrong with this place.",

It amazes me how so many people complain about the cost of the meal to dine here. You know the saying in life; you only get what you pay for? Well you can't expect to go here hoping to pay $100 for 2 people. If that's your budget, then just don't go. Why go and complain about it? It's obvious by reading the reviews that it is one of the most expensive in town. So you know this going into dinner. You will not find any food of higher quality than this place.  We have traveled around the world and this is my favorite in this country. It is just lucky for us that we live here and can go whenever we want to. We have been all over Europe, Singapore, Bora Bora, South Africa, The Maldives, Dubai, Malyasia, and several other countries but this place is tops. Believe me!!  We went last night to the new addition at Alla Famiglia. It is beautiful. What a great design & interior. It's very classic and beautiful. Their cocktails were great. The Old Fashioned with a big rock was classic and was one of the best I've had. The food was spectacular as usual. You know you will never leave hungry. The service was spot on. Congratulations to Jonathan & Brandy Vlasic on another success story on the restaurant scene in Pittsburgh. Please go now before the reservations will be difficult to attain. I highly recommend it.",

Unfortunately I hadn't gone in a while and when I recently went I honestly thought I went through the wrong door.  They apparently added on and turned the new section into a fancy trendy feel.  I was so disappointed.  They took a masterpiece, and just in my opinion, ruined it.  It now has the same look and feel as all new modern steakhouses.  It would be better for for NYC than Pittsburgh.  I really am distraught how they could just do a 180 turn to the look and feel.  No longer cozy.  No more charm.  I hope they are doing well and I'm sure they are, but this place is no longer for me.  Sad to see it go.",

I recommend sharing it if you are getting a main course because every main course comes with pasta and a salad. So, if don't want to be stuffed before the main course, share the meatball. -I got the Tagliatelle seafood dish and it was impeccable. If you like pasta and seafood I recommend ordering this. The lobster, clams, and scallops tasted very fresh for a Pittsburgh restaurant. -The service was great. Our waiter was very informed regarding the menu and wine pairing.",

    "text": "Good food, generous portions, pleasant service and delectable dessert. If you have the dough to spare for a pricey dinner, this is a fine place to try in the Pittsburgh area.  The extra salad is a great mix of flavours, if a little oily - I really enjoyed the sugared walnuts in particular.  The extra pasta was generally decent - the noodle itself was pretty good, if a little bit soft, but the sauce wasn't particularly memorable. Maybe pack this one and save space for entree and dessert first.  Where the meatball appetizer was doused in sauce and had a strong flavour, the veal had a more understated appeal. If you enjoy your steak medium rare, to savour the rawer, umami quality of fresh meat, this dish will serve it up. The texture of the veal itself does a lot of work in making this a great dish - I wish there was just a little more spice and flavour to accompany the great material.  Dessert was quite fantastic - even after stuffing myself with meal after meal, I was enthusiastic in finishing the cheesecake. It might even be one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had, it's certainly up there on the list.  We had to take leftovers of just about everything that was served, which should give you an idea of the amount of food you'll be plied with.  One final note about the service - the valet was kind enough to keep an eye out for our ride in the dismal weather. I didn't realize my phone lost connection while waiting for our ride, and if not for the valet, we might have missed it.  If possible, try to get a seat in a fancier location. We got to sit ourselves by the window while it stormed outside, which was nice enough, but you might enjoy more space in a private setting to work on the massive feast.",

My brother is from out of town as well. The valet driver who is a foreigner and spoke with an accent yelled at us for parking in a city parking lot saying he was parking there and started screaming telling my brother \"fuck you move your car or I'm having it towed\" we said no and continued to walk in to the store to purchase tea, before we could take two steps he had grabbed my brother up and assaulted him. My brother told him not to lay his fucking hand on him and we continue into the store. The valet driver followed us into the store screaming and cussing. This parking lot has city signs posted and has a paying booth and he kept arguing that it wasn't. While all this was happening the valet driver left the expensive car he was moving stopping with the keys in it running in the middle of the alley way while he was harassing us. He left the store and parked the car next to my brothers car and waited for us to come back out. When we came out he started yelling at us and threatening us. He told me \"don't get in that fucking car\" and I told him \"this is a free country. You're not going to tell me I can't get in my car\" then he started yelling at my brother saying fuck you and other ignorant slurs and then he said \"I'll fucking shoot you!\" He continued to call me a bitch and a whore as I was defending my brother because you can't just threaten to shoot someone. He continued to yell ignorant things at us as we pulled out and left. We weren't even in the store for 5 minutes and had to deal with our lives being threatened and harassed all over the restaurants valet claims the city parking lot when they have a lot that takes up an entire block behind the restaurant. This valet driver should not be working around people if he can not control how he act and if he wants to put his hands on people and threaten people's lives. I will never eat at this restaurant after the way they treat people that are from this neighborhood.",

As you know truffle oil goes a long way, it was way too much truffle. My dish was a fra Diablo pasta. It tasted like pure salt. We mentioned it to the server, she got us both new dishes but no manager came over to check on us. I could tell they used the same seafood, the dish was still extremely salty. At that point I was over it and just ate it. Then dessert we ordered a dessert for here and one togo.

Temperance is a virtue.  Don't be like me and commit a sin against your entree by eating it when you are STUFFED, and can't fully enjoy it. because like a fool you couldn't restrain yourself with the bread bc carbs turn you into AN ANIMAL and you didn't pace yourself.  You'll get all the bread you can handle.  Our waiter John, who was super nice and attentive, suggested we order the meatball appetizer and he was right.  Its huge, its literally the size of a softball and comes out wrapped in cheese, in a heavenly marinara sauce, served with love.  It was extremely good.    Then you get the salad course, which comes in a home made vinagrette which is also delicious.    Then comes the pasta course,  We had fusilli pasta in vodka sauce which was very good but at this point I was basically full and tapping out.  I ended up eating not even 1/4 of my pasta, but then the waiter offered to bag it up for me, so I had lunch for the next day.  Your entree comes out after the pasta course, and you're going to be already stuffed at this point.   Now, I took my friend here for his birthday.  I think they key is to come here when you are not paying, bc my bank account was crying when I saw the entrees start at $40.  More on that in a moment.  I ordered the filet and it was SPECTACULAR.  I mean, amazing.  So good I did not share, and after I ate it, I fondly reflected on the time my filet and I spent together.  Temporarily in my mouth, forever in my heart.  Or on my hips.  It was not diet food, it was covered in some sort of heavenly cream cheese sauce that is the stuff dreams are made of.  It was a $60 dinner and it tasted like one too.    My friend ordered the blackened sea bass and it came out looking like a work of art.  Both our dishes were basically food porn.  He loved his dinner too and said that his fish came out topped with large chunks of crab and he loved it.  We were waayyy too full to even think about dessert.  I'm sure the desserts would have been divine but we just could not do it.  In fact I ended up taking half my filet home with me.  This place is technically expensive, but if you think about it, it's really not that bad.  Our bill came to $200 for the two of us, but for what you get, it's really a pretty damn good deal.  You get top notch service, the restaurant itself is beautiful, and the food is absolutely incredible.  This was probably the best meal I have had in Pittsburgh.  Oh--and you get enough food that you get a full meal the next day.   I cannot believe that I had not been here before, and I will absolutely be back.",

There was a gas leak and they were being forced to close early. Thier solution was to cook everything and bring it out to the table at one time.  Ugh!!!! A 5 course meal in an hour and 15 minutes.  If I'm spending $150 for a meal for 2 I'd like it to not have all the courses at once.  Next, (and this is unbelievable) we were on the second floor and at the bar 5 feet away was A PAIR OF HOOKERS. LOL!!!! How do I know they were prostitutes? Well between drunkenly and loudly dropping the \"F\" bomb they would drunkenly and loudly discuss business. When we asked if they should be shut off we were told there was little that could be done BECAUSE THEY WERE REGULARS. I swear I'm not making this up... I should post in tips \"When making reservations ask to be seated in a room different from the prostitutes.\"  I will say the service was a 5 star quality and the food was good. To be honest I'm not sure if I'll go back or recommend to others like it was recommended to me. Based on all the other reviews I'm guessing it was just a off night....",

    "text": "My grandmother, a woman from Italy who expresses little emotion, commented \"they have good food there\" after we left--the ultimate sign of approval.  I called the restaurant on the day of, and while they clearly were pretty booked, the hostess graciously fit our party in (for a party of 5 they plan to allocate 2.5 hrs). There was unexpected traffic on our way in, so called to give a heads up, and whoever picked up was very forgiving and even tried to help us find a better route.  Though we arrived a few minutes late for the reservation, this was not made to be a big deal and we were seated immediately.   The atmosphere is as if you are having dinner in your Italian grandmothers house (I know this because I have an Italian grandmother), very warm and cozy and decorations that can stimulate a conversation.  They have a nice selection of cocktails, and of course wine, but it is definitely a place you go for the food.   Our waiter told us they currently get their bread from mancinis, but made it sound as though they will be going back to making their own rather soon.  The bread is offered with multiple options for spreading/dipping including an olive oil based dip and a goat cheese spread, which was my favorite.  For appetizers, we tried the meatball--which comes out as one giant meatball but was more than enough as an appetizer for 5--and the fried cheese. Both were delicious, and my brother even took the extra red sauce home.   The main courses did not disappoint either.  With each entree you get a \"side\" salad--which was good enough to be a meal itself--and some of their clearly homemade pasta.  I'm not sure if they always serve the sides the same way, but he pasta came in a vodka sauce that was just the right amounts of creamy and spicy, and they offer an oil you can add individually if you are one that likes extra spice.  I had the cotoletta del monzu (forgive my spelling) or breaded veal cutlets AND crabmeat, so juicy and flavorful.  My brother (who I didn't think ate seafood) had a seafood diavlo dish and loved it.  The only complaint was that the \"spicy oil\" was still not spicy enough, but I doubt this would be of concern to anyone besides my mother.     In summary, I am a person who generally doesn't like to go to Italian restaurants--I don't really like pasta and I've had so much Italian food in my life--but if you live in or are even just visiting Pittsburgh, alla famiglia is a must!",

The sauce was just delicious.  Then I had the Veal chop malaise style as its there signature dish.  Huge portion.  My date had the filet and she loved it. Comes with a side of pasta (which was the most disappointing part of dinner but still very good) and a side salad which was excellent.  We were so stuffed but I got dessert To Go as I was taking my date out for her bday.  Got the tiramisu with raspberry filling (both things I would never pick but it was her bday) and boy was I in for a surprise.  Probably one of the best desserts I've ever had.  It was absolutely the highlight of the experience.  It is pricey and they do allow you to bring in a bottle of wine for a $20 corkage fee but it sure beat paying the cheapest bottle price of $58.  I do recommend the place as you will not leave hungry at all.",

My honey had some kind of Diablo sauce with meat and homemade pasta. Loved it!! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I was so looking forward to some good Italian tiramisu. What's more Italian than that. Well they threw me for a loop when they said theirs is raspberry/almond tiramisu. So I ordered it anyways. Unfortunately, we didn't like it. The Cannoli was also not good. I am an excellent baker so I guess I have a discriminating palette.  But still a great place especially for a special day!!",

We also had two desserts: the banana n coconut pie and the tiramisu! Both desserts are served w cream and taste fantastic! The pie has a very banana-ish texture with pieces of coconuts in it. And the house special tiramisu is made from raspberries and almonds instead of espresso or coffee.

If you're a big meat eater, or love to eat huge amounts of pasta, ok, this is great. But the sauces were just ok, nothing spectacular. Spaghetti with clams was covered with red pepper flakes but not noted as such on the menu. Would you like someone to cover your pizza slice with red pepper flakes without asking?

However, I don't know that the food was so good that it justified the high price point. This place is expensive and reserved for special occasions, which I knew coming in, but I wasn't really that blown away by my meal. You do get A LOT of food, but walking away with $300+ bill for a group of 4 just seems over the top when you consider the fact you're eating mostly pasta.",

Our server was Robert, probably one of the best server I have ever had. He was so gracious and knowledgeable. The chef came over to our table twice, first to tell us that everything is made to order, so if there was something we wanted changed, they were happy to prepare anything to our desires. He returned to ask if everything was good. \"One of the best meals I have ever eaten\", was how the different meals were described. Simply incredible.",

    "text": "Let's just start with the elephant in the room...picture a vintage Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing his biceps in the mirror. This is the framed \"art\" inside the women's restroom located on the 2nd floor. Odd. I nearly poked my eyes out with my mascara brush from staring. It's hypnotizing.  Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about  the restaurant!  After months of whining, a group of 8 of us finally decided to nut up or shut up and finally made plans. (Thank you, Samantha B. for organizing!)  Getting a reservation for 8 is not an easy task. The building is a three-story, traditional townhouse  that is very narrow leaving only so much space inside for the dining area, bar, and the kitchen. And, it is located in the middle of Allentown. Yes, Allentown. This fact could qualify as the baby elephant in the room but it seems to be the trend to operate fantastic restaurants in areas that would make your average xenophobe from suburbia go bat shit cray cray.  And, for the record, I'm not drinking Hatorade. I was equally \"scurred\"  during the drive up E. Warrington Avenue...and I live in the East End where hipsters and old school hippies are known to reside and give peace a chance.   The reality is what it is. It's a scary part of town but it did not matter a damn when we got out of the car. It was a Saturday night and we were greeted by an average Joe  valet who sincerely welcomed us to the restaurant  and told us to enjoy our dinner. The locals who walked by smiled and nodded as if they were giving us their approval. It's as if the restaurant was under a dome, protected by a force field that doesn't allow the stereotypical nonsense most would fear when entering Allentown at night.   We were greeted by our server who immediately took our drink orders. I didn't see a bar on the first floor so I almost hesitated to order my usual dirty martini and my sweetheart's Manhattan, thinking they were limited in their mixology. Orders were taken without pause and both drinks were most impressive. Our friends enjoyed vino rossos and biancos from their diverse wine list that is 100% Italia!   Tables are set with \"Holy Oil\" for dipping artisanal Italian breads, a seasoned cheese and cecci bean gustoso, and, my favorite, a fresh goat cheese olive spread.  We started with the artichoke appetizer special and shared the meatball appetizer with the rest of the table. Yes, shared. The meatball is bigger than Barry Bonds and Kanye West's egos combined. And, it was friggin' fantastic. The flavors, the marinara sauce, the mozzarella stuffed inside...If I could marry a meatball, this would be matrimonial bliss.  My sweetheart chose the highly recommended veal chop Milanese. This is yet another piece of meat listed on the menu not small in size. Because I am always the a-hole of the group, I asked if I could have Linguine and Clam sauce instead of the pasta prep on the menu. Again, no hesitation. Wow. But the groans from my our table makes me still an a-hole. I DON'T CARE! IT WAS MY CARB DAY DAMNIT! :-)  Our entrees did not disappoint. TASTY!!!! The entrees minus the pasta came with salad and pasta side served family style. Lots of food to be shared.  We finished with the hand-spun espresso gelato. Others at the table went for other gelato flavors and the Tiramisu. We all had spoons to share. All were \"delish\".  I was tempted to order the other highly recommended entree, the Cowboy Steak Diane. My friend Beth had the pleasure. The wild mushrooms on her dish looked just as big as the meatballs and she raved about the Worcestershire butter. She offered me a sample but I was too full and ready to birth my food baby.  Oh yeah. How could I forget! Franco Harris walked in. SHUT UP!!! Not entirely surprising after viewing the wall on the second floor covered with photos of VIPs posing with the chef/owner.   It's great to see a gem in Allentown that can shine a light on the other diamonds in the ruff in that area. But don't let  the neighborhood fool you. This restaurant is VERY high end in service, cuisine, price, and atmosphere.  I really enjoyed my experience at Alla Familigia so maybe it wasn't such a coincidence they placed The Terminator's Mr. Universe pic in the restroom...because... I'll be back.",

You'll thank me later. 2) The bread and fixins (especially the bean and cheese gustoso), while EXTREMELY yummy, pale in comparison to the rest of the meal.  You want to wait for your meal.  Trust me.  YOU want to wait for the homemade pasta. The smaller portions of veal are PLENTY and so unbelievably tender.  Also the preparation is really well balanced.  I had the Escalopes of veal (lots of mushrooms and spinach) and it felt like the veggies were integral to the dish.  Most places would have skimped . . . not Alla Famiglia.  Really good.  So good that I ate till I looked like I had a food baby in my stomach.  Pretty?  No.  Completely worth it?  Yes.",

We had a very pleasant dining experience and enjoyed our meal and wine recommendation.  Today, however, we were going to enjoy our leftovers, but discovered that our Veal Milanese chop was completely raw and inedible around the bone.  Needless to say, we were upset that we did not discover this while at the restaurant.  The portion that was eaten at the restaurant (the meat not around the bone) was cooked medium rare, so it was dark pink in the center and cooked through on the outside.  As shown in the photo, the meat on the bone appears not to have been cooked at all.  Overall, we were disappointed that this happened, especially considering the price point of this restaurant.  At this point, I can't say that we would recommend Alla Famiglia to our friends.",

    "text": "This review is shouted out to fellow vegetarians,  vegans don't even bother.   This was my second time  visiting this highly acclaimed restaurant and I planned to give it my best effort to not make the staff jump through any hoops to accommodate my requests.   Let's start with the offer for water... I hated to grill the waitress,  but I had to ask if the water she offered was from the spigot or filtered.   She stated that the water came from the same filtering system aa soft drinks. So,  I gave it a shot.   It tasted so chemicalized I couldn't force myself to take a second sip.   Thankfully my companion felt the same way and ordered bottled water.   (my Savior, since I was trying my best not to embarrass anyone at the table)   Then came the menu. It was 98% geared to carnivors.   I was able to find one item,  vermicelli,  but the waitress said the pastas came with vodka sauce,  which I didn't want.   I ended up needing to ask, with dedication to finding something tasty,  for something else.   The last time I was there I settled for the marinara which was in no way special.   Then she mentioned Diavlo sauce,  so I went with that.   The first 2 bites sent me to the ladies room.   I dabbled my way through as much as o could eat, all the while trying to think of who I could give the doggy bag to.   The artichoke appetizer was good and so was the salad.   I'm certain this restaurant is not for me.",

We started with the smoked provolone cheese and literally found ourselves lapping every last drop of this delectable appetizer with bread served at the table among three different dipping spreads, including an olive oil with spicy kick! We then moved on to the veal parmigiana that comes with a side of pasta (we chose penne alla vodka). They are known for their veal and it is no surprise why that may be, with how tasty and tender the meat came out. To wash it all down we got the classic cannoli's and tiramisu - LOVE. I highly recommend this place for a romantic night out, think about it with valentines day approaching!",

    "text": "Sometimes, a restaurant experience is life changing, and that's how I already think of my experience at Alla Famiglia last Friday night. It was the end of a hectic work week for me, and I was so excited to go to dinner to celebrate our good friend's birthday. Unfortunately, my husband came down with a stomach bug and was unable to attend. However, with a nudge from my coworkers, I made the last minute decision to attend solo -- and I'm so glad I did.   I was running a bit late and missed the waitress's entire rundown of the menu but I did get the gist of it. Essentially, everything is customizable. However, our table must not have been very creative because all but one of the girls chose to drink the well-balanced pomegranate martini all night and several of us ordered the same entree as well.   Bread was already sitting out on the table when I arrived surrounded by different tasty toppings. We started with two appetizers -- a large meatball and smoked provolone cheese (I think). The large meatball was tasty but nothing spectacular in my opinion while the cheese was simply delicious.   Penne alla vodka comes standard with the meals but my friend knew to ask the waitress for the (Cacio e Pepe). This simple dish of pasta and cheese was absolutely decadent and mixed in a cheese wheel in front of us. But most importantly, the steak I ordered -- a filet mignon topped with Gorgonzola -- was just to die for. Cooked to a medium rare perfection, it had a well seared exterior and was covered in a lovely sauce and a few other veggies as well.   And then the desserts... all three that the table tried were amazing. I personally ordered the chocolate cake with peanut butter icing and it was incredible. If I made cakes that well, I don't know if I could part with them to sell them in any old restaurant.   And now for the \"cons.\" I'm sad to say there are a few. The restaurant was very tight in places. For example, we had a young couple sitting in the same room as our large (and very boisterous) crew of 8. I think the poor couple felt like they were tagging along for our meal. Our waitress was a bit quirky and I was a bit disappointed by some of her actions, such as lack of helpfulness when we wanted to split the check, etc.   Overall, this meal was a dream and several of us are planning to return soon!",

My wife and I enjoyed our anniversary dinner here tonight. I had the bone-in ribeye with lemon, rosemary, and Romano. She had Halibut and Tiger shrimp Piccata. Both were tremendous. But the real stars for me are the pre-meal fixtures. The salad was hands down the best I've had, ever. You can't fake the time that they're putting into enhancing the highest quality ingredients. Why would you soak golden raisins in Marsala wine? Now I'm asking myself how I've ever eaten a salad without them. Fresh bread with accoutrements that are perfected with attention to detail. Every meal comes with, like INCLUDES, the best Cavatappi alla Vodka you've ever had in your life. The sauce is so light that it lures you into thinking you could eat it forever. But be careful. It sneaks up on you and you forget you haven't had your entrees yet. And if you're feeling extra gluttonous, try and sneak some dessert in there. We had the Strawberry Balsamic Funnel Cake. So good it was stupid. Couldn't stop eating it.  The place is beautiful. The service was top notch. Courtney was attentive and personable.   This place is worth every penny. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the meal was flawless.",

    "text": "Finally had the opportunity to check this place out. I have been meaning to FOREVER, and when my parents received a gift card for Christmas and asked me to join them to check it out- I obviously had to say yes. They have valet parking, which is great. The restaurant is so cute and classy. It is just so charming and romantic- a perfect place for a really special date. Our server was awesome. I told him what I was looking for in a wine selection and he chose the perfect one (wish I could remember the name!) We started out with small salads and OMG. I didn't think a small salad before a meal could be so impressive. It was just so fresh and the dressing was so delicious. I wanted seconds and thirds, I loved it. We were given a bunch of toppings for the salad or bread, which was pretty cool. The bread was delicious and so were the oil and vinegars it was served with. The butter even seemed to be fancified in some way and was so tasty. Then, we were served pasta with vodka sauce. Now, their vodka sauce is just something special. It is so incredibly tasty. I really enjoyed it and practically licked the plate clean. Next, my meal, which was a medium well NY strip with some potatoes on the side. Honestly, my entree didn't blow me away. The steak was very good, but the potatoes were burnt. I mean, they were so crisp and oily, I could not enjoy them. The steak was a hefty portion but for the cost of the meal, I really was expecting a little more with this entree. Still, it was delicious and I enjoyed everything but the potatoes. For dessert, my mom and I split the raspberry tiramisu. OMG. Now, this.... BLEW me away. It was so unbelievable. Arguably, the best tiramisu I've ever tried in my life. I was in heaven while I consumed it. I highly recommend trying Alla Famiglia for yourself- it's a special experience. I do want to return, but I will just try another entree, as their menu changes almost daily.   Side Notes:  -They will customize a menu for you. Example: my parents were celebrating their 25th anniversary with their friends here and they called before and asked if their menus could mention their anniversary. Without hesitation, they created custom menus for my parents and their friends.  -You can come here simply for drinks or desserts. Personally, I tend to feel awkward doing so in nicer restaurants, but the wait staff said that it's completely fine to do so, and that they will even save you a spot at the bar or a table if you call ahead. Knowing this, I really want to come back for some wine and tiramisu in the near future!",

I've heard people rave about it - but it's such a nice restaurant that we just never found an occasion.   I made a reservation here for my husband's birthday. The atmosphere is really cute and intimate. We sat upstairs. The service was wonderful. They even printed special menus that said \"happy birthday Trey\" for my husband.   We ordered a bottle of wine and shared the smoked provolone appetizer at the recommendation of our server. It was so good! I've never seen anything like it. Also - the bread and dipping sauces they bring you are amazing! I loved the goat cheese in particular.   Both of our entrees came with a salad which was very good. I ordered a pasta entree (I'm vegetarian). My husband ordered a filet mignon, so his meal also came with a pasta course. It was SO much food and it was all amazing! I appreciated the hefty portions - often at fancy restaurants you get much smaller portions.   Beware, this place is pricey. All in all, we paid about $175 plus tip for our meal. But for a special occasion I definitely think it's worth it.",

    "text": "This is my second review of Alla Famalgia and again this place gets five stars. I loved every part of my meal. I started out with the twelve ounce stuffed meatball and the truffled mushroom appetizers. The waiter invited me to watch as the mushrooms were being prepared at the kitchen counter. There I chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. Explaining as he went on, first slicing fresh chantrel, portobellos, and button mushrooms. Next he saute them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice take on an old favorite. For the four of us the bill was over 300 dollars, but well worth it for the attentive service and extremely well prepared food.",

The appitizers were enough to fillyou up.  We had the stuffed meatball which is the size of a softball.  Melt in your mouth.  The pasta courses have alway been right on.  FOr main course we have tried several, all fantastic but the veal chop was out of this word, huge, perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Jonathan's mom made one of the desserts, a pumkin mousse/chiffon cake that my son said was the best he has ever tasted.  he requested I try to duplicate it for next Thanksgiving.  In a word or two: Outstanding, pricey but worth it.",

I can now finally go here and just grab an app' at the bar without having the customary food coma afterwards after his multicourse feast.  He's upgraded the staff and kept the pro's from the past (marney and errol).  Steve and Clint are good newer additions as server and bartender.  This is only my second 5 star review, probably should deserve 4.5, but wtf it's so obvious he cares and appreciates the business so much.  The food is still great, the patio is nice, the hood' location is still scary and fun and the smaller menu items and additional staff are appreciated.  I do wish he had more options than just italian wine, but last night we were able to find a great white.  The salmon carpaccio last night is the best I've ever had.  The mussels with diablo sauce was also excellent.  I  don't know of any other small restaurant chef in Pittsburgh that takes as much care in the quality of ingredients used (except for Douglas Dick at Bona Terra).  In my original post I said it was a bit pricey, but I've decided it's well worth the cost now.  I also tried a ceviche here that was out of this world.  There's definitely a lot more to have at this italian place than just pasta and red sauce.",

    "text": "My boyfriend & I went to Alla Famiglia for our (late) Valentine's Day dinner last night. We don't go out & splurge like this often, so we were really excited for a special dinner. The food was out of this world (bread & sides, salad, pasta alla vodka and veal chop Milanese), but the service was absolute garbage. I've seriously been treated better at a TGIFriday's. We waited, pretty much unattended to, at the bar until 8:20 for an 8:00 reservation. Once seated, I practically had to beg for a wine list. We called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. The cab was taking forever, so we called a different company. As my boyfriend was talking with the cab company, a waitress walked by. We heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff, \"UGH, those people at the bar are JUST now ordering a cab.\" It was 10:30. On a Saturday night.  I don't know if it was the fact that we were some of the youngest patrons in there (early/mid 20s), but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time. Maybe if we were in our 50s like everyone else, they would've treated us like adults.  When I plunk down $160 for one of the most highly-recommended restaurants around, I expect to be treated like I'm spending $160 at your restaurant. Despite how great the food was, I won't be returning. SO disappointed.",

Don't go here if you are in a rush, because the entire dining experience will take several hours.  But we were there to enjoy the night, so we did not care.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone as long as you are willing to spend the money.  If you do  appetizers, drinks and dinner it will run about $100 a person.

They start you off with freshly baked bread accompanied with olive oil with basil and pepper, a chickpea, pepper flakes and cheese mix, and a goat cheese and walnut spread. The next course is a salad with red wine vinaigrette with olives, roasted red peppers and raisins. They bring out a pasta with vodka sauce about 5 minutes before the entrees, sort of like a side to the meal. My boyfriend got the Veal Chop Milanese which was excellent, soft with a crispy crust. I got the Seafood Diavolo, it was pure seafood heaven for me. It had a nice spicy kick to it, without being overbearing. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly.

While it was a bit of a drive from Cranberry Township, we needed a dining reprieve after a disappointing visit at BRAVO! Cucina Italiana.  East Warrington Avenue is undergoing major construction which made finding parking a bit difficult, fortunately there is valet service in a lot to the side of the restaurant which we took advantage of.   Upon entering, we were warmly welcomed by the host.  We visited on a stormy evening and were fortunate to find that some reservations had been cancelled due to the weather, which enabled us to get a table.  I strongly advise to get reservations in advance.  We were seated on the first floor with a view of the chefs cooking.  Awesome. All that has been said in prior reviews, I heartily agree with.  The bread, cheese, and dipping oil was a delicious start.  Ingredients were fresh.  The pasta and main course dishes were done perfectly.  My wife had the Gorgonzola Filet Mignon, which she described as one of the best meals she has ever eaten. When we are in the area, we'll be back.",

    "text": "Incredible experience up here, I would have to say that this goes down as one of my most memorable dining experiences in Pittsburgh for a number of reasons. I personally love this style of Italian cooking. Sicilian, so folks who are not familiar should take look at their menu online before coming because it might catch you off guard, it isn't what the \"normal\" Italian restaurant offers.   I had a great experience dodging potholes on my way through the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh which it makes it much more awarding arriving with my wheels of my vehicle still in alignment. They have valet parking which is great because it takes the stress out of trying to find parking.  Upon entering I almost fainted at the smells and views of this place. Right when I walked in I saw an array of freshly prepared vegetables that were on a table in the kitchen area. It was beautiful and really made realize right then what kind of place this was. The service we had was second to none. Right from entering we were promptly seated and received an explanation of everything that was on the table for our enjoyment. The \"Holy Oil\" was ridiculous and almost addicting I couldn't stop drowning the fresh bread in that stuff that I think I ruined my appetite.  Folks when you come here don't eat lunch because the food dishes are huge. We ordered an appetizer of Mussels Diavolo which had a huge amount of decent mussels in a spicier tomato sauce. The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn't waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people.   Then be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner.  I then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can't figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I'm eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review.  I did think that it might be hard to come here if you don't eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don't know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork.  I wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER. If anybody has any suggestions on how I can do this place more often please let me know!",

    "text": "Some people train for marathons, other people train for this meal. Before sitting down make sure you get in the proper state of mind and prepare yourself for a long night of indulgence. This being my first dining experience at Alla Famiglia, I was unaware of the challenge that I had undertaken. We had A Party of Five, empty bellies and an optimistic mentality; we couldn't resist the tempting appetizers recited to us and ended up ordering the mega meatball, calamari and shrimp, and sausage over polenta. All were amazing. The meatball was the highlight: twelve ounces of perfectly cooked beef, filled with mozzarella and covered in sauce and provolone (kisses fingers). Big plus for including the tentacles in the calamari. I've noticed these legs less and less while dining out, when did they lose suction as a staple of a calamari appetizer? Also adorning our table were a few clothing options in which to dress the bread, all of them enjoyable on their own or as an ensemble.  One would think after such a hearty opener all that remained was the main course. How wrong of an assumption that turned out to be. Before we could even think about crushing our dinners, we had to face two formidable courses of salad and pasta. As mentioned by other reviewers, the salad is great. Nice dressing, nice fillers, nice roughage. The pasta that's included with the entree was a fusilli bucati in a vodka sauce served family style. Unable to pass up the promise of a great carbonara with guanciale and fresh egg, we had two pasta opponents to tackle. Both were cooked so perfectly al dente I would have put them on my NHL all-star ballot as a write-in if voting hadn't already closed.  At this point in the meal, I had completely forgotten that I still hadn't even seen my main course. And I was fine with that. As a table we compiled quite the culinary collection: bistecca fiorentina, veal milanese, veal marsala, mussels in a diavola sauce and the sea bass special for the evening. You know when a meal is so utterly divine that you just stop talking to everyone around you and have a one on one pow wow with the gastro-gods? Yeah, that's what happened. I will say at one point during the meal, my brother had to get up and take a walk around the restaurant for fear he would wake up two days later in the ICU if he didn't fight off the impending food coma that threatened his existence. Instead of napkins they should have given us a white towel and a trainer to throw it on the table for us because we were doing our best impression of Apollo Creed...and our food was Ivan Drago.  Our waiter, who we thought was our friend, then had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert, some balls on that guy. Of course we wanted dessert. We decided on the tiramisu which I hope had a clean bill of health because it blew our minds. It was so good that I was upset with myself. I did exactly what I hate seeing someone do on any and every food network show. I took a bite, put down my fork, closed my eyes and just said, \"wow!\" I just hope it was as good for the tiramisu.  Other housekeeping items: you can bring your own wine for which they charge a corking fee. All the water is bottled, but I didn't see it on the bill so I figure it's included. The chef/owner is extremely friendly and accessible, as he is cooking basically right next to your table. Parking at the meters next to the building is free after 6pm, despite what it says on the signs; our waiter informed us they have an unspoken agreement with the parking authority.  Heavy on the belly, heavy on the wallet, heavy in our hearts!",

    "text": "Might be the best restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh! Made reservations on a Friday evening at 9:00PM for two.  Apps: The service was great, the server knew all menu items in detail by heart. We started with 2 appetizers my fiance wanted the Calamari and Shrimp that was in a garlic, herb lemon sauce...best shrimp I have ever had, they were colossal! I ordered the Meatball stuffed with bufala mozzarella smothered in a plum tomato sauce, it was unbelievable!  The salads course was great and I'm not a salad guy. We were both almost full at this point and we still had the pasta and entree course ahead.  The Pasta Course: The owner wheels out a cart to our table with a whole wheel of Locatelli Pecorino Romano, in which he will use to make our Cacio e Pepe, table side. He pours 2 portions of linguini on top of the cheese wheel, adding the heavy cream, EVOO and pepper, he mixes and digs into the top layer of the cheese wheel and serves it into our bowls.  Entrees: I ordered the Veal Chop Milanese, I was so full at this point I took 2 bites out of my Veal and couldn't go anymore, but this was the best veal chop I have ever had, had to take the rest home. My Fiance, she ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, but was equally as full, the fish was perfectly prepared and melted in your mouth, she took all, but 2 bites home also. Unbelievable experience!!",

    "text": "UPDATED: Just wanted to share that we attempted to visit for a third time when my husband's brother was in town in mid-November of 2014.  We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \"no, it's not ready yet.\"  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \"can we get you a drink on the house?\" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \"that's for a reservation.\" \"Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\"  \"They must have specifically requested that table.\"  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.  My husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!    While my husband enjoys many of the more \"up and coming\" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.  Let's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...  I've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first.   The second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.  Finally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.",

    "text": "One of the best meals that I have had in PIttsburgh.  We had the mussels in a slightly spicy red sauce, and their meatball.  For both of these appetizers, the sauce was amazing - the best that I have had.  So good that I could have happily made a meal out of the sauce and their bread, which was hot and fresh.  For our entres, we had the lamb chops and the veal chops, cooked Milanese style.  Both dishes were cooked perfectly - the Milanese was pan fried and a bit delicately flavored, but wonderful.  The service was very good, and all the staff were working very hard and quick, but were available to answer questions and assist us when needed.  I would recommend making reservations well in advance and trying to get one of the tables upstairs - a more quiet and intimate setting, also slightly more comfortable temperature wise for me.  The kitchen is downstairs, and is open to the dining room, so I think we got some of the heat. I will definitely go back there someday.",

The food, service, and ambiance were always top notch.  All of the glowing, positive reviews you see are correct - this is truly the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  When we visited Alla Famiglia for New Year's Eve 2017, we were excited to find out about their ballroom and immediately decided that we wanted to have our wedding and reception there.  Bill and Lisa worked tirelessly with us to develop our menu and plan the entire event, down to the last details.  Mai worked up personalized cocktails for the bride and groom, which everyone loved, as well.  When it came to the flawless execution of our wedding ceremony and reception, Bill and Lisa made sure that everything was perfect and went according to plan.  Our guests (approx. 100) all loved the entire experience - the ballroom was gorgeous and the food and service were second to none, as we'd previously experienced on our own.  Alla Famiglia's staff were as attentive to our guests as they were to us, with everyone's' glasses full and plates brimming with delicious food.  We were very amazed to find that the same standards that we'd experienced during our private dining occasions at Alla Famiglia were applied to our 100 guest reception - everything was just as phenomenal as if they were cooking and serving the two of us.  From start to finish, we couldn't expect a more perfect experience for our day - a huge thank you to Bill, Lisa, and the rest of the Alla Famiglia staff for making our day all the more memorable.  We highly recommend checking out Alla Famiglia for a romantic dinner, or for your special event!!  We can't wait to go back!!!",

    "text": "A large group of us went for dinner Monday night. We were an hour late for our reservation.  They had no problem accommodating us, which was great.   After drinks at the bar we were seated upstairs in the original building of the restaurant. The bartender upstairs was also our waiter. He was well versed in the menu and it was clear he had worked here for a long time and really knew his stuff.   Of course we got the meatball and the smoked provolone. Both were good. The meatball, while big, was not amazing though. I don't understand the hype.  You can find smaller meatballs just as good at Emporio.  Salad course was not exciting. I thought it was overdressed.   The pasta came out next. Their cavatappi alla vodka is to die for. I don't know if I can eat ordinary pasta again. I'm now spoiled. I took the leftovers home in a doggy bag and did not tell my family because I don't want to share!  On to the main event...the entree.  I ordered the seafood diavola (which was not on our waiter's list of recommendations). I should have listened to what was left unsaid. I was disappointed in the dish.  As it was served, I immediately smelled that it was fishy, which is never a good sign. The shrimp was over cooked and tough as well as the lobster tail. Coming from Massachusetts where the fresh lobstah is amazing, I've come to expect that Pittsburgh does not know lobster, but I figured they couldn't really mess up shrimp. But sadly it happened. Luckily I was pretty full from all the rest of the food. I haven't dived into my leftovers yet, but I'm hoping it's better the second time around. But for a $58 dish it was very disappointing.   Desserts were ordered for the table.  We had the raspberry tiramisu, the ice cream and funnel cake and some cookies (and cream-i think).  We were not blown away by any of the desserts. But we all agreed that the ice cream funnel cake was the best. The cookies were hard and therefore hard to eat. The raspberry tiramisu, which I compare to Prantl's burnt almond torte, comes in second place.   I will go back, even if it's only for the pasta and the service.",

An experience at Alla Famiglia is a marathon not a sprint and the staff do such a great job at providing that relaxed and enjoyable meal from the first course to the last. It is worth every penny and I'm so grateful I was able to experience what they have to offer for my birthday. It's great for any special occasion! I could go into extensive detail about everything but take my word for it and find out for yourself. Thank me later.",

    "text": "This is the real deal folks! If you didn't read all the other reviews saying the exact same thing, then trust me when I say this is hands down the best Italian restaurant in the area - maybe the tri-state area!   My Mom is one of those ladies who appreciates a food experience on her special day so, after being scared away for years (seriously, my only constructive critique - the online reservation process needs to be tweaked if you want to get reservation procrastinators like me), I finally called and left a message about reserving a table. Upon receiving notice that a table was reserved, off we went...   And what an experience it was! The ambiance is great. Service was stellar. There were lots of little extras that made this evening one to remember, from the complementary photo-with-mom for her birthday to the gift of dessert, these touches were appreciated and made us feel so welcome. The food was the absolute best. I don't eat veal as a rule, but it's what my Mom wanted and I did taste it and it was heavenly. The pasta side, while traditional/simple, was toothsome and the sauce was the best red sauce I've ever had in my life. I got the fluke stuffed with crabmeat with tiger shrimp (best shrimp ever!), and everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Every little element, down to the blood-orange palate cleanser, was an explosion of flavor and texture and richness. The portions are huge too - we each had two more meals out of our leftovers!  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves food. Our trip to Alla Famiglia is one we will always remember with fondness and we both hope to be back soon!",

It was recommended by our server, who was amazing, and it did not disappoint!!! It was the most delicious cheese appetizer I have ever tried.   We ordered our entrees which are accompanied by a fresh and delicious house salad with gorgonzola course and a pasta caponata all vodka course.  We drizzled the oil and sprinkled fresh parmesan on top for extra flavor  although, the freshness and flavor of the pasta was second to none.   Entrees: Tough decision:   Veal Marsala and Veal Chop Pizzaiola....just wow!  Needless to say, We had to take home two to go boxes! Come Hungry!   Two Dirty Martinis ... and we were just as stuffed as our bleu cheese olives.   my new favorite fine dining experience in Pittsburgh!  We will be back soon!",

    "text": "WOW! but seriously... WOW!!! Alla Famiglia is 5 star dinning at its finest. I am truly blown away over my experience at Alla Famiglia. This past Friday, I went here for the first time with my husband & another couple, who we dine out with often. 2 days later, and we can not stop talking about the food and service we received at this outstanding restaurant. I think it is safe to say this is by far one of the best dinning experiences I've ever had in my life, and I've eaten at places all over the world. It is certainly #1 in the area. If you ever go her, ask for Courtney. She is AWESOME! So knowledgeable and more than friendly. We can not wait to share another dinning experience with her next month as we immediately booked another reservation after her outstanding service and incredible food.  Once seated, they take your drink orders & you are served bread with 3 different spreads/dips made fresh & placed on the table. The server warned us not to fill up on bread, so we all tried not to over-do it. You are given a cheese and chickpea mix, an infused olive oil dip, as well as goat cheese and walnut spread with a kind of sweetness. All 3 fantastic. For appetizers, we got the giant meatball and the prosciutto wrapped shrimp. When they describe the meatball as \"Gigante\", that is no exaggeration. It was plenty the the 4 of us to have a nice size portion, and it was smothered in marinara, which I love! The prosciutto wrapped shrimp came with 4 shrimp served over a bed of arugula, with a squeeze of lemon. Again, delicious and perfect for the 4 of us to share.  Next, we were served house salad family style. All Alla Famiglia entrees come with salad and pasta vodka for the table. This salad was SO GOOD! The red wine vinaigrette was perfect and you were given a large bowl of gorgonzola to add to the salad at no additional cost. You could taste the freshness in both the salad and the cheese. Honestly, I would go back here just for the house salad alone, it was THAT good!  Then, it was time for the cavatappi alla vodka. I would like to mention that each and every time a new course came out, you were given a fresh plate and silverware. Table maintance at Alla Famiglia is on point! From someone who used to be a server for years, I really appreciate. The pasta was also served family style and was amazing. At this point, I was getting so full I had no idea how I was going to eat my meal! The pasta portion was very large. We even had leftovers. As for entrees, I got the pizzaiola, which is house veal sausage in the signature marinara with both sweet and spicy peppers and provolone... truly AMAZING! My husband got the Veal Parmigiana and it was absolutely the best veal I have ever tasted in my life. It melted in your mouth! Next time we go back I think I am going to get it for myself! The other couple we were with got the veal piccatta and chilean sea bass. I did not try the piccatta, but our friend said it was the best piccatta he ever ate. The sea bass was a HUGE piece of fish with shrimp, spinach, mushrooms covered in a really great sauce. It was delicious! Alla familigia foes not mess with \"chicken entrees\" but goes straight for the veal in any option you can think of, True Italians! Everyone took most of their entrees home because we were all so full from the first 3 courses but would not dare waste a morsel of this amazing food!  For dessert, we got two scoops of gellato with espressos and cappuccino. The gelato was perfect for the table to share, in fact, we couldnt even finish it all. The hot beverages came with sugar cubes and were all really good. After dinner, we headed upstairs to check out the bar and had a couple more drinks. All the drinks were great and again, we received fantastic service at the bar. We also learned that Alla has a shuttle van and will pick you up and take you home anywhere within city limits. Also, we learned the cut their own ice blocks, infuse their own tequila as well as olive oils, and sell their homemade sauce. They also have a beautiful small ballroom for special events. I wish I would have known about this whenever I was looking for a place to have my rehearsal dinner. I see a lot of people complaining that All Famiglia is expensive, but is it really you the amount of food you get and the outstanding service? Absolutely everything is homemade from the ice to the food and you are guaranteed to get at least 2 meals out of it with all the leftovers you take home. And you can get a ride too? That is amazing! If you have not been to Alla Familiga yet, I 100% recommend it. In fact, book your reservation right now! You can book weekdays on their website but if you're looking for a weekend, give them a call. And don't forget to request Courtney as your server! You will not regret it. After dinning at All Famiglia, I don't think I will ever be able to go back to another mediocre Italian restaurant. This place is the REAL DEAL!  Really looking forward to going back next month for my birthday.",

The only bad thing I can say is that the lobster tail was $135...yes really. We should have asked the price, but the waiter should have warned us. The tiramisu was not the usual tiramisu, but it was great. Very almondie tasting.",

    "text": "Found on Yelp naturally and was given the go-ahead from a few friends locally who had five-star experiences there as well. The moment we arrived the owner came outside to greet us and valet parked the car for us. We were celebrating mine and my grandmother's birthdays in style, and I'll tell you, they sure know how to make you feel like royalty and at home all at once. We were seated at \"The Don's\" table as I like to call it -- right next to the appetizer chef. Everyone from our waiter, to the chefs, the kitchen, and the hostesses, were all so informative and welcoming. Lauren, the owner, stopped by to hang out and chat with my grandparents about the restaurant which made the experience so warm and personal for them. I was pleased to bring them here having grown up just a few miles away- my folks have lived in the same nearby neighborhood long enough to see the rise and fall of the area, but I had a great feeling about Alla Famiglia and the revitalization of Allentown in general (though the restaurant has been there long before the comeback of AT). Needless to say, they were blown away, we all were- the food, the proximity, the hospitality, every single thing was on point. I was a big fan of the chef's descriptions and conversation during the meal, the decor and, of course, the food itself. This is a bonafide family-run Italian restaurant. The real deal. Nothing even comes close to this on the west coast. Everything was just perfect and we were treated to decadent chocolate birthday cupcakes at the end of our 4 course meal. All in all, an experience unlike any other and I am looking forward to returning next time we are in town. Grazie mille!!!",

The food is always fresh and delicious, and the ambiance is warm and comfortable.  It is not possible to leave here hungry or unsatisfied. If you can save room for dessert you've got more willpower than me.   Yes, it can be expensive here if you arrive hungry. Just remember that before your entree arrives there is a lot included in the price. you are going to receive fresh hot Italian bread with olive oil and a topping on the side that includes chic peas, and other little goodies to place on top of the bread. Then a big salad served family style. Then a big bowl of vodka sauce pasta. By now it's possible you're already full. But the you realize you've ordered the appetizer- a huge meatball and/or the greens and beans with sausage.   Now you are really full , but your phenomenal entree is coming. My favorite is the huge veal chop. If you order this DON'T order an appetizer or you will hate yourself for not being able to finish it!   Jonathan is in the process of expanding the place to the space next door because the place is usually packed.   If you can't make it here, try Jonathan's other restaurant called Arlecchino I'm Cannonsburg PA. It's in an old schoolhouse with outdoor seating. Many of the same delicious menu items and maybe a little lower price. But still the same quality and awesomeness.",

Everything you've heard is absolutely True. Excellent service, huge portions, and out-of-this-world food. Honestly, words cannot describe how much I love Alla Famiglia. This top-notch experience, however, does come at a price, but it is so worth it. Trust me. I'm cheap as all get out but I would gladly come back to Alla Famiglia any day. So FYI, expect to spend around $200 (for two people).   I am going to recommend everything my husband and I ordered, but if I had to pick only one item to recommend, it would be the filet mignon. Alla Famiglia is known for their veal chops and while I thought the veal chop Milanese my husband ordered was divine, the filet I ordered was a hair more fantastic. It was tender, buttery, and the sweet and cream gorgonzola cream sauce just added the extra boost to make it the best filet I've had in my life. These entrees came with salads and pasta and even the sides were also among the best I've had.   If you're looking for an awesome dining experience and amazing Italian food, stop reading Yelp reviews and make a reservation already!",

    "text": "After hearing about AF and reading the reviews, I was expecting an amazing experience. We made reservations weeks in advance and I counted down the days. Finally, D day arrived. We arrived and quickly valeted the car. I would definitely suggest you valet. The neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy. Into the restaurant I happily galloped. What a cute little place. Open kitchen in the first room. We sat in the second room. Homey, old school Italian feel. The server explained the menu and took our drink order. Hubs and I split a bottle of wine. Nothing better than a good bottle of red wine with a hearty Italian meal.   We were ready to eat. I dug into the bread on the table and thoroughly enjoyed the holy oil dip. So much so that I didn't even bother with the other two spreads. The menu was very veal heavy. I guess that's their specialty but not what I was looking for. I chose the filet gorgonzola. Our first course was salad. Served family style this salad was savory and sweet with raisins and gorgonzola on the side. Then we waited, and waited and waited. They are definitely not in a rush here. The next course was pasta with vodka sauce. After reading the reviews, I was a little disappointed that we were not offered the alfredo cheese wheel as an option. The vodka sauce was lacking flavor for me. I added a little chili oil and it brightened up some. Again we waited and waited. Finally, our entrees arrived. My filet was cooked well and tender. However, I did not care for the peppers and creamy sauce it was topped with. Also, this was the only part of the meal that I had left overs to take home. For me, the portion sizes were about average. I did not have mounds of left overs as other reviews noted. We opted to skip dessert. Overall, it was a good meal but nothing blew me away. I had high hopes for AF and was slightly let down. For the price, I have had better meals and better service at other restaurants around the city.",

We had not  been here in years so seeing the bar upstairs was brand-new to us. The cocktails were fantastic! While we were up there, we met the owner, and he made some recommendations to us. You have to get a meatball appetizer to split with the table.  Four of us split one and it was plenty. They had littleneck clams on special and they were done absolutely perfectly.  Our husbands got Veal Parmesan and loved it. We also had beans and greens appetizer it was delicious.  Next time, I would probably get it without the sausage. It was delicious but I'm not much of a sausage person.There were so many other things that we could've ordered it was hard to decide. You really feel like you are at someone's house when you're eating there. I would only want to sit in the front room to see the kitchen.  We still were able to bring our own wine there like so many years ago. We will be back again very soon. If you have never been here... you definitely need to go. And  if you haven't been in a while you need to get back there.",

To start off we got the meatball appetizer. (Which is more than enough to feed 4 people, we had to take it home and it is to die for) then they brought out a pasta dish with vodka sauce .(which is also to die for) and for the main course I had the cowboy steak Gorgonzola. Which absolutely changed my life. And my girl had the linguini del mare. Which she said was very good. This establishment is not only one of the best in the region, it's one of the best eating establishments in the country. And I would recommend to anyone that is visiting the area or those who live here and haven't tried it yet. Also, don't let the neighborhood that it's in scare you, they have a safe valet parking service. I hope this review helped... Enjoy!",

This is definitely a restaurant to bookmark and remember for the ages.  Reminds me of the old style Italian restaurants that used to be in Bloomfield when that area was just a horrid place to go.  Well, Alla Famiglia is in the Allentown area which is not a neighborhood of choice.  Yes, your car is guarded in a private secure lot!!  Get over the location, this is the gem of gems!  Old style design in a charming old building with copper and huge fans.  The kitchen is right there for you to watch and its worth watching this chef do his thing!  The dishes come out hot, no waiting, the service staff is like a tag team and they all share duties to get the food to you once its ready.  The quality of the food was impeccable and the 5 course presentation was really enjoyable...  Oh and dessert was to die for; Belgium chocolate gelato in a fresh waffle cone and the creamiest NY cheesecake you ever had with a hint of orange zest...",

I travel a lot for work and have enjoyed the benefit of eating at some of the finer establishments in NY, LA, Chicago, SF and London.   True, it's in a HORRIBLE part of town (there was a robery at the liquor store next door about 10 minutes before we left) and the place is tiny.  But, you will not be sorry about making the trek to this place.    I got the Cowboy Steak Gorgonzola, but someone in your party has to get one of the veal dishes, they are out of this world.  You can have the veal smothered in the Gorgonzola sauce from the steak, which was amazing (also probably took 5-10 minutes off my life span, but oh well).  On the flip side, don't be fooled into thinking that because the place is in a war-zone and it's small that you'll get a good deal.  It was also one of the more expensive meals I've had in some time.  So, be prepared to have a great meal, but you will pay for it.

Food was top notch.  My only complaint would be that there was too much of it !    The Lamb Chops were fantastic. Our kids shared a serve and they had to fight us off.  I had the House Specialty, \" Veal Chop Milanese\"  and was very impressed.  Hard to fault any of the food actually.  From the bread and Holy Oil that starts the meal, through the appetizers, the salad and the pasta, on to the mains.  Everything was stunning.

However the food is so amazing that you're happy to have leftovers in the refrigerator that you will actually reheat and eat...usually my leftovers sit in there until I realize it is way past time to throw them out.  Not so with this place.    The service is friendly and family-like.  The ambience is warm and welcoming.

BUT the steps are very large and easy to maneuver with heels on. We sat on the original side where the original bar is.   Our server was fantastic. He was so knowledgeable and quiteee the salesman but not in a cheesy or annoying upselling way. he simply said the facts and let the food speak for its self. We had smoked provolone with truffle and truffle oil. It was AMAZING. I didn't get to take a pic because the waiter actually cut it and served it to each of us. The portions of the food were intense. Not like what you would get at most upscale/fine dining restaurant for the price. No skimping out on food at all!! Of course I tried all of my coworkers dishes as well. Needless to say- I CANT WAIT to go back!",

We sat at the bar when we arrived and had some wine. Cerita and the other bartender (sorry couldn't remember your name) were great and we were looking forward to dinner. Dinner is a multi step process bread, salad, pasta, and then the main course. We were warned ahead of time how to prepare, don't eat too much bread, but the spicy olive oil is very good. But the pasta and main course were nothing special, good but nowhere near what I expected so it was a real let down. If you are into big portions you'll love it but we couldn't store it at the hotel so the valet had a great meal with our leftovers. The search for the best Italian in Pittsburgh goes on.  Too bad Jonathan doesn't care enough to send a response. I won't be back.",

We sat down, next to the GM of the Penguins Jim Rutherford and said Hi.  I don't know if that's what set her off or what but she turned sour and everything we asked her turned into a painstaking chore for her to respond.  We will NEVER sit at her bar again...

I had a large party so they seated us on the top floor which was a private room to ourselves. The service was impeccable. Our waitress made sure to go over the menu and explained everything in detail. The food was amazing. Hands down best Italian food I've had in Pittsburgh. Each course is served with a side of pasta and house salad. The house pasta they serve is a vodka sauce cavatappi but I got the cacio e Pepe special. The portions are huge so come hungry!",

The meatball appetizer is AMAZING, the sauce is delicious and the meatball is delectable.  Pasta is amazing, the veal chop pizzaiola style was to die for, and the filet was perfection! A nice surprise was the blood orange palate cleanser between the salad and pasta course! Alla Famiglia was kind enough to take a photo of us upon arrival and event sent out a delicious cupcake for dessert to help make our anniversary special!

    "text": "Overall, this was a fantastic meal with fantastic service; but I did leave with a couple of suggestions, so I rounded down a bit.     Our group of six filtered into the bar.  Bar service was slow-ish, but the bartender was very knowledgeable and helpful, so I didn't really mind it.  Our pregnant friend appreciated the assistance with a mock-tail and we all appreciated not being forced to cash out when we went to the table.     The table they sat us at was a touch cramped for 6, but we made it work.   There was a wine-glass casualty though as we tried to arrange our menus and such.  Within seconds, someone swooped in to clean it up and the server never missed a beat.     Our server was also the sommelier.   At first, we questioned whether he was even old enough to drink, but he had a polish and professionalism that far surpassed his young appearance.  He described the dishes expertly and offered thoughtful suggestions.   He also made a special effort to assist the vegan in our group with her selections, even returning after discussing with the chef to suggest a non-menu item she might prefer.   Service was excellent overall.    Which brings me to the food.  Loved all of it.  I have a hard time getting excited about a salad, but they do an excellent salad here.  I could have easily made a meal out of the bread, salad, and pasta courses alone.  But that's not really how it works, so I also got the house specialty veal chop.  This thing was huge and very tasty.   I took half of it home in a box.  I also sampled the filet mignon, which I will definitely order next time.     While the entrees do have hefty price tags, you do get a complete meal and it didn't seem that outrageous at the end of the day.  I'd go back for sure.     So what are the suggestions?... - Table was a little crowded (as noted above).   - We had some extra salad, bread, and pasta; which are served family style.  They simply disappeared rather than being boxed up.  Both were delicious and I hated to see the leftovers go to waste.    - The valet was a total jerk to about half of our party.  That's just not ok.",

I won a giftcard to here and I sat down and was immediately greeted with bread, a salad, then pasta, and by the time I made it to my entree I was questioning if I would make it home as at that point someone was going to have to peel me out of my seat as a food coma is imminent! I enjoyed my stuff salmon as it was delish and it wasn't over cooked but I fell in love with dessert. The tiramisu made me want to marry it. It was topped with almonds and paired with seasonal fruits. The dessert melted in my mouth and I'm certain I wanted to melt in my seat. I had cocktails when I was here but the flavors in food steal the show. I would insist on sharing a meal as the portions warrant to go plates. This just might be my fav Italian spot in Pittsburgh.",

My boyfriend and I chose to splurge for our anniversary, and I'm so glad we did! Everything from the food to the service was impeccable.   All of the employees we interacted with, from the hostess to the servers to our waitress, were incredibly kind and attentive. Since it was our first time, our waitress went over the menu with us and gave us a few suggestions, which we appreciated.   The warm bread that they set the table with is a delicious way to start the meal. They give you three dips--a seasoned \"holy oil,\" a goat cheese and walnut spread, and a chickpea and cheese mixture. We ordered the smoked provolone appetizer and it was divine! Salty, smoky, cheesy perfection! Next up is their house salad served family style with a bowl of gorgonzola on the side so you can add it to your liking. Usually, salads are a bit of an afterthought, but not here. It was delicious! Our waitress then brought us out a tiny bowl of blood orange sorbet, which was a refreshing surprise. Then the pasta with vodka sauce came out, and we were given a bottle of chili pepper infused oil to add some spice, which really hit the spot. I used some bread to soak up all of the extra sauce because it was so amazing. After this course, I was feeling pretty full, and I couldn't believe that we still hadn't even gotten to our entrees!! I ordered the seafood diavola and my boyfriend got the veal chop milanese. Both were incredible. The seafood in my dish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was delicious--again, glad I had that bread to soak up some of the sauce! The veal was HUGE, pan fried with crab meat on top. He ended up taking half of it to go. Sadly, but not surprisingly, after all of this food we were too full for dessert, but I would have loved to try their raspberry tiramisu! Next time I'll try to stop myself from eating all of the bread and save some room.  We ended up spending $200, including tip and a glass of wine, but I definitely feel like we got our moneys worth. I love how all of the entrees come with salad and pasta. You don't see that often. I also loved the pace of the meal. We never felt rushed but we never waited more than 5 minutes for more food to appear in front of us. I'll definitely recommend Alla Famiglia to friends looking for a special meal, and I'll definitely be back!",

The best by far was the lobster special. It was freaking HUGE, and tasted really good despite the size (large lobster can be a little tough). My husband really likes the filet.   We have also tried various drinks and desserts. I like to get the drink of the day, because it is usually pretty original. I haven't found a dessert I didn't like yet.

Our server was very helpful in navigating the menu with us in order to help tailor the experience to us. For instance we wanted to try a lot of different items when we asked if we were ordering too much she made a few recommendations of a similar item that came in a smaller portion so we could have the selection we wanted. We were glad we listened because there was a lot of food. our meals came with a salad and a small pasta dish. That on top of the large meatball would've been enough regularly. We had entrees on top of that. There were other members of the wait staff quick to ask if we would like to take home an item after we finished with a course. The food was good as well.   Be ready for a lot of food and a very friendly environment!",

    "text": "If you haven't been to Alla Famiglia yet...RUN don't walk! Seriously this place is the real deal with extremely authentic Italian food and top notch service. I've dined at Alla twice now and was blown away each time. I'm telling you eating dinner here is a True event that you have to experience for yourself. Everything about this place is amazing from the outstanding service to the multiple courses of delicious homemade food. It is by far one of my best dining experiences to date and one of the best in the area. Ask for Courtney, she's an awesome server. We were lucky enough to have her on our first trip and asked for her again the next time we went. She's very knowledgeable about the menu and super friendly.   They offer a nice drink menu and it seems that they switch it up from time to time. I'd also like to mention that you can bring your own bottle of wine for a $25 cork fee.  First, you are served warm bread with 3 different dips/spreads. It's so easy to fill up on the bread because it's so freaking good so be careful there is a lot more food on the way! They give you a Cheese and chick pea mixture, a goat cheese and walnut spread and an infused olive oil. They are all fabulous and you must give each one a try.   As for appetizers, the giant meatball is a MUST! I'm confident in saying it's the best meatball ever. It's the size of a softball and drenched in sauce. It's plenty for 4 people to share.   After you're done with bread and appetizers, you will be served the house salad family style. This salad...omg it's perfection! The red wine vinaigrette is SO good. The raisins and walnuts give it a hint of sweetness. You are also given a bowl of gorgonzola so you can add as much as you want.   Next up is the cavatappi all vodka. All entrees are served with the salad and vodka pasta family style. This homemade vodka sauce is some of the best I've ever had and I have ordered it a lot at many different places. This sauce is light so you'll want to eat the whole bowl yourself. I would come back just for the salad and vodka pasta. If you don't want the vodka sauce I believe they also offer cacio e pepe which is made in front of you mixed in a cheese wheel. I need to try that on my next visit!  For my meals, I've had the sea bass and tuna that was on special one night. The sea bass is huge and cooked perfectly as was the tuna. I really really enjoyed the sea bass and would get it again. The tuna was served with huge pieces of crab and an orange sauce that was also really good. My boyfriend has had veal piccata and veal marsala. Both were fantastic and the best he's had. Alla offers a big selection of veal dishes, no chicken. I tried my friend's veal parm and I absolutely have to get it next time...wow! One thing I'd like to add is the table maintenance is outstanding here! You will never have a dirty dish on your table and will be given new silverware each time a new dish comes out.   For dessert, we had the gelato and raspberry tiramisu. Both were great, of course. The tiramisu is huge, also big enough for 4 people to share.   The one night we headed up to the bar and no surprise here had more wonderful service. All the drinks were excellent. The bartender informed us of the amazing happy hour specials they offer at the bar during the week. Seriously, these specials are insane and you need to check them out! We also learned that Alla has a shuttle service and will pick you up within city limits. So the next time we went we called the shuttle, I mean come on we had to give it a try with how great everything else had been. Tom the driver was the best! He was so kind and took great care of us on our ride.   Yes you will pay a little more for this dining experience but in all honesty it's not that expensive for the amount of food you get (pretty much 2 meals), the quality of the food, and the outstanding service. It's really worth every penny!! I know I'll be back soon and really look forward to it!",

It's not just the food.. it's the entire experience. Come hungry!! Definitely get the veal... it's what they are known for and I'm so glad that I did. Upgrade your pasta to the cheese wheel  this was prob my favorite part... the vodka pasta was good.. but there's just something about having your pasta tossed in a giant cheese bowl *insert mouth water here*. Another suggestion - go with friends so you can sample everyone's food.. we got a ton of apps that we shared and they were all amazing (prob why we were so full by the time the salads came but totally worth it). Smoke provolone cheese was the table favorite. Be prepared to spend some money, but trust me when I say it's definitely worth it!",

We started with drinks at the bar ( an Old Fashioned and an Aperol Spritz) which were delicious! We started with the Carpaccio, which was perfectly seasoned.  Dinner was an experience, and the food was delectable.",

However, after reading many 5 star reviews we thought..let's try it.  This place does not disappoint! The atmosphere is perfect, service wonderful, and food to die for. Salad with raisins soaked in marsala wine and gorgonzola cheese...yes please! Pasta Alla vodka... fantastic! But wait there's more...I got the seafood diavolo and they tamed down the spice for me Hubby got the diver scallops...both dishes do not disappoint! We discussed and voted this our favorite meal out in the burgh! We will most definitely be back for more delicious dishes and of course the wine!",

We were seated at the bar and were treated to a most delightful evening. The place has an authentic Italian menu, great wine and drink selection, and a rich ambience that really ties it all together. Great service provided by Jake. Our compatriots seated at the bar were very welcoming and friendly.   The food was amazing. Try the meatball. The filet was awesome. And the vodka cream sauce was well... fughedaboudit!

The Alfredo in the cheese wheel is an excellent alternative to red sauce.   I've tried just about every dish there and never had a bad meal.  The Veal Chop is by far my favorite.  Huge portions which usually come home!! ;) The atmosphere is a very quaint three story house, use valet parking, because the area is not the best! Lol but the police station is a cross the street.

Decided to try again since it was more about the \"get together\" than the food/location.  This time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.  I am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood.   I am NOT interested in ever going back!",

    "text": "Alla Famiglia is quickly becoming my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Where do we begin?  For starters, I appreciate an upscale restaurant that allows for BYOB. There is a $10 fee.  The table is set with fresh Italian bread and Holy Oil with banana peppers.  There is also a smal cheese plate served with chick peas and a goat cheese spread  Appetizer: Mussels in a tomatoe sauce was the best I've ever had. The sauce was amazingly flavorful.  My veal chop was prepared perfectly.   Worth the price of admission although expensive. We shared an entree and brought our own bottle, yet still managed to drop $110.  Sharing meals is also acceptable there because of portion size. $15 add on that includes an extra salad and side of pasta.   Only complaint was having dinner in the upstairs bar area where a Lemieux jersey was hanging on the wall. I love Mario, however, this isn't Fatheads.  I suppose the yinzer roots can't be completely ignored. In some ways it's charmingly Pittsburgh.",

When we informed him that we were going to the bar, he told us that we didn't have time to do that, because he expected us to be finished by 8:00 so that he could have a second seating, i.e. so that he could make more money. It was an unexpectedly crass statement for such an elegant (and expensive) restaurant. I felt rushed through our dinner. However my husband ignored our server's attempts to hurry us along; we dined beyond the 8:00 deadline.",

Staff was polite, selection was perfect, not overwhelmingly big or too limited. Most importantly of course, the food was AMAZING. I've eaten in many very notable restaurants around the country, and this one is right up there with the best of them. 5 stars across the board. Nothing too complain about whatsoever!",

    "text": "All I can say is.... O.M.G.  My husband and I went on our Honeymoon in Sorrento, Italy in October.  The food was so amazing!  Since we have been home we have been trying to find an authentic restaurant that actually lives up to real Italian cooking.  It took months... but we finally found it at Alla Famiglia.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing.   From the moment we walked in the door it had the feel of a little Italian place on a side street in Capri.  The wait staff was wonderful and very attentive.  They serve Aqua Panna, just as they would in Italy.  They also serve a wonderful hot bread with cheese spread, olive oil, and a small bean and cheese salad.  It was fabulous and unexpected.  Mistakenly, we ordered two appitizers (not knowing how much food we would be getting with our meals!).  We got the greens and beans and the pan seared shrimp and calamari.  Both were very tasty.  Our meals came with salad and a pasta course, which we did not realize at first.  I do wish the waiter would have told us, because we did order WAY too much food and didn't eat much of our meals because we were so full by the time they came out.  But everything was amazing, so I shouldn't be complaining.  First, they brought out our salads.  They were unique and very well presented with olives, raisins, and fresh roasted red peppers. So good!  A pasta course came next -- with a vodka sauce that was to die for.  I love a good vodka sauce but my husband isn't really a fan.  However, he couldn't stop talking about how good the pasta was!  I was impressed.  Finally, they brought out our meals.  I got a veal and house-made sausage dish with spinach, cherry tomato and beans.  It was absolutely wonderful.  My husband got a white fish with risotto.  I am not big on fish but it was also amazing and my husband said it was the best fish he has had in Pittsburgh.  To sum it up -- we are big fans now and I hope to go back soon!",

    "text": "This was my second time to Ala Famiglia.  It's been a few years, and we figured, the Saturday after Thanksgiving would be perfect for italian - a welcome break from turkey.  Unexpected, and awful problem with our experience.  Our party of nine was seated onetime for our 5 pm reservation.  Drink orders were taken, bread and assorted accoutrements of oil and such were brought to the table.  Waitress was pleasant, holiday tunes playing (over 6 separate speakers in the small upstairs bar/table area - quality sound, something I appreciate) and muted Penn State football game on the flat screen.  We were settled in for a good meal.    Appetizers arrived approximately an hour later.  They were quite good.  The 12 ounce meatball was fantastic.  It was covered in a great tomato sauce, and hit the spot.   We ordered the calamari, and even a second round of the prosciutto wrapped prawns.  Pasta arrived - it was good, but it should be at Ala Famiglia.    The dinners arrived at 7:25.   Yes, it was a 5:00 reservation.  At least it gave our Brunello time to breath.   The portions were big.  Lots of veal dishes, rib eyes, and filets.   Non cooked too long, or too short.    So why the mediocre review?  The long wait?  No.   We were in good company, and enjoyed being together.  The problem was the large number of fruit flies that were all over our table.  I first noticed them in one of the empty cocktail glasses.  They liked the remnants of the Manhattan - and the cherry left in the glass.   Three of them dead, two more flew away when I waived my hand.    That caused me to look over at my wine glass holding the $140 per bottle Brunello......yep, one dead, and one alive.  What do you do?  I fished out the dead one, and covered my glass with a cocktail napkin.  This was pretty disgusting.  We mentioned it to the waitress, but she didn't respond or summon a manager.  Not looking for a free meal or anything, but as a business owner myself, I would think they would want to know about the problem, and get it rectified asap.    I like the food, but I won't likely be back.  Oh, and for the 9 people, the meal was just shy of a $1,000.",

    "text": "Our all-time favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  We have been coming here for years and it never fails to provide a comfy, cozy, welcoming atmosphere and simply unbelievable food.  Let's start with the appetizers (you get bread and various dips before but please take my word for it, try not to eat it, you will thank me by the end of your meal).  My favorite is the meatball, it is giant, perfectly seasoned, sooo flavorful, covered with tons of sauce and gooey provolone cheese.  Seriously the best meatball you will ever have.  Make sure to share this bad boy with at least one other person because it is HUGE.  Next you get a salad with your entree.  The salad is refreshing, well balanced and very tasty.  Pine nuts, very sweet raisins (I love these things), gorgonzola cheese, nice dressing, peppers and greens.  Considering how heavy everything else is, the salad is perfect.  Next you're brought out pasta alla vodka.  The vodka sauce is creamy, flavorful and goes excellent with the spicy olive oil mix they give you.  If you like spicy make sure you put some of that oil on.  Now onto the mothership - Veal Milanese.  Let me end all debate and discussion - this is THE BEST VEAL CHOP YOU WILL EVER HAVE ANYWHERE.  Simply AMAZING.  Perfectly cooked, lightly breaded with pine nuts, crab meat, olive oil, natural juices, it is seriously PHENOMENAL.  MUST TRY!!!  Everything is great, but I have only tried those other items off other people's plates because I ALWAYS get the veal milanese.  However, the steak here is incredible as well.  Lastly, I love their take on Tiramisu very unique.  Let me say again, the best restaurant in Pittsburgh and THE BEST VEAL MILANESE IN THE WORLD.",

In a sketchy neighborhood, but its on the main street so plan to use their valet parking. Well worth the $6. Excellent friendly service. The food here is top notch, bring your appetite. We started with the delicious breads that came with many dips and spreads. I was a big fan of the goat cheese. For an appetizer we went with the meatball. The meatball itself was about the size of a softball and very delicious. The sauce on the appetizer was among the best I,ve ever tasted, right up there with the homemade sauces my Italian grandmother used to make. For the main course my wife had the mahi-mahi which she found to be delicious and I went with their signature veal chop. The style I chose for the veal chop was the sausage and peppers and the sausage was also amazing. The chop itself was to die for and looked like something right out of the Flintstones. Very tender and cooked exactly how I wanted it. For dessert we asked for the cheesecake but got tiramisu instead, but this mistake turned out to be a good one because the tiramisu was amazing. It is a non traditional style tiramisu with shaved almonds. Very delicious. Overall this was a fantastic dinner out for my wife and I and a very appreciated wedding gift. The total bill was quite pricey including the wine we had but if you want a special night out you will not be disappointed with Alla Famiglia!",

This is THE most underrated restaurant on Yelp in Pittsburgh. Great service, extremely friendly staff, fantastic atmosphere.  Be sure to come hungry. You cannot leave unsatisfied.

I am an avowed foodie and a wind snob and truly couldn't believe that I had not yet been here as I have dined at most all of the better restaurants in the Pittsburgh. area. Let me say that the food on the whole was very good but quite honestly I felt like the entire dining experience has a terrible inflated reputation. From the moment that we entered the restaurant with the kitchen right inside the front door to weaving our way through a maze of rooms and narrow stairwells, we found a place that completely lacked any ambiance and was quite loud. We were attended by a young waiter who I think had also inflated his knowledge telling us that at 26 he is in charge of all of the wines bought in the restaurant and then steering us towards a $260 bottle of super Tuscan. We chose something different, a lesser priced ST. Appetizer of beans and greens was quite good and nice presented and would easily feed four. The salad course was very good too. But then we received far too much of a pasta course which quite honestly was rather bland and tasteless and which both my partner and I had two bites of and set aside. Our main courses arrived which we were sharing. We ordered the lobster tail (though good not worth the $110 price tag) and the veal piccata, which was okay, not great, but okay.   At the end of the meal both my partner and myself looked at each other and said, Yes, it was a very good meal but nnot much in the way of ambiance or atmosphere and terribly pricey. Our bill for two being $366.00   I don't see a reason to rush back here. There are so many good Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh with as good as or better food (Joseph Tambellini's) and much more atmosphere. And I couldn't get out of my mind that the waiters must be paid on commission. JMHO",

Until further notice this may be the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. This has everything I look for in a restaurant - charming atmosphere, great cocktails, good service and most importantly, amazing food.   I had the Veal Milanese and would have a hard time ordering something else next time. This was by far the best veal dish I have ever had and at $65 I would almost call this a steal. The vodka sauce pasta starter that comes with it is wonderful in and of itself, and the salad, the salad is spectacular! That's the thing about this place, not a single aspect of the meal disappoints or falls short of amazing. I did not order an appetizer as I had to send some of the pasta back as well as some of the veal because I just couldn't eat it all - this will feel like a sin, but what can you do. I am sure the appetizers are amazing as well. Lets not forget the martini that I would say is about the best you're going to find in \"the Burgh\"! Not to mention it's BYOB, I brought my favorite bottle of California red wine to take the guess work out of the wine selection and guarantee an amazing amazing meal. (If you know your Italian wines and that's your thing then I would forget the BYOB)  Bottom line - this is the proverbial no-brainer, enjoy",

We skipped getting an appetizer just because of the amazing dips they bring to the table with bread. Also, our meals were served with an amazing salad, followed by some great pasta. I ended up taking the majority of my dinner home, which was the veal, and it was still great re-heated the following day. Well worth the money!",

We started with the smoked provolone and I swear nothing has ever tasted so good. I highly recommend this. I ordered the veal piccata and he ordered the bolognese with a stuffed meatball on top! The bread and dipping sauce is excellent. The salad was unexpectedly delicious. Both of our meals were absolutely delicious! We had so much food to take home and we got some tiramisu to take home with us. Our server Clinton was really awesome. He was attentive and had a great personality. They also have valet for 6 bucks- well worth it! Basically, you NEED to eat here, you will not regret it. Can't wait to go back!",

The server just cleared my salad without asking if I was done and plenty was in my  bowl . Also I saw other birthday cupcakes go out did they not check the reservation? I did not receive one, not to sound childish.  I had the seafood Divola and the lobster was tough, however the rest of the seafood and sauce was good . My husband had the veal chop pizzaiola and he thought it was ok, excellent portion size however .  Overall I think the restaurant is overpriced and I would not say the taste of the food was exquisite.  Visited 2/28.",

This is traditional Itaiian at its finest. Hearty sauces, fresh meats, exquisite flavor.   To kick things off- amazing oils, a cheese marmalade and HOT bread.   The Meatball was excellent. Note I said Meatball, as this is one ball bigger than your fist. Stuffed with cheese, served in an amazing tomato sauce and topped with fresh parmesan. And this was just the appetizer  Next up was the Veal scallopini Tarfuto, which is served with onions. But before that arrived, first comes an amazing walnut vinagrette salad then a fresh pasta in vodka sauce. Both to die for. Picture the pain I am in before I even get to the veal.   Then comes comes the veal. Succulent and melts in your mouth. No knife needed.  It goes without say I did finish a single plate, but what I did not finish served me well as breakfast the next morning! Round 2!  If in the area, I would highly recommend stopping by and being transported to a country far far away",

    "text": "What an amazing restaurant.  My husband took me here for my 50th birthday. We went here for our anniversary a year ago and said we would definitely come back. What a surprise, my husband made reservations for us for my big day. we were amazed at the new renovations. We were early and sat at the bar for a drink before dinner. We were greeted and checked in by a very nice employee. She directed us to the upstairs. As we were walking away, she stopped us and told us we need a picture for the special occasion. Everything was going so well. The bartender (I wish I got her name) was very nice and helpful. We were seated early for dinner. It was a wonderful surprise to get a photo of my husband and I. The last time we were here, they gave you a customized menu. This was a wonderful surprise, since my husband hates photos. So, thank you. But, this is when the night went down hill. We were seated on the second floor of the old section  Our waitress was kelly. She was not Alla Famiglia quality.   We got more attention from her helper,Kristie. Our main waitress took our order and never came back. The assistant did everything. I am appalled at the treatment we received from your  waitress. She never came over and asked if we needed anything. I am sorry but, when you pay good money. You need to be treated better. I had ordered a glass of wine with my dinner. Well,  since the assistant delivered our meals, there was no wine. I had to find her and ask for my wine. I really wish i wouldn't have left her a 20% tip. What started out as a wonderful night, really turned out disappointing. It only takes one bad waitress. You only turn 50 once, thanks Kelly and your dark haired waitress friend. You ruined my birthday. It is really sad that the service can ruin your dinner and experience.",

    "text": "Rating the overall experience we had here.  First off this is family style multi-course meal;  every main dish comes with a salad and pasta dish to share.  The salad is one of the best salads I remember eating and could easily be enough for an appetizer.  The pasta tossed in a vodka sauce was just ok.  The homemade pasta is not actually made in house (I asked), but it is 'fresh,' which I'm assuming meant bought from a store on the strip or a market district.  We had also ordered the calamari and the meatball appetizer because we were starving and that proved to be way too much food for a family of 5.  If you must get an appetizer, I highly recommend the meatball, you will not regret.  The veal chop is easily the best thing on the menu and where Alla Famiglia really shines.  From all the pasta plates and steaks and seafood dishes that were ordered at our table, the veal chop was by the unanimous favorite at our table.  Incredible flavors and tender cuts, but by the time you get to the main course, you're full with the bread, salad, and pasta that comes before you can't really enjoy it fully.  Most plates come with a side of their grilled veggies (which again were ok), but some dishes come with nothing so I would make sure to ask if you need a side.   So long story short, this is a marathon and don't expect to be done in an hour and a half.  Pace so you can really enjoy that veal chop at the end!  When you first walk in it seems very small, but there are back rooms and stairs that go up one or two floors.  There's also a back patio one floor up from ground floor.  It's tight sitting spaces, but very cute and authentically Italian.    So now that we established that the ambiance and food are pretty solid, the thing that earned this 3 stars is how we were hosted to our table.  We had a reservation at 7:30pm and were 30minutes early, which we recognize is nowhere near to our reservation time so we elected to grab drinks and sit on the patio.  When 7:30 comes around we inquire about our table only to be told that there was not a sitting space yet, which would be ok minus the fact that there were multiple tables open that we asked about.  7:45 we asked again and were told that they were setting up a table immediately.  8:10 comes around and we're still not seated so had to ask the hostess again, which apologized and sat us at the table we had asked about 40 minutes ago when our reservation time was.  It took 40 minutes to seat us at our table for our reservation time of 7:30 when there were tables open.  It was a frustrating experience because everyone was hungry and we weren't even offered bread sitting on their patio...  The frustration unfortunately set the mood for the dinner and although our food was great, we didn't really enjoy the time we had here.   We really wanted to love Alla Famiglia.  Perhaps we'll try one more time and hope our experience is better.",

The pasta is delicious, and the spicy oil they give you to pour on really adds an awesome zing of flavor. I had the filet for dinner, and it was cooked perfectly. The sauce was great as well.

This food needs and deserves service to match! The service was poor and the communication lacking. The appetizers were brought out before the bread!!! The three dishes for the bread were never explained until all the bread was gone .... not a big deal. But the two filet gorgonzola that came out and sat on the table for 10 minutes before the veal entree and last but not least.....the Pasta Bolognese  ...Yes that was last!  And the waitress had no answer to why 1/2 the tables food came out 10 minutes prior. When she asked if I wanted to speak to the Manager I explained \"no I just want to know why the meals were brought out individually\" she stated \"I don't know why\" when I did speak with the Manager I wasn't even allowed to explain the situation....constant interruptions .....and was never allowed to describe the situation.....GREAT FOOD !! HORRIBLE SERVICE AND MANAGER! Theresa was to busy hanging in the bar talking to other patrons at the bar.....who she didn't realize were with our group.",

A couple near us was in a hurry and I feel like they missed out on half the fun of dinner. But to each their own. I love a good coursed meal, absolutely love it. We started with the hand rolled mozzarella, which was fantastic. As was the white bean spread. The salad was fresh and crisp. My absolute favorite part of the meal though was the pasta with vodka sauce. I could write songs about this pasta dish. I'm telling you now the next time we return I will simply eat this pasta until I'm so full I could die a fat and happy death.  For our entrees Chris had the veal chop (holy mother this thing had to weigh 5 pounds! And it was PERFECTLY cooked). And I very much enjoyed the mahi. We did not even remotely save room for dessert. The best part ofall of this was that we had enough food to have a complete meal the next day for three people. The portions are THAT generous. But oh that pasta. My mouth waters just thinking about it!",

The Chef and his team execute at a very very high level.   Protip: I came in on a very slow moment. Early early dinner with some work people. We had the pleasure of talking to the Chef- as we were seated at the table just by the door, in close proximity to the kitchen (you'll get it when you get there). We liked the guy so much we handed the menus back to the server and told him to just bring us whatever the chef suggested.   The whole meal was amazing. But I will say this without any qualification. The next sentence is not at all taken lightly.   The smoked cheese app with truffle oil, arugula, and lemon was the best first bite of food I have ever had in my life, a life that has had a considerable amount of top contenders for bites.   Let that sink in. Go eat here.",

The atmosphere is warm and cozy and not stuffy at all, which is not often the case with \"fine dining.\"  I appreciated the home-like feeling and the framed Pens jerseys on the wall! I am becoming a Yinzer...  The bread and holy oil, chickpea dish, and goat cheese spread that they set the table with was amazingly good, and it only gets better.  All their meals come with a salad and a pasta dish with vodka sauce.  (I didn't see anything about fettucine in a cheese wheel, so maybe they don't do that anymore--not sure.)  I ordered seafood diavolo but could only finish about 1/3 of it, and my husband ordered a steak dish that he (amazingly) polished off.  He said it was the best steak he's had since we left Nebraska, so that's a pretty high compliment.  Yes, this place is expensive ($50-ish/entree), but you can DEFINITELY get at least two meals from one, and there is an option to share a dinner with a $15 charge for the extra pasta and salad dish, which may be the route I would take in the future since I'm a snacker and would rather have an appetizer as dinner anyway.  I think everyone in the 'burgh should try this place at least once, for a special occasion dinner because it's awesome!",

The charming location and open kitchen make it the perfect date night spot. Then there is the food - portions are large but you are getting old family recipes. Must have: meatball appetizer and pork chop Milanese. Come hungry and go home stuffed with left overs",

    "text": "We heard great things about Alla Famiglia and finally decided to give it a try.  We came here with another couple for my husband's birthday dinner.  I don't even know what to say.  It was, by far, all around one of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh.    They were undergoing renovations and we sat in the small front room which seemed a bit cramped and, at times, a bit cold as people came in and out of the establishment on a frigid December night.  That didn't detract from our experience, though.  The manager/owner (??) stopped by the table to greet us and to chat for a few minutes.  Everyone was friendly, welcoming, and very attentive to our needs.    The meal started with bread, oil, and toppings.  It was followed by one of the most delicious salad and pasta courses that I've had.  Since we reviewed the menu online before our visit, we were prepared for the high entree prices.  We weren't prepared for the size of the meals.  Usually in an upscale restaurant, one expects to pay big bucks for a very small meal, perhaps a steak the size of a hockey puck in the center of a nicely decorated plate.  But at Alla Famiglia, the dishes are so big that one can easily get 2, maybe 3 meals out of one entree order.  One person in our party ordered the veal chop and I swear it was as big as a dinner plate.  All of our meals were delicious.  As much as we wanted to order dessert, we just didn't have any room left in our very full bellies.  And we were smart enough to skip the appetizer.  I am looking forward to our next visit, at which time I think I will order a pasta dish if available and not one of the entrees.  Bread, salad, and pasta is all I need;  my idea of a perfect dinner.",

The staff that works there is knowledgeable about anything we asked about. We were quite impressed with every staff member we had interactions with. Now, onto the food... I do not have the words that could do the incredible meal we all had justice. From appetizers to entree  it was SUPERB!!! I can't wait to enjoy what I took home with me tomorrow.

It was thanks to Yelp we discovered it and what a discovery!!!!  Its been a couple months since I ate here so my memory of each course is a little foggy but, suffice it to say, that every single time I now crave Italian food, this restaurant is what comes to mind. I now live in Philly otherwise I would probably end up here every other week (which would hit hard on the wallet since its delicious but pricey).  It's a small place with a very romantic/intimate vibe and an authentic feel. The portions were generous and extremely tasted even better re-heated the next day (a rare thing).   The one thing I would advise is do not gorge on the bread! This will be very difficult to do as it is delicious, along with the oil it is served with but you will regret it because there will be a lot of food coming afterwards. The waiter warned us but we couldn't resist and barely had room for the delicious courses that followed.  This might be one of my all time favorite restaurants and I plan to come here again (most likely for an occasion that warrants the cost).",

    "text": "FACT: Thee best Italian meal I've had in the Burgh, hands down! FACT: I ate so much I thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher. FACT: It's a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood.  Need some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with \"Holy Oil,\" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life!   We ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place.   We also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!  For the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!  Fourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.  For the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.  Whenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here.   A perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!",

    "text": "Let me start out by saying that we rarely look to dining out for Italian food. We have found that to find quality Italian worthy of spending $$ outside of our own home has been difficult to find in the Burg. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of Italian restaurants out there, but none we would seek out for a special occasion, so to speak. We have always found the New York/New Jersey establishments more to our liking....until now.  Alla Famiglia is nestled in a not so nice of a neighborhood in the Burg called Allentown. Although we were never worried, but I could see how some may feel it is out of place in it's location. There is valet parking, so need to worry about your car while dining. Now once you are inside, you will soon forget where you are.  The inside is very small and there are 3 floors where you may be seated for your meal. On this occassion, we were seated on the third floor. Way up, climbing 3 flights of stairs can work up an appetite. Once on the 3rd level however, you can enjoy some of the religious artwork and beautiful stainglass featured throughout the dining area. There were 5 tables of various sizes and the bonus was the private restroom located nearby, so you did not have to manage the steps again until you were finished with your meal.   I would also like to mention that we were dining early and although the room was rather private at first, it became QUITE loud as the evening went on and other patrons were being seated. I also think the free flowing wine helped the noise levels as the night progressed. Needless to say, we had difficulty hearing one another towards the end of the meal.  There were 5 in our party and our server was very attentive throughout the night to make sure any requests or special customizations were welcomed and met. We started our meal with the complimentary bread, dipping oils, goat cheese spread and cheese medley brought to the table. We all agreed to share the famous 12 oz stuffed meatball which was enjoyed by everyone at the table. In fact, everyone was asking for more of the wonderful sauce to accompany thier bread.  Several items are served family style and come with any of the entrees that are ordered. We were then delivered and very tasty salad tossed with a light vinegarette which included olives, nuts and cranberries. Gorgonzola was brought on the side if desired. Then the pasta with vodka sauce made it's arrival. Several mentioned that they would have just ordered this if they knew how delicious it was. And this was just the beginning....  On came the entrees, several veal dishes were ordered, as it is their signature item on the menu. Although there were also many specials offered that night, everyone seemed to gear towards the classics. I ordered the veal marsala, which was delish! It was certainly one of the best I have had. One member of our dining party ordered the special pork chop offered that was huge! Another entree ordered was the filet mignon topped with lump crab meat and gorgonzola cream sauce. It literally melted in your mouth! I decided this would definitely be ordered on my next visit. All the food was cooked perfectly to order and scrumptious!  We were all pretty full but decided to share the Burnt almond tiramisu stuffed with raspberry for dessert. It was divine! I swear I heard the angels in the nearby painting sing as we devoured it!  As others had mentioned, it is a bit pricey, but for special occassions it is a must do. I felt it was quite worth every penny of our bill which was $306 for the party of 5. (We did BYOB) We have dined at much more expensive establishments and left unimpressed, which was not the case at all here.  The only negative was the long walk down the steps through the many other diners after too much wine. It can be challenging! So, watch your step! But do make a visit, you won't be disappointed!",

We loved everything that came to the table--the best calamari we've ever eaten, fabulous bread, the pasta Davoli and veal picatta.  The salad was also very nice.  It was fun to eat a multi-course dinner, and we were completely stuffed by the time our entrees arrived.  Who can resist a bowlful of freshly cooked pasta with that amazing vodka sauce?  We did manage to bring some home with us.    We ordered a very expensive pinot noir, which our waitress gladly decanted for us, after we asked her.  We each enjoyed a glass of white wine while we waited for the red to open up.    My only complaint has to do with our seating.  We were in the back room at a little table, and guests, servers, and waiters walked around us constantly.  No one every actually bumped us, but I felt on guard the entire time.  I could not relax.    It was a great dinner, but a very expensive dinner.  We decided we were glad we went, but won't go back.",

    "text": "My first experience at Alla Famiglia was, to say the least, disappointing. I have heard friends rave about this restaurant and I was eager to try it for the first time. Our reservations were for 10 guests at 7:30pm, and the occasion was a birthday celebration for dinner before going out to the clubs. A few of us who arrived early had a drink at the bar, and the bartender was quick and attentive. Sadly, this wasn't the story with our server upstairs once we were seated at the table. Immediately I noticed that he seemed to be unknowledgeable about the wines and drinks. We were ready to order appetizers once we all received our drinks (which took longer than expected) but our server was nowhere to be found. This became a pattern when it came to ordering refills on drinks, entrees, and getting our checks. 25 minutes for 3 glasses of wine at one point...really? The entrees were delicious and came out hot, so I doubt the kitchen it to blame for the slow service. Although, at 10:30 one guest had to leave and take his food togo...(3 hours into dinner). The worst part was when we had finished everything by 11:15 after our meals finally came out and we just wanted the checks so we could continue the night out on the town. We did not leave Alla Famiglia until after midnight. We never received separate checks like expected. We actually had to go down to the host stand and split the check evenly 9 ways and have THE HOST cash us out so we could go out before the clubs were closed. This was the opposite of the service I expected from a place that boasts to be a five star restaurant. I wish I could say the food was worth returning for, but not with such pathetic service.",

My favorite part is the kitchen in open to the dining room so the entire evening you get sensational, mouthed watering smells from all the dishes on the menu. The veal is my personal favorite but everything I've had there is spectacular. You can tell they use the best/freshest ingredients. It is a really special spot. It is perfect for special occasions. My mouth is watering writing this review. The tiramisu is also to die for - it is a little unconventional (raspberry almond) but it will not disappoint. I've lived in the city for 6 years now and this is still the best restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh. Oh yeah, and the service is incomparable. The servers will go above and beyond to accommodate any special requests and ask the kitchen to modify any dish (I.e. You don't want rosemary or want to add a protein, etc.) Make your reservation now!   (I also saw a review bashing the price and for the quality of food and drinks you will receive here the price is extremely reasonable. Most restaurants in Pittsburgh that claim to be of equal quality will charge the same or much more for sub-par food and service)",

But then the salad came out (delish), then the pasta (yumz), and then the main (dead). It was the veal with crab meat + seafood Diavolo. We ended with a cheesecake and my stomach was gonna explode but it was well worth it. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice restaurant.  I reside in LA and come here often and am glad I finally have a go to restaurant. I think I've been to all the \"good\" restaurants in Pittsburgh and this one blows everyone single one out of the water times 100.  The location is a bit out of the way but you can't get things you want the easy way in life so....take an Uber! The meal wasn't cheap for sure but a nice place for special occasions.",
