She got one of the salads and wasn't impressed. I got the tomato soup and half of a caprese sandwich. This place advertises its grilled cheese sandwiches, but they're not really grilled cheese sandwiches. It's almost like a sandwich in between two pieces of Texas Toast (which was hard & crunchy). The tomato soup was awful.   I do like that they have Arsenal cider on tap. I'd go just for that!",

    "text": "Meh - I wasn't impressed by much here.  A lot more lows than highs during our Saturday night dining experience.  We arrived and were told it would be about an hour wait for the two of us.  This was fine - we wanted to window shop.  We were added to the list and received the text message letting us know that we would be notified when our table is ready.  An hour passed and we didn't hear anything.  By this time, we were done window shopping and sitting by the fountain.  We noticed that there were several open tables in The Yard, so we walked upstairs to ask what was going on.  Hostess seemed very confused, as the lobby completely was cleared out, and there were at least 10 open tables by then.  We were not offered an apology, but were seated after we asked what was going on.  Second issue - it was so warm.  I'm always cold and I was sweating.  We placed our drink/food order immediately.  Food came out fast - one of the high points. However, our table did not have any silverware or napkins.  So we had to wait.  Food was OK - nothing to write home about.  We both ordered a grilled cheese sandwich - OK but extremely greasy.  Soup was good.  Chips were meh. Pountine was good.  Beer was great.  Awesome selection of beer.  At the end of the night, we had a decent time with OK food and great beer.  Then we got the bill.....Whoa! Expensive!  Not worth it.  Extremely disappointed with our experience.",

They also gave the kids crayons and placemats you can write on so very kid friendly. They serve great coffee! The server said it's Allegheny coffee. We were very pleased with everything except the food came out very quickly. We had just received our coffee and a minute later, our food was there. It wasn't bad for us because we have to eat quickly with 3 little kids but if I wasn't with kids, it would be way too quick. Not a big deal though and we'll definitely be back.",

Attractively decorated with the trending wood paneled wall with globe light decor, it has a nice beer selection.  This restaurant specializes in unique grilled cheese - I suppose it is an extension of the mac n cheese trend of 5 years ago.  There are a few restaurants locally in the South Hils that are trending in this direction.  Mac n Toz and Hello Bistro come to mind.  The Yard does not do grilled cheese well.  What they do is slap a piece of industrial cheese that doesn't melt on each side of a piece of Texas toast and put it under a heater.  They then grill the fillings separately and stuff them into the fake grilled cheese.  It's gross and most of the fillings are full of potatoes.  So many potatoes.  So much bread.  Fake not-melted plastic-looking cheese.  Not good.  Beer selection  - very good. Atmosphere - crowded.  The service was excellent.",

The restaurant sits directly above BRGR, which has to frost the owners there. The space looks pretty barebones and utilitarian... we sat at the bar & perused a menu of four dozen beers on tap. I don't get it. Doesn't every bar these days have a big selection of drafts? Even Primanti's across the street does. The specialty of the house is gourmet grilled cheese, which we ordered despite the fact that I once ordered a grilled cheese at a restaurant & my best friend said \"You are absolutely NOT ordering a grilled cheese. If you want a grilled cheese we will go home & I'll make you one.\" These were advertised as \"gourmet\" grilled cheese sandwiches and we found them to be fine, but not life changing. What wasn't fine was the tomato soup that seemed like that thick, gross, concentrated stuff with an odd chipotle taste added. The homemade potato chips were a salt lick and therefore absolutely inedible. The bartender was fantastic & the rest of the staff seemed nice as well.  I think we might try again sometime as there is maybe more interesting stuff on the menu. But only if those dopes at The Galleria fix the escalators.",

We tried to make a reservation ahead of time but they don't take reservations on the weekend. The wait for a table was 1 hour, which I can understand because it was 6:30pm on a Saturday, an obviously busy time. We got our table exactly 1 hour later. Our server wasn't bad but she was clearly in a rush and stressed out. We felt rushed the entire meal. The food came out pretty fast but was an absolute mess. Everything was insanely greasy and undercooked. The fries were basically raw potatos. The tomato soup was thick like oatmeal and not even edible. The only special request we gave was no mustard on one of the sandwiches. It came out covered in mustard. I just ate it because at this point we were just trying to get out of there. The bill came out.....$65 for 4 glorified grilled cheese sandwiches and drinks for 2 adults and 2 kids. Overpriced to say the least.  Two of us started feeling sick to our stomachs immediately after the meal. I can still feel the meal laying in my stomach as I'm writing this, 16 hours later.

We had the pleasure of sitting in a side room all to ourselves, it was significantly warmer in the room, but that didn't make or break our brunch. The staff was patient with us and very friendly despite there being so many of us. The brunch menu is to die for and everything sounds delicious, it makes ordering difficult - chicken and waffle sliders or snozberry pancakes?! Bottomless mimosas or a boozy coffee beverage?!

When they're menu is wrong and we take additional time to figure out our order they immediately move on and we don't see them again for ten minutes. Either make your menu accurate or make your bartenders responsive. As it is, everytime I come here I'm dissatisfied. I'd rather go to any bar but this one.",

One of the group ordered the sangria and reported that it was tasteless. 4 of us ordered sandwiches, one ordered a steak from the local menu. It took a very long time for our food to arrive, then we got 3 sandwiches and the steak. After we were halfway done the other sandwich arrived. I had the caprese, it wAs ok but somehow it was bland. I would try something else. Maybe it was first week problems, I'll go back, but the Yard was comparable to Primantis",

After drinking our beers, the waiter miraculously reported they now have Yard burgers?  Don't bother...chain restaurant FAIL",

And the food - I had the Blarney Stoner grilled cheese - was fantastic! The addition of the tomato soup is a perfect side, and I basically dipped everything on my plate in it. I'll be trying their take on a Cuban sandwich for my next visit. Very respectable beer menu as well, something for everyone. I haven't had the brunch menu items yet, either, but it's certainly a strong offering.",

Fiance got the poppin my collar shrimp sandwich. It came with 4 small shrimp and 1/4 stick of cream cheese slabbed right in the middle. On two 1\" pieces of Texas toast. Too creamy.   I got the always sunny steak sandwich which was close to great. The onions peppers and cheese were perfect. Absolutely perfect. However the flat iron steak was unseasoned and tough to bite off. Described on the menu like a Philly cheese I would expect it chopped or sliced. For 14 bucks the steak should get cooked to order.   Unless they can sub the Texas toast for a thinner ciabatta or softer brioche I would avoid the back side of the menu.",

    "text": "My wife and I had an early dinner at the Yard at the Galleria today.  The experience was acceptable but the food was borderline unacceptable.  We walked upstairs and were seated immediately where we asked to be seated because the place was completely empty.  I was torn between a signature grilled cheese sandwich and a burger, so ordered a Mission Impossible but asked for a regular burger instead of the veggie burger, and ordered a caesar salad on the side.   The waitress asked how I wanted the burger and I said medium.  My wife ordered a Big Che-bowski with tomato soup.  The waitress was attentive, but the food took 25 minutes to arrive at our table and besides a few folks at the bar, we were the only people seated.  My salad arrived and it consisted of lettuce, a couple of croutons and a bowl of caesar dressing on the side.  I'm kind of old school and the whole idea behind caesar salad at a restaurant is that the dressing is well blended into the salad.  That is, after all, part of what I'm paying for.  I could have gotten this salad at McDonalds.  I was hungry and once mixed, the salad was not bad.  Then the rest of the food arrived.  My wife's tomato soup was cold.  My \"grilled cheese\" sandwich was neither grilled nor very cheesy and the hamburger, if you could call it that, was horribly overcooked.  Shoe leather overcooked.  I was still hungry but I could not finish this thing.  To me, a grilled cheese sandwich, in spite of the added ingredients, should be GRILLED, preferably in butter, and oozing with cheese.  Niether of the grilled cheese \"specialties\" that we ordered fit this description.  They were the opposite of \"special\".   My sandwich was toasted, not grilled, and the small amount of (buffalo mozzerella and goat cheese, supposedly) cheese inside was dry and cold.  My wifes \"grilled cheese sandwich\" (cheddar, gouda, fried egg, bacon and tomato) was warm but only toasted on one side and the other side appeared to be either very lightly toasted or stale. Hard to tell.  She ended up taking it apart and eating the bacon and egg out of it.  Tell me, have you EVER been able to take a real grilled cheese sandwich apart?  The McDonalds analogy applies here as well.  Both of our sandwiches could have been wrapped in paper and served at McDonalds.  The food would have been hotter probably.  Not at all impressed.  The best part of this meal was the house-made chips. The chips were excellent and were worth about half a star in my rating.  The last little segment of this adventure was the bill.  Somebody gave my wife a $20 gift card, so I presented it with a credit card to pay the bill.  The meal, without drinks, came to $29.93.  Minus the $20 gift card, which was not shown on the bill, and the total was.....$9.86.  Wait.  What???   Granted, this was all very cheap, but even the waitress could not explain why the bill did not equal $9.93.  After being here for over an hour, I was not really in a mood to investigate further so we paid the bill and left.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend this place.  We will not be back.",

It didn't take long for my napkin to become smeared with grease from wiping off my hands when I ate my grilled cheese sandwich.  Every single member of my family felt a bit queasy after dinner.   Service was fantastic, and the environment was great. But unless you're used to greasy food, you might want to avoid this one. Instead, visit BRGR downstairs. Much better food.",

They have a large beer selection and a couple ciders on tap, which was nice, too. The service was wonderful and when we noticed we hadn't received part of what we ordered, they gave us extra to take home to make up for it (totally unnecessary). I'm shocked that they've been open less than a month an everything is already so good.   The cajun chips were a bit disappointing, since we thought they'd be spicier and even the ones where there was a ton of seasoning on top didn't have a kick. It also seems like they put the seasoning on after the chips have cooled (rather than having a place to make and store each kind of chip immediately), which meant the seasoning fell off easily. I'm still looking forward to trying the other chip options, but I hope they start seasoning them a bit better.",

    "text": "Very good gastropub in the Mt. Lebanon Galleria. There is a very large selection of prime quality craft beers. If you are a craft beer connoisseur, this place is a must.   If you come during happy hour from 4:30 to 6:30 all craft beer drafts are half off. This is the same discount you get at Primanti Bros across the street, but The Yard has a better selection.   There's a beer listed projected in the wall and also a paper list they can give you that organizes the beers by type and gives details of the ingredients and ABV.   The food is also very good and kind of unique with the grilled cheese specialty sandwiches. I really liked the Cheesy Capresey. It had various cheeses but the taste of the balsamic vinegar was prominent. Very interesting combination, and not overly cheesy. The tomato soup is a good accompaniment. The homemade chips were good but did not come straight out of the fryer--I thing they may have been sitting out.   The setting and layout is also excellent. You're at the top of the mall and as you sit at the bar you can see across the whole atrium and out the windows of the Galleria. It had a very open and spacious feel. The bar in the middle of the restaurant is large with a lot of seats and there are lots of tables spread out. Lots of screens around too and a good place if a game is on.   This place is highly recommended.",

    "text": "This place didn't disappoint!!!! Will absolutely be back again. We came knowing there would be a wait. It was a 45 minute wait, we added our names and they sent us a text to confirm we were on the list. We watched the time and walked around the galleria and got drinks elsewhere while waiting because the yards bar was packed and we couldn't even squeeze in to grab a drink to wait with. They should have an opening at the ends atleast for people to walk up and order a drink.   Shortly before our table was ready we headed to the yard and waited about 5 minutes. There is almost no seating in the waiting area. They should find a new place for the high chairs and add more seating in the waiting area. The bench barely fit 4 people on it. They called our name and we never got a text saying our table was ready, weird.   We were seated at a high top table near the bar. This was ok, but those tables have NO ROOM AT ALL. We could barely put a single thing on the table. I would have rather a slightly larger table so I was more comfortable.   The service was good and pretty quick. We each got ipa beers which were good, nothing crazy to rave about.   The menu is big! We were nervous we wouldn't be filled from a grilled cheese. We were so wrong! Very happy to say we were so stuffed, we absolutely slipped in to food comas after eating. I got the buffy the Mac attack slayer. This was a grilled cheese with Mac and buffalo chicken. It was so good! Can't wait to go back and order that same one again! I opted out of the chips that are included because I heard they're greasy and got the fries. They seem to be fresh cut fries. They were great!! You also get tomato soup with your meal. It was perfect for dipping your sandwich and fries in! It is thick and more like a tomato paste (which I normally hate, but it was very good)!! My fiance got the wac Arnold. It is almost like a Big Mac. The description is very deceiving though. They state it has two beef patties on it. You'd expect it to be a double stacked patty sandwich. It was not. It had two tiny little patties side by side. Very odd and he would have rather a stacked double patty sandwich. He said it was still very good and that he was full.   Overall, great place and packed! Will be back!",

It was a freezing cold day so what sounded the best to me was The Simple Jack. It was a 4 Cheese Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup and chips. The sandwich came out and the cheese was just oozing out of the sides. YUM. I cut the sandwich in half and picked up half to eat and the cheese stretched forever. MIND BLOWN. I fell in love in the first bite. The combination of the four cheeses was perfection. The thickness of the bread held up to the huge amount of cheese. Plus it was toasted to perfection.  The tomato soup has a great texture. It's not too watery or too thick. It has a lot of flavor that tends to lean toward a pasta sauce flavor. I liked that it wasn't your typical tomato soup.  I could have done without the chips. I love how thin they are but they hold the oil they are cooked in so that is what they tasted like. Next time I would either have them hold the chips or try the fries.  This lunch was total Comfort Food. Who doesn't love Comfort Food??",

I had the 'shrooms sandwich and my husband the buffalo chicken dip sandwich. I enjoyed the shrooms and recommend it to those wanting something different. The crust of the bread was very crispy which is my only complaint. Buffalo chicken dip is pretty spicy so avoid if you don't like that. Also, there was tons of it on the sandwich as you can see in my pic. Would come back. Definitely check it out if you like gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches.",

About 20 TV's above the bar and a few around the large open space in the top floor.  The arched walls/ceiling are black but with the large window and opening to the remainder of the Galleria, so it is very open.  The menu has some interesting combinations for cheese, meat, chicken, turkey or veggie with some interesting toppings.  My Dr. Dobak sandwich come on Texas toast thick bread with both provolone and cheddar cheese with a large amount of Short Rib, an Onion Rigs and Strawberry onion jam.  I really enjoyed my sandwich and the short rib but the strawberry jam made it a little sweeter than I expected.  The tomato soup that came with was good and the homemade potato chips are perfect.",

    "text": "Yay!! I am so so happy that The Yard is at the galleria!! The amazing location at the very top floor of the galleria has been the same restaurant for years and than was most recently vacant. I could not think of a better addition to The Galleria than The Yard.   I have also visited both locations in Shady Side & Market Square and had a great experience at those locations as well. Most recently, I came here for a Sunday brunch to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with my parents. My mom suggested making reservations- which surprised me.. but good thing we did! We had our reservations for 11:00 AM and the place was packed shortly after! I had the \"basically bottomless\" mimosas as my drink and Chris and my dad ordered the bloody Mary's- which they both agreed on being delicious.   Although we came here for brunch.. I can't come to The Yard and NOT order a grilled cheese. If you know me.. grilled cheese is one of my favorite foods. After much consideration, I decided on the Fried Green Tomatoes sandwich. This was served with homemade chips- and I got the garlic parmesan flavor on top. Everything was amazing! My mom also ordered a grilled cheese but stuck with the Simple Jack (boring!). Chris and my dad opted for breakfast foods- the Brun-Cho's Bro and Short Rib Delight. Both agreed that they were great meals- but almost a little too hearty! I see myself coming back to The Yard many times in the future!",

The restaurant is known for their cheese sandwiches and they don't disappoint.  However, may favorite is the steak salad.  It is huge, full of steak and fries and a fried egg.  The value is good and the service is very quick for a business lunch.  I have also been for both informal and large planned/catered happy hours.  The food and drink are great and happy hour specials are also competitive with other downtown spots.",

I went on a Friday night with a few co-workers. My friend used the Open Table app to make a reservation, which I highly suggest doing! We ate dinner, but mainly went for the drinks. There were a lot of beer options and some cocktails. For dinner, I had the Mother of Dragons sandwich. It was a grilled chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos and a chipotle ranch sauce. I loved it!!! I had their regular house chips (which there were many different seasonings I could have chose from) and substituted a Caesar salad for the tomato soup. We were there for close to 4 hours, drinking, eating and catching up, so it was nice to not be rushed out of there, even if it was busy. I would definitely go back to this location!",

Food is generous and unpretentious. Beer selection looks adequate, but I'm no expert there.  The fattoush salad is a fantastic vegetarian option. The rest of our group (meat eaters, every last one of them) humored me by trying the veg of the day - spicy cauliflower as an appetizer. The flavor was good, but honestly it was a little greasy.  I wish they had better takeout/leftover containers; we can't recycle the styrofoam (PS6) in our curbside. And we had to wait a long time for our check. But I guess that's better than being rushed. We will definitely be back.",

The fresh cut fries weren't greasy, the gravy was full of flavor, the cheese added creaminess and the beer cheese took it to a whole different level.   We also tried the heirloom tomato tartlets on their special menu and they were so good! They also were extremely flavorful with tomatoes, goat cheese and cranberries. It was sweet, salty and savory and the flavors complimented each other extremely well. They were delicate, light and beautiful.   I am a vegetarian and wanted to try something different, I got Yinz Guys Hungry? Without the sirloin. The sandwich itself didn't have much flavor, but I assume that's because I removed the meat. I got onion rings and fries as my sides and enjoyed both.   My bf got The Big Che-bowski and loved it. He prefers his bacon a bit more crispy than how it was served, but that's completely personal preference. He said even with that, it was absolutely fantastic and he would get it again. He had waffle sweet potato fries which were served with a cinnamon butter that was really fun and tater tots. Both of which were again really good.   We really enjoyed the food, but the service was incredible. The gentleman and woman who waited on us were attentive without being overbearing, knowledgeable, accommodating, helpful and professional. They genuinely treated us like family and friends which makes such a big difference.   We look forward to returning and trying different things!",

My suggestions:  - The Mac Attack is a good starting point if you're not sure about exotic grilled cheese sandwiches.   - I've have three or four other grilled cheeses and have never been disappointed.   - The salads are very fresh and crisp. The blackened chicken Caesar is a winner.   - The grilled chicken sandwich is good; haven't tried the burger yet (and may never until I sample more grilled cheeses).  Finally, I can say the servers are good. They balance a bar-crowd with the dining crowd, many times with young kids.

It was quite full, the bar was packed and there are plenty of tv's too. We started off with a couple drinks, the Liquid Encourage-Mint (tasted great but very low on the rum!) and a Blonde Walked into a Beer, a blend of 2 beers, orange bitters and honey syrup.  We started off with an order of the Poutine, as a Canadian girl this is something I can't resist. Nice big bowl of fresh cut fries covered in a stout gravy, not usually my favorite but this one was mild and I loved it. Lots of cheese curds that melted all over it and a side of beercheese (yuck, not my thing ) For our entrees we went with the Hail Caesar and the Dr. Dobak grilled cheeses. The Caesar tasted just as described, a Caesar salad turned into a grilled cheese sandwich. I will say the chickened did not taste blackened to me, but nevertheless it was tasty and tender. I loved dipping this sandwich into the tomato soup...a perfect match! The Dr. Dobak was stuffed full of tender and juicy short rib meat and cheese. Overall it was a great meal, not cheap by any means, but good food and good service are worth a nice weekend meal.",

I got the Cho-bowski, supposedly one of their top sandwiches.  It came on plain white bread that was barely buttered much less grilled.  The \"cheese\" was a handful of shredded cheese that had been overcooked (maybe even microwaved?) onto the bread. The tomato slice was horrible thin and added nothing to the sandwich.  Overall it was dry, tasteless, and boring. It was also a waste of money at $12.  The homemade chips were overcooked and flavorless and the tomato soup was less than tasteless. The only good thing about our experience was the waitress.",

Every time I have been here, around 5-6 times since we live close, it is ridiculously slow for average fatty as heck bar food and they charge $10.99 for a lb of wings, which is about 8-9 wings, weasel move, if charging $11 give a goddam dozen ---- boys who owns this are cheapskates.  Concept with TVs and beer options I get, but the wings are WAY over priced and takes 20 minutes to get a freaking beer or even a bartender (which there is max 2 and usually 1 staffed) to acknowledge you when only 35% of the restaurant is filled up, which is almost every time I been there.  What would it be if they actually had 2/3 of restaurant filled - pathetic!  Owners are all about the buck with their slim as heck staff to save a dollar and over priced small wings and charge $11 by the lb - are you serious???",

    "text": "Be prepared to stuff yourself. We were excited to try The Yard at the Galleria. We arrived on a Sunday evening and they had a 20 minute wait which was fine because they have an area for you to sit and order drinks & appetizers (aside from the bar).   The atmosphere inside is super cool. An industrial yet inviting feel. I would love to come back here for Happy Hour during a Pens game to watch on one of their many TVs. Every server in the restaurant was amazing as well! Very helpful and friendly. I would give 5 stars if I could stop here.  We had an appetizer of Buffalo Chip Dip which was delicious and a great portion. You can get pita or chips. It's a little spicy, but we like that!  Now onto the main dish. Obviously we all got grilled cheeses because that is what we are here for! Each grilled cheese comes with tomato soup and a side (potato chips,  fresh fries, Mac n cheese, tater tots, onion rings). It is cool because you have different seasoning options for the sides too. We each got a different side and they were so good! My Mac n cheese was amazing.  However, the Grilled Cheeses were unfortunately not good. Mine had 3 layers of cheese and was just a hard brick of cheese. The bread was greasy and made my stomach hurt immediately. The sandwiches were just too large to even be able to enjoy. If you are into greasy, messy, hard sandwiches, then you will enjoy this. I will say they have a TON of different options for Grilled Cheeses with chicken, pork, and vegetarian. The tomato soup also lacked flavor and was not thick enough for me.  Honestly if this was not a grilled cheese joint I would give 4, maybe even 5 stars. But I cannot get over how unappetizing all 4 of our grilled cheeses were. I will definitely be back for the atmosphere, service and apps. However, I do not see myself trying a Grilled Cheese again.",

I would've gotten one of the many gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches (for which the restaurant is known), but I had my eyes on the pulled pork flatbread when I looked up the menu online. It was incredible. Great portion of meat, cheese, onions/jalapenos, and barbecues sauce. It was really neatly contained as well! My husband got the grilled cheese with buffalo chicken and mac n cheese. I had a few bites, and it also did not disappoint! Very flavorful and a great portion size. His was a little more messy than mine though. The grilled cheese sandwiches are served with a small side of tomato soup (tasted a bit like marinara sauce, would've been yummy with some plain grilled cheese or Texas toast) and house made chips.   We will definitely be back to try more!  Ps we also liked The Yard much more than The Melt (similar type of grilled cheese place in Cleveland) in terms of both food and service!",

    "text": "I met a friend for lunch today at a place called The Yard in the Galleria. It's advertised as an American Gastropub. Plenty of beers on tap and many of them local.  I am awful when it comes to picking from a menu. Often times, I will stare at it a day or two in advance just to narrow down the choices to only a few. Having no time to look at it ahead of time, I had to pick something on the fly. With some assistance from our amazing bartender/server, Hilary, I noticed the Impossible Burger and chose it.  I'm generally a 'meat & potatoes' kind of guy, so anything strictly vegetarian is basically a non-starter. After reading about Beyond Meat / Impossible Burger on Reddit the day before, I decided to give it a go. When in Rome, right? While there's a noticeable difference between beef and the impossible burger (IB), I gotta admit that the IB is pretty tasty. A little A-1 might go a long way as a condiment, but I'm sure that's just a personal preference on my part. There was absolutely nothing wrong with it as-is. Nine out of ten times, I would pick a regular burger over something like the IB, but I definitely recommend that anyone try it at least once.  The beers were good and the service impeccable. Hilary was a top-notch and knowledgeable guide to both the beer & food menus. I don't get down to the Galleria often, but I look forward to making a trip up to the very top floor to dine there again.

After a friend recommended the Yard due to the private room, I sent an email via the website. Chuck was quick to respond and was extremely easy to work with. He answered all of my questions and made the process a breeze. He assisted in putting together a set menu and even printed them out for the day of the event.   The shower was on a Sunday midday - I arrived an hour early to set up and decorate and the staff was friendly and assisted with the little details. Our server was amazing and made sure we always had food, water, drinks and plates. The vibe with wooden decor worked perfect with our theme and there was music enough to be festive but not so loud you couldn't hear.   All of the food that came out was great! Everyone raves about the mac and cheese ball appetizer and all of the flatbreads were phenomenal. For main entree I had the mother of dragons grilled cheese with tomato soup and it was beyond amazing. Others has the Pittsburgh salad (which was Huge!) sunny in Philadelphia grilled cheese and cheesy capreesy grilled cheese. Most took boxes to go.  The drinks were not shy on liquor. This place does not skimp On ingredients from either the bar or kitchen. I would definitely return for brunch or dinner next time I'm in town and if you're planning an event The Yard should be a top contender!",

They occupy the top floor of the Galleria shopping center near the junction of Connor and Washington Roads.  I had some time to kill before my hair apt so I stopped over here to grab a bite to eat. While they are known for various grilled cheeses and drafts they had a good selection of salads and burgers to choose from. I was seated fairly quickly. My waitress took time out to explain the menu to me. I ordered the bison burger but I was a little concerned about the spicy sauce that comes with it. She was nice enough to put it on the side for me. Your utensils and napkins are in a holder in the center of your table so there's plenty for all my needs. The bar area is in the center of the restaurant.  All sandwiches come strictly with chips. You can for a slight upcharge swap those out for fries, coleslaw or even the vegetable of the day. Today it was buttered asparagus. They also have a soup of the day. Today was chili and I really wasn't in the mood for another salad to go with it.  I got my food within a reasonable amount of time. My bison burger came with the usual lettuce, tomato, etc toppings and was indeed a thick cut. It was very good and very filling. I also enjoyed the asparagus which is one of my favorite vegetable and the melted butter that was poured over it was a nice touch.  This place has their own rest room and if it is too difficult to climb stairs they have an elevator which will take you to the main floor. You can park anywhere both inside or outside the Galleria to come here.  I was very pleased with my visit and am looking forward to returning to try out their other offerings.",

    "text": "If you like grilled cheese sandwiches and you're in the mood for a splurge, The Yard is the place to go! I'm a big fan of their downtown location, so I was excited when they announced they would be opening a new set of doors in the South Hills as well.  I (and my family) have eaten here several times since it opened, and we always love it. Service is good and the food is fantastic! The last time I was here, a friend and I enjoyed a delicious brunch on a busy Sunday. Busy it may have been, but our waiter checked on us often and we were never left wanting.   My friend ordered the Big Che-Bowski sandwich (which includes two cheeses, over-easy egg, bacon, and tomato) while I ordered the Snozzberry Pancakes (topped with Strawberry & Blueberry syrup and ricotta whipped cream). Both were nothing short of amazing. His sandwich was the kind of messy but appetizing grilled cheese that you savor with every bite, while my three sweet and tasty thick flapjacks had me smiling with every bite. Also, half of the stack had to come home with me, because it was MASSIVE.  Good portions, good service, great food - it's everything I could ask for. That's why I always look forward to visiting The Yard!",

    "text": "I went for brunch with a few friends from college as a little reunion. It was such a nice spot to catch up with friends, had a great beer selection and brunch menu. However, service was extremely slow. We weren't in a rush so it didn't bother us any, but if we weren't having a reunion I think it would have felt like forever. Everyone did enjoy their meal! I would give this place another shot as it could have been a 5 Star if I didn't have to wait over an hour for a burger. However, the best part (of course I didn't take a picture) was the Bloody Mary. It was served with enough garnishes to share as an appetizer! It was piled high with a mini grilled cheese bite, candied bacon, celery, pickles, olives, and peppers. Everyone was very happy with their drink!",

    "text": "I had such an excellent experience at the yard in the galleria! I came here on a busy Friday night around 6 with a couple of friends expecting to have a bit of a wait. Wrong! We were seated immediately and soon after our waiter, Anthony L came over to grab our drinks. He was so pleasant and friendly! He swiftly came back with our drinks and we put in our food order. Maybe 10 minutes later our food came out and everything was right! I got the Blackened Chicken Caesar Salad and it was great! The chicken was cooked perfectly. I'm always a little iffy with chicken but this was amazing! There was just enough of everything in the salad.  We were in and out within an hour & I was so thoroughly impressed with this visit! Everything from the quick service, great waiter, and awesome food, the Yard earned my 5 stars!",

    "text": "Went for a weeknight to try out the new location. It's inside the Galleria mall, where there's a good section of parking above and tons of parking in the garage below. This is located at the tippy top of the mall so you either have to walk up a set of stairs or if you have a wheelchair/etc, there's an elevator that I think you have to take from the bottom floor? To be honest it's a little tough to find your way up to the restaurant if you aren't able to walk up the stairs.   My friend and I got some cocktails and poutine tots to share.  The tots were fried perfectly & the gravy and melted cheese were delicious! The beer cheese on the side, however tasted chalky and yucky.  The inside is open and airy and very industrial. There are standard tables and also the high tops near the bar (which I hate- where am I going to put my purse??)  I will definitely be back to watch a hockey game and eat, or have a nice lunch before catching a movie at the theatre right outside the restaurant.",

    "text": "We stopped in the Yard over Thanksgiving break with family. My parents were excited to bring us in since someone we went to grade school with is one of the owners. I have to say it's quite a great concept.  Grilled cheese, comfort food, sports, great service and beers galore! Our server, Wayne, was just fantastic and he explained to us that he's been around for almost all of the openings of the Yard. Their service was great - we saw about 5-7 different people throughout the meal refilling our drinks or clearing plates. Usually, you always have to wait for your server, but it was a very good team approach to their service model.  Since it was our first time in, we figured we had to try the grilled cheese, but they have other items then grilled cheese! The menu items had rather creative names too! I had the \"Big Che-bowski\" on gluten free bread. Couldn't have been happier that they had gluten free bread. We also started with the buffalo chicken dip with the creative name \"I dip, you dip, we dip\". The chicken dip was served with corn tortillas too. The staff was knowledgeable or will ling to find out which items were safe for gluten free people and which were not.  The grilled cheese comes with two sides, and there's a variety of items that you can upgrade to for a small charge. My husband had the mac and cheese and said it was just as amazing as others had told us.  Can't wait to go back!",

The side dish of brussel sprouts was $4 and contained only 3 brussel sprouts, the rest was all burnt flakes. After delivering our check, the server didn't come back and we had to ask another server if we were supposed to pay at the hostess stand and she took our check for us. Before tip $35 for a disappointing lunch.",

    "text": "Had wanted to try this place out for a very long time and finally got the chance this past weekend.  The place looks great on the inside.  We were here for dinner, but it would definitely be a fun happy hour spot.  The service was great throughout the night as well.  We ordered the buffalo chicken dip as an appetizer and it was very good.  However, for future visits I do not think I would get an appetizer because the main course portions are huge.  My sandwich was called Buffy the mac slayer.  Buffalo chicken with mac and cheese.  Sometimes a sandwich with mac and cheese can turn into a mess quick, however the quality bread they used help it stay together and made for a delicious sandwich.  The home cut fries with their house made ranch were also very good.  You can have your fries topped with different seasonings, I went with Cajun and it was perfect.  I also really liked their tomatoe soup.  My wife had a standard mac and cheese which she thought was pretty good.  My mom had the frank the tank, which was buffalo chicken dip, cheese, and an onion ring.  She wasn't a huge fan, but I thought it was great.  My dad had the wang Chung which is bbq pulled chicken and Asian slaw.  This was probably everyone's least favorite sandwich.  Overall I was very happy with the trip and will definitely be returning to try more of their sandwiches.",

The waiters were kind, talkative, and attentive, even on a super busy night. As for the food, I ordered the snozberry pancakes and they were delicious! They were huge and I even took some home to share. The waiter gave me two different syrups to try, one was plain and one was maple bacon (yum). As for dinner, I ordered the buffalo mac and cheese sandwich and it was also amazing. They have a great drink selection to choose from as well. I ordered a raspberry cider and will definitely be going back for more :)  I can say that on a weekend, use the open table app to make a reservation since it gets busy, or you will be waiting a very long time.",
