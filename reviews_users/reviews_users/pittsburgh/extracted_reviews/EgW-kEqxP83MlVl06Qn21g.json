One of the manager's was yelling at a woman who was trying to to reason with him about an incident that happened a while back. All of the staff were very emphatic and willing to give it another shot but what I witnessed came right out of the stone age. Degrading and  embarrassing to the woman if front of everyone. Not a professional move for someone in charge. Especially this time of year when good will and caring should be in our thoughts. This so called professional apparently enjoyed the power he thinks he possesses but to me he seemed to be a little man that enjoys playing the tough guy. The episode in question I found out later involved a 74 year old man. Always easy to push around our senior citizens but he will walk that walk someday and I hope someone will treat him better than he treats his patrons. Needless to say I won't be back. Watch out folks!",

    "text": "I've been here several times now, on my own.  Parking lot size is very good; I've never had trouble finding a space even when the place is crowded.  The bar and dining areas are separate, nice for folks who don't really want to be in a bar.  The restaurant area is rather small, however, maybe 10 to 12 tables, and it usually seems to be pretty well filled up, although I've always been able to get a booth.  And only because I've always found a booth, I've never sat in the bar area, only went in to look around.  It's a BIG bar area with a nice open feel to it and lots of seating, both at the bar itself and at tables placed all around.  It has a very friendly feel to it, and I'm guessing it gets pretty full during sporting events {GO PENS!}, wing nights and such.  The food...The first time I came here I was jonesing for a good burger, and boy, did I get one!!  Good to the point that it's what I've ordered every time since!  I actually ordered the platter, which comes with fries and housemade coleslaw and is of course, and rightly so, a few dollars more.  Now, the burgers listed weren't completely what I wanted, so I customized just a bit , going with a bacon cheeseburger {bacon VERY crisp} and lots of grilled onions.  My order was a little slow in arriving, but clearly it was because the place was busy on both sides.  And, believe me, each time I've been there, those servers MOVE!  Anyway, when the food arrived, the burger and fries were hot, the slaw nice and cold.  And everything was wonderful!  The burger was cooked exactly the way I'd ordered it {medium-well} and was nice and juicy.  The bacon was indeed beautifully crisp.  There was lots of melty, melty cheese, and the onions were grilled to perfection.  The fries were...not seasoned, exactly, but with something that made them perfectly crisp. And the slaw, which actually looks to be tiny chunks rather than shreds, was creamy and tangy.  My bill, which also included a Diet Coke, came to $10.06, which I feel is phenomenal for the taste, quality, and size {I had to take more than half the burger and half the slaw home!} of my meal!  They also have daily specials which sound awesome, but sadly, I've not gotten to any of those yet due to my burger crush!  I say this about very, very few restaurants, but this is ABSOLUTELY a place for which I'll drive out of my way!!",

The service is always good, the food is really really good, and our check at the end of the meal is always surprisingly lower than we expected.  Hands down, this place has the best steak salads in the the 'burgh (possibly my favorite EVER).  We've tried the burgers, and they've all been great.  The RIbeye was really good.  The wings also are good.  There's a nice big deck out back, and it seems to do good business in the evenings as a sports bar type place.  They frequently advertise live bands, though we haven't been out to check these out yet.  Overall, one of my favorite local spots - it's always the first place we take our out-of-town friends when they drop by.",

I have to say that the food was better than I had expect and the service was as good as I could have wanted. I would guess that for the dining room there was only one server and she quickly got busy because the place was packed by the time we left around 6:00pm. Our service didn't suffer but others may have as we already had our food. I had a Reuben which was a pretty good Reuben and was satisfied. The portion size was a little on the large side and I almost me and my lady would have shared fried as opposed to ordering an order each. I would go back and think that this place does a nice job for bar/lunch fare.",

We sat down and in a couple of minutes a waitress with multi-colored hair informed us if we wanted dinner (it is a restaurant right?)???? then we would have to wait at least 50 minutes for any food from the kitchen! She made it clear she didn't want our business; she said the kitchen was backed up because they expanded their patio section and the kitchen can't keep up? We understood but she offered to not take a drink; I guess assuming we were going to leave.  We waited a few minutes and when it was clear NOBODY was going to wait on us we walked out. We have visited MULTIPLE times before and have NEVER been treated in such a manner! I realize it is also a bar but as my teen son said - when he looked around ALL but ONE table already had their food???  My suggestion is to go to Sir Pizza around the corner or to Sunny Jim's on Camp Horne - we went to Sunny Jim's and they were VERY glad to wait on us and take our $$$$.  Shame on Hardwood Grille for treating customers in such a manner. Customers are what makes a business work but they clearly didn't want any last night!",

A bartender \"accosted\" us in the Lyft car .... he threw the tip at one of the passengers and said \"don't  come back\" and slammed the door.  The driver was shocked that her car was treated that way.  WTF?  They got the tip they deserved and didn't like it. Upon calling the management  we were  informed that\" they valued their staff and they had cameras in the parking lot\", great. Hmm perhaps they should value their staff by paying them instead of expecting we, the public, to do so.  Maybe I missed something... isn't a tip voluntary based on service?   When did it become expected in order to supplement low wages paid by employers?",

Then, it's a fight for an available table, whether it be clean or dirty from previous customers that you hope to find someone able to clean it off for you. Granted we went on a Saturday night during a Pens game, perhaps a week night would be less chaotic, but overall seemed to be a middle-age washed up hangout with horrible ambience and acoustics. The icing on the cake of the \"experience\" was ordering our food, waiting 50 MINUTES for our waitress to finally come back around only to say they accidentally lost our order slip and would have to start all over. A completely unacceptable, horrible, terrible experience. And lastly, be prepared to walk through a smoke stack of smokers directly outside the front door to get in and out of the dump.

The meals were brought out sparatically, but within another half hour we all had our food. One of the baked fish dinners was raw, as well as two of the burgers. Those items were sent back. There was also a fish dinner, so loaded with odd spices, and the waitress told us...\"people either love it or hate it\"! That was sent back as well. We continued eating. My husband went to get the waitress to get our birthday cake and was told that they never want us to come back!  I was very surprised because clearly, this food wasn't cooked correctly. Baked fish and child's burgers should be cooked thoroughly. This is a heath issue!  We continued to have our birthday cake and paid our tabs (including 20% gratuity). As we were leaving, a family member sarcastically said she enjoyed her food. That's when the owner told her to get the \"f\" out \"C#*@! and shoved her. A mob of waitresses and bar regulars joined him and were shouting and throwing punches! It was the craziest thing! Thankfully the police came right away.  I then heard the waitress tell the police that we were told to leave, but refused! I caught her in the lie and said \"You told us to not come back, You never said we had to leave!\" The police had everyone disperse.  If food gets sent back, then you should see if it is made wrong, not just assume it's the customer being a jerk. Lesson learned. We won't be back!",

    "text": "Never in my life have I ever felt more unwelcomed in a restaurant.  We went on a Monday shortly before lunch rush.  The host had his back to the door and was folding napkins/ prepping silverware.  When he eventually noticed us, he sassily told us we could sit wherever we wanted.  Sorry for interrupting your silverware prep, bro...   The menu was fairly large and somewhat diverse.  I was relieved to see that the gentleman who seated us was not our waiter.  Instead, the bartender was in charge of our table.  My relief was short lived, as while we were attempting to order, the host began to talk over me and hold a dish of creamer for my coffee such that I had to lean around his arm to finish speaking to the waitress.  On his way back to his precious silverware/napkin folding station, the host slammed into the back of my chair, knocking my purse to the ground without hesitation or apology.  It was in no way a tight squeeze.  We were at the very end of the seating area so there wasn't a table behind us-- probably 8+ feet of clearance between me and the wall.     Once we got our food, we were left to our own devices.  My fajitas were pretty good; definitely not high quality ingredients (the texture of the lettuce told me it'd been sitting out for a while uncovered), but pretty tasty nonetheless.  The waitress/bartender brought us our check in a reasonable matter of time, but took forever to come pick it back up, which was understandable since she was covering so much real estate.  Overall, I'd say this is a pretty standard dive bar with tons of untapped potential.  Nothing about it would compel me to write a Yelp review, but that host has my blood boiling.    To Rochester Inn Management: If you are interested in figuring out who this was, it was 11/7/16 at about 11:30AM.  EDIT: Please check out the reviews in the \"Not Recommended\" section.  You'll see a lot of remarks confirming that I wasn't the only one treated like garbage here.",

    "text": "I have not had a meal at this place I have only visited the bar twice On my first visit to be safe I ordered Heineken beer in the bottle the taste was authentic as it should be since there is no way to  open the bottle and water down the drink. Today I stopped by and ordered a Coors light draft it was as it should be, so I decided to order a shot of Tequila. Reposado was my preference. There were two bar maids on duty not sure of their names one was tall the other was short. The tall one asked the short one if they had any Reposado she said no they had 1800. She did not know that 1800 is the year tequila was first aged in oak cask and Reposado is one of the varieties of Tequila e.g. 1800 Silver (Blanco), 1800 Reserva Anejo, and of course 1800 Reserva Reposado that has a golden hue and the taste is a good balance between the Agave and wood flavors.  The drink that I received did not have a golden hue at all it was almost clear and you could not taste any Agave. The drink literally had no kick at all. I mentioned this to the bar maid's the short one became very defensive almost to point of being angry she insisted they did not water down drinks. I told her that I have been drinking for many years and I know what I am drinking I tried to explain that if Rochester Inn did not water it down it was done at the distribution center. I used to have a friend who was a liquor salesman and I know from first hand information this is a common practice it's what's called bar liquor The tall one offered to give me the drink for free which was nice of her but I insisted on paying full price for it and told her I just would not order it any more.  My whole point is I been all over the USA and some other places as well and I have always drank top shelf.  I have a seasoned pallet not only for alcohol but food as well and that drink did not cut it. To bad I just wanted a decent drink and was willing to pay whatever it cost but I wanted what I was paying for. It might not be a bad idea if the Inn invested in mixology school for their bartenders not every customer wants to drink beer or maybe that why they do because they know the drink will not be what it is suppose to be",

There was only one waitress for 29 people. There was no way one waitress could do an excellent job with that many people. The food didn't take very long to come once we all ordered but for us to sit there for so long before waitress took our orders, was unacceptable. People getting antsy. I have been there many times before this so I went to bar to get free popcorn and others followed. Granted, seven additional people came when reservation was 22 but even at 22 people, another waitress should have been added especially to take all the orders. We were the party in the back room so why didn't the waitress start taking our orders much, much sooner than she did for us to eat so late. Because of this, a few had to leave before they could even order. They never expected to be at lunch so long.",

    "text": "I ate here this past Tuesday evening with my father.  We came here at around 4:15 for an early dinner as my dad had to make it out to his bowling league later in the evening.  The setup of the place is that they have different entrances for both the bar and the dining room even though they seem to link up in the middle.  I do like the idea though as it makes it easier for the servers to notice you.  In the restaurant side there were a bunch of tables and booths and TV's that could be seen by each and every seat.  Whenever we walked into the restaurant side of the building there were only about 3 other tables eating.   Since we were eating early I decided to go a bit lighter and get the Chicken Caesar salad while my dad ordered the Fried Fish dinner.  My salad came out and I can't say that it was anything special, nor that it was bad.  It had your normal grilled chicken breast on top of romaine lettuce with cheese and Caesar dressing and was an average portion size.  None of the flavors stood out which helped to make it sort of a blah meal for myself.  My dad did enjoy his fried fish with vegetables and fries and he finished all of it although he also thought that it was nothing special.  The bottom line for me is that I probably will not be heading back here in the future.  While there is nothing wrong with the place, the food is just average and I feel like I can get much better food for a better price elsewhere.",

The waitress came pretty quickly and immediately informed us that a large group had just arrived and the kitchen was backed up, so we should place our order quickly. Since we could practically see the entire dining areas, we were unable to see the large group......  In addition, we were told that it would take an hour for our food to be prepared. Grilled items would take longer, fried food might be quicker.  Hearing that, we quickly placed our beverage and appetizer order and when she returned with the drinks we ordered our entrees. We did wait an hour and some food was brought out while some appeared much later. Never got the appetizer.  Since we were forewarned and felt pressured, we mostly stuck with the fried food. The wings are good. Do not order the Three Cheese Wrap unless you really like American cheese a lot.  Unfortunately, all restaurants in the Pittsburgh area are suffering greatly from the lack of good help thus making dining out very inconsistent.",

We waited close to an hour for our food....my sweet potato fries were totally COLD so I promptly told the waitress. The waitress couldn't be found for drink refills or to find out where my hot fries were so I had just the burger for dinner.  When we asked for the check, I said \"Don't forget to remove the fries!\"  She simply replied Ok, and went about her hurried way.  When she brought the check she basically dropped it on the table as she flew by...and did the same thing when she picked it up and when she returned our card.  Never a word...ZERO eye contact, not a Thank You or anything, and of course no mention of the mysterious sweet potato fries....  I made sure to leave a small note about the fries along with the appropriate tip. We at least had a good laugh about the poor service.   Apparently the owners feel the place is busy enough they don't need to worry about being properly staffed....wait staff and kitchen.  Maybe they need to add on to the kitchen instead of continuously expanding their parking lot. Or remove the window to the kitchen so the cooks can concentrate on my hot fries instead of people watching all night. Lol.  Sooner than later all of their customers WILL receive poor service at some point and all they'll have left will be the bar patrons. At least the beer will be as cold as the fries!!!",

The food is great and they always have something going on, whether it is a live band playing, bingo night, etc. They have great food and drink specials and also have a private room you can rent for events!

To be honest, I haven't been there in a few years, so I went into the restaurant with an open mind.   To start, I ordered the potato soup. It was very good. It was a cold rainy day, so this soup warmed me right up.   For apps, we tried the pretzels and the wings. Both were good. We would definitely order them again.   For my entree, I ordered the Reuben. It's one of the best Reubens I've had In Pittsburgh. It is literally so good.   The service was very good considering their kitchen is tiny. It might take a little longer for your food, but it's worth it!   Rochester Inn has a great special every day & they have great live music on the weekends.   You gotta check it out!",

Funny thing is, the dumplings kind of looked like cauliflower when I looked at it.  I had the fish on a dish with a baked potato.  Fish needed more seasoning and it was a very small portion so I was a little disappointed in that.  Husband had the Delmonico steak which he said was ok but needed steak sauce.  If you can make a fantastic steak you shouldn't need steak sauce.  Bread pudding for dessert was fantastic !",

There are tons of large TVs in the bar area and the penguins were playing the night I was there. On Saturday night they have a steak special. This Saturday was an 8 ounce tenderloin with two sides. I'm not sure if the type of steak changes because the special board just says steak special. My only complaint was I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out well done. I sent it back and the second one was done perfectly. When the bill came I expected the waitress to comp one of my beers to make up for the very badly cooked steak. She didn't so I didn't tip her and left a note. Despite this, I would definitely return as everything else was excellent. The service was good also despite the place being packed. There was also a band setting up for live music!",

I questioned our server hope there was no adjustments when we waited so long and was met with aggravation from our server,how nobody told us how it goes. Huh- when I asked what that meant I was given some explanation about how you just seat yourself, and the server walked away.

I would highly suggest going to other local bars like Hal's.. they would never promote girls being harassed. Would give a negative rating if that was an option!",

When the food arrived, my meal was not what I ordered.  I asked them to box the incorrect meal since I didn't want it.  They offered to get me some soup or salad but didn't offer to get me the correct food.  Really?  After waiting for almost 2hrs the best they could do was offer soup and salad?  It was extremely busy.  They were obviously working hard.  Notification of the long wait for food would have been appreciated and would have allowed us to leave to find another restaurant.   There were many disgruntled patrons around us.  Why wasn't anyone told when they first came in about the long wait for food?  Most people would understand and appreciate the notice so they could decide whether to wait or leave. With warning, we would have left to find food elsewhere and plans to return another time.  We eat at Rochester Inn often and would have understood.   Being allowed to sit so long with no explanation left us frustrated and unlikely to return. Receiving the wrong meal just topped off an already frustrating visit.",

    "text": "We've been meaning to get here for some time based on some personal recommendations from our friends. We stopped by on a Friday night and were taken aback on how full the parking lot was (a good sign to start). The restaurant and bar area were pretty full, and we decided on the bar area since there wasn't a wait. We later regretted this decision as it was incredibly loud and we were chased out by the band that was setting up and clustering the area around us with equipment.  I'm going to chalk up our visit as \"I probably didn't order what I should have.\" We went with the hot cheese balls as an appetizer, which were frankly, pretty awful. Lesson learned: always go with the mozzarella sticks.  I had a side salad with balsamic which was the best part of my overall meal as the vegetables which delicious (especially the tomatoes). But now, this is where it took a turn... not only was a band filtering in and making a racket and pressuring us to leave, our food just took forever to show up. To the point where I really wasn't hungry. As such, my wings ended up not being appetizing which was probably a mix of being full and not liking the flavor. I went with hot garlic parm and while the wings were big, they were incredibly soggy and disappointing.  We'll be back to give them another try... and hopefully they do better.",

I brought half of my burger home and it still had a great taste even though it was no longer warm.

The dining area is close to the open kitchen  and there is  a  very large separate bar room with giant TV screens throughout.  It appears it might become  very loud inside the bar once it is fully packed. The Rochester Inn is definitely on my must return list.  However, I will use caution when deciding on dessert as my slice of  carrot cake was clearly enough for  3 people and ended up costing more than my burger.",

    "text": "My parents have been here on a couple different occasions and have always talked about how good the food is, however last week I met with them for dinner on a Thursday evening and I can't say I will ever want to come back.  It was completely packed, but my mom was able to get a table in the middle of the dining room and my dad and I arrived shortly after.  A waitress came to take our drink orders and we asked if it was OK if we waited for my dad to arrive. Our drinks arrived and shortly after, so did my dad.    It wasn't for another 15 minutes that we saw our waitress again to order my dads drink and all of our food.  I ordered the salmon & broccoli with Caesar salad, my mom got the reuben and my dad had BBQ wings and a cup of chili.  The food took about 20 minutes to come out, which was understandable, because it was so busy.  When it was brought out to our table, everything looked good, however it did not taste the way it looked.  My broccoli was cold and had no seasoning or salt on it.  The salmon was insanely dry and flavorless - hardly edible even doused in one of the three sauces it came with and the Caesar salad was good, but the dressing had WAY too much lemon in it - very sour. My mom said her reuben was just OK. the bread was not buttered and there was hardly dressing on it.  Dad's wings, which I tried, were basic  - tough and didn't seem that great of quality. He said his chili was overly packed with beans.  We did not see our waitress again until she brought out or checks.  Poor service and terrible food during our visit - I even commented to my mom after we left that it was probably the worst meal and experience I have ever had at a restaurant.  I can't believe this place was so packed...but maybe it's a different story when youre just coming for the bar.  The interior is nothing special - certainly not fancy.  The tables are strange wooden tables that you'd find at your grandmothers house and the bar area is enormous.  Very casual.  Our table was sticky and the floors weren't very clean - just very bizarre.",
