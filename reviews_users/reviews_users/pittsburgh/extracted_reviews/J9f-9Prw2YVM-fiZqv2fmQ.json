    "text": "Every city has its share of restaurants that are beloved by locals so much that they become institutions.  The quality of the food is often irrelevant, as locals will come to swear by the restaurant and proclaim its greatness over every city's equivalent.  The Original Hot Dog Shop in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh is a prime example of this type of restaurant.  The hot dogs are above average, but by no means achieve the level of greatness proclaimed by alums of the University of Pittsburgh.  They have a nice grilled taste and feature good quality meat, but there is nothing terribly unique about the hot dogs . The choice of toppings is limited, and the hot dogs have a standard taste, but the quality is solid.  What makes the Original Hot Dog Shop stand out is its french fries.  The fries are fried to order, and after a short time spent in the fryer, a quick dash of salt is tossed on the fries.  The portion size is beyond generous, as a small order could easily serve as a full meal for two diners, and the fries have a crunchy exterior with a soft middle.  The level of saltiness is perfect, and though ketchup is given with the fries, it is not needed, as the fries are so full of flavor that toppings are not needed.  You won't find anything new at the Original Hot Dog Shop, but it's a good local joint with solid hot dogs and exceptional french fries.",

Someone once asked me if I wanted to buy stolen jewelry off them while I was eating. I'm being totally honest too. - Their french fry portions have gotten smaller. They used to need two baskets for a large fry and now only need one. - Really expensive hot dogs.  - They have strict limits on ketchup. No I'm not joking. 2 for large fries, 1 for anything less.  I do recommend getting their legendary fries at least once and I do recommend the egg burger, but get it to go and go when it is light out.",

Tip #1: Don't use the bathroom, seriously, it will scar you for life. Worst. Bathroom. Ever. I have used it twice in life, once at age 12 then again at age 27. Both times I could have used therapy afterward.   Tip #2: Order a small fry if you're by yourself or with 1 other person- there will be much more than you expect, it's like a large McD fry x 6. Get cheese! The cheese is glorious while hot, but doesn't reheat well and gets minus one star because it used to be better 5 years ago.  Tip #3: Go tipsy! Otherwise you might look at the hygienic issues surrounding you and get turned off. But for all of its skankiness, I've NEVER known anyone to get sick here. In fact, it's saved me some nights from waking up hung over.  Tip #4: Enjoy!!!",

    "text": "I love this place. I've been here with family and friends at so many points at life that I feel like going to the O was part of my experience of growing up in Pittsburgh. If it was my birthday and we were eating out, where did I want to go? The O. Where was the place I had to eat at one last time before I moved to Chicago? The O. And the great thing is that there are tons of other people who have the same feelings about this place.  What's so great about it? Well, at the very least, some of the best frickin fries I've ever had in my life, and I know my potatoes. Crispy and salty and large enough to feed a small army (or my teenage brother and 2 friends). The cheese sauce is packaged, and I don't know what kind of magical ingredient they sneak in there, because it's way more delicious than it should be. I've raved up and down about the fries to all my friends, and my favorite thing is to see their look of disbelief when I tell them about the portion size turn to wide-eyed amazement when the heaping mass of spuds is placed before them. I can't say I'm too adventurous with the menu- I've never had the philly steaks or pizza because to me the only natural accompaniment to the fries are the Super Dogs (their incredible bounce-back-when-you-bite-into-them hot dogs with cheese and bacon). It's really handy that UPMC Presbyterian is close by.   The other thing I love is that the O is unpretentious as hell and proud of it. Is it sketchy past 9 pm? Yeah, probably. Are the bathrooms gross? I've never had the courage to discover for myself, and a friend who did shuddered and wouldn't speak of the experience. But to me, that speaks for its authenticity, that it knows it's a neighborhood joint that people go to, in part, to experience some kind of Oakland rite of passage or to relive it.   Just don't schedule a doctor's appointment for the next day.",

Perhaps I didn't go at the prime time (it was about 3 pm), but the hot dog was dry, greasy, and simply lacked taste. The fries (which so many people have written about) were not very crispy, and I didn't think that they really stood out either. Perhaps I went at a time when there was less turnover of food, but when you have the reputation that they do, and when I am paying $4 for a hot dog - I expect it to be at least average.

Usually I get a smile and a conversation ice-breaker.  It's been years since I've been here, but by all indications, little changes.  In Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood, the heart of the college district, \"The O\" represents all of the angst and energy, the culinary hedonism and \"WTF\" attitude of my undergraduate years (in Cleveland).  Hot dogs are their namesake, and they're alright; the burgers and steak sandwiches are okay.  What everybody remembers about \"The O\" must be seen to be believed.  An order of fries or onion rings is huge beyond anticipation.  I would suspect that a few orders of fries from \"The O\" would have carried Napoleon's troops across Russia in the middle of winter.  Quantity aside, they're good.  You won't find the crisp, double-fried french fries or duck fat and truffle froufrou here; this is a roll-up-the-sleeves blue collar place.  I doubt that it is the cleanest place I've ever eaten in, but this isn't a place for whining and complaining, calorie-counting or sustaining a healthy diet.  It's cash-only, and there's no parking for blocks around, but that would be whining and complaining.  Order, sit down and gorge; eating can be this simple!",

    "text": "Every large university area I have been to seems to have a hot dog shop near it. Some are great others are not, but one this is True is that they all offer cheap eats. In this case we have an oddity, a fairly expensive hot dog stand offering poor food.  OK I know this place is an iconic Pittsburgh institution but the food is sorely lacking. First of all if you want a dog or two and some fires you have to stand in two different lines, so either you dogs get cold or your fries get gold while you are waiting for the other. LAME.  Second complaint the dogs are cooked on a griddle where they sit and sit and sit drying out, my idea of a hot dog is not a semi-blackened piece of jerky meat, it should he juicy and succulent. It's too bad that they ruin their dogs this way, getting past the dried out part the taste of this dog would have been pretty good if prepared correctly  Third complaint the buns - what is with east coast people and their feeble wonder bread buns they serve hot dogs on? You have two main components: The dog and the bun, both of these should be of high quality if you skimp on either one you will have a sub-par hot dog.  Fourth complaint - complete and utter disorganization of ordering, waiting and paying for your dog. You would think that some genius would be able to how to figure out and streamline the process to make it more efficient. Also hire some employees with some personality the three that were there seemed to hate their jobs.  Fifth complaint - $ 7.75 for two regular dogs (this was a special too) and a drink is ridiculous, throw in fries and I'm over $10 bucks - that's highway robbery for what was served.  FOOD 1.5 stars - it's hard to screw up a hot dog but they did it SERVICE 1.5 stars - I think if anybody smiled their face would have fallen off. VALUE 1 star, OK I have to give at least 1 star according to yelp otherwise this would be zero.  Total: 1.33 stars  For hot dogs in PA both The Frantuary (2 stars) has won in the toppings contest while Wiener World (3 stars) has the best dogs and buns.",

I was not disappointed.  Now, let's talk about the fries. WOW.  We got a small and this could easily feed 4 people. HUGE portions.  They do not skimp here and the price is right.  My one pet peeve:  why two different lines for hot dogs and fries?  Can I just order both at the same time at the same window?  Doesn't make a bit of sense to me to pay for my hot dog then have to walk over to the other side of the restaurant to order and pay for my fries?

What was nice is that each different type of food was ordered and prepared in a separate area, so lines moved quickly.  We stuck with the hot dog section and each had a hot dog, got one order of fries and an order of chicken fingers.  When they tell you a small order of fries serves two, they aren't kidding.  The basket was overflowing with perfectly seasoned fries with just the right amount of crisp.    I have come to the conclusion that I prefer the standard \"not sure what is actually in it\" hot dog taste to that of the all beef, high quality dogs.  Not a knock against the O, it just made me enjoy my fries and chicken fingers more than the hot dog itself.  I did, however, love the chicken fingers.  Great flavor, moist and just the right amount of breading.  The downside for this Buffalonian is that they do not have blue cheese, so I just dipped them in hot sauce instead.    I had no idea that the O served alcohol, so it was a surprise to see not only a selection of tap beers, but also a cooler that wrapped around the restaurant with everything from Boones Farm to high end microbrews.    I'm glad I went and experienced their \"famous\" fries and enjoyed my food and experience.  However, I probably won't be back until the next time I am really craving greasy, late night type food.",

You'd feel like a slime ball when you left, 2am. That's how you feel 2 steps into the O. And for god's sake order to go, can't recount how many wild characters I've seen gathered here once the sun goes down. Employees remind of the albino from Princess Bride. Have seen people not get their food AND get turned away a la Soup Nazi.  Get the smallest fry order, they're just too large and oily to tackle otherwise. The pizza's on point for salty and cheap NYC drunk March-Madness pizza. We used to eat 5 slices during the 12:40p tip game on First Friday and return after our brackets were busted by the 6-7p dead hour. The pizza's center slop is the best part, lovingly referred to as \"the fetus\". And you can pound a large on your own.  So here's the drill: 1) Drink a few beers to prep 2) Call in 1x large cheese pie per person, to go 3) Slam another beer to buzz-maintain 4) Have your DD drop you off out front once you're rocking that 3 beer buzz 5) Arrive EXACTLY as the pizza is due 6) Hope for an uneventful 5 minutes 7) Pink Floyds \"Run Like Hell\"  Parking can be a snag on crowded college nights so bring two friends--one to circle the block and one to watch your back.",

The service was abysmal, no organization at all, no personality and no customer skills whatsoever.. Order and pay for hot dogs from one counter and order and pay for french fries from another. This results in something being served cold while you walk over and order the other item and wait on it with the first hot item. No questions other than yellow or brown mustard. Signage was so cluttered and no prices by the hot dog counter left you basically at their greedy whim to charge you \"whatever\". Drinks are under lock and key, literally, they have locks on the soda cooler doors. Might have been the spot in the past but just a dumpy, dirty, overpriced, poorly run, poorly organized money maker for someone. Never again I can guarantee that.",

When you walk in, walk immediately past the hot dog counter (they're okay but not important) back to the fry counter. If you are with 3 or fewer people, get a small--it'll be more than enough. I'd come in with a group of seven and get a medium (\"serves 3-4\") and it was always MORE than enough. Purists will claim you don't need anything but salt on the fries, but I always liked that ersatz cheese sauce. It lent just a touch of class to the whole experience. It's basically the same thing as a Mornay, yo!  And the fries? Hot, crispy, fluffy on the inside, glistening with oil that burns your tongue when you put it in your mouth. The oil probably hasn't been changed since 1974, but that's part of the charm. Anyone who's anyone knows these fries are where it's at. Forget Five Guys, screw Point Brugge--this is the True Pittsburgh potato-based food experience.  DO NOT GET THE PIZZA WHATEVER YOU DO. I DON'T CARE HOW DRUNK YOU ARE. You always hear stories of various heinous crimes happening here late at night, but I've never known anyone who's ever had anything happen to them personally--it's always something that happened to a guy a friend of a friend's cousin knows, or you read about them happening at some ungodly hour of the night in the Post-Gazette. Don't let that scare you off! This is a Pittsburgh institution and for good reason.  Oh, also I saw Dan Marino here one time and didn't recognize him and everyone made fun of me. The end.",

Service was good, they were ready to take our order when we walked in the door. I watched them as they made our food, my mouth couldn't stop watering! We both ordered 2 chilli cheese dogs with onions... Yumm!! This is my first time having their hot dogs, so I didn't know what to expect. Before biting into my first hot dog I had to smell the aroma from the chilli, cheese, & onions. Biting into my chilli cheese dog I got a lot of great flavors. But at the same time I tasted the iron grill that they cooked the hot dog on. I was not a fan of that flavor at all, so that was a turn off! I may try them again since it was my first hot dog experience there.",

The menu is ridiculously confusing and most (not all) of the workers are unattractive and unfriendly and simply don't care and don't care to help you.  And the food is sooo unhealthy! After ordering a hotdog and a small fry, one of the workers was like \"Anti-diet food right there,\" he said.  Oh, and the bathrooms aren't much bigger than the large fries!! If you actually manage to find them and survive the climb down the veneer lined, near 90 degree angle stairs.   So why the 4 stars?

The large is literally an entire bin from the frier. Our group ate maybe 1/8 and tossed the rest.   The dogs are good, though not in the Grays Papaya category.

Definitely recommend these! However, the cheesesteak hoagie (sub) and mushroom cheesesteak hoagie were below average. The meat reminded me of the frozen thin packaged Steak-Ums and it was very tough. Plus, be warned that they charge extra for ketchup...yes, really. You get two containers with a large order of fries, then you have to pay 45 cents for each additional container. Also, restrooms are fairly disgusting, probably because, as my daughter explained, it's a late-night stop after the students hit the local bars.  Entrance is confusing initially. One counter for ordering pizza, one for ordering hot dogs, and a third for subs. Coolers are locked from the front, so you have to wait for the cook (who is also the order-taker) to retrieve your selection. Beer in cans and bottles is available in addition to soda.",

    "text": "There's something about a hot dog that can make any person's day better.  Does that sound corny, heck if I care.  The O is one of those Pittsburgh things, one part mythical and one part mandatory.  It is one of those places that any and all Pittsburgher should try at least once before moving on.  Believe it or not, this is only my second time trying this place and I've lived and worked in the Burgh for over ten years now.  People are always complaining about how this place has a negative appeal, I just don't see it.  You may have some bad things happen here, but that can happen at any business in any part of the city.  The hot dogs them self are amazing.  So many different ways to have them topped.  And, they are cooked fresh right in front of you.  They are first cooked on the griddle and then right before they toss them in the bun to be topped to your liking, they put them on a grill to give them that char mark and a little bit of crispiness.  Biting into one of these masterpieces is close to heaven.  Once you bite through that casing, it's like full flavor in your mouth.  My latest visit I just opted for the boring (yet tasty) ketchup, mustard and onion on my dog.  I'm happy I opted for it this way.  The flavor combination above did not over power the dog.  I also got some of their fresh cut fries, a small, not that colossal fry that I knew I'd be eating for three days and they were just as good.  A note to people, they ask if you want salt on them instead of just putting it on there.  So for all those health conscious, low sodium eaters out there, that solves it for you.  A few other notes on this place.  They accept credit cards instead of being a cash only establishment.  There is extra seating on other floors.  There is a walk up window for the warmer months.  Limited bar experience here as well.  Six packs to go.  Enjoy your dog here, or take it to go.  It is truly a one of a kind Pittsburgh experience.",

Their fries are a neat novelty, and you won't be disappointed by taste or volume.  Most of the time, the multiple pounds of fries are served in a loaf form, in the exact shape of the fryer basket.  Other than that, not many positive things to say about it.  The dogs do have a nice 'snap,' due to natural casings, but at $5.00 and up, not really worth the price.  Chili and other fixings are free, except for cheese, which is $1.00 (!) extra.  And the chili seems to be from a can AND HAS BEANS.  No thanks.  I'll take a Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe dog anytime, for barely over a buck.  The pizza was bland and slightly cardboard-ish, although I assume that it satisfies at 2:00 AM, after a long night at the bars or frat houses.  Go once for the fries, then leave it for the stumbling underclassmen to enjoy.",

He's a little rough around the edges but when the going gets bad he'll give you a giant hug and tell you that it's going to be all right. He's probably the only relative that is up at 3am that you can go to for some solace.   I was feeling a little down in the dumps but there it was, the infamous O beckoning me, 4 dollars for half a bag of fries? Yes. Yes please. I'm so sorry O. I rescind my previous 3 star rating.

You'd think that this rating would be higher, but ah I just cant seem to do it.  I will say though, that you should try the fries atleast once. Any time a friend from out of town heads to my place in Oakland, we usually head to The O. (normally it's their choice) So yes, the fries are great, but it kind of stops there. The other pros are the numerous bottles of beer, the retro atmosphere & the hours.  The one thing that bothers me is the crappy attitudes from the employees. Yes, the team that's working is normally semi-friendly, but there is ALWAYS that bad apple that is just so darn rude & hates her life + the world! ahh i can't handle it! Especially I'm handing over a $20+ just for the basics.  For example, we headed here this weekend with a 3 year old. My sister ordered her an all-beef hot dog with chili+cheese..... $6 (!!) for a flipping chili cheese hot dog!! Insane. & it's not like it's the best tasting hot dog or this giant, plump thing.. & the chili is completely tasteless   My sister & Bobby split a sub and all 4 of us split a giant wad of fries.. Everyone kept asking why I wasn't getting any food and the answer is: I only come to The O for the fries.   Oh,the creepy, smelly bathrooms also make em lose a star.   Come for the fries and the experience, but don't set your expectations too high.",

This place might have been impressive 50 years ago when there was nothing else to eat in Pittsburgh, but nowadays it's just boring, overpriced, and well past its expiration date. But if you like the taste of grease and canned cheese sauce, you'll love it.   On any given Saturday night, you'll often see greasy brown half-full bags of fries littered around Forbes Ave. These are the leftovers of drunk kids who got scammed into buying a laughably excessive order of fries when all they wanted was a handful to go with their hot dog. \"Quantity over quality\" and \"waste for the sake of waste\" seem to be time-honored traditions among Baby-Boomers around these parts, but anyone born after 1980 will likely be more disgusted than impressed.  The visible contempt they have for their customers is not at all charming like it is at a place like The Wiener's Circle in Chicago or other old-school dives wit genuine character; it's just alienating and sad. The O belongs to a class of old-guard Pittsburgh eateries that should have folded years ago, but is kept on life-support by a handful of deluded old yinzers who refuse to change with the times. Skip it.",

Also would pick up a six-pack of Stroh's beer. Well, the little 55 cent burgers and the Stroh's beer are long gone, but the fries remain, and are as delicious and greasy as ever.   Back in the day they served the fries in properly proportioned containers--now they put a little paper container on a tray and dump a huge quantity of fries over the entire tray. I wonder when this started and why? A medium was a full meal for 4 people! Well worth it when I periodically visit Pittsburgh.",

After reading the reviews, it sounded like things had really gone downhill.  People complaining about it being filthy, dirty, and the hot dogs being disgusting.  So I was a little nervous when I walked in, but when I did, I found out that it was the same old O, and also that there are a bunch of whiners here on Yelp.  Seriously, whining about having to order your fries from a different counter than your hot dog?  Seriously?  Like someone else said, order your fries, then go get your hot dog (with mustard, relish, and sauerkraut, please!) and then go back and get your fries.  Be sure to get GRAVY with your fries.  Haha, and all the whining about the bathroom.  Seriously?  Did you really think that the bathrooms in that place would be clean?  Seriously?  I've never actually gone down the \"staircase to nowhere\" where the bathrooms are.  At least not that I can remember (i.e. I quite possibly did in a drunken stupor one day.)  Where is the street smarts in kids these days?   Of course it gets crowded at night.  But, if you go in the daytime, there should be no real wait.  Plus, your chances of being the victim of a drive by go WAY down.  Y'all SHOULD be up in arms about what's happened AROUND the O.  Zelda's turned into a 5 guys?  WTF?  C.J. Barneys turned into a DUNKIN' DONUTS?  You've got to be f-ing kidding me!  You go to the O for awesome (but greasy) fries (don't forget the GRAVY!) and decent hot dogs.  The burgers and chicken parm sandwiches are good too.  The pizza has never been good.  But you have to eat O pizza when you're drunk anyway.  You just do.  I guess if you want sterile chain burgers and fries you can just go next door to 5 guys now.  But if you want to be shot at while eating tasty crispy dogs and a mountain of fries with ketchup and gravy cooked in the same grease for the past 50 years, while drinking a 40 of malt liquor, you've got to go to the O.  I guess you either get this place or you don't.",

If you misunderstand this and expect a place to study (you can, and I have on slow times), you will be unhappy.  if you order their exotic dishes, then you will be disappointed.  if you get a hotdog, get a good one, like an all-beaf. Also, they can miss things sometimes.  But, splitting a fries with a friend here, priceless.  And, do, if you are hungry, go on, get a large.  they are expensive, but if you are hungry you can finish it.  worth a detour from the highway to try it.   Locals also tell you, if there is fight, they tend to not bother the tourists or students!",

Take a minute, when you walk in to familiarize yourself, there are two entrances, come in on Forbes, and to your right, you will see a wall-o-hot dogs.  You will clearly see why you want one of these awesome dogs.  If it's your first time, get a regular dog, and a super dog, pack on the mustard and onions.   Ketchup if you like, (I'm a Chicago purest, so none of that for me), your favorite soda, I recommend a coke, and order some fires.  This should fill you up nicely, and if you want more, then good luck, portions are large.  There are seats in sight, or you can find the additional seating past the \"O\".  Cash is king, makes things easier, and know what you want on it (toppings), to speed you along.",

    "text": "I've been here once to eat (over a year ago) and two weeks ago to pick up a six pack of Mike's.  I would have never thought to come here for a six pack, but needing to get one for a party and having read that many beer distributors don't sell them (gah, PA liquor laws), I asked my labmate where I could pick one up, and she suggested the O.  Of course, I forgot the cash only policy (under $10 orders), so I had to run around to find a functional ATM (the one on Forbes was out of service).  Normally, this wouldn't be a problem for me, since I usually carry some cash, but having just returned from a trip, I was fresh out.  Ten minutes of running around later, I was able to purchase my Mike's and be on my way.  When I ate in, I came here for dinner with a couple of friends on a Fri. night around 6:30.  One of my friends suggested it, since he'd heard that CNN rated their french fries as some of the best in the country.  We ordered a medium order of fries, and there were plenty enough for all three of us to share with no problem.  Although I don't know if I'd concur with CNN's verdict, they were definitely some of the best thin-cut fries I've had in PGH, speaking as someone who doesn't usually care much for thin-cut fries (for thick-cut fries, I recommend the Pub Chip Shop).  We also ordered the cheese sauce and the gravy dips to go with the fries (note: they charged for all of them), and although the cheese sauce went with them well (it's your typical Velveeta-type cheese fry dip), I was underwhelmed by the gravy, which I found salty and greasy.  In addition to the fries, I ordered a chicken gyro, which was dry and flavorless, and a chocolate milkshake, which was thick and delicious.  I can't comment on the hot dogs, since I don't eat beef, so I'll have to defer to other reviewers for that.  If I come back, I think I'll just get the fries and the milkshake, and maybe try dipping the fries in the milkshake, Frosty-style.  The atmosphere is grungy, so don't expect it to be the cleanest place you've ever eaten.   Service was curt when I ordered dinner, but was okay more recently.  Although I haven't been here late at night, I understand that they charge a premium for the food at that hour to subsidize the rent-a-cop that they keep on hand to avoid brawling between drunk customers.  It's worth trying once, but I don't know that I'll be back unless I have a craving for fries or am looking for late night eats.",

The inside was just nice and what you would expect from a hot dog shop/diner type of setup.  I got the superdog which is jammed with stuff if you get everything on it. Now it wasnt spectacular but it wasnt bad. Now what sends this place over the top are the fries. They basically give you a massive amount, that cannot be finished unless your with friends or your last name is kobayashi.  Overall I thought it was great and I wouldnt mind coming back to try other stuff. Also if im hungry or a poor college kid or just hit with the munchies I would come here just for the fries.",

Hot dogs and side of fries at one counter, hamburgers and \"shareable\" fries at another. Just streamline the process... The staff appeared to be absolutely miserable and were completely devoid of personality. The prices are high for a hot dog place ($18 for 2 hotdogs and 2 fries). I ordered cheese on the hotdogs as I was unaware that this would mean they literally put a piece of American cheese on top (gross) when I was expecting a cheese sauce of some sort. The hot dogs did have a nice snap, but they were dry and I only had 3 bites before I couldn't tolerate it. The two stars are strictly for the fries, which were very good.

Perfectly cooked everytime they literally have it down to a science. They're sandwhiches and pizza are pretty good also. Something for everyone there! Hope to see this longtime pillar of the neighborhood survive another 50 years!",

Prices are fair for a dog shop, fries are the real attraction if your looking for them greasy taters. Sure there is a compitater on the same block but who cares about atmosphere. Dirty O will always take the cake in that category. Glad they cleaned up the bathrooms a bit because that was a dungeon you didn't want to enter. So grab a small fry to share with a party of 3, a sixer or some 40's, and sit and enjoy the wonders of Oakland.",

The hotdogs are hot and have grill marks. You have a lot of choices when it comes to topping your hot dog. They have bacon, jalapenos, onions, relish, cheese, chili, and possibly a few other toppings. I like to keep it very simple and just have brown mustard.  The hot dogs have a\"snap\" to them when you take a bite. They are really good hotdogs. They are longer than a regular hotdog but not quite a footling.  They make each serving of French fries when they are ordered so you get them hot and fresh. They ask if you want them salted (Yes!). Their serving size is big. One serving is 2 if not 3 times bigger than a McDonald's large fry. These fries are fresh cut potatoes. They are fried to the right temperature and have soft and crunchy parts.  No matter what you order you can't go wrong.",

On a recent visit to Pittsburgh I was trying to eat like a local: I ordered a burger and fries at this joint and then sat down to eat.  There's a huge beer selection and everything is pretty cheap.  Atmosphere is pretty grimy.  No question that the fries basket is enormous.  The portion is downright shocking in fact.  But as soon as I sat down I noticed a truly foul, rank odor, sort of like a restaurant dumpster on a hot July afternoon.  I thought it was coming from the person next to me, but in fact, to my horror, it was coming from my french fries!  I tasted one.  Blecch!  It was rancid and totally revolting.  They are frying a few hundred pounds of potatoes every day in the same oil, day after day!  It's horrible!  I picked up the entire basket and dumped it in the trash.  Now I know that the locals love this place.  But if you are an out-of-towner and you are expecting good food, BE WARNED.  It's quantity, not quality.",

I get mine w/ brown mustard & kraut. Their fries come in generous proportions (I recommend the small for two people), and are generally crispy and fresh.

Where else can you go and spend $4 on a 1 to 2 ft high pile of french fries?  They are fresh cut and don't come frozen out of a paper bag.  They taste DAMN GOOD and better yet they serve Kraft Cheese Whiz!  Not the imitation, the one and only KRAFT!  If I had a penny for every time I was there drunk or sober, I'd give Trump a run for his money.  You go to the \"O\" with friends.  Never by yourself.  Now granted it's been 15 years and with the price of inflation, I can remember spending $1.50 on a great hot dog.  This hot dog had some snap to it.  Also, a large pizza cost $5.  You can go here for less than $5 a person and feed the cast of Entourage, including all of Vincent Chase's women.  I miss this place like there is no tomorrow.

Usually this happens after a night class and before I go home to sleep of the working full time going to school part time blues. The food is plentiful but I will say that the prices are a little steep for what it is.   I went here last for national hotdog day. I was expecting some fanfare or something but the employee told me that every day is national hotdog day for him. Ok, I mean, I get it...but no discounts? No nothing? So I got two hotdogs with a slew of toppings and the price came out to be almost $9. Um... for two hotdogs. I mean they were great, really hit the spot but that price....eh...   We also got a basket of fries for four people. Massive! But again ketchup and cheese were extra and the price tag of the massive fries were $10. Again...they were great, but that price..eh...  I also spent the rest of the night downing water because my sodium content was way off the charts.   I like the O, it is some place that I think everyone needs to try once. I am not saying it is my go to, but it is fine for a once in a long while whim. The atmosphere is different and quieter than most of the other places you can head to in Oakland. But the price for what you get, this is not a place that I will come back to often.   It is good, salty, and fast but the order will hit your wallet for sure.   Everyone should try it out and go here once. Get the big basket of fries late night and just enjoy the atmosphere. It is a good place to pull up a table and chat after a long day of work and school.",

They know people will come here and fork over their money so they can say they ate at \"The Dirty O.\"  The Original has been around forever--my father-in-law would eat there in the '60s when he was a student at Pitt.  The hot dogs are fine, the burgers are fine, the pizza is fine. There is nothing overly mind-blowing about the place.   Oh, and the sauerkraut was COLD. A definite turn off in my book.  The fries are good, but I didn't find anything all that special about them. The employees do their jobs, but don't expect an exciting interaction with them.   Quite honestly, the best thing about the Original is the upstairs seating area. It's quiet and doesn't smell like grease. AND it has great views of the public milling around the area.   As a Detroiter who has consumed coney dogs her entire life, I can say that The Original has nothing on the hot dog shops of Detroit.  Skip the Original. It's not even worth saying, \"I've eaten there!\"",

Now, they are banking on nostalgic alumni and reputation versus being cheap, but the dogs are still good.  My friend and I stopped in after a Wednesday night class for a quick hot dog.  People swear by the fries, but as a non-fry eater, I think they are edible and nothing more.  I ordered a cheese dog with jalapenos ($5.34 w tax).  The cheese dog is good, but in New York I can get two cheese dogs and a drink for $5.  The quality and price just don't match up.  Try it once if you want to see what the fuss is about, but it's not really somewhere I feel the need to come back to.  The help leaves something to be desired, and the place is super grungy.

They're located in the middle of a college town, open late night on weekends, sell many types of beers, have a very large menu, and famous for their hotdogs and French fries. Before I came here today, I ordered two 1/4 lb beef hotdogs at Wiener World for a taste comparison, one with chili and kraut, the other with relish, ketchup and brown mustard.  Here, I got two kosher beef dogs for $9.25. One had chili (they were out of kraut) and the other had pickle, ketchup, and brown mustard. The dogs here are slightly burned, giving it a satisfying crunch and have a distinct greasy and salty flavors that wiener world lacks. Further, the \"O\" is more generous with toppings and the chili simply tastes better here. Overall, the \"O\" is the winner!",

And I'll say it...I'm glad I didn't cross the Birmingham Bridge just  for this.  Still, something about it is charming and authentic and well, original.  And the food wasn't allll bad.    First the good:  The fries were plentiful and amazing.  I realize they probably never change the frying oil but I'm sure that's exactly what makes them so tasty.  And the gravy...get the gravy!!  It elevates the fry experience to a whole new level.   Also tried these fries with cheese; plain ol' ketchup; and bare naked.  Delicious any way you go.    The disgusting: The hot dog.  I'm sorry but I don't get the hype.  I like my hot dogs plump, juicy and preferably all-beef.  This was shriveled, crunchy, crusty, overcooked, and well...I don't know what's in a hot dog but it wasn't all beef.  I realized after ordering that you can in fact order an all-beef dog, but that leads me to the next point....  The confusing:  I know this is part of the charm and what makes this place an \"institution\" in Pittsburgh and a gripe from a newcomer is worth about a penny, but wow.  The menu is super busy and all over the place...leading me to miss the all-beef dog option. And I had absolutely no idea where to physically place my order (dogs in one section, fries in another, beer/pizza in another!!!).  Fortunately it was mid afternoon, not too crowded, and a polite kid behind the counter had a surprising amount of patience with me.    If for no other reason than a six pack of beer, I'm sure I'll be back at some point during my time as a part-time Pitt student.",

Their wiener (or sausage) is smoked and very tasty. The Chicken Wings are AMAZINGLY TASTY, TENDER AND CRISPY! I was Truely shocked by their tasty chicken wings and I promised they are absolutely the top5 chicken wings I have ever tried! You can have hot sauce (tastes like buffalo) on the side but I did not use it. If you really need sauce you can have a try but the sauce is not highly recommended (quite common.)",

The first thing that you'll notice when walking in is that you order fries, hoagies, and salads at the farthest counter and everything else at long counter closest to the door.  The burgers with everything on top (including egg) are good. But of course they are famous for the mountain of fries with the big package of ketchup they come along with. They are greasy and fattening and that's why I love them so much. Other stuff, like the steak hoagies and, of course, hot dogs are good too. I think the hot dogs have a natural casing on them, so they firm exterior that you have to bite through, which some people don't really like that much.  Still one of my favorites is the salad but of course at a place like this it's no ordinary healthy green salad. You can get it with chicken or steak on top. With a bunch of other good stuff on top; cheese, boiled egg, hot pepper, tomatoes, green peppers, etc. But the best part is a great big mound of french fries that they put on top. It's so good!! I know putting french fries on everything isn't for everyone, but on the bright side you can tell all your friends you had salad for lunch and not be a liar.  The staff can be kind of meh sometimes but usually don't mind making small talk. As a woman, I probably wouldn't walk in here after 11pm alone but the staff, from what I've experienced, are friendly enough. There is a small seating table on the first floor with more tables available on the second. They also sell several types of beer. This has always been a great late night place for nearby college students but I love it anytime of the day. MMMmmmmm.",

The workers here in Oakland always make me feel right at home. The disenchanted \"Next! Let's move it along now. If you don't have your order ready, get to the back of the line,\" screams love. Looking into the employees' glazed-over eyes as they lazily drift from station to station, shirking and grumbling all the while, reminds me of the same level of love and care my mother put into her delicious Thanksgiving meals. In fact, it isn't uncommon to be brought back to my infant days, being held in my father's loving arms. And that magic is part of the reason that Pittsburghers love the 'O.   The food here is the True reason I believe that The Original Hot Dog Shop  has developed its worldwide reputation (despite being the inventors of the hot dog). Google, \"gourmet restaurants in Pittsburgh.\" There is always two common variables: the high prices, and the high-quality food. The 'O manages to isolate the latter of the two, and knowing that you are always getting served the finest meal in Pittsburgh for pennies on the dollar is a great feeling. Peering down at a 4 pound tray of room-temperature fries often conjures up the feeling that this meal could not have been made by anyone but Gordon Ramsay himself. But rest-assured, it is simply the work of the highly-trained, highly-motivated kitchen wizards of The Original Hot Dog Shop.",

The chili was not fresh and a bit crusty. The service was not very good! The workers are not friendly or helpful & didn't want to answer any questions.

What you cant tell from the outside that most of the space is dedicated to some kind of deli/sammy shop. The dogs are upfront. It seems they are all pre-cooked and then put, along with stale bun, in a steamer. It was one of the worst dogs I have ever had anywhere in the US. The fries were hot, but tasted of old oil. I think it was almost $8 for a plain dog and fries. Kind of crazy.  Anyway, I was SO looking forward to going here because so many people said it was the best in the Burgh.

Wifey, my son and I are out here looking at colleges and he's also here to sing in the All-Eastern Region High School Chorus so we found a place to park (probably illegally) and walked down to The Original Hot Dog Shop.   Wifey didn't like the fact that the ordering process was a bit confusing, but we managed. I ordered my old standby - one Cheese dog and one Chili cheese dog, Wifey had one with Kraut and spicy mustard and the boy had two with ketchup (yes, I know...but the boy like ketchup). We also got an order of onion rings.   I forgot to ask what brand they used, but they have 'regular' dogs and all-beef dogs. We got the regular dogs that are natural casing and cooked on the griddle. I love natural casing dogs, but, alas, wifey and the boy are so-so on them. These dogs were VERY good, but I don't know if I'd say great-cooked perfectly, great snap, but the flavor of the dogs got lost a bit with the toppings. A very nice touch is that they steam the buns after the dogs are on them. The chili, however, WAS excellent and there was enough on one dog to actually put onto a second dog. Wifey and the boy like the dogs, but because they were natural casing they didn't love them. The onion rings were also very tasty...but a little oily. The only other downside is the food is pricey. $4.26  for one (though a second one is discounted)  This place is a Pittsburgh institution so I'd say give them a try. Dogs are very good, old-school feel, and a fun place to eat.",

Also, because of PA's liquor laws, alcohol isn't always easy to buy, so they have a bunch of 6 packs and stuff that you can get when you don't feel like finding a beer distributor.   But, it's always kind of messy, they have inconsistent hours, and they're understaffed. Not the employees fault though, and they do their best. It just sucks when there are a lot of drunk people not paying attention and the cook has to yell a ton of times to get people to order or pick up their food. But also, the only time it's really a good place to be is at 1am when you need drunk food. Also, the portions are huge. Unless you're someone with a huge stomach, if it says it serves 1-2, it serves like 3 1/2. Also, eat them all while you're there. I know fries don't really last long anyhow, but these ones are pretty greasy so in a few hours they're kind of too gross to be worth it.   Also, get the nacho cheese for the fries! It's super good.",

    "text": "Stopped into the Original Hot Dog Shop (also known as \"The O\" to some) for an early dinner on a Sunday evening after touring the Pitt campus.  Walking in for the first time I'll admit that I was confused.  I saw plenty of folks standing around and two lines.  Thankfully a friendly customer was able to explain the process: back line for burgers and sandwiches, front line for hot dogs, fish, and fries.    The woman working the front line was impatient to take my order as I reviewed the menu offerings.  I settled on a \"Super Dog\" - bacon and cheese and a chili cheese dog.  A few orders that were placed after mine were prepared and sent out before mine which seemed strange as nothing I got really required cooking.    Eventually my order was placed on the counter:  a Super Dog and a plain hot dog.  Hmmmmm...I reminded the server that I had gotten a chili cheese dog with my Super Dog.  She said she didn't remember.  I asked if I could get chili and cheese on the dog like I ordered.  She said she hadn't charged me for it and then just looked at me.  Soooo, ok.  I took a seat on the side of the quiet side of the restaurant.  The Super Dog was awesome.  I loved that they used big, long strips of bacon and the cheese sauce was dreamy.  So so good.    The plain dog was....well...a plain dog.  I wanted to asked for mustard or something but the woman was clearly done with me.  A rough first experience.  Clearly this place is great from all the other reviews so I might go back.",

I used to go to Pitt years ago and this place was a staple for my college days. The food was still good the service wasn't bad it was just slow for the amount of people that were in there. I got the Chicken O Club with fries. Their fries are some of the best in the business. A lot of families were in here eating today when I was there. I got a parking spot right in front of the place and parking was free for the holiday weekend I believe. Thanks for that City of Pittsburgh.",

The Original Hot Dog shop looks as OG as it claims to be, but falls short of expectations and seems to be a washed up version of its former self.  The interior is the old school style you'd expect out of a 1970s diner, but everything is just so old now, and almost repulsive in a way. I hate to say it, but sometimes it's just necessary to do some renovation and move on to newer times.  As for the food---the menu is super cluttered, which I guess is like the old times, but makes things hard to find. The hot dogs themselves aren't stellar...Not a big fan of the crispy skin, but otherwise, they are exactly as you'd expect from a hot dog. I didn't taste any difference between the all beef dog and the normal ones, which was kinda disappointing, but they are still tasty and perfect for an American food craving.  The toppings are classic---your typical relish, ketchup, mustard, onions. You can even get bacon and cheese if you want, but I thought the bacon was pretty dry.   A pleasant surprise was the fries, which cooked in peanut oil made them super toasty and crispy.   Overall, I still enjoyed my meal, and definitely satisfied my craving. To have a hot dog shop is already commendable in itself, especially considering how low of a food hot dogs are, and I hope they stick around for a while to keep an important tradition alive.",

Was surprised to see how empty the place was now.  Not sure if that is due to summer vacation or the fact that it's popularity has waned.    As far as the food goes, it is exactly the same (except for the prices which have gone up over the past 25 years).  I believe they have cut the room upstairs in half from 25 years ago as it was much smaller.  The 1/2 lb burger was quite simple but came with a huge patty of beef.  The pizza looked just as unappetizing as it did 25 years ago.  The fries were just as I remember them.    We took our son along but other than nostalgia, he said he wouldn't come back there.  We had to agree.....",

We were somewhere west of Pittsburgh, traveling 70 mph, well past dinner time. I suggested dropping into the University of Pittsburgh neighborhood where we would surely find lots of Thai and Indian restaurants, respite from the hamburgers, hot dogs, fries and soft drinks we'd been overdosing on.  I like the city of Pittsburgh a lot. I like the hills and all of the bridges that remind me of San Francisco. I like the Pitt campus neighborhood. Yes, I like Pittsburgh even in spite of the Original Hot Dog Shop.  This restaurant reminds me a lot of a college dorm room; so unsanitary, so unkempt that only college students could survive and thrive there. You go to the bathroom to wash up and you emerge dirtier than before.  But people around this college neighborhood like it, obviously. It's busy.   I don't know how we ended up here. Inexplicably, my hamburger hating friends voted for it (and those great Thai and Indian restaurants we looked for never showed up, no matter how much searching we did).  The hamburger, though made of frozen patties, was actually not terrible, saved by a good bun and toppings.  I didn't get any, but the huge piles of hot, greasy fries looked like a standout item here. Unfortunately, the guy working the hamburger counter was a pretty rude sort.   Goodsir, have you ever considered moving to New York? You'd enjoy it.",

I went there on a Saturday afternoon and there were a few other people in the restaurant although I imagine they get a decent carry out business since it's kind of small and only has a few tables.  I ordered the original hot dog, fries and a soda and after a couple of minutes, the food was ready.  The hot dog was wrinkly and overcooked and the some of the fries were burnt and way too crisp.  They do give you a decent amount of fries but I tend not to like places that burn their fries.  They also don't offer free refills although the manager did let a pregnant worman have a refill on the house which was a nice gesture (she was getting her refill while we were in line).  I just don't understand the theory of making people pay for refills; fountain drinks are so cheap and refills make everyone happy.  I was actually shocked that a place like this doesn't offer free refills.  The woman behind the counter was friendly enough although I really don't care about the service in a hot dog stand.  I was told that this place was the second best hot dog restaurant behind Nathan's.  I find that hard to believe and if it's True, the distance between one and two is miles and miles.  I left feeling gipped and unsatisfied.",

However, this place is open 24 hours and they do serve/sell beer too which is really good because if you're at Hemmingways when they close, you can just roll next door and get some drunk munchies. Just don't order the large fries.",

However, I have to dock them for  a) making it needlessly confusing to figure out where to buy normal fries and where to buy signature fries, and then acting surly when I didn't immediately understand the difference (yes, I'm sure it's part of their shtick, but have some patience with the kid obviously from out of town with no one behind him) b) not having terribly good hot dogs (sorry, but they ain't no Nathan's), and c) charging a large amount for an absurd amount of fries without having any clear option to pay a normal amount of fries for a normal price (luckily I brought someone who could share them with me.)   That said, the fries were reeeeeeeeally good. I'm sure I'll be back. Damnit.  [Edit - They do have a better option for ordering an smaller number of fries. Actually, I think they give you basically the same, insanely large amount of fries, but just charge you less for some reason. Either way, they're getting a star back, as the place is growing on me. ]",

    "text": "If you are from Pittsburgh, go for the nostalgia.  If you want even passable food, just stay away.  First, the famous fries:   There are a lot of them, yes, and they come in a giant congealed \"fry-ball\" you have to pick apart.   Imagine an Outback \"blooming onion\" that has been run over.  I don't even think the ketchup is Heinz (isn't that a crime in Pittsburgh?) because it tasted low-grade and is served in a little cup with a peel-away top like lunch box applesauce.  Second, the famous hot-dogs:  These are thin, flavorless, overcooked, crunchy hot dogs served on a steamed store bun.   I had chili and onions on mine, which clearly came from a can.  I've had better hot dogs at the ball park, and they cost about the same.  My friend had the chicken sandwich, which while OK, was exactly the same thing you can get at Wendy's down the street.  And while I don't expect much service from a hot dog and fries joint, ordering here is insanely complicated.  Each counter serves something different, and to assemble an actual meal requires some patience and dexterity.  I'm from Philly, and ordering cheesesteaks from Pat's isn't even this hard.  The Big \"O\" is another college tradition that is best left to college students.",

If you're looking to feed an army of hungry college students then this is absolutely the place to go.  What can one get at \"The O\"?  Well, try delightfully greasy pizza, thick hard hot dogs. triple thick milk shakes, and a mountain of french fries so large you almost need a wheelbarrow to carry them.  God only knows how many weekend afternoon hangovers I drowned in a sea of french fry grease, ketchup, and cheese.  The place has the right amount of dirty to make a hungover college student feel at home.  To visit Pittsburgh more than twice and not go to The O is a tragedy.  But some advice, go in the afternoon or early evening.  Late nights are very busy and sometimes the place is frequented by some unsavory characters.",

It sounds weird, but the pizza is only good for about an hour or so. For those of you that like day old pizza, this isn't the pizza to be eating day old. The fries here are actually pretty good but VERY greasy...even more so than anywhere else. They're made quick and you get your choice of dipping sauces and they really hit the spot.

However, the service is why I'm giving this place a 3 instead of a 5 star review. I went last week with my girlfriend after a long morning at work and decided I wanted to grab a sandwich. As we approached the front counter where you order food, we heard the man working behind the counter rudely tell another customer to get out of the way so we could order, but we were still looking over the menu so there was no reason for this. When I asked a question about one of the sandwiches, his attitude and verbage was super rude and sassy while he tried to make me feel like an idiot for not knowing what kind of bread a certain sandwich was served on. We then put down our order and received our food 10 minutes later. Food was tasty as usual, we sat in the upstairs dining area which is pretty empty most of the time. On the way out the side door of the restaraunt, the same cashier from earlier was on his way in from a smoke break. I asked for his name and I'm pretty sure he said Steve as he blew his hit into my face and bumped into me while walking back in. Probably never returning after that one, thanks Steve",

Lets just say that Pinks has nothing to worry about being Dethroned from #1 in my world. I went in on a Wednesday around 11am'ish and there was maybe 5 other people in the place already eating and I was the only one at the ordering counter and  ordered the All Beef wt onion, Chili & cheese and paid -$5.96, and at a separate counter ordered a Small order of fries wt Cheese Sauce on the side paying again -$5.92 for a Total of $11.88. Its a weird set up they have going paying at each counter but I guess there is a method to their madness and whatever works for them.  The Hot Dog did have a snap to it as advertised but it was overall just another Hot Dog and nothing special. The French fries did live up to its \"as advertized\" HUGE portion but over all I wasnt impressed with them considering some of the reviewers here saying they were the \"Best they have ever had\". The fries didnt even come close to the fries we made getting out of school in the 9th Grade and going over to my neighbors house and making fries in the \"Fry Daddy\" (Remember THAT sweet appliance?) We use to make them thick Steak House cut, Medium & thin cut and damn we had that shit down!! Now those were the BEST fries I have ever had.  So overall I say: Over priced & over rated Nationally. I dont know what the competition is locally in Pittsburgh so I'm not going to shoot anyone down in flames or step on any toes and I'll leave that to what the locals have to say here & as featured on \"A Hot Dog Show\".",

I had a hot sausage sandwhich the bread was hard enough to cut a person's gums the sauce  tasted like ragu straight out of a jar and the hot sausage was under cooked!!! who does that? Yep this is a place to be avoided.",

    "text": "As I am a Pitt alum, your skepticism, dear reader, of this review is natural. But still, lend me your ears (err, eyes). Yes, the O is an infamous Oakland institution, your first accidental order of large fries is a rite of passage when you're a Pitt student, the regular employees look like they came out of a slasher flick, the setup is questionable, and the place is dingy as all hell.  Now, all that out of the way, how's the food? Well, it varies. In general, anything they do in-house or get private label is quite good. To elaborate, their fries are cut fresh, their hot dogs are made exclusively for them, and the hoagies are made to order without frozen ingredients. These are all wonderful. The fries shouldn't be even called fries in a strict sense; they're prepared in the same manner as French or Belgian frites. Due to double frying, the outsides are potato chip crispy, the insides are sublimely creamy, and they're deftly salted. The fact that they're served in absurd portions adds to the experience, as do the lowbrow but delicious options of processed cheese or beef gravy as dips. The hot dogs are natural casing and thus have an unparalleled snap. They lack the mushiness commonly found with lower quality dogs and so eat more like a piece of meat, with excellent spicing to boot. Factor in free chili (among other toppings) and a piece of freshly steamed cheese for $0.50 and you have drunk food bliss or sober great eats. Although I've never tried the subs, I've heard nothing but great things.  The rest of the menu is, unfortunately, mostly pre-frozen including the 21 shrimp (which I admit to gorging on while inebriated), chicken parm sandwich, and fish dinners. Not worth the dough you have to shell out. Why you would order pizza here with $5 Sorrento's or $8 Romano within walking distance is beyond me. The beer selection is puzzlingly excellent.",

    "text": "While this place is a favorite with local college students, its appeal has gone nationwide with their hotdogs being considered the 4th best in the country according to Gourmet magazine.  And they offer up several variations and allow for a whole host of toppings including cheese, mustard, ketchup, relish, sauerkraut, and chili.  I opted for one of their new dogs which has cheese and jalapeno peppers inside of it, and really enjoyed it.  Beyond the hotdogs though, they are also famous for their ridiculously sized portions of fries.  I ordered the small which can easily feed two people by itself.  And they have a six pack shop with several hundred brands of beer available for purchase.  Yeah, college friendly to be sure.    Some notes on the experience:  - Lines are long even at off-peak times, and sometimes people order for several people at once, so be prepared.  - Hotdogs are available up front, but fries are available in the rear.  So if you want both, you will have to wait in line twice.  Annoying!  - There is ample seating on the second level with a nice view of Forbes Avenue.  The place is a historic landmark, and is definitely a good roadside stop.  If you are ever in the 'burgh, check them out!",

Sure, there's pizza and subs and such but why would you chose those over the superb dogs and taters.   The fries are legendary: tasty as hell and absolutely huge servings. Amazingly large. Shit-ton large. Order a small unless you're sharing. Period.  The dogs are really good, with a great variety of toppings and other variations. Just great.  So, if I like it so much why the missing star? One word: dirt. It's known as \"The Dirty O\" and that's a well-earned name. There's a decades old patina of cooking grease on everything, and while I don't have a problem with it, chances are someone in your party will and will make an issue of it. But if you can get past that (and keep your food on your tray) it's a five-star place.",

The \"O\" is most famous for its very healthy french fry portions, it's all-beef hot dogs with numerous free toppings,  a small fry here is legitimately too big for two people, and an all-the-way dog is a mountain of mustard, sauerkraut, pickles and who knows what.  They also have pizza(don't do it) and chicken tenders and whatnot, but just do fries or a hotdog and you'll be ok.  The Original is what going out to eat is all about; pigging out and occasionally witnessing a fight between pimps. On that note Friday and Saturday nights are especially lit since the O stays open til 4 am and everyone is hanging out partying when the clubs and bars get out. Not to be missed if you visit the burgh. Try to avoid the bathroom.",

    "text": "Note: The O now accepts credit cards.   O is for Origins.  Lo, there is a place in Pittsburgh that serves french fries of mythical quality and in prodigious quantities, a place that is foreboding to some and is surrounded by legends both mirthful and menacing. Its formal, earthly name is The Original Hot Dog Shop. Its name to those in the circle and kindred of tongue is simply The O, and for the first time in 2 decades, I ate heartily there on a niveous Saturday without one bit of remorse.   O is for Old.  52 years ago, The O opened in student-centered Oakland (coincidence?), and since then, from its brown tile floors (which were clean this time) and vivid interior signage to its movie theater marquee, it has largely remained unchanged. I began coming here weekly when I was a student at now defunct Schenley High School in the top 80's and bottom 90's. A ritual for my mopheaded gang of pals and myself, we knew how to navigate The O when we visited, to not dally, to SHARE those french fries no matter how small the order called for, to avoid the restroom. I stopped coming  during my first semester at the University of Pittsburgh when I discovered that it was far away from campus and too pricey for my college-era budget.  O is for Options.  One aspect I've always found intriguing about The O is that it is somewhat reminiscent of a food court, and thus their selection of items is relatively vast. I recall them even having BBQ chicken and funnel cakes on their menu at one time. My favorite adversaries from the lost days of my youth were the mammoth subs of the steak and meatball variety as well as their (new at the time) surprisingly superb and cheap pizzas. I also never minded that there were stations for ordering different things. De facto, I think it's one of those quirks that adds to The O's mystique and uniqueness. Ranters and whiners: deal with it.   O is for Oily.  Yes, those fantastical french fries remain as rich, chewy, debased,and indulgent as they were when last I gorged on them moons and moons ago. A \"small' order of these wrathful, scalding goldenrods is thrice that of the average fast food chain, therefore threatening to overwhelm the novice visitor (intruder?). As a boy, I never thought of handling the jaundiced hoard myself. Today, I defeated them all, standing alone, leaving nothing but brown crumbs and traces of their mysteriously saccharine ketchup (all I was told is that it ain't Heinz) that comes in generously rationed cups. The skin of each tater staff is akin to paper melding with glass and when broken into reveals mashed spud manna. Doubly christened (cursed?) in bubbling peanut oil, I am once again convinced that there exists no other specimen of this obligatory side dish that matches the supremacy of The O's hellishly humongous heaps of froylated potato.  O is for Outgoing.  One caveat I had regarding The O in another life was that the employees were usually distressed, overworked, and as a result, often rude and impatient. Saturday's emprise was an entirely different and much more benign episode. A short, bespectacled, middle-aged woman in a sweatshirt  that could have been anyone's mother greeted me ardently when I told her how long it had been since my last encounter with The O. My order was taken and received without delay or attitude. I even got to pick a cook's brain and had a brief conversation with some visiting Southerners. No one looked haggard or intimidating in the least. The food, however...  O is for Ominous.  Not having been impressed with their hot dogs in the past, I went for their baneful dark horse of a sandwich, The Hot Sausage Sub, and unlike another reviewer, for me,eating it was a daunting, thrilling revelry. The bread was toasted yet plush, the sauce that enveloped it was rubicund, resembling a river of blood in which a dragon swam, that dragon being the sausage itself,one that is loaded with spice and succulent ground pig. Barely prevailing o'er The O's secret serpentine sentinel, I let out a loud belch with fists clenched, chest out, and chin upward, frightening co-eds and their parental units with my guttural, gaseous victory cry.   O is for Omega.   In closing, I have soberly relished almost everything I've ever ordered from The O's biblical bill of fare. My next visit will be soon. I shall neglect this institution no longer for The O has a menagerie of magnificent monsters that await defeat, including their fearsome franks. Beware my steel jaws, my unblunted, adamantine teeth, my stomach of smelted iron!  P.S. O is for...Oblivion?  Though not as squalid as I recalled it to be, a door is missing from the stall in the subterranean men's room. My advice is to run to the Subway down the street when nature calls and buy a 52 cent cookie while you're there.   P.P.S. With chains increasing their presence on Forbes Avenue, I hope The O outlasts them all, except for Subway -- I need their john.",

The fries are awesome, needless to say, given the previous reviews. I'm a ketchup kinda gal. So that's all I need. But to each his own, and while everyone I've been with loves the fries, it's interesting to see the different sauces people douse them with. My German exchange friend did mayonnaise while my roommate did Dijon mustard. Honorable mention to gravy.  This is college late night food at it's finest. If you're going to school in Pittsburgh, going to The O is a rite of passage.",

    "text": "Like Primanti's nearby, the history of this place helps keep it going, but if it weren't for that I wouldn't think much of it. A ton of beer selections plus your standard bar food, although this place isn't so much a bar as it is a dive as well as beer distributor. The ambiance and service of this place leave much to be desired (we contend that we were overcharged on more than one occasion here), but the food isn't bad. Their hot dogs are indeed quite good, grilled almost perfectly, and of course there are the fries. These come in huge servings and are quite possibly among the best in Oakland (though I would probably choose Uncle Sam's thinner cut fries if I had to).",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to the O for a Saturday lunch. It was fairly busy and the thing that stood out the most was how miserable each employee was. I witnessed employees talking rudely to each other and customers, eye rolls included. To me, the ambiance of a place is just as important as the food. I don't see the charm in rushing your customers to order.   There is a counter to order hot dogs and then a separate counter for sandwiches and fries, so it's hard to time your food if you're getting different things. My boyfriend's hot dog was ready at least 8-10 minutes before my burger and fries. He said it was one of the best hot dogs he's ever had, while I was not nearly as impressed with my burger. Overpriced and overcooked beef with an overcooked egg was very disappointing.   The best part of the meal was the fries, they were delicious!!! Although the sign about being charged for any extra ketchup requested just added to the unfriendly vibe of the place. I'd try it again late night when nothing better is open.",

    "text": "Growing up in Pittsburgh, I heard a lot about The O but never went in due to the bad rep it got from some violent late-nite incidents that happened there. Walked in on a sunny, safe day (& noticing the black-globe security cams), I got a large to-go order of fries & man, the bag weighed a ton. I felt like I won the lotto walking out with that bag & got a lot of knowing 'Mmmm, theee Oooooh' looks from people on the street who saw me cradling that hot oily bag like a big healthy baby in my arms. Could not wait till I got home so I sat on a bench & had my 1st taste & It Lived Up To Its Hype. Crisp warm golden mealy deliciousness with just enough oil & salt to keep you finger-lickin' happy. Fries came w/ 2 small ketchup bins (free) & 1 small cheese bin ($1.84). Was disappointed with the condiments especially the cheese...$1.84 for a small bin of Cheez-Wiz when you've given me all these fries?!?! (I've always wondered how they make a profit giving you so much food, now I know it's made from the cheese.) Does not compute, but I made do with what I had & the fries lasted 2 days & even tasted better cold. I eat a lot of Los (LocalOrganicSustainable) Hipster food & I'll take The Dirty O over those ironic pretentious twats with great stylists-publicists-social media strategists any day of the week. Needless to say, I will be back.  The O is everything great about Pittsburgh. Don't overthink it, just do it: Go to The O, consume mass quantities, & fall in love with Pittsburgh again for the very first time.",

    "text": "This place is very \"rustic\"...   Ok it's a dump, but the hotdogs are amazing which is why this place is a Pittsburgh staple. It's all about the food. The dogs have that \"snap\", and I always seem to gravitate towards the cheese dogs. You also get a mountain of fries if you order them so be prepared to carry around a 2 pound brown bag of French fries. The locks on the coolers of the drinks are a bit off putting, but as long as you're not here in the early hours of the morning you have nothing to worry about. There's also a bar to the left of where you order your food that I have yet to try but they seem to have a lot of different craft beers.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a dog and a beer on a recent weekend trip to PGH.  The \"O\" is a local institution that's worth checking out once, but that's about it. The hot dogs are the star of the show, and they are nothing special. I'd been before, and as I bit into my dog on this trip, I immediately realized that once was enough.  The draw of the \"O\" is that it's open til 3:30am. So if I'm staying in Oaktown, drunk and hungry after the bars close, I'd stop in for some grub. Other than that, though, I don't see me returning.",

I had the superdog (hotdog, bacon, & cheese) the bacon got in the way of the beef hotdog BUT I finished it ALL none the less... What I LovED was the fries!!! Massive amount of fries! I had a party of 3 so I got the medium... It was WAY more Han we could eat! The cheese with the fries made it superb!  I will go back next time in Pittsburg!",
