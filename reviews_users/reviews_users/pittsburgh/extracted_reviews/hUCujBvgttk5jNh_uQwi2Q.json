The menu accommodated the needs of my vegan friends who raved about the Seitan thingy. What impressed me most about my meal was the super fresh and flavorful bread that was used in my sub. I could have had more veggies on my sammie but I'm sure I'm an outlier in that respect. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to accommodate eaters with special dietary needs.",

Even the salads are pretty good. There isn't much seating, its more of a take out pizza place.

I couldn't believe hiw much flavor they had and the texture was close to an actual buffalo wing! I live about 40 minutes away but think about driving across town almost everyday just for the wings.

I first want to mention their seitan. For vegheads, this place has one of the best seitans that I have ever experienced. The rule of thumb is to try their seitan melts, especially with vegan cheese, it is heaven in a hoagie. Their vegan pies also does some justice but I think for all you cheese lovers, you might need to keep an open mind.  As for non-veg stuff. They provide. They rock some mad skills with their non-hippyified pies too and wings... check.   Listen, if you want the boring-as-hell pizzas then sure, there are a million joints out there. However, if you want an experience that excites each and every one of your tastebud, look no further.",

My usual pizza order is a slice with vegetarian sausage. $3. Delicious and easily the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  The pizza alone would make them one of my favorite places to eat in town, but it's the amazing seitan sandwiches that propel this place into one-of-a-kind territory. I've never had seitan like this anywhere else. It's tender, just the right amount of chewy, flavorful, delicious, and just great. I don't know anywhere else in America you can get a 6\" sandwich for $5 that is this good. Really! You can't go wrong ordering a seitan sandwich--choose whichever suits your fancy and you won't be disappointed.  Also--and this is just icing on the cake--the vibe is very cool. Friendly counter staff, super unpredictable variety of music playing, interesting local art on the walls, and two nineties-vintage pinball machines to while away the minutes as your food is made to order.  Spak is a fantastic neighborhood joint with really, really good food at cheap prices. Try the seitan.",

I've been here during the Garfield art crawl and it is PACKED, but that is to be expected.  What surprised me is how long you have to wait even on a typical weekday. My husband made the mistake of popping in after work to pick up a pizza and a hoagie without calling ahead.  Well, they were out of hoagies and the pizza took 45 minutes IN HOUSE. I feel like your typical greasy pizza place can get your pizza done in about 15. We learned our lesson and try to call ahead of time, but it's pretty common to either have the phone ring and ring, or someone pick up and put you on hold for five or even ten minutes.   Despite how popular this place is, I'm not actually all that crazy about the pizza. The sauce is a little on the sweet side for me, and I typically go for a thinner crust. It is a completely acceptable pizza- I'd certainly choose this over Domino's or something- but not the best I've had.  Their Italian hoagies ARE killer, tho and that's why keep going back- great quality meat, delicious bread.",

First, the pros.  -The pizza crust and ingredients are some of the best I've had from a take-out pizza place. -The wings are quite good and the blue cheese that comes with is delicious. -The sandwiches that I've tried are actually good, unlike the afterthought sandwiches you get from most pizza places.  Now, the cons.  -Recently they screwed up one of our orders, which is a mistake that generally wouldn't bother me too much except for the fact that they gave my girlfriend attitude when she went back in to get the correct food remade.  This was after we had to wait much longer than their estimated pickup time to receive the incorrect food. -Their ability to answer the phone in a timely manner is seriously lacking.  The last two times we've called we sat on the phone for several minutes or more, and nobody ever picked up the phone, even to ask us to please hold.  The appeal of ordering pizza is fast service and a fast meal, so sitting on hold without ever speaking to a person (even to acknowledge that they got our call) is really annoying.",

Definitely call ahead for pickup and then arrive 20 minutes after the estimated time they gave you. There isn't really a dine in option, just 5 bar stools, so plan to get it to go.

It's kind of like dog years...for every one minute you may wait to order at a normal pizza place, you will wait seven minutes at Spak Brothers. Alas, the ordering Gods smiled upon me and I only had to wait 8 minutes to place my order (on my third try). I went with a medium pizza- half pepperoni, half sausage- and the seitan wings with the honey mustard sauce. The honey mustard sauce had a little kick to it, which I wasn't expecting, but rather enjoyed. The seitan though...It was so chewy! Why? Why is it so chewy??? It was like eating a bike tire bathed in a delicious sauce. Everyone raves about these things...I've had better seitan from Whole Foods! I feel like I have to try it again just to see if it's always like that, or if it was just a bad batch.  The pizza was decent; the BF and I both liked the sauce. Other than that, there was nothing so amazing about it that I would go out of my way to get it. We plan to try it once more, but I am not holding my breath that the Brothers will redeem themselves.",

These guys are Masters of Seitan; in particular, the seitan wings and seitan cheesesteak are my absolute favorites.  I am assured the meat and vegan options are awesome too. All the sandwiches are on a delicious, crusty bread, and I personally am more blown away by their sandwiches than pizza, which is tasty and has lots of fun topping choices but is not the absolute best in  the city (that honor, in my estimation, is owned by Mineo's).  Expect to wait on the phone for awhile on hold at peak times.",

I was visiting town and a friend recommended the place immediately when I asked if she had a suggested for lunch. I ordered a pepperoni and onion pizza and sat down and waited. It was ready in about 15 minutes, and it was delightful. The crust was an ideal thickness and texture, and the cheese was melty and gooey and delicious. I'll definitely come back for a hoagie next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Spak Brother for awhile now. From co-workers raving about it to the artistic exterior to the building, I wanted to see what the hoopla was all about. I was in Bloomfield for work so I decided to stop by and grab a sandwich.   The inside is nothing to brag about. It's not somewhere I'd be comfortable eating inside at, but I don't think they market it that way so I can't really take points off because of that. There are a few places to sit and a pinball table, but nothing substantial.   The menu is decent sized. All the basics and nothing too too fancy. I went with the grilled chicken breast hoagie with lettuce, tomato, cheese and ranch dressing. It took about 15-20 minutes to make, but it was well worth the wait! Everything was so fresh and tasty. It practically melted in my mouth. The best part was the ranch dressing. It was so creamy and full of flavor. I am obsessed with homemade ranch sauces and this was one of the best I've ever tasted. The sandwich (half) was $6 including tax and I think it was reasonably priced. Most full sandwiches went between $8-$9.   I'm excited to go back and try some more options on the menu! Nothing better than supporting local business, especially those on Penn Avenue during all of this messy construction!",

The slices are pretty huge, and they offer many tasty topping options. They have a seriously hipster vibe, and I definitely did not feel that I was cool enough to get my pizza at this place. Would I return? Possibly. However, there are MANY other pizza places locally that are faster with service, offer comparable pizza, and that are more laid back in atmosphere.",

I love that PGH loves this place, but I will attach some serious caveats if you're trying to order at peak demand hours--order well ahead by phone, and keep calling back until you get someone. I once drove the 15 minutes to the shop before I got through via phone, and then I was warned off wings due to the time involved (understandable--freshly cooked is always nice). So be VERY prepared to wait, or call at least 90 minutes before you want your food!  Spak is also a short walk from Friendship Parklet if you are here during better weather and want some sunshine with your meal.",

Salads are amazing, and the hoagies too. GO GET FOOD HERE.  Only thing I can think of in the negative - do some sort of delivery. It's ridiculous they don't do it themselves, or sign up with a third party delivery. Also, there is never enough ranch or celery with the wings no matter how often I ask for some extra... a forgivable offense, but quit skimping on celery!",

Yet another might be to plan on being put on hold for at least 5 minutes when ordering from Spak (today and I gave up). Whenever it's easier to get ahold of my loan refinancing bank than a local pizzeria there are problems.   Anyway, the time I actually did place and successfully pick up a pizza the experience was quite underwhelming. The pizza was surprisingly thin, and while I don't have any particular problem with thin pizza I do when it is soggy and flaccid. It might have been undercooked. At least it wasn't too expensive.  I'd be willing to try Spak again (I did try today), but they really got to work on the whole communication thing.",

    "text": "Top-quality pizza? Not in my book. This pie does, however, taste identical to the sludgy squares passing for pizza that you'd find in a typical PA public high school cafeteria. I used to live less than 6 city blocks from this place and it was open during Penn Ave. First Fridays, so I ate here on occasion. And after the first bite, I figured out why it is such a success. It takes people here back to their childhoods, and such nostalgia is, for whatever reason, the barometer of \"tasty\" when it comes to pizza and other convenience foods in Pittsburgh.   As a former longtime resident of the Steel City, I get it. The economy is always tough, salaries are rudely low, Jeffy Romoff owns most everything (aside from whatever the banks sucked up, while you, the taxpayer, has the honor of footing the bill), and in most neighborhoods, being a homeowner entails feigning the requisite sense of deep delight at your weekly Saturday sessions spent giving the lawn a buzz cut that any military officer would salute. Those pressures can add up, kindling fond memories for the institutional government lunches you ate every weekday between September and early June before you turned 18 and were on your own. Simply put, Spak's takes you back to a simpler time, with pricing to match.   But Pittsburgh was never simple for me -- living at a subsistence level ain't fun after a while -- so when my spouse and I skip home cooking for fast casual pizza, I want to TASTE the flavors. I'm afraid I just wasn't enchanted with the offerings at Spak's. It's not their fault, either. They're simply catering to the market, and they know it well. Many longtime Pittsburghers have learned to expect very little (o hai!), so when a restaurant serves anything vegetarian at all, it instantly becomes a hit. But I want more. I want food that is marginally better than what you'll find at a typical Rust Belt public high school. If you do too, this is not the type of pizza parlor you'll want to spend your scarce free time visiting.",

The thin crust is quite good.  The sauce was just right.  There are a variety of toppings including vegan options.  In fact, you can choose vegan cheese if you like.  The price was also very reasonable for a large pie.  Overall, i was very satisfied with the pizza as well as the ambiance and service.  I just wished they delivered!",

Despite their many recent bad reviews, I gave it three last tries bc I wanted to believe they were still good. Sad to say all three attempts were terrible... the first had a flavorless bland crust with rancid tasting meat, the second was totally burnt and the third got my order completely wrong. I tried calling to set things straight but sat on hold for 35+ mins each time and gave up. I'm sure you don't care, Spak but I'm super bummed to say you lost yet another longtime local's business. :(",

    "text": "+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ WARNING: Spak Brothers Pizza is the hippest pizzeria ever...you are not nearly cool enough to eat here so you might as well just pack up your Capri Sun and lug your greasy mouth-breathing philistine ass back up to the Dennys there, guy. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  So I called to order my pizza and I am pretty sure that they just immediately put me on hold just so that they could show off their clever choice in hold music (which was Fugazi-The Waiting Room).  Luckily I am a patient boy and eventually they answered the phone so that I could order my large cheese pizza.  The large is only 14' which I guess is large by the standards of chain stores likes Dominoes but it was only $8 or so so the value isn't bad.    The interior of Spak Brothers Pizza looks like the restaurant version of a southside pan-handling street junkie punks guitar case, I guess it would be charming if I wasn't getting food here.    As for the pizza.....its not bad but its kind of close.    I will start with the positive first, the sauce.  This sauce is strangely original and delicious.  Its very heavy on the herby almost bitter side but they have created a really good balance with it that is quite unique.  The consistency is nice and thick with tomato strips and crushed tomatoes that seem of high quality.  I feel like I am tasting a lot of onion in the sauce but I don't see signs of any, the garlic is heavy but balanced really well.  The garlic brings out the sweetness of the tomato which meets the dark essences of herbs and its all just really nice.  It may be the best sauce I have had yet in the city.  So on to the negative.  These guys are using a brick oven but they use screens to cook the pies.  So what could be pretty ok pizza ends up tasting very close to a chain store floppy crap pizza.  The pizza had a huge puffy crust and a super thin middle so every slice drooped to the ground like a post-cocaine Dirk Diggler penis.  The dough was very flavorless too, the only flavor present at all was a generic taste of salt.  The dough reminds me of Papa Johns...but with salt.  It was a bit squishy but not crunchy at all, I really feel like these Spak Brothers got this dough recipe from their Papa, John.  Maybe if the pizza had been made well and stretched evenly and not made into a bowl shape it could have been less floppy and soggy but with the proportions that were going on it was doomed from the start.  Plus the pizzaman spread the cheese on the pie evenly and didn't account for how the cheese would move while cooking.  So the result was a lot of cheese migrating into the middle which was already too thin so you end up with pooling of grease in the middle and big puffy dry spots of dough on the outside.  They are using a tasty high quality cheese and the portion was pretty good had it been distributed well across the whole pie.  The pie was cooked well and was a good color but did not taste as it looked.    All my bike riding friends tell me that this place has \"great seitan wings\" or \"delicious veggie burger\" or \"yeah man, you gotta try the tree bark hoagie\" and I am sure the Spaks are probably great at making all of that kind of stuff, but they have a ways to go on the pizza.  If they were to hire some real pizzamen and start making the pizza on the brick it would do them a world of good, the execution is the main flaw here.  I would give it a try just for the sauce, I bet this pizza would be pretty good if you were to reheat it on a pizza stone at home and crunch it up a bit.  If you do order from them though you may want to pay a homeless person to go in a pickup your food so that you don't get scoffed at.    Rating: 5/10",

Every time I go, I expect to feel less confident about this but the confidence actually builds with every experience.  Vegan friendly and all natural, they don't even use high fructose corn syrup in their homemade sauce. Their crust is New York style, on the thinner side with a good chew to it but sturdy enough to fold over. Their topping, particularly their cheese, is cooked so that parts are brown. Nothing cooks into a thick, treacherous canvas that is mere seconds away from sliding off onto your nice shirt like Aiello's or Mineo's. They also take cards.  The Spak Brother's are nice, nice people and I've been fans of them for a while now. I don't know them personally but I've exchanged emails back and forth due to my review on my site. They know what they're doing and are happy to do it. Everything I've tried on their meny has been delicious.  I did a review of them a while back, if you'd like to read it: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Featinginpittsburgh.com%2F2010%2F06%2F01%2Fspak-brothers-the-best-pizza-in-pittsburgh%2F&s=962d57845330bf588012f1197657d959d0d83b6ea57af3e99c1fe0b0de085b17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eatinginpittsburgh.com/2...</a>",

    "text": "I ate here tonight for dinner with a dining companion that I have a regular contest to find the best pizza place.  Tonight was my choice and so I chose Spak Brothers as I had seen the good reviews on Yelp and had heard it mentioned in best Pittsburgh pizza joint conversations elsewhere.  Since I had never been here before, I did not know what to expect.  Whenever I walked through the door the first thing that hit me was the wonderful smell of pizza before I noticed what a tiny place it actually was.  That's not to say that there was anything wrong with it as it evoked in my mind what a pizza place should be with two pinball machines, a tabletop arcade game with Ms. Pacman and Space Invaders, a cooler full of water and pop and a bar with high top stools on the other side where you could eat.  They also had some \"art\" of random superheroes and other things that were for sale hanging from the walls.  My dining companion and I decided to split a whole XL pizza and she wanted it half plain and half chicken instead of our normal plain pizza.  Whenever our pizza came out it both looked and smelled fantastic.  After the first bite I decided it was very good as it had a nice garlicky sauce, a good amount of cheese and the crust/bottom was cooked perfectly.  I was also excited to see that in addition to your normal red hot pepper flakes, oregano, garlic and cheese that you can put on your pizza that they also had Old Bay.  Sometimes unconventional is good and I think in this instance that was definitely the case.  Overall I would currently place this as the third best pizza place that I have tried in Pittsburgh and it is worth your while to come here.  The bottom line for me is that I am already looking forward to coming back here in the future for some more pizza.  Not only was it cheap but it was it was also delicious.  I also told my girlfriend about the old bay and the sauce and now she is ready to come here as well!",

We left and went to the seitan wing originator, and we were infinitely happier for it.  Spak Bros. has very few seats inside, so you might consider calling in and picking an order up -- that's what most people appeared to do. We ordered the BBQ seitan wings and a seitan cheesesteak, which may not have been the best idea, since we were pretty seitan'ed out by the end of the meal, but we took our food to Mixtape and got a couple of cocktails to go with (the highlight of our evening). The wings were a bit salty, so I found that it helps to take smaller bites rather than popping the giant chunks into your mouth. If you've ever been to Veggie Grill in California, I'd say that the wings there are better, in terms of texture and flavor. More celery to balance out saltiness might help with these wings.   The cheesesteak was really good, and I would definitely get it again. Wasn't too dry, had some veggies, and the roll didn't get mushy/kept a good consistency. I used to love cheesesteaks (back when I ate meat), so I was super excited to find a great seitan version.",

    "text": "Spak Brothers has a lot of vegan & vegetarian options, which is what always brings me back. I usually order the Setian Pittsburgh Steak hoagie   & I haven't found another place that has a vegetarian sandwich quite like it. The seitan is thin sliced & piled high with peppers, onion, tomato, fries, eggs & mayo. The portions are huge but I usually get a 12 inch anyway to have lunch for the next day. They have a vegan version that doesn't have egg & has vegan cheese on it. Not a huge fan of vegan cheeses myself, but the vegans that I know really enjoy it. There aren't many places a vegan can find fatty foods like cheese fries, pizza & wings, so spak is a good place to go if you're looking to indulge. I usually just go in to order because they are always packed & sometimes if you call you'll be on hold for a long time. They have about 10 seats inside, so probably not the best place to go with a big group unless you want to eat on the large bench beside the shop.",

Because the only way I can explain the devotion of a certain demographic to this place is through a blind, unquestioning loyalty to a pizza-deity that can neither be seen nor proven. You must just accept this pizza as your higher being, and thou shalt not commit heresy against almighty Spak.  In seriousness - we called in a large pizza on a Saturday afternoon, and were told we had a 45 minute wait. I've never had a single pizza take more than 15-25 minutes to be ready in Pittsburgh. But whatever, it wasn't a big deal. However, when we got our \"large\" pizza, we were completely disappointed. I wish I had measured it, but my girlfriend and I ate the whole thing within 30 minutes (I don't think a \"large\" pizza should be easily consumed by two pretty small people?). I would estimate it was 12, maybe 13 inches in diameter. Without exaggeration, this was THE most boring, plain, safe, uninteresting pizza I've ever had. It was as if the cook followed the beginners' guide to pizza recipe, or heating up a frozen pizza. No character at all, no flavor, boring boring boring.   I don't understand the love for this place. I guess if you are vegan it's a nice convenience to have. If you don't have dietary restrictions - there are SO many better pizza places in the city. Don't just blindly bow down at the hipster alter of Spak. Have you ever seen a mom-and-pop pizza joint with their own bumper stickers, let alone see one in the wild? Drive through the East-End and every other Subaru will be adorned with the proud badge of Spak Brothers pizza, on their way to get communion...just don't forget your donation money for the good pizza lord.",

I would go out of my way to get it, really, we live over an hour away. .  - until yesterday that is.  I called to place an order for 2 Pittsburgh seitan steak hoagies and an order of seitan wings to go. The lady on the other end of the phone tells me its going to be over $36 .  I hung up, perplexed at this absurd total my husband and I came to discover that Spak brothers has raised their prices by about 40% ??!!  Naturally we called back immediately and canceled that order.  What a huge disappointment this business has turned out to be.  The price on the wings has doubled too. In this day and age people talk, leave reviews ect and I guarantee they will lose a lot more customers beside my husband and I due to this insane price hike.   Maybe its all the Californians moving into the ghettos of pittsburgh, desperately trying to gentrify these miserable little crud hole sub divisions of Yinzerville, - these Google types have a tendency to ruin everything their domicile's come into close contact with. .  That's why everyone's rent is sky high now.   Makes sense that spak may hike their prices up to appease the bearded yuppies, hipsters, and man- bun types who love to pay west coast prices for a silly little vegan sandwich in \"Da Ghetto\" .  Sad. Best of luck spak. But you lost business and not just mine, that I guarantee.",

The place itself is pretty small with some art on the walls and one or two video games along the other wall. There was music playing and the people working there were kind of jamming to it and that was cool.  The pizza was so good! Even the crust wasn't too crispy and chewy enough. My pizza wasn't greasy and my bread sticks were soft. The marinara sauce that came with the bread sticks came in two small containers. It was equally as delicious. I was surprised because many times I've come across gross sauce. I'm hooked!",

Calling ahead at 5:30pm, we were given an estimate of 20 min., which wasn't too bad and worked out perfectly for us, given the location of my apt.  We showed up at 6pm, and our order was ready for us upon arrival, so after paying, we headed back to my place to consume the goods.  Our order consisted of a medium (14\") pepperoni and ricotta pizza and an order of honey mustard seitan wings ($20 together).  The seitan wings were quite good--the best I've had, though I've only had them at one other place in PGH--and the honey mustard sauce was delicious.  The pizza was delicious--in fact, I'd say it was some of the best pizza I've had in PGH, and I've tried many pizza places to date, as can be seen from my pizza list.  While the crust wasn't perfectly crispy the way I like it, it did have some crispness, and I particularly liked the flavor and consistency of the dough once I bit into it.  The toppings were flavorful and well proportioned, and worked well together, despite my doubts that they might be odd together.  My friend was impressed with the wings and pizza, as well, confirming my impressions.  Overall, I'd say that Spak Bros. lived up to its reputation.  A couple of friends of mine who enjoyed Spak and recommended it commented that they don't feel hipster enough when they walk in to pick up their order, and I saw what they mean, since my friend and I definitely looked square compared to all of the employees and other customers.  Even if you're as un-hipster as us, I'd recommend stopping by, since Spak undoubtedly has some of the best pizza in PGH.",

My first foray into the various vegan options was the seitan buffalo wings with vegan ranch. I'm telling you, these cruelty-free wings will satisfy plant-based dieters and carnivores alike. And the serving size is very generous - I typically stuff myself silly and then have extras for leftovers. That vegan ranch...so good I feel like I could drink it (I haven't...yet).  I also enjoy the seitan shaved \"meat\" melt hoagies. Again, filling and delicious. You can make your sandwich fully vegan by substituting vegan cheese instead of dairy cheese.  And if the wings and hoagies aren't enough, Spak also has pizza with vegan cheese, sausage, &  pepperoni. My fav is the sausage.  Keep in mind, Spak can get SUPER busy. Best to call ahead and place your order for pick-up. Sometimes if they are REALLY busy, they can't answer the phone. Wait 5 minutes and call back, believe me, it's worth it. They don't deliver unfortunately :(",

The pizza and hoagies that I've had are always delicious, and I find myself returning to this little shop when I'm in Bloomfield. For me personally, I find it best to order and take my food to go. The shop doesn't offer much seating for customers dining in, but it does offer some neat old-school arcade games to occupy your time while you wait for your order.    One aspect that I believe could be improved is the checkout/order counter. A more modern and efficient cash register system could help to alleviate the constant struggle I noticed during my latest visit. Tasking one employee with over the phone orders, in-person orders, and processing payments resulted in a large line of customers waiting in the already crammed pizza shop.",

In the midst of construction alley in Garfield, you'll find Spak in all its pinball glory. I've tried the pizza twice at this location, and it is undoubtedly better with a topping. The plain cheese seemed a little dry, but not a bad pie. Overall, the pizza gives a good deal amount of cheese and a crisp crust that would satisfy most's pizza cravings.  But what's really great about Spak is their sandwich and vegetarian (specifically seitan) creations! My boyfriend is a strict carnivore and buffalo wing connoisseur, but for him to enjoy seitan wings and then ask for seconds definitely means that Spak is on to something. We've tried both buffalo and garlic parmesan, but they come in just about every flavor you could ask for.  Make sure you put your order in before stopping by to avoid the hectic wait.",

Great musical selections and lots of stuff to look at (and pinball to play). But nothing about this rates a five-star on its own.  But - I can only imagine that the folks giving Spak five stars are inexperienced pizza eaters, are faux-punks shilling for their 'hood, or the pizza is truly terrible in the 'Burgh (not True). Giving your hood love, I get that. Interesting things like seitan wings and vegan cheesesteaks are cool to have on offer. But once you're past the cool factor...Spak ends up middle-of-the-road.  Chalking this up as another one of those, \"But, this is so well-reviewed on Yelp!\" - can't trust everything you read on the internet - experiences.",

The pizza is okay, cheap mostly, but okay as well.  The sandwiches are gigantic and generally a frightening portion size.  I keep going back for the wings.  I suggest you do the same.  Also, call ahead and do it take out, unless you like listening to punk rock and eating off a pac-man machine.",

I had some offered to me for free last night and I couldn't even finish the slice.   the crust is wan with a mealy crumb, the sauce is too sweet and the cheese has this disturbing thinly viscous texture that I can only describe as being similar to the cheese you get on frozen kosher pizza. maybe they use cheese with vegetarian rennet?  the philly cheese steak was about as good as you're gonna get in pittsburgh, though. meat was sliced thin and cooked w/ decent caramelization. not all crowded and steamed on the grill. so I'll give them an extra star for that.",

But getting back to those fries, I should mention that they are made by hand from sweet potatoes cut into chunks and deep fried - but not breaded or anything gross like that! Just straight up, fried, sweet potato goodness...they stay pretty neutral in the spice department, neither choosing the Dark Side of chipolte seasoning or the Light Side of cinnamon seasoning  - once again, just straight up sweet potato goodness. I've asked for them blackened - delicious; I've asked for them just barely swirlied in the frier - delicious. I just don't think you can go wrong at $2.47 for the most massive helping of sweet potato fries you've ever seen. And hey, I've been eating them so regularly that I decided to look up a study on the health benefits of sweet potatoes after different cooking methods; obviously, boiled is best, but frying comes out with more beta-carotene than in baking! What! Deal with it, get the sweet potato fries.",

    "text": "I'm really happy that Spak Brothers exists for all my veggie and vegan friends.  The other reviews here describe those delights well.  But as a hard core carnivore - I will speak for the meat.  After the Bloomfield Grown-up Puppet Cabaret (delicious!) my friends and I strolled down the block to Spak Brothers which I had been wanting to try for awhile.  We ordered an extra large double pepperoni and an order of beef tacos to take home.  My starving friend PK had a chicken parm sub immediately which he reported as terrific.    Now, take into account we were giddy from a puppet show but we loved the pizza and scarfed it down in record time!  Boyfriend lived in NYC for 7 years and grew up in Chicago so is VERY serious about pizza.  He liked it so much that we went back the NEXT DAY to get another pizza, this time half double pepperoni and half pepperoni and ricotta - YUM!    As an aficionado of mexican food (sadly missing in pittsburgh) I was excited to try the beef tacos.  I have it on good authority that a True Taco King lent his recipe to the Spak Bros so I had high expectations.  They fry their own shells which is great.  The format of the tacos however was in a \"kit\" which by the time we got them home was a mess (10 minute drive tops).  The beef was cold and stuck together with melted but now-cold cheese.  They come with salsa, sour cream, and lettuce all which were fine.  I wish the tacos were preassembled and made to pop in the mouth immediately or somehow temperature separated.  I added my own avocado at home and enjoyed the taste sensation very much.  Pretty darn good for Pittsburgh anyway and surprising to find in a pizza shop.  Try em out.  There are 3 per order for just under $6 and it's a good amount of food.  Boyfriend wanted to share tacos when we ordered the next day so I ordered 6 tacos.  When he made it back with two GIANT bags I realized they thought I was ordering 6 ORDERS of tacos.  That's right, 18 tacos AND an extra large pizza.  A good problem to have.  Party anyone?",

    "text": "Last night I got an email from Yelp with a picture of Spak Brothers Pizza in it. It looked good, so our plans of eating a dinner of string cheese dipped in canned chicken were pushed back to Friday. When we got into the shop, the first thing that struck me as appealing was the music. They had some good old fashioned American hardcore playing, which brought me back to high school. The cheesy bread sticks were very good and really made good use of their dough. The pizza itself was good enough, but not good enough to warrant our trip to the shop. The ambiance was cool. Old flyers from shows back when Laga was open and some local art on the walls gave it a nice touch. Best pizza in Lawrenceville? Maybe. Best pizza in the city? Definitely not. It's also important to note that phone calls take precedence over all else in the shop. While the cashier did politely excuse herself to answer the phone in the middle of us placing our order, it was a little hard to believe that one of the other six people working couldn't have taken the call instead of bagging fake meat for their vegan subs. The people that ordered after us had three phone calls during their order, so I guess I can't complain too much about just one interruption.",

    "text": "Spak Brothers recently opened on Penn Ave and brought a shining beacon of hope to the garfield/east lib/friendship area, serving up sexy slices in the flavors of omnivore, vegetarian, and even *vegan* pizza, hoagies, and wings. Hell, I even travel there all the way from lower Lawrenceville.   First of all, the decor is sparse - I mean, wicked sparse, with a pinball machine, a tabletop arcade machine, and a couple of stools lining the walls. If you require more than that to pick up pizza, you might be in the wrong place. Lacking a tip jar, I heard that the pinball machine IS the tip jar. Stock up on credits for the staff before you leave. Really, though, you should eat on the sidewalk outside with the rest of the bike punx, or take the pizza & wings to a friend's house for a pizza party! The service is friendly and swift. Every time I have been there, the counter staff have all smiled, cracked jokes, and proved to be remarkably efficient at handling my special orders and inane lines of questions. There's a pretty good chance of a Spak Brother taking your order himself. That's charming.   The menu itself is an inspiration and a delight in Pittsburgh's pizza scene. Homemade delicious seitan can be served up in the form of wings or delicious hoagies, in something like 4 flavors (3 of which are vegan). You can order pizzas with a variety of veggie meats - ask what they have in stock to avoid getting your heart broken. OH AND you can order pizza with vegan cheese! Like all vegan cheeses, it falls short of the real deal, but honestly, if you are a hungry vegan in need of a giant cheap pizza to get you through band practice - well, I've heard that Spak is your Lord & Saviour. Note: vegan cheese pizza is best consumed hot. The vegan cheese turns to some kind of alien form after it gets cold. Tastes the same, weird mouthfeel, no fault of the Spaks.   Be prepared to wait a few minutes for your food - the wait is reasonable, but they are actually cooking your food in their gigantic ovens, not just re-heating some frozen pizza back there. Watch a Spak toss some pizza dough. Play some pinball. It's good for your soul.   412-362-SPAK (7725)",

They also have a variety of colas (grape, cherry, ginger, root beer, Pennsylvania Punch) to sip on too.  The service is walk up and there are a handful of bar stools around the room if you want to eat in.

The crust was crisp and a little chewy...a nice homemade flavor to it as well. I could stand a little more sauce on it, but it was very good.

My friends and I planned to watch Tim Burton's Batman (1989) one friday night and got some Spak Brothers to accompany it after we found out that Little Chicago's in the Southside was closed :(. Anyway, it was a great rebound from that tough loss. We ordered some garlic seitan wings which were a little too crunchy but still phenomenally delicious along with an extra large pizza pie with mushrooms and vegetarian sausage. The pizza was out of this world. Plus, where else are you going to find a pizza place that has vegetarian meat toppings? Extra points for it being in walking distance too.",

Stop reading this review and just go. Now.   Upon walking in Spak Brothers looks like your classic takeaway joint. A few chairs and a drink cooler. Place your order at the counter and wait for approximately twenty minutes. During that time admire the artwork on the walls and the community events that are posted. But when your order is ready?  Prepare to be wowed. I ordered a vegan cheesesteak w/ vegan mayo, but held the cheese. My first reaction was that I couldn't believe it was vegan. We've all been there. We get stoked for our \"seiten whatever\" and when it arrives it's blocks of dry deep fried cardboard. Not here. This is insanely great. It's go-back-to-the-counter-to-double-check-if-it's-vegan great.  My only complaint was that I didn't get a larger size. I'll be back and when I do...I'm bringing all of my non-vegan friends to try it. This will make a believer out of anyone.  For the partners out there that aren't vegan that take their partners who are - you'll be the winner tonight. Just sayin.",

Many locals and many phone-in orders. ****Phone in your order and pick it up. We ordered the seitan wings and 12'' seitan cheese steak and waited 15 minutes.   1. Seitan wings ($5.85): Very crispy and moist on the inside. Had buffalo and vegan ranch (extra $$) sauce on the side. Came with 2 piece of celery sticks. It was pretty tasty for fake meat, wasn't as hard as other places with seitan options.   2. Seitan cheese steak 12'': Very tasty with the grilled onions and peppers. Loved the flavours combining with the cheese. Wish there was a bit more vegan mayo (extra$$) tho. The seitan meat was thinly sliced and pretty moist. We even ordered  second one to go!   Overall, great choice selections, huge portion, great price, ORDER THROUGH THE PHONE.",

On some nights, it is easily 5-stars; other nights, it's insanely 2-stars. So I'll come somewhere in the middle.  The thing about Spak Bros. is that when it's good - it's damned good. Especially for vegetarians and vegans; Spak has some of the best seitan in the area, whether you go with the wings, or the Pittsburgh Seitan Hoagie. They also offer dairy-free cheese; but the sauce and crust is so good there, that we sometimes opt just getting no cheese at all, and just a ton of veggies on a pizza. The possibilities are endless.  However, there are also some nights when it's near impossible to place an order, even on the phone. And sometimes on those busy nights, when the wait time can be over 2 hours, things can still get overcooked and taste a little on the burnt side.   We tend to be endlessly forgiving with Spak, because it's one of the only places to get vegan pizza, wings, hoagies, etc.; along with Jamaica's Finest Ginger Beer in the cooler. Though it can sometimes be frustrating just to place an order, it's still worth it, and we always come back for more.",

I finally found the opportunity this past Sunday when I was in the area running errands and was looking for a late lunch to pick up and take home. I ordered a large vegan seitan steak sandwich, as well as seitan honey barbecue wings with vegan ranch. Order took less than 30 minutes to prepare and cost under $20. My boyfriend and I split the order and were both impressed. The sandwich was my favorite out of the two orders. Although the seitan doesn't taste exactly like steak (not that I expect it to), it was SO good and flavorful. The bread was tasty and the toppings were great. I did add some red onion at home, which made it taste even better. The seitan wings were good, although really chewy. Still, the sauce and the flavor was perfect. The vegan ranch was really tasty as well! Overall, I loved this place and can't wait to return to try their pizza next time!",

When I went to ask the cashier about the order, he just said  \"we'll let you know when it's ready,\" and I said \"ok, because I placed my order before 6p, and he said \"we'll let you know when it's ready.\"  I'm thinking, I probably should just refund my order. A few min later there was a man who received his order and was told from the cashier \"sorry for the wait, we gave you a partial refund on your order.\" I'm thinking I hope I receive the same. Unfortunately I wasn't offered an apology nor a partial refund. I've worked in food and customer for a long time, I get both sides of the spectrum, however this was not good service and my mom's food was charred. See photo.",

The cheese never really melts all the way and they screw up the topping request most of the time.  The seitan \"wings\" are tasty...but I would just call them seitan meat blobs, because that's what they are...tasty though.  The philly cheesesteak with seitan is actually pretty damn good, BUT the seitan to bread ratio is absolutely pathetic...it definitely needs at least double the seitan to be able to be called a philly cheesesteak.  I would rate it higher if it weren't for the staff.  They basically never answer the phone, which requires going into Lawrenceville and standing in line to order.  I've been there even when NO ONE was in there and they still basically refused to answer the phone as it rang.  I'm definitely not cool enough for Lawrenceville, so it's always a god damned nightmare any time I have to head down there.  Add more seitan to your cheesesteaks, upgrade the vegan cheese, and answer the phone... then this place would be killer.",

Their pizzas are classic and just what you'd expect, with tons of vegan fixins including daiya cheese, soy 'meats', and endless toppings. By far they make the most delicious seitan hoagie in the city limits. The seitan is made in-house, and on the hoagies sliced very thin, piled on top of fresh toasted bread with grilled peppers, onions, etc. The Seitan \"Steak\" is the best with fresh lettuce, tomato, and vegenaise, just oozing with flavor. Their offering is quite large, everything from specialty pizza, custom pizza, salads, calzones, breadsticks, fries, seitan wings, regular wings, etc. The BBQ & honey mustard seitan wings are the vegan options, and they also make a vegan buffalo sauce & vegan ranch (talk about fresh dill!) which is soooo bomb. Everything that's vegan is clearly marked. Just be sure to specify when ordering vegan! I accidentally got a pizza with all the vegan \"meats\" and regular cheese--that was my bad. They draw quite a crowd so be prepared to wait for your order...but trust me, it's worth it!",

For $8.88, I ended up with three meals out of the hoagie.  The meat was delicious with no fat pieces, and there was the perfect balance and combination of toppings.  I also ordered a slice of cheese pizza for $1.87, and that was delicious as well.  The amount of food you get for the price is amazing.  And to top it all off, they have a thousand vegan options?  I can't wait to come back and try the vegan options too!  The service was efficent, and there are 2 pinball tables at $.75/game to play while you wait for food.  This is definitley a take-out establishment.  Credit cards accepted!",

IF you can get thru to them to place an order, (once I was super desperate for their wings and waited for over 10 minutes on hold and gave up before I got through) the timing they give you has been consistently way off-- i.e. under estimating the wait by at least 20 minutes! The food is still okay, but much pricier than before.  I think the general crappy service and price surge has somewhat turned me off of Spak for awhile.  Maybe I'll try again in a few months... Bottom line--if you're calling to order, be prepared to wait awhile on hold to place your order; if they take your order in less than 5 minutes, it'll be a happy surprise!!!",

Also as a lot of people say, it's so annoying to wait on hold for at least 15 minutes each time I call, no matter what time of day. Once my husband waited in line, not kidding, for 40 minutes to pick up an order that was already ready. The cashier just abandoned her station and started filling orders while he waited at the counter. He is a patient man, I would have flipped out and left! Nevertheless we stomach the poor service because we like the food. Just wondering: if people complain so much about your service, I wonder, maybe you guys can work on improving your service? Seems like it would be good for business, call me crazy.",

I had the Pittsburgh cheesesteak which wasn't anything like the cheesesteaks I had when I used to live in Philly, not that I really expected it to be in Pittsburgh.  But the meat was kind of dry with no flavor.  However, it was HUGE and fairly cheap for what you get.  It was supposed to come with mayo which I declined and it came with fries inside the sandwich.  I realize this is a Pittsburgh thing but fries really don't belong INSIDE a cheesesteak.  I ordered the sandwich to go (there isn't a lot of indoor seating) and it took awhile for a simple sandwich when there was only one other person waiting.  However, I did enjoy playing the pinball machines while I waited.  I'm not really sure what all the hype is about this place, but maybe their other sandwiches are better.  They do have some interesting vegetarian/vegan options (like a Seitan cheesesteak) that may appeal to some people that would be hard to find elsewhere.",

My friend and I walked up to this place one weekend night, on a whim, mostly drawn in by our curiosity to try the famous seitan wings. It was a good choice! We ordered and ate at the counter. We shared a 14\" spinach + feta pizza. The toppings were fresh and the crust was hand tossed, not too thick nor too thin. A classic handmade pizza.   We also split an order of the wings, of course. They were fine, not as exciting as I had hoped - I feel that I've had equally good or better vegan junk food elsewhere. (Then again I've had vegan disasters too, and these were far, far above that!) We had ours with buffalo hot sauce, served with celery and blue cheese for maximum authenticity; spicy and greasy as hell. They may be vegan (well, sans cheese) but healthy? Hmmm....",

I can't tell you how many places don't do this - the majority, actually - and this pizza was amazing.

The quality of pizza is mediocre at best- the crust is flavorless, the cheese bland, and the ingredients used sparingly. For the price of their pizzas I would expect something better but they have simply not delivered. Another issue is their menu, which doesn't offer any kind of specialty pizza whatsoever.   Overall, Spak brothers is too pricey for too mediocre of a pizza that doesn't even deliver.

In addition to their vegan options, everything else i've tried has been great. The crust is always super crispy on the bottom and their buffalo chicken pizza with ranch is savory and delicious. If you're ever in the area check them out and take your pizza outside the storefront to enjoy it on the benches!",

It's a vegetarian friendly meat substitute and as someone who doesn't eat beef or pork, this piqued my curiosity. It tasted like something I never knew I was missing and immediately made me Google Seitan. It was filling, flavorful, and even the fries inside of the Seitan Pittsburgh sub made me feel like I was in the right place. The sub did fall a part by the end of the experience but the best ones do as it was greasy and it was just an entire meal sandwiched between two pieces of bread. It was the texture of meat without being meat and my mind is blown! It was impossible for this not to taste great as Spak knows their flavors.",

Everyone has been telling me to check out this place for a while but I'm usually not in that area. MAN I wish I would have found this place earlier. Incredible seitan, they shred it and cook it to perfection. It's definitely not a place to sit down, especially in the summer because the restaurant gets super hot. I am going back as soon as possible tbh to try out whatever else they have that's vegetarian. Good food, good price, good portions. Please take the time to visit this place especially if you're vegetarian.",

    "text": "I always leave a tip to hardworking staff, but after coming into this place, I couldn't bring myself to leave one. Came in here while passing through on Sunday (Mother's day) around 830pm. I've never been here before, so I asked the girl at the counter if there were any vegan options. She looked at me like I was an idiot and said \"Uh, yeah, we have a lot of vegan options\". Kinda with a \"no shit Sherlock\" tone of voice. I was taken aback, unsure of how to respond or if she was joking. I wanted to respond \"well how the fuck was I supposed to know?\", but I was really hungry and didn't want anyone to spit in my food, and plus this was the only place around open on a Sunday night.   Instead of showing me the menu and pointing out what was vegan, she continued looking annoyed that I was now wasting her time because I didn't have my order ready. There was no one else in the restaurant at this time, so it didn't really make sense that she was in a hurry. I think what she was in a hurry for was cracking jokes with her coworkers, because she seemed way more charismatic and friendly towards them than myself and any other customer that walked in while I was there.   Now, I do feel kind of bad for not tipping and for leaving this review, because the food was decent and the other employees there were working hard. However, I've never had such shitty customer service in a restaurant before, and I will not ever come back here or recommend this spot to anyone else. I'm a pretty easy going and understanding guy, but I've never left a restaurant feeling straight up angry before.",

The pizza is super tasty here.   The seitan cheesesteak is unbelievable. I couldn't fathom how it wasn't actually meat! They slice the seitan like thinly sliced steak and top it with vegan cheese, mayo and vegetables. It was super good. The seitan wings were really good too!  You gotta try this place if you're a vegan in Pittsburgh!",

I've been visiting Spak for over three years now and remain a loyal customer. They have THE BEST vegan wings out there. Huge fan. Their vegan ranch is also bomb and pairs well with the wings and salad. Seitan salads are usually my go-to, with delicious seitan, fries, vegan cheese, and some veggies thrown in there. Couldn't ask for anything better.   They also have amazing sandwiches. Buffalo seitan, bbq seitan, and vegan cheesesteak are all phenomenal. I can't pick my favorite. One thing they could add would be delivery as there are many times I don't feel like changing out of my lazy clothes, and then I realize it's so chill that no one cares what you look like.

    "text": "Let me start of saying that that upon arrival at 3:05ish, the place was already bustling. This was super encouraging for a small pizza joint that I was hitting up on my way to 376.   Drenched in hipster marinade, the interior was inviting. There's a bunch of rad artwork and memorabilia inside the place, including a pinball machine, a signed setlist from the band Hanson, and cultural artwork, representing sports, music, comics, and more. Despite the cozy and unique interior, seating is limited to a small bar and some stools situated around half of the perimeter, so if your party is larger than two, it may be best to dine at home.   But I'm not Martha Stewart, this isn't the good housekeeping forums, and you're here for the food review. The best slice of pizza I've had in Pittsburgh, bar none. Crispy crust, a good marinara, and melty cheese that has been cooked long enough to start developing those signature brown bubbles. The chicken parm hoagie and chicken tenders were similarly good. Nothing beats a good, fresh fried chicken in any form. The hoagie was made with garlic bread and the chicken, sauce, and cheese components did their job (though I would've fancied some more marinara on my hoagie). The sauces for the chicken tenders were good for me, but mom disliked the spice in the bbq and honey mustard (which both had the spice of a medium wing sauce). Keep in mind if you have someone averse to heat.  Overall great lunch experience. 4.5/5 (rounding up for the exceptional service we received, and the presence of my favorite soda, Cheerwine, in the fridge)",

I called on a Saturday night around 6:30, ordered a large pizza with hot sausage and banana peppers for pick up. The kind people on the other end of the phone line said it would be 20 minutes and $12, not bad at all.  Despite being very busy when I stopped in to pick up my pizza (there was a concert across the street) they had my pizza ready and waiting for me. This is where the story goes from overly pleased to \"Meh\". The pizza was just mediocre. The crust was very chewy and on the hard side. By the time the pizza cooled it was nearly impossible to bite through without really going at it. The sauce and toppings were also just OK.  Despite the service and the price being amazing, the pizza just wasn't good enough to warrent me going out of my way for it. This really bummed me out!!!",

So yeah, I got a small pizza (I don't believe they do slices for vegan cheese) with double spinach topping and it was sooo good that it didn't survive the walk to the bus stop.   For one somewhat hungry person, the 10\" SM pizza will do. Don't get the taco kit if the kitchen is busy (like during First Fridays/Unblurred events) because you'll see so many people get their food before you get this container of stale taco shells with a few lifeless shreds of lettuce in there.

That didn't happen.  The splitting part sort of did, but we ended up eating the whole thing and left nothing for leftovers.    The staff are super friendly and remind a little bit of Austin.  Thanks Spak for bringing a little spunk to the neighborhood!",

    "text": "$2 slices, local ingredients, and absolutely in the hood...it's pretty fabulous.  II will admit, I've always wondered what food came out of this very modest building in Garfield.  The only thing I'm wondering now is why I waited so long to try it?!  After reading the menu I decided since it was my first trip I'd go the route of pizza per recommendation of Pittsburgh magazine. I was not disappointed!   It's simple, the crust is excellent, they don't skimp on toppings (even though I just went with basic mushrooms this time...I will absolutely be more adventurous in the future!) and the service was friendly and polite.   I did spy some type of sub being cooked in the oven alongside my pizza...and there was a hefty portion of meat on that bun!  I can't wait to go back...great local spot!",

Best pizza in town in my opinion. If only they would go ahead and put gummy bear pizza on the menu I would want for nothing.",

    "text": "Spaks is located near where I work so it has become a lunchtime favorite. I try to stay as healthy as possible when lunching throughout the week because I know that when the weekend hits I'll be taking down some calorie inflating meals.  I first started ordering the salads. I would get the garden salad stocked full of tomato, cucumber, peppers, roasted chicken and an egg. Protein \"loco\" or \"loca\" cuz I'm a chick! The chicken is very tender and juicy, the egg when added to the salad is sunny side fried? A little strange but doable. Now the greens I have a problem with! Romain would make such a difference. They get the standard mixed greens but at times it can be pretty bitter. Too much \"octopus\" lettuce that is hard to chew. The last time I ordered the salad was greasy from the egg and I can't get it anymore.  One of the reasons we order from Spaks is because the Dr. at  my practice is super strict about her diet and enjoys the vegan friendly choices. Faux pepperoni, cheese, wings, and seitan. I've tried them all and they are scrumptious! Now when we order I get the seitan melt. Not the salad option that I prefer but until I can get some Romain it will do. Ok it's better than \"it will do\" Soft buttery bread with all the veggie fixings I require. I think I just feel guilty because of the high carb count in the bread.   The pizza is also well made, one of the best in Pitt. Of course the most outstanding item on the menu is the seitan wings, spicy and crunchy just how I like them!",

That said, if they delivered I'd probably be ordering it every other day, so the lack of delivery is actually probably a good thing.  This is not my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh (I think Pizza Sola in Oakland is far superior in overall flavor/consistency/essence-of-pizza-ness).  But it is a close second out of those I have tried.  The pizza is thin, a la New York style, although I would say not as greasy.  The thing that makes this place extra special, though, is the veg- and vegan-friendliness of their menu.  In addition to pizza, they have great vegan wings (although the Buffalo sauce is not vegan) and a bunch of traditional sub-style sandwiches made with vegan and vegetarian alternatives.  What Spak does that no other place in PGH that I'm aware of does, is cater to those meat-like junk food cravings that vegetarians are occasionally susceptible to.  The pizza would be enough to keep us coming back, but the fact that they can fill my craving for Buffalo wings?  Awesome.  One thing to note: the shelf-life of some of the veg substitutions can be short.  If you have a long way to go to get home, consider eating there, or finding a nearby bench if the weather is nice.",

The dough is great, the sauce is great, and the toppings are fresh.  Spak seems to put a lot of effort in to the quality of the toppings.  I also get Italian hoagies from them.  I like my hoagie meat crispy on the edges and Spak delivers.  The buns are also excellent.  Overall a quality place.",

    "text": "Spak Brothers is some of my favorite food in all of Pittsburgh. This place is absolutely heaven for vegans! I always get an order of the seitan wings with vegan buffalo sauce and vegan ranch (get extra). The pizza is awesome! They have a wide variety of veg-friendly pizza toppings, including pepperoni, sausage, and daiya mozzarella and cheddar.   The first time I went here (with my husband and kids in tow), I didn't realize that there was very limited seating, so be prepared to take out. In warm weather, it gets very hot inside the restaurant due to the ovens, so you may not want to sit inside anyway. There are a couple of benches outside on the sidewalk that people sit at to eat. Also, sometimes there is a long wait time, so call early. We usually order and bring it home, pop it onto a pizza stone and heat it back up. Still delicious and worth the drive for us.  The service is always friendly and they are always happy to answer questions about toppings, ingredients, etc.  I always say that the next time, I will try one of their vegan sandwiches, but so far, I cannot give up the seitan wings and pizza. Just awesome food!!",

The pizza is nothing special,  each time the pies are underdone,  this is inspite of the insistence that they bake them well done.  I would expect that would not be a problem given the hour+ the pizza took (was quoted 25 -30 min).   The pizza overall I find bland, the notable exception was the peperoni,  a higher quality than average.  But that could not offset the below average balance of everything else, dough,  sauce,  cheese,  and most notably the service.   I guess the hipster millennial types flock for vegan fair?   .",

Here, they get that the triumvirate of pizza is a balance of crust, cheese, and a good sauce that blends with all the other flavors. If all really you want a giant pile of rubbery provolone, put on your mullet wig, hop in your IROC, and drive to Mineo's. Me? I need a slice I can fold.  I like the punk rock vibe, and they are all business. Got a vegan/vegetarian friend? Bring 'em along. I am not a vegetarian, but I will sometimes get the seitan wings just because they're so tasty.   They also have ginger beer, and pinball machines? What more do you want? Whack-a-mole?",

I have a milk allergy but would rather not be forced to eat exclusively vegan food, so after discovering that there is a pizza shop a few blocks from my house that serves vegan cheese with non-vegan toppings I had to try it. Their pizzas are priced by size, and you are free to choose whatever toppings you want at an extra charge. I felt the prices were extremely reasonable compared to some of the specialty vegan or allergy-free pizzerias in Pittsburgh. The pizza itself was amazing. It was piping hot and ready exactly when they said it would be, which is a huge plus in my book. I can't wait to become a regular here!",

We showed up about 30 minutes after the order, as they told us to, and ended up waiting almost an additional 15 minutes--which happens so no big deal. I'm giving it two stars because we really liked the breadsticks and the cheese on the pizza was great. However, the pizza was raw. The wax paper in the box had somehow melted into the pizza making it impossible to remove and parts of the pizza completely inedible. It tasted like we were eating a pizza that hadn't even been put in the oven yet. Really disappointed in this place, especially considering we could have gone to one of the ACTUAL good places around here like fioris or mineos and gotten more food for less money. Pretty mad we had to pay for food that was raw. It seems that they rushed to complete our order once we showed up to get the pizza. Had they just explained that they forgot and had us wait a little longer for a cooked pizza, we wouldn't have been upset at all. We won't be returning.",

I ordered a XL pepperoni for pickup and made my way to the location, it's a pretty cool shop in a up and coming part of town.  My first impression walking in was that everyone seemed friendly and working hard.  This place seemed to be doing very good business (probably because it is so cheap), but the first thing I noticed was a pungent oder of BO wafting through the air.  Now I'll admit it was a hot day, but it made me think twice about the cleanliness of the people making my pizza.  Regardless, I picked up my pizza and rolled out.    As I was making my way home, I took a look at the pie and was not that impressed as it looked super oily and blah.  I hoped it tasted better than it looked and while I'm no expert, I know a good pizza when I taste one and couldn't wait to try it.  Unfortunately, the look of the pizza mirrored the taste (as in not impressive).  It was very bland and nothing special.  After seeing all these great reviews maybe it was just my experience that wasn't up to par.  I'm no hater on places just to hate, but I'm honest and don't think this place was that great.    I really wanted to like this place, but I'll never eat here again.",

I won't go into the all details, because honestly nobody cares. But during an order with a very rude and agitated employee, I asked for an Italian sandwich, instead of informing me politely like a reasonable human being that they did not have that sandwich today, the gentleman on the phone repeatedly screamed \"no! No! No!\" At me to inform me that I could not have that sandwich. Being nice was difficult, but I obviously chose not to order anything from Spak that day and definitely won't again.  I know they have an image. They are all very cool people, but have massive chips on their shoulders. It would just be nice to see a little humility and maybe to have a reasonable conversation with management/ownership, because these actions towards customers are not few and far between.",
