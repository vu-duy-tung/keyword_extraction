    "text": "You never get a second chance to make a first impression.   Truer words have never been spoken. My family lives pretty much across the street from this establishment. For several years it stood empty. We carefully watched, hoping some restaurant would move in - preferably one that served alcohol.   When it became clear a business was moving into the building, we were thrilled. After months of watching renovations and wondering what was to come, the Roman Bistro finally opened. On Father's Day, my husband, daughter, and I headed over to enjoy a nice family dinner at our newest local restaurant.   I'll start with the positives. The beer list is amazing. Great selection. And the atmosphere is very attractive. As far as the food goes, it's not bad. It's nothing to write home about, but it's okay.  Here's where the critical aspects of this review kick in. After selecting our meals, including ziti for our two-year-old, we waited an inordinate amount of time for our food to arrive. Our waitress had seemingly disappeared. Empty drink glasses were not refilled. If it had been a busy night this would have been understandable. But it wasn't a busy night at all. About 2/3 of the tables sat empty.   Finally our waitress reappeared. She brought out a basket of cold and slightly stale bread and told us our food would be out soon. Then she dropped the bombshell: there was no ziti. Our 2-year-old's meal would not arrive with our meals. If you have a young child, you understand that can be a major issue. We asked for a mini pizza instead but the mini pizza would not be ready for about 20 minutes. Not good.  Our meals came out and as I fruitlessly tried to get my daughter to eat some of my trout with shallots (best of luck getting a toddler to eat that), I lamented not going to the more casual but consistently decent Drew's down the block.   Her pizza finally arrived about 15 minutes later. She enjoyed the pizza but it was too little, too late.   We left feeling shortchanged, having spent a good $75 with tip for a below-average experience. On our way out, we stopped in at the beer store to get a sampler - a six-pack for $33. The beer was fantastic and the prices probably reflect PA's archaic liquor laws more than anything else. But we were feeling none too jazzed about stopping in for another meal anytime soon.   Final verdict: We've been back for the occasional beer but never another meal. Maybe that's a mistake. But first impressions are everything and our first impression of the Roman Bistro left us decidedly unimpressed.",

    "text": "We went there for brunch and I had a pleasant time.  The furnishings and ambience were comfortable and there was plenty of room to move about. Service was decent but i think a few minor tweaks could really improve it. For instance, perhaps they are understaffed, but it wouldn't hurt for the server to at least make eye-contact or some kind of contact with the table so we aren't sitting there wondering what is going on.  But on to the more important stuff - the food. The brunch had a nice variety of options including an omelet bar, lots of breakfast sweet breads like cinnamon rolls, pancakes, french toast,etc.  Their smoked salmon was a nice touch and tasted fresh. Their lunch options were a bit more meager ... including linguini in a pesto sauce, baked fish, chili, and perogies. As we were there before 11 perhaps they change the brunch menu as the day progresses. Breakfast or lunch, the dessert selections were great.  I highly recommend the oreo rice-krispy treats and the chocolate chip cookies.  Also, the bacon and sausage were a step-up from traditional breakfast meats.  Either way, I thought it was a fair deal for $13 although I was a little surprised that coffee was additional but I liked that they didn't go crazy on the price.  Coffee was $2.  A few quibbles ...  Brew the coffee stronger - it looked like tea in the cup and one creamer turned it milk-like  Set the toaster to go a little darker - i realize that this could be difficult or that perhaps the user is to adjust it  Add a few lighter options, including more fruit, yogurt, etc.  I look forward to going again.",

    "text": "Thank you for the personal reply, Mr. Roman.   We came in for our usual once a week venture and sat at the bar. As I mentioned in the first review, I'm not a big fan of Dutch as my bartender. He was distracted, inattentive, and this time around, rude. I do not drink alcohol. I have a medical condition that keeps me from doing so.  He always treats me as a waste of a bar stool bc I do not order alcohol. My boyfriend ordered his beer, and I ordered my usual iced tea, to which Dutch sighed and not so quietly muttered, \"Figures.\"  Regardless of my reason for not drinking, it was rude and offensive.  I was so infuriated that he was openly passing judgment on me to my face. I wanted to leave then, but my boyfriend wanted to have dinner, drinks, and watch the baseball game.  We asked for menus. They never came. We asked again. He finally gave them to us, and never came back to check to see if we were ready.  I finally flagged him down to place an order to which he walked away and left the bar telling another bartender to take our order. When our food came out, the tortellacci sauce wasn't right. The pesto cream sauce had broken and separated into pesto and lumps on the bottom with a thick layer of oil and butter on top. I was surprised the front of house manager was allowing it to be served. We sent it back. It came back the same way. You and I both know when a sauce is broken, it needs to be 86ed or a new batch needs to be made.  When it came back the second time, we both called it a loss and shared the pizzette I had ordered.   Finally, I guess there was a problem with a patron at the other end of the bar, but we were unaware of it.  We heard raised voices and who I assume was the manager on duty, two male servers, and Dutch were surrounding a male patron and his guest.  The patron wasn't speaking in a raised voice but the manager was and it was causing a scene to which the manager said, \"Sir you have to leave, you're causing a scene!\"  Dutch loudly said, \"Sir, you are drunk! You need to leave!\"  If he was drunk, the bartender should have cut him off a while ago. Also, it just seemed inappropriate that you would tell an inebriated to get out when he could possibly get into a car and drive off.  I understand the nature of your establishment is a nice, friendly, classier place, but if the goal was to NOT cause a scene, the staff completely missed the mark.   I'm not saying we are never coming back. We just need a break.   ***************************** I really wish this place were more consistent. The food is either incredibly good or incredibly bad. There is no in between. We have been coming to this place since it opened because we live in the neighborhood and have sampled pretty much the entire menu with several repeat favorites.  The pastas are what are most inconsistent. From the texture of the pasta (over or under cooked) to the sauces (either the wrong sauce or what seems to be cold sauce from a jar), it's either spot on or a train wreck.  The sandwiches are the same story. The menu says they are built one way, but I have yet to have one served to me the way the menu declares it.  Example being the prime rib sandwich - the meat can be full of flavor or bland. It's supposed to have horseradish aioli on it. Mine had no trace of any aioli and I showed my server. They brought me a cup of it but then proceeded to charge me for it!  Unacceptable to be charged extra for an item that was left off of a sandwich that was advertised to have it included.    The service is the same as the food. Wonderful or awkward. Some of the staff are very nice and professional. Others are grossly inappropriate.  I once had a server in an effort to be friendly compliment my diamond earrings and presumptuously turn to my male companion and ask why he couldn't buy me a nice diamond ring to go with it ----- bc my companion was my brother for that meal, not my boyfriend!    I'd say just go there for drinks but even that is hit or miss. If you happen to get Billy, you are in good hands. If you get Dutch, just turn around and leave. You'll never get served or offered a refill bc he's too busy juggling bottles or texting someone.  And I have never had a good female bartender there. Another shining example of awkward service - a newer bartender (and I have not seen her since) over heard my boyfriend and I talking about his job. She asked if he also worked in the restaurant industry, and he said yes, he worked back of the house. She looked at him and said, \"Back of the house guys are all a**holes,\" and walked to the other end of the bar. It was obnoxious and unprofessional.   I guess I've had my fill of bad experiences there. Last night's meal was the straw that broke the camel's back which prompted this review. Both inconsistent/bad food and horrible service.   Sorry, Mr. Roman. I've met you and you're a nice man, but I hope you can fix your staff soon.",

    "text": "I have been to Roman Bistro a few times and I'm on their email list. Here are the things I have to say.   Pros 1. It's called Roman Bistro 33...why 33 because the have 33 beers on tap. Yeah that's 33 more beers than any other Bar in Forest Hills because there are literally no other bars in Forest Hills. Having said that 33 is a pretty good number for any bar.   2. Live music at least once a week. I like live music no matter what it is. Beats Muzak playing in the background.   3.Deals every day of the week, get on their mailing list and you can stay up to date.   4. Flat Breads yummmy........  Cons  1. The Cigar/Bottle Shop next door is weak. If I wanted to pay $5 for a cheap beer I would go to a bar in downtown. The cafe bottle shops at Giant Eagle beat the crap out of their bottle shop.  Conclusion It's a great place especially for being in Forest Hills. Give a try and I don't think you will be disappointed.",

    "text": "Love Roman Bistro! Hubby and I went for dinner last night. Reservations were at 6:15 but we arrived before 6 pm and were promptly seated. We took advantage of the half-off deal on some appetizers (offered before 6 pm) and ordered the bada bing shrimp. They were very tasty in a tangy sauce, plump and plentiful! I ordered the beet salad with lemon vinaigrette dressing. Delish! Warm bread with dipping oil accompanied the meal. Hubby ordered the short ribs and I ordered the lobster ravioli. Awhile later, the manager announced they were out of short ribs. Not wanting a further dinner delay, my husband ordered the ravioli as well. We loved the dish, always a favorite! We ordered the lemon cake for dessert. It was very flavorful, served with warm chocolate sauce and a dollop of whipped cream aside. Service was excellent, but was disappointed with the timeliness to mention the unavailability of short ribs. This popular gem is our frequent go-to place and they also are very accommodating to large groups as we have reserved for parties of 12-15 on several occasions. Highly recommend!",

Their staff seems to be out of sync.  Their bartenders are not very knowledgeable which makes me believe that they were friends of or related to the owners.    The Kitchen on the other hand is pretty phenomenal! I ordered a \"cigar\" flatbread and it was amazing! (half priced during happy hour) I have not tried the rest of the menu, but it is pretty unique for the area (forest hills) and rather gourmet compared to area restaurants.

Food finally came at 8:15pm, with the manager again apologizing and saying dessert would be free. My plate of ravioli was overflowing with a very watery cream sauce and it took more time to flag someone down to get it fixed. When it came back, it was good. But it took longer for anyone to check on us again or see if we wanted dessert, at which point we just wanted to leave. They did take my ravioli off the check instead of the free dessert, and I appreciate that. But after waiting 75 minutes for food, it's excruciating to have to wait around to be checked on, to get the check, and for someone to finally run the check. The two hour ordeal was not worth it.",

We had a roomy booth in the corner of the restaurant. The atmosphere was nice- not too loud or dark. Our waitress was fantastic. She could tell we had a sense of humor and wasn't afraid to bring that to the table and keep things entertaining. I got two peach Moscow mules, their special for the evening, which ran me $9 each. We all ordered appetizers to share and there were plenty to go around. I got a flatbread pizzette for my entree and it did not disappoint.  The one weird thing was they charged my friend $5 extra per glass of scotch to put it on ice. We asked and the waitress took it off, but just watch out.   Overall, delicious food and great service!

We were seated and I immediately noticed how chilly it was. We were waited on quickly by our waitress. She was nice. Although when I checked in on my Yelp app, I unlocked  dollar off a beverage coupon. She went and got the manager who seemed very confused saying she had never seen this before. But it is your offer? Anywho, we ordered drinks. The martinis were very good but very small. And they do have a huge selection of beer. So, we ordered a pretzel to start. It was huge and good. Nice app to share at the table. I ordered the Parma  chicken aka chicken parmesan minus the mushrooms. It was good. The gnocchi was really good! The chicken was a little overdone but not bad. The hubby ordered the gnocchi and sausage and enjoyed it immensely. Our friend ordered the butternut squash ravioli and enjoyed it saying it was very good. Our other friend offered the lasagna. First it didn't come out with the other three dinners and when it did and he got into the middle it was stone cold. He sent it back, not 5 minutes later it was back. The outside was hot the inside was still stone cold. Two different managers came to apologize. They asked if he would like a different meal and he went with the gnocchi and sausage. They offered him a free beer and he declined. They offered him a free dessert which he also declined. The portions here a huge. When they got the bill the only thing that wasn't on there was the lasagna, well it was on there and taken off. They even charged him for the beer he did have?! What? He couldn't even eat with us. They brought the beer up to our waitress and she reluctantly took it off their bill saying she had not been aware he was offered a free beer. Ummm then why were we visited by two different managers. And if you offer a free dessert and he chose not to take that, take the cost off a dessert off the bill. It was not the greatest customer service experience I have ever seen to say the least. And just a side note, the portions are big but you pay for them. Our bill which included two martinis, a beer (glass sizes  are small here), an app, and two dinners came to $86 not including tip.",

During the emotional opening of gifts (nurse graduation party), they loudly announced we had to pay a dollar per person for the cake we brought in. The money wasn't the issue, it was the way it was handled and how they later spoke to my cousin that was appalling. They were disrespectful and rude. Management tried to apologize at the end, but the damage was done, and our celebration was tarnished by their behavior. The wait staff was very good however. I wish we could review them separately.",

I spoke to a manager and then a banquet person. Not once did they say that there was a fee for bringing a cake, not once.   They interrupted my sister who was opening her gifts in front of my family to say that there would be a fee for bringing a cake. It was not about a fee, it was $1 per person. It was about not being told ahead of time and then being treated so rudely.  They treated me and spoke to me so disrespectfully and one man likened me bringing a cake to the party to bringing coffee to eat n park and then rolled his eyes at me. We had twenty people there, everyone ordering large meals. The way we were treated was absolutely disrespectful. It's a shame because the waiters/waitresses were sweet and delivered great service.   In the end chris took off our fee but I can promise we will never ever come back here again and if you are thinking about planning a family get-together I would refrain from doing so at this restaurant.",

The restaurant fills a much needed niche that's above the local fast food chains and diner located next door. The location is convenient to Forest Hills residences, and though often almost filled, the parking lot usually has at least a couple spaces remaining.  I personally enjoy the pizzettes. I have recently had both the Prosciutto E Arugula and Chicken & Artichoke, and both are very delicious. I also discovered last night that pizzettes are half off on Friday nights!  Roman Bistro has a nice amount of beers on tap, and I am often undecided between a couple beers. Their mixed drinks have always been tasty and worth the money. I have tried the Mango Mojito, Milky Way Martini, and Espresso Martini and would order all three drinks again.  I really like Roman Bistro and hope it's around for many years to come!",

Dinner the other night was with two kids and a mom...I ordered a pasta dish from their pasta night options. My boy had spaghetti and the others split some wings and fries. The waitress was attentive, the food was great, and the cost wax much less that I'd have thought. Nice touch was the free dessert for the birthday mom after a play at spin the wheel.

    "text": "We live in the neighborhood, so we are happy to see that a restaurant has sustained business for so long in this location and has very good food. We've always been a fan, but the last couple of times have been quite disappointing. The first time I noticed the service was not the same was a couple of months ago. I asked the server about an offer on Yelp, she said she would find out, and never came up with an answer. She mixed up several things we ordered and was not as knowledgable on the menu as one would expect. At first she seemed very annoyed with us, but toward the end for some reason she changed her tune and was pleasant.   The most recent time we were disappointed actually upset a whole group of our friends.   A smaller group met first for dinner, then later another handful of friends met everyone for drinks and to watch a basketball game. I asked what a specific drink was on the menu and neither of the bartenders knew what the drink was or what the ingredients were to it. So instead of making them flustered, I just ordered something else.   What really set us off was this. My husband ordered a beer and when the bartender opened it she said to him \"it's warm\" and handed it to him. He said that since she already opened it he was going to drink it. A man came over to him and said not to worry that he wouldn't be charged for the next one. When my husband ordered another beer, the man charged him for it and when my husband asked about it the man replied \"well you drank the first one\". Understand, but he said said we weren't going to be charged for the next.   Also, throughout the night there were about 20-25 people with our group. I would think that an establishment would be happy that many people were bringing money in. The bartenders seemed to be very irritated with us the whole night. Very cold, not attentive, and at some times quite rude.   We really like the food here, but if the service continues to be this way when we go, we will find elsewhere to spend our money.",

We did the $17/person brunch buffet which ends at 2pm. Their variety is good; you can find pretty much every brunch food staple and more. I had eggs, sausage, potato latkes, pancakes, cheesy potatoes, and a blueberry waffle. I wanted to try a lot more but sadly was too full after one plate and half a waffle. They also have salmon, veggies, and sweets (cupcakes, donuts, cookies, jello, cake pops, etc.) and an omelette and waffle bar where a friendly man will make you whatever you like. Mixed opinion on the food. I really enjoyed the potato latkes and my blueberry waffle, but the sausage was too fatty, the eggs tasted old, the pancake was stale, and the potatoes were way too cheesy. If I come back, I'll probably only get the potato latkes, a waffle, try an omelette, and skip most of the other food.   Taste | 3 Atmosphere | 3.5 Presentation | 3 Service | 3 OVERALL | 3",

Granted, our reservation was only for 8 people, but that's still a fairly large party for the lunchtime rush.  Our waitress, Angela, was superb!  Friendly and accommodating, Angela was prompt with refills on drinks, and checked on our table just the right amount of times.     As for the food, it was definitely above par.  This place far exceeds the quickie joints like Olive Garden, and the former Italian Oven.  There are a plethora of choices - sandwiches, salads, soups, pizza, pasta, chicken, fish, meats, desserts.  Our party ordered from various parts of the menu, and all came out as expected or better.  I had the butternut squash ravioli.  The ravioli were sweet, and tasted delicious, the cream sauce was light, and there were an adequate amount of veggies mixed in.  My partner had the fettuccine alfredo with shrimp.  The sauce was thick and creamy, and there was no skimping on the shrimp.  Oh, and the appetizer choices - so very unique!  We had the fried brussel sprouts with balsalmic glaze, gorgonzola, and walnuts  (they were more roasted/pan fryed - lightly - which I preferred - the outsides were all caramelized and crunchy - yum!), and greens and beans (these are vegetarian, btw.  Normally, veggie greens and beans aren't a thing at restaurants - at least the ones I've been to.).    Great place, clean environment, pleasant, fast service, yummy food - I'd say this place is definitely worth 5 stars in my book!",

The wedge salad is good. They can shed some more of the putter floppy leaves and serve a more traditional wedge. The blue cheese could be improved. They make very good sweet potato fries. The service is solid. Nice draft beer list. The wine list needs better additions. Entrees are slightly pricey for the offerings. Very lively setting. They need to turn off their loud music as this place is busy and loud on the weekends.",

The night that I went was during Pittsburgh Restaurant week so we decided to order off the special menu.  I got the crab and lobster Hozel, Chilean Sea Bass with mushroom risotto and broccolini, and cream brulee for dessert. The first course was delicious and the seafood was cooked perfectly and tender. I loved the presentation! It was served in a martini glass. The second course was good as well but there was some fatty areas on the sea bass that were not too pleasing for my palette. The worst was the dessert course. The cream brulee was rubbery and hard it took everything I had to eat it. Worse cream brulee I ever have eaten.  The service was good and the decor was nice. Liked how they had the bar area upfront and quite dinning area in the back. I saw they had a piano for live music which I wouldn't mind checking out.  Other then that disastrous dessert I am willing to give this place another try. Some of the other dishes that came out of the kitchen looked very yummy",

I was in town to visit family and it is so nice to have a good place to go close by without driving too far. It's a safe area - a nice parking lot fully lit and has great ambience!   Outside seating is available and it's done well.   I came by with my brother several times during the 2 weeks I was there. I like good beer and the local bars are mostly big brand beers like Bud and Coors types. This place must have 35 beer taps of really outstanding brews. The wine list is decent. Great bartenders - there's one guy Mr. Jacob that was well educated in all of the ales and food preparations they carry and delivered it with style. It worked out that we knew his parents - small world. I went to Catholic school with his mother - awesome family.   Later that week my whole family ate there for my Dad's 80th birthday. Everyone enjoyed their food, service was excellent and the wine we chose was delicious and was reasonably priced.   This is where the big wigs of Forest Hills go like Hal C. - the big deals are being made at the bar, the wheelers and dealers.   This is a True neighborhood gem that is well respected in Forest Hills!",

The Brunch is to the right and seating to the left.  There's a waffle and egg stationed, manned by a happy professional.  Sort of a lox and bagel area. Mini bagels were not good, very hard and unable to toast. The salmon was very tasty, but overall the station didn't quite work.   The hot foods were rather spectacular:  everything from pierogies to savory potatoes to moist meats.  Desserts were good.  Service was outstanding - we will definitely go back",

Every time I go to Bistro I tell myself that it I will never return but end up going back because I have a short memory. I have written only a couple reviews in my life but I felt compelled to get this in writing so I don't forget next time someone brings up the Bistro. The food is just down right bad and the service might be worse. I give it two stars because they have a strong beer selection and the salad I had was manageable. I ordered Chicken Marsala, which was $23, and looked like it came from a frozen dinner meal. The eggplant appetizer had no evidence of eggplant and had an odd spice to it that did not fit the obviously Italian style dish.",

Bonus points to them for having Chef JR on hand to prepare a freshly made omelettes and waffles.   Forest Hills has needed a local hang out like this for the longest time. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.   The atmosphere is cozy, and informal. It feels like a neighborhood pub -- hard to tell it used to be an abandoned car dealership!  My only complaint is more of a constructive suggestion. They offer a bloody Mary bar, with just a few scans options to garnish. Perhaps they could make it more of a focal point and offer things like bacon and shrimp.",

Of course, we had an idea, but could not provide an exact number.  It was a funeral, not a wedding or party with RSVPs.  We booked a few more than we thought would attend, to be safe.    We had 27 adults and a 2 year old.  We had booked for 30.  They charged us for the 30, but did not offer the extra meals we paid for to go.  They took all the food away immediately.  We did not have time to go for seconds if anyone was interested.    As I now see in other reviews, they charged $1.00 per person, including the 2 year old, for dessert.  I brought cookies already on a tray.  I think this was excessive to place trays of cookie on a table.    One of our attendees arrived earlier and ordered a Bloody Mary at the bar.  He was charged $9.00 for one drink, in Forest Hills!  The food was adequate (not great).  The staff was pleasant.  I do not think I would ever return.  The $28 to set out cookies left me with a very bad opinion of this business.  I am all for a business making a profit, but gouging customers is not acceptable.",

    "text": "I've been to Roman Bistro several times for Happy Hour.  They have a wonderful craft beer list and their appetizers have been pretty tasty.  Never have I stopped in for dinner.  After our experience, I may just stick to Happy Hours.  We had two separate servers asking us the same questions... at different times.  Weird.  Since it seemed busy, we ordered calamari.  I've had this in the past and thought it was decent.   Tonight it was absolutely flavorless.  The only flavor was in the dipping sauce.  No tossing in lemon or even salt.   Simply dry and dead.    Our entrees were the prime rib special and chicken artichoke picatta.  For $26 I expected more out of the prime rib.  Ordered medium/rare, it was overcooked and it just seemed lack luster.   My chicken artichoke dish comprised of overcooked pasta, bland chicken, and the inedible parts of artichoke.  Not worth the $20 ticket.  I would not recommend this dish.   When receiving our $86 bill, my jaw dropped a bit.  This meal was worth $40-50, not $86.    I give Roman's a 3 because I truly enjoy the bar and happy hour.  It just seems like it has a bit of an identity crisis - great beer, tvs, and bar atmosphere mixed with an overpriced, hoity toity back room.  It has Italian on the menu along with  bbq ribs, a Cuban sandwich, and coconut shrimp... those aren't even close to Italian.  It just doesn't work.  \"Do as the Roman's do\" is not the correct slogan for this venue.  Instead I'll grab a pint and leave with a smile.",

I tried to explain to her that no one was at the hostess station but she would have none of it.  After she walked away the waitress came by and gave me an additional scolding.  I was told the seats were reserved. I offered to leave since as an adult I am not used to being scolded.  After about five minutes of back and forth I decided to stay. I order food and beer and sat for about an hour. Of course no one came to claim the RESERVED table.  What a humiliating experience. I will not be back for Sunday brunch or happy hour.",

Not that they weren't friendly, but had to ask for everything (drink refills/silverware) and waited a long time for it. It is a shame because the atmosphere and food is amazing, so I would expect the servers to reflect the same.",

    "text": "I enjoy Italian food... a lot.  Rich melted cheeses, lasagna, pasta, red sauce and meatballs; what's not to like?  I had never heard of Roman Bistro on Ardmore Boulevard until today- apparently I've been out of the Italian-restaurant food loop for quite some time.    Roma Bistro is a large restaurant, with a seating capacity of 150.  Upon entry you can't help but notice the large bar stretches half the length of the front eating area.  Another, more private dining area is located past the bar, ideal for private gatherings.  The decor was modern Italian; large oversized tiles decorated the floors, and real linen napkins are used on the tables- snazzy.  We sat in a large booth next to the bar- a location that enabled us to keep an eye on things in the dining room.  Several large flat-screen TVs were hung throughout the facility... the owners must be sports fans.  Outside seating is available during the summer months.  A few moments after our drink orders were taken, our waitress served us large slices of doughy Italian bread and sun-dried tomato and olive tapenade.   The fluffy bread sopped up the rich mixture and creamy olive oil.  Delicious.  I started with a house salad with blue cheese to start.  The mixed greens were fresh, bitter, and sweet- a nice combination.  Yellow tomatoes, pickled yellow and red beets, shaved Parmesan cheese and red onions completed the flavorful mixture.  I ordered an arugula and prosciutto pizza, my dinner companions chose the baked lasagna, and cod sandwich- sans bun.   The pizza arrived in a non-traditional elongated rectangular shape.  The six-sliced pie looked appetizing.  In addition to the arugula and prosciutto, the surface was adorned with fresh slices of Roma tomatoes and fresh mozzarella.  As I took a bite of the pie I noticed that the crust was chewy, hard, and raw on top.  The dough itself lacked flavor, and didn't resemble any pizza dough I had ever had.  Luckily, the toppings were enjoyable- especially the spicy arugula.  The breaded cod was seasoned and properly cooked.  It came with sliced tomatoes, lemon, homemade coleslaw and tartar sauce.  The fish was fresh and flaky- the portion was large enough for two sandwiches.   The lasagna was prepared differently.  Two large strands of pasta were boiled, stuffed, and baked with sauce and cheese.  The sauce was tasty, and fresh.  The filling was equally as good, but unfortunately the rolled pasta that wasn't sauced was hard and unpalatable.  We shared some silky-smooth salted caramel ice cream for dessert with fresh cream and raspberries.  Roman Bistro is a quaint, family restaurant in a prime location.  With a few menu tweaks, and an improvement in basic cooking techniques, Roman Bistro could become on of Pittsburgh's premier Italian restaurants.",

    "text": "Roman Bistro is a welcome addition to Ardmore Blvd. I am happy to see more small businesses and coffee shops opening in Forest Hills.    I am conflicted about writing RB's review because each time that I have gone, I have had a completely different dining experience.  As a result, I'm giving it a \"middle of the road\" three stars.  Here's a brief summation of my trips.  They can be broken down to four types.   CASUAL PENS GAME RB has several game-day specials like half price wings (5$ for a half dozen jumbo wings and bread), $2 Miller Lights (meh.), and select discounts on drafts/wine.  Their wings are really good and huge to boot. RB has 33 drafts and more in their bottle shop.  Definitely a fun place to catch the game, but I've gotten a listless vibe from the bartenders on more than one occasion.  ROMANTIC-TYPE DINNER WITH BOYFRIEND Boyfriend and I used a coupon for a nice dinner one Friday evening.  Our waiter (this time) was very friendly, if slightly overwhelmed by the demands of his many tables.  For an appetizer, we ordered the Antipasto Plate with 'artisan cheeses and meats.\"  This couldn't be farther from the truth.  It looked and tasted like someone dumped their Giant Eagle deli selections on a plate.  Avoid.  The calamari with aioli was really delicious, however.  We also shared a bottle of red wine from their extensive wine list.  For entrees, I chose the lobster ravioli and boyfriend had the seafood special of they day.  We both enjoyed our meals but 1. they took a long time to get to us.  We were thinking of complaining when they finally arrived.  2. entrees are a la carte and I think for the price soup and/or salad would be appropriate inclusions.   BOTTLE SHOP I've frequented their bottle shop for beers as it's a convenient walk from where I live.  The prices are very reasonable (a bit cheaper than D's), but sometimes I stood at the bar forever until someone helped me with my purchase.    BRUNCH Only been once but aside from a few a la carte options, they also have an all you can eat brunch. A really tasty Sunday treat!   I go here often enough that I will amend my rating if the waitstaff becomes more consistent. Overall, service is really polar.  Roman Bistro has some fantastic staff who are friendly and knowledgeable.  But some of the others remind me of disaffected youth forced to do community service after committing a minor crime. I will be happy to give this place four stars after a few more positive dining experiences!",

The brunch I had a year or so ago was good but the best foods were not the italian foods. I was there for lunch a few times the last six months or so and it's steadily declining. The wait staff too is declining which is as important as the food. The last waitress (Kenya I think) was clearly tolerating having to wait on us. She wasn't openly hostile or rude but not exactly welcoming. I hope they can get their act together before it's too late.",

The location is convenient to most of my travels, but I never seemed to have the time to step inside to try it out.    Thanks to a trip into the city for a concert, I was able to plan some extra time to stop here for a pre-concert dinner and drinks.  Our entrance into the restaurant was met with a prompt and genuine greeting by the hostess. We mentioned that this was our first visit and she welcomed us, and offered several different seating options. I was very surprised to see how large the dining areas were and that they had multiple rooms to choose from.  Once seated, a cheery server came over to greet us and informed us of the drink and dinner specials for the evening.  In addition to their great sounding specials,  we were also told that most all of their appetizer and flatbreads were half-off and  they were offering various drink promotions during happy hour.  The appetizer and flatbread menu included many wonderful selections to try at a discount.  We placed our order and while we were waiting we were given a serving of their delicious oven-warmed bread and a dipping blend of seasoned olive oil.  Our order arrived within a sufficient amount of time, and everything looked great.  Our only concern was that the portions were quite generous and we might have over-ordered and would need to pack most of it to go.  We managed to sample a little of everything and had plenty left for another meal.  Based on my first visit, Roman Bistro is a place I would visit again and again.",

Already a little annoyed, we ordered an appetizer of cheese fries. Literally, these fries were at the soggiest thing that I've ever had. Have you ever left cereal in a bowl for a long period of time and then try to eat it? Yeah, exactly like that. Gross!  As for my meal, which took absolutely forever, we had a fish sandwich which wasn't bad. People in our party received their food at different times and some people's orders got screwed up. We were there so long, people in our party were discussing if they had sleeping bags in our cars in case we had to stay the night. My sister-in-law got up and left and took her kids home because it was already past their bedtime. There is just no call for being this unprepared as a restaurant. None.   The manager came over and offered us free dessert and free appetizers for the future but quite honestly I will not be back. I already gave away my free appetizer card. What a joke of a place.   Prediction:       This restaurant WILL fail. If you start to develop a reputation amongst people as scatterbrained and inconsistent, people will not stand for it. There are too many other options in the area which blow this place out of the water.",

    "text": "Before I begin this review, I want to let you know that I have given this restaurant the benefit of the doubt FIVE times, always leaving disappointed in some way.  Last night was the \"clincher\" -- I went with my husband and several friends for dinner.  I ordered the Cod Father (which was better THIS time -- last few times it had been way too spicy for a fish sandwich, in my opinion); my husband had the scallops (4 scallops and a small side of vegetables which he said were very good); our two friends ordered the lobster ravioli, also served with a small side of vegetables (they, too, thought their meals were good).  Putting aside the fact that I think the meals are way over-priced for what you get (i.e. very small portions) and that everything else is ala cart, we all enjoyed our evening.  Then came the bill fiasco.   My husband and I picked up the bill and were paying part with a credit card and part with a gift card we had received for Christmas 2013.  After 15 minutes the waiter came over to apologize for the delay but since our gift card was \"old\" they couldn't process it (apparently they just got a new computer program which couldn't  \"read\" the card).  He indicated that the manager was on the phone with the card company trying to figure out how to process the card.  I advised him to just put the entire bill on the credit card and give us a \"new\" gift card.   After another 10 minutes he came back and said \"are you sure you want me to charge this to your credit card -- we can wait until we reach someone and figure out your gift card?\"  I said no, we really needed to leave and just use my credit card.  After ANOTHER 5 minutes the manager came over and said that she was \"working on\" the gift card issue but really couldn't do anything until she reached someone at the gift card company.  We AGAIN asked that the bill be charged to my credit card and that she could reimburse us for the amount of the gift card.  Nope, she couldn't do that.  My husband finally told her to call the owner (which she must have done because it was no more than a minute or so later that she came over with our cash refund of the gift card).  During this entire fiasco (which took over 30 minutes) we were not offered a complimentary drink or desert (or even a piece of candy!) for our inconvenience.  What she did finally say was that we were welcome to come back again for a complimentary meal.  Having said that, we were not given anything to PROVE we could have a free meal, just her word.   In sum:  Food is good (but overpriced and small portions); Service: our waiter was very good (and extremely apologetic); the manager, in my opinion, seemed incompetent with respect to holding a \"managerial position\" and was certainly not concerned with resolving/satisfying a customer complaint.  I know this review is lengthy (now you know how WE felt waiting for our check!) but I wanted to be totally honest.",

It was crazy good and really a meal. My husband had the Caprese flatbread - very fresh and ripe tomatoes. Tonight I had the beans & greens, and was again impressed. Another small plate, but easily enough leftover for lunch tomorrow. Husband had the char-grilled wings with the garlic basil butter. That, too, was a small plate but these were \"real\" wings, not some sort of wing ding thing. Each was meaty and we took home three. God bless them for having some interesting, and fairly priced, wines to try! It's still very early in the going, but I think Roman Bistro is off to a great start!",

    "text": "A wonderful restaurant planted firmly on Ardmore, this Forest Hills Eatery was delightful inside and out. Ambiance was inviting, bar was comfortable and parking was ample. I had the pear and pecan salad with shrimp which was incredible. Warm grilled juicy shrimp were perfectly paired with the pecans and fresh pears. Gorgonzola would have been the preferred cheese to their feta, but oh well... it was wonderful. Service was questionable at best. My bartender was so caught up in other conversations, that the hostess had to come yell at her to take my order. At one point I had two oblivious bartenders staring at my empty glass of water, both failing miserably. It was pretty disappointing considering the food was so nice. Here's hoping they rectify the situation !  At least the food was worthy of 5 stars...",

We had a reservation for a large party, but couldn't be seated until at least half the party was there. I thought that was a little odd, since we had a reservation and the table was ready. There were plenty of open tables, were they going to seat someone in hours.  We were directed to the bench behind the piano as a waiting area.  They still have all this \"legalize marinara\" merchandise everywhere, and maybe I just don't get it. Marinara is already legal, it's just sauce. Do they mean it to be read as marijuana? It's just a little weird. Not bad, just weird.  I've had nice meals here, that are sometimes too salty. The bread and oils are great. The menu is extensive, perhaps too much so. I suspect, but don't know for sure, that the stuffed pastas and ravioli are not made on site.",

Good selection.  Got calamari and stuffed banana peppers for an appetizer. Watch those peppers - my mouth was on fire!!! A guy came in with his little girl and they put them right near us - not a big deal but I guess they don't have a problem with someone playing videos on their phone with the volume up.  I think it's inappropriate.  Anyways - got the ravioli three ways (lobster, butternut squash, and cheese).  Husband got the knocchi.  Both came with veggies.  All prefabbed from what I could tell.  Was a little disappointed in that.  Got carrot cake to go - also prefabbed.  We'll see what thats like later.  Stay posted.  Ok, just finished eating the cake - sorry folks, less than spectacular.  :(",

We visited opening night and had an enjoyable meal.  We have visited on several other times, especially for the live music they have at night.  They have a huge list of beers on tap!     Most recently I have dined twice for their Sunday brunch.  I highly recommend it!  They have a chef making omelets, waffles, and pancakes.  They have fresh eggs, eggs with veggies, delicious bacon and sausage, blintzes, and potatoes.  In addition they have some lunch options like fish, chichen, and linguini.  In addition to all that they also have a dessert bar and a bloody mary station.  Brunch only costs $13 which is a fantastic price for what you get.  Not the best food ever, but far from the worst.   All in all, good food and great atmosphere will keep us coming back to Roman Bistro!         On a side note, the commercial they have durings the Pens games are very cheesy and low quality.  They can probably improve their image by re-filming with higher quality cameras!  Latest visit May 5, after the marathon.",

    "text": "While we were happy to finally have what looked like a decent place in Forest Hills, we were skeptical about whether the new restaurant would compare to alternatives in Shadyside et al.  We were not disappointed.  The pork osso bucco is amazing, first of all.  It's both delicious (one of those meat dishes that's been cooked on the bone in some kind of savory sauce for a long time) and impressively presented.  We also had the calamari for an appetizer, which was not overcooked, too salty, or too greasy as fried calamari often can be.  I also thought the basil dipping sauce was something new.  The tiramisu looked amazing, but we were too full to try it - next time!  It was nice to see that they have a gluten free menu for friends with dietary concerns, or for the days when we're trying to be healthy :)  The beer and wine selection are both great with a wide range of prices and international selection.    The atmosphere is pleasant.  It's festive but not too loud, the tables aren't too close together, they have a number of TVs with sports around, and you can see the wine cave.  There's also a white grand piano near the entrance, haha.  We sat inside, but the patio looks nice.  We walked, but it looks like parking is easy enough.  The waitstaff needs further refining, but we expected that given that the place is new.  We could at least see that they were very eager to please and fix any errors.",

    "text": "I only went there once to watch a hockey game and here is what I can say about the place.  It looks very nice both inside and out.  I didn't eat anything there although the meals that came out around me were good.  I sat at the bar and when the game came on, they changed every TV in the place to the game (including the Penn St. Game that some people were watching).  There are roughly 12-15 TV in the bar area which is the front of the restaurant.  As I was there, I ordered a pumpkin beer.  Their beer selection was quite extensive.  They brought it in a small glass, which wasn't a big deal.  What was a big deal is when I found out the small glass of beer was $8.00.  I was very surprised by that because I know I can get a large 20 oz. bottle (bomber bottle) at other places for that price.  I have even paid $5-$6 for that same beer at other restaurants.  That's quite a lot for maybe a 12 oz. beer at best.  When I ordered a miller lite, it was 16oz and was only $3.00.  Much more reasonable.  I actually tried to get a reservation there on a Saturday night one time and when I called about a party of 6, they told me the only reservation they had was at 4:30.  I would definitely recommend planning long in advance if you want a larger party there.  I am actually hoping to go there another time to experience the food but will keep in mind the over priced bar menu when I go there.  The parking lot is somewhat small but about the right size because the restaurant isn't as large as it appears.",

    "text": "DONT EAT HERE! I  ventured into this restaurant last week, after seeing a fresh fish sign. This couldn't be further from the truth!!  When I first walked into this restaurant, there was no one to seat me so I had to seat myself after five minutes of standing in the lobby area waiting for someone to sets me. I then waited another 10 or 15 minutes for a waitress. When I finally had a waitress come over, I ordered the swordfish. When my swordfish came out 45 minutes later , the stench of the swordfish consumed the restaurant. The fish was spoiled!  I couldn't believe it. I told the waitress to take it back immediately !! There were five women that were sitting at the table in front on me and they all turned around and said \"oh my god what stinks?. I told them it was the spoiled swordfish!! I called the waitress over again and asked to speak with the manager. A  young inexperienced girl came over to my table  table, and I let her know what happened. I asked her if she is going to she is going to take care of the bill. She said she would take care of that bill but nothing else. I told her that I already waited 45 minutes for my meal I had to seat myself and now I'm starving and she's not going to comp what I wanted to order. She said she was new and after talking to her for several minutes she finally decided to go ahead and take care of the bill.

    "text": "This review is the culmination of two visits where I ordered the following:  1. Proscuitto e Arugula Pizzette & Bistro Burger  2. Caprese Salad and Chicken Saltimbocca  Service: Adequate. Basically did what they were supposed to. I went at very off peak times so they were not busy, but on both occasions I was both seated and served quickly and my glass was refilled when needed.  Food:  Pizzette - way too doughy for me. I was informed before ordering it was not a traditional flatbread so I was not expecting that, but I also was not expecting something that more resembled deep-dish or a loaf of bread. Toppings were virtually non-existent. 1 small slice of tomato on each piece, and maybe one slice each of mozzarella and proscuitto spread out over the entire dish. For $12 me thinks not.   Bistro Burger (ordered medium) - My impression was this was one of the those previously frozen burger patties from Costco, or at least it looked and tasted exactly like I remember them. Overcooked slightly but on these type of burger patties that's kind of hard not to do frtom personal experience. The pork belly was clearly cooked days earlier and just pulled out for the burger. Again, for $12 me thinks not. I can pay the same at Burgatory or Wingharts or any other host of places and not get a frozen pattie in the process, plus they are larger.   Caprese Salad - Fine, what it was supposed to be.   Saltimbocca - Pretty good. Probably the most enjoyable thing I ordered. Though not something I would make a special trip for. A little on the salty side as they probably season the chicken breast even though they are placing a very salty piece of prosciutto on it.   The bottom line is the meal prices just don't jive with either the portion sizes or the quality of ingredients. You can easily charge $12 for a burger...just not a frozen patty one. If I wanted that I would go to Wendy's and pay 1/4 of that.   The biggest beef (no pun intended) I have with the place, are shady business practices. I purchased 2 DoubleTakeDeal vouchers good for $40 worth of casual dining.   On my first visit, which was a Friday afternoon, this process was executed flawlessly as I pulled the voucher up on my phone and the served recorded the number and applied it to my bill.   My schedule allowed me to return the following day, Saturday, for lunch as well. Here I was told these vouchers are not permitted to be used on Friday's and Saturday's. I responded that was odd since I had done that very thing just the day before without incident and without any mention of said policy to not honor these certificates on Friday's and Saturday's. Just as importantly, I commented this stipulation is listed no where on the voucher or on the DoubleTakeDeals page. As such, by law they should be required to honor the certificate. They chose not too. If it were my mistake and I simply did not read thoroughly that's on me, but this was not the case in this situation. I just have no patience for business practices like this, particularly as a small business owner myself. If it were me, even if it did say it wasn't valid then, I would have made an exception and honored it for the day as a good faith gesture considering someone took time out of there day to drive to my establishment and had already sat down to order. Particularly on a day were my restaurant had maybe 15 people in it.   I've already requested a refund from DoubleTakeDeals for my remaining voucher and hopefully never have to return to this place. I can see why the reviews are what they are.",

I asked for medium well and it was bloody. I have to say the parking is wonderful and the decor is very nice but when you walk in from the outside, they have some kind of potpourri in the entrance area that is way too strong smelling. You expect to get an aroma of good food but this potpourri ruins any chance of that. It is a bad smell and should be removed. Another negative is the noise in the front room bar area. Way too noisy if you want to have a nice dinner and conversation. Ask to be seated in the back if you want to hear yourself talk. Also it's a little pricey for forest hills. And they need to offer more domestic beers. Too many fancy beers. They really need to serve Budweiser. I have seen people leave when they hear there is no Bud.",

    "text": "I went into Roman Bistro with an open mind. I'm always interested in trying new independent restaurants in my area. We had a party of four on an April Friday night with reservations. We were about 15mins late for our reservations and they called to make sure we were still coming which was nice. The wait wasn't too long after we got there and was seated in the back room. Our waiter seemed shy and new on the job. We couldn't hear what he was saying and seemed to bounce around a lot. I ordered the Veal Parmesan as I was interested in trying an entree rather than my usual sandwich. Another member in our group ordered the lasagna and the waiter exclaimed that it after 15 minutes he placed the order wrong and it would be late. A beet salad was offered in exchange for this mistake. After 35/40 mins the food came out and was not very appealing. I began to cut into my veal and to my surprise it looked and tasted like chicken. I showed the waiter and he told me he didn't know what to say. The manager came over and told me it was veal. I showed him it clearly wasn't. He said they checked and it was veal that was ordered. I exclaimed that I understood that but I have chicken on my plate. After more arguing he went to the kitchen to investigate. Apparently someone got my veal and never realized it wasn't chicken. I was semi-satisfied with the chicken as I didn't want to wait for fresh veal and I never send anything back to the kitchen. The pasta was old and sticky and the sauce was horrible. This is not an Italian cuisine restaurant even though the name might suggest Roman food. The lasagne ended up coming out on time although it was obviously is was microwaved. Everyone's food was sub-par and the prices are double what they should be. I ended up not having to pay for me chicken/veal Parmesan which is the only positive I can take away from the horrible excuse for fine cuisine.",

    "text": "Food is pretty good, or at least the last time we actually ate there it was. Service has varied from o.k. to poor in the 3 or 4 times we actually ate there.  We had 7:15 reservations Friday night and at 8:00 we still weren't seated.  I won't return for the following reasons:  1. The front of the house is inept, to say the least.  Our first visit was right after they opened, and I excused the incompetence as part of the learning curve.  They haven't improved with time.  2. The noise level in the bar area makes it pointless to try to carry on a conversation. Outside is best, and the dining room in the rear has been acceptable in the past.  Bottom line - meals aren't cheap here and for your money, you can do better at a lot of other places.",

    "text": "Man, I don't know who has anything super negative to say about this place. Some people must be hard to please! I thought it was a great restaurant, and my service was very good. The waitress was very friendly and chatty, and while it was paced out nicely (read, not rushed), I never felt impatient or 'where's my food??' hungry. Whatever service issues from it being new must have been ironed out in the first month.  The food was really good too. It was a little modern and experimental (wood-oven fired flatbreads with duck, made from scratch gumbo with huge hunks of crab and shrimp, pasta with fig and shallots, creme brulee, these are just a few of the things we tried) but it wasn't pretentious. Also the portion sizes were huge! You also get bread that comes out with a dipping plate including olive oil, tapenade, and sun-dried tomato pesto. (See, fancy!)   I'd feel comfortable telling someone that this is a good place to take friends, a date, or even your parents. The atmosphere is just 'nice,' and fits well for a lot of things.  As far as value, we payed $55 (including tip) for a 3 course meal and we still had enough food left over for lunch the next day. I'd call that a great value!  So, overall:  Pros: -good value -fancy, yet not pretentious -classy atmosphere -drink selection -service -delicious food  Cons (I only have two): -music (the background music was a weird mix. They'd do better to just stick on a jazz CD) -the 'beet salad' is actually a salad with beets. But I told the waitress and she took the constructive criticism very graciously and agreed that it needs to be noted better on the menu.  I can't wait to go back! Everything on the menu looked so good. My fiance and I can't wait to try more!",

    "text": "After going to Roman Bistro, I was waiting for Gordon Ramsay to come out and say they were filming an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.  Never before have I seen such a poorly run restaurant.  When we arrived, the dining room area wasn't full, yet it took them over 15 minutes to seat us and there was no explanation.  That should have been a sign to run for the door but we soldiered on.  After they did seat us, the unbelievably unfriendly waitress decided she'd actually come over and ask us if we wanted something to drink.  It was as if we had inconvenienced her with our presence.    The Caesar salad tasted like it had no dressing and anchovies while the cheese was so mild you could barely taste it.  The gazpacho was nice and refreshing on a hot day.  The night we were there, it was thundering outside and I was wishing for a power outage so our entrees wouldn't actually come.  Sadly though, my prayers were not answered so the nightmare meal continued.  The lobster ravioli tasted of cream cheese and were swimming in a mess of olive oil and diced tomatoes.  The crab cakes were not made of lump meat but of a little bit of backfin meat and a whole lot of overly salted filler.  The bison burger was heavily charred and came out at the wrong temperature.  To make matters worse, the \"fried onion\" pieces they put on top were soggy and reminded me of a pile of mucus.  But I dare not complain and ask the waitress who had a stick up her rear to take it back because I didn't want to deal with her attitude.  And who knows, the second time, the burger might actually have mucus on it.  The best thing we had was the beet salad, because it never arrived (although they tried to bill us for it).  I think our biggest mistake was not ordering lots of alcohol so we'd be drunk and wouldn't realize what on earth we were eating and how bad the service actually was.  It looked like everyone else was happy and having a jolly good, drunken time.  Especially the table of 4 next to us that magically ballooned to a party of 6 when they sat down on the bench and effectively joined our table too.  All in all, I certainly will never step foot in here again, even though I'd like to sample some of the beers they have on tap in their impressive selection.",

We were waiting on one more individual who arrived at 6:20, our waitress didn't take his drink order until 6:40 and didn't take our dinner orders until 7:30! Our food didn't come out till around 8:20 - we ate then asked for our cake that we had brought for a birthday, they thought they had lost it and took 15 minutes to find it. All of this while carrying some statue around the restaurant, not saying excuse me to any of the people at our table and almost knocking their heads off with it! The icing on the cake (no pun intended) was when they did not split our bill as we had asked at the start of the meal, then couldn't do so correctly and blamed the point of sale system. After the mangaer came over to help and we told her how disappointed we were with our service, she simply made excuses and did not appologize once for the lack fo service. It was ridiculous. To top it off, my pasta which was supposed to be in a tomato cream sause was basically swimming in a pool of butter. Over priced, awful service and will NEVER go back!",

If you want to eat outdoors you'll be contending with a boulevard, parking lot, and smokers.  Inside is nicer.  The salads were excellent, and the two dishes we had (veal parmigiana and linguine with clams) were in the good to very good category. The pasta did have a different consistency that may be due to their homemade recipe perhaps...it was good, but not great.  The veal and clams were also good, but not great.

My friend and I love to try new places (for one of us) restaurants.  She was looking for a place on the east area of town for Restaurant week - when i suggested Roman Bistro.  While I had been there a few times - she had not.    We both ordered from the restaurant week menu while her 3 children ordered off the regular menu.  While 2 of the kids were disappointed with the size of the kids portion flatbread - they were all very pleased with their food.    My friend and i LOVED our food.  The portions were large (i took a bit home from each course!) and scrumptious  (they were also scrumptious the next day!)  While I have had not so hot experiences at Roman Bistro (I just couldn't bring myself to give them 5 stars) - I still enjoy it and keep going back.  It is good food :)",

    "text": "I wanted to like it here. I really did. Not only do I live close by, but I'm an Italian with an appetite.   After years of driving by, we decided to go here to celebrate a special occasion--just my partner and my mom. Why did it take so long to stop in? It feels upscale suburban from the outside. Sort of like the Olive Garden but with more alcohol. Haha. I don't know what that means exactly but that's the impression I got from the folks coming and going. I wasn't sure it was my ambiance. Still, I decided it was time so we popped in one late afternoon/early Sunday evening. Despite the time and the lack of a crowd, we still waited a lot for just about everything.    The menu excited us. There seemed to be a decent amount of options. I have to admit, though, I am always annoyed when $20+ pasta dishes do not come with salad. First real strike. Oddly though, they came with a side of vegetables, which we never received. By this point, we didn't want to wait longer.   The waiter was friendly, but clearly distracted. I'm pretty forgiving of kind waitstaff, even if they are forgetful or clumsy. He never did bring our refills or check on us after bringing the food. We had to wave someone down every time... and there weren't many people around. The last straw was not bringing us our boxes (and this was the owner/manager, at this point). We had to find someone up front for those. Never any apologies for any of it.   I almost forgot to mention the bug/gnat issue. What can I say? It was annoying, at best. They were flying about and landing on our table. My mom spent half of the time swatting in front of her face. It made me feel bad for bringing her, to be honest.   All that to say, the food was pretty good. The breaded zucchini (appetizer) was the tastiest, reminiscent of The Italian Oven--if you remember that spot. For the price, coupled with the service, I left unsatisfied with the experience. The food might've tasted better if the experience was better, you know? I always say customer service colors everything. This was very True in this case.",

Our drinks were promptly served, however the bread that was mentioned had to be asked for when the waiter forgot. Not too big of a deal, although we noticed them cleaning a display towards the main entrance rather than checking on us..   Wait for food was at least 35-40 minutes.   Food was okay, but I would not recommend the white flat bread, very dry. If you add olive oil from the table it adds flavor.   My friend did not enjoy her salad, but I thought it was delightful.   Again, I would try again, but would not recommend between their switch from dinner to lunch (1:30-3:30).",

    "text": "It's probably about time I've written something about Roman Bistro since I've lived in the area for about five years and have been here numerous times. They're definitely on my short list for favorite Italian places in Pittsburgh.  I've never had an issue with the service. The place is a mix of casual and mildly upscale, so you could bring your family here or a date and not really feel out of place either way. They have a phenomenal selection of wine and beer.  There are happy hour specials and a build your own pasta night. Cigars are available for purchase but I'm genuinely unclear if you can actually smoke them anywhere on the premises. Maybe outside on the patio?  The food is very good and some of the pastas have different prices for lunch and dinner portions. The Tortellacci is one of my go-to dishes. Last time I had the Buccatini Amatriciana which was fantastic. I ordered the Roman Bistro club once for lunch and it took me two meals to finish it. The only thing I'm not real crazy about is the weekend brunch, which fills up very quickly and is just a simple buffet style. I'll eat it, but there are other places I'd rather go.  I'm probably overthinking this, but this is one of those times when I'm torn between four or five stars. As I said the brunch doesn't really win me over. Pricing sometimes feels a touch too expensive for me for a place that isn't as distinctively formal as some other Italian restaurants. Overall though I like the food enough and there's enough aspects worth giving them the benefit of the doubt.",

It was during their transition from brunch to dinner and there were only 2 other tables in the whole restaurant. Walking in we thought it was super cute and couldn't wait to try their food for restaurant week. We were seated right away and got our drinks fairly quick. After we ordered our food, our waiter said he would bring out the bread and oil. It never came. 45 minutes later of waiting for our food, the appetizers finally came out. I got the maple bacon Brussel salad. I was not impressed. It was literally drenched in maple syrup. I might as well have been eating soup. 30 minutes later our second dish came out and they finally brought our bread. My main course was the blackened Chilean sea bass. It had absolutely no flavor. I couldn't even finish it because I was so confused as to how something that looks so good tastes like nothing at all. We ended up being at the restaurant for almost 2 hours so I had to get my third course to go. It's safe to say I will not be returning.",

Their private parking lot can get full but overflow parking is available near by. There is covered patio seating for nice weather. There is table seating in the bar area with large screen televisions plus loads of seating in the restaurant seating area. The staff I've encountered has always been friendly and attentive. The butternut squash ravioli is my favorite entree. The portion sizes are generous and I'm never left feeling hungry. Each night of the week is a different feature: Monday's is Wings, Tuesday is Wine, Wednesday is Pasta, Thursday is Ladies, Friday is Happy Hour, Saturday is Prime Rib.

The seating gets busy some nights so you can get really good service when its slower but even when it's busy it is worth the wait!    We had the Ciaoppino and the Butternut Squash Ravioli.   Both cooked perfectly, and plenty of vegetables and toppings.   You have to ask for cheese on top.   The sauces there are a little thinner (just to warn those of you who like thick sauce) but they are still very tasty and not bland - worth mopping up with some bread.   The salads are a good portion and definitely more tasty than salads elsewhere!   If you go ask for Hanna!",

However, the veal saltimbocca was dreadful. Veal was leathery and awfully over cooked. Breading for the veal was poorly executed and turned out to be a slimy flap of soggy breading. For the sauce they were extremely heavy handed on the Marsala for the sauce. Would go back for the lobster ravioli alone but due to inconsistency I wouldn't venture into the menu any further",

I can't comment on any of the dishes our friends got, but i will comment on ours.   I actually really liked the Bada-Bing Shrimp.  The red sauce was wonderfully spicy and the shrimp were perfectly, lightly battered.  My only complaint was there wasn't enough red sauce (it was just one modest droplet in each corner).  We split the Prosciutto and Funghi pizza and honestly it was whelming at best and is one of the reasons for my rating above.  It was an artery-clogging cheese fest with barely any hint of prosciutto.  The mushrooms seemed to be barely there, and if they were they were either buried under the cheese or cooked to negate any flavor.   The service was good, a smidge slow at times.  And, while the complementary bread was nice, they need to give more instead of making the wait-staff go and get more for parties who enjoy the bread.  Roman Bistro was solid.  Will we be back? Eh, maybe, but honestly if you want mostly budget-friendly Americanized Italian food, you have better options.",

When I finally got his attention he informed me that they were out of the Spanish rose, so he substituted Barefoot rose. (At the same price btw!!!) Ummmm, no. You can't just substitute PLONK for what I ordered and not even consult me. I'm just done.",

    "text": "First things first, we come from Cleveland where we eat in Little Italy on Murray Hill regularly- most of those restaurants have been open and in the same family for 30-50+ years. It has become apparent to me that the Italians do not rush you through any meal. To me, this is just an Italian thing- they love their food, and love feeding others their food even more so. So the pace of the service is not as rushed as other restaurants. It is relaxed and laid back, almost like you're eating at home. I guess my point is, we never expect a True Italian meal to be any kind of 'quick'. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think I am.  This is how it was tonight, the service was relaxed but not at all slow and notedly efficient. Everyone was extremely friendly from the hostess that greeted us at the door, to our awesome server Judy. I had 4 kids aged 7-18 and she was great with all of them!  The food was delicious, portions huge (their Nona would be proud) and it was very family friendly.  Highly recommend, and we'll be back if we are ever in the area again- thanks for all the love Judy!",

    "text": "Today will be my final visit to roman bistro. Since it opened, my husband and I frequented there for dinner several times per month, in addition to some later night bar stops. We have noticed a decline in both service and food quality over the past 6-8 months. The service is consistently slow regardless of the order, time of day, crowd level. We had my fathers surprise 70th party there in February. We reserved the  party room for the event. Upon arrival that day, we learned we had been moved to the back dining area because a baby shower had displaced us. Isn't this why I made a deposit? To reserve the room? Instead we were awkwardly put in the dining room, making the seating difficult and service less than stellar. I was not pleased with the party, the hostess was less than pleasant, especially considering the hefty bill that came with the party.   Nonetheless, we have been back a few more times since then and have noticed the decline in service and quality, but remained hopeful it could return to its promising beginning. Unfortunately, I came to realize today that day will not come, especially now that the owner's focus will be on the new mount Washington location.  My mom and I arrived for Lunch at noon to a fairly empty room. It took 15 minutes to be greeted by a server to take our drink order. Seeing this lack of attention, we placed our food order as well. It took 35 minutes to receive our food-a sandwich and salmon salad. During our wait, a large party arrived in the bar area, and there were only two servers to take care of the entire area! The host was running orders and making drinks. How do you staff this way for a lunch rush? My moms sandwich was fine when it finally arrived. My salad was another story. The salmon was just ok. The lettuce was completely brown and wilted. I ate the salmon and waited for the server to return  to check on us and our food and planned to show him the brown/wilted lettuce that filled the $14 bowl. He never came back. Not once.No one ever came back to check on us, to fill our drinks, nothing. After another 15-20 minutes I had to seek out the one other server to ask for our check and a box for my mom. She was visibly annoyed with my request. The host finally brought both over without asking a word about our meals/experience. I am beyond frustrated and disappointed with our experience today at a dining establishment that classifies themselves as a superior place for meals. I would have been better off at panera for my salad.",

Our wait staff inside the party was so friendly, helpful, patient and attentive; we couldn't ask for better service. We had 3 choices on our party menu and guests raved at how delicious everything tasted; the food was served quickly after ordering and in a great flow with the shower activities. We were not rushed out in any way leaving ample time to visit, chat, take pictures, etc at the end of the party.

Quite simply, I think the problem is one of consistency wherein the menu items (and the menu itself) are too variable and too unreliable, tasting and looking from visit to visit. Prior ordered favorites become a memory. This may be traced to different food preparers or \"off days\" in the kitchen. My most recent (and likely last) visit brought forth flatbread which was basically a shingle of matzo cracker with some forlorn chopped veggies aboard with a dollop of dipping sauce. The beet salad, lifeless lettuce partnered with a few canned beets, was sad indeed. I would bet that the chefs/cooks have been in transition and turn over. A place of promise, unfulfilled.",

He wasn't friendly at all and seemed very unpleasant.  To get to the point.  Food was pretty good. But no one came to check on us or see if we needed anything.

    "text": "I recently read a report indicating that independent restaurants have been out performing chains for the first time. i was a bit shocked, but then i thought about Roman Bistro! And it started to make sense.           This place is really doing things right. Across the board, you name it, food, ambiance, service, menu selections/choices and changes.  They never stand still. In all areas they continuously raise their own bar. The owners have built a pretty darn impressive crew of employees who are loyal and seem proud to be part of something so cool.            The place is cleaner than the board of health, a huge plus, and Roman Bistro is gorgeous to begin with (double win) They nail events, parties and big holidays. Just a very very well run, restaurant. Its gotten to the point now where Roman Bistro has become part of Greater Pittsburgh, and we are lucky to have her.            Most of these reviews are about the food. Well, back to the first thought. They are outperforming and the food is obviously the driving catalyst of that. Big menu that will touch every want small, large, simple or unusual, the food is always really top notch and you can tell its a scratch approach, you get the feeling that there is a lot of 'homemade' going on back in the kitchen. You can't fake authentic. I could go on and on about the food there and what i have eaten, i will let everyone else do that.             Bottom line.....GREAT PLACE! really just an impressive job by an independent who is nailing it, and deserves it. Well done! 2 thumbs up!",

All were decent.  Bada bing shrimp was just OK.  I wouldn't order it again though.  The bar is this place's asset.  Bartenders are great!

The Sunday brunch buffet is a good value with made to order omelets, waffles, and plenty of brunch and dessert options! Highly recommend the pork osso bucco. One problem I have with the Roman Bistro is the food can be very inconsistent. I pick up takeout often and the last 3x we've ordered the same sandwiches, they have came on 3 different buns. One week a hamburger bun, next week hoagie roll, the week after that ciabatta rolls. My husband was so irritated about a fish sandwich on a ciabatta bun I won't be picking it up again anytime soon. I don't know if it's a matter of them running out of the right stuff, but when you have to substitute ingredients this information should really be communicated. The vegetables of the day seem to be an afterthought as well.",

    "text": "One of the meals I love when eating Italian is chosen from the appetizers (mussels) and salads. My choice for this restaurant was mussels in a marinara sauce and the beet and arugula salad.  I love mussels and marinara but did not care for this dish. When choosing mussels, larger are not always better, and these were the largest mussels I have ever seen. I have not been served mussels this large when eating on the coast! They were a bit chewy and when I hit one that was sandy and chewy I stopped. There was very little marinara sauce in the broth that was in the bowl so it came off as tomatoey water rather than a sauce.  The salad, on the other hand was excellent. Their basil lemon vinaigrette is wonderful. I was sopping it up with my bread.  My husband had the lasagna, his go-to when trying a new Italian restaurant, and he was not impressed. He said the meat to sauce ratio was too heavy on the meat side which left the dish a little dry but he did like the flavor of the sauce which can make or break an Italian meal.   We took leftovers home (Hubby and son traded) and must say our son did the best when ordering. His order was the stuffed manicotti which was very good.  These were the only dishes I tasted at our table of 4 and if we do go back I will  definitely be ordering the beet salad again.",

I don't know what they spent on the steak for the salad but i do not understand how they came up with the price of $17. I didn't get a 17 dollar salad tonight for sure.",

Even after being understanding of the delay, the server walked away clearly seeing that we had empty glasses with no offer to provide a refill- we had to flag her down and ask. When the food did finally arrive, one entree was cold and neither were very good. The manager did handle the situation very well, she removed both entrees from our check. I commend the manager for how the circumstance was handled. The servers need lots of training... I had 1.5 hours to observe their lack of attentiveness to tables and poor prioritization in service staff. By way of where we were seated, I could also see the expo in the kitchen who appeared clearly stressed and arguing with servers. It was clearly an \"off night\" but it could have been more easily pleasant with outstanding service to compliment some of the other issues. Again, the manager was extremely professional.",

    "text": "SUCCULENT Moist and tasty :  TOOTHSOME  A friend of mine was recently in town due to the passing of his father.  As with a lot of situations in life, sharing a good meal with friends and loved ones can help carry us away from our own personal grief filled moments.  Our visit to Roman Bistro was one of those moments where we could set aside the reason for the return home and build new memories to cherish in the future.  There are several dining spaces at the Roman Bistro and a main entry with a white baby grand piano.  Comfortable, cozy and welcoming all the way around.  We were quickly seated and our server could not have been more pleasant.  Additionally, throughout our meal the restaurant manager and server checked to make sure that we were content and not in need of anything.  During the fall and winter months, I enjoy warm and comforting food.  Thick stews, hearty soups and roasted meats.  Stick to your rib fare, for sure, but also food that feels like a warm hug.  I ordered the pork osso bucco served with garlic polenta and sauteed broccoli with roasted tomatoes.  My friend ordered the chicken artichoke piccata with linguini and my daughter Muff ordered the white bruschetta pizza.  Each meal was different yet the same with its comforting aspects.  The osso bucco, usually made from veal shanks but in this case with a pork shank, was tender and succulent.  I don't know how they achieved the somewhat crispy roasted outside and moist inside... Truly, all I had to do was nudge the meat with my fork and it came away from the bone.  The demi-glace sauce and side dishes were also impeccable.  I usually don't order any type of piccata dishes in restaurants simply because the chefs seem to go overboard with the tart aspects of this style of dish.  This dish was well executed with just the right amount of acidulousness from the lemon and capers and balanced with the right amount of butter.  My daughter's white bruschetta pizza was brightened with a porcini glaze that cut through the richness of the pizza.  We each sampled food from one another's plates and thoroughly enjoyed the nourishment for our bodies and souls during the time that we spent with one another.  Roman Bistro invites these types of moments through their food, impeccable service and ambiance.  If you're in the area  or just need a food hug, fare una visita al Roman Bistro.",

I recognized the containers because they had a sticker on them. The sticker had been ripped off, but not completely for my take out order. The leftover containers had been placed next to my gifts and were clearly intended for me to take back home NOT be used by the restaurant for their future take out orders.   In addition to my stolen containers, which by the way can not be okay with the health board, the cookies and chocolate on top of my cake weren't given to me. They were either tossed out or kept by the staff. My cake was originally cut by someone from the restaurant but after that the guests had to cut their own cake.  The restaurant charges $1 per person to cut the cake but didn't cut the cake. My mother-in-law had cake in one of the to go containers next to her on the table. When it disappeared she asked a waitress if they had seen it. The waitress told her she would check but when walking past my Aunt stated \"I didn't steal her cake.\"    There were also several pieces of cake left after the shower that mysteriously disappeared after the guests left.   I am disappointed in this place. We've been here for dinner and have had various larger dinner parties here. I will no longer visit this establishment and will not recommend it to anyone else",

Out later Corey was absolutely outstanding in fact I have dubbed him the king of all waiters and I hope that the next time I'm in I will see him on the Roman bistro  server walk of fame. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and the bar but he also gave excellent recommendations off of the menu. And was quite attentive to US during our evening. I have their version of shrimp scampi only with a light creamy sauce with pine nuts.  My husband had another delusions pasta dish with sausage clams calamari muscles.  The portions were grande vente even, and really will delight again on the leftovers tomorrow.  Thanks Roman Bistro... Thank you Corey... Server Extrodinair! See you all soon.",

Kind of discouraging. I also had to wait several minutes for a drink refill which is a pet peeve of mine. If I am at a restaurant, paying for a dinner experience, don't make me wait for more water. The food was not prepared as ordered- salmon was cooked less than I asked for. Food was average and overpriced. Wasn't impressed and will pass the next time someone asked if I'd like to go to dinner there.",

    "text": "I visited Roman Bistro with a couple of good friends this past Sat. evening at around 6:30.  I normally don't get out this way too often, but my friends' house is nearby and they're frequent customers, so they invited me to dinner with them here.  Given that they enjoy Roman Bistro, I was keen to check out one of their favorite haunts, so I took them up on their offer.  Our visit got off to a bit of a rocky start when no waitstaff came to greet us for 10 min. after being seated, so one of my friends went to inform the hostess.  At that point, a waitress came to greet us within a couple of minutes, accompanied by a manager who offered us comped appetizers.  We took the manager up on this offer and got two orders of the bada bing shrimp ($13 each), which turned out to be delicious, with just the right amount of spice and a nice crunch.  We also ordered drinks, with one of my friends ordering a beer, and my other friend and I ordering their specialty martinis (chocolate and strawberry blond, respectively; $8, -$1 with Yelp check-in discount).  When my martini was served, I took a sip and then noticed something that turned out to be a fruit fly in my drink, so the waitress apologetically got me another one.  Be forewarned that this drink must be a major fruit fly attractor, since my second drink was served without any fruit flies, but one got into it as I sipped on it throughout the meal (this time, I fished it out without complaint).  For our entrees, I ordered the chicken artichoke piccata ($21), one friend ordered the flatiron steak ($23), and the other ordered the pumpkin ravioli special ($24).  Additionally, each of us ordered a side of soup or salad with our meal ($4 each).  I ordered the New England Clam Chowder, which was thick and had a decent amount of clam, but was rather salty.  My chicken piccata, which consisted of grilled chicken breasts over linguine with capers and artichokes in a lemon butter sauce, was quite delicious, and was a big enough portion for two meals (I ate half there and the other half for dinner the next night).  Because I don't eat beef, I didn't try the steak, but my friend who ordered it seemed quite satisfied with it.  The star of the show, though, was the pumpkin ravioli that my other friend ordered, which she generously let me sample.  The filling consisted of pumpkin and mascarpone cheese, and was rich yet seemed light and airy, and was dressed with an allspice cream sauce.  If you see this seasonal item on the menu and you enjoy pumpkin, be sure to order it--you won't be disappointed!  Before heading back to my friends' house, all of us ordered dessert to go.  One friend and I ordered the death by chocolate ($7), a huge slice of chocolate cake with chocolate icing and shavings drizzled with chocolate sauce.  Needless to say, if you're a chocoholic, this is the dessert for you!  My other friend ordered a slice of the NY cheesecake topped with raspberry sauce ($7), which I didn't try but looked delicious.  Despite the rocky start, my friends and I were quite satisfied with the service from our waitress, Lori Anne, throughout the meal.  While I ordered more than I usually do when dining out, and I thought the price point was a tad steep, I can't complain too much, given the comped apps and drink and the slight drink discount.  Based on the crowd and clientele and the casual atmosphere, it's clear that that Roman Bistro is a favorite haunt of the locals, and I can see why.",

Customers should not have to try to engage the help - it should be the help making customers feel welcome. Asked for the beer glass to be full on one occasion and was told \"that's how we pour\". That's okay, we get it. Other establishments want our business.  Sad that yours doesn't.",

We had the steak medallions, grilled chicken, and cheese ravioli with pasta, salad, and bread. Everything we delicious! We all really loved the cheese ravioli. Everyone there was so helpful. Tammy and Pam were great! We were able to utilize one of the TV displays for a presentation, which was awesome. I would definitely recommend booking here for a lunch meeting or a small lunch & learn event!",

    "text": "Raw fish served twice!                                                    I was looking for a new place for hubby and myself to dine and found great reviews for this restaurant.  Excited to visit and when arrived, everyone was so friendly.  I ordered the fish special, Barramundi and my husband ordered the stuffed shrimp.  When served dinners, i took a bite and the fish was delicious.  The manager came over and asked how everything was, to which we replied \"great\".  When I tried to take a bite of fish from the center of fillet, i couldn't get my fork through the fish.  The middle of my fish was raw.  The waitstaff took it back and apologized.  After waiting maybe 10 minutes, the manager gave me a new plate and asked me to make sure it was cooked.  It wasn't, again raw in the middle. Manager asked if I wanted to order something else, I replied, No,  just cook the fish.  When presented my entree the third time, whoever cooked the fish had chopped it up in small pieces and it was COOKED.  Unfortunately, my husband was done eating by this time.  So much for a nice dinner together.  The waitstaff came over after I was almost done eating and asked if we wanted dessert.  No Thanks : (    We were presented with the check, no discount, no offering for dessert, drink,????   When we were walking out, the manager ran over and asked that we wait a minute, she then went into kitchen and gave me a card for a free dessert the next time we visited.  It wasn't a good experience at all, we didn't get to eat dinner together and no offering to make up for the raw fish was offered.  We won't go back, too many places to eat.  In the past, if we had a bad meal or experience, we were usually given something to make up for the mistake.  I'm wondering if this was the reason that on a Saturday night, there were minimal people dining.",

I was actually so angry from waiting for service from a surly bartender who insisted on correcting our nomenclature on our drink order that I almost walked out.  My Mother had wanted to bring me here so I took a deep breath and TRIED to order.  Meatball sandwich in Pittsburgh should be pretty safe, right???  Me,  \"Can I have a small salad instead of fries?\"  Surly bartender, \"No.\"  REALLY???   Food arrives quickly ergo one star. Food was absolutely horrible!  My mother had the blackened prime rib sandwich.  I had the meatball hoagie without salad.  Both were bland and tasteless. The manager asked us how it was and I told her.  She credited us for the meals which was appreciated but doesn't save the poor service and bad food.",

There were two issues with getting our order right, and there wasn't anything special about the orders... Sides and salad dressings were messed up.  Simply the kitchen not reading tickets on a leisurely afternoon.  One meal was fine, the other dry and with the tell tale signs of being under the lights in the window for too long.  The server was attentive when flagged down but slow and scattered on her own.  All of the mistakes combined mean not only will we not return, but we will be sure to discourage friends looking for a bite in Forest Hills from visiting.",
