    "text": "I feel a bit awkward being the first outlier ruining the average 5 star rating but take it for its worth after my explanation.  And really if I could I would give this place a solid 3.5 stars.    Agreed with the other reviewers, service was great and the place was jumpin on a Saturday night.  My friend and I had reservations for 8:15 pm but we arrived an hour earlier and grabbed a drink by the bar.  We both had the malbec to begin with which was decent.  A server was coming by the bar to pass around a sampler of their signature \"bang bang shrimp\" appetizer.  We each took one piece and the flavor of the sauce was good - creamy with a bit of a kick.  The shrimp was meaty but I noticed a slight aftertaste which to me indicated that that it's not the freshest...but again, it tasted good.    We got seated fairly promptly around 8:00 and I ordered the Caesar salad the tilapia stuffed with crab meat and scallops.  Before the salad, we received bread with olive oil and pesto which in my opinion was the highlight of the meal.  It was good - real gooood.  That pesto sauce on its own was good enough for me to start licking the plates clean!    Ok now on to the salad.  The Caesar salad was a bit heavy on the dressing.  I never thought I'd hear myself say that because I LOVE dressing.  But it was overkill.  It was like I was getting Caesar dressing with a side of romaine lettuce and a spattering of croutons.    On to the tilapia stuffed with crab meat and scallops.  As a side I got the chickpeas and steamed veggies.  Both of the sides were very good.  The fish was good, but it didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked it to.  The stuffing was a bit too creamy for me - it was like mayo mixed with crab meat and scallops.  And also the baby scallops were a bit rubbery as I was eating them.  I probably ate 1/3 of my entree and packed the rest to go.    While Bonefish is a decent option in the suburban sprawl of chain restaurants that's just what it is...a good chain restaurant.  They mentioned that they fly in their fish fresh daily, but I've definitely had better tasting fish in the Burgh so I'm a bit skeptical about that statement.  I'm a huge seafood fan so my standards are high when it comes to seafood restaurants.  Traveling often to a coastal town when growing up I've had some of the freshest fish available so I know fresh fish.",

My shrimp and scallops were cooked to perfection. Not too chewy not too dry. The sides were tasty. They did not skimp on the taste of the sides. My husbands twin lobster tails were perfectly broiled. He loved the garlic whipped potatoes.    We followed our dinner with the macadamia nut brownie...even that was perfect. We are so happy to have visited because we now have a new date night spot.",

    "text": "My husband and I are having a hard time figuring out why this restaurant is so busy (at least on Friday and Saturday night).  It must be because of the paucity of decent restaurants in the South Hills.  On our last, and what will probably be our last, visit, we ordered two apps, two entrees and a beer.  The Bang Bang Shrimp and the beer were, according to my husband excellent.  That's where the good ended.  My Wagyu Beef & Ginger Potstickers were a gummy mess.  The filling was good, the toppings were good, but the wrappers - yuck!  They tasted like they had been in the steamer all day.  When I pointed this out the manager, he said they were pan fried.  Yeah, right.  Maybe pan fried and then reheated in the microwave.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the Spicy Tuna Bowl.  The tuna was ice cold, right out of the fridge cold.  There is an asterisk after the name of this dish on the menu which says:  *These items are cooked to order.  Now wouldn't you think this would mean the food would be hot?  The manager argued with me about that one, too.  In my opinion, if it's not going to be hot, it should be warm or room temp, not ice cold.  The rice was hot, the avocado looked good but the star of the dish was awful.  My husband's Ahi Tuna Steak with lemon butter sauce was a disaster.  He ordered it cooked medium; it looked raw inside but was still cold at the center.  He said he'd never tasted anything worse than the sauce.  His broccoli was mush.  We each had one bite of our food and then waited for the server to reappear, which took a while.  The manager comped us on everything but the shrimp app and the beer, but really at that point why bother to charge us for anything?  We had a coupon for the shrimp, and he still charged us for the beer!  A comment on the service:  our server was nice and friendly and competent, but they need to up their game when training.  We had the dishes from two apps and bread and plates sitting on our table.  The runner who brought the entrees set our dinners down on the corner of the table and left without taking anything with her.  The server and manager did offer other food, but at that point I just wanted out.  It will be a long, long time before we even contemplate going there again.",

The revolving door at the entrance is a neat feature for a restaurant, I'm easily amused by things like that.   The inside of the restaurant feels modern, when compared to places like Joe's Crab Shack, or Red Lobster, yet it still felt okay being casual. Our server was Melanie, she was pleasant, and after getting our beverages, let us know ordering Bang Bang Shrimp as a starter was a good move.   The lunch special my daughter ordered was Lily's Salmon with goat cheese, I went with the Maryland lump crab cakes with red remoulade.   The Bang Bang Shrimp was good, the Thai style creamy sauce was tasty, and made the dish. My daughter said her salmon was great, the goat cheese was new for her, and she quickly learned to not eat the goat cheese by itself, but to eat it with her mashed potatoes, and salmon. My crab cakes were smaller than I expected, I got two that were a little larger than meatballs. The lump crab was easy to see, and there was not a heavy bread crumb, or filler ratio. My sauteed spinach tasted very fresh, and just needed a bit of salt.   We had an early lunch in a quiet, not crowded restaurant. Overall it was a nice experience.",

For starters, they didn't honor our reservation and made us wait 30 mins to be seated while others who arrived after us were seated before. After that it was just slow service - mainly the kitchen/bar at fault, often with our table being served after other tables that were seated after us.   The final insult was the table next to us receiving a complimentary desert to apologize for the slow service, yet we weren't comped anything.  Full timeline is as follows:  6:15 - reservation 6:45 - seated 7:00 - drinks served  7:10 - bread came to the table 7:25 - soup arrives 7:50 - food arrives after the table next to us was served first 8:15 - table next to us receives a complimentary dessert for slow service, despite being seated at 7:00 8:25 - bill comes 8:35 - out the door",

    "text": "For a long time I would drive by Bonefish Grill during my monthly trips to Target and think to myself, \"One day I'm actually going to eat dinner there!\" And finally recently I had the chance to do just that.  I went here for a Friday night birthday dinner with a group of friends. Immediately I saw that Bonefish Grill is the kind of place where you're better off getting a reservation - the entire place was full except for the table set aside for my group. Bonefish is also not the place to go if you want to enjoy a quiet dinner conversation; the noise level admittedly got better as the night went on (my group left close to 10:15 PM), but it was quite loud when I arrived.  Business and high volume of noise aside, I actually really enjoyed dining here - the food and service were both impressive. Our waiter checked on our group frequently to refill our drinks and make sure we were happy with our food. In fact when our appetizer was brought out he even said that it took so long to get it to us that he was dropping it from our bill. And here we weren't going to complain and had thought things were moving pretty smoothly considering how busy the place was! It was a nice surprise.  For my main course I went for the ahi tuna, which had a very interesting mix of sesame and soy sauces with light touches of wasabi and ginger - which combined gave the tuna a tasty but (thankfully) moderate kick. By the way, if you're not talking about your food during dinner, you'll probably be talking about your drinks; my friends' drink was brought out in an actual cup made out of ice! Half of our table didn't even believe it was ice until we watched it melt throughout the night. Talk about different! And the desserts? Quite large and quite delicious - our group of four went ahead and shared a giant piece of strawberry shortcake to wrap up all of our meals.  All in all Bonefish left a good impression and a great taste in my mouth when I rolled my way on out of here. Now I want to come back to try their steak and crabcake dinner and see what other interesting drinks come in that cool ice cup - no pun intended.",

I dont often send food back, but this was a real disappointment since it's a place that specializes in fish and seafood. Sent it back for grilled fillet with lobster sauce. Didn't mind the wait as my Cosmo kept me busy!  Second dish arrived cooked rare as requested. Very fresh, very good. Veg cooked to perfection.  Very pleasant wait staff despite late hour on Saturday evening!",

    "text": "We've only been to Bonefish once, but when there are so many better alternatives, I simply wasn't impressed enough to rush back any time soon. Don't get me wrong, it's not  really a baaaaad restaurant in any way, but don't expect to leave Bonefish saying, \"I can't wait to go back!\"  We got there early, which was beneficial for the lack of a wait, but it quickly filled up as we ate our meal. I would expect a wait if you're not in there by 6 or so.  The service was good, with both the hostess and the waitress being amicable. The waitress was helpful in answering any questions that we had about the menu. The atmosphere is pretty nice, but also pretty standard for a chain seafood place. Think Mitchell's or McCormick's with a hint of P.F. Chang's darker colors and vibe.  Anyway, the food was why my review was 3 stars. We heard a lot of people recommend the bang bang shrimp (as well as seeing just about every other table ordering them), so we gave them a chance. My first thought? Too much mayonnaise-based sauce. I mean, I'm a fairly gluttonous American who enjoys some disgusting mayo from time to time, but c'mon...why even serve anything of any quality under all of that sauce? It's all you taste. The shrimp were good, but I got pretty bored with the sauce after a while. If there's a next time, I'm going to see if I can get a ramekin of sauce on the side instead of having the shrimp pre-smothered.  As for the entree, my wife got the shrimp and scallops with the warm mango salsa. I tried them and they were okay, but fairly ordinary. The veggie sides of asparagus and broccoli were also fairly basic, but kudos to them for having healthy sides.   I opted for the fish tacos, which were basically in the same vein as my wife's meal. Unfortunately, as the bang bang shrimp are lathered in sauce, the tacos come with too much sour cream on them. I really wondered what the point of the sour cream was, actually. Cajun styled fish (but not spicy in any way), lettuce, mango salsa...seems good enough, but no...must. add. sour cream? Again, I like sour cream, but it's a really unnecessary ingredient here.  As you can tell, the themes at Bonefish are basically this: if you order something simple, it's going to be pretty boring and you'll wonder why you didn't just make this at home. If you order something \"adventurous,\" it's basically only adventurous because it's going to slopped over with sauce. In my mind, places like Bonefish that advertise on the premise of having higher-quality fish, should really let the fish do the talking, not the mayo and sour cream.",

    "text": "I have been to The Bonefish twice now and had a wonderful experience both times. If you like seafood, you'll definitely love it here, but they have many non-seafood items as well. So if you aren't into fish/lobster/shrimp, you can still get a fantastic meal.  During both of my trips we have gotten the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer. Soooo incredibly good. I liked it so much I got the bang bang shrimp tacos as a meal my first time. The second time I went I had the lobster grilled cheese. It comes with lobster bisque and greens. Such an awesome twist on the traditional grilled cheese and tomato soup. I'm also told the sangria is excellent but have not gotten to try it yet.  Be warned that if you walk in at normal dinner hours, you'll likely be waiting awhile for a table. I recommend making a reservation. There isn't really a waiting area either...so the front of the restaurant/bar area gets packed.  Service is very friendly and helpful. I do wish the restaurant was lit a little brighter. It makes reading the menu a little hard.  Love the Bonefish! Can't wait until the next time I go back!",

This has the perks of being a chain in that it is very standardized, consistent, accountability, but it seems like a privately owned place b/c the food is excellent, fresh, top notch and the service is remarkable.  Atmosphere: Casual elegance, modern fresh feel, classy bar area with seating, good lighting  Service: Excellent, the waitress was able to make honest recommendations about the menu. Our drinks were never empty, perfect timing with each course, very personable without being overly personal, very professional and relaxing vibe  Food: EXCELLENT! The complimentary bread and herb oil is a nice start. We had the ahi tuna app and it was to die for. Dinner was fresh salmon done to perfection, cheesy scalloped potatoes were an unexpected find. I want to try the mac and cheese next time. The drink menu has lots of great options, I had the classic Patron Margarita which was nice, not too sweet, not made from a bottle mix. Dessert was home made doughnut dish with fresh whip cream and sauces for dripping. A perfect meal!  Highly recommend this place! The quality of all the nice places down town Pittsburgh, but with a parking lot!",

We got there when it opened so we had no wait. Our waiter was friendly but took a long time to deliver my special requests. We enjoyed the bread and pesto sauce. My girlfriend had a limited edition crab dinner complete with crabmeat. I had their special salmon on their daily special. Portion size is not overwhelming but enough to satisfy. We both found our meals good.  They are a bit on the pricy side but since we stuck to our entrees and regular beverages the bill wasn't overwhelming. After we paid our bill I asked for a refill which I never received. We then decided to leave.  I did not realize this place is a chain and will note that for future reference. I do like the fact that it is casual dining but I would have suggested a better location for it.",

At first our waitress seemed attentive, she took our order for a bottle of wine within the first 5 minutes, but after that everything went downhill.  We had to ask for bread after our salads arrived, then it took another ten minutes to get the bread.  Then our dinners arrived when we had not even finished our salads.  I told the server to send the dinners back because we had just received our salads and bread.  Then finally our waitress came to the table to see how we were doing and we told her what happen, she was totally indifferent to the situation. Of course, they sent out the same dinners that probably were sitting under a warmer, that came to the table as over cooked fish and lacking the luster of a fresh dinner plate.   Then we had the nerve to order dessert,  donuts that come with whipped cream and chocolate sauce which came to the table without an offer of dessert plates and silverware!!! I guess I expect better service for a dinner that costs close to $100.00.",

It's very nicely decorated inside though and our waitress couldn't have been better.    My latest visit we ordered ceviche to share. It had no citrus flavor and the chunks of fish and scallops were very tough and fishy. The shrimp in it was ok, but this wasn't nearly as good as the civiche at Mitchell's.    I had a blackberry red sangria which was pretty good and reasonably priced at $6.00.   I had the Lily's chicken for dinner,  because fish and chips, and crab cakes on past visits weren't great.  The chicken had wayyyy too many greens on top, and the goat cheese was very sour. And I love goat cheese. Their mashed potatoes are very good.   Three of us shared the macadamia brownie...it was a very small portion for the price and was more like a crumbly cake than a brownie. Another \"meh\" moment.   Someone got the sirloin and crabcake dinner and really liked it, and another in our party got the salmon with mango salsa and said \"it's just ok\" when asked.    The 5 year old tore up the popcorn shrimp and fries.    Two of us put our food on the same check.  We had $55 in gift cards between us and still had to pay $20 each. Almost $100 for a shared appetizer, 2 dinners, a sangria, and a shared dessert. All of which, except the sangria and mashed potatoes, were just mediocre?  No.      There are too many great places around with reliably good food to go back here.  While i don't hate it here, i don't love it either. For the price, I'll stay with Mitchell's or Bahama breeze!",

Bonefish Grill was a delightful experience - from the friendly staff to the delicious food, the dining experience didn't skip a beat.  After some thought on what to eat, we asked the waitress for some suggestions. Appetizer - Bang Bang Shrimp: Didn't sound so appetizing, but had to call the waitress over to tell her how amazing this dish was. Definitely try it! Dinner - Salmon with Imperial Topping: The great thing is is that you can mix and match the toppings on all of the seafood. Drinks - Winter White Cosmo: Probably my favorite new drink. Made to perfection and I might just have to remake it for my holiday parties!  Definitely a great spot to check out. Pretty busy during dinner time - make sure you make a reservation in advance.",

They recently took their signature coconut pie that was covered in a warm rum sauce and homemade like whipped cream off the menu! Though the food is good and the drinks are still flowing I can't say we'll be back as often as before, it made the meal.    For this location outside dining in the nicer months is a good option. The bar is nicely laid out and the big tables in the bar are first come first serve. Parking isn't limited.",

Although never seeing a Manager during our dinner, I have to say the food was great, prepared to everyone's liking. Quick and friendly service. We started our dinner with the amazing crispy, fried, spicy Bang Bang Shrimp!!, as an add on to our dinner.  I would love to have the recipe to make this at home! We also shared the Crab Cakes, delicious! We all chose the Hooked on Tues Specials. Salad, entree and dessert. The birthday girl had the Salmon dinner, I had the Ahi Tuna and her father had the Shrimp & Scallops. I chose the Ceaser Salad. It was good, but lacking in dressing. I really enjoyed the medium well Tuna, it was prepared perfectly. Everyone had the Potatoes, excellent choice. Dessert was Cheesecake with both butterscotch and chocolate sauce, very good !!! I belong to the email subscription. I have not yet joined the rewards program. We do go to Bonefish or Out Back Steak House enough to join. We gave her the points to her rewards account to get one more visit for a dinner reward.  I may consider it. We will return.",

While they don't have a huge variety of beer on tap, they do have a decent selection of craft beer bottles. We had bacon wrapped scallops which was a special appetizer for the night and the bang bang shrimp along with complimentary bread. Both of the apps were great, but we loved the bang bang shrimp. We then had the crab crusted cod and the lobster stuffed shrimp for our entrees. Both delicious as well. Although this place is a bit pricey it is worth the money. Reminds me of a seafood style \"Bravo\"/\"Brio.\" We will definitely eat here again in the future.",

A few years later and it is now completely generic with frozen, tasteless fish and salty sides.  On my most recent (and definitely my last) visit, I had a fish sandwich that was so bad that I couldn't eat it.  The server didn't ask me about my food and I didn't mention it.  So here you go...couldnt eat my horrible, foul tasting fish.  It's a mystery to me why this place is so crowded all the time.  Must be for the lack of restaurants in the area.  It's a shame.  It used to be our go-to spot for all special occasions.  Environment is inviting for a chain - 4 stars.  Service is sometimes good, but not consistent.  Bar service is super slow.  You wait forever for a cocktail, longer for a second.",

Our server was dragging his feet and roaming around the restaurant just chatting. We were out of water and didn't get refilled until we asked. The plates and utensils were all sticky. I was still eating my food and he offered to give me a box. I am extremely disappointed because we love this place.

We both started off with the fresh lemonade and let me tell you it was great and quite refreshing which is saying a lot as I usually don't even like lemonade.   Next after seeing it go by our table so many times we went with the Bang, Bang Shrimp appetizer. The shrimp were perfected cooked with just enough of a kick to keep you wanting more. They were so good I wanted to order more.   For our entrees we both went with the tacos. I had steak and the she had fish.  My tacos were so good. The steak was juicy and tender and full of flavor. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food.  Our server Melanie was great and very patient as it took us a while to decide what to order as it was our first time there.  My only complaint is that there is no Bonefish Grille on the East Side. Cough, Monroeville! Cough, The Waterfront! Hell, I'd even take one in Southside Works or Ross Park Mall!",

Hostess was friendly, waitress was friendly, servers walking around the eating area were all so friendly. I ordered off the lunch special menu, and went with the Bang Bang Tacos and chowder. Besides the tiny piece of crab shell I found in my chowder, it had good flavor and was a nice size. The tacos were fabulous. Nice crispy, large shrimp covered in a creamy spicy sauce. It was a very large portion, and I was happy with the price in comparison to the size. My husband went with the chicken teriyaki bowl. It was very large and he enjoyed it very much. They also brought us some bread with an oil and pesto dipping sauce when we first arrived. All in all it was definitely better than I expected, and I would recommend it to anyone if they ask me my opinion about it.",

Got the bang bang shrimp  only $6 on Wednesday's and $6 Wagyu beef sliders during happy hour. Amazing food for only $12!  Quick service, good vibes in the place, staff was friendly and accommodating. Bar staff was knowledgeable, attendant, and good to recommend items off the wine list. Only reason for less than 5 stars, is because I had a bad experience with entrees previously and still have a preconceived notion about the place.

The dish was flavorful and very nice looking, the noodles were just extremely al dente. I prefer my rice noodles a bit softer.   My boyfriend got the tilapia, jasmine rice and mashed potatoes and it was cooked perfectly.   I do wish they would have some variety for those of us who don't eat fish or meat, but I can understand why they don't.",

The risotto was still cold (ice cold) when I tasted the dinner. Not sure how you serve risotto very cold. I thought risotto was made to order. I can see it getting cool from sitting but this tells me they just microwave pre made shit. The server overheard me say it's ICE COLD.  She took it back. It came out 10 minutes later, after others were finished, and was the same dish only 500 degrees. Everything was LIMP. Microwaved to heat of hades. Of course I refused to eat it. Any of it. Just went to McDonald's for better quality food. At least there you know you are getting shit but not paying Bonefish prices.   I'm amazed anyone goes here with all the other options in the area.",

We called and spoke with Kevin and he kindly fixed the problem and even gave us a few items to try since we are just traveling through town.

    "text": "Unfortunately, experience will outweigh food for me on this one.  We walked in at 5:28 on a Tuesday.  The restaurant was not full at all, yet our only choice was to wait for a table in the dining room because they were \"waiting for people to get up\", or sit at a high top -- which the hostess was pushing on everyone who came in the door -- in the bar by the door where the cold will immediately hit you.  Why would I want to sit right next to the door in the middle of winter??  So we waited for about fifteen minutes when there were empty tables in the dining room.  I understand that they're very reservation oriented, but there were three six tops in my view that sat empty for the entire time we were there.  You can't tell me that you're holding a reservation for 18 or three reservations for 6 for multiple hours before they show up when there are people waiting in the lobby.  That's just not right.  And if the issue is that it's a Tuesday and you don't have all hands on deck, I guess the two managers standing around with the hostess will have to take a couple tables.    Once we were seated, our server was fine.  he was really good at paying attention to my boyfriend's iced tea level, and he made himself available without being on top of us all the time.  Our food was good, though I'd recommend not getting the mashed potatoes.  They were just meh.  But my Cosmo was delicious.  So yes, everything we ingested we were happy with.  The review is not food related at all.   But why do we have to eat in the dark?  I swear, the light level was not above nightlight.  I get that they're going for ambiance, but that was literally like trying to read a menu by candlelight.  Not favorable.  A little illumination never killed any ambiance for me.  I mean, it's not like they need big overhead fluorescents, but a couple lamps would be nice.    So on the whole, eh.  If we didn't have another $50 gift card staring at us, we probably wouldn't return.  And again, it has nothing to do with the food -- it's good, but not mind blowing.  But the waiting for a table in a half full restaurant on a Tuesday at 5:30, and then the sitting in the dark doesn't make the food good enough to put Bonefish on my list of places I MUST NOT forget about.",

That counts for something and is appreciated.  Our meal started off with fresh bread, with olive oil for dipping. Bread was amaze balls!!! That's very tasty btw!! Bang Bang shrimp for an appetizer, consisting of crispy fried shrimp with a creamy, spicy sauce, 5 stars!!!!! I had the Shrimp Pad Thai, very good, ample portion size. My friend had the Carribean Wild Mahi Mahi. It was delicious, wood fired, fresh, flaky, excellent. Sides were creamy mashed potatoes, French Green Beans, and wood fired shrimp. A great meal, I will definitely go back.",

We decided to go outside of the mall and found the bonefish Grill. I thought I found a great place to have some seafood. I knew this was a chain restaurant, but decided to try it anyway. It was absolutely terrible. Our waiter was so slow that it took him 1/2 an hour to tell us that our food would be \"a couple more minutes\". After another 15 minutes, we finally received our cold food. My friend had salad with coconut shrimp. It was cold. I had problems with scallops and a side of rice and broccoli. The scallops were hot but everything else was cold. My guy had fish tacos and they were cold. When I asked the waiter what the problem was, he said \"the scallops took longer than I thought\". Seriously? Does he know that scallops take four seconds to cook? Never again for this joint!",

    "text": "As far as a \"chain\" restaurant goes (I tend to frequent more locally owned businesses) this one is my favorite ! I should start by saying I've rarely met a filet of salmon I haven't loved.   \"Bang bang shrimp\" is what most people associate with Bomefish, and for good reason, it's delightful! A \"must\" appetizer in my opinion. Every time we come here, my boyfriend tries something different but I always stick with the same salmon filet. I LOVE IT and he's never been disappointed by any of his choices.   I do recommend making a reservation. The service is friendly and sometimes food can take some time to come out - but with the appetizer to hold you over and their delicious bread and oil, it's an enjoyable experience all the way around !",

The gin and tonic and mojito took a short amount of time (~5 minutes), but we were left waiting a bit for our food order to be taken.   Bang bang shrimp was ordered for the table and I ordered some fish tacos for my entree. The shrimp was good, although the sauce was a little sweet for my preference. The tacos were quite nice, plump with a good portion of fish as well as lots of veggies to accompany. The taste I found only okay; for how pretty and colorful the tacos were, I'd expected more flavor. However they were not bad tacos by any means, and I finished all 3 of them easily. We opted out of dessert since the dinner had run long,  but the service was friendly and we would consider coming back to try some other items on the menu!",

We arrived around 6 PM on a busy Friday evening, and we got lucky that another reservation had just canceled and they sat us right away.   Unfortunately, our server was a bit slow throughout the entire meal. It was nice to catch up with family during the long waits though! Everyone in our party enjoyed their drinks and dinner. I'd recommend trying the Chilean sea bass with any sauce, but I especially love the tomato garlic one. It sounded a bit weird to me the first time, but I crave that sauce now.

The appetizer bread is also soft and fresh. The atmosphere resembles that of a finer dining establishment, but the prices are mid range (with some menu items on the higher side). I would give this recommendation!",

    "text": "I went to the Bonefish Grill in Maryland and my experience was okay because the service was excellent, considering how busy it was.  The food was not that hot though, the scalloped potatoes were cold and undercooked. My fillet mignon was really good and lean though, crab cake was really tasty though not hot too.    Finding out they had recently opened a location in the Pittsburgh area was exciting.  I thought I could give this a place a try on a more quiet night, hoping that they could pay better attention to the food. It was incredibly packed on a Wednesday night; the wait was an hour.   We ordered the 2 for $39.9. The meal came with 3 very small cuts of ahi tuna, salmon, sea bass, as well as 2 shrimp and 2 scallops. It also included 2 salads and 2 sides (asparagus $1 extra and garlic mash potatoes) on another plate with their signature garbanzo salad.  The fish was just simply undercooked.  The ahi tuna made my stomach turn, because it was raw, and I understand that is how they do it.  It just did not sit well with me.  The texture of it was just too mushy and flavorless.  My taste buds were not very excited to work the sea bass either- salmon, I make that at home and it wasn't good either.  The scallop I ate was undercooked too.   In the end, our bill with tip came to about $60 (we got water). I'm not sure I'll ever pay that price again to wait an hour for food that is disappointing to just okay.  I might stop by for Happy Hour because the service is really good and the atmosphere is extremely nice (slightly crammed).  However, dinner would be more enjoyable, for me, somewhere cheaper and better tasting.  The 4 of us that went left agreeing that TGI Fridays would have been better and much cheaper.",

We ordered the bang bang shrimp the girl that brought it to our table scratched her head as she was serving it to us 2 shrimp fell outta the bowl and our server said \"oh no\". We weren't real real hungry so we decided on splitting the fish tacos it took over an hour for us to get them. The place was not that busy. I was watching our server because I've been a bartender for 15+ years started as a server so I watch noticed her getting mad about something. She avoided us to the point I had to ask random servers for more drinks, more if any bread & their pesto/oil that she should of given us but I spotted on other tables. Once we got our food I had to ask bartender for hot sauce. Only saving grace was the manager came over after we finished apologized said they really dropped the ball on this one & they where picking up the check for food only. Which was really cool! We never said a word to anyone, never gave our waitress a hard time, just sat there & talked! My boyfriend did get a little mad when he had to wait for 2nd bloody mary ( they are fantastic)! Now, had they not done that...he'd NEVER go back with me. I do think it's a bit pricey for 2 very small tacos! Also, all I eat is seafood been vegetarian for 17yrs :(",

We were both very pleased, I will be back. My friend left her credit card at the table and Kelsey even ran it out to us. Great waitress!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here for the first time on valentines day. We were really surprised on how slow business was for the type of holiday. Anyways, we were seated immediately and given our drinks just as fast. Unfortunately it took us a long time to decide what we wanted to eat because for a \"fish place\" there wasn't very much of it on the menu. We ordered the fried lobster dumplings which were amazing! My boyfriend ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. I opted for the crab cakes with their seasonal side of chick peas and a side salad. I got my salad and honestly even for a side salad it was extremely small. I have been in the restaurant business for over 6 years. I know that a salad is one of the least expensive things on the menu to produce. But despite this dirt cheap food cost I got about a one ounce portion of salad. Despite this I really looked forward to the entree that I had ordered. Entrees arrive at the table and my boyfriends plate looks delicious! But my plate..... Not so much. I was surprised to receive two \"baby handful size\" of crab cake mix piles and a side of chickpeas bigger then both the handfuls of crab cakes, but not by much!!!!! I should have taken pictures of my meal, Bonefish would have been embarrassed! I was starved when we got there and left hungry after our meal. I know what people are thinking. That I'm used to the over-sized portions that the culture of America has made standard in the restaurant industry. However, that is simply not the case and had I thought to take pictures those would have proven my point. Bonefish grill is not worth the money. If a chain restaurant is what you are looking for, there are better ones for the money you will spend here. And at least you won't leave hungry!",

    "text": "I was very excited to finally have a Bonefish in this area.  I lived in Orlando, and frequented the one there.  However, this one was quite disappointing.  I went there with my husband and 2 year old son.  The table cloths are paper, so my son was able to draw on the entire table....which sadly, was one of the highlights.  I ordered apple juice for him.  The waiter told me that they don't have apple juice.  Though I was kind of shocked about that, I said ok, milk will be fine.  My husband & I ordered sodas.  About 5 minutes later, he brought our drinks, minus my son's milk.  He said they were out, that someone was running to the store to get more....that turned into another 10 minutes before the milk finally arrived.  I ordered tilapia stuffed with shrimp, scallops & crabmeat.  There was maybe 3 tiny pieces of shrimp and 3 tiny scallops with hardly any crabmeat at all...very disappointing.  My husband ordered pork chops that were entirely too dry to even eat.  My son had grilled chicken...wasn't too bad...for a kids meal.  The bang bang shrimp was okay....sauce was very thick and just soaked into the breading.  Portions aren't that big for the amount you spend....way overpriced!      We will probably go back, due to the fact that there isn't a large variety of seafood restaurants in the area.",

Our waitress was not very good and seemed very scattered. Our appetizers arrived fine and were very good. We then had to wait over an hour for our entrees. It was clear that they had forgotten to place our order. Others around us arrived after us, received their food, ate and left. The waitress never followed up and finally the manager proceeded to talk to us - from 4 tables away - and never apologized. We politely told him we did not want the food and would pay our check. He said he would take care of the meal, at which time we stood up and walked out, without an apology. Other diners around us commented about how poorly we were treated. We will never, ever patronize Bonefish Grill again - what a shame.",

We waited about an hour, but given their cozy patio waiting area it wasn't unpleasant. My husband and I both enjoyed our warm bread and pesto appetizer which the server offered to us while we looked at the drink menu. I definitely recommend the blackberry elixir which is non alcoholic and delicious. A wonderful blend of coconut water seltzer water lime juice and fresh blackberries tasted refreshing on a 80 degree day. My hubby had the Thai iced tea which to me tasted like a iced chai tea. For dinner I had the   Seared ahi tuna Tokyo style, which was basically the dinner portion of their ahi tuna appetizer. It was served with sweet rice and sauteed veggies alongside with some sir racha and a flavorful soy sauce, wasabi and ginger. I definitely recommend this dish if you are into sushi or like ahi tuna, it was full of flavor. My hubby had the fish tacos and said they were delicious as well. We ate outdoors, but ventured inside briefly. Very nice ambiance inside and staff was very good with time and very helpful when we asked questions. As far as price goes, entrees are on par with somewhere like Atrias. I was expecting a $50 dinner after we ordered all we did, and given the feel and look of the place and was surprised to see our bill was only about $35 for the both of us. Overall, loved this Restaraunt and will definitely come back.",

We visited about 4:30 on a Saturday, it was crowded but we were seated in about 45 minutes.  Our waitress was very good and prompt to our table.  We order a calamari appetizer which was very good with a delicious dipping sauce, but after that the experience went downhill fast.  We waited a long time to receive our dinners.  Several nearby tables who were seated after us received their entrees before us.  We were not in a hurry but it was frustrating.  Our meals did arrive and looked appetizing.  My salmon was a a little dry, but overall tasty.  My wife really enjoyed her shrimp and scallops, though her green beans were undercooked and tough.  My son's fish and chips had an off flavor, I am not sure what was wrong but he did not finish it.  Our overall experience was decent, but this restaurant needs to do better if they would like us to be regular customers.",

    "text": "This was my first trip to the Bonefish Grill. I had heard horrible stories of long wait times, but at 8 on a Friday night the wait was just about 15 minutes. Comparable, if not less, than other comparable places.   Three words: bang bang shrimp. The appetizer alone is reason enough to stop by. Close to a dozen fresh shrimp (grilled maybe?) then rolled in heavenly crunchy goodness that is somewhat like a breading, but crispy, and better. Then the sauce- a creamy spicy sauce that hits the spot. I measure all appetizers against the crispy fried alligator at Nola on the Square- this rivals, if not surpasses, that (very similar in sauce).  I had the fish tacos.  I order fish tacos everywhere and I was a bit hesitant because it describes it as Cajun seasoned, which I don't tend to like.  If Cajun is what you want, that isn't what you will get. I was pleased. It is topped with a mango salsa that is pretty great. I highly recommend the fish tacos. I was disappointed in my side- I chose the spring greens. It was a pile of lettuce drowned in balsamic. I should have gone with the chips, but tried to go healthy. Just a little overdressed and plain.  I mixed it with a Thai iced tea- amazing. I could become addicted to the creamy, sweet, yet slightly spicy concoction.   My companion ordered a shrimp pasta diablo dish. Sweet at first, the heat eventually hits you. I recommend it.   The reviews talking about slow service are well warranted. 15 min to take our beverage order seemed a bit much. However, the attentiveness improved as the meal progressed (and the restaurant cleared out).  We will be going back, the fish selection looks pretty great and so does the dessert menu.",

Cons: However, don't go very hungry-- LONG wait, very small portions for price- 4 very small scallops and 4 smaller sized  shrimp for almost $17.  Grilled fish, shrimp and scallops had very little flavor- completely forgettable.  Fish tacos had same completely forgettable fish.  Nothing special.  Atmosphere was cramped and loud.

The corn chowder with lobster on top was probably the best soup I've had. The filet was cooked just perfect. I had lobster meat on top which was good also. The Ahi tuna appetizer was soooo delicious! It melted in my mouth, but had a great peppery seared crusty outside. Flash seared to keep it rare. Made to perfection. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because our drinks, although presented very nicely, tasted like Kool Aid...pretty much no alcohol-and for $9 a drink, I would like to taste my liquor lol! Service was a little slower than if prefer, but since I know the ways of the concept, this place likes to space out their times between courses to let you soak in all the flavors...and order more drinks, which we switched to wine. Can't go wrong there :-). They take reservations, which I suggest on a weekend of course, as they are pretty busy then. They also have outdoor seating, which I always prefer on nights like this. It was the Fourth of July of course! And from this location...bonus...you can see Upper St. Clair's fireworks from the outdoor seating area!!",

    "text": "Great Service! First time at a Bonefish Grill.  We went on a Thursday evening at 5 and were asked if we had reservations.  We didn't , and they did get us a seat immediately, but it got very busy by the time we left.  I recommend reservations! When we left the waiting area was packed, but they were walking around with free appetizers for sampling, very nice touch. Having never been before, we completely relied on our waiter for menu helps.  We got all the things he suggested and were very pleased! Bang Bang Shrimp for appetizer's crispy crusted shrimp in a spicy cream sauce....didn't sound so good, but was wonderful!!!!  ( He said on Wednesdays they have Bang Bang specials on everything for $5 which is a good deal) For dinner I had the Kobe beef burger (yes a hamburger) and it was truly phenomenal.  My husband had one of the specials which was a haddock, grilled with feta and artichokes and he also thought it was great. The wait staff were always coming by and clearing the table or refilling drinks, bringing bread with pesto sauce.  Our waiter was very personable and friendly, never had to wait on anything.  Really enjoyed our visit.  We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "We had a \"Date Night\" meal here on a Sunday Afternoon @ 4:00. Great timing! The restaurant was pleasantly \"full\"--no one seated near us but enough people to keep it interesting. We were seated at a pub table in the bar area--very cool! It was also Happy Hour, making a glass of wine .26 cents more than a soda! Hardly a decision to think about. Will be back during Happy Hour. We started off with the Lobster Flat Bread. So delicious!! I am a health nut & I do not feel like this appetizer contradicted my healthy diet. I did not eat the bread & oil, but my hubby loved it. I ordered the small portion of Chilean Sea Bass (my fave!!) & it was delicious. Shared with my hubby who got the Grilled Scallops & Shrimp. We were able to sample 2 sauces each. Pan-Asian Sauce was our favorite out of the four. Sides were great. We did not leave room for dessert--or I would have had a forkful of Key Lime Pie! So looking forward to our next visit!",

    "text": "The wife and I go up to the Independence, Ohio one all the time. We don't mind the trip. So when we saw one was opening here we flipped!!!  We went a couple weeks after opening. Going in, I knew it was not going to be perfect. No biggie. When we walked in, the girl the took our names was, putting it bluntly, a bitch to us and, as we waited at the bar, to other people as well. Didn't care or too good for that.... We waited for about forty five minutes for a table. No biggie. We got a table, had a wonderful dinner  and could not wait to go back. The place lost a star because of her.   Fire her and you get five stars from me. Totally unprofessional. I was going to say something to the manager but I didn't want to ruin the mood.",

    "text": "Finally checked out Bonefish Grill tonight. Things started off good.  Server was nice and informative. Appetizer came out in like 2 minutes. More into dinner, the service was good but seemed robotic. Bang bang shrimp was good. Our salads were underwhelming. When are dinner arrived, we both ordered crab cakes, we were definitely not impressesd. Taste was ok but portions are pretty small. There was also something in the remoulade that didn't taste great. To end our dinner our server said all he asked is that we don't steal his pen?  Really?!  All in all the food was good but underwhelming. I'm not rushing back.",

    "text": "The food here is excellent!  I had the coconut shrimp and fish tacos.  Both were incredibly flavorful and nicely prepared.  The decor and waitstaff need some work.  Our waiter was extremely annoying and unknowledgeable.  When we first sat down he spent 10 minutes talking about how Bonefish was better than all the competitors in the area (and that he had worked for all the competitors).  Then retold us about the competitors while he was telling me about the specials this made me feel like I was in a discount steak place.  Then he incorrectly answered many questions we had about (for example we asked about certain seasonings, amounts included in orders and prices---he was incorrect on all accounts). I was also disappointed that they had plastic table coverings---seemed tacky.  Great food tho.",
