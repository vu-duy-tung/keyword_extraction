    "text": "This is actually a Cambodian restaurant and one of the most authentic Asian restaurants you will find anywhere. The curry is amazing. They roast their own herbs and create their own curry rather than simply mixing a powder or paste. They've got a number of more familiar dishes to appeal to the unadventurous but do yourself a favor and eat your way through the menu. The Cambodian family that runs this has had at least 3 other restaurants going back almost 20 years, and this is the one they have most poured their heart into. Don't confuse it with the Cambodian Kitchen next door (an unfortunate trick of geography) which sells Asian food and kielbasa...nuf said.",

I have been living in the area since they opened and I must say the young gentleman that works their (seems to be owners son) is very professional and friendly.  I have come in on several occasions both during the day and late-night.  The food is always good. The only negative thing that I have to say is that my last few visits the food has been somewhat disappointing.  It seems obvious when the owner/cook is making the food.  There is a lot of room for improvement.  On this note, I used to always love getting their calamari.  It was always nicely seasoned, light and crispy.  But the last few times it has been bland, heavy and greasy.  :(  The food here has a lot of potential and room for improvement.  I will still come back and recommend it to people.  But if I don't see improvements I will stop.",

Both times we've visited we have left with plenty of food for another complete meal. Finally, the garnishes are works of art, carrots have never looked that good.  Definitely worth a try!",

I love spicy food, so I always ask to get my Pad Thai as spicy as it can be. However, some places never make it hot enough which is frustrating. This place definitely listened and made it exactly how I like it and the flavor was awesome. It was also a huge plate for only $11.00.   The woman working there was also super friendly and even though I only got take-out, I noticed the pretty restaurant decor on my way out.   Next time I am going to go to eat there rather than just get take-out. I would definitely recommend it.",

Inside was beautiful and bright. Not what I expected... It was very elegant looking. I'd like to eat inside sometime. It was totally empty though. I would hope around dinner time it might fill up a little...  I love spicy food and usually order a 9 or 10 on the spicy scale as most places never make it that spicy. I got my pad thai at a 9 and it was almost too hot for me to handle, so order a few notches down from what you normally would.   My noodle dish came with soup and a veggie egg roll. I picked wonton. Soup had one wonton in it and was just okay, but then again I always think wonton soup is just okay. Egg roll was tiny, like the size of my thumb, but I didn't mind because the size of the rest of my meal was larger than expected.   Large noodle dish (plenty to split or have leftovers), soup, and an egg roll for less than ten bucks.  I'll order here again.",

I mean there wasn't a scrap of sauce to be found on those sad, barren rice noodles.   They also forgot the noodles in my fiance's CURRY NOODLES, and they put egg in the fried rice even though we asked for no egg (I'm allergic).  When we called to explain there were mistakes in our order, the girl on the phone didn't put us on hold but proceeded to discuss the situation with her manager very audibly, though somewhat muffled as she made an attempt to place her hand over the mouthpiece.   They asked if we wanted to exchange the food...as in return the wrong orders in exchange for the corrected orders...very odd since this is a restaurant, not a clothing store.  We drove back down there, got our replacement food but sadly that couldn't redeem our meal.   The food was just terrible.  The fried rice was really oily and chock full of red pepper flakes.  The crispy tofu triangles didn't, well, taste like tofu.  The crispy breading fell off them and then we were left with a really tough, chewy, McDonalds chicken-nugget-like blob.  I can't really explain it but it wasn't edible. Maybe I just don't have a refined enough palate for Cambodian food? Think I'll stick with Lin's Asian Fusion next time I want Carson Street Asian cuisine.",

Our \"waiter\" was the owner and he checked on/chatted with us and even brought out his mother, the chef. It just made the whole experience even better knowing this nice family was running the restaurant together.

It is a really cute spot... awesome for a date night.  The colors, decor, etc. all is wonderful. The service was great... she was super attentive and kind... and we never had empty waters (which is always a way to score brownie points with us).  The lunch prices were great too... 7.95-8.95 for a lunch combo where you get your choice of soup and a veggie spring roll is a good deal if you ask me.  We also ordered the fresh spring roll with tofu app which was awesome.  The sauce was yummy too.  I got the Chicken and Broccoli which was great... the sauce on it was better than most that I have ever had.  The hubby got the Pad Thai w/ Chicken and he seemed to enjoy it quite a bit as well.

My favorite is an Apsara original, pad Thai fusion, it's pad Thai with your choice of curry, either Panang (my favorite) red, or green curry. Last night I got a season special, butternut squash coconut soup! It was AMAZING!! The waitress is so nice there as well, very attentive but not overbearing. I plan on trying the more adventurous selections next time! Last night we also got their calamari, light and crispy with a delicious dipping sauce. The calamari could have been bigger. It's also a great location right in south side, one of the few places with outdoor seating! Always my first choice for Thai! Would like to see it be more busy!",

When my party entered sunday evening the waiter approched carrying food for another table. He looked at us sadly. I asked if we should seat ourselves anywhere. He shrugged as if he didnt care one way or the other and why would I think he would.  We should have taken the hint but we stayed, and it actually got kind of funny.    I guess Cambodian is probably their specialty but they serve Thai and Chinese and fusion.  I ordered Mee Bompong, a Cambodian dish.  He came back shortly  \"We're out of C15\"  lol.   I ordered something else.  As I say the food was OK. I've certainly had better and more authentic Thai but my companions were happy with theirs.  I asked for Nam Pla Prick, the ubiquitous Thai condiment of fish sauce with sliced chilis. He gave me the stare and I explained what it was.   Maybe he'd had a bad day.  Maybe his dog had died.  By the end of the evening I was wondering if we were on a hidden camera show.",

As someone who loves both all things spicy and Eastern, Apsara Cafe certainly caught my intrigue.  I had grabbed a takeout menu from a very nice host, and later ordered the Panang curry.  There was so much!  Definitely worth the price, as leftovers are guaranteed.  This curry starts at a 4 spice, but I was able to request a 10, as I most usually do when going out for Thai or other similar cuisine.  It was definitely spicy!  This of course was fine with me, as I love my curries this way.  I was also able to request steamed tofu rather than fried.  Great customer service, and a tasty meal!  I'm sure I'll be back.",

The reason that it does not have a packed dining room is the location.  Yes, Carson St is a hoppin place Thursday through Sat night, but those wanting a great dining experience are not going to fight the South Side crowds, and parking, to go out to eat.  But, they should.  Go, find someplace to park, and you will be so glad that you did.  If Apsara were located in NYC it you wouldn't be able to get a table.    I can't wait to go back !!",

Unlike typical Thai restaurants, Apsara sets itself apart in that it also offers Cambodian food-probably one of the few places in Pittsburgh that has such an offering.    The actual restaurant is unlike that of the surround neighborhood: clean, neat, quiet, and somewhat romantic!  The service is friendly and timely.  Menu selection is robust; pricing is competetive with that of other Thai restaurants in the city.    We started our meal off with fresh spring rolls.  They were large, had plenty of tofu stuffed inside and came with perfectly crafted peanut sauce.  Very very solid.   For my main meal I ordered the Cambodian rice noodle pasta with Tofu, veggies and what appeared to be pad thai sauce.  Unlike traditional pad thai, the noodles were softer and larger.  The dish was fresh, tasty, and dare I saw somewhat more satisfying than a traditional pad thai.   Overall the meal was great, the service was solid.  A few notable deficits: 1.) their hot sauce level request is absolutely pathetic.  When I ask for an 8/10, I expect my food to actually taste spicy, not sweet.  2.) why would you hide the chopsticks and make me request them?  Come on!  Beyond that, this restaurant is a great addition to the area and I highly recommend you check it out.  I was also intrigued to see that from Thurs-Sat, the restaurant is open until 4AM.  Something to consider...",

    "text": "*sniffle* That's not a runny nose due to spiciness, it's a sad sniffle. I really wanted to like this place...   I heard great reviews of Apsara and as a huge Thai food fan, I couldn't wait to give it a try! On a Friday night, a friend and I decided to order takeout. Since this restaurant is Cambodian/Thai fusion, their menu is extensive. When trying a new Thai place, I tend to order some of the same dishes that I get at every Thai restaurant. In my book, it's the easiest way to compare and rank the food. I liked the options on Apsara's menu but I stuck to my usual...to start, I had fresh spring rolls (cold, non-fried) and the Apsara healthy soup. For my entree, I ordered the veggie drunken noodles, medium spice level. My friend ordered the fresh spring rolls and spicy mixed veggies with rice.   I realize ordering takeout is a poor way to judge the service but I have to say that the waiter who processed my order was incredibly dry. He didn't know the menu when I asked for clarification and his lack of enthusiasm did not entice me to come in for a sit down meal.   After the lackluster interaction with the waiter, I was pleased to find that our spring rolls were bagged separate. This made me very happy since I've ordered Thai takeout too many times where the cold and hot food was bagged together. The spring rolls were cold & fresh but lacked a punch to the palate. Minimal basil with a lot of cheap chopped iceberg didn't sit well with me. I used a lot of the peanut sauce to add flavor to every bite. Next up, the Apsara healthy soup. This was tasty & I would order it again. The flavors pulled through and the vegetables were slightly crunchy & not overcooked. It was a light, nice portion size for an appetizer. After the soup, I had high hopes for the drunken noodles. Wow, was I wrong. I hate to say it but it tasted like the dish was cooked in water. It had the right coloring but the only flavor I got was biting into the vegetables. I tried mixing up the sauce from the bottom of the container and no luck. No spice, no spark of flavor in the sauce and the vegetables couldn't save it. My friend didn't have a variety of spices so I added salt & pepper to salvage it. The veggies and noodles were not overcooked but I was looking for a distinct flavor. My friend wasn't thrilled with her dish for the same reasons but was pleased by the spice level. They at least added a punch of chili pepper to hers.   I'm not sure if I will give Apsara another shot. Thai me up is a few blocks away and while they are not my #1 for Thai (Nicky's or Pusadee's are my favorite) I have never had a flavorless dish from Thai me up. I see so many good reviews for Apsara so I hope this was just an off night for the staff.",

Girlfriend ordered cambodian rice noodles, and I ordered tofu red curry. Both had nice flavors--the rice noodles were sweet, tofu was cooked well.  They asked us how spicy we would like our dishes to be on a scale of 1 to 10. I somewhat overzealously asked for an 8 and they honored my request. It was quite spicy (I was able to finish it, but there was a little pain involved).  I was impressed by the spiciness (especially since the dish didn't have any visible chili flakes).   Nice intimate decor and lots of natural lighting.   We also got mango sticky rice-- that was good, but not life-changing (and a little expensive).",

It was already past closing time on a Friday night, but they were selling some fast street food outside the door and the kitchen was still open, so they accommodated us with a table inside. Their menu has a good mix of both Thai and Cambodian dishes.  We got a Moarn Chha Kroeung, which is their original stir fry of vegetables (plus a protein) in a lemongrass sauce, as well as a Lot Chha noodle. The portion sizes were quite large. The former was pretty tasty, though maybe with a bit too much sauce. The noodle was really good, with the short spongy rice noodles standing out.  If we got Thai food I wouldn't call it the best around, but for Cambodian dishes I would come back for more.",

Kay was in command, so she chose the Bacon-Wrapped Scallops. A tart, micro-salad of greens, allumetted cucumber, and ornately cut carrots served as a bed for the trio of brackish, saccharine bits of plump, pork-draped, skewered mollusks. Whet the appetite they did.   My entree consisted of something called Saramann. Similar in texture to a beef or lamb curry, the supple, cubed tenderloin bobbed up and down in the sweet, milky, lightly acidic pool of brown gravy that held whole roasted peanuts coconut, star anise, cloves, cinnamon, lemon grass, kaffir lime leaves, shallots, and garlic. As I spooned the sweet, meaty brew onto the fluffy mounds of white rice, I was once again reminded of how similar cuisines from around the globe can be and was left wondering who borrowed from whom.   A four-piece \"dessert sampler\" included the following: Golden Balls, Black Sweet Rice, Sweet Rice Cake, and Pumpkin Custard. The Golden Balls were a take on the Indian treat known as Gulab Jamun with its spongy cake and syrupy, fruity topping. The Pumpkin Custard was the densest. The rice cakes were an exercise in contrast -- the black sweet rice coming off as licorice-like while the sweet rice was rather mild. A highly engrossing quartet of confection, each morsel was a welcome detour from the rich, extravagant desserts I've grown accustomed to.   With yuppies, hipsters, and blue-collar folk enjoying themselves inside or skipping in and out with takeaway bags as we dined, it was apparent how Apsara has quickly and comfortably entrenched itself into East Carson's restaurant scene. Like sushi, Thai fare is no longer trendy and exotic; it's becoming a part of Americana. And for that, I am gladdened, establishments such as Apsara broadening tastes with ease, grace and a sense of tradition and hospitality.  P.S. We had the dining room to ourselves for the first few minutes of our meal. Business soon perked up quite nicely on a weeknight no less.",

We really enjoyed our meals here!!   See Ew noodles with beef is my usual thai food order. They were delicious! They have a good amount of sauce and come with mixed veggies!  I loved that they came with stir fried veggies- it added more to the dish. I did not add a spice level to my order, so it was not spicy. I would definitely order this again, but the rest of the menu also looked delicious, so I might have to branch out!  My boyfriend order the red curry scallops. Neither of us had had a curry meal with scallops before. They were very good! It was served with rice and lots of scallops! We split the short rib appetizer. The sauce on the beef was really tasty!   All of the portion sizes were good! We had a great service. Our waiter was very friendly and gave great recommendations! We will definitely return to try more of the menu!",

The spice level does fluctuate however. They measure the spice level from 1-10 and ask you what number you want before you order. Every time I've been there it has been different. There have been times where a number 8 spicy was unbearably hot and other times where it was hardly noticeable. But besides that it is a solid spot for Thai/Cambodian cuisine. The atmosphere is okay if you are into Hindu gods everywhere. Service fluctuates with who the personnel is. I've been disappointed at times but most of the time it's solid.",

    "text": "So after having a fantastic dinner at Cure early in the evening, my friend from college and I headed down to Carson St to check out the Saturday night life.  For some damn reason, I wanted to eat again at midnight, haha.  As we walked by Apsara Cafe, a little old Asian lady spotted us, and came outside to encouraged us to enter.  Being two AZNs (my friend and I), it's hard to walk away from an old lady promoting her food.  In case you didn't know, if you have little old Asian women, you'll usually get great food.   Food (8.25/10) = So we pretty much just asked what she recommended.  Two dishes.  Chicken pad thai and chicken red curry.  Both winners.  Don't know how this place compares to other thai places in Pittsburgh, but this restaurant does serve delicious food regardless.  Surprisingly what impressed me the most was the clean crisp hot tea they served.  Usually the Asian restaurants serve the cheap tasting stuff, but the tea was probably the part of my second dinner I enjoyed the most, hah.   Ambiance (9.0/10) = One of the nicest thai restaurant I've visited.  The decor is beautiful in my opinion.  The art work.  The figures of elephants and other animals surrounding the walls of the restaurant caught my attention.    Service (9.0/10) = old asian lady with hospitality.  Anthony Bourdain knows this.  He talks about it in one of the numerous episodes where he visits Vietnam.  Old smiling asian lady = hospitality = delicious food = like a second mother.  Overall Opinion = I came here for a second dinner.  Why?  I still don't know.  I wasn't hungry.  I had dined at Cure early in the evening where I indulged myself in meat.  Was it the old smiling Asian lady?  Perhaps.  Bottom line is, the chicken pad thai, the chicken red curry, and the tea were Double D - Damn Delicious, even with having a full stomach of cured meats, haha.",

I know it's replete with restaurants and stores, so I was knew it wouldn't make for a boring afternoon. I decided on Apsara Cafe. I'm a fan of Southeast Asian cuisine.  Apsara didn't disappoint. When I walked in there were only two other patrons in the restaurant. I soon ended up being their only customer. The dining rom is very open, bright and clean.  I settled in, browsed the menu, and choose the chicken panang dish from the lunch entree menu. Wanted to stretch my dollars. It comes with soup (I chose Lemongrass and a vegetable spring roll). The soup was very flavorful but I didn't care for all the tomato chunks. The ratio between soup and veggies was off.  My main dish came out and it was delish, delish! The portion too was spot on. Was even able to take some home. My server even gave me an extra, small container of rice when she boxed up my leftovers.  I'll definitely be back.",

Served in a crispy basket filled with green papaya pickles, ginger and garlic.  You know when you go to get crummy Chinese or shady pan-Asian at the grungy and run-down why-has-it-been-in-business-since-I-moved-to-town place around the corner and you know that what you're ordering will only end up being a poor reflection, a sad afterthought, an abhorrent attempt at replication of what you really wish you could order; yet you order it anyway, and everyone involved ends up slightly gassy and unfulfilled?  Apsara Cafe's grilled beef short ribs represent what all of those awful places are attempting to emulate unsuccessfully.  Usually, when I go to write a review, I like to browse first to see what other people had to say--so I won't say what's already been said (nice restaurant, nice atmosphere, okay service, blah, blah, blah). I agree with Rachel C. and wholly support her 2-star experience. However, I wonder if she tried the grilled beef short ribs.  Apsara Cafe gets four stars because of the grilled beef short ribs and the grilled beef short ribs only. Frankly, I don't really care about anything else on the menu. It's all pretty tasty but at the same time fairly forgettable. Except for those grilled beef short ribs. Grilled beef short rib God came down from grilled beef short rib heaven and gave us His grilled beef short rib goodness through the grilled beef short rib preachings of the chefs at Apsara. I could waste an entire paycheck on multiple orders of them and only feel slightly ashamed.  Seriously.",

The serve was very carefree like she could take it or leave it so I will not be back I'll try the place next door I heard it was better but when here because they were close",

I'm not saying that this is the best Thai food I've ever had or that it stands out, but it is very good - and combined with a wonderful mix of modern furniture with traditional decor and tasteful presentation of the dishes - it will be an enjoyable night out!   Also, there's these cool tables up in the front kinda on a stage, but surrounded in curtains that have windows out to the street, so you're like on display but also secluded and it would make a really cool first date spot!",

    "text": "I was not impressed with this place when they first opened about two years ago. I came with my cousin for lunch and thought the entire experience was mediocre and never felt impelled to return.. Until, a friend of mine told me they have pad Thai fusions......  Yes... Pad Thai mixed with curry! What!!?!??! I had to return and try this magic! We came on a Thursday around 1- it was deserted. We sat at one of the cute tables right by the window, so we could people watch- naturally, it's southside. Our server was extremely friendly!   I was very impressed with the fact that their lunch specials come with soup AND a spring roll. Pretty sweet! I ordered the lemongrass soup- delicious, baby mushrooms and tomatoes in a spicy broth- perfection! The spring roll was mediocre and was not served with a lot of dipping sauce, so I improvised and dipped the egg roll in the soup! Delish!   As for my entree, I ordered the tofu pad Thai fusion of course! The curry that I mixed with the pad Thai was panang curry. Oh my goodness... So let me say, I've been to my fair share of Thai restaurants and I never finish my lunches, ever. I always have to take some home. This portion was large but I ate all of it! It was so good! The flavors were awesome ! Not spicy but packed with flavor! The tofu was not cooked the way I prefer- it was pretty squishy, but I notice that most restaurants do not know how to prepare tofu correctly.   I will return for more of the Pad Thai fusion!",

It is definitely a beautiful restaurant with a very calming atmosphere. Being there and seeing all the Apsara paintings made me nostalgic of my days spent in Cambodia. However, for a restaurant located in Southside, there wasn't much business.   The service was wonderful and the food came out quickly. I ordered the curry noodle bowl with green curry. It was pretty much rice noodle and vegetables in a coconut curry sauce. The curry sauce was creamy and super tasty on the first bite, but I quickly got sick of the creaminess and could not finish my bowl. Also, the rice noodle was too mushy and overcooked. My eating companions got the pad thai and the pad thai fusion. The pad thai was a bit too bland and again the noodle was too mushy. The pad thai fusion came drenched in curry sauce, but the sauce was way too sweet.   Overall, the food okay (I have had worst), but just okay (I also have had better). I'm only giving it three stars because it lacks that authenticity that I crave--less sugar and more fish sauce please!",

They had a stand outside their restaurant selling finger foods (satay, vegetable kabobs) to the most-likely intoxicated passers-by. We stopped for a few seconds to look, when a cute little old Asian lady came outside immediately to greet us and welcome us in. We turned her down initially, but came crawling back soon after. Whether it was guilt from saying no to a lady who resembled our grandmothers, good salesmanship or just plain old hunger, we walked in and it turned out to be a great decision.   The physical space and ambiance was nice compared to the other seemingly squalid storefronts on Carson. From the tables and chairs to the hardwood floor, everything looked new. Aspsara is also decorated with small fixtures and artwork which adds a nice touch. The service was good. The lady welcomed us with open arms even when they were officially closed according to their displayed hours. Our orders were taken promptly and waters were refilled constantly. We were treated like family. The food was also on point and I doubt I could find any better Thai/Cambodian food in Pittsburgh at 11 pm on a Saturday. We ordered the Chicken Red Curry and Chicken Pad Thai to share. They were not the best dishes I've ever had, but they were still very flavorful and portions were large. Apsara Cafe is definitely a Thai restaurant you should check out if you're in the area.",

This was not a palate party by any means. Just another Thai place... for now at least.  They ARE brand new, so I will give them that, but coming into an empty restaurant does not bode well. The place was deserted. And it's remodeled so well! It really looks amazing inside. Beautiful wood floors, nice tables and chairs and a very inviting environment all around. But when you hear your chair scrap across the floor as you're sitting down, you know it's too quiet in there.   I was excited to see a handful of noodle dishes on the list, so I went with the N1 Kuteiv Chha (Phnom Penh - Flat Oriental wheat flour noodles sauteed with Chinese broccoli leaves, fresh bean sprouts, eggs and scallions in Phnom Penh sauce). As I said, it just wasn't very flavorful. I could have done with some more broccoli and bean sprouts too. Plus, the sauce was a little too thin and drippy. They did give you a good amount of shrimp, which I enjoy. I hate when they scrimp on the shrimp!  I wouldn't be opposed to going back, but it would definitely not be my first choice either.",

Went in during prime dinner time on a Friday night and there wasn't really anyone else there. By the time we left, another group came in, but it wasn't busy at all. At our table we had Pad See Yew, Drunken Noodles, and another chicken dish that I just can't remember :/  Our server didn't ask the spice level but when we mentioned it, she took it down. Actually, I sadly have to say that the service was the worst part of our experience. Unfortunately, she was borderline rude, really unhelpful with recommendations, and just generally disinterested in our table.   The food was sadly less than mediocre Thai. My shrimp see yew was the worst of the three. Something was really off there. It tasted like no see yew that I have ever had, and I use that dish as kind of my standard go-to when measuring Thai places against each other. We won't be going back, which is a shame because it's very close to where we live.",
