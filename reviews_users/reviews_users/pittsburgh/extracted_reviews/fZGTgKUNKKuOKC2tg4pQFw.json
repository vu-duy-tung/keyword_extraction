The goat biriyani is a must try, the naan was amazing, so was the malai kofta. We liked the complimentary papad in the beginning. It was our anniversary dinner and the quality of the food was perfect for the occasion. The only downside is probably the location, which becomes lonely at night. Apart from that, all are 5 stars! A very authentic eastern Indian / Bangladeshi food. Highly recommended.",

The buffet looked like it had been there all day, not a god sign.  Lady with baby took my order for samosas, chicken korma, another chicken dish and naan.  I paid, and she told me it would take 20 minutes.  I came back half an hour later and had to wait another 15 minutes at least.  The two staff who were there with their baby were super nice (the lady even brought me complimentary tea), so I waited patiently.  Several hours later when I got home (70 miles away), I was surprised to find my chicken korma was in the form of whole bone-in chicken thighs!  In all my years of eating Indian food, this was a first.  The chicken dishes, which I ordered 8/10 spice level, were totally bland.  But even this I could overlook, as the naan and samosas were fine.  What I can't overlook were the glass shards I found in my \"to go\" lassi (which was packed in a plastic food container that I also did not open until several hours later, as I left it to chill in the fridge when I got home).  HOW DOES GLASS-- A LOT OF GLASS-- END UP IN A DRINK???  By the time I called the restaurant,  there was no answer on the other end, so I could not even ask.  I just hope what I drank on my first sip does not cause me serious harm.  Tomorrow I will call to see what possible explanation they could possibly have.",

I was in the mood for something spicy, so after looking over the menu I decided to go with what looked to be the spiciest thing on the menu, the Chicken Vindaloo, which apparently is a south Indian dish, known for being quite spicy.  I was a little surprised when I was asked what level of spicy I wanted the dish, kind of having assumed based on the menu that it was pre-determined.  Nonetheless, seven out of ten was my answer as I knew that south Indian food can be pretty intense.  When the dish came out it was very flavorful, and an average size portion for the price ($10.99), but there was absolutely no heat at all, which was pretty disappointing.  I'll give this place another try though as the overall quality was there.",

Although it had amazing reviews, me, my sister and brother in law were a lil skeptical as we were going for Indian Punjabi kinda food to a Bangladeshi place. But one review about the desserts being excellent, was enough to convince my brother in law, that this was the place. We reached around 3 ish. They still had the buffet. But chicken korma was a lil cold. The chef/ manager made fresh chicken korma for us and brought it to the table . How nice!  Each curry was delicious: LIP SMACKING! Every curry had a unique flavor. And the desserts, just perfect. And to add to it, the service was par excellence. I can't wait to to drive through Pittsburgh again so that I can eat here: this place took me and my sister down the memory lane to our most favorite eating joint back home in India.  So if you are in this area and feel like having some Indian, look no further: this is the place!!",

Service was gracious and helpful, food was tasty and abundant. We got an order of (2) veggie samosas for our app - they hit the spot. And speaking of spots, the naan, ordered at our server's recommendation, hit the sweet spot. Our server (who may have also been the owner) lit up with pride when we praised our dishes - which we did, repeatedly. He clearly took considerable pride in his establishment, and rightly so. For entrees: the co-diner got the vegetarian aloo Gobi, and pronounced it among the best she'd ever had. I had a comparable reaction to my  goat korma. I always like to see a goat entree on a menu, but only rarely do. Here, I counted at least 4 goat entrees, prepared in a wide variety of styles.  All in all, a first-rate dining experience, made all the more welcome because it was so unexpected.",

The food is absolutely delicious and is the main selling point; this is the tastiest Indian restaurant food I have had in the US. The service is great, although sometimes slow. Portions are generous and the price is extremely reasonable. They even give you a papad with chutney for free while you are waiting!  There is one complaint I have, however; I almost changed my rating to 4 because of this. I have written this elsewhere before, so I'm copying and pasting: They serve rice with almost every dish and do not allow substitutions. To be fair, this appears to be the general practice in all Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I've been to; this is remarkably pointless and inauthentic. It makes absolutely no sense to serve rice with a majority of the dishes on the menu, especially the dry dishes. If you work at Bangal Kabab and you are reading this, I sincerely suggest that you allow your customers to replace the rice with some basic butter naan. If that is too expensive for you, at least include an option to upgrade the rice to naan for a small price.",

They did not even bring out fresh naan once during the 45 minutes I spent there. To add insult to injury, when I went to check out they informed me that the price is now $10 instead of the $8 it had been for the past six months; this change in pricing was not advertised anywhere as far as I could tell. $10 would not be unfair (although certainly not a bargain) if the quality were what it used to be, but for what I got today it was a total ripoff.",

    "text": "I finally, FINALLY tried this place after seeing a bunch of 5 star reviews and hearing an over the top recommendation from my roommate. Since we have the same tastes, I decided to go ahead and make the trek down the grimey streets of South Oakland to find this place.  First things first, the place is tiny. As in, I'm only 5'5 and I felt like I had to duck into the doorway tiny. There was an extreme lack of extravagant Indian decor that I have come to know and love from other Indian restaurants in the area. The bright orange paint didn't feel as refined as the decor at Yuva Indian, but the place was spotless so I'll take that over ambiance any day.   Secondly, the service was just fine, but I don't expect much in the way of Asian buffets. As long as I get a hello and a refill on water when I need it I'm pretty much good to go. There was some cool music playing when I walked in and an Asian gentleman next to me was singing along to it, which only added to the ambiance in my book.   Lastly, for being a buffet, the food was excellent. I have never had such flavorful food from a buffet line before. Typically foreign dishes are watered down and bland on a buffet, but my goodness they tasted like they were all made to order. I tried some dishes that I thought I straight up didn't like because they've been so tasteless at other joints, but I enjoyed most of the vegetarian options here and was very very pleased the taste and texture of the meat dishes. I was seriously shocked.   In my opinion, the flavorful buffet puts this place world's ahead of anything offered elsewhere in the area. I may even place this spot over Tamarind due to the wider array of options. My only complaint is how warm the place was. It was a muggy day out and I felt there was no circulation in the dining room.   There is a $10 minimum charge rule and the place is DEFINITELY too small to accommodate large groups.",

    "text": "Great food - spotty service  This is a fantastic hole-in-the wall type of place that I love. 8-9 tables and a waiter. Clean, but DIY.    Food - We had dinner - a la carte, not buffet. For apps we had the excellent veggie samosa - hot, freshly fried with lots of different vegetables in a bit of sauce. Some places put too much potato, but this was an excellent example. We ordered a second round.   The naan is excellent. Crispy, light and chewy with a ton of clarified butter.   For dinner we ordered the chicken tikka masala, lamb rogan josh, and chick peas. The server offered us spiced heat on a scale of 1-10. We chose 5 but it came out closer to 7 (in my opinion) so manage your selection accordingly.  The chicken was smoky and the tomato sauce nice and thick. The rogan josh had small chunks of lamb, and the brown sauce had a nice hint of ginger. Both of these standard-bearer dishes will not disappoint. The chick peas were unremarkable with a more watery sauce which was over spiced - closer to an 8.   When we ordered dinner we also ordered mango and salt lassi. For some reason the server didn't want to bring them during dinner - maybe I missed the memo that in Bangladesh they are to be consumed as dessert. After asking twice he did bring them after he had cleared our dishes. Not worth the wait. They were watery and the salt lassi was a sweet lassi which had been oversalted... Oh well.   So service, or maybe the culture of the place, and the fact that it is a hole in the wall, result in 4 stars. But stick with the standards and manage your expectations and it's a great indian meal in Pittsburgh.",

There is Indian music and it's not too loud. So the ambiance is very simple (which is just fine!).  We ordered the Chicken Tikka (spice level 2) and the Chicken Vindaloo (spice level 7) with a side of naan. The wait was pretty quick, 10 or 20 minutes. The service was consistently friendly. And the food was DELICIOUS.  The spice levels were right on and the flavors were fabulous. The portions were fantastic for the price ($9 for what could easily be two meals worth of chicken vindaloo). And oh the fluffy, delicious naan!  At the end of our meal, we were given complimentary masala tea. I don't know if this is standard at all, but it was a nice touch to be sure.  In short, it was worth twice as much as we paid and definitely our new favorite Indian spot.",

My bf hadnt tried biryani before and I thought I would finally check that off the list. I am always hesitant to have him try indian food that i havent made him at home first. But something about this place just told me to try it. SOOO glad i did!  We ordered the chicken malai kabab and the lamb biryani. And we got the biryani at a spice level of 7 which was just right, spicy and flavorful, not just hot for the sake of hot.  There was plenty of meat in the biryani and even if there werent with the chicken we order there was no shortage of protein. The portions were so generous we had more then enough left over to have lunch the next da too. The grand total of the order was $25.66 which is highly reasonable consider it fed the two of us for two meals. And what delicious meals those were!!! If you are looking for seriously yummy indian food go to this tucked away little place ASAP!",

Would be nice to see at least one other type of meat dish, such as lamb or goat. I was also disappointed that they had no type of saag or paneer dish, though they did have a few vegetarian options. But I will try it again to see if they have other options next time. The seating area is quite small so it may be difficult to get a seat in busy times. Also the free tea doesn't apply for weekday lunch apparently but we did try the homemade chai at the end and it was quite good and authentic tasting.",

And the dining room is very tiny, it is not like you can escape it. If people want to watch TV while eating, they order take-out. Isn't this obvious? It is distracting to have a TV playing videos while you come here with someone to enjoy food and conversations. Playing some music on a reasonably low volume for the ambiance? Sure! But loud music videos playing in front of my eyes during my meal? No! It makes the whole dining out experience ruined. I would not return unless they remove their TV and subsequently annoying music videos from their small dining room.",

What drew me in initially was \"15% off dinner for students\"; sounds pretty good for a med student elbow deep with student loan ( I think I also hesitated initially because the prior restaurants  this area did not have best track records...) Anyways, It turns out that I have been missing out BIG time.   When you walk in, expect nothing from decor. This is south Oakland. No finger prints on the cup, and clean utensils, that's all I cared. I was greeted by the owner/server who was very kind and very attentive. He did not speak good English, but who cares when you know he cares. Items on the menu were pretty cheap for dinner (~10). I ordered chicken tikka malsala and fish curry. Both of them were excellent. I am no food critic but I've tried many meh indian food  (including \"Prince of...ehem\") and, there was something about the way they cook their dish that was different. I was very impressed esp with their tikka. Oh, I ordered spicy level 8 for tikka, 7 for fish curry. They were not spicy at all, and I didn't complain. This place has food thats a level above, and not one of your shitty college neighborhood food shacks.   This little joint made me a very happy person tonight. I will be back for lunch buffet or to try different menu for dinner many more times.",

I had the lamb, and it was perfectly cooked in there, not overdone. tikka masala is my usual favorite sauce and this was just as good as normal, but korma was extra special. I ordered the shrimp and they were nice sized shrimp. I preferred the garlic naan to the regular. baingan bharta (eggplant with tomatoes) usually has more tomato flavor, but theirs in more eggplant strong and it was creamed like a paste. my personal preference is more tomato flavor and a little more recognizable.",

It's only been four days since opening and the staff is super friendly.  I'm unsure if it's always going to have a lunch buffet (or Lanuch Buffet as the sign outside proudly advertises) or if it's only to celebrate their grand opening but everything was delicious.  Nothing was labeled but I recognized Palaak Paneer, Chana Masala, Chicken Tikka Masala, Goat Curry, Vegetable Pakora, and Samosas.  There were also a few things I didn't recognize.  The buffet didn't have any Naan but that was because the waiter brought it to our table, fresh from the oven. They also gave us free Mango Lassis to celebrate their grand opening.  So all in all I have to say the quality was better than both Prince of India and the now defunct India Garden, it's also cheaper than both, and the staff is a lot more friendly.",

Everything that we ordered was cooked to perfection!  We started off with the chicken samosa and the garlic shrimp and they were both delicious.  We ordered the special bread basket which is a combination of three breads. All three of them were great; however, we particularly enjoyed the garlic naan. I ordered the shrimp tikka masala with a spice level of 3 and thought is was delicious, my husband ordered the lamb kadahai with a spice level of 4 and also loved it.  Our friends were also pleased with their choices. After dinner we shared the rice adding and the gulab jaman.  It was a perfect ending to a fabulous meal.  The biggest complement came from my husband who has been to India several times.  He said it was the most authentic Indian food he has experienced outside of India.",

The place used to be a Burmese restaurant, but now remodeled completely. I wasn't really impressed by the decor though. They could've done more to embrace the Bangladeshi theme of the restaurant. The crystal chandeliers are pretty, but kind of out of place. Overall, the restaurant is well lit and clean. The service was phenomenal and the waiter even brought a basket of fresh naan to our table.  I really enjoyed the food! Unlike the Indian food I had before at other restaurants in Oakland, the flavors at Bangal Kabab is very crisp and defined. Each dish has a unique taste with great attention to details. The spiciness level is very low and tolerable so don't fear. There are a few vegetarian options at the buffet, but not enough. If you're a vegetarian, I recommend ordering vegetarian dishes straight from the menu instead of going to the buffet.  Overall, my experience at Bangal Kabab was great. Only $7 for all you can eat lunch! Can't beat that! I highly recommend this place if you're in the area. I will definitely return again in the near future!",

Also, you can get your unlimited naan fix here.  - Not much to expect in the way of service... + ... but they're good at keeping your water glasses full, haha. I guess that's what's important here.  I think before when it was a newer buffet and a little cheaper, the limited variety seemed more reasonable. Even having only gone a handful of times, it feels repetitive. Still, it's a consistent option if you know that you want to eat a lot of Indian food to fill up! If I return, I'll give ordering off their menu a try.

So I called them and asked for delivery but they told me it's not available. What?? First I thought it was because it's too cold, but NO!!! The driver wasn't available. What?? But both our minds and tummies were so ready for Indian food, we just couldn't forget about it. So guess what? We walked 10 minutes in 9F weather. We're glad we did it!! The food was so warm and good - it made our body so warm from the inside out. Warm lentil soup, curry, chick peas...it was so good!! It was worth the walk in the cold weather! The flavor from Indian spice was perfect.",

    "text": "I have only ever been here for the lunch buffet, but I have out of the five other lunch buffets I have tried so far in Pittsburgh, this one is by far my favorite. I can't say much for the off-menu items, but as long as the buffet keeps putting out a tasty selection, that's what I'll be returning for, because it's hard to pick just one main dish!  The buffet always has naan, plain basmati rice, some kind of biryani, veggie pakoras, and tandoori chicken.  There is almost always chicken tikka masala, and chana masala (chickpeas). The rest of the selection changes a bit week by week...usually there is some kind of lentil dish and some kind of potato dish present, and then one more type of chicken. It's not the biggest selection, but I am usually a fan of every dish, so that's fine with me. The flavors of each dish tend to be quite strong, which I love, as many buffets seem to skimp on or water down the flavor of buffet items.  Nothing is every really that spicy, but that's how buffets usually are.  The ambiance is cozy - I don't know for sure, but it seems like it's just a family running the restaurant. The front door looks like the front door of my mom's house, and the inside has maybe 9-10 tables seating 2 or 4.  There is always just one waiter, and he keeps our water glasses full and clears plates as needed, so no complaints there. Sometimes there are Bollywood videos running on the TV at the front of the restaurant. I tend to enjoy them.  The dessert selection is meh for the buffet, but my obsession with Indian food is directed at curry, so that doesn't make a difference for me.",

From their wonderful buffet to their food off the menu, this is as close to my mama's food as I will ever get in Pittsburgh.  The buffet contains your typical Indian fare, from Tandoori chicken to vegetable korma. Whenever my parents come to visit, I always bring them here and the owners of the restaurant treat them like royalty. We all converse in Bangla, discussing everything from politics to Bollywood music. My mom was so comfortable that she went back to kitchen to talk to the cooks about cooking techniques!   As for the food off the menu, I once ordered the Fish Curry and it was SLAMMIN'. Perfectly spicy and most importantly, tasted like home. No fishy taste at all.   Decor could be less cheesy, I think. I wish they would put more items that embraced Bangladeshi culture, but that is a small price to pay for excellent service and great food.   Bottom line: I've always had a great time here, whether I'm eating their buffet or food of their menu. I highly recommend this spot if you want to try some authentic Bangladeshi cuisine!",

My husband and I came here for their lunch buffet, which they offer daily for $9.99. Their buffet doesn't have a huge selection, but it was enough for us. We wanted to get a taste of varying dishes since we're not entirely too familiar with Indian cuisine. The selections had chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani, tandoori chicken, fish curry, mixed vegetables, of course naan and rice, and possibly a few other dishes I might be missing. I was very pleased with the taste of all the dishes. The chicken and fish dishes were not at all dry like we expected of buffet food. They were perfectly moist and the spice was mild. With an affordable price tag and good quality buffet food, we will definitely be back for our next Indian fix!",

This would have been okay, sometimes take out gets the food sitting around all day. But what irked me was that the poori was not a poori! It was an oily, gross, and most importantly - a FLAT - roti. A poori, by definition, puffs. It is puffed bread. When I called the restaurant about this, the person who picked up tried to mansplain to me what a poori is. Sorry, I guess in my 30 years of life, I've been eating pooris wrong the whole time; my mother, my grandmother, and every other Bengali person I know with whom I've had pooris are also wrong- I will be sure to let them know they've been eating the wrong thing their lives too and calling it a poori mistakenly.   Now, the fish curry, it's $10, that's fine, but giving me only HALF a piece of fish for $10 is NOT fine. In fact, it is highway robbery.   Needless to say, I will not be coming back here.",

I have a well developed pallet for Indian/Pakistani and all the food surrounding countries of this sort as my girlfriend is Pakistani and I have been trying authentic food for the last year or so.   Bengal Kebab was a decent experience i came alone for the buffet which was $10, the selection was not massive and the experience was not 5 star but this Bangladeshi restaurant was a good 3.5 stars - I will round up to be kind. They had an array of masalas and curries with a salad bar. I would give it a B for cleanliness and decor and a B+ for service as the guy running the restaurant always made sure I stayed full on water.   I didnt think to much of the dishes with chicken or the plain vegetable curries- there was one curry that really danced well with my taste buds it was the Moat Curry or something like that, it consisted of curry, sweet peas, and cubes of cheese (paneer) i believe. It was very good. I would imagine the dishes you get here when the lunch buffet is not active are much tastier.   It is halal if you are a abiding muslim, and it tastes pretty good.   I would return.",

He greeted us with no uniform and wearing sandals, and then pointed to the table he wanted us to be seated, not very professional. Next he took our order mind you wearing sandals and a toothpick in his mouth. The food was edible but as all the yelpers are pointing out its extraordinary and worthy of 5 stars, Far From It!!! Bland and boring Indian food at best. I am guessing yelpers feel pity for this restaurant and the price is reasonable that is what people prefer. I however like to pay good money for good  authentic Indian food.",

However, my second visit here a few days ago wasn't as good as my first. This time, I came in with a friend for their lunch buffet. We walked in and stood there for 2-3 minutes because the only guy working was on the phone. We made awkward eye contact, but he didn't motion us to sit down or anything. Eventually, we just sat down. When he came over to pour us water, he didn't really speak to us. The food at the buffet was fine, except for the rice, which was dry and hardened and had clearly been left out for hours.  The interior is interesting. Most of it looks like a typical Indian restaurant: lots of colors (especially reds and oranges) and a TV screen playing a Bollywood film. The chandelier in the center of the restaurant is what threw me off. It is bright and gorgeous, giving the place a more lavish feel, but didn't really match the rest of the restaurant.   I think you're better off ordering from the menu here instead of doing the buffet. Their lunch buffet doesn't really stand out from other Indian lunch buffets in Oakland and service could be a lot better.   Taste | 3.5 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 2 OVERALL | 3",

The samosas were too oily, the chicken tikka  masala was not very flavorful. We decided to not go there again...  Original review: What a nice hole in the wall kind of Indian restaurant! Cheap, efficient and most importantly delicious! We have already been there twice in the past few weeks. The food is tasty and affordable. The samosas seemed to have been freshly made, and they tasted gorgeous! We tried the chicken curry, which was basically a simple chicken gravy, but was flavorful. The chicken makhani was excellent! Reminded me of dhaba style restaurants back home in India! The Biryani was delicious too, and oh, the nan is amazing! We are definitely going back there to try other dishes on the menu, and check out their desserts.",

As other reviews have pointed out, each dish has a very distinct delightful flavor and is very light in comparison to other curries from other Indian places. Perhaps it's a representation of a different region, one which does not use an abundance of ghee?  Parking is a pain but I don't feel like I can take away points for something beyond the restaurants control.  One of the things which stood out so favorably in my mind of this place is the young gentleman who was our server... He was attentive and provided one of the best dining experiences with his kindness and eagerness to make it a good dining experience for everyone there. He made me feel like I was a visitor in his home and he wanted to be the most hospitable and gracious host.  The tea in the end was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal.",

Pretty extensive menu and ugh their chicken tikka and makhani is sooo good! They give you a huge container of mango lassi if you order it to go! Either way, good portion. Quality was always good here and quick service! Only down point was that I didn't discover this place earlier!",

Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Madras, Goat Saag -- all very good (but don't believe the claim that the goat dish will be boneless meat).  We got take out, so hard to comment on the wait staff beyond this: they were very conscientious about asking about the spice level of the dishes, but otherwise they were a little puzzled-seeming, like they had ended up in this restaurant by accident.  Anyway, I would happily eat here again.  Recommended.",

My friends ordered paneer and chicken tikka masala. Those tasted great too.   Overall a great cozy place for a quiet dinner. Biriyani is a must try.

    "text": "I visited with CM for lunch a week ago at 12:30.  I'm not a huge fan of buffets in general, but the positive reviews and word on the street convinced me to give this place a try.  CM was game, so we met there to enjoy some quality Indian cuisine.  As a regular at Prince of India, CM was impressed with the range of options available on the buffet, which put theirs to shame.  I was as well, with the caveat that, as Lauren B. mentioned, all the meat items were chicken-based.  While this wasn't too much of an issue for me, since I'm picky when it comes to meat, I can see how lovers of lamb and goat might find it off-putting, and even I would have appreciated the ability to try the fish curries that other reviewers speak highly of.  For a buffet, we felt that the quality of the food items was good, though nothing in particular stood out.  The only item I found lacking was the rice pudding like dish--but then again, I'm not a huge fan of rice pudding, anyway.  The price for the weekday lunch buffet is now $10--not $8, as it used to be.  As others have mentioned, the seating area is on the smaller side. It wasn't busy when we visited, however--perhaps because the word hasn't spread about this place yet?  At any rate, we were pleased with our experience here, and would return the next time we're hungry for Indian food at lunch.",

    "text": "I was in the area for a quick visit and wanted to see what the area had to offer in the way of Indian food and this restaurant did NOT disappoint!  Nestled just a few blocks off the Univ. of Pittsburgh's campus, this restaurant sits on a quiet, residential street. A bright red awning made it clear I had arrived.  When I first walked in around 7:00 on a Tuesday, I quickly made 2 observations: I was the only patron and it was small inside. I didn't let that phase me as I quickly grabbed a seat at a small 2-person table and ordered a mango lassi. There was a large TV showing a Bollywood movie on the front wall. The other walls were brightly painted and had few pictures.  My bright orange lassi was as expected: cold and full of flavor. I ordered the two-piece chicken samosa which came out golden brown and piping hot after 5-7 minutes. I used the three dipping sauces provided to add a little spice or sweetness. I never ordered samosa's before but they were tasty and were a great precursor to the rest of my meal.  For the main course, I settled on lamb vindaloo ordered with an average spice and a side order of naan. By this time, 2 families totaling about 8 people trickled in and took up half the seating by the front window. A single man who brought a bottle of wine sat near me in a booth.  My lamb vindaloo came out looking delicious and I could smell the aromatic flavors synonymous with Indian food. Basmati rice also came with the vindaloo. I had to remind my server of my naan order which he quickly brought out. It was hot and had several dribbles of butter on it.  I don't claim to be a connoisseur of Indian food but I have been to India before and been to 10-12 different Indian restaurants around the country so I have an idea of what to expect. Bengal Kabob House was second to none. The lamb and potatoes were tender to cut and the vindaloo flavors blended together amazingly well which left no doubt the food was authentic. Each bite went down easy and the spice and portion size was just right. I enjoyed a second mango lassi with my vindaloo. Throughout the night, the server was attentive but by no means overbearing.   The prices were very reasonable and they didn't charge me for my second mango lassi although I mentioned it was not on my bill. Very classy!  Overall, I had a great experience. I went with the expectation of eating a good Indian meal and walked away feeling completely satisfied. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants an authentic Indian meal at prices even college students can afford!",

    "text": "Certainly a fan of Bangal Kabab! My girlfriend and I have been to Bangal Kabab House once before our most recent trip this past weekend. We most definitely enjoyed ourself and the food was some of the best Indian food I've ever had. This time around her little brother wanted to experience the wonderful Indian grub, for the first time! So we looked no other than Bangal down in Oakland!  This time around I stayed True to my roots, I'm a sucker when it comes to   some lamb. Last visit, I got the lamb shank which was this huge slab of lamb on the bone. So tender and juicy, the meat was just shredding off the bone. Delicious! I ended up trying out the Lamb Kadahai. What a solid choice! The lamb was pulled from the bone this time and served in a spicy onion gravy. My goodness! Again, the lamb was wonderfully cooked, it was as smooth as butter to cut into. The gravy, even though not really spicy, was thick and onion really allowed those spices to pop!   My girlfriend with the chicken masala which she also amazing. I know because I tried a helping myself (what BF doesn't try their lady's food). And her brother went with the chicken korma. Being his first time trying Indian, the way he lapped up that meal, he must of really enjoyed it!   For me what makes Bangal Kabab House so good, our the prices for the amount of food you get. We ordered 3 entrees, 2 baskets of garlic naan and a side of meat samsosas. We got all that for 45 bucks after our 20% off Yelp coupon! This is place is great, and if you like Indian food, or if you want to try it out and see if you do, Bangal Kabab is the place to go!",

The samosa is maybe my most favorite samosa ever with the traditional powder you would find on a samosa in India. That being said, it's pretty spicy and I love and can tolerate very spicy food. I love their vegetable biryani, though I'm sure it's not as healthy as it sounds. Their chicken seems to vary. I'm not sure if it's the time of day, the chef, or what they have in stock but I almost always get the chicken vindaloo and it's been slightly different several times (sometimes it's chicken thighs, sometimes cubes, sometimes a totally differ color or consistency). It's never been bad, just inconsistent.  Parking is limited on the street and pro tip: do not park in or even slightly in the handicapped spot on the opposite side of the street. The man who lives in the house has and will call to get you towed! I would never, but I saw some guy park inches over the line and the man was out there on the phone reading the license plate to someone.",

    "text": "After weeks of telling my boyfriend I was craving Indian food, we finally visited Bangal Kabab. A friend of mine used to live in Oakland and we went here a couple times before, but it's been a while and I was excited to come back.  If you're dining in, you receive an order of complimentary papad with 3 sauces. Papad is a thin, crispy almost chip-like food that you can use for dipping or eat by itself. We also started with an order of the garlic cheese naan, which I definitely have fond memories of from visits past. Their naan is always perfectly crispy, slightly charred just the way I like it, and tastes great.  One of the first times I came here, I remember ordering the mango chicken and it being amazing. The mango chicken is in a curry-type sauce and is served with rice. It's not overly sweet, and you can definitely taste the mango in the sauce. Curry spice is a strong flavor, and sometimes it can be overpowering, but Bangal Kabab does an excellent job at seasoning just right. I decided on an order of mango chicken, my boyfriend got the lamb shank, and we got an order of bhindi masala. Okra is one of my favorite vegetables and it's not the easiest to find up north, so when I saw the bhindi masala which (lightly-fried okra with tomatoes and onions in sauce) I had to go for it.  In total, our meal was a dollar or two over $40 for a ton of food and plenty of leftovers. We nearly 2 to-go boxes packed all the way full with leftovers for the next couple days! There was a 20% off special on Yelp, so always check for specials before paying. You never know! We loved all of our food, and we'll certainly be back. Bangal Kabab has been a high-quality spot as long as I've been going there, and I'd recommend it to anyone with the taste for good, authentic Indian food.",

I ordered for takeout over the phone, no hassles, and picked up my food, no hassles.  Vegetarian samosas: delicately fried with a fairly flaky exterior and absolutely delicious interior! I really enjoyed the balance of potato, peas, etc. that was fluffy on the palate. I feel that the exterior could have been crispier, but honestly was a solid samosa.  Chicken tikka masala: a bit sweeter than what I'm familiar with. I appreciated the strong tomato flavor as well as a kind of smokey caramelized sugar possibly as a result of a sweeter base. One other thing I really enjoyed was that the chicken was very tender and very tasty! The one criticism is that the dish was overall a bit saltier than I preferred.  Overall a very good Indian meal!",

I was deceived by the sign outside because it says student discount of 15% but when I went to pay for the buffet they said the 15% off doesn't apply to the buffet. The food was very good however we only got water in the beginning and end of our meals (which isn't a lot considering the food can be salty/spicy at times) so it would've been nice if we had some more water throughout our meal. Also, there was only one waitress the entire time and there is a minimum of $10 when paying with credit card (which is hard when you're just going for lunch!)",

It was good and flavorful, but not a 5 on the spicy scale like we asked for. I never really know how scale the food, especially with Indian, clearly I was very off.   I felt uncomfortable the whole time as if we were inconveniencing them despite being the only people in the restaurant.

The only good dish was the pakora. At $10, this was not particularly cheap or good compared to other Indian buffets like on N. Craig St. or Coriander's in Sq. Hill.

We watched him bring some cardomom to the couple across from us, and give them instructions on how to make their own tea at home.  My son had a sheek kabob, I had lamb paneer. Yum! My son was new to Indian food and started the meal with a little reluctance, but ended the meal stuffed and very happy. I got to try some of his kabab, which was very well prepared. Both entrees were fresh and flavorful and you could tell not over processed into nothingness. My spinach dish was fresh as it still had that bright green color which had not faded into an olive drab. It was great.  Total damage for 2 entrees, rice, 2 orders of naan, a mango lassi, and diet soda?   $30, and well worth it.",

However, the staff was extremely courteous, and my food was ready when I arrived.  Upon opening the food when I got home, the food looked okay, nothing extraordinary. I ordered vegetable samosas and chicken tikka masala. The masala looked a little greasy. However, once I tasted the food, my skepticism vanished. The samosas were probably the best I have ever had, and the chicken tikka masala, although slightly different from other tikka masalas I have had, was extremely flavorful and delicious.

    "text": "We visited Bangal Kabab house on a Friday afternoon for the lunch buffet.  It was nearly empty inside, however we were treated very poorly by the one member of the staff we had any contact with.  The host barely spoke to us and when he did he was quite surly.   At one point, because there was a large floor fan blowing directly on our booth, my paper napkin blew off my lap. The host came by and picked it up OFF THE FLOOR, refolded it and placed it back on our table, securing it with my bowl of gulab jamun. Unacceptable.  The food on the lunch buffet was OK, nothing to write home about, but the service was the worst I've ever experienced at a buffet. We felt decidedly unwelcome and will not return.",

    "text": "Edit 4/18/2015: I did not know there was a minimum charge of $10. In the future, I will be sure to return with a friend!  PRICES HAVE CHANGED. At least they must have, because I was charged $10.69 for the weekday lunch buffet even though the sign on their window still advertises $7.99. (This is more than All India's weekend lunch buffet, even without the student discount). I am still a bit put off about the fairly large difference, but I am not factoring it into the rating. Though it came as a surprise, the price was fair, though I won't be returning unless it's for a special occasion.  I walked in around 1:00 pm, and the restaurant was empty. (A couple more parties of one or two had come in by the time I left.) It's pretty small, and the decor places it somewhere a little above hole-in-the-wall. The waitress was very attentive in a quiet way, but I didn't feel any of the hospitality mentioned in the other reviews. The hot buffet had pakoras, rice, naan, chicken tandoori, chicken biryani, and six other entrees, three of which were vegetarian, including chicken or vegetables curry, mataar paneer, and chicken or vegetable tikki masala. The cold food was housed in large coolers whose lids were closed when I went, and included watermelon, oranges, rice pudding, a round sweet that tasted vaguely like carrot cake (but wetter), salad, and chutney. I also noticed a container labeled \"tea\" by the register when I paid; I'm not sure if it's part of the buffet (I didn't bother to ask).  Unlike other buffets I've tried, the food (especially the vegetable curry) is spicy--almost at the edge of my tolerance (which is embarrassingly low). I was okay with some water, though. Though the place was empty when I started eating, the food tasted fresh and warm. Everything was delicious, and there were a couple dishes (such as the biryani and tikki masala) that I took a bite of and thought, \"So this is what they taste like\"--as in, previous experiences with those dishes must have involved blander versions. I was worried about the naan since it had been sitting out, but it was still soft, if not fresh-from-the-oven warm. The fruit was sweet (and the watermelon was a nice sight after a long winter) and the salad was fresh. The rice pudding wasn't my favorite; it was on the thinner side and tasted a little like bananas, for some reason.   Side note: the bathroom is freezing cold.  Overall, I enjoyed the food. If they still charged $7.99, I'd be back without a doubt. Since I paid $10.69, though, I'll probably be going to All India on North Craig Street when I'm in the mood for an Indian buffet, not because this place isn't worth the price, but because All India is cheaper for comparable quality and variety.",

    "text": "Do not order online! Excited by the reviews here, I placed an order on EatStreet. I arrived at the restaurant about 35 minutes after placing the order (the system quoted a 20min prep time). However, when I got there they did not recognize my name and tried to take a new order down. I finally noticed a ticket on the counter with my phone number on it, so I pointed to it. They then told me \"20 minutes\" and walked away. They had not even sent the order to the kitchen to be prepared! When I complained, they pointed to the fax machine and told me it was broken, and that they aren't taking online orders. Even so, their website and accounts are still active. A full hour after leaving work I got home with my food. I'd hate to see what happens with phone orders given how difficult it was to communicate when in person.  The food was actually pretty good, though that might have been influenced by my hunger after waiting so long. The biryani was definitely more Bangladeshi, which was really nice to have. I enjoyed the curry I ordered, though it was a bit thinner than I am used to. I would usually be happy to go back based on the food and prices. However, thanks to the abysmal customer service I won't be going back any time soon.",

One caveat: I've only been for dinner; most of the complaining reviews seem to be about the lunch buffet.  The plus is that the food is delicious. A few of my friends who generally refuse to eat Indian food will eat here. The Indians I know, who are really not pushovers when it comes to food, love it. I'd recommend the biryanis, and I really like the bhindi masala. Curries are also good.  The minuses are what you expect from a place like this, so they really don't count.  Look, you're not going to take Ban Ki Moon here or have your wedding reception here.  -Hole in a wall decor -Service is fine, but not amazing",

I thought the food was very good. The items on the menu were all typical dishes from an Indian (Punjabi) buffet and I did not find anything that was specially Bangladeshi. I suppose this might be on the regular menu. Nevertheless I liked the quality, and it's definitely the best Indian buffet I have had in Pittsburgh. The staff is very courteous. I incorrectly assumed the masala tea at the register might be part of the meal, but they let me take a cup on exiting. I would visit again.",

    "text": "This place was SO SO SO SO good. My boyfriend and I came here because we wanted something cheap but good and this place sounded perfect. We got both the veggie and the chicken samosas- they were crispy and flaky and really flavorful. We also got a chick pea based appetizer ( can't remember the name, sorry...) and our (super sweet, super nice, lovely smile) waiter asked us how spicy we wanted it from 1-10. He asked that question for every dish, whixh was smart because my boyfriend can't do spicy food. We weren't too hungry so we debated if we should get entrees, but we decided to share a chicken tikka masala and some garlic naan. Their garlic naan melts in your mouth when you bite into it, and the chicken tikka masala was perfectly seasoned. It came with about two cups of steamed rice. We also both got mango lassis which were creamy and delicious, and at the end our waiter brought us two cups of complimentary masala tea. It was a perfect ending to a seriously perfect meal. I didn't even ask for honey or brown sugar instead of the white sugar, like I usually do, because our waiter was so kind that I didn't want to bother him. After our 10% student discount, all this food came up to a mere 27 dollars.   TL;DR   Please support this restaurant! They opened three months ago, have DELICIOUS food, are very cheap, and are super friendly.",

While I'll always miss the previous restaurant here (Burma Tokyo), the new owners did a nice job of renovating and sprucing the place up. Service was polite and friendly, and the buffet was set up nicely. There were not too many options, but it was enough variety to make the lunch worth it. Most items were okay, although there wasn't much chicken left in the curry. The goat was probably the best, and we finished with some sweet rice pudding. This place will probably have potential if they keep up the good service and food quality.",

I would have rated it 5 stars then, all the way up until this summer which was the last time I went before today.  Today was a completely different experience.  The new staff was not friendly, but worst of all, they are serving VERY SMALL PORTIONS NOW.  The fish pakora portion was tiny.  Channa Chat in 2 to-go containers -- smaller containers and they were only half filled.  i told my friend about it and she said the Mali kofta she got this weekend was worse- 3 tiny bite sized pieces floating in 12 oz of sauce/gravy.  Everything still tastes authentic, just like Bangla cuisine. Slightly different recipes than before.. But unless they start giving people the portions they are paying for, they will not last long as a business.",

I've been to this small and minimalistic place for lunch/dinner so many times that the server knows me now. Very welcoming service and fresh, palatable food. They start off by serving crispy papad (gram flour dough made thin and roasted in dry heat) which is a rarity in Indian restaurants. I love their goat biriyani which boasts of succulent bite-size meat pieces, aromatic spices, and garnishing of fried onions, almonds and raisins to die for! Their sizzling kababs are again a smooth blend of juicy chicken or meat with appropriate flavors in your mouth. My vegetarian friends have loved this place too. Their paneer and vegetable dishes give you decent number of options to choose from but definitely each one worth trying. Finally, you will want to end on a sweet note with their delicious rasmalai. Also, worth mentioning is their mango lassi. I've been coming to this place every time I visit the city even after moving out of Pittsburgh.",
