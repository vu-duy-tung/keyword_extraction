    "text": "AWFUL!  The hub bub about the decor, well, it's cheap and trashy. The place REEKS of stale cigarette smoke (and this is coming from a smoker) that hits you like a ton of bricks the moment you walk in the door.  On a whim, we decided to try Bob's Garage for the first time on Saturday, July 13, 2013. The place was all but empty and no one greeted us or told us where to sit, we just kind of stood by the door waiting to get noticed before finally choosing a table on our own. No verbal greeting or acknowledgment of any kind as we stood there. Ordered a glass of wine and beers for my companions. I suddenly felt ill (didn't know at the time, but it was a sudden attack of vertigo), alas, I digress. I felt as if I were going to pass out. Sent one of my companions to get me some water. The waitress came over and said \"Oh, I would have gotten that for you\" in a very snotty tone, as if we breached some etiquette by NOT asking her for it when she was clearly not attentive. We ordered cheese sticks in case it was low blood sugar, but it was not. They were frozen and certainly not worth the price. The waitress could tell I was having some sort of issue and brought our check over \"in case you need to leave suddenly\"...REALLY? She never asked if I was okay, needed her to call someone, needed help or anything, but was more worried about collecting the bill than a customer's well-being. I will NEVER go back there again. Oh, by the way, 2 draught beers, 1 glass of wine (that I did not even sip) and an order of cheese sticks (frozen and not very good) was almost $22, what a rip off!",

They actually close down for 4 days to put up the decorations in here, and it shows.  When you enter you come into a bar area with seating all around a rectangular bar - this bar still allows smoking.  There is also a side room (similar to a glassed in porch) where it is non-smoking and they serve food.  Beer fans beware as they have a wide selection of American let downs (see: Miller Lite), but you can get away with the Yuengling on tap.  I got a burger and fries which was large, round, pinkish, and not at all juicy, but still pretty tasty, and very cheap (I think $4.50) and the fries were not bad, and also cheap (maybe $1.50).  We had a good waitress and although we sat in the 'non-smoking' area I still felt a little bit like I left a smoky bar when I got home.",

It looked questionable to say the least but when we called them they said karaoke was a go - so we thought we'd give it a shot!  When we walked in it was hard not to be overwhelmed by the overly tacky decorations and the cigarette smoke.  We also noticed that the average age of the bar was 65/70.  We certainly had our reservations about staying (especially after hearing nothing but 50's songs) but decided we'd sit back, have fun, and shake the joint up a bit!  I sang \"Shoop\" by Salt n' Pepa and although half of the full bar was wondering why the heck we would sing something like that we also got a few dancers.  We ended up staying until closing - we had a great time - but I'm not sure I'll be back.  I hate leaving a place and wreaking of smoke, the bar tenders didn't seem super stoked to have us (they didn't seem super stoked to be there in general), and there are all around better places nearby.",

    "text": "I've only been here once, but it was on December 23, which is about the equivalent of strolling into Mecca during the Hajj. In wintertime, Bob's Garage becomes a local destination because the two-room building gets completely overloaded with holiday decorations. The effort apparently takes two full Sundays and about 250 man hours. It doesn't get pulled down until the first Sunday after Valentine's Day, which is about how long it takes for the holiday hangover to pass.  Three phrases you won't hear inside:  - \"I come for the food.\" - \"The air in here is just so fresh!\" - \"Don't put that decoration up. It's too tacky, and we don't have any more room.\"  What makes it all especially nice is that it's all part of a massive December fundraising effort on the part of the Spirit of Christmas charity which aims to buy toys, clothes and food for needy North Hills families. As if the lights aren't enough to dull the senses, we experienced an overpacked bar and bad karaoke (redundant, I know) that evening. Lots of shouting about raffle tickets and door prizes. A talking Santa train overhead. Not exactly a place to sit and have a normal conversation, but that can be foregone in favor of the joyful cacophonous maelstrom of holiday revelry.",

We sat at the cramped bar in awe with giddy smiles on our faces for most of the night. Just try to avoid Nick at Night - he'll try to take you to Vegas and marry you the same night, or pawn you off to his undertaker friend. Aside from some creepy lovebirds, it's cheap, everyone is extra friendly and there were even a bunch of Christmas tunes thrown in to the karaoke.  Everyone should go here at least once.

Ahhh, Freeport Road...Not the easiest to get in and out of, especially if you are departing on 28!  As reported in other posts, you can still smoke in here.  They do have a non-smoking room but it still smells like smoke and was 80 degrees.  Food.  This is an after thought!  My friend and I both ordered burgers...got our orders wrong, reversed them as well.  Greasy.  Tabs...got our tabs cashed out early and the next waitress had the couldn't be bothered approach.    Beer...Mostly domestic on tap.  Reasonable price.    Lights...Christmas lights are the staple here.  Griswold style is up until early February do you have time to enjoy!  To make a long story short, this is a dive bar that found its niche with the Christmas lights.  Past that, lots of locals and not a lot of reason to stop.  Eight years since my first visit, and I'm good for another eight!",

The sensory overload on the decorations within the bar is very amusing similar to the feeling you have when you are looking at a house decorated with 10,000 Christmas lights.     Some of the pictures on Yelp do not do the place justice.  This particular night was our third stop and it was Karaoke Night.    The place had a great vibe.

I reeked of smoke and didn't appreciate that part since I'm a non smoker. People crowded in and we had a very nice waitress who was left alone to basically tend to the whole bar. She was kind despite being stressed out. I didn't have any expectations but I really enjoyed the karaoke. I ordered a beer, a bologna sandwich with onion rings, which were good. So then I reeked of smoke AND onions. I went with the flow and would go there again with a group.

When I say decked out beyond belief, I seriously mean just that. Ya' won't believe it. The bartender's are always nice and actually know how to make drinks. The bar itself is cool; its a rectangular shape  so everybody is facing one another. The food is very top notch although regular bar fair. The only knock I've got on the place is that it gets a little too smokey for my taste and they sometimes have karaoke, which I'm not always in the mood to hear.

We asked why it was 1:30 and the bartender was just blatantly rude and said \"I'm done for tonight.\" Also the karaoke DJ tonight had very weird versions of songs and showed favoritism to a strange couple that weren't awesome singers.  I'm a long time patron here and I've never been so rudely treated by a bartender here. I feel bad giving this 1 star, but wow that was rude.   --my point being that the typical Bob's garage staff would NEVER",

It was so busy but we managed to get a table on the patio and we all ordered food and it came out really fast for how busy it was. The waitresses were great especially dealing with carrying trays and drinks through the crowd of drunk people. I just ordered the pretzels and cheese they were good and I had some of the spinach dip with the homemade chips it was also delicious. We didn't stay long since it was far from my apartment and we couldn't drink too much but I definitely want to come back it was really fun and definitely felt like you were in some cheesy Christmas movie.",

Needless to say, this makes for a very unique dining/drinking experience! The inside is quite small with just the bar area, a tiny corner for the bathrooms next to the kitchen, and a back room that is a little smaller than the bar.   The menu sounds better than the food actually is. I ordered the hot turkey and french fry sandwich and it was very underwhelming. Mostly bread, fries, and gravy with almost no turkey. I would probably try to avoid ordering food here again.  What makes this average out to a 3 star is the atmosphere. Such a different dive bar, and the night we visited was karaoke night. Such a fun atmosphere with drink prices that were OK for a weekend night out. The group of us had a blast with karaoke and would definitely be up for coming back. Our waitress was very attentive and took care of us all night even though we were migrating around the room for karaoke.   If you like karaoke definitely try this place out. Would not recommend eating here. Would recommend drinking here.",

I'll start by saying we did have a pretty good time over all but the reason for the 2 star rating is that the one bartender, an older bald headed man was completely rude and homophobic.  During karaoke he would yell from behind the bar to shut the F* up.  ummm its karaoke night.. .you're going to have drunk people up there singing... it wasn't just us... everyone was having a great time!   He had 2 friends that I think were co workers (one was the bouncer) sitting at the corner of the bar that he would go whisper to and they would all look over at us and laugh.  It made us very uncomfortable but we chose to stay because we were having fun singing and we made friends with a lot of people in the bar.   He also would not serve us... When we went up to the bar he would look at us and walk away and we would have to wait on the friendly blonde bartender to come serve us.  When Karaoke ended at 1:30 he just went over and flipped the power off and said Time to get out, go home, no more singing.  The DJ explained to us that hes an ass and not normally there on Wednesdays and that we should come back again because we are fun.  He was also doing so many shots behind the bar i'm not sure if he is really that rude or if he was just drunk but I feel like if he is like this all the time time then his time in the service industry should come to an end. There are gay people every where and the bar was filled with them.. not just us and You should never be made to feel uncomfortable in an establishment that you are paying money at so get over it.  The blonde bartender, the woman in the leopard shirt, the young bus boy, the guy in the black polo that was running everywhere and the DJ were all great and like I said we had a fun time even facing the homophobic bouncer and bartender and we could have left at any point but we shouldn't be made to feel we have to leave.  We were paying money just like everyone else!!!   Everyone should go and check out the place but if you see an old bald headed man behind the bar don't be too gay or sing karaoke and you'll be fine !!!!!!!",

The Waitresses were all friendly and helpful even when they were very busy. The night before Thanksgiving is always a crazy bar night and I'm sure most bartenders and waitresses hate it but nonetheless the female bartender and waitresses were wonderful. The older bald gentlemen bartender although is a different story. Through the night watching him take shots behind the bar is all fine and cool but clearly he forgot where he works ....ya know ....at a karaoke bar. His constant shouting of obscenities after every song sung by patrons at the bar started to get really old halfway through the night. Hearing him shout shut the f*** up, sit down, oh my God shut the f*** up to me was at least disconcerting considering the fact that although he may be a 150 years old he does work at a KAROKEE bar. I know many other people heard his repetitive offensive remarks and it continued until the end of the night where he shut off the power to the DJ's karaoke computer mid song when a couple were singing. I spoke to the DJ about this bartender and his comments, and he assured me he's not usually there Wednesdays, and he also told me that with him shutting off the power at his booth it messed up his programming and hard drive on his computer for the karaoke. And for clarification purposes no, I'm not some bitter tone-deaf person who is just upset at some idiot bartenders remarks. I'm simply someone who was there having fun with a bunch of my friends and couldn't help but notice his derogatory comments towards everyone. So in conclusion I guess I would say to that indeed HE should be the one that should shut the f*** up, because other than him this place is an absolute blast!",

But if you're hungry or thirsty, you'll overcome any initial reservation you might have just developed. Once inside your visual senses are overwhelmed by what appears to have been an explosion of confetti and Christmas decorations that magically seem to be suspended from the ceiling like psychedelic stalactites. Once you accept that you're in an alternate universe, you can mosey up to the bar or find a seat at one of the small tables. I chose the former and noted the abundance of ash trays scattered all over the bar. Since I'm not a fan of eating where there is a heavy layer of cigarette smoke, I nearly got up and walked out. Luckily, no one at that particular moment was firing one up so I stayed.   I needed a beer (one of those days at work where I felt I owed it to myself to just have one...) but alas, the tap selection consisted of two lite beers (never!) and two summer ales (blue moon and summer shanty - neither of which will ever pass my lips). So I figured it was gonna be one of those days from start to finish and just ordered water.   Perusing the menu left me feeling like this wasn't my day at all so I opted instead for a burger. While it was ok, it wasn't great. Maybe I was so distracted by all the crap hanging over my head and worried for my personal safety that I couldn't properly focus on my meal. Service was good and friendly but the atmosphere and I don't match. And, for that matter,  equivalent bar food can be found at your neighborhood tavern and you won't have to have your senses assaulted. I won't be back.",
