Than we ordered our food and instead of potato pancakes she brought hash browns, which were over salted and terrible. Then we got pie and we were on our second bite, and a very long hair was baked into the filling, barf. She suggested another piece of apple. Overall terrible experience, will never go back. Wish I could give zero stars.",

We did, last night and everything was on point! They have won us back because everything was fresh, delicious and prepared exactly as  we asked. The server was excellent, courteous and friendly as well. This has always been a favorite spot for informal family dinners and will continue to be.  I applaud Eat'n Park management for the professional way they handled my complaint and how courteous  they were to me. Keep up the great work!!! We will definitely be back soon!!!",

Maybe it's just that I haven't been to an ENP in a long time (probably the better part of a decade), but I was just disappointed.  The service was truly slow (like 10 minutes to get water?).  The salad bar seemed to have half the selection I remember it having.  (No cottage cheese?)  On the upside, the ranch is as tasty as I remember and that was the real reason we went any how.  Then, my order was wrong (I ordered fried pickles... got a burger instead?).  Our server was beyond apologetic and it was fixed in less than five minutes, but hard to understand in the first place...  Interesting to note, we learned that ENP and Sheetz have the same food supplier.  My DH ordered jalapeno poppers and noticed they were virtually identical to the ones he LOVES at Sheetz.  Quick google search later... Yep, same ones.    All in all, a cheap, quick Friday night dinner (even with the delays on ordering, we were still in and out in less than 45 minutes).",

I predict (guess?) that he'll become a famous author someday based solely (superficially?) on his first name. Hopefully, his last name isn't Hawk. That would be tragic.   For some reason this E 'N P's lemonade was different from the lemonade I had at the one in Monaca the night before. This lemonade had pulp in it. Hmmmm...  The Buffalo Chicken Wrap (I got mine with Ranch dressing) is a rather spiffy sandwich. It's tangy of course, due not only to the sauce but also the cheddar. The chicken is thankfully tender. What else to say about it? Oh yeah, there's lettuce and tomato too. Who didn't know that?   Apple pie a la mode; dependable as a Ford pick-up truck, and Eat 'N Park does it more than capably. No wonder people take home whole pies.   When nothing else is open, Eat 'N Park is there for ya, and usually the food ain't bad.   P.S. I am shocked that this Eat 'N Park remained UnYelped until now!",

The real turn off was the extended wait time. Thank god they were not packed. Other patrons were upset about having to wait longer than necessary. There is a definite problem here with management. The waitresses seemed disgusted like they are over worked. They need a new manager and more staff. I sent a complaint to Eat N Park Corporate and got an e-mail from the manager. This was always a nice place to stop for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Not anymore!",

I came during the Sunday Brunch Buffet; my friend partook, I abstained after seeing the fare.  I ordered two eggs over-easy with a side of toast.  Getting beyond the murky, dated feel of the store, it was actually fairly clean on the interior and in the restrooms.    I received my food and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  Maybe not a big deal for some, but you would be surprised at how often over-easy comes out over-hard or, worse, uncooked.  I think the real reason I enjoy Eat 'n Park most of the time is the normal salad bar items.",

    "text": "Eat 'n Park is passable for certain things. The hamburgers are satisfactory and although the salad bar will never be compared to the extraordinary Souplantation/ Sweet Tomatoes, it is not bad.  My wife and I were desperate for food after a late Pittsburgh Pirates game, which left us few choices, and we made the mistake of coming here and ordering the $9.99 Midnight buffet, which was lousy.  The eggs, fried potatoes, hash browns, onions, and mushrooms drowning in liquid, were tasteless.  Pancakes that are stuck to the container in which they are placed are not likely to please and the soggy waffle my wife had was not enjoyable either. If I had been told that the corned beef hash was canned dog food or that it was made with Spam, it would have been believable as there was no hint of beef as it is known to most people. The quality of the food at Golden Corral is spectacular in comparison to Eat 'n Park and the value is infinitely better, $8.99 for a breakfast buffet that includes an extensive salad selection and so much more well-prepared, well-seasoned, tasty items. Breakfast foods are now served there throughout lunch and dinner.  I do not plan to order the Eat 'n Park Midnight Buffet or the breakfast buffet ever again.  If I do, I will deserve my fate.  I continue to have difficulty understanding why Eat 'n Park is such a spectacular success, particularly given that at its other divisions, including Six Penn Kitchen, it has demonstrated that it knows how to prepare appealing cuisine. I would have been much better off at Primanti Brothers, where one can secure a late night feast: half pound cheeseburger with all the trimmings and which includes enough of the area's best french fries for an army, for a mere $8.19.  This Eat 'n Park location has been nicely remodeled.  It is now more spacious, attractive, and comfortable.  There is not much more  that can be said for it than that.",

The \"super burger\" is basically a Big Mac without all the grease,  and is actually quite satisfying. The salad bar is always fresh and kept well stocked (well, sometimes the customers manage to fish out all the chicken and noodles from the chicken noodle soup, leaving only the broth). The service is top-notch, with friendly waitstaff who could teach the waiters and waitresses at some of the more expensive fine dining establishments the area a thing or two about customer service.

Our go to has usually been the Dormont ENP, but if the parking lot is full, we know of a few alternate spots, and Banksville is usually the other option. My daughter, and I (sound familiar?!) have begun making Saturday morning brunch our time to catch up, and eat of course. We found a parking spot without any trouble, and didn't have to wait more than five minutes to be seated. The new building seems to have brightened things up, and the food was good.  My daughter wasn't able to order her usual Caramel Mocha joka drink she likes, the machine was down according to the waitress. We both ordered the Super Griddle Smiles, hers with Banana Foster French Toast, and mine with the Smiley Waffle, yum!  Our food was good, nothing came out greasy, plates were clean, and the food cooked well. The only no biggie issue was my daughter had to wait for her order of potato pancakes, and my order for potato pancakes somehow turned into home fries. I'm not one to freak out over a minor slip like this, but having worked in the industry, the ticket should've been checked, and the plates should've been checked before being served. Attention to detail, that's all. Overall, I'm happy to see the remodels of the Eat N Parks, and don't mind stopping in for breakfast with family, and friends.",

The flat bread is soft and fresh, grilled chicken is delicious and smokey then the cheese, lettuce, fresh salsa, grilled onions and peppers drizzled with chipotle sauce has blown my mind! I didn't think it could be that great so I have ordered it 3x and every single time it's has been consistently delicious. The staff is friendly and gives you that feeling like they know you, I watch different servers attend to different customers and they just had a really great vibe (except for 2, they looked tired as hell and a bit grumpy)! My server, Heather, was great! She told me what was good on the menu what was not, she was totally honest. I love an honest server, don't just say that something is popular or good just to say it. The food is inexpensive and the portions are great.",

I even went back 3 days later for breakfast in the restaurant with 2 friends and breakfast was completely inedible. The manager took the check AFTER belittling us and being snide and rude when I told her that I had missed her call because it was conveniently during work hours. She told me the complaint was invalid and not believable and they had it taped....please review the tape.....soup spilled...person at the window was clueless and wrong pies ....all which was paid for.  I gave you way too many chances. Your food when cooked right is mediocre ...your staff is horribly trained. Your managers are unhelpful and you wasted money re- doing the banks vile eat and park...money would have been better used to teach your cooks how to make real eggs..not the freeze dried carton eggs that you use on the Buffet.  IF....BIG IF we ever go to Eat n Park again it will be the Dormont one..the food is still not great but the servers there are friendly. HUGE Difference.  Please train the staff at the Banksville E&p..they need it Badly.",

Of course this was after she already charge my account then she took both the bills again and credit my account. You would think this would be over but heck no not with Bernadette she again took my card and charged both bills on my account never ever using my brothers card. How does one do this??? All I can say I will never go back and if anyone else goes pay in cash- u will be charged 100 times if u get Bernadette -Laura I already filled out the feedback form on line and nobody got back to me -I'm happy to say that the General Manager Bob called me and my money will be refunded to me.

I imagine the price is the draw but there are plenty of mom and pop places in the same price range with better quality. I've had a wide variety of everything and if you're looking for a McDonald's sit down type restaurant you'll like it. If you're looking for homemade fare don't visit. The salad bar is ok but the salad dressings are not very good aside from the blue cheese. The breakfast buffet is edible not great not terrible. Dennys and IHOP are better choices if you're looking for cheaper chain food. You'd do better by visiting non chain places close by like Blinkys or Coachs.",

    "text": "Hard to believe this Eat N Park has never been reviewed being one of the oldest in the history of the franchise.   Eat N Park is a local franchise, the corporate headquarters are located at the Waterfront in Homestead. A Family restaurant, the menu is extensive, appetizers to salads, burgers to sundaes. It's all here. Who hasn't come here on the weekend to gorge themselves on the midnight buffet? Admit it, we've all imbibed a bit too much and needed something to make the morning hangover less painful.   The grilled bearclaw is a Pittsburgh favorite, sweet pasty dough, cinnamon gooey icing, grilled in butter, served hot from the griddle, with coffee or a large glass of milk, this has been my choice meal after many nights of extreme alcohol consumption.   The Super Burger is their version of the Big Mac. Only made better because it comes served on a dish and not in a cardboard box. With fries, this was a favorite meal when I was growing up.   Breakfast is where Eat N Park shines, they make some awesome blueberry pancakes. Light and fluffy, stuffed with tons of blueberries and warm syrup, this is one of my favorites.   Who can resist a smiley cookie? An awesome sugar cookie with glazed icing, they come in a variety of colors and even Pittsburgh sports team colors when it's playoff time. The famous strawberry pie is another favorite of Pittsburgers. Everyone looks forward to the very berry month of May.   Eat N Park isn't for everyone, but when you crave a bit of the past or need a meal 24 hours a day, Eat N Park will be there.",

I love EnP and we go way back to my teenage days working as a hostess for my first job and then server through college. So I'm a fan for life.   Now my experience is a little different because I have a toddler and I'm gluten free. Of course, it's perfect for kids and their choices are great with many options of fried mac and cheese, grilled cheese, corndogs and so much more.   Now that I'm gluten free, the options are definitely slimmer for me, but I appreciate they have gluten free buns so I can still enjoy a delicious superburger. I also love any of their salads, with fries on top of course. Warning, fries are fried in the same as gluten items, but I just eat them anyway (sorry to my stomach). There's a handful of items that aren't marked gluten free that you can alter to be that way. I often get the bruschetta chicken, but grilled rather than fried. I do wish there were a handful more items to get that are GF, but I'm appreciative there are a few out there to choose from!   I do hope one day they start making gluten free smiley cookies!",

I especially want to take a second to talk about how great Amber (The server) is. She was attentive, easy to talk to, and generally amazing. (She got a good tip from everyone).   As far as food goes... This seems like a top tier Eat'n Park. The bacon was perfectly crispy )how I asked for it), Buffalo chicken fingers were completely coated in buffalo sauce (some location have spotty with the sauce). Those were the highlights.   I have a meeting in the area once a month so I will be back for a good meal and great service from Amber.",

    "text": "Yesterday was my first time ever stepping foot inside of an Eat'n Park and it's probably not a chain I will be returning too. I was staying at the hotel next door so it was super convenient to just walk order, so that's exactly what I did. The staff was friendly when I walked in and discussed the menu with me before I made up my mind and ordered from the takeout area. I ordered the chicken fillets with French fries and mashed potatoes with gravy (I like potatoes, sue me). The food took about 20 minutes to come out and before you know it I was back at my hotel opening up a container of disappointment. I was not expecting a top notch food experience but I was also not expecting 4 chicken fingers that look like they were served at a baseball game with 12 French fries......why would you call it chicken fillets when they are just a few mediocre chicken tenders? On top of that, the French fries lacked pretty much any flavour making them pretty unenjoyable. The mashed potatoes were alright but since they also didn't give me any plastic silver-wear or anything to eat with I was forced to use one of the chicken strips as a spoon, which was great, really great. They throw in a small Cinnabon, a cookie, and roll for free and the roll was alright. The cookie was terrible and I didn't bother trying the Cinnabon.  Overall, I'm going to try and avoid ever returning to a Eat'n Park when I return to Pennsylvania. The food wasn't very good and I'm not going to recommend coming here unless you too stay at the hotel next door.",

The fall menu is now out so the offerings I had at the event are no longer available. They are now serving turkey with all the trimmings.  Service is always fast and the staff are the nicest ones to work with. This one has also been remodeled to include a take out window. The usual menu items are available as well as their renown soup and salad bar. My turkey dinner came with stuffing, gravy, and a side of my choice. It was very good. Pumpkin pie and cake is now in season so make the most of it while you have the opportunity. A person in our group had the rosemary chicken which is another one of my favorites and it did not disappoint.   This Eat n Park has the new check service. You don't have to take your check to the pay area. Prices are very reasonable and you can get a good meal or sandwich or whatever you are interested in. They do change the daily soup menu but they always have chili and chicken noodle soup on the salad bar. It's right off an exit at Banksville Road headed away from the city.  Definitely the place for smiles!",

I was not asked if we want a refill and are app came out after are meal and it was covered in spilled sauces. I wanted to get some cookies to take home because I use to get them as a kid but I had to wait about 10 min in an empty line because there was nobody at the register. I probably would try this place one more time but If it is still bad I will not be returning.",

    "text": "The place for Smile. Oh is it ever! Eat & Park really knows how to make dining a streamlined experienced. They are the classic Pittsburgh family establishment. After starting with one restaurant, they've grown into a chain that has been perfected!   My families kids LOVE this place & I love Eat N Park for providing us with such a stress free dining option. The menu options are extensive. They have something for everyone's dining needs- diabetic, allergies, celiac, small portions for kids & seniors, picky eaters... it's amazing just what they've thought of! I can't think of any other restaurant in the country that offers what Eat N Park does!   Our family has many favorites- just to name a few, the chicken soup is heavenly. As is the fish sandwich w mac & cheese during Lent. There are just so many choices- it really is almost impossible to review just one meal. The thing about Eat N Park is that the menu is straightforward & the calories, ingredients, and all details are readily available upon request. This makes finding a dish that suits ones individual tastes easy and exceptional. Personally, I think you can't go wrong with the hot turkey sandwich & French fries - all covered in gravy. Delicious!  So very delicious!    And we can't forget to mention the Smiley Cookies. They are iconic! Do not leave without having one if you're dining for the first time! The Smiley Cookies are absolutely the best part. Or maybe the stickies are. Or the the pies. No. The Smiley Cookies are the best... or maybe the stickies.  They are all so amazing! You might have to try them all and decide for yourself!",

    "text": "Eat'n Park has always been a neighborhood diner to me but it is so much more than that which I found out thanks to a prior Yelp event.  My husband and I went for dinner the other night as I was in the mood for fresh veggies and their well stocked all you can eat salad bar does  the trick.  They have rotating soups and I had a cup of chicken noodle as well as creamed broccoli (soup of the day) which was fantastic.  I piled every topping possible from bacon, olives, beats and cheese on top of my salad.  They have fruit as well as muffins and breads for sides.  The menu is pretty extensive and my husband went with a grilled flatbread pita type sandwich with chicken.  We saved room for dessert as it was $2 pies for the month. The Oreo cream pie with massive amounts of whipped cream was decadent and I ate every bite.  My husband was pleased with his banana cream pie.  The service was quick and we were in and out in less than hour.",

My friend recently visited and here is his quote:  \"We had a fantastic hostess at enp who happened to have his pronouns on his name tag to allow for his identity while in transition! Glad enp is open and allowing its staff to be who they are!!!!\"  Thank you Banksville ENP for rolling with the times!",

    "text": "I am VERY impressed with the new \"drive thru\" here at Eat N Park. I ordered a Whale of a fish sandwich from the car on the way home tonight. Not only was it ready by the time I got there , it was still piping hot and they even gave me a free cookie! The girl at the window was very energetic and friendly. Excellent Customer service. I love the Pittsburgh Fish tradition at all of the local churches , and I can hardly wait to them to begin the Lent specials. BUT I have to now include this Eat n park to my Friday fish stop. Thank you again to a local Pittsburgh company.",

I'm all about any place that serves veggie burgers and Mac n cheese bites 247. Staff is always friendly and I don't care what anyone says I love a smiley cookie!",

    "text": "I used to frequent this regularly, until I moved out of town.  I came back and was very disappointed with the service I received today.  When the waitress finally made it to the table she gave the impression she did not want to wait on us. When we were able to order, it seemed like it took forever to get the food.  The place was pretty empty, so that could not be the reason.  I ordered a slice of pie for dessert, and that took over 10 minutes for the pie to arrive.  I also had to ask to get my water refilled, which again took about 10 minutes.  Then when we paid the cashier, she shorted us $10.  I guess I should have counted the change before I left.  I doubt I will ever go back here again.",
