I am not vegan, but I was impressed by the number of vegan options, which were all quite tasty! We will definitely return!",

Ok do u see were things are going. I ordered the chicken curry with garlic bread. Took like 30 min with an empty restaurant, unbelievable! They use dark meat in thier curries and it was cooked so far thru that it became shreds and the naam was burnt from behind. Overall not a good experience food was one of the worst I had in Pittsburgh. Will not be back.",

I've become a fan of Indian food, and this place has the largest variety of any Indian buffet I've ever been to--an extensive salad bar, appetizer-type foods, chutneys, at least eight different entree-type dishes (including vegetarian and vegan options), two types of rice, naan, dosa, three desserts, chai tea... It's about $10 per person, and with ID, students get a $1 discount on the buffet ($2 off entrees). I had a great time trying to sample everything and enjoyed it all.  The owner was friendly and our glasses of water were kept full. My only complaint is that we were seated by the door, so whenever it opened, we got a blast of chilly air.  I had a great lunch here, and the next time I want lots of Indian food, I'm going here for sure!",

    "text": "Went there on a Sunday night (14th Feb) for a regular dinner service. I had heard a few good things about the food here and a few not so good things about the service but still decided to give it a try. A couple of my friends joined my wife and I for this visit. The visit started going down hill the moment we entered the restaurant. We were greeted by one of the waitresses who asked us to sit right beside a huge glass window on a very cold night. We respectfully asked if we could sit somewhere else since most of the r restaurant was empty (there may have been 3 other tables that were taken and at least 20 or so empty ones. We were very rudely reminded of the fact that this was a 'fine dining' restaurant and we didn't have a choice of where we could sit. We decided to comply with this 'rule' like unwilling teens in a classroom but to our amusement the table we were seated on hadn't even been cleaned properly. So much for it being a 'fine dining' restaurant. When we asked the same waitress to kindly clean the tables we got the look that sent a thousand daggers flying our way. She however cleaned up the table and we went to get the food from the buffet spread as that was the only option for the night ($15.99 +tax per person).   I was pleasantly surprised by the food which turned out to be good. There was a stark disparity in the food and the service which was meted out to us. There was decent variety and I would like to mention the goat curry and the Indo Chinese noodles (Chow Mein) which were cooked perfectly. Our water was never filled up and the first time we asked for it the same waitress showed up after 10 minutes. Our plates were not cleared away as well even after waiting a few minutes and trying to flag her down. We would have understood had the restaurant been full and if she was the only one working. Also in case you are expecting the customer to tip you at a buffet, I think keeping the water full and the plates cleared would go a long way. There were 2-3 tables that were occupied at this point of time not including ours. The second time we tried to flag her down for some more water she walked down to the table and almost shouted at us that she wasn't waiting on our table anymore and we should ask another waitress for water. All this while she was hanging out at the billing counter. When we asked her if she could inform the other waitress that we need water she said she must have already heard us and might bring out the water. At that point we did get the feeling that if we hung around to drink that water although we were very thirsty we might actually be victims of one of the stories we had heard about waitresses spitting into the water etc. We decided to just leave and paid for our food upfront. We tried talking to the gentleman at the counter who looked like the manager but we didn't really get the feeling that he was too interested in listening to what we had to say. Maybe the restaurant is doing well and the owners are happy with their turnover. In my opinion when the customer is asked to spend above $17 on a buffet the least you could do is treat them with respect. I don't think I will be taking my business there again. Actually I would be almost afraid to go their again and ordering off the menu if the same waitress brings out my food.",

I'm veggie and my husband - a non vegetarian.  1. Buffet didn't have veggie biryani or a non - veg biryani.  2. Items in the buffet were not tasty and we not even appealing 3. They had sarson ka saag and makki dii roti. I only liked the taste particular dish from buffet - I felt like having a second serving - the second one had a long hair strand in the curry - it came into my mounth. Ekkkk.... At ones I didn;t like to taste any other dishes. 4. My husband additionally ordered a lamb biryani as he didn't like the taste of the non- veg items in the buffet - the biryani was horrible, tasted like tamarind rice with lamb pieces half cooked. 5. When we complained to the manager - there was no proper treatment/ reception.   PLEASE DO NOT go by the ratings. This is worst restaurant and we have regrets of not going into resular visit place - tamarind restaurant and for having tried this one going by the ratings.",

My first loyalty to an Indian restaurant was The Prince of India, but now that I eat less meat, I've come to appreciate All India.  Coriander, in Squizill, also good, but very meat-driven.  All India makes a wonderful makhani fish, which is out of this world if you're into fish curries.  They also pride themselves on A-class presentation, and they prepare many, many options that are authentic dishes not available at the other restaurants around town.",

I consider myself a risk taker.  Enter inside and I feel like I've been transported into a dimly lit mini mansion that has goblets (yes, really!) to hold your water. Can't forget the nice TVs with bollywood music on the screen showcasing beautiful people doing outrageous dance moves. Banquet room in the back for private parties. Pretty unique venue.   FOOD This is a review of the buffet. What a spread! Chickpea curry, saag, goat curry (yeah, baby!), chicken curries, sweet and sour chicken/broccoli/mushrooms, tandoori chicken, and the list goes on. Along with raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, these are some of my favorite things. And the garlic naan! Mmm, All India got my stomach singing the \"sound of music\". Food is always piping hot and refilled at the buffet when low.   SERVICE Typical buffet service. Sometimes water takes a while to come around. Pay at the counter by the buffet after you finish.  IMPRESSIONS I come here at least twice a month for a reason! $1 off the lunch buffet if you have a student ID, which comes out to $9. What a steal! I've been to some indian buffets and this has to the biggest spread and the best price. Also, drinking out of a goblet makes me feel like Lil Jon. Will I be back soon? WHAT! Will I be back soon?

    "text": "Went to All India with a friend who was in town and staying nearby. Luckily since it was Pitt's spring break, we easily found a spot on one of the side streets. I've since heard that there is a small lot behind the building, so maybe can park there next time.  There was only one other table filled when we showed up on a Monday evening, and after they left, only one other group came and we were there a little over 2 hours. I thought a buffet would be a good place to catch up with my friend since we wouldn't feel like we were keeping waitstaff from a paying table like at a restaurant. I didn't expect it to be that empty though. We were done eating after probably 45 minutes-1 hr, but the waitress kept our water cups filled and let us take our time chatting. We didn't feel rushed at all and she brought our check when we decided we were ready for it.  Not the best Indian restaurant, but the buffet is pretty big with a ton of vegetarian options. We loved the manchurian mushrooms. I liked that there were a bunch of dishes that I've never seen at Indian buffets before.I thought the food was good and didn't taste dried out, or like it had been sitting on the buffet too long. We saw them changing out dishes while we were there.  I've defintiely had better Indian food at other places, but like the choices this buffet offers, and it's close, so really easy for us to get to. I'd defintiely go back.",

My only small comment is that everything is richer than it has to be. I've had similar examples elsewhere that aren't as heavy. I also appreciate how balanced the heat level is on all of their dishes. There's a definite range. Tamarind, for example, is just hot.  Every dish is too hot. Not here. Another remarkable thing about their food is their use of fresh vegetables in many of their dishes. You rarely see such an abundant variety of freshly prepared vegetables.  Back off the fats a little and I would be here all the time.  There's too many cream and cheese based dishes with fried veg balls floating in them.",

I was originally going to an Indian spot a block away because there were more reviews for this place but after tasting their tamarind sauce I was very very disappointed. So I ended up walking down the street to this little spot hidden off behind a bar or beer distributor.  From the outside it looks almost too small to be anything more than a fast food spot but one inside it opens up beautifully  and extends past the main dining room to a private area for larger dinner parties. They have a decent bar with seating for about 6 as well as an awesome array of fresh made beverages like tea and lassi. They serve water in these goblets which I'm not too fond of since its metal and I don't like the feel of the metal on my lips so I just ask for a normal glass.  They serve their version of chips and dips which is basically these thin crisp with three different sauce. Tamarind, a pickled chile's mixture and some green dip. My favorite is definitely the tamarind because its so sweet and thick but the mixed chile's come in a close second. I believe you only get the chips if you order off the regular menu which we did on our first visit but It was a Thursday and they offered the buffet on this day and Sunday only.  So after deciding on drinks we made our way up to the buffet. Man were there so many amazing options. Every label listed whether the item was gluten free or vegan which was a good comfort. They had tea at the beginning of the buffet followed by a chickpea dish surrounded with fresh bread and elegantly decorated. The salad bar was great too with different sauces to put on your salad other than ranch and italian. They also had an amazing fruit salad which was pineapples mixed in a mango based pudding like sauce, Delicious!! After the salad where various types of  curried sauces at least 5 to 6 along with jasmine rice and basmati rice. They had these mushrooms that literally tasted like general tso's sauce and they were sweet and crunchy that I almost forgot I was eating mushrooms. At the end of the hot foods was your meat choices like chicken tandoori and curried fish, chicken and goat.   On top of all the food they had dessert was a great ending to this wonderful array of choices. They offered whose pancakes balls soaked in a thin syrup like base and something known as fried sugar shaped similar to pretzels. I wasn't too fond of the fried sugar because it tasted too much like the oil that it was fried in and that wasn't a pleasant taste in my opinion. After finishing our meal we let our food settle and enjoyed some interesting tea that had a distinct taste of cinnamon and some other spice. I drank it without sugar which was a great choice because it ruins the flavor.  It was my hubbys first time here but it won't certainly be his last. The best part is that the buffet was only $10 a person!!! Such a great deal for all the food we had to try. It was totally worth it in my opinion!! See you guys soon.",

They have a number of non-vegetarian appetizers and main course curries too. There are generally 2-3 desserts: gulab jamun, gajar barfi, rice kheer etc. The salad bar includes atleast two fruits, numver of Indian chutnies, raita, and other salad items.

The manager didn't even make the effort to see what was going on besides quickly taking away the plate with the chewed-out band-aid. He just kept sending over the poor waitress who would relay nonsensical excuses like 'oh it must have been paper' or 'it could have slipped off another customer so we can't do anything about that.'   When I went up to confront the manager, he kept repeating how he doesn't know what I want him to do about it.   Take my words or leave it, that's up to you--but the owner of this restaurant clearly doesn't take potential health hazards seriously.   Does this place have good food? Yes.

The spread during our visit included a salad bar with various hot sauces and chutneys, perhaps half a dozen vegetable/legume/paneer dishes, at least 3 chicken options including Tandoori, Tikka Masala, and Chili Chicken, a Goat Curry, and a breaded and fried fish dish.  Also available were 2 vegetarian soups, multiple bread and rice options, and 2 desserts: Gulab Jamun and Jalebis.    My favorite dishes were the creamy (vegan!) Navaratna Korma with cauliflower, peas, lima beans, green beans, and potato chunks in a nutty green sauce, as well as the sweet and slightly spicy and sweet Chili Chicken.  A lot of reviews complain about a lack of spice in the spread, but the hot sauces can be used to add heat to any dish.  As an infamous chili head to my friends, I was not disappointed.    The dining room was pretty empty for lunch on Saturday around noon, and the service was efficient at refilling our water and clearing our plates.  Despite the slightly sketchy outward facade, the venue cute inside with the typical Indian restaurant-style kitschiness.  We will definitely be back for future gorge sessions.",

    "text": "Tried the buffet at All India - probably the largest Indian buffet I've seen (and they have it for lunch and dinner, 7 days a week)! An unbelievable amount of vegetarian options (which is always a plus for me) with all the classics you'll be hoping for and plenty of options you may not have tried before. I enjoyed the experience at All India from start to finish. Though their buffet seems to be very popular, there were plenty of take out orders going on. They have a very small lot in front, but for Oakland, street parking is relatively easy to find. Worth a trip!",

Came here for the lunch buffet, which was $9 with the student discount.    As for the food options, there were plenty of vegetarian dishes. This is the first Indian buffet I've been to that serves fish on their buffet. All the dishes were fresh and tasty. As for spice level, this buffet is not spicy at all. The naan was a bit too thick for my liking, I wish they were thinner. The chai tea was delicious though! After stuffing your face, I highly recommend washing it all down with a warm cup of chai.    If you are looking for a good Indian buffet in the area with many vegetarian options and little spice level, this is your place. Comparing to other Indian restaurants in the area, the heat at All India is pretty tame. I left with all my taste buds intact.",

The tikka masala, mattar paneer, mustard greens, and broccoli manchurian are my favorite dishes, but I've never had anything that wasn't excellent from the buffet. The variety is huge, with lots of choices for both meat eaters and vegetarians. The bread is always excellent, which is not so at many other buffets, as are the desserts. The service is very friendly, and the interior of the restaurant is comfortable and nicely decorated. Also, they offer lunch and dinner buffets every day, so no need to try to remember what days are buffet days. I highly recommend All India!",

The fried donut like things in particular were incredible!  I think that $10 is a tad steep at least for me for lunch, but the quality was good.

This was just bland. On the plus side it was very gluten free / vegan friendly. I might return if someone needed that. Otherwise I doubt I would go back. Also the chicken chili was pretty good.",

I can't make it over there during the day so we went one Sunday night for the dinner buffet--awesome!  Many, many veggie indian dishes along with a few for the carnivores, masala chai, and plenty of dessert and naan options.  I also love the atmosphere--they have Bollywood videos and music playing, and lots of colorful lanterns and string lights.  The service is a little slow for those of us who like it spicy--at one point I felt like I was going to die because my water glass had been empty for so long and I have an unfortunate affinity for chili peppers.  Other than that, this place is perfect and it might have just been because they were SO busy.  Because it's awesome! :)",

I'll have to sample the standard menu before passing judgment on the rest of the restaurant.  The lunch buffet is, for lack of a better word, sprawling. There are plenty of vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices available as well as soup, salad, dessert, etc. Pretty much your standard buffet fare, but with a wider variety than usual.  Decor inside is clean and modern, and although the service is a little spotty, that's probably just due to opening pains.",

Very large selection (including a lot of vegetarian dishes). Most of the time, you go to an Indian buffet and, before you even get there, you already know what there will be because a lot of places just phone it in with the usual palak paneer, aloo gobi, chicken tikka masala, etc. While all those were present here, they had a lot of things I've never gotten to try before, like jalebi (think India's answer to a funnel cake), that were delicious. Really, the only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the one shrimp dish on the buffet (which suffered from overcooked shrimp).   Furthermore, I was greatly impressed by the staff actually seeking my opinion on the buffet and looking for constructive criticism. It shows that they actually care and want to make it an enjoyable dining experience for their patrons. Places like Oakland have no shortage of Indian restaurants but this is going to be my go-to for Indian when I'm in the area.   Definitely give it a try.",

Really nice attractive interior decor in here .  Very very colorful and cheery looking inside whereas some other Indian restaurants can be very dingy and just eerie, inside.  This guy has spent a lot of cash on the interior decor, for sure . My only complaint is that the hours of operation are listed as 11:30 - on but they will tell you they are not open yet or that the food is not ready until 12:00 noon or so .  I wish they'd resolve that issue or just change their hours to 12:00 - on .   Highly recommended you try the buffet to sample a wide variety of their dishes .",

The food is artfully and thoughtfully prepared, with spice levels that changed from dish to dish, and truly interesting flavor combinations. I was blown away. I can't remember the last time I ate at an Indian buffet where the choices were so many that I couldn't sample everything. You actually need a game plan when dining here. They offered the mini masala dosa with sambar and coconut chutney on my visit. While the mini dosas aren't as crispy as the larger ones I've had (probably because they make them ahead of time) these were still delicious, and the sambar was excellent. Everything was excellent, from the veg pakora, which were perfectly fried and delicious, to the dal, which was rich and creamy, to the fresh broccoli and potatoes, the eggplant masala, the saag paneer...I could go on, but you get the drift. They had 3 dessert choices too. Over the top. The best part is, if you can't get to the lunch buffet, they serve up a dinner buffet on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. I can't wait to go back.",

NOW, for why I unfortunately have to leave 1 star and will not be returning: one member of my party found an already smoked CIGARETTE BUTT in their food. You heard that right folks.   We brought this to the attention of the staff, who brought over a manager. The manager did not apologize, but rather outlined all the ways he didn't think this was his staffs fault and it must have been a customer that threw it in there in the buffet line. I obviously have no proof of how it got in there, but it seems way more likely that this happened in the kitchen (accidental or not). Either way, there is no way for the manager to have truly known for sure that this wasn't his staff. We NEVER got an apology of any kind and we got zero assurance that they were doing anything about this. This truly ruined the night for our group and we all immediately lost our appetite. Despite the fact that we all had already eaten this dish that had been simmering with a cigarette butt, only that 1 member of our party got their meal comped, which we had to ask for.",

    "text": "I've been to all of the Indian Restaurants in Pittsburgh. ALL INDIA is the BEST of them all. Hands down. Their buffet selection is the best there is in the entire city. Loooove the goat curry especially. I'm an Indian foodie and this restaurant is one of the best things about Pittsburgh. I don't even bother with Tamarind across the street, People's India, or any other place nearby. (Tamarind doesn't even have free chai for buffet.) Sometimes they bring you FRESH hot naan to the table (especially during busy hours). My Indian friends that go with me rave about the food here too, so, go figure!  I literally go to eat there every week so I think it speaks for itself. One thing I noticed is they've been cutting back on selections a little (they used to have mango lassi with buffet, etc) but I think it's because they are keeping the value very high without price gauging.",

    "text": "I used to have an Indian restaurant I frequented weekly, sadly it closed down.  It took some time - but a friend finally discovered All India that was pretty equivilant to my old restaurant.  At many Indian restaurants - there is a TON of oil in the food.  It \"floats to the top\" and just sits there.  At All india - there is no oil making a mess in your food.  All India is the best Indian buffet I've had in Pittsburgh.  In all honesty - I have NO doubt that their regular/non-buffet food is fantastic.    I don't frequent All India enough - but when I do the service is impeccable, the food is phenomenal and it's just all around perfection.  They have a HUGE variety for vegetarians/vegan and meat eaters alike.  They have all the food clearly labeled and an abundance of naan.    Whether you go for lunch or dinner - All India will never disappoint - You will always leave fulfilled with some scrumptious food and tea!",

They also have a full menu you can order from if you don't want the buffet option. I was really looking forward to chicken korma, but they didn't have it on the buffet. But even without that I still enjoyed the options they had. The spinach was very very tasty! It almost tasted as if it was a cream of spinach, but the cream wasn't visible. Which was good because the spinach wasn't too running, but extra tasty. The naan they had was bomb dot com!!!  Probably the best naan I've ever eaten!! I really enjoyed the music videos they had playing as well, they really set the tone, which went great along with the decor. I would recommend this place if you enjoy Indian food!",

    "text": "I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and had the buffet both times.  I have no regrets because this buffet is completely awesome.    My experience here started when I walked in the door and smelled food.  Not just any food, though: delicious food with reasonable spiciness.  I walked further in and got a table, and the smell just got stronger.  Everything here is labeled as to whether it's vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free.  The entire salad bar area is gluten-free, the pakora and idli are gluten-free, the rices are gluten-free, and a bunch of the curries are too.  I don't know about the meat dishes because I'm vegetarian, and even if you eat meat you're likely to get caught up on all the delicious veg stuff before you even make it down to where the meat is.  So labeling is taken care of, and you probably know what you can and can't eat at this point.    For me being allergic to part of the available offerings was probably to my advantage, because the food here is amazing and if there were more stuff I could have eaten I'd have been at risk for eating until I hurt or possibly making myself sick.  I regret that I had only one stomach to offer for each meal, but I'd like to think that I made the best use of it I could and tried everything I thought I could handle, all of which was delicious and well-made.  I was also delighted to find a few dishes I hadn't encountered before in my various travels - I'm pretty familiar with Indian food, I cook a lot of it at home, and I'd like to think I know my stuff decently.  So when I encounter a dish I'm not familiar with in an environment where I know it's safe to try it, that's pretty much the best thing ever.    The food is delicious, service is good, the space is nice, and the biggest thing I am sad about is that I don't live in Pittsburgh so I can't go here very often.",

The butter chicken from All India was just not perfect. The sauce was a little thin and runny, not thick and creamy like I enjoy. I had two tendons in my dish, too, which is hard to know before you bite into it because it's all hidden in the sauce. Another reason I gave a mediocre rating is because of how long my order took. I was promised 40 mins, but the kitchen took so long to make my dish that I ended up getting it over an hour and fifteen minutes after my initial order. Almost double the time I was told. I understand restaurants are busy, but that seemed a little ridiculous.",

My experience was generally all right as it provide good service, and variety in their buffet however, the taste was missing. A few dishes were okay so you won't leave empty stomach. Almost all gravy dishes were oddly sweet. They can work on the spice level without making dishes sweet otherwise the ambience and service are up for a good restaurant. I liked their desserts and are posted.",

We both did the buffet which was expansive and had a lot of dishes to offer, all labeled/with descriptions which was very helpful. They had an expansive number of vegetarian dishes which was great. Dessert and chai tea was also included in the buffet price. The service was great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and can't wait to go back!  Extra fun touch-they had Bollywood movies playing on several screens which was fun to watch/listen to the music.",

Last time we ordered, we ordered mutter paneer and and there was not a single pea in the dish. It was a few cubes of paneer in sauce.   Tonight we placed a $60 order. Besides completely leaving out one of our entrees our mutter paneer was all peas maybe five cubes of paneer. We called to ask about our forgotten entree and the girl on the phone asked if they could take care of it at a later date. We said no we wanted to eat our dinner tonight.   Very disappointing as this was one of our go to late night take out spots.  Won't be ordering again.",

I'm not sure which one is better though. Will probably have to go a few more times to decide. What I can say for sure is that this place has more options. There were lots of vegetarian options and meat options as well. I came in for the lunch buffet on a Saturday and for $11.99 it's not a bad deal. My favorites on the buffet was the curry goat and the paneer spinach. Will go back for sure soon!",

The atmosphere is pretty authentic, nice, upscalish with nice decor with a traditional touch. The buffet food offerings are just terrific and very flavorful. Refreshed constantly and hot. This is easily my first choice in the Burgh for Indian buffet.",

The only veggies were mixed frozen veggies. Literally it's the bag you find in the freezer aisle with peas, corn, carrots, and lima beans. Weird and not great. It also did not have any raisins or nuts like it states.   The raita that comees with it was good. Typical raita. The mint chutney was... eh. A little bland for me but not awful.   The cheese naan was good and bad. There were some charred parts that were really yummy. The less cooked bits were only ok. I've actually never had cheese naan before, only plain and garlic. The texture was way different than I was used to. Thicker. But that might be because it's cheese, not sure.   It also took about 25 min longer to get delivered to me than initially quoted. So all in all, pretty average experience. Definitely would NOT get the veggie biryani again.",

There's a large amount of choices on the buffet and I think I tasted every one of them.  Fresh fruit and salad, chai tea, paneer, lentil soups, currys of chicken and goat and lots vegetables, stews, naan bread, chutneys, dumplings, and desserts.  The spices were spot on and everything was so flavorful.  I was impressed at how many items were offered.  They also clearly note gluten free and vegan dishes.   The dining room was very clean and spacious.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive.    Enjoyable.  They have 3 parking spots and you would be lucky to get one.  This whole area has on street parking, up a side street would be your best bet of finding a spot.  The food is worth the parking hassle.",

My favorites at the buffet (though I believe you should try a little of everything)!  -Hot chai tea -Appetizer bar sauces: get the fried veggie fritter balls and pour the red, brown, and green sauces / chutneys on them.  -Chicken tikka masala -Poori (fried puffy bread) and naan (bread in the back) -Aloo gobi (fried cauliflower) - saag paneer (cooked spinach ) - biryani with nuts and raisins   Sometimes they chance the buffet up in terms of variety, but this is what I come for!  The service has an attitude, or resting grump face. Pay at the counter. Don't leave too much wasted food on your plate or they may threaten to charge you a wastefulness fee.   I love the Bollywood music videos they play here, but this last time I went, I was bummed because the music of the restaurant was not the music that matched up to the music videos.  More dancing!",

The chicken was dry in a good way, with all the spices in there =). The dosa is soooo good, i wish i grabbed more! I will definitely be getting much more dosa next time I come.  I would say this place is the best indian place in oakland, much better than prince of india, with tamarind being a pretty close second.   I will probably try sitting in soon =).",

I took off a star just because the service is a little lacking, but for a buffet it isn't bad. I also wish they'd use cups that can fit more than 3 sips of water.

However, All India has changed my mind about that.  Finding a place to eat recently has become a real chore.  We both have dietary restrictions that we really have to do our research in order to find a place that can accommodate both of us.  Our luck brought us here, and our luck also brought us to a buffet.  I had never been here before so I had no idea that they do have a very small parking lot located up front as well as street parking.  If you do choose to park out front just be mindful of the limited space and you may have to squeeze to get in and out of your vehicle.  Walking in I was impressed at the decor.  It looks very elegant and authentic in here.  The televisions are broadcasting Indian music videos which made it feel even more authentic.  Once inside you are greeted and led to a seat and the rest is kind of do it at your own pace.  The servers are constantly circling the restaurant to make sure to clear away the plates and to make sure your cup is filled.  The buffet has a lot to offer, so if you are like me and a bit skeptical about the food, but that to the side.  I enjoyed everything I tasted off here.  My favorite thing was the Chicken Tiki Masala.  Every time I went to the buffet I made sure I got some of that.  I also enjoyed the spinach and cheese, curried potato and cauliflower, and the cheese and lotus seed balls.  Dessert was amazing as well.  The cheese balls in syrup was amazing.  Those things tasted like pancakes and made me want more.  I see a return visit in my future.",

It was a buffet, which meant there was very little that the waiter could do to upset the experience - and he managed to hit all the right spots with little effort ! When asked for water well into the meal ( there were no water glasses on the table to begin with ) , the waiter was visible annoyed and told us that he was one person running the show and we would have to wait ( there were other servers there - and why would you seat someone , serve them spicy food and not give them water ! ) . When asked for the used plates to be cleared out from the table so we could get seconds his reply was - you just got your water - wait ! So we ended up eating from stacked plates just because we did not want to get yelled at! He was equally rude to other customers as well ( when someone told him there were no plates at the buffet  table , he said well they are washing them now , you ll have to wait - there is nothing I can do about it ) . All this for a below average Indian buffet ! I can't believe someone from the service industry could treat a paying customer this way !",

I notice that a lot of businesses in Oakland play fast and loose with safety standards because they think students don't care or don't deserve better. The tables, glassware, and silverware here are of questionable cleanliness and eating at the buffet was like gambling at a casino. The tongs seemed to often lie into the trays which is super gross and a lot of the dishes had clearly been sitting out way too long. By how desiccated the tandoori chicken looked, I suspected it had been untouched for at least 3 hours. I was so afraid to eat a bunch of dishes that I simply stuck with naan that came directly out of the kitchen (which was well baked).   The decor and ambience were also pretty tacky -- pop music videos played the entire time. I guess businesses like this would have to start charging more to increase the quality of the food here, which I think is both fair and necessary!",

It was also priced really well for dinner for $12.99/person I believe. This place is also BYOB and they didn't charge a cork fee! The servers were nice but just not top notch. We were sat close to the door and wanted to move to a table further back to not be hit with cold air when the door opened. But we were told those other tables were reserved..even though no one else came in while we we there. They were also slow on water refills which can be problematic when you're eating spicy Indian food. Other than that I enjoyed the experience overall and would come back.",

I had tried to order from them before; I'd placed an order, then 45 minutes later it was just...cancelled. I was miffed, considering I was expecting a delivery by that point. I wasn't really excited about the prospect of attempting another order with them, but it was late, their delivery fee was low, and we were all in agreement that Indian food was cool with the crew, so we went with it.   Things arrived and weren't packaged great; there was sauce all over the containers where one of the entrees had leaked. Two friends each ordered the butter chicken and were satisfied. I had the chana masala and was not a fan. Chana masala is my go-to at Indian restaurants, and I am a low spice level folk. I generally order a 1 on a 5 scale and a 2 on a 10 scale. This was a 2 on a 10 scale and definitely seemed like more of a 6 or 7. The flavor was not like any other chana masala I'd had either, and it wasn't great.  I doubt I'll make another order with All India when People's is around and hasn't failed me yet.",

As other people have said, they have really let their standards slide probably because of the college students from around Oakland.  I know when I was a college student I didn't care if a place was greasy dirty or if there was a mouse running across the floor. In fact a restaurant I used to eat all the time, that's exactly what you would see is a mouse running across the floor, and the cat was often right behind it. But that's another story. I digress.   No actually this place used to rock, big time, but now they're just nasty and greasy. In fact the last time I was in there a couple of weeks ago, I almost could skate across the floor there was such a surface of grease. The table I sat at also had a layer of grease on it. My elbows slid.   Now I don't know about you, but that's a real turn turn-off for me. The food is decent, but you just can't eat there it's so nasty. In my opinion the only solution would be to shut the place down for a few days to a week and get some heavy-duty detergent and a power washer and just clean the place head to toe. It's that bad.",

But pretty much everything else leaves a lot of room for improvement. There are at least 4 or 5 waiters roaming around in circles, and you're never sure which one is actually the one taking care of you. The vindaloo lamb I ordered had a pretty good sauce but was skimpy on the lamb and not properly trimmed. It seemed from the get-go the waiter assumed we were both getting the buffet, because why bother with anything else. Our check took at least 10 minutes to arrive.  Decor bordered on psychedelic. Cutlery was slightly ridiculous, drinking out of metal chalice cups. Authentic it certainly isn't. Just know what you're going in there for.",

Even the bread that is set out in the buffet is prepared ahead of time and just brought in periodically from the kitchen.  the chai tea is lukewarm and anybody who knows how to drink India tea knows that it should be moderately hot or one wants to puke.     Bringing these points up to the waitstaff or manager does one no good.  They say that they go by what the governing body for Pittsburgh requires and it leaves a lot to be desired for the True Indian cuisine experience.  If their intended target is college kids in that area, food may be acceptable but not to a seasoned Indian food lover.",

Both the lunch and dinner buffet has a long counter of ample vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. You get samosas, pakoras, customizable chaat, dosa/vegetable idli and mouth watering pao-bhajji (takes you back to Bombay street side pao-bhajji joints seriously!) for appetizer. Besides you can have salad, main course (biriyani pulao, paneer, daal makhani,gobi, egg-plant, sambar, chicken curry, chicken tandoori, mutton curry, fish, shrimp...you name it, you get it). They have Indian sweets for desserts too! You'll definitely want to eat more than your appetite can take. Besides buffet, I had also tried andhra spicy dosa from the menu, which was great too! the way they serve the food is pretty neat and impressive too. I'll also recommend the Mango lassi, which is a must-try if you have some space left after a sumptuous meal.  Everytime I dine here, I've never been dissapointed. If you are looking for some authentic Indian food and some peaceful atmosphere to dine, it has to be All India on S. craig street. It's Truely a awesome treat. some of my non-Indian friends have become a great fan too. It has become our weekly dining place for us.",

Made me wish I were sitting there instead of getting takeout.  I only wished I had more room in the to-go container so I could try more of the different yummy dishe!.    This is one of the few Indian restaurants that have seafood dishes in addition to the usual vegetarian and chicken dishes, and I was so glad they had the shrimp tikka masala in the buffet line too.  The eggplant dish was cooked in this unique addicting peanut gravy which was different from most others I've had.  The tandoori chicken was succulent and perfect - not dry like some other tandoori chicken I've had before.  The kofta, saag, curry, and manchurian dishes were also perfectly seasoned, and I appreciated that they were not TOO spicy.  Wish I could have tried the large variety of desserts too!  There were some I've never seen even at other good Indian restaurants.  Will definitely be coming back - maybe next time I'll ask for 2 buffet takeout containers!  :)",

Now, admittedly I'm no expert on Indian food, but I have to say that All India has the best Indian food I've ever had.  I got the Chicken Tikka Masala, which is my favorite Indian dish, and I thought it was absolutely incredible - I like to get it as hot as it can get, but the spiciness was not overpowering.  It was just right.  The flavor was rich and delicious.  My friend got the Butter Chicken and he let me try it, and that was also amazing.  The naan was out of this world, very buttery and soft and flavorful.  It definitely beats the naan I've had at other places.  We also got the All India Platter as an appetizer - chicken tikka, lamb kabab, samosa, fish amritsari, and vegetable pakora - and everything on it was marvelous.  The service was excellent and very generous with refilling drinks.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was wonderful, very nice, and low-key lighting.  I would go back here in a heartbeat and I'm going to recommend it to all of my friends.  Thank goodness it's close to where I work!!",

    "text": "I came here with two friends last night for dinner after Bhangra in the Burgh (a Punjabi dance competition).  I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile, given the positive reviews, and this presented the perfect opportunity to do so.  We weren't able to try the buffet, since it was a Sat. night, so we all decided to get different versions of the thali and share dishes, which gave us a good sampling of the offerings.  Based on this sampling, I (and both of my friends) felt that the quality of the dishes was somewhat uneven.  I ordered the non-veg thali, one friend ordered the curries and grill thali, and the other ordered the vegetarian thali.  The chicken tandoori was pretty good, but rather small in quantity, and the chicken tikka masala was mediocre and kind of oily (I've had much better quality versions of this dish elsewhere).  I didn't try the lamb curry, since I don't eat lamb, but my friends tried it and said it was decent.  The same could be said for the garlic naan (hard to mess that up).  The rice pudding was quite bland--I could hardly taste the seasoning that's customarily included with this dish.  My friend who ordered the curries and grill thali found the goat curry that comes with it inedible.  He hadn't eaten goat before, so he tried one piece and found that it consisted of a bone with very little meat, and then tried another, which was gristly, and then another, which was tough--at that point, he gave up.  He found the other dishes okay to decent.  The same applies to my friend who ordered the vegetarian thali.  We ordered spice levels of 3-4, and found them significantly hotter than we'd like.  Good thing the yogurt-cucumber sauce was included, and we ordered lassi...  I think our experience can be best summed up in the words of my one friend: \"I've had better Indian food\" [down the street].  Given the high ratings, I was expecting to enjoy my meal more, and for the food quality to be more consistent across the board.  Having said that, I understand that this place is primarily known for their buffet, which I'll have to return to try (I'll update if/when I do).  The aspect of our experience that we enjoyed the most was watching the Bollywood-esque Hindi music videos, and noticing that the lights were synchronized to the music.  3.5 stars.",

Quite the selection and I loved the fact that they included what the traditional name of the items were AND the Americanized version for those that aren't familiar. The goat curry was very delicious but contained bones in 3/4 of my bites so that was a little discouraging. There wasn't a place in their buffet just for silverware and napkins and I was very lost on that aspect and had to ask, but I was quickly directed and helped.   Everything tasted great!

They have meat/vegi/vegan options so they have something for everyone. the buffet options are a little limited but its a case of quality over quantity which is what I personally look for.   They have alot of space inside so their is lots of seating room and they have TV entertainment and its very distracting which is good/bad depending on the situation. They have free parking but its small and street parking is busy/pricey in that area.       Pros: The food is good and satisfying they have lots of space     Cons: Need more parking space but that's alot to ask for in Oakland most places only offer street parking so its still a kinda plus.",

The deep fried appetizers taste like they're from the freezer. The naan is thin and crispy and stale. The menu is pretty big, but lacks some of my usual favorites (e.g. aloo mattar... they have mattar vindaloo which they claim is equivalent, but it's not the same sauce or spices). The plain sweet lassi, both of the two times I've ordered it, was definitely spoiled (you can taste that the yogurt has turned).   Service: Usually friendly and attentive. Last time we went, though, people weren't very nice. But this doesn't factor into my review, star wise, as I don't care that much about service.   Ambiance: First thing you see when you come in is a huge sure that's always got Bollywood videos. This would be fine, but the volume they play them at is insane. Was hard to talk. But I noticed that there are only speakers on one side of the room so maybe the other side would be better.",

It's on the last page. You get some form of an appetizer, 3 different dishes, rice, raita, and DESSERT. One of them even comes with Ayran.  This is one of the best deals I've seen for the amount of food you get, and I was really happy with the quality. The paneer was above average. However, the lentil dish was a bit too heavy and boring for my tastes. It wasn't bad though. Oh, and the samosa was on point as well. Really I have no room to complain because my vegetarian thali came with rice pudding and rice pudding is basically the best thing on the face of the earth (aside from sushi..STEP OFF)  I will definitely stop back here and check out the lunch buffet.  :D",

    "text": "I never thought I'd say it, but at long last, I've found an Indian restaurant that makes food I can actually eat!  For years Indian food has been a very rare treat I only indulge in when my Indian friends have been kind enough to make dinner or bring a dish to a potluck. In my experience restaurants have often made their Indian foods too spicy or too \"Americanized\" - not to mention used far too many fatty ingredients and oils that just made me sick.  So the fact that I could stuff my face at All India, without feeling sick and while being able to enjoy my food, makes me happier than I can even explain. I came here with a large group of friends for a celebration; throughout the evening our waiter was very kind and considerate. There were a few moments here and there where we'd find that we were unable to flag him down to get refills, and occasionally it would take a while to get something like an appetizer or even the checks from from. It was a little odd seeing as the place looked mostly empty aside from our large group, but then again, we were a very large group, so I'm honestly willing to let a few delays go, especially since the waiter really was very nice - he always confirmed just how spicy we wanted our dinners and was happy to answer any and all questions our large group had about the menu.  As for the food? I just...yum! I personally ordered the butter chicken - tender chicken cooked in a nut and tomato sauce and served with warm rice. Honestly eating that dish was heavenly. It was perfectly cooked, seasoned, was as spicy (well, not spicy) as I requested...I couldn't get enough of it! Words cannot describe how happy I was to eat something that good after my many negative experiences with Indian restaurant dishes. I had the chance to try some of my friends dishes and sides as well, so I can also promise that their yogurt is absolutely amazing (seriously, try something with the yogurt - you'll be glad you did!) as was one of the spinach-stuffed vegetarian options.  I really want to come back here to explore more on All India's menu. Thank you All India for the wonderful experience and meal - you'll see me again!",

It had the best of all the other Indian restaurants that I frequent and the Indian households which I impose myself on.  It's authentic, and a had a bit for everyone. Meat lovers, vegetable grazers, vegans... As a spice lover, this had it all, a perfect combination of burning my esophagus as it makes it's way to indigestion later and taste.   I'd want to describe the different dishes here but that would be pointless. It would be better to  go to the restaurant and take a look for yourself and confirm the crowd's opinion.",

Our server seemed pretty friendly at first until we were seated and then it all went down. I'm not sure if he was trying to friendly but it just came out to be simply rude.  We started off with some appetizers and being here for the first time - we asked for few more minutes to decide on the entree. Our server's response \"Hurry Up! Okay\" - not that we were taking that much time and I would probably understand if the place was packed which it wasn't.  The food here is good. The buffet supposedly a lot better but haven't had the chance to try yet. Given the service, I think the buffet is the way to go at this place.",

They scam you saying it's a dollar it's really like 20 cents, me and my friend did the math on it one day and that was the last time we went. They have a decent variety but I wouldn't put it in the top number of Indian restaurants, not even close. To name a few places that are much better is coriander's weekend buffet, and yak mahal on McKnight road. Their everyday lunch buffet is amazing. Way more variety and flavor in the food. Save your money and go to that place instead, which by the way offers more variety for a cheaper price. And their water is served in actual glasses and not ghandi era brass cups that make the water taste like batteries.",

I was so lucky that the best Indian buffet had just moved in across the street.  The selection totally trumps that of Tamarind which is also in the neighborhood.  While it might not be that much to look at from the outside, the ambience inside is rich, colorful, and clean.    This is definitely THE place for Indian buffet in Pittsburgh.  With all the different Indian buffets I've had in the past, I still see some unique dishes here.  I love that they have puri (puffy dough) as well as naan.  After lunch, you can grab some Indian cooking stuff at Bombay down the street.",

    "text": "So, I finally went to the actual physical location of All India, instead of ordering takeout.  So the parking situation... mild disaster.  Apparently there are more than just the three maybe four parking spaces at All India.  Where are these extra spaces you ask?  Indeed, I too asked because for the life of me I had no idea.  Apparently to the right side of the building there is an alley leading to a parking lot.  Unfortunately, this evening there was a car specifically parked blocking the entire alley/ hill thing.  Oh well.  I ended up \"making my own space\" in front of the restaurant as i was unable to appreciate any lined spaces.  (Don't worry I clarified inside that I wasn't taking a drivers spot and/or wouldn't be towed).   The waitress was a little off putting as I was completely ignored such that my dinner order almost wasnt even taken.  Then when my fellow dinner guests went to the buffet.. those remaining at the table were asked to repeat everyone elses orders while she WROTE THEM DOWN this time.... If i had known there would be a quiz about other peoples orders... I probably would have taken notes myself.  Also, this other random waiter kept coming to our table reasking for our orders  and likewise rolled up with the check before we could even try to order dessert.  Mildly rude...   On the other side,  I still stand by my previous review on the food.  It is amazing.  Lots of gluten free options.  The chicken kadai was on point this evening!   The decorations were pretty good as well.  Overall my in house experience is a low 2 star and the delivery experience is a 5 which averages to the above 3 star.",

It's not quite as good as it was when it first opened a few years ago...they used to have palak paneer at the buffet, and now it's only paneer-less creamed spinach, for example. Still tasty though, and I always leave quite content after eating here.  The flavors here aren't as strong as some other buffets I've been to. I wish it were spicier, but most dishes are still pretty flavorful, so it's ok. There are always many different chicken options - tikka masala, tandoori, regular curry, chili - and sometimes goat and fish. Lots of veggie options too - lentils, roasted potatoes and cauliflower, chickpeas, pakoras, etc. There are multiple carb options - both plain and garlic naan, a chickpea kind of flat bread, two kinds of rice. The usual kind of fare you find at Indian restaurants around here. There is a decent salad bar and dessert selection as well.  It's decently priced ($10 for the lunch buffet), and the waitress/waiter is usually very on top of water refills.  Lots of space and seating options, and a couple of TVs usually featuring Bollywood of Indian pop videos, make for a generally enjoyable eating environment.",

It would be awfully exhaustive to mention everything I tried, so I'm going to say that I was pleased with the food across the board and mention a few of my favorites.  I liked the vegetable pancakes. I spread the coconut chutney, the mango chutney, the mint sauce, and the harissa on pancakes. All of 'condiments' were good too. My favorite entree was the paneer with peas (I think it was called mattar paneer but I am not completely sure). Before leaving, make sure to pick up some masala chai. It has a well balanced taste.  The service was very attentive and accommodating. Our plates were quickly collected and our glasses were rarely empty.  All in all, I was very satisfied with my dinner here.",

The food looks like food at a typical buffet, like it's been sitting there for a bit, but there was a large selection of different dishes and everything tasted great. Plus, as a student, I was able to get $1 off of the lunch buffet. (Hey, every dollar counts!)  The second time I went, it was not very good. I would say avoid going towards the end of their lunch hours - you get left with old food because they don't bring anything new out when they're about to close. Sounds like common sense but we didn't think about it and it wasn't good.  Both times, we had one nice server and one guy who came around who wasn't nice. I would say the service leaves something to be desired. Also, the ambiance is a little depressing. They keep it quite dark (though the water goblets are wicked cool and look like something from Game of Thrones). My boyfriend, who's from India, thought he had found a place he could go to every week for some good Indian food, but I think we'll have to keep looking.",

    "text": "This place lingered in near obscurity when it first opened a few years back.  They stayed strong and were rewarded with one of the most consistently packed places in the area.  Maybe it's because they finally got rid of the silly limited buffet and went full time with it.  Indian food is a fickle creature for those of us who weren't raised on it.  It behooves us to try mostly everything.  Most people would agree that chicken tikka masala (the general tso's of indian food) is probably the most accessible, but why would you just get that?  If you only get tikka masala here, you're worse than those people you knew in high school who ordered the burger when it was all you can eat wings night (those people today are now in loveless marriages, AT BEST.  Most likely still living in their parents basement and being very indignant on social media as if their opinion means anything, to hell with them).  I guess the point of this drivel is this: GET THE BUFFET.  It is a smorgasbord of delicious flavors.  My personal favorite is their chicken chili and mushroom manchurian (the latter isn't always on there, but it is delightful).  For those of use with the eating disorder known as veganism, this makes me more empathetic to your misguided stance (for those of you morally righteous college students, veganism is the ULTIMATE privilege).  All of the vegan options here are rich and flavorful.  Wow..did I get personal there.  Anyways....  Naan is probably the current championship belt holder in the World Bread Federation.  Pita has made some strong strides, and Italy was reigning for so long (a la Bruno Samartino, thus capping off this brilliant analogy), but I think garlic naan wins and will hold the title for a long time.  All India's garlic naan is untouchable.  I love when they bring it out onto the buffet and you open up the tray, only to get a faceful of garlic steam, like vampire pepper spray, but since I'm human, I remain undeterred and dig in.  Naan also is basically an edible spoon, which sops up the delicious sauce soup (which doesn't sound delicious at all, but trust me, I have no reason to deceive you) that ends up on your plate.    All India is great...not high art...but when you have so many A's, you don't need a valedictorian (this sounds kind of profound, but the more I read into it, it makes zero sense, but for the integrity of the review, I must keep the stream of consciousness flowing).  The ever so slightest complaint though...the water service can be a little slow when they are backed up.  With all of the dishes they serve, you will inevitably get dry-mouthed.  But this is so small, I can't ding them a star.    IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  Bob Marley.  A great introduction for those of us not ingrained in the reggae music..it should be all you really need to appreciate it.",

As you can expect from a buffet, the quality of the food is not as good as if it were freshly prepared for you. The chicken tikka masala was dried out and the naan was a bit soggy due to being trapped in a steamed catering tray. However, I still enjoyed my meal very much.
