I stated I have ordered here 4 times before and they did that. The manager reported they should not have done so and they are not able to accommodate that request. So I told him to cancel the order. Since the customer service was that bad I would never order from here again. I walked 2 blocks and got a dozen bagels and two flavored cream cheeses for half the cost.",

I went on a straight binge of jimmy johns sandwiches  for like a week. So good..Mmmmmm! Miss that place...   The pickles are huge addicting also. They have a nice variety of sandwiches and you can order whatever you want on it or off it. They have soups too... But I never tried em. I stuck to the sandwiches because it was what they did best!!",

Most people don't realize that hairstylists don't take that lunch hour.....we're chowing down while mixing your haircolor on the fly. Hence, we NEED delivery. Not only does Jimmy Johns deliver, their bike-riding delivery drivers get your sandwich and skinny chips to you sometimes faster than you can collect the cash from your coworkers. It's amazing.       Their sandwiches are good, reliable, and can be made relatively healthy. The employees are really nice, and very patient and cool with annoying modifications to the sandwiches. They also have awesome dill pickles.",

The veg sandwich is tasty enough, I like that they have sprouts for the sandwiches, and that you can choose wheat bread instead of the traditional white sub. But there's only one thing I can order on the menu, and this girl likes options! Also, the only 'sides' you can choose from are huge pickles or chips, and I don't care for either. Again, lack of choices. I know it's a chain, and I know plenty of people that really like these sandwiches, I just wish they had more selection for the veg crowd.",

Also, the Vito and Italian Night Club are classic staples to get here! If you enjoy Salt and Vinegar chips these are the by far, the best that I've ever had.    I am sad to say the cleanliness of this franchise location is subpar, as 75 percent of the tables and floors weren't clean with only 3 people eating in-shop.

They have a surprising number of employees every single time I'm in the shop, no matter what time of day.

I have learned at this location, after they have made your sandwich, it's imperative to check to make sure that it has been created correctly.

Three slices of turkey, cheese, and vegetables that are so paper thin that you can almost see right through it. They even changed the lettuce from delicious leaf lettuce to cheap ass, rabbit food iceburg because it cost less yet they want $6 for a sandwich? Like give me a break. Seriously.....all bread and paper thin condiments. I feel as though I'm at Panda Express when they give you all rice and very minimal meat. Cheap cheap cheap! Go to Jersey Mikes instead. They cut the turkey fresh for you in front of you and they load it up really good. The taste is amazing as well. The only thing good about JJ is the bread. Big deal. When I go out to eat I want my monies worth. Not some cheap as owner that skimps on portions.",

    "text": "You can't go wrong with a sub from Jimmy Johns-perfect place for lunch. They deliver or a quick place to stop in and get your order.  One of the best secrets is the nine grain bread you can choose to get your sub on instead of the white roll. It is so tasty!  I always go for the beach club-turkery, provolone cheese, tomatoe, lettuce, and guacamole.  One of my favorite things about this place is the option to get guacamole on the sub.  I also highly recommend the vegggie sub-sprouts, cheese, tomatoe, cucumber and more gucamole! Their cookies which are huge (especially the chocolate chip) are delicious!",

    "text": "I found my first experience with the unwich to be a delightful treat.  I must eat gluten free so I am always wary of the ability of sandwich shops to meet my needs.  They did a wonderful job of keeping my unwich from cross-contamination and I loved every bite of the all veggie choice (sans avocado spread which couldn't be verified gluten free).  I did find it a bit odd that all of there deli meats had gluten but better safe than sorry.  If I had written this review yesterday I would have given 5 stars.  However, today I ordered the same unwich for dinner and was pretty disappointed by how wilted and even brown pieces of the lettuce holding the unwich together were.  I would expect crisp and fresh lettuce since the lettuce is a key player here.  All in all, I'd go back and keep my fingers crossed for fresher lettuce.",

    "text": "The few locations I've been to have been pretty consistent, and this one is no different. Their sandwiches are fast, cheap, and to the point. They have a ton of employees, so the food is passed down the assembly line in an efficient fashion. The menu, with all its creative monikers and such, really just comes down to choosing your vegetables and meat and finding the combination that you want (or customize it). No matter what you get, the subs are some of the best that you'll find in the area.",

I stopped by for lunch today and ordered a veggie sub, and my sandwich was ready before I walked to the end of the counter to get it!  And this was at 12 noon; they were pretty busy.  I am definitely a fan!",
