Crabcakes a bargain as an appetizer at $15 for a hockey puck sized cake that is mostly crab with little filler. far more interesting to eat at the bar than the dining room just to watch the atmosphere. Not cheap but the sat. night special of Prime rib was good nicely rare and beefy, nice place to go on a cold winter night when you don't want to run from car to door. And the crowds are always interesting at a casino.",

I would have to agree that our steak was overcooked.  I asked for medium and I definitely got something closer to well done.  Same for my brother seated next to me.  If the steak had not been overdone, this place would be a 4 for me.  I love the new casino and, when visiting Pittsburgh, this restaurant gives you a place to go that's festive.",

    "text": "My husband and I visited Pittsburgh for Xmas. We live in NYC but he's originally from a town 40 miles outside the city. We decided to stay downtown for the holiday. We were looking for a place to have Xmas eve dinner and since we planned on going to the casino anyway we decided to go to Andrew's. We're very glad we did! We had a late reservation and ended up having the place to ourselves...fabulous! I'm a jaded New Yorker..not easily impressed by alot of things but I liked the decor of this place. Floor to ceiling window and had a classy yet sexy ambience. Our waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable. My husband wasn't too hungry so he ordered the scallops. I believe if you're at a steakhouse, you MUST try the steak. Our waitress recommended the strip steak so I decided to go for it. I usually never order a steak on my own but I got the 20oz bone-in rib eye and SOOO glad I did! IT WAS THE BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD! I like my steak medium (no bloody meat for this chick!) Our waitress extraordinaire suggested I get it \"medium plus\". She said since it's bone-in, a medium might still leave some reddish parts which I do not want.  So again, I went with her suggestion. I got my big piece of rib eye and I couldn't be happier with it! The way they cooked it was perfect for me! A little charred on the outside but still medium and juicy on the inside! I also ordered a side of mashed potatoes but my steak was so good, I barely ate the mashed p. That was no doubt my favorite and best steak I've ever had! We're now back home in NYC and I still can't get over how good it was. We will def hit this place up everytime we're in Pittsburgh and I recommend it to everyone! Mmmm....soo good!",

Beautiful atmosphere, and there was only two other couples in the whole place...this on a Thurs night from five to six thirty. The server was so polite and attentive..it was awesome. We had the calamari and the onion soup..both yummy. The free bread basket was delicious!!!!! We both ordered the burgers..and they were huge!!!! We ended up with doggie bags. The food was out of this world. I would go back in a heartbeat. We skipped wine and dessert to save money, so the bill was sixty bucks for two. We drank water. All in all, totally worth it. I thought it was a bit chilly inside. That is my only complaint. You should try this Place it is great for a date, b day, or special event. Truly upscale. We were impressed. The chef even made us honey mustard and BBQ sauce from scratch for no charge. We like those with burgers. They aim to please and the fries were amazing too!!!! You will not regret it. They seem hungry for business and happy to serve you. The place was a bit fancy for kids. It was more for adults and dates, a business meeting may work well there too.",

    "text": "The lady and I went here last night kinda on a whim'.  We've been meaning to check out the new casino and figured on a Tuesday night it shoudn't be too busy and it wasn't.  We got there around 7 PM and pull up to the valet (which is complimentary with a players card-which is free), so I see no reason not to valet.  The entrance to the casino itself is quite grand especially for Pittsburgh.  I won't spend a lot of time describing the casino except to say the crowds were okay, probably a little better than mountaineer.  I was able to find a blackjack \"table\", which is with a video dealer, but I had just as much fun and won enough to pay for dinner x 2 in about 30 minutes and Annie found some nickel slots.  There are mulitiple restaurants from casual to fast food to their take on \"fine dining\".  We tried the \"fine dining\" option which was Andrews.  It's a very lovely place.  Inside there are high ceilings, ornate lighting, big bar with a friendly bartender and plenty of tables/booths.  However, what I really appreciated was the outdoor seating.  We were able to sit right on the railing on the sidewalk on  a gorgeous early fall night.  I like how the trim of the huge casino changes colors and during the early evening it was quite beautiful.  We were greeted quickly enough by our main server \"Bill\" who was working in conjunction with \"Joya\".  Overall they were pretty good and I've been told jobs here are a hot commodity, so chances are your server will be a professional.  We started with a couple drinks.  I had a dirty martini, ketel one, rocks...which was quite good, however Annie wasn't as lucky with a weak and sour vodka/tonic.  We started with a couple appetizers.  I ordered a half dozen oysters, which were surprisingly good.  I think you're typically not suppose to order oysters this time of year, but Bill said they were from Nova Scotia, so I guess it was alright.  They were plump, fresh and briny.  It was served with a pretty forgettable mignonette sauce and cocktail sauce.  We also tried the \"hot off the rock\" more of a novelty item than anything else.  It's servedon \"volcanic rock\" and you cook the meat yourself.  They serve it with a trio of sauces and it's tuna, beef, chicken and ahi tuna.  It was fine and kinda fun, but taste wise no better than anything you'd get at any hibachi around town.  They had a very nice selection of bread served warm with good quality butter and hawaiian rock salt (big fan of hawaiian rock salt, refer to tomatoe mozz review at the carlton).  The two person table was a bit small for this beginning, but we made do.  I guess I suggest if you want to order some of the bigger plated items like the hot rock and oysters, maybe have them serve one before the other.  Annie had the sirloin (12 oz.) with mashed potatoes.  The steak was a bit overcooked and the mashed potatoes were good, but not capital grille or ruth's good even though they were charging ruths' prices.  I had the King Crab which is technically considered with them an accompaniement, but at $40 that would be one hell of an add on.  THe portion itself was large enough and the crab was cooked well, and they did crack them for me.  However, when I spend $40 on \"king\" crab legs I expect monster crab legs these were closer the cheaper snow crab version.  I added on for $10 the trio of sides of which I picked the mushrroom fricassee (okay, but not flavorful), onions (forgettable) and au gratin (quite good).  Most of their  entrees are served with sides except steaks and certain seafood like lobster.  Overall I found the quality good, but not deserving the $200 including tip with two drinks each it cost me, not including dessert.  If I go back I'll try to go for the cheaper lunch or hopefully by then be getting 'comped'.  Again, not a bad place with good service but definitely not in the same atmosphere as Capital Grille or even Hyde Park.",

As we walked in, the Maitre D'  and two servers/bartenders stood at the Host Stand and simply stared at us when we walked in.    Realizing we wanted to sit at the bar, we made our over to the completely empty area and had a seat. After a few moments of staring at the empty bar, the Bartender finally walked over, looked at us and rudely said, \"what can I get you?\"  For starters, less of an attitude....this \"nice\" gentlemen by being rude, not welcoming us into the restaurant and not introducing himself, cost the establishment a very healthy check which Morton's was more than happy to accept.",

    "text": "Surprisingly a pleasant experience!   We're not really gamblers, but had dinner at Andrews to celebrate a family member's birthday.  We were pretty worried when we walked into the casino and nearly choked because of the cigarette smoke... for out of towners - Allegheny County no longer allows smoking in most restaurants and businesses, so this was quite a shock!  Once we got to the restaurant, all was well.  The decor is pleasing and not over done.  We were seated outside on the patio and had a decent  view of the river and city.   The meal and drinks were delicious... our table selected a round of cocktails and steak tartar and calamari for appetizers, both delicious and decent portions... then various salads (caprese was awesome!!) and finally main courses - 2 steaks with a trio of sides, ciopinno and the monkfish... ciopinno was great, slightly over cooked, but still really great flavor.  my husband's bone-in ribeye was of Flinstone's proportions and had great flavor.    I didn't get to check out the wine list, but both bottles of Northern California wines (Cab and Sauv Blanc) were great.  My only major criticism was the garbage carts were wheeled about 15 yards in front of our table every so often... there was no odor, but it was rather unsightly.  I know garbage needs to be dealt with, but wondering if there is a better path.    Overall, a great meal... total for a table of four (cocktails, apps, salads, meals and 2 bottles of wine) was about $550... so it was pricy, but delicious!",

First of all, the restaurant is beautiful. Very classy. The waiters, waitresses and bartenders were all very friendly and clean. I had the 14 oz New York Strip Medium and it was perfect. Everything is pretty much a la carte, so I had a baked potato and roasted mushrooms. It was great. My wife had Chilean Sea Bass and loved it as well.

    "text": "Was extremely pleased by this restaurant.   Went here for our anniversary and first night out since our daughter was born; to get a little steak/casino action. We sat on the patio, as the lighting on the inside lacked the usual ambience.   Service: Every person we interacted with was fantastic. Our waiter (Michael, ask for him!) was prompt, friendly, funny and knowledgeable about the menu. The sommelier was excellent and was able to recommend a mid-range wine we loved based on the hodgepodge of information we gave him about what we liked.  Food: Delectable. I had the 12oz. filet, oscar-topped with a side of asparagus. My husband had the 20oz. ribeye with creamed spinach and a baked potato. Unlike the other reviewers, we both marveled at the perfection of our steaks. A perfect medium rare, warm all the way through on both, with a nice sear on mine. Keep in mind: we are steak people, we've eaten at a lot of steakhouses and this was the most PERFECTLY cooked steak I've ever seen. Everything else was great, with the exception of the potato. Not that it was bad, just underwhelming after the quality of all the other dishes. But then, it was a baked potato.  The only negative point we had was the gelato. We really can't complain, as the dessert was complimentary (our anniversary), and exactly what we wanted (a little gelato, a little chocolate). However, gelato is not supposed to be hard. It's not like ice cream, it's a gooey, wonderful, weirdly-frozen mess. This was rock solid. I mean hard to get a spoon through solid.  All in all, we will be back. Probably too often. This place is the perfect high-end steakhouse to compliment a night of blissful gambling and drinking. It rivals many of the places we at in California & Vegas.",

    "text": "I was in the north side trying to find a spot to eat on a Sunday night which is a lot harder than I thought. Monterrey Pub and Legends were closed. Although I was in yoga pants and a hoodie we decided to go to Andrews.   It was 6pm but I was jonesin' for a bloody mary so I went for it! The bloody wasn't spicy but it still hit the spot. I might have had a couple more.    So I don't eat red meat or pork (yadda yadda bacon, yeah shut up) so I understand it's comical that I end up at a steakhouse.  Normally steakhouses have a wide variety of seafood as well Andrews fell short here.  Maybe 3 seafood dishes.   I had the spinach salad (hold the bacon dressing) which was good but too heavy on the balsamic dressing. The server then brought us 4 different kinds of bread with homemade butter. Delish.   I decided on the salmon which was cooked well. The vegetable/risotto mixture was blah. I didn't eat any of the concoction. My dad had the fillet with the trio of sides as well as a 1 lb mashed potato. He said everything is good (but he always says that). The server brought out a platter of topping for the potato which was a nice touch.   My dad got chocolate and pumpkin donuts with 3 different dipping sauces. I mean they were great but how can those be bad?  Pros: The server was very friendly and knowledge (although she made a joke about people ordering seafood in steakhouses, haha I can take it), tasty bloodys, warm variety of breads, decent steak (so says my dad), I didn't feel out of place in a hoodie but this is Pittsburgh (I'm not sure if that's a pro).   Cons: Limited menu especially with seafood (yeah I know its a steakhouse, shut up). Everything is a la carte which gets pricey and you end up with a pound of vegetables. I might sound like my grandma but it was really dark.  I had a hard time figuring out what my vegetables were.   Overall: This did end up being a pricey meal but it didn't knock my socks off. The high points were the bloody, bread and dessert (story of my life). I think I might stop in for a cocktail if I'm at the casino but skip the food.",

    "text": "Overall a very nice evening at Andrews.  We had a window seat with a nice view.  The waitress was attentive and knowledgable.   My wife had the Prix Fixe menu.  Her surf and turf was good.  She asked for well done filet and received medium, but she enjoyed it.  The Calamari was a bit salty for our tastes but still okay.  We had Caesar and Wedge salads and they were good.  My 12 oz Filet was supposed to be medium but was well done.  They might have mixed up our meat cooking requests.  My steak was still tasty but would have been better if cooked less time.  I was stuffed at this point and my wife received a creme brulee as a part of her menu choice.  She enjoyed it very much.  On my internet reservation I mentioned this was our Anniversary dinner.  This is where in kinda lost favor with the restaurant that night.  They surprised us with a piece of chocolate cake as an Anniversary congrats.  I did not ask for the cake and we were very please with the nice surprise/thoughtfulness.  The cake tasted very good.  Then we received the bill and noticed that we were charged $4 for the surprise piece of cake.  It's not about the money, but the idea that they were charging us for something we did not request, and something we thought was a nice thoughtful gesture.  I've been to many places over the years that have done something like this on anniversaries and birthdays and I don't ever remember being charged on the bill.  What if we were allergic to chocolate or something?  Would we still have to pay for this item we did not even order?   This put a bad taste in my mouth at the end of the meal.  We spent about $200 on the meal and they charged us $4 for the anniversary surprise piece of cake.  That seems very cheap to me, especially at the casino where I spend a good amount of time.  Overall, we will be back because we normally get very good meals here.  But, now we have a story to tell others and so far, we have received responses from people that are shocked that we had to pay for the cake.  Just odd is all.",

If you've left Ruth's Chris, Hyde Park or Morton's dissatisfied, as I have, you will enjoy this new \"best kept secret\" of Pittsburgh. I recommend the grilled hearts of romaine salad WITH anchovies (if you're daring!), the petite filet cooked or uncooked (I chose very rare) and the must have au gratin potatoes.  The drinks are a bit overpriced but that's something I can overlook when the food is as delicious as it is! The ambiance of the restaurant is quite enjoyable, the service is impeccable and the food is unbelievable. Yes, you will not pay \"Casino-cheap\" for this meal...but my philosophy is that you \"pay for what you get.\" If you truly enjoy a great steak dinner and don't mind paying when something is great, then Andrew's is the place for you!  Be sure to mention if it's a birthday celebration because your server will surprise your \"birthday guest\" with a lovely, complimentary, dessert complete with a candle and Happy Birthday message.  No worries though, there is no obnoxious gaggle of singing waiters or a sombrero for you to wear!   Andrews is truly a gem in the Steel City!",

    "text": "We've dined at this restaurant a few times before and we've never been impressed.  It's pretentious and way too expensive for the quality.  I have no problem paying high prices for worthy food, but this food just isn't worthy.    This time, we were seated as soon as we arrived, and we were able to sit outside.  It was a lovely evening, so this was a nice bonus.    Our waitress was incredibly slow.   She did not check on us enough and we had to flag her down for drink refills.  I asked her for a diet coke, and she didn't bring it.  I asked her a second time, and she acted like it was the first time I requested it, and it still took her ten minutes to bring it to me.  When I was in need of a refill, she was nowhere to be seen.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail appetizer, and this came out quickly and tasted pretty good.  $14 for six pieces of shrimp, however, is a little steep.    I ordered the soup of the day, which was a potato leek soup.  The waitress, however, brought me French onion.  I ordered a filet mignon, and requested it be cooked \"medium\" - the steak I received was well done.  The accompaniment I requested was a crab cake, and this tasted good, but neither the steak or the crab cake had any kind of sauce or condiment.  It was just a dry piece of steak and a dry crab cake sitting side by side with no sauces, no side dishes whatsoever.  Apparently, if I wanted a steak sauce or a sauce for the crab, I would have had to spend another $15 for a \"preparation.\"   If I wanted side dishes or a vegetable, I would have had to purchase these separately as well - and these sides vary from $5 to $12 extra.    Keep that in mind - if you order a steak, and don't specify that you want a particular sauce or preparation  (which you pay extra for), or if you don't specifically order the extra side dishes (which you pay extra for), you will get simply a piece of meat on a plate.    No soups or salads come with a meal.  Everything is a la carte, everything is extra.    I had every intention of ordering vegetables.  But the problem is, they serve nothing in season.  It's the middle of July.  The local produce is abundant in delicious vegetables and herbs of all sorts, but this menu is the same menu we saw back in January.  The salads had things like \"iceberg wedges\" and dried cranberries.  Where's the heirloom tomatoes?  The side dish vegetables were things like \"mixed root vegetables\".   I have nothing against root vegetables, but it's 90 degrees out for goodness sake.  I want something grilled, something light, something summery.  They're missing out on really wonderful opportunities to incorporate seasonal produce into their menu. None of the vegetables offered appealed to me, so I had a meal of meat.   My date ordered a hamburger.  This was the most pretentious crap I've ever seen.  The burger came on a giant, rock-hard bun.  The top bun was served upside-down with the lettuce and tomato on the top.  I wish I had taken a picture of this thing. We both just rolled our eyes when it hit our table.  Needless to say, the bun was inedible.  He had to take the meat off the bun and eat it with a knife and fork.  When the waitress came by to check on us, he told her that the bun was inedible and the whole presentation was just silly, and she agreed.  She said that everyone takes the meat off the bun, as she scooped up the bun from the table and scurried away.  If everyone has the same complaint, and everyone's bun completely goes to waste because it's too big, too hard, and too stupidly assembled, why are they still serving it that way?!!    The last time I ate here, I made the mistake of ordering the \"King Crab\" at \"Market Price\" - I received, literally, two crab legs - at a lovely market price of $60.  The crab was good, but I won't make the mistake or ordering that ever again.  It was so not worth the money.  Another problem - this restaurant is called Andrews' Steak and Seafood.    The word \"seafood\" is in the name of the restaurant.  But there are only four seafood entrees on the menu.  You can have salmon, pike, crab or lobster.  Crab and lobster are \"market price\" so I'd avoid ordering those.  So then you're left with salmon and pike.  Not a  lot of options for a \"seafood\" restaurant.  And the seafood that is on the menu is not labeled with an origin.  So, you have no idea if it's sustainably-sourced, and the waitress didn't seem educated on this either.   Despite the problems we had, we were not offered an apology or given an opportunity to speak to a manager.  When we were finished, the waitress brought dessert menus.  We were considering ordering, but after 15 minutes went by and the waitress never returned, we had had enough and decided to leave.  It still took us another 20 minutes to get the bill paid and get out the door.  As the \"nice\" restaurant at the casino, this place really better step it up.",

    "text": "Over-priced, bad service, and nasty food.  We went to dinner before the Pitt home opener (at Heinz Field).....Tilted Kilt would have been a better idea, seriously.  At least, Tilted Kilt doesn't bill/promote itself as something it is not.  Look - If we walk out w/ a $125 bill (2 people and no alcohol), it really needs to be spot on.  The steak wasn't memorable in any capacity (not even in presentation) and I am not convinced that the Chilean sea bass was really even fish.  Our waiter was an embarrassment to the service industry - he had less than four tables and was acting like he was in crisis the entire time.  The manager stopped by......but there was so much wrong, it wasn't worth discussing.  If you're looking for a good steak or just a fine-dining experience, try Capital Grille or Morton's (both downtown).   Or go to a real restaurant in a real casino.  I can honestly say I wouldn't eat here again, even if it were free.  It was simply a bad dining experience on every level.  I hate the casino, anyway.....this is just another reason I won't go ;-)",

Once we were seated the server promptly came over and greeted and asked us of we wanted drinks.  We went through the wine menu and ordered a Cab. When she came back which is seemed like twenty minutes because from what she said they had a hard time finding it. At least she was honest. Then it was the wrong year from what was printed on the menu. How does that happen? Then we had some questions about some things on the menu which she answered. We went for the tasting menu.  Great value! Fantastic scallops and French onion soup. Really liked the house salads even though I switched the dressing to ranch. We both ordered steaks which where cooked perfect and the sides thy came with it really filled us up. Then for dessert we had them box one to go and shared the chocolate cake. My wife loved the gelato that came with it.  Overall really liked the place.",

If you want to wait for the crowd to die down after the games, the restaurant is located in the Rivers Casino. Book the reservation in advance as they will naturally be busy right after the game!   The filet mignon tastes amazing but be prepared to dish out the big bucks  because although it's listed as an \"entree,\" it does not come with sides . The loaded baked potato we added was definitely a winner .  Overall, pretty cool atmosphere. It was a little chilly inside during our dinner date, but not unbearable. Check it out!",

    "text": "Let's take a minute to discuss wine etiquette. For instance once a wine glass is places on the table before you it should not be touched again by your waiter until it is removed. Also when you order a bottle of wine your server should always be the one to pore your glass. I have to say all of these rules were met perfectly tonight.   I showed up to Andrews hungry and ready for a good meal. They currently have a Valentine's menu and although I'm not a huge seafood fan I still ventured out of my comfort zone and tried their tasting menu.   The starting course was oysters. Yes to my friends who know my tastes I ate oysters tonight. They consisted of oysters on a half shell with horseradish, lavender and caviar. Not something I would try again.      The second course was an endive salad. It was interesting. I felt there was to much vinegar and the cheese was on the bottom of the plate so I was half way threw before I tasted it. The grape on the dish were carbonized which made for a neat pop of flavor.   The main course was steak and I really enjoyed it. My steak was a bit under cooked. I asked for medium and got rare/medium rare. The flavors were great though. I loved the parsnips and the sauce that accompanied the steak itself was heavenly.   Dessert was fun. I honestly cant tell you everything that was on the plate but if you see the pic the round white ball was orange flavored and I need a thousand of them.    This was a good meal. While not great I wouldn't mind coming back and the view of the river was nice as well. Service was perfect and with their extensive wine list I'm sure they have something to fit every pallet.",

We took our son and dil with us, out of the four meals two were good. My husbands med steak was barely cooked, they took it back and cooked it some More and it still was bleeding all over the plate. We waited until after our salads to get the bread.. when we first started going to Andrews they would scrape the crumbs from the table, the prices stayed the same but the service has gone so far down hill. Our waitress did an ok job but I was not in an ok job kind of place.. if you are paying top dollar you should get really good service and food. I had the crab cakes, they honestly were not worth eating. The best part of the meal was the cranberry bread, I am not a bread fan but I absolutely love the bread. We probably won't be going back for a while but we will try again at a later date in hopes that the food and service went back to the way it once was.",

The steakhouse is tastefully decorated and feels upscale like it should.  My favorite part of it is that the casino is kept in the casino and if you didn't walk through it to get here then you would never know that it is right outside the door.  So what that means is that restaurant seems to be somewhat soundproofed and was not smoky whatsoever.  Whenever my fiance and I came we both had the fall pre-fixe menu and I had the following:  Bread - Three types: jalapeno cheddar (my favorite), a rustic farmhouse type loaf and a fruit loaf all with salted butter.  Steak Tartar - This came with served with a baguette.  The tartar itself was bland and the raw onion in it was not for me but at least the sauce was good.  Beet salad - This salad had very sour dressing but I enjoyed it as it had goat cheese, blue cheese, white and red beets and pine nuts.  8 oz Filet - The filet was good by itself, cooked nicely and  I loved the salted top.  It  came with mushrooms that were cooked nice but salty and also a few overcooked pieces of asparagus and mashed potatoes which were nothing special.  Cheesecake to go - came with berries (blueberry, strawberry and raspberry) and some whipped cream and tasted decently.  The bottom line for me is that I would come back here again in the future.  It was another solid meal at Andrews and both my fiance and I enjoyed it.",

As we are avoiding carbs right now we had to say no to the bread basket, but it did smell delicious.   Overall our waiter was very nice and helpful. He was available when needed, but also gave us time to look over the menus and to eat without feeling rushed, or that it was taking too long.   The food was good. Definitely not the best steak I have ever had, but delicious none the less and overall a great time. Being in the casino is nice because we were able to enjoy some gaming after and it was all in one place.",

    "text": "Inside the Rivers Casino there are several restaurants, Andrew's Steakhouse being the 'High-End\" restaurant among them. We have been here oh, I'll just say numerous times, including fourth of July to eat and watch the fireworks.   How do you see the fireworks, well the backside of the restaurant is all floor to ceiling windows looking out over, across, up and down the river. Also there is a backside patio dining area under cover but with outstanding views including up the Mt. Washington hillside. In this warm months this is a very pleasant or even perhaps an outstanding al fresco dining scene.  So what do I like best here; the food and views. And the least, a bit noisy from the casino and intermittently slow service.  Our usual starting place would be the Bluepoint oysters on the half shell, which are always nicely presented and tasting fresh out of the water. They are accompanied by Cocktail sauce, Mignonette, and Horseradish sauce. Some of our other favorite starters are the French Onion Soup with Applejack Brandy, and Calamari which is served with Lemon Aioli and Arrabbiata sauce dipping which has a nice complexity and heat to it. The Calamari is delicious and very tender.  We alternate between the salads all of which are pretty good. I especially enjoy the beet salad. This has read and yellow roasted baby beets, with goat cheese, frisee and arugula and a Sherry vinegar reduction. These flavors all work together so nicely.  So far, we have not tried the seafood, chicken or burgers. But the Steaks, Prime rib and the Lamb are what we are drawn to.  The Bone In Ribeye done medium rare is just bursting with flavor and practically melts in your mouth. This is an outstanding steak, one which I come back for often. Linda loves the Rack of Lamb. This Lamb is mild, tender, beautifully prepared and very delicious for you lamb lovers. We have had Lamb all over the country and this stands up to the best we have had including Jamison Farms (actually from here in Latrobe, but served around the country in the best restaurants, and Elysian Fields (also local to Green county and served in around the United States). Example, Thomas Keller famed Chef of the French Laundry in California serves Pennsylvania Lamb.  One other item worthy of note, there is a very great bar in here with seating and several High-top tables. Overall this is a very good choice if you are seeking the high-end steakhouse kind of dinner and experience. I think the Ribeye here might be the best int he city.",

    "text": "So this is my 2nd here. My first experience was when the casino first opened and it was terrible. It was so bad that I wrote the manager. They offered to comp my return but I just never made it back.   This time around was a different experience.   We entered the casino and was immediate hit by the terrible smell of smoke. Why is the smoking section right in the front?   As a non-smoker this was a huge turnoff and we swiftly made our way as fast as possible to the entrance.   We were welcomed with a smile and awkwardly shown our table by the host. She was going to have her assistant take us to the table but the assistant had walked away but still was taking to her which was so weird. She apologized and took us to her table.   Our sever was good but lacked any sort of personality. She did the job but that's all.   I ordered the shrimp cocktail which had 4 huge shrimp. All were cooked well and was provided a nice portion of cocktail sauce.   My wife had the pear salad. This was the weirdest salad I have ever seen. The pear was pureed and then formed into a square. And the salad were micro greens. So I would say the description was not enough close to a pear salad.   I had the bone in ribeye which was delicious. The steak certainly filled the plate but that's all that was on it. I'm just not a fan of Alla cart style. It makes the plate look terrible and boring. My plate also just had the steak and nothing else. So bland!  The wife had the petite filet which was cooked well. But when you put a filet all alone on a big dinner plate it looks terrible! Come on put some mashed potatoes and jazz up the plate.   Now my mom had the rack of lamb which had roasted Brussel sprouts and a few other items. I'm so confused at this point in the meal. 3 of the 4 meals had only the steak on them. But one had a full beautifully crafted plate.   Sorry but forget to mention that we all had meat for dinner. My dad had the porterhouse which was huge.   While all the steaks were cooked properly. Plating gets a 0!  Due to the boring plates and smoke in the casino, prob won't be back again.",

After walking in she didn't make eye contact and left a long, intentional pause after asking us about reservations. 2 more seconds and we would have left w/ our $150.  Waitress: Stacey was amazing! She was attentive and super friendly.   Food: The chef refused to make my burger medium rare for some reason. It was medium so I sent it back, and when I got it back the 2nd time the chef sent a message that the burger can't be made medium rare. I'm sorry, but I've had plenty of burgers medium rare at other high end restaurants (see: Minetta Tavern in NYC). I only didn't send it back again b/c I didn't want my food tampered with. It tarnished an otherwise great food experience.  Verdict: With a better hostess and a chef that listens to customers this place would be 5 starts. Regardless, the burger was amazing, so go for that!",

Highlights, in no particular order:  * Salads: Fresh, delicious, enormous, creative. The winter salad features crusted sweet potato croquettes. Amazing! * Steaks: Top-notch. Bone-in ribeye is the best in the city. Filet is fantastic as well. This EASILY beats Ruth Chris. * Seafood tartare: Very creative, interesting use of sushi-grade seafood. Highly-recommend. * Service: Very knowledgeable & competent. * Drinks: Excellently executed! :) * Ambiance: Beautiful, well-curated space.  All in all, an excellent restaurant.

My husband and I visited Andrew's for an anniversary dinner. I ordered the City Chicken - which is hilarious when you think about it, considering that was a dish created for families on a tight budget, and is now being sold at a premium. No one makes better City Chicken than my mom, but I was in the mood, so I decided to give it a try. It was delish for sure, but I was violently ill afterwards. You never REALLY know what causes something like that, but I had all the classic signs of food poisoning, and it was AWFUL. Our server was also a bit...condescending, might be the word? Regardless, the venue is stunning, the menu is thoughtful and eclectic, but my experience was questionable at best.",

Crab cakes were mostly filler. Bread pudding was dry and seemed stale/old in the center. As if it was made days before and merely microwaved. Weird interaction with person who was the host-- I asked to be seated by the window and he refused, although there were plenty of empty tables tonight.   Would never, ever recommend nor would I return given menu prices. Note: this was a review I started to write a few months ago and forgot to return to.",

I started with the french onion soup which was really good not the best I have ever had but good. then onto house salad which had balsamic vinegar which was also very good.

Waiter was fast and friendly and very accommodating. I would definitely go here again. The prices where a bit high but if you like really good steak then you will have to pay. The only negative aspect of the restaurant is you have to go thru the casino to get to the restaurant and i am not a big fan of smoke and the casino reeked of smoke. But definitely do not let that be a deciding factor as the meal is definitely worth the trip.",

    "text": "We dined at Andrew's for the 4th of July. Pros: Excellent location to watch the fireworks that began on the barge below at 9:40 pm. Prime location, smoke-free, under air conditioning. You could still hear some of the music from your table. They have an excellent patio area if you prefer to sit outside for the show behind risers with additional seating. When the finale begins, you can walk outside for a terrific view!  Cons: The meal was very pricey for Casino dining and only so-so. The best dish was the Italian soup. The \"Caesar\"  salad, steak, and salmon all fell short. We were hoping the cheesecake would make up for the shortcomings but it was a lard-like block accompanied by stale chopped nuts and cough syrup like sauce.   Table service was friendly but sub-par. We ordered a bottle of wine. The first glass was poured. We had to pour our own glasses thereafter. Only one wine glass was brought for a table of two. My husband ended up pouring a glass of wine for me into my martini glass because the entire waitstaff was outside watching the fireworks.   Maybe this was due to second-string on deck for the holiday? Disappointing, given these weren't second-string prices. Hopefully others have a better experience.   As to be expected, the parking situation was chaotic. We parked on the roof-level of the garage. Again, excellent view of city lights. When the show ended at 10:00 pm we waited until 11:00 pm to head to the garage. Like others, we made the best of the delay because there was no way to exit the facility. We just turned off the engine, remained parked, and enjoyed the beautiful view. The lines of cars did not clear so top level could exit until 12:45 am!   In all, it's still a great place to visit for the holiday. Maybe just order a bottle of wine rather than meals and plan to take your time.",

For starters, they served bread. I think they gave us two different types of bread. It is fresh and tasty. We ordered crispy calamari and pan roast chicken.   Crispy calamari didnot taste anything special. It is like the one we get any restaurant served with two different dips and wedge of lime. Coming to the star of the dinner, the pan roast chicken. It is amazingly delicious. The nice cut of chicken has a subtle yet right amount of spice. It is soft, juicy and fresh. I highly recommend this dish.",

We walked right in and was seated immediately. The ambiance is nice and cozy. The lights were dim and we had a table where we could see out into the city, so the view was nice too! The hostess gave us both the regular menu and the restaurant week menu, which i was happy about.  For an appetizer, i got the charred endive salad. My friend got a scotch egg and beet salad (not on the restaurant week menu but i highly recommend trying it). For our entree, we both got the filet with polenta and mushrooms. And for dessert, we got the creme brulee. The presentation of the food was beautiful!  I am giving Andrew's 4 stars for a couple of reasons. First, our appetizers came out very quickly, but we waited a good while for our dinner to come out. Also, we both asked for our filets to be medium rare, but our steaks came out basically moo-ing. It was more rare as opposed to medium rare.  But overall, i would visit Andrew's again. The service was great and the food had good flavor.",

There was people in sweatpants, jeans, and dressy Valentine's Day outfit with heels. The service was good. My husband got the porterhouse medium rare and I got the crab stuffed twin lobster tails. Both were delicious.   If you're ok with walking through the smoke and noise of the casino, you'll definitely enjoy.",

    "text": "Came here with family for Winter Restaurant Week.  It is definitely a nice quiet spot to get away from all the noise of the casino.  The service was excellent and they had a nice selection available for Restaurant Week.  The table ordered the salmon tartare as an appetizer, it was spicy but very good.  And a good portion size compared to some fine-dining establishments.  From the Restaurant Week menu I ordered the spicy sausage scotch egg, filet with polenta, and chocolate mousse bombe.  The scotch egg was not very good.  It lacked flavor and there was no spice to it at all.  I ordered the filet medium-rare and it was done perfectly and tasted great. The polenta was delicious as well, and I usually am not a fan of it.  The chocolate mousse bombe hit the spot with extra sweetness.  Now I will say my husband ordered a dry-aged NY strip off the regular menu and I was surprised when I tried a few bites how tough his steak was, he had ordered medium-rare as well.  After we left he even said he debated sending it back to the kitchen but was so hungry he just wanted to eat and not cause a problem.  Andrew's was worth going to with the discount of Restaurant Week, but I don't think it's worth the money in general. I did appreciate the quiet so will definitely make a stop in here for a few drinks when I'm at the casino.",

    "text": "Wow what a hot mess  So many things went wrong  The bathroom toilet at the rear connection had a leak which soaked my skirt solidly   I took photos an immediately showed management   Hardly any apology and no offer to pay for my dry cleaning   My grapefruit margarita had an old lime garnish on it which I videotaped for YouTube  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FTcjtehe61O8&s=f5c3c7693d13b0f3f16055ab098e27dbcdeeb1185ab5a9a8dd41cac1cac5b677\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/Tcjtehe61O8</a>   Google youtube old lime garnish   Since we were  so sloppily treated I've made it live and included their name The manager said he'd comp the drink but at dinners end it was on the check   Beware you may pay $42 for an entree but yinzers will be serving you  Except for soup every item took forever to arrive   We had to ask 3 times for steak sauce   The waitress kept forgetting I asked the waitress about the The lobster bites , she said  they were Panko coated. But they came and were definitely not. The manager confirmed that. The baked potato was steamed starchy and yellowish instead of flaky white , the peel was brown and soggy  I sent it back but not before the manager defended his subpar product   From the look of things he'll eat anything   At the end we waited forever to be asked for desert and then the check  The baked potato wasn't removed from the bill and had to summon the manager yet again, but he wasn't apologetic   The filet came without the shaved egg accompaniment, but we were exhausted complaining about things   He wasn't apologetic at all. He was the heavy guy   He should have been embarrassed at the entire episode  We are well traveled foodies and gastronomic elites and too many things here disappointed  The soup salad and bread were good   We got the worst service ever and were their for hours   At the end the waitress was quick to remove the bread basket to \"make room for us\"   BULLSHIT , we waited over 45 minutes for her to remove it but she was in a hurry to close and take it back to the kitchen for cleaning   We left a 12% tip on the bill minus the tax of course which was very generous",

Not quite the quality of a Ruth Chris or Morton's, but overall a very good experience. Our waiter Gus was very attentive and informative. Great place to eat at the casino. Very quiet and relaxing atmosphere from all the chaos in the casino.",

My steak was as tender as it gets and tastes outstanding. The boursin mashed potatoes are my favorite side dish in the world. I also shared the parmesan mac with short rib and again, fantastic. Cannot say enough good things about this place.",

    "text": "Wow.  I wish that was sufficient enough of a review. It's really all that needs said.   Joshua and I found ourselves here after Yelp's night at The Nutcracker. We were seated quickly by Alex, the gracious hostess. Almost immediately after Alex wished us a good meal, Gus was at our table with water and all of the low down on the menu we could want. They had a T-Bone steak special with Havarti Potatoes and mixed vegetables, but Josh and I opted for items on the menu.  I got the Shellfish Linguini, and Josh the porterhouse. (Same as usual, King Friday) He also got the trio of sides. Whipped Mash, Mac & Cheese and Crispy Brussel Sprouts.   Let's stop for a second for a moment of silence for the Shellfish Linguini.   Wow.  I think I already said that. But wow.  It was perfect. Loads of lobster, shrimp, mussels, sea bass, and clams. Usually seafood pasta is a load of pasta and wimpy portions of seafood. This was a pleasant spin on the usual. It was so much food. Gus was right. I was torn between the Hangar Steak and this; just because of the Havarti Potatoes. Glad he pulled me in the right direction.   Joshua's porterhouse was a giant piece of meat. An amazing giant piece of meat. It was like meat butter. Melted in your mouth. I haven't had a bite of steak like that in a long time. (Thank you for sharing, potato.) The sides were sides, nothing to write home about. The flavors were there but they didn't really hold a candle to the rest of the meal.   All in all; I'm a fan. My pocketbook? Not so much. Is it worth it once in a while? Probably. But I've got bills to pay and a Dog to feed. Ya feel? Do yourself a favor, though, and take the third mortgage on the house and go once, at least.   Happy Eating!",
