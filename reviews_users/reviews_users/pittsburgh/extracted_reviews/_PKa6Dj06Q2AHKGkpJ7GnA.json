The ribs had a nice smoked flavor and were amazing paired with their sweet bbq sauce, the wings are bbq smoked style, which means soft texture, not deep fried crispy (pairs better with bbq sauce as well).  Mac and cheese was a nice hearty cheezy baked style, and the potato salad was top notch.  Ordered it to go and ate it in the hotel. I would order another meal and take it home to New Jersey, but they are sadly closed on Sundays. Regardless, eat there!",

We had a craving for some wings during a football game and decided to try this place out. At first glance, we were a little disappointed that the wings seemed to be smoked rather than the typical crispy buffalo hot wings. As soon as I took a bite, my mind changed instantly!   The meat was, as cliche as it sounds, falling off the bone and the flavor was amazing. You could put the wing in your mouth and pull all of the meat off by barely using your lips. The meat was smokey and juicy and we easily devoured the entire order.",

This was my 3rd time getting food here and every time I've been someone's complaining they are short staffed, they're acting overwhelmed and completely disorganized.   I called to place a large catering order for my company for July 4th and was told by the woman who handles it they were short staffed & busy asked me to call her back on her cell that night vrs taking my info, exchanging email, directing me to a website etc. This is a large catering order for a professional business and you're asking me to call your cell later that night?   Next I decided I'd stop by for dinner on my way home and called to order fried chicken, first the guy told me no orders over the phone. I told him okay & asked if they had some already cooked or do they make it when I get there? He put me on hold, I heard him talking to someone then he came back to the phone and told me to come in 15 minutes. When I got there I was told by the cook they didn't even have flour to make fried chicken & the guy does stuff like that all the time. If you have a kid working there who you're aware lies to customers why is he answering the phone? I would never go out of my way to go there again because of that. I tried to be a good sport about it, still ordered a meal and got a side of mac & cheese. Nothing was comp'd or discounted for the inconvenience and ironically the woman ringing me up gave me the wrong bbq sauce because she was distracted on the phone...literally taking a catering order!   Employees sleeping at tables, food containers laying around from employees eating at the register. Speaking as a Business Major they need to bring in somebody who knows how to run a business. It's sad to see the low employee moral as soon as you walk in and if they lost hundreds of dollars of business from me because of how disorganized they are that day I can't imagine how much money they must lose on a regular basis.",

Z-Best BBQ really lives up to it's name. Any meat dish will be fall-off-the-bone tender while the sweet potatoes and cabbage (my sides of choice) were both delicious and given in generous portions. The cornbread that comes with the meals... it was some of the stickiest, most delicious cornbread I've ever had the pleasure of eating! I honestly can't express with words how satisfying the meal was. For price versus value, this meal excels. If you're looking for a healthy place to grab a salad, definitely don't dine here. However, if you're looking for finger-licking good soul food, you've found the right place!  I'd recommend this place to anyone!",

Met a friend for an early dinner, and I already knew I would love it just from the windows being steamy, when I first arrived (that means the chef clearly was putting in work lols). I got pulled pork with the sweetest honey mustard glaze. You could definitely tell it was homemade. Along with the pork, I had sides of mac &cheese, greens, and cornbread. All in all a good fulfilling meal. Customer service was A-1. I shall return. :)",

They have street parking you have to pay for but easy to find a spot, at least during lunch time. I got the 1/4 chicken with bbq sauce. It was so good. Meat was tender and falling off the bone and the bbq sauce it was coated in was some of the best I have ever had. You get two sides with it and corn bread. Got sweet potatoes which were delicious and the Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was good but I've had better elsewhere so maybe next time, I would try a different side. Looking forward to coming back in the future!",

The chicken was perfect, smoky, moist, delicious. The sides also impressed me, the macaroni and cheese  was excellent with apparently a mix of several types of cheese, rich and flavorful, and the biggest surprise was the cabbage. I'm not a big fan of cabbage in general, but wow, you HAVE to try the cabbage here, sweet, delicate, buttery, and the perfect complement to bbq. Plus you don't have to feel as guilty eating ribs if you have some relatively healthy cabbage in the same meal! The negatives: Parking can be bad; you don't want to try during a Penguins game. And at off hour you might walk in to find the counter staff asleep in front of the TV.",

    "text": "It's getting harder for me to want to leave Pittsburgh, mostly it has to do with the food and people. Z Best  takes the cake as being the best soul food in Pittsburgh. We had plans today to go and check out this other place for soul food, but my friend was told about Z Best by her friend. After she just mentioned great mac & cheese we quickly changed our plans to go. Once again only street parking with a meters. That's fine because when you smell the food from across the street you know it's worth it. Going in we met the owner Darla, a native of Pittsburgh that knows her way around a kitchen. The place is family operated, so I complimented Darla on having her Granddaughter work there. Darla is teaching her granddaughter responsibility, most young people don't have that anymore. When she found out it was our first time in there and our first time to Pittsburgh she wanted us to know good south cooking away from home. Darla let us sample everything on the menu. Off the sampling alone I wanted to marry Darla, that way I could eat her cooking everyday. As advertised the mac & cheese is phenomenal. There are little words to describe it, but masterpiece comes to mind. The pulled pork is never something I do, it's not a favorite of mine, but tasting Darla's I had to get some and she put cheese on it. The Yams were also out of this world good. Before I couldn't sit down and get some, you see my brother and my friend destroyed them (mostly my friend). I couldn't believe food this good existed outside New York. On top of all Darla's generosity, she gave me corn bread free of charge, normally it comes with a meal, but I order everything separately. Darla wanted me to try all her food and see what soul food was all about. I'm pretty sure I convinced her to deliver to New York, what's 400 miles! Anyone who reads this bookmark it or better yet just go. Trust me you don't need directions, let that down south cooking aroma guide you.",
