    "text": "How can I not review the place that bears the same name as my Thai restaurant list?   I remember the first time I visited Thai Me Up. After a long day in the office I didn't really feel like going out out.. but needed some food. I'm usually always craving sushi or Thai. A coworker recommended Thai Me Up as some acceptable takeout and I anxiously called for some Pad Thai.   As soon as I head over to pick it up, it starts pouring. I mean like there was a tornado warning later that night pouring storm. I was half tempted to cancel my order and get delivery but I'm glad I didn't. By the time I arrive it's so bad that in the 40 seconds it took me to run in from across the street I was completely soaked. When I walked in, the establishment was close to empty and everyone stopped and stared at me like an awkward episode of a movie.  But it was so worth it. I'm usually the person that can handle cheap Chinese takeout but likes their Thai a little more upscale. This, however, was a True exception. Perfect heat and it tasted amazing. I've been back nearly every visit to PGH since.",

The food and service used to be fantastic! Today my experience was quite different. The waitress actually yelled at me for asking for hot sauce. (Mind you that I had ordered a number 10 spicy and there was no spice at all.) She spent 5 minutes yelling that I was taking up too much of her time and that she was too busy to deal with my table of one. Had she not been yelling she could have been doing the work she said she needed to be doing. When I went to pay my bill I let her know that she had offended me and that I didn't understand her anger towards me. I also explained that it was not my fault that she was the only waitress. I honestly wasn't trying to be a pain in the ass... She had no response and had no apologies. Regardless of how much I love their Thai Style Fried Rice I don't think I'll be returning for lunch or dinner again anytime soon due to their nasty wait staff.",

    "text": "Finding a moderately priced BYOB in the burgh was quite the task! In Philly BYOBs are everywhere!! (They even have an interactive BYOB map with closest Liquor Stores listed.)   Admittedly, I chose this place because of the prices and the BYOB option (corkage fees are a pain, this was a $3 charge per bottle of wine).   Like most BYOBs, this restaurant was small with maybe 7 tables.  The server politely told us the kitchen closed in 15 minutes (it was only 8:00pm, damn.)   I started off with the mushroom lemongrass soup, I wasn't a big fan but I tried something new and sometimes it doesn't always work out. I ate about half of the soup then my Spicy Shrimp Salad arrived.  The salad was great! The dressing was a spicy ginger concoction with about 6 pieces of shrimp intermingled. Yum!  My friend got a Pineapple Curry which wasn't spicy at all (she ordered a 9 on the spicy scale) and almost bland.  My other friends got Spicy Fried Rice, Chicken Satay and Chicken Curry which they all enjoyed!   Pros: CHEAP, BYOB, convenient location on carson, accept credit cards (so many byobs are cash only), CHEAP, decent food  Cons: closes early, corkage fee, spicy things aren't that spicy  Overall: Check it out if you want a byob with cheap food! If you are going out in Southside BYOBs are a great pre-game option haha...but seriously.",

On one occasion, the food was delicious and the service was OK until it was time to ask for the check. The waiter seemed to be avoiding my eye contact and ignored me flailing my hands around for his attention. My friend had to walk up to the counter and demand the check after the waiter ignored us for 10+ minutes. After we handed over our cards, he took forever to bring the check and cards back. We were trying to get to a movie at Southside Works after dinner and we ended up being more than 20 minutes late, not including previews, because it took 30 minutes to pay our bill! So ridiculous and disappointing after we had been totally satisfied with the food. The food is great, the decor is cute, and the atmosphere is cozy, but the service is such a huge issue that I am not sure I'll ever make a fourth trip back.",

Wanting some comfort food and being stuck on the South Side, I had my mind set on some spicy basil noodles which are just as basic to make as pad thai. It's the other Thai dish that's really hard to mess up. Or so I thought.  After being seated and served water by a really weird waiter I waited for him to come back and take my order. Although I was one of two occupied tables in the place, it took him a while to get back to me. When my food came out it looked alright, despite missing the aforementioned basil. In fact, I found only a few shreds of basil amongst the very watery and bland sauce. The only thing I could taste was salt. No delicious chilis, no fresh veggies, no hearty noodles. It was like eating coagulated salt water. Gross. The only saving grace is that the chicken was definitely real, white meat chicken.  I would highly recommend skipping this place unless you are literally starving and can't walk another inch down Carson St.",

Wonton soup Steamed dumplings with tamarind sauce Thai-me-up wings Basil leaves with beef {piquancy 6/10} Green curry with beef {piquancy 8/10} Spicy fried rice with chicken  I must say, I still enjoyed the wonton soup.  It still had the aromatic notes about it and I enjoyed the flavor.  The steamed dumplings were much better this time; in fact, I rather enjoyed them.  They were no longer rubbery and everything that was so out of balance the first time was finally in balance -- even with the tamarind sauce.  I upped my entree to an 8/10 on the piquancy since last time it was lacking that flavor that I enjoy.  I was banned from trying anyone elses food since they were not willing to try mine.  I was told by my friends that their food was good.  The only note of discontent I heard was that my friend that ordered the Basil Leaf with Beef would order the chicken in the future since it had better flavor.  My green curry was wonderful.  All of the spices melded together and I felt that the beef was perfect due to the strength of the sauce.  I can already crave that sauce again and will most definitely be returning.",

VERY RUDE I thought given that he didn't come over to our table to seat us prior to bringing the water so how should I have told him? Next, when he brings the water and ask if we are ready to order my friend says she needs a few more minutes. As he is turning around I say excuse me, trying to order an appetizer. He walks off saying he will come later. VERY DISINTERESTED, I think. I find another and ask for straws and she politely brings them over. Then for the finale my entree, Pad Thai is sweet beyond belief and has no vegetables. After trying to eat I call him over and he claims that this is how they make it and the chef has followed the receipt since he was watching over and walks off. I have had Pad Thai at Thai Me Up before and this is not how it tastes or looks. Second, he was running tasks in front of me so he could not have overseen the chef cooking. Bottom line: very very very bad customer service.",

Although I believe first time may be Spice Island. Irregardless...  I was uneasy considering a lot of my friends had only rated it three stars. But the thing is, I was pleasantly surprised! Their lunch menu is super simple. One sheet with about 15ish dishes all for $6.95 AND you get soup or an egg roll (they call it spring roll, but I always consider spring rolls not fried, and this definitely hit the fryer).   I've been branching out more in my Thai adventures, so I went with the Green Curry. All along I was thinking I'm not a fan of curry when, turns out, I'm a BIG fan of curry! I'd go so bold as to say I love it now! You know why, because it was delicious here and I love coconut anything.   You may not get a lot in that small pot, but at the end, you're satisfied. I had large veggies like broccoli and beans with shrimp I added in. Around 4 or 5 shrimp did the job, as well as a bowl of rice on the side. I loved everything about it. The sauce was creamy and coconut-ty, with just the right spice (around a 4, I'd say. I'm a lightweight).   What a deal, right? I'm so excited to go back. Especially considering my friends meal, the spicy noodles with tofu, was also incredibly flavorful and delicious. You've definitely won me over Thai Me Up... I'm just sad it took me so long to come back!",

I specifically note that I want the dish to be a 10/10 spicy, or \"Thai hot,\" and they follow through and deliver really solid, spicy Thai noodles. They even sell their spice at the register. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but it seems different than other Thai restaurants (I regularly also have gone to Pusadee's Garden and Nicky's Thai Kitchen in Pittsburgh, and Thai Me Up has better spice). Something about this spice really leaves the dish with the right amount of zesty spice.   Occasionally the Pad Thai is a little oily or sauce-heavy, but the vast majority of the time, it's really tasty and done just right.   As far as ambience and convenience goes, I wish that they had Wi-Fi, as I tend to come here for lunch. It's also a much better lunch place than a date or dinner place. It's a little too casual, IMO.   Definitely a fan though!",

I usually find it to be a bad sign when a Thai restaurant finds a way to mess up Pad Thai, but this is what happened. The dish was colorless, served with no garnish and the flavor was bland.  The service was wonderful though, our water glasses were consistently refilled and our food was served within minutes of ordering (which, looking back, should have been a red flag).

What shocked me more was that I had to ask for extra spice. Like I said there should be a spicy rating for foods that are labeled as such.

As far as the food, I think it is just average. The prices are reasonable and they have a rather large menu to choose from, but it's not a place that I would really have a strong desire to return to. However, it is a place I would go to and hangout with friends if we were grabbing a casual lunch in the neighborhood.",

Or bathe in drunken noodles every night...  I will start by saying there is nothing wrong with the service here. Our waitress was very attentive and prompt. And after we let the owner know how dissatisfied we were, she gave a us a full refund.  But consider yourself warned - the food is a GIGANTIC rip off and an extreme disappointment. I cannot stress this enough.  If you like spicy, then you'd better order a LVL 10 to get what is equivalent to a LVL 3. Also there were absolutely no garnishes or vegetables in the Pad Thai whatsoever - no peanuts, limes, bean sprouts, egg, green onions - nothing. Just wet, under-spiced, over-sweet noodles and tofu for $11 dollars. Luckily (because I always ask for extra vegetables) I got a *few* in my Pad Kee Mao. We didn't even finish our food because we were so disappointed. $25 for noodles with practically no flavor or spice.  Skip this place and to Nicky's Thai on Penn. Or go get the $3 Pad Thai from the cart in the strip. Both light years better than Thai Me Up.",

My dinner at Thai Me up was some of the best Thai food I have ever had (and I eat lots of Thai food in cities all around the country), the service is fantastic, and the environment really relaxing and fun.    Their menu has plenty of standards, but also some food I have never seen elsewhere.  I had an eggplant salad with chicken tomatoes and hardboiled eggs.  It sounds like an odd combo but tasted like heaven.  It might be my new craving food.  I ordered Z-U noodles, which is the same as pad see ew.  It was the best I have ever had.  It was saucy instead of dry, and the sauce was so incredibly flavorful.  Huge portions too and a really great price.  Usually I'm not the type who gets caught up in the decor of a place; I care mostly about the food.  But it is always a plus when an affordable place steps up the decor and can make a date night feel that is easy on the wallet.  The lighting in this places is great.  I'd have the owner come decorate my house if I could.",

The space is essentially a garage with cool rustic finishes. It's a bright, pleasant little place.  They do a lunch menu with smaller portions but still plenty of options. Each entree comes with either lemongrass mushroom soup or a spring roll (or both for an extra dollar). My friend and I couldn't choose, so we opted for both. The soup was served very hot and was a nice starter. The little spring roll was also good, but it didn't really stand out from other spring rolls I've had in the past.  I ordered chicken in garlic sauce (which also had broccoli, carrots, and greens) served with white rice. I have ordered this dish from other places in the past, and have found that it is usually packed with flavor--unfortunately this time I found it to be pretty bland. The portion was generous (despite being the smaller lunch size), but I just felt like it was missing something.    We're lucky to have a bunch of Thai options in the city, but I'm not convinced about this place yet. A lot of people seem to love it, so I might need to try again and choose something with a little more spice.",

I ordered the spicy Thai fried rice but with Thai basil added (kind of like a cross between the spicy basil noodles and the spicy fried rice) and they happily catered to my off-menu request.  Also ordered a massaman curry with chicken.  The service was very friendly, and the takeout came out in 10 minutes, which is on the fast end of my takeout experiences.  The guy behind the counter was also very kind to let me hang out inside the restaurant, at a corner table, even after I received my takeout, so that I wouldn't have to wait for my boyfriend outside in the cold!  The food itself, though, turned out to be pretty mediocre.  The basil fried rice was fine, but it didn't hold a candle to Thai Cuisine's spicy basil rice (my favorite in the city).  The flavors were not very complex and it was a tad on the salty side.  The massaman curry was better, probably better than Thai Cuisine's, and it was a good spice level.  But nothing to write home about -- Pusadee's is much better, and since we live so much closer, I doubt I'll ever trek out to the south side just to seek out the food here.  I do admit that I like the punniness of the restaurant's name, though!",

I think this was the worst pad thai I've had in the past five years. It was very bland. It lacked the texture and flavor spark that I've experienced at Thai restaurants in San Francisco or Berkeley, CA. Even in Pittsburgh, you can get better pad thai at Noodlehead, Bangkok Balcony, or Silk Elephant, for example. My friend's entree, eggplant with basil, was better (3 stars).  Contrary to some other information I'm seeing here on Yelp, Thai Me Up takes reservations. At least they did for our party of 5 on a Thursday. (On the phone they told me they don't take reservations for Fridays or Saturdays, however).  Service was slow. After we finished eating, it was 20 minutes before the waiter came to ask if we were ready for the check.",

We frequent Nicky's, Noodlehead, and various others in our neighborhood. Thinking this place would be pretty cool we headed over. They greeted us, sat us. Waited about 15 minutes for anyone to come to us to take any type of order. Let me mention, there were only 2 people, but we were first sat before the 3 other tables that came in. Finally someone came over, we ordered vegan Thai iced tea, cup was filled with ice, maybe 3/4 of cup of actual tea for 3.50. Waited another 15, trying to get the attention of one of the servers. We ordered the fried mushrooms, Thai me up rolls and a red curry. Before we could tell them a spice level he went away.  The mushrooms were literally drizzlings of tempura batter. The mushrooms has disintegrated from the hot oil I imagine. No flavor or taste besides fried batter.  Their signature Thai me up rolls which were noted to be with mint and basil-ended up being completely soggy, not a tight nor fresh spring roll. Stuffed with vermicelli and iceberg lettuce and a tiny piece of basil. 30 minutes iN, still no curry or someone to refill waters or clear plates.  They brought out the red curry took the plates and we didn't talk to them again until the check. It was an extremely light pink color, almost white with almost no broth. We just asked for veggies-definitely frozen carrots, bamboo shoots  and broccoli. Zero spice, zero flavor. Absolutely not Thai food. Tasted like straight up coconut milk. Of course, both servers were able to straight up ignore us but not come over to see how the meal was. It was taking so long, so I tried to eat it and had another bite. They kept looking at us, ignoring us, refilling every other table with waters etc. (were both servers, so we understand how service should be given) Finally, after 25 minutes of waiting, we asked kindly if maybe we didn't get the right dish, or it was seasoned properly/unfinished, asked if we could maybe exchange for something else, she took it away, they brought the check. We took it up to the counter, proceeded to explain our disappointment, that we still offered to try something else. He was exceptionally rude and stated, 'The vegetables dilute flavor, it's why it's watery'. Thanks for admitting your curry is watery. And that logic also makes no sense. He finally said he'll take off the curry to that which we never come back. Absolutely unprofessional, kind and NOT Thai food. We tried to be kind and gentle because we get how working in a restaurant can be, and we're treated horribly. After we walked out, he literally came out the door and said 'Never come back, K, thanks bye'. Worst 'thai' restaurant in Pittsburgh.",

The Green Curry; Once again, sweet. How do you make a Green Curry too sweet? I don't know, but Thai Me Up sure does.   And finally, the Fried Rice. This was literally just rice, and roughly a dozen strips of Green Pepper.   Thai Me Up sells the \"Authentic Thai\" experience. Unfortunately it does not deliver. My wife and I have both traveled throughout Thailand numerous times, and Thai Me Up comes nowhere close to being Authentic.",

The staff was very nice and even though they were closing in 20 minutes, they welcomed us and never rushed us out (although we didn't linger...). Promptly offered to open my wine, which was in a bag and not 100% visible. Fantastic...and only a $3 cork fee.   We ordered the fried spring rolls for an appetizer and they came out piping hot. Light, not too greasy, and quite delicious. For our entrees we ordered the Spicy Basil Noodles with Chicken and the Red Curry with Tofu.   It was a bit confusing that I wasn't asked about my heat preference for the Spicy Basil Noodles, but perhaps those aren't typically spiced? So, the dish had zero heat level, but was still excellent. The chicken was sized nicely (no impossible to eat chunks). I would have liked to have seen a bit more napa in the dish, but otherwise everything was well balanced. Huge portion--I took half the dish home for lunch and it was even better chilled. The sauce is slightly sweet, but with a nice garlic flavor.   The red curry was excellent. Creamy, nice heat and flavor. Plus, the vegetables were not cooked to the point of sogginess. Nice crunch to them!   I look forward to visiting again and trying some of the chef's favorites...I'll just need to start carrying wine with me so that I am prepared for impromptu stops here for dinner ;)",

Wonton tacos are a good appetizer but eat them fast or they get rather soggy.  Lemongrass and Coconut Galangal soup are great for a cold day.   I tend to think it is a little overpriced for the quality but overall it's a tasty place for your mouth region.",

I found this one on Yelp on a whim, and it happened to be super close to home, but I never knew about it. I love the coziness of the decor in here, and the staff is pretty friendly. I ordered the pumpkin curry, which is seasonal. It was amazing! It had a nice level of saltiness for the spice, and the spice level was accurate to what I requested. It was the perfect portion of curry and rice, and I left just satisfied enough. I was dying to try their desserts, but was too full for it. I highly recommend this place for dinner any night, or for a cozy, casual date!",

The lemongrass and wonton soups are to die for. The pad Thai is very good. On my last visit I had zu noodles which were excellent, and my bride to be had the basil eggplant. Her dish was incredible. The eggplant was cooked to perfection and with the basil flavor as a wonderful complement on your pallet, I already decided on what I'm getting next time. Its BYOB, so you definitely will save money if you like a glass of wine or a cold brew with dinner. Most of all why I love this place, is what other top 25 restaurant in Pittsburgh can a couple go to and each of you get a soup and entree and only spend $30! I highly recommend this joint",

The level of spiciness is usually on point with what you order, but sometimes a 6 can be pretty hot for me! But the food is still delicious. It is BYOB which is really nice!

A friend took me here and I throughly enjoyed the ambiance, rustic, antique, with young hip diners and an authentic menu and attentive staff.

The spring rolls were also great, but who can get those wrong. This location is great to pop into and is super casual.

    "text": "We visited this restaurant before heading on to see Snow White & the Huntsman at South Side Works. We wanted some place cheap and different from our usual steak/burgers/etc. fare.  Thai Me Up (what a stupid name) is small and there isn't much in the way of decor, but none of that really matters as it is also cheap eats. Altogether we had the lemon grass soup, a spring roll, pad thai and green curry with chicken and tofu and a side of steamed white rice.  My rice was soggy on the bottom, which is disturbing when I'm eating out. I can't cook rice to save my life, but, considering it should be rather simple and easy to prepare, it's a little scary when a restaurant can't get it right. The green curry was delicious, but my absolute favorite was the spring roll. This is surprising for me as I hate spring rolls, but the dipping sauce was amazingly good!  The lemongrass soup was also quite tasty and very different from any other soup I've had before. My boyfriend's pad thai was pretty good, though we've both had better elsewhere (can't really complain for the price, though).  I'm only giving Thai Me Up 3 stars because, although the food was tasty, it left you wanting something more flavor-wise. Some of the items were threatening to veer into the bland side of the specturm. Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park was much more appealing, but the location leaves a lot to be desired. I recommend it for better thai food, but if you're looking to hang out in the south side and people watch or go out later, Thai Me Up is the perfect place for some quick, cheap eats.",

However, I thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Thai Me Up.  It is a smaller simple restaurant, but delivers with food and service. We brought a bottle of wine with us, which was immediately opened for us ($3 fee for the BYOB). For an appetizer, we shared an order of steamed dumplings. Very good, and the dipping sauce complimented them nicely. As for an entree, I went with the Z-U noodles (called pad see ew or sober noodles in other Thai restaurants I've been to). The dish was cooked very well, but I wish it would have been spicier. I enjoy spice, but was a little tentative since all Thai restaurants are a little different. The spice scale here is on a scale of 1 to 10 (I'm used to mild, medium, hot, and Thai hot). I went with a 5 thinking it would be comparable to hot, however should have ordered a 7 or 8. The server nicely brought out extra spice in case I needed to make it hotter.  We had a great meal and will definitely return.",

I was never at the old location but the current location is a pretty good spot.  I've probably been there about once a month over the last year.    The Good: - The ambiance and decor are very cool.  There are garage doors that they can open on warm days that are a nice touch.  They also have an old-fashioned cash register that is a nice antique. - It's a very clean, relaxed environment. - The staff are always really friendly and the service (eat in and take out) are very quick and efficient. - The lunch combos are pretty reasonable - $7.25 for a nice selection of different dishes. - The lunch combos come with a spring roll and a dipping sauce that are excellent.  The Not-So-Good: - The food quality is not consistent.  I tried different dishes the first few times I was there (Spicy Basil was a great start!) and eventually tried the pad thai.  The first time I had the pad thai it was very good.  Great flavor, just enough sauce and a good portion size.  The next time I had it the noodles were really soupy and very fishy (waaay too much fish sauce).  The last 2 times the noodles have been pretty dry with almost no sauce, which meant there was not a lot of flavor. - I got take out from there today (dry pad thai) during my lunch break at work and got sick less than 2 hours later, with subsequent trips to the bathroom at 15 and 20 minute intervals.  Overall, it is a decent place to go - a cool environment with hit-or-miss food, however I will be avoiding for a while after getting sick from eating there today.",

He said that while a few of their dishes are egg and dairy free, they use fish sauce in everything on the menu - and they do not make dishes without it because it isn't authentic.  I asked if there was anything on the menu that didn't have fish sauce in it and he said that they could probably make the fried rice without fish sauce, but they definitely put oyster sauce in it.  He then told me that oyster sauce doesn't have any actual oyster extract in it so I can eat it.  Oyster sauce does have oyster extract, among other things that make up the sauce.    Very disappointed that the waiter was so unaware and unwilling to accommodate.  Menu should be clear that Thai Me Up's version of vegetarian actually includes fish or other seafood.",

First I'd like to mention how much I love the venue. The \"garage-door\" style windows make you feel like you are sitting outside when they are open, which is great. The decor is also very nice. This is a very Americanized Thai restaurant in that the menu caters to people who are not super adventurous or are new to eating Thai food, but there are still plenty of options and it is relatively inexpensive (and BYOB!). The food was pretty good and while it is not my favorite Thai restaurant in town, I'm sure the convenience of the location will keep me coming back pretty regularly.",

But so fast that I'm pretty sure everything is sitting in hot pans in the back until someone orders it - nice people - cheap .. but for good reason.  Moving on.    If you have any level of sophistication in taste for Thai food (or any Asian food), just stay away.  This \"Thai\" food is pretty much on par with the asian place in the mall food court.  Maybe a little worse.   I think I would probably even prefer asian food from the freezer aisle at the grocery store.  If you want Thai food, there are plenty of great options in the city.  Give your business to Pusadee's Garden, Smiling Banana Leaf or Thai Suan Thip.  You'll get something much better than low quality chicken and vegetables drowned in mystery sauce (that I'm pretty sure is 80% oil).    I hate to be so tough, but it was extremely annoying to get such a sub-par meal after hearing good things about this place.  Don't get me wrong, if you don't know anything about Asian food, you probably won't think it's too bad.  But if you know good Asian food, then definitely skip this place.  Don't say no one warned you!",

It is basically large noodles, meat and spice with some fried egg.  It is decent but still doesn't beat my regular joint.  If you are in the area and want Thai it is ok but I would probably try other places before coming back.",

    "text": "This Thai restaurant greeted me with French songs, how romantically irrelevant. Maybe they're going for a more \"date night\" feel. With such a humorously kinky name, it's a shame that the restaurant is tucked away towards the inner streets of Southside, instead of along the main Carson stretch. If it wasn't for Yelp, I don't think I'll ever discover this place. The restaurant is clean and bright with good service.    As for food, I thought it was pretty average. I ordered the Pineapple Curry Bowl, which is more on the sweeter side of the curry spectrum. It was creamy, soupy and slightly tangy. For a curry bowl, I was not satisfied with the spice level. Kind of disappointed that the waitress did not give me the option to alter that. My eating companions ordered two different noodle dishes, but they both ended up tasting exactly the same, just different noodles. The food took forever to come out, but ended up a bit too cold for my liking. I like my food steamy if I have to wait that long. Portions are average and can easily be finished in one sitting. Prices are double digits $$, but not too bad. I think it's a great place for a date night if you bring your own booze.   Overall, I thought the food at Thai Me Up was just okay, not the best ever. I feel like it's more of a fusion restaurant so I would recommend this place to my fellow foodies who are a bit more shy. If you're adventurous with thrill seeking taste buds, I don't think this place will satisfy that wild side.",

Portions are large, prices are fair, soups and sauces are not overly salted or sugary and meat seems to be high quality (you get regular shrimp and not those dinky ones and chicken breast instead of chicken parts). They are very quick and offer great seasonal items, like the delicious pumpkin curry and mango coconut sticky rice. They are willing to accommodate special requests and don't put up a fuss about it (steamed veggies and meat), sub broccoli for bean sprouts...that sort of thing. I usually get takeout, but I know it's BYOB for dine-in. All in all, my favorite Thai place in town. My personal favorites are the Thai chicken noodle soup, pumpkin curry, pineapple curry and cashew chicken with extra chicken.",

They had some New Orleans-y music playing. There are lunch specials that consist of a main dish & lemongrass soup for $8 . The soup was decent/good. Not on the level of Nicky's or My Thai or Thai Spoon(the 3 best Thai joints in Pgh. area, imo.) The pad thai chicken was rather lackluster with no peanuts, very little spice heat when I asked for \"Thai hot\" spice level. It was too sugary sweet, as well. Not enough sweet/sour/savory balance as proper pad thai should be. I will go back and try the cashew beef & other dishes but to me, Thai Me Up is a mediocre Thai eatery that doesn't seem interested in competing with the aforementioned better quality Thai joints because I think, being in a College off-campus housing area for the most part, they get a lot of 20 somethings that don't know any better.",

I came here with my boyfriend on a Tuesday night and it was literally empty except for 1 other table. The restaurant decor is so cute and has a very romantic atmosphere. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere with just a laundromat and residential houses surrounding it.  We ordered the crab Rangoon appetizer based on other yelp suggestions and it was pretty good but you could taste the 70/30 cream cheese to crab filling ratio. For the main course I got the spicy basil noodles with chicken also based on other Yelp reviews which I would give 1/10 stars. It was very plain and dry overall--the chicken, noodles, and bok Choy. I didn't taste any basil and it wasn't spicy at all.  My boyfriend got the red curry which was actually pretty good so I ended up just mixing my meal with the red curry sauce which gave it a lot more flavor.  It was still a very cute place and the service was fast and friendly but if you come here go for the curries over the noodles.",

The first two times were \"meh.\" Both the satay chicken and enoki mushroom appetizers were unmemorable, as were my first two dishes.  During the most recent visit, my boyfriend ordered the Z-U noodles - they ran out of the noodles for that dish and they had to be substituted. Okay, no problem, I understand restaurants run out of things. But then my Pad Thai came out (I wish I would have read all of the poor reviews about the Pad Thai before ordering), but I could not have anticipated it to be so terrible. I took two bites and was finished. It was a giant lump of overly sweet noodles with a few pieces of rubbery, flavorless chicken mixed in. I wish I was exaggerating. I ended up paying for it, taking it home and throwing it away because I didn't have the heart to tell our (very sweet) waitress that I had no interest in taking another bite.  With so many other options in the South Side, I don't think I'll be back.",

We went out for Thai food and, I'm not sure why, this wasn't even on our radar initially. We walked in and were immediately greeted, handed menus, and told to sit wherever. Water was brought over immediately and drink orders were taken. The waitress/hostess/Jill of all trades that was working was so friendly and bubbly, she seemed genuinely glad there were customers, rather than other places where the staff can be kind of...blah. We ordered crab rangoon, chicken gyoza(the special of the week,) pad thai, and spicy basil noodles (which I found out is what is usually called drunken noodles elsewhere.) Everything was cooked perfectly and amazing. The spice level could have been a little more, but that is on us, because we didn't know what to expect so we didn't get it overly so the first visit. (When we reheated it, though, it was a lot spicier and still delicious!) Give this place a try, it was great and we will definitely be back.",

Pittsburgh has a lot of Thai restaurants & most of them are very good but Thai Me Up I think is the best. They always deliver; excellent food no matter what you order, reasonable prices, great service & atmosphere.  My favorite are the wonton tacos appetizer. Delicious tilapia in fresh crispy house made taco shells with cilantro & a little bit of sriracha sauce. Amazing!! I wish they made them a little bigger as an entree. I could eat those as my whole meal.  The vegetable spring rolls are also delicious. Crispy but not greasy & comes with a semi-sweet dipping sauce.  I've had quite a few of the noodle & rice dishes, all are very good! My favorite entree is the pineapple fried rice with vegetables. Absolutely delicious!! Love the combination of the pineapple with the cashews. Also just the right amount of sauce, they never over do it.  I highly recommend Thai Me Up! They won't disappoint. And make sure you try the wonton tacos!! :)",

The sauce was not a typical peanut sauce or hoisin-based sauce that I've come across in Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh.

Pad thai: I have a strong sweet tooth and like the noodles to be chewy, and this delivered exactly that. The noodles were a bit too chewy, and I really had to use my incisors (front teeth, chomping down and sawing) to break the noodles..or I could have asked for a knife. The sauce was not as savory or salty as I would've liked. Overall, I thought this was a delicious noodle dish but not really what I would expect pad thai to be.  Mint beef salad: Insanely delicious! Although the presentation was not memorable, the flavor was spot on! Beef was cooked incredibly well, very juicy, well-seasoned, and flavorful. The mint was also very pronounced and really enhanced the overall salad.  Plenty of street parking after 6PM, ambiance is casual and nice for a date. Overall food was very tasty, but it wasn't exactly what I'd expect as Thai food.",

We stopped in early for the lunch special and I'm happy we did! On entering we where greeted seating was fast as there was no heavy lunch rush. We settled on the steamed dumplings for a appetizer and they where packed with flavor. We all got the padthai dish with different spicy levels. The only thing my friend changed was he got glass noodles in his for a extra charge. I got a level 6 and sometimes I can be a baby with super spicy stuff but it was the perfect build up. Another one got 8 and my Thai buddy got a 10. I must say we all crushed the food and we where the perfect fullness. The guy server walking around was so funny and checked in on us often. It was a overall good experience the food was hot and flavorful. I'm happy we came here and so was my friend as always I'll definitely continue to return here.",

    "text": "This place is located close to me and not being in the mood to cook take out it was. Now let me clarify I get Thai probably twice a year so I don't try it from various places monthly but my review I feel will stick close to my past experiences with Thai establishments.  I went with the spicy basil noodles which were ok but far from spicy. I would put them around 2 out of 10 spicy wise. The beef was good and all around it was an A-OK dish but left me wanting some more kick behind it and flavor. That rush of spice and warmness from a hot Thai dish you normally get.  We decided to do a side of rice which was ok but the place would not allow us to get a side of beef to go with it. I understand rules are rules but I found it kind of odd they couldn't just throw in a little container like most establishments a container of beef to eat with the rice. I don't really want to ding them on the review but honestly I mean on a take out level let's leave this up to the future visitors to think it's ok or not ok to deny a side of beef with a side of rice.  The location is easy to find there is some public parking a block down and street parking is possible. The interior is cozy inside and customer service was fine I can't say anything but positive in this aspect just in the future I will try a few other places in the city to see how they stack up against Thai Me Up with food taste wise and that damn side of beef lol.  3 out of 5 all day long nothing less nothing more.",

The Cashew Nut is also very good, nothing special as far as taste, so I highly recommend getting the Pad Thai. First time I came here it was just 2 of us and we were given excellent service. We sat right away, they took or orders in a timely manner and brought our food out quickly. When I came here with a large group of 8 people, while the staff was still friendly, they seemed unorganized. We asked to be seated 2 times (there were plenty of open tables) before finally being sat and they forgot to put one of our orders in, so my friend had to wait longer to get her food. Thankfully, they offered to split our check by meal if we brought the receipt up front, which we found very helpful. Overall, I  enjoyed coming here to eat and my meal was great, it was just slightly disorganized.",

It must be under new ownership as the most recent time I was there was negative. The food was okay, typical Thai food and nothing special. The best part about the old restaurant was the friendliness of the staff. I had come then several times a week and got to know the son and family. Now it is mainly business and very little friendliness.   In fact, I witnessed a waiter here go after another customer that didn't leave a tip and he followed them outside of the restaurant requesting that they leave a tip. While of course you need to leave a tip, I thought this was unprofessional. Maybe their service was lousy so they justified it, I am not sure, but it was unusual for them to follow a customer.",

I'm into adaptive reuse and delicious hole-in-the-wall restaurants hidden in neighborhoods.   Anyways, we ordered a few plates of crab rangoons and the wonton tacos and it was all very good.

Their lemongrass mushroom soup that accompanies lunch specials is nice as well. I've gotten a lot of consistently good meals here.  The atmosphere is a few notches up from other local thai spots, with lots of aged wood, plants, and local art in every corner. The staff is always lovely and welcoming, and the asian market next door (Sweet Panda) that shares the same owners is great as well. Definitely check this place out next time you're looking to grab a bite in the South Side!",

I was so mad and got up and went up to the register to pay the bill. I was trying to talk to the waitress and she would not listen and was saying that i hurt the people of Thailand. The owner at the register asked us not to come to the restaurant which we would not anyway after all this bullshit.",

    "text": "I love Thai food, and so when I was in Pitt, I got on Yelp to find a Thai restaurant in the South Side, and found this place.  Of course, I was intrigued by the name alone!  I went here for lunch with a friend who lives in town but had not been.  I took the advice a previous reviewer and ordered the Spicy Basil Noodles with my lunch special -- which, I might add, is a total steal: soup or spring roll and entree for under $8.  I was somewhat disappointed given the high expectations from the review.  I found the basil flavors lacking, and thought the dish was generally too greasy, the kind of greasy I expect from your neighborhood Chinese take-out place.  I tried my friends' Pad Thai though and it was definitely very good.  I've had better, but for the price, this place is definitely worth it.",

Once I discovered Thai Suan Thip and the Dancing Crab I kind of forgot about this place. I stopped here last night for the first time in a while because both of those places were closed.  I will say this is no longer my favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh, however I still have a strong love for this restaurant. It's the first Thai food I have ever tried, and it made me fall in love with Thai flavors.   Their crab rangoon is my personal favorite in the area. I eat an entire order myself with zero shame, and my friends all do the same. I can't really name a favorite dish, but their fried rice dishes and noodle dishes are good. I ordered something new last night (chicken pineapple basil) and it was tasty. They nailed the spice level, but I wish it was a little sweeter.   Overall, this is a solid Thai restaurant. Prices are reasonable, service is quick, and the food is pretty delicious.",

    "text": "Solely about their fried rice dishes - extremely sparse with their meat, egg, and veggies. Very good spicy basil fried rice - spicy enough if you ask for it, oily, a bit sweet, very soft, always hot.   99.5% rice. Their chicken meat resembles shrunken dried red chili peppers; thin, mangled-looking wiggles a couple rice grains long. Their red pepper is cut thinner than I have encountered anywhere; hairpins of slices. There are usually five or ten scraps of each. Egg is similarly very difficult to find. perhaps 1/10th of an egg gets into a dish that is about 4 cups of volume.  Extremely irritating part: I recently went in out of an unknown logic connecting my desire for thai to this place again. I was wise and wary of their pure-rice bowl. I inquired about additional meat and was pleasantly surprised, initially - for an extra dollar, they will add extra meat. I sprung for this option.   What I received was exactly the same pure-rice dish that I ordered a few times last year.   Good if you want only spicy basil fried rice. If you want spicy basil fried rice with meat, egg and peppers in it, like I do when I order basil fried rice, you will be disappointed.",

This most recent time I ventured down the back streets of the south side, to this little hole in the wall was last week with a long time friend. We came in at about 8 pm which seemed to be the rush ( you can see it in a servers eyes) so it took a little while to get a seat, no more than 15 minutes. once seated, we were greeted by a very nice(very flustered) server, who took our app order, crab rangoon. it took a little while to come out but once it did it was very tasty, and our server took our order once it arrived. We both ordered the salmon curry, the way the server spoke about it, it seemed as though we couldn't order anything else.  After about 15-20 minutes our food came out ( a little on the slow side again) and when I tell you this was the best curry I've ever had, I truly mean that. the curry had this sweet/buttery taste while the salmon literally melted in my mouth the mix was perfect, and even though I usually get a new plate when I go, next time ill reorder this for sure!  So in all the meal was great and ill never stop coming here, but if you are on a time crunch I would opt for taking out maybe (depending on the time). the whole meal start to finish was roughly an hour and some change.",

My mom actually suggested to go here and sometimes she's not the greatest at picking out places but she wanted to try it, so we did.   It's on one of the side streets of South Side which, I think, offers better parking. Or at least parking where you don't have to walk far. The inside is really cute and seemed pretty clean. The moment you walk in, you're greeted with smiling faces and that's something I find makes the dining experience a lot better. All of their employees were really friendly and attentive. Our drinks were always full and they checked on us the right amount of times.   We ordered the chef recommended Thai Spice Sausages. It was excellent. Definitely really spicy but very tasty. I would've gotten two ordered had I known how tasty it was! Probably my favorite thing we had.   My mom ordered the Basil Eggplant dish that came with sticky rice and I ordered the chef's recommended Nam Tok which was grilled short rib chuck with challots, cilantro, mint and roasted rice. Both dishes were full of flavor. You could taste every single spice on my dish. I loved the roasted rice, as well. It went so well with the sauce for mine and was different than your normal sticky rice.  And whatever sauce was in the eggplant dish was delicious! The only \"negative\" thing I could say is that I wish there was more on my plate! They covered the rest of my plate with some kind of salad greens. But the eggplant dish was a big portio. We also brought take home for my dad and he loved it, which is a hard palette to please.   I would definitely go here again!",

We decided to eat before we shop (always a good idea). Thai Me Up was on our way. What a really great location first of all. The building was very interesting. They have big garage doors we were hoping they would open, but they didn't.  Service was very good and certainly quick.  We ordered two curry dishes (green Thai spaghetti and red curry with chicken). Delicious. We could have gone up a bit on the spice (ordered 3 and 4). We also order two appetizers (summer roll and fried tofu). Perfect!  They have Thai iced tea, but the other tea is in a can-very good, but not brewed there. We will definitely go back. Can't believe they have been there for 4 years and we are just now learning about it.",

I recently ordered the crab ragoons and sweet and sour chicken with a Thai iced tea. Everything was very tasty! The portions were large enough for me to take home for lunch the next day. While it's not the cheapest Thai place I've been in Pittsburgh, I think the prices are fair especially if you take leftovers home. I will definitely return to try out more of the menu!",

    "text": "I've been to Thai Me Up twice and, if this was based on only my last trip it would be a 5 star. However, the first time was a 3 star so here we are.   Pros: -Decent menu -Fresh ingredients -Tastes more authentic than similar places -Big portions (though, my boyfriend noted his curry was small) -Pineapple fried rice is TO DIE FOR. I got it with shrimp and literally crave it. -It is BYOB so that's a plus, though we've never done it before.  -Prices aren't too bad. -Attached to an oriental market.  Cons: -Pad thai is SUPER nutty. If that's your thing, this is good for you. -If you're used to buffet style crab Rangoon's you may not like them here. They're definitely homemade and have a different taste. I love them so this isn't really a con, but I could see how it could be for others. -Not as spicy as I want. I got a 3/5 spice level thinking it would still be pretty hot and it wasn't hot at all. I love spicy so if you don't again, you'll be fine. I'll probably try to get a 5 next time (though I'm worried it'll be too hot then). -Service is meh. We waited a long time before anyone came to see us in an empty restaurant both times.  I don't like really curry and I tried some of my boyfriends and LOVED IT. AGAIN, Pineapple fried rice is THE BEST. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Our friends got a chicken noodle bowl (not sure what) and they both loved it and told us this week they're still thinking about it and want to go back solely to eat that. I'm in!",

The sauce is a bit pale red and not the traditional red curry that I am used to, but still good. My friend had the Pad Thai and it was one of the best I have had. Service and experience in this visit was good.   Second visit was with multiple friends and I had the Vietnamese Pho. I love Pho and I was disappointed. The noodles were not what I'm used to eating and the flavors weren't developed fully. All of my friends liked their dishes and I tried some of their fried rice and it had a great flavor. My friend got the Thai chicken and it was good, but filled with little bones that made it annoying to pick through. Service was slow, but acceptable.   I would go back, but I want to try the numerous other Asian places first.",

There is enough food to take some home for lunch the next day so it may seem a little costly but it's worth it!  Very nice wait staff and it is BYOB. They close the kitchen by 9pm (not typical for a SouthSide Restaurant) so make sure you get in before that. The new location is much larger than the old place on Carson Street and they have roll up garage doors that makes it very nice when the weather is, well...good or bad; they can have open air dining (or not).",

    "text": "Has Thai Me Up gone downhill? I've been to TMU a few times over the last couple years and I always thought that for the price, the food was very good. My last trip to TMU, I was not as impressed.  We called and made reservations for a Thursday night. A friend of mine arrived first and ordered the TMU rolls. When the rest of our party arrived, we waited over 15 minutes for the server to come over to the table and take our order. My friend also still didn't receive his rolls. We ended up ordering a few more appetizers and they all came out together. The appetizers were fine, (satay chicken, dumplings) no complaints there. However, I was not impressed with my dinner. Feeling adventurous, (I usually stick to a rice dish with chicken) I decided to try the Pho. When our entrees arrived, my Pho was presented in a bowl with a large amount of broth. It wasn't very pleasing to the eye as the broth was clear and the noodles and sprouts were white. My biggest criticism though is the amount of beef in the Pho. I would expect to see only a few bites of beef if this were an appetizer but not an entree. The dish was mainly vermicelli and sprouts which would have been much better if the broth it was in had more flavor. I could not taste the garlic or the beef in the broth. Well, I couldn't taste much of anything in the broth. I added some sweet chili paste to spice it up a notch but even with the paste the flavor was very one dimensional. My dinning companions were equally unimpressed with their meals with the exception of the chicken pineapple which had large chunks of chicken and great flavors. If I do go back to TMU, I will know not to stray from my standard chicken and rice dishes.",

I would say this is my favorite thai place in the city!  The place is usually run by only one or two servers as the floor is not that big, which gives it a great feel.  Sometimes it does get busy but the staff is always very friendly.  I would say rude customers get agitated but the staffs attitude about it always keeps me patient!  I love this place and it definitely deserves 4 stars for the food with an extra one for the staff!!!!  I can't wait to go back and keep working through their menu!",

My roommate had the z u noodles, and they were really good too. They were wide noodles, almost like a papperdelle and they held the sauce perfectly.

The food is great for the price and offers a variety that doesn't make you feel like you are just eating first class Chinese.  I highly recommend any of their curry dishes- try a 10 if you are into breaking a sweat over your dinner!  The only draw back of this place, and this is as of late, is that it is small.  You have to wait for a table and they tend to shuffle through customers on a busy friday or saturday night.  Weekdays go anytime, Weekends go early (before 6) or late (after 830)- either way - just go!",

The service is friendly and fast, my boyfriend and I were seated right away, and our orders were taken in a timely manner. It's a small place towards the end of Carson street, a little bit away from the bar hustle. The inside is on the smaller side, it reminded me of the restaurants in NYC I used to go too. It's quaint but because of this I wouldn't recommend if you had more than four people.   It's great food, cheap prices, and fast service.",

The highlight of the meal was the crab rangoons which were delicious. My husband ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp & chicken and I ordered the chicken with basil & pineapple. His was ok, not much flavor but decent. Mine was really bad. The sauce was tasty, but the chicken was horrible. It was overlooked and so tough I could not cut it with my fork (we had no knives.). I tried two bites and couldn't get over the texture. The waitress never returned to check on us so we eventually just flagged her down for our check, paid our bill and left.  I wanted to love this place. I did enjoy the decor/ambience but the food was disappointing. Not likely I will return.",

I also ordered the Salmon Salad; a bed of iceberg topped with a few pieces of slightly overdone salmon.  My crew of seven ordered a variety of soups, pad thai and fried rices.  All seemed a-ok.  The atmosphere is lovely and it's BYOB (with a few corkage charges, etc - no biggie).  Reservations are pretty necessary; at least for a Saturday night.  I recommend trying it out. It's cheap enough that if you're not totally in love with the place, you haven't lost much.  Plus - it's a nice, healthy option before you go gorge yourself on beer (and eventually Southside Steaks) on the glorious Southside :-)",

When I have dined in, they have had issues with being understaffed, one server clearly overwhelmed with an unusually busy Tuesday night, but as for the food, I've tried many dishes and they are delicious.  Standouts, their steamed dumplings are my favorite appetizer, done so well. their lemongrass soup with mushrooms is fantastic (lots of shrooms,) and if you ask for it to be spicy, spicy you will receive.   As for entrees, some of my favorites are the Spicy Sweet and Sour, with chicken and Tofu, both proteins are always prepared perfectly, and the S&S sauce is great... Eggplant and Basil with spicy ginger sauce, and the old Thai stand by, Pad Thai is certainly on par with Nicky's.",

The dining room was busy with one server who I have to assume was Sir Ben Kingsley, not only by his stunning resemblance but by his overwhelming pretentiousness that I have to think comes along with being knighted.   Anyways, the server was extremely rude as I ordered for myself instead of letting my sister go first.  I was planning on ordering for her and asking questions about the menu, as she has never had Thai food and is often very shy when it comes to these situations.  He cut me off, made some snarky remark about letting women go first, then turned his back on me and took her order.  She didn't know what she wanted because I never got the chance to ask the server questions so she just picked something.  I also never got the opportunity to tell him I wanted my dish spicey, so neither of us enjoyed our meals.  When our check was brought, he made another smart ass remark about me ordering first.  I have never been treated so rudely before by someone in the restaurant industry, and I don't plan on returning to be treated like shit again.   The soup was good tho.  If you like good soup and also some clown acting like he's better than you while serving you food, then this is the spot!",

    "text": "Given that this is the closest Thai place to me, I have reluctantly gone a few times. Always felt like I was getting hardly anything for my money, but today was definitely the last time I will ever order food from here. I ordered the red curry that I have gotten three other times for takeout. For some reason this time I received what can only be called the \"snack portion\" of rice and a container half the size I usually get for the curry itself. I understand raising prices, I don't, however, think you should raise prices while you simultaneously  cut the portions in half.  In terms of taste/quality of the food, the place is decent, at best. Nothing special. Try somewhere else with better food and more reasonable prices if you're looking for Thai.",

The tofu was very good, not over fried. The dressing delicious. The lettuce is just iceberg. Would want something a little different, more substantial.",

    "text": "Out of all of the Thai places in Pittsburgh, this one is the worst.  I know, that sounds rude, but it's how I feel, and I eat Thai in Pittsburgh, and in other cities very, very often.  Thai is my favorite type of cuisine, especially Thai Curry.    Their curry is rich with fish sauce flavor, and that's not a good thing.  You shouldn't be able to taste the fish sauce in a good curry.  Their noodle dishes like their Spicy Basil Noodles or their Pineapple Chicken are all right if you are hungry and stuck in the South Side (most decent restaurants are not nearby, and I live up the hill).  The problem with their noodle dishes is that they are too greasy.    They are typically nice here, yet not as attentive and friendly as I'm used to at Thai restaurants.  It's basically, \"hello, what would you like to eat, and then the check\".  My husband refuses to eat here anymore, so I trek over to Thai Cuisine or Zaw's instead.",

    "text": "The food was mediocre and I've definitely had better. I got the Pad Thai and it was watered down liquid on top of noodles. Very bland. Could barely taste the \"sauce\" and there was nothing else besides noodles in it! You can make better version by buying a frozen Pad Thai in the grocery store.  Parking is atrocious (obviously- it's the South Side).   The thing that bothered me about the restaurant was I went there with a group of friends before the dinner rush. The dining room was empty and we were told to sit anywhere. The 3 of us took a nice table set for 4 in front of the windows. At the end of the meal, as he was taking our tips/credit cards, the waiter berates us and tells us to never take a table for 4 again or he'll make us move. The dining room was still empty.  Go somewhere else - not worth the time.",

The staff were friendly and prompt for the most part, and I could tell that this is a place mostly frequented of locals. We ordered the Thai chicken wings and two meals. The wings were a bit greasy and did not compare to a place that serves them here in Tampa stuffed with seasonings and water chestnuts - delicious. The taste of our meals was decent, but I was a little bit disappointed in the portion size. Overall, eating here was a positive experience, but I would be open to other options for Thai in the area.",

The food is always deliscious, and the one time I did have a problem with the food not being spicy enough the owner was extremely helpful. He suggested that when I order I say that I want a 9 thai style because they make it american due to too many people complaining. The tofu red curry is my go to, and the spring rolls with peanut sauce are to die for! BYOB!!!",

    "text": "Thai Me Up is my most revered and favorite eatery to go to. I've taken many friends here and they have fallen in love with it in the same way. Located in an upcycled garage in the South Side, the atmosphere is creative and colorful, with super nice people running the place. I would believe I am considered a regular, and I am always greeted with a very warm hello and they are familiar with my usual order. It's always nice to have a jovial talk your waiter in such a casual place. The environment is always good-vibes, and they even open the garage door for refreshing air when it's nice out. I usually always order the green curry - spiciest level - because it is so darn good! Absolutely one of my favorite dishes ever. I recently tried their seasonal special, pumpkin curry, and I must say it was insanely rad! Creamy, spiced and salted with Thai flavors, and a bit sweet with the pumpkin. I'm a sucker for curries. Many of my friends who I have taken to Thai Me Up order the pineapple fried rice - a dish I have never tried, but is an absolute favorite among my friends. The Thai Iced coffee is delicious - be careful, you might drink it too fast it's so good! I also ordered the mango and sweet rice once which was very fun for a sweet snack - delicious; perfect for anyone who loves mangoes. The Z noodles and Pad Thai are very good as well. I definitely recommend the curries - I can't get enough of them! Thai Me Up will forever be a favorite. Thank you so much to all the kind souls running such a great restaurant!",
