On top of all of this, the salad I had was pretty bad. We never received an apology from the waitress or anything for the amount of time we were there. I will never return to this restaurant!",

First off I felt like we had gone back in time to a high school dance! All of the waitresses were paying more time chatting about the boy working in the kitchen then checking on their guests! Second we ordered the homemade chips and salsa! Let me tell you the chips were definitely from a bag or they were old! Their was nothing homemade about them! And last but not least we normally visit this place for their delicious wings but they were far from delicious this time! The wings were not cooked all the way and were missing the sauces! After it took 20 minutes to get our waitresses attention, we decided to get them to go and ended up cooking them ourselves at home! Poor experience will also share this with family who visits frequently!",

Great varied menu from unusual and interesting appetizers, tons of sandwiches! which is what we wanted for an early dinner. All done in interesting combos of breads, and unique touches.  My hubby got his all time go-to Philly Steak, loaded with steak, onion, peppers, cheese on a nice Torpedo roll, not your standard huge dry Hoagie bun.  I got the Roast beef, served on Twisted Rye, nice quality beef, lots of cheddar, I skipped the red peppers and horseradish and it was still fantastic. They came with home made chips, awesome, not greasy, and I up dreaded to sweet potato fries $2 - excellent, sprinkled with cinnamon! Huge portion!   This will be our standard place to eat now in that area!",

    "text": "This grille truly defines the phrase \"hidden gem!\" We stumbled upon this place after going to a local pow wow and couldn't be happier with the service, food, and look of Gator's Grille! We ordered the alligator bites appetizer in buffalo sauce, which was absolutely wonderful! The alligator meat was chewy, but it was unique and very good tasting, definitely worth the $10! We also ordered nacho mama nachos which were fresh tasting, although I would not order them again because they were bland and didn't have much toppings. The drinks come out in mason type jars, which is such a cute, fun touch! The booths are tall and the dining area wasn't busy so I felt like I really had privacy even though the bar in the other room was filled! I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza (4 large cuts for $9) & it was great! It tasted more like a gourmet buffalo chicken flat bread! The chicken was quality meat, and they put just the right amount of ingredients on it to make it a perfect blend of ranch, buffalo sauce, cheese, crust, seasonings and chicken! We waited a little longer for our food (20-25 min), but it let's you know they are making everything fresh! The bathrooms aren't the cleanest and there were some files buzzing around, which was annoying, but I give this place 5 stars even with that being said because the service is great, the food is unique and is reasonably priced for the amount they give you! The alligator theme is fun and the inside is really cute! Can't wait to go again and try their Oktoberfest beers and meals!",

I wish we lived a little closer because we'd always be ordering food for takeout or eating inside. It is only about 20 min. from Pittsburgh. First off, the place is really cute, to me it felt like it was a restaurant you'd go to while on vacation at a beach. The whole place obviously revolves around alligators and there's a bunch of decorations that are alligators. The place is very clean and the booths are spacious, the bathrooms weren't spotless but most public bathrooms aren't. Our waitress was pretty friendly and made sure our drinks were always filled. She actually gave us a pitcher of pop we could keep at our table to refill our drinks. She checked on us the perfect amount of times, she didn't constantly stop and again she wasn't annoying by coming every 10 seconds. I will most definitely go back to Gator's Grill!!",

Inferno burger is yummy. Buffalo chicken wrap also pretty good. Have been disppointed by the wings but it may just be my personal preference.",

Large beer selection and very affordable food menu. Started off with an order of the alligator bites which were so unique then for dinner i ordered the special, lobster Mac n cheese which had andouille sausage in it, also very unique! The parking situation was kind of tight but I will definitely be back to check out the outside section which has sand and volleyball! How cool is that!",

Someone should start a league even if it's a one hand beer league with beach balls and beers allowed on the court.    This place has really good, locally sourced food, a huge projection set in their Tiki hut for steelers, and most importantly, a fantastic slatherrring sauce mr GZ's for your wings, ribs, coleslaw, ice cream.  It even makes iron city taste better if you don't over do it with me G'zs.  Try their VFW burger contest created burgers!  They have I believe a Sharpsburger, Shalor, aspinwall, and possibly Deer lakes? Burger.  I'll update the list the next time I'm there which may be in about 10 minutes. Watch for the VFW burger contest which a % of each burger sale going to the VFW's.  I believe it is in Spring!",

    "text": "What a business plan, putting a swimming pool right as you pull into the parking lot!... One can only assume that is the plan for that giant crater that is waiting for you as soon as you pull into the parking lot. Now you will have to drive around the pool construction to get to a parking space, but think bigger picture here.  The food is good except our onion straws came completely unseasoned. The wings aren't bad, above average compared to other places in the Burgh.   The service on the other hand was absurd, now bare with me here... please remember that Breanna, our waitress, can only provide the service that management allows, after all she was trained by someone in management, I hope.  The saga... Ordered ICED tea, came with 3 cubes of melted ice... That is ok, a lot of places make that mistake because the brewed tea is kept room temperature. But when you ask for a glass of ice behind it and that glass arrives less than half full, the excuses end here... Sure the bartender has some blame here, but if what a bartender does effected my tips, I would have had her redo it... Besides I ordered a refill of that now infamous iced tea and it came the same way (counted the ice cubes on one finger) with no accompanying half full glass of ice. Add to it that both me and my wife ordered finger foods, you would think that we wouldn't have had to ask for napkins, let alone bring us 4 when we did.  Being in the customer service industry, I know how hard it is to get good help, but as a business owner, once you put that person on the floor by themselves, you are saying to the consumer that his/her performance is YOUR standard of service... That standard will be your triumph or your demise, it's all on you!",

Their wings are awesome and there's plenty of TV's. The outside area has a fireplace and of course that's a plus. During the summer they have horseshoe pits and other games and leagues for these games but I have never been to that area. It's up the hill on Saxonburg. The only down side is that it's a clean restaurant but not incredibly clean but that's your call I still go back fairly often.",

While the food is good - this is not like some of my other experiences I had (compare to FatHead's, Burgatory, Meat and Potatoes, etc...)     My favorite go to food:  Barbalo Wings (BBQ / Buffalo) My favorite Sandwich:  Fish My favorite Shot:  Jameson - neat My favorite Beer (at Gator's formerly JD's):  Stella  This place is a fun Happy Hour Place and a good venue to watch sports.   I will be back and do my best to create some shenanigans.  7/6/12 - Update:  I am upgrading this review because of the fun factor has been raised.    The outdoor patio is complete (huge fireplace).   I have ventured up to the Cantina where they have outdoor volleyball.    I enjoy the beer specials.  This place is pretty fun.     Enjoy!",
