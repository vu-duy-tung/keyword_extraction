    "text": "Highly recommended: we have been several times for lunch, but never for dinner.   The staff is consistently friendly and gracious, and the kitchen has been consistently excellent. Lunch service is light: we have never had to wait even though the house consists of a server and a gent running the kitchen, and as best we can tell, that's it. The server advised us that they up-staff pretty dramatically for evening service.   The Arancini look like they should be dense little balls of croquette, but instead they are wonderfully light and airy. The butter sauce goes with them nicely, and the bacon is a fun addition.  The crab and bacon hush puppies are served with a Cajun cream foam that covers lovely bacon and corn. Looking at them in cross-section, you would presume that you're about to bite into a mess of heavy bread but instead you are delighted to find every bite is unequivocally crabby without being over done.  The wedge salad is enough for three people.  The chicken nachos are delicious. The portion is large enough to provide a full meal for two, and appetizers for five or six.  There are 20+ draughts with a broad and varied selection, and there is a perfectly reasonable wine selection matched to the fare. Fireside is not a cocktail bar.   We haven't tried all of the sandwiches on the menu, but have been quite pleased with the ones we have.   Peruse the menu before you take your kids -- I think that many kids would find plenty to suit them, but not all.",

The fries were delicious, and the wings were good -- when they weren't overcooked. I couldn't even eat one of mine; it was thoroughly burned. I was happy to see Arsenal cider on tap.  The building totally reminds me of an old Howard Johnsons or Perkins. The windows all around are great, but I was freezing the whole time. Too bad the fire side wasn't closer! While I love the fire smell, I didn't like that it lingered on us long after we left.  The staff was super friendly!",

Our appetizers, the hush puppies and corn dip, were both over-salted.   Our entrees were all bland. Two burgers had little to no seasoning and zero smokey, campfire flavor despite the wood burning grill in the open kitchen. The fries tasted under-cooked and like they were from frozen.The portobello caprese \"salad\" is four slices of tomato, barely a whole mushroom cap, some feta, a little bit of basil, and not worth the $13 price tag. My father got the shrimp and grits, the shrimp was overcooked and the grits were a bland mush that he didn't finish (note my family and I are from North Carolina, so we know grits).   Our server, Tiffanie, was attentive and very nice and did ask why he didn't finish the grits. She also took it off the bill.  Overall, kind of a disappointing meal, though.",

Very sparse ingredients pretty much hidden between two large slices of bread. The was no quality or expertise used in the preparation. Pretty much slapped together and served with cold greasy fries.  As I started to look around I could see they really don't seem to be concerned about being really clean. Counters were not wiped well as neither was the floor. A filthy trash can was being used to hold a box of food the cook was using. All not good signs. Waiter was pleasant. Definitely not worth the price paid.",

Temperature of all the dishes was luke warm at best and even was missing some of the ingredients listed on the menu.

The ambiance was real chill.  However, I wish there had been some music playing.  If there was, it was too low to even hear.    I got the garlic parm wings as an appetizer and they were delicious.  Perfectly cooked and crispy on the outside.  Then our entrees came.  I got the shrimp and grits.  Delicious!  I would definitely get it again.  My friend got the siracha bacon wings and some of them were a little under done.  Not exactly raw, but under cooked enough for her to set a couple of them aside without eating through the center.  She also got the beer cheese and bacon fries.  They were cold.  And SMOTHERED in the beer cheese sauce, which was so rich that she couldn't even eat them.  She sent them back and they were removed from her bill.    We both agreed that we would definitely go back, but we would probably try something different.  I'm a firm believer in giving restaurants more than one shot.  Some nights they're just off their game.  My food was delicious, her food was just okay.  Therefore, this time around, Fire Side Public House gets 3 out of 5 stars.",

Service was very quick considering I went on a Saturday night when it was crowded and there was only one bartender working.

The middle of the bar is a wood fire grill, which is so entrancing to watch as you're sipping a drink. All the food is prepared in front of you, which is fun and nice to know how things are made.. there's no secrets or microwaves. The taps are versatile and the bartenders are super friendly and willing to make recommendations. Also, one of my favorite things is the fact that there is like one TV in the WHOLE bar.. which is SO nice. I was so hoping that it wasn't going to be another sports bar, something pittsburgh DOESNT need. and it delivered completely.. people are actually in conversation and not absentmindedly staring at the boob tube. Lastly, the food was REALLLLYYYY good. I will definitely we back soon!",

If you are looking for anything else besides burgers and beer,  skip this place.   Besides a burger,  the other menu items I've tried are: grilled chicken caesar, pepperoni flatbread, and wings.   Grilled chicken caesar came with finely chopped romaine (wha?) and the romaine itself wasnt grilled as the menu said it would be.  The flatbread was awful.  Ragu sauce on a small strip of pita bread served barely warm.  The wings were rubbery and also barely warm.   Service:  if you want good service be seated near the waitress station at the bar otherwise your waiter will fly by you before you notice.  Acoustics:  The acoustics here are equivalent to a high school gymnasium.  Had a hard time hearing my dinner companion sitting across from me,  and on one visit,  the waiter got my order wrong because he misheard me.",

The servers are attentive, the bartenders are excited to mix interesting drinks, the chefs worked in symphony (I sat at the bar in front of the fire pit once). They seem to enjoy their work, and seem to care.  I have to say that if you stick to the deep fried items and the burgers, your meal is probably really good. My husband's food was fine (burgers) as were the fried appetizers we ordered.  But if you order the other things - they are really missing the mark. They are not thought out. I had the pear salad.  It had way too much pear, a chuck of brie, and 2 tiny, tiny pieces of lettuce. This was not a salad - it is more like a poached pear with cheese dish - period.  $15 was absurd and - make it into a salad! I had the bibb lettuce and chicken salad.  By contrast, it was a whole head of bibb lettuce, at least a cup of dried cheeries, and grilled chicken.  Not another thing on it!  Add a tomato, or cucumbers, or avocado - or all 3.  There was a lot of chicken, but again - boring. And then there was the shrimp and grits.  The grits were dark brown, and there was enough to feed a family of 6.  The shrimp were fine.  But there was so much (orange) liquid fat - 1/2 inch wide and 1/4 inch deep, around the bowl - it looked like a moat circling the grits. Serve a cup of grits (that aren't so full of fat and the grease not separated, the 3-4 shrimp, and call it a day.",

The decor though is modern.  There is an open fire, wood burning grill in the middle of the kitchen. They have about 40 beers on tap with fairly good variety and quality.  They also have a nice cocktail list and are happy to make something off the menu if you tell them what you're looking for.    We came for wing night once (monday) and tried several different preparations, all grilled, though they do fry wings if you want. On Monday's they have 3-4 additional sauces in addition to the three on the menu.  I think the maple bacon siracha was my favorite.  My only complaint is that they spicy ones (including one labeled \"inferno\") were not very spicy.  Another night we came to try the burgers.  I had the fireside burger which comes with bacon on it and thought it was excellently prepared.  The accompanying French fries were also good.  Overall, the prices are very reasonable (I like the option to get a half pint of beer), though they would benefit from an expanded happy hour (to include beer).  The service at the bar has been great, but the one time we sat at a table or waitress struggled a little.  Recently, I was told they plan to expand their menu shortly.",

Huge bar area and a wood grill right in the middle of it (I left smelling like grill but I was NOT mad). Going through the alcohol list they have tons of selections (beer and liquor), a lot of beer on draft.   The service was great, super nice staff, warm hello and goodbye and had a very attentive server. My friend and I split the chicken nachos to start (YOU NEED THESE!) unbelievably good and it's not drenched in nacho cheese and stuff that makes you feel guilty for eating it. I got a salmon blt, it was so good but I could barely finish because of the nachos. The presentation was very cute, they have a kind of mismatched dining ware thing going. The portions were most definitely enough to fill you up.   My only complaint would have to be the very small menu. Maybe a handful of each: appetizer, lunch/dinner/ and salads. Probably not best for the very picky eaters. But I think it's one of those small menu, but everything on it is perfected kinda thing. definitely recommend trying this place out",

The service is amazing. I actually wanted to become friends with my servers and bartenders. They work together as a seamless team.  We weren't drinking, but they have a sh%%load of beers on tap, an actual barrel of infused Wiggle Whiskey, and a fun listing of cocktails.   The only negative is that it is SOOO smoky (grill not cigarette) inside that I left smelling like a campfire and had to remove my clothes. Ventilation is needed.   We will be back very soon--might be our new go-to place for wings.",

The atmosphere was great. Other reviewers noted an overwhelming smokey smell, but I didn't note that.   The beer options were great. A lot of beers that I haven't seen in other places in the city. As for food, highly suggest the crab and bacon hushpuppies. I went on taco Tuesday, so I ordered three: fish, steak and black bean. The steak was a little too overdone and chewy, my only complaint. The toppings on the tacos were fantastic. My partner had a pierogi kielbasa sandwich situation, which he enjoyed.   As another note, I used the restroom -- very clean, but one suggestion. There's two single restrooms right next to one another. It would be nice to see them both labeled for all genders.",

Also, the drinks are relatively cheap  and there is a very good selection of beers. Service was good for being as busy as it was.   The real issue here is the food. I ordered the crab hush puppies which came out literally on a bed of the Cajun sauce. There was too much sauce, the hush puppies were overly salty and not good. I ended up not eating the entire plate. Also, they were delivered after my burger was sent out which was odd.   The person I was with got Mac n cheese- not a hard thing to mess up. I tried a few bites. The cheese was completely flavorless. The bacon, chicken and scallions were not well integrated into the dish.  My Black and Gold burger was what reaffirmed that I won't be coming black. The burger itself was pretty flavorless. I ordered it rare and it came out well done. But worst of all there were supposed to be onions on the burger- but there were none on mine! The bacon was not good. And bacon is a hard thing to get wrong. The person I was with noted the same thing about their peanut butter and jelly burger. They said it was too sweet and the burger was flavorless.   I think this is a good place to come for drinks- but I will not be coming back if I want food.",

    "text": "Terrible customer service, food order are often (every experience I've had),  and rude employees makes this place not one I would recommend.  On top of bad service on more than one occasion, average service on another occasion... And the potential for salmonella poisoning I highly recommend staying away.  My husband and I have been to this place two times on our own. And once with our children. Then attempted again (why? Seemed like it had potential but not actually).   Most recently... November 19 at approximately quarter after four; we went with our sons ages 10-13; we attempted to go with our children we turned around and walked out due to how incredibly rude the employees (specifically the cook and host) were.   We walked in the door and we're greeted rather rudely by the the cook when he said \"Oh God\".  Regardless of how you felt it was and is inexcusable.   He knew that I heard him when he laughed and I said don't worry they are well behaved. He laughed. I didn't. My husband and I take great pride in the fact that wherever we go our children extremely well behaved and more often than not order from the adult menu.   We are certainly not a happy meal and chicken finger family. However to be treated like that when you walk in any restaurant which mind you only had two other customers I would think that the greeting would be that of someone who was glad to have some business! It's not as if it were 7 PM and the happy hour crowd was there. It's a sit down restaurant and microbrewery...  Prior experiences were just as unacceptable. although we had high hopes that this spot would turn out to be a good one considering the failed prior businesses in this location...we were disappointed yet again.   The first time my husband had visited we had gone together we are pretty impressed with the beer selection. But they got our food order wrong... The second time we went we were served raw chicken on nachos which the whole batch in the kitchen was completely contaminated along with the order being incorrect again.... they were always very polite and corrected the orders.  But who wants to go to a place that you have to constantly send your food back because it doesn't get done right the first time.   The nachos were pretty good once corrected. A little pricey for the food... But the portions were decent.   All I can say is this place has terrible service and their employees have a terrible attitude.  Never again.",

We first went in to sit at the bar and the bartender abruptly said we had to sit at the very end of the bar since those stools were saved. What on earth? We then proceeded to go outside to sit on their patio since it was ice cold and no other seats at the bar were free for two. It took sometime for us to get waited on but our waitress was friendly and gave us her opinions of foods we inquired about. However, their happy hour drink specials were too confusing with some beers over this alcohol percentage were part of the special and others were not. It's an all or nothing....don't make it so confusing. We ordered wings as an appetizer and they were good...just the right amount of flavor and crispy. We did order them at 5:30 thinking it was happy hour. I had a steak salad and it was good; nothing mind blowing but good. My BF's steak burger was delicious. When we proceeded to get our bill we asked our server why our wings weren't part of the happy hour special price like the table next to us and she said, \"our happy hour is from 6-8 and you ordered them too early.\" We felt misinformed and slighted because when I went in to use the restroom there were no patrons at any of those \"reserved stools\" at the bar nearly an hour and a half later. Please up your customer service and make happy hour less confusing.",

    "text": "So within the last week I ended up eating here twice as two separate friends both wanted to check it out.   I love the ambiance, particularly how the grilling area is in the middle of the restaurant and that you can see the cooks in action. However, they could have done a better job with ventilation because it got really smoky here after awhile.   While we were waiting we saw some beautiful dishes being served. They also had a pretty nice selection of beers on tap. I was quite impressed with that.   I opted for the beer glazed citrus chicken which was under the skillets menu. Hubby opted for the Quebec burger which is like burger with poutine on top.  When the waitress came back with our orders I noted that I had received the wrong thing. Everyone in my table had their food, but I ended up with a completely different item in the skillet section. I swiftly told the waitress who then took the food and admitted to putting in a different order.  Unfortunately, by the time my correct order had arrived everyone had finished their food. I ended up having to share my husbands burger which was pretty good but a little dry.    Upon trying my food, I felt a little underwhelmed as it was just chicken with some thin sauce that was not that citrusy, and some really cold grilled lemons they had put on my chicken. They seemed to have rushed the order to the point that it was not well executed despite how long it took.   A week later I decided to come back because our friends were raving about their happy hour wing special. We were a table of 5 this time.   Hubby and I went for the various wing flavors. Our party placed the order at the same time, but sadly this place had poor timing and served our friends at very different times. The wings, although big and tasty had way way too much sauce, to the point that we were wiping them with napkins.  I know this place recently opened, but one of the things that they really need to work on is their very poor customer service, also if you mess up an order, make it right somehow. All I got in both cases was a disappointing entree and a half ass apology.",

I stopped in on a Friday at about 630 with my fiance and we found two seats at the bar right in front of the fire the cooks use that's centered in the middle of the bar. I say bar instead of restaurant because the place is mainly a giant bar with the cooks working in an open flame in the middle, with small tables on the outer parameter around the bar. Anyway, we caught the end of happy hour so we got our beers for a nice discount, and there was a really nice selection as well. The tacos were sold out so we couldn't get those. We decided to split an app and burger and they were both delicious. Bold flavors, perfectly cooked. We're definitely going back for taco Tuesday.",

The bartender is exceptionally knowledgable and will gladly pour a sample of anything you're curious about.   The food is AMAZING. I love the wood-fired grilled wings and brie/pear grilled cheese. Their happy hour makes apps super affordable and easy to try all at once, if you so desire.  I'll admit i'm not a huge fan of smelling like a campfire when I leave (although I'm sure some people love that) but what really prompted the five-star rating was the attitude of the staff.  The second time I arrived on location, I got there a few minutes before 10pm. I thought they closed at 11pm but I guess they scaled back their hours. I was STARVING and when I found out they were about to close, I was ready and willing to pop out and find food elsewhere. I work in the service industry and didn't want to be \"that guy.\"  Both the bartender and chef insisted that I stay. They gave me genuine smiles and said that they were happy to feed me. I never felt pushed out. I never felt like an inconvenience.   Bottom line: check this place out. It's a new gem to the area!",

I got a burger and it was probably one of the best burgers I've had. I've went back a few times since & ordered take out and the food kept progressively getting worse and worse. The last time I came here I got a burger for take out. It was absolutely terrible. The burger was dry, it had nothing on it but a little bit of cheese and a very disappointing portion of fries (literally 15 fries total). I was already home so I didn't even bother going back. After that experience I definitely don't plan on going back. To be completely fair, I ordered the burger about an hour before they were about to close so that may have been a factor but still, that is not acceptable. I was very disappointed considering the price of the burger.   All in all, food varies. It can be really good one time and average another. If you do eat here, I would try to avoid take out!!",

    "text": "When looking for a lunch spot in or near the Shadyside area, The Fire Side Public House came to mind.  I've wanted to give it a try since it opened because I heard good things.  I was worried that it might be busy after reading a few other reviews, but the place was pretty empty when I met my brother on a Tuesday afternoon.  While waiting at the bar, I ordered the Bacon and Crab Hush Puppies.  I was informed shortly after placing my order that they were out of the Cajun Mousse they are typically served on.  I was fine with that, and the cook offered to give me a few of their sauces to try instead.  The hush puppies were good, nice and crunchy on the outside but lukewarm in the center.  I thought they could have been hotter.  I did like trying the different sauces and the Siracha aioli was my favorite with the hush puppies.  The cook said that was his favorite, too, when he inquired about my feelings regarding the sauces.  Once my brother arrived, we ordered up a couple burgers.  My brother went with the Breakfast Burger, I went with the Fire Side.  The burger itself (grass-fed beef) was the highlight for me though it was a bit overcooked (I ordered medium but there was no pink in the middle).  Unfortunately the bun was not sturdy enough to support said burger and fell apart before I was done.  There's definitely that wood-fired smell, but, well, it's in the name so you shouldn't be surprised.  Knowing this is their cooking method should also explain the wait.  They do have their own parking lot which is a plus.  Though this was my first visit, I should mention their menu does change.  I'm not sure how frequently, but they previously offered a shrimp and grits plate that is no longer available.  A couple seated next to me left when they discovered this.  I have mixed feelings.  The draft list is above average.  The food is okay.  The service is great.  (Our server didn't charge me for a beer because they were out of the mousse for the hush puppies.)  I liked Fire Side Public House but there were too many hiccups for it to be my first choice next time I'm in the neighborhood.",

So, we went. The first time we went for a snackish-lunch and just got a few apps to share. We had the pierogies, the crab hush puppies and French fries. As a side note, I really think the worth of a restaurant can be measured by the deliciousness of their fries. Really? It's such a simple thing, but so hard to get right, never mind perfect! And when a restaurant serves frozen, pre-packaged junk sticks, I feel like they are saying outright \"Don't come here; we don't care.\" Anyway, I degress.  The crab hush puppies were super. The pierogies were fried, which isn't my thing, but the BF liked them. And the fries....Vonderbar! We went again for an actual dinner last night. We started with an app- they have happy hour from 5-7 with $5 shareables- the crab hush puppies again. Then I ended up getting the chicken club sandwich, which was one of the best chicken sandwiches I can remember. It was cooked perfectly and the wood smoked flavor was unbelievable. It comes with thick cut bacon, on toasted bread with lettuce and tomato. I expected it to come on a bun, and was weary when I saw the bread, but it was perfect. Not to toasted that it cut your mouth, and held up to the sandwich pretty well. The BF had the sword fish, which is also not my thing, but he loved it. I mean, really loved it. Green beans and a wild rice kind of thing finished of his meal. He was really happy with it, although the rice was weird to me. It tasted like Uncle Ben's chicken rice or something. AND, the best part, the service was great. So I guess it's True, redemption is a dish best severed wood smoked!",

It's conveniently located behind Target in East Liberty with it's own parking lot which was nice. I went on a Thursday night with friend. It wasn't crowded, and one of the staff members inside actually saw us coming in and met us at the door and held the door open for us.  We decided to sit at the bar. The bartenders were very attentive and they had a huge selection of drafts, and the bartender had good recommendedations and let us know about the happy hour special, which was a 16oz draft for $6. Not bad at all!  We ordered food as well as drinks....I got the queso burger (came with fries) and my friend had the buffalo chicken flat bread. Both entrees were absolutely delicious! Nice portion sizes too. Overall great food, great beer selection, and excellent service! Will definitely return!!",

I remember this place as a hotdog joint but boy has it changed! There's a beautiful wood fired oven with a nice lacquer top bar and sexy high top tables in there. The service was welcoming as well which made for an enjoyable evening.   The menu made me want to try a few different things but some discipline kicked in and I went for a burger. While we waited for our food, the drinks came. I was in love at first sip. Omg...I wondered what had hit my tongue? Whatever it was took my taste buds on a journey which hit all of my senses and captured the rhythm of my stroke. Oh, wait...I'm sorry. I can't divulge everything this drink did to me. You gotta order it for yourself. Lol (it's the lemon one)  Next.   My burger (black n gold or yellow) came with the sweet smoky bacon, caramelized onions with a generous slice of gouda that made my mouth sing. I actually stared at the burger for a moment. I almost sighed out loud which is something that I try not to do since it can be misinterpreted. The fries were good...they could've been a little warmer for my liking but truly not a major detractor to this meal. The chipotle ketchup was yum.   So, I guess you could say I love this place. Is the food reasonably priced? Yes. Are the drinks expensive? Yes...but do you want to have an experience? Just do it. Well worth it in my opinion.",

What I love the most about this place is the windows- it's completely open, making it so bright and beautiful inside. The service was great. We were able to choose our own seats and opted for some that were out of the direct sunlight. I wasn't super hungry, so I just went with an order of fries with a house salad. My SO got a burger and his dad had a chicken salad. All of our food was fresh and really tasty. I loved the blueberry vinaigrette dressing.The fries were super tasty as well. I had the fries with their blackberry bbq sauce, which was unique and tasty. Overall- we had a great time and I am looking forward to coming here again.",

The first time I had anything from them was when they donated some wings to a grand opening party at Painting with a Twist in East Liberty.  The flavors were unique and delicious (sriracha maple bacon and blackberry bbq).  The menu pulls from lots of local sources, including Dave & Andy's ice cream.  Super yummy vanilla ice cream for dessert!  It's always cool to get a full-on Pittsburgh vibe when you're at a restaurant.  Due to dietary restrictions (gluten-free), I am limited to certain menu items.  The manager, Sean, was very hospitable and brought me a tray of gluten-free sauces to try for my grilled wings.  He was knowledgeable and helpful, and really added to my already-good opinion of the restaurant.    Five stars would be if there were more food options for people with dietary restrictions -- keeping separate fryers for allergens, etc., so I could try more foods on the menu to review -- but otherwise, a solid four stars.",

    "text": "I was torn between 3 and 4 stars. I would give it a 3.5, First huge plus, as others have mentioned, is the free parking. The vibe is also really cool, with big windows, high ceilings inside and cool decor. Also seems like they will have nice outside seating once it gets warmer.   We were immediately told by our server that the very giant beer list hanging over the bar was \"probably out of date\" and to look at the printout instead. OK, but maybe someone should feel a tiny bit compelled to update the giant sign. Good beer selection but small servings at regular serving prices and regular servings overpriced by a dollar or two, not terrible but worth mentioning for those reading a review.   We started with the nachos. Let me say I am totally biased against nachos. I think they are one of the worst appetizer choices at restaurants because they always just seem like shitty chips with sparse toppings. These ones were pretty good, with generous toppings including pulled chicken, but they still haven't swayed me into ordering nachos more often.   Two of us had burgers and two had the ribs, which were on special. Ribs were the way to go here. Even thought it was a half rack, the serving was totally gigantic and even the human garbage disposal was unable to finish. The burgers were good (one queso and one black and gold) -- the burger itself was cooked medium as requested and had a good flavor -- but they were nothing to blow my mind. The fries were more thick cut with coarse sea salt which was tasty. Good portion for the fries too. Looked like a small serving but kept me from overdoing it.    I would come back if someone invited me, but primarily for the atmosphere.",

    "text": "The ManBeast and I are currently sitting in the Fire Side Public House for the second dinner in 3 nights -- that's saying something, even for a couple who tends to get stuck on places we like (& then revisiting multiple times). So, why are we back?  THE PROS: The food is fantastic.  Correction: the BURGERS (the only food we have tried) are fantastic.  Cooked to order, quality meat (grass-fed beef, according to their menu), grilled to perfection on the open wood-fired grill that dominates the open-plan kitchen, lovingly sandwiched between brioche buns.   The ManBeast has now ordered the eponymous Fire Side Burger for the second time. He said he couldn't imagine a better burger.  I had the Quebec Burger on Friday and am currently (slightly...okay, more than a little) regretting not ordering it again. BUT I haven't yet tried the burger I've ordered tonight -- as a good scientist, I am experimenting with the Black & Yellow Burger. I expect it will taste as good...or better.  MORE PROS: Terrific draft menu. Beer lovers rejoice! The PA-brewed options are marked with a keystone on their chalkboard menu. Some terrible (read: standard) options BUT they are far outweighed by the quality offerings. A good blend of IPAs, stouts, and adventurous/different options, like the Anderson Valley Briny Mellon Gose.  Our Friday night server, Phil, was great. I thought he reminded me of my husband. More hilariously (for me), my husband thought he reminded him of my husband. When asked why, he only said, \"He doesn't know how to end conversations, like me.\" (Phil, you do you.)  Setting and ambiance are pretty solid. In fashionable hipster style, your burger arrives on a plank, hand-cut fries in a metal basket. They're definitely vibing industrial-hipster chic, but in a way that's not off-putting or alienating, even to the most ardent yinzer bleeding black and yellow. TVs unobtrusively played the Pens games both times we've been here.  CONS: Next door to the World's Worst Post Office.  (In other words, no real cons.)  Overall, get yourself to Fire Side.  (And say hi to Phil.)",

First of all, there is a legitimate free on-site parking lot for this place, which I feel like is fairly unheard of in east liberty or anywhere in this town where you'll be going out for drinks/bar food. This alone, raised its rating for me.   Our bartender/server was very friendly and for the most part good at his job.  We were a fairly large group - 10 people, and he did screw up one of the checks, but he fixed it promptly.  I did also hear that one of the members of our group ordered a chicken sandwich, and the chicken was underdone...yikes! The beer options were excellent, and the cocktails were fun (I didn't try any, but they sounded tasty and I liked the fact that they all had names referencing Anchorman)  After asking the server if they rotate and always reference movies, he informed me they do - which is fun.  I would definitely be willing to come back here and actually try the food, but if all else - it was a great place to drink on a Saturday night since it wasn't crowded and we had room to sit and could hear each other chat.",

Turns out the event was supposed to be the rep approaching customers only if they made a Spoonwood purchase. He was to be notified by bartender so he could chat with us. According to the rep he was never informed of our purchase. Overall this seemed a poor way to conduct such an event; both on behalf of the restaurant and the rep. We had onion rings that came with beer cheese made from one of the Spoonwood pours=really good. The chef came and spoke with us about the food. We had a great seat at the bar in front of the wood stove and got to watch the chef and his team in action. Everything coming out looked amazing. Because of this and the chat with the chef we will go back to give the place a second try. If not for him, the lack of organization and communication typically would not afford that.

We arrived there around 8 on a Friday night and we were able to be seated right away. We had the choice of sitting at \"bar\" which overlooked wood fire cooking area. However, we opted for a high top table by a window. First of all, there were so many things on the menu that I wanted to try so I had a hard time deciding what to order. I went with the Buffalo Chicken Grilled Cheese and my boyfriend got the skillet pasta. Our food came out very quickly and it was so delicious! My grilled cheese had a kick from the buffalo sauce, but the chicken had that wood fire taste... Yum! We ordered the campfire smores for dessert. It came out in a little cast iron skillet. It had a layer of chocolate, then some Golden Grahams, and then all of that goodness was topped with roasted marshmallows! Amazing!! Finally, (because like I said, I couldn't decide on what I wanted!), I ordered the roasted corn dip to take home. I ate it the next day with the Parmesan pita chips and oh em gee.... It was delicious! I will definitely be back again!   On top of everything else, the staff is so friendly and accommodating! We had a very great experience overall!",

I'm not a vegetarian but I can appreciate a vegetarian plate that's creative and healthy. There are plenty of dishes like the Portobello salad with roasted pistachios that are veggie and awesome. My mom had a burger and fries served on a cool wooden cutting-board looking plate so the presentation was really cool.  The dining atmosphere is laid back and you've always got something to focus on with the huge grill right in the center.  All of the staff we had interaction with was really informative about the menu and its items and were relaxed, which is a good thing in my opinion.  I urge everyone to give Fire Side a try!

The atmosphere is relaxed and casual, but the decor is modern and they use high-quality ingredients.  I love the cocktail menu, which is based on Will Ferrell movies right now (Elf and Step Brothers).  Cocktails are a little expensive, but beers are cheaper and they run specials each week.  I have had burgers and nachos there--both very solid.  The \"small plates\" aren't really small, so watch out!  Mac and cheese or nachos are big enough to share with two.  Servers are very friendly.",

    "text": "My friend and I came here for dinner last night. Overall, the staff was very polite and personable. They checked on us often. I'm not exactly sure who the server was because two people seemed to be taking care of us at different times. While confusing, it was a great to see the staff working as a team because we were well taken care of so and never had to wait for the server. The restaurant is beautiful and I really Liked the open layout of the restaurant and the dark wood tables. The open kitchen takes up about half of the space. The women's restroom was very clean, however it reminded me of a fast food bathroom with the red tile floor. Now onto the food and drinks. The cocktails were appropriately titled from Elf the movie (e.g., \"Santa, I know him!\"). They came quickly and were delicious. We ordered two appetizers: the crab hush puppies and the shrimp stuffed avocados. You MUST try the hush puppies!! The sauce was delightful, although we wished for more spice. The puppies themselves were flavorful, crisp on the outside and cooked to perfection. The avocado, on the other hand, was not stuffed. The shrimp and salsa was situated next to a grilled half avocado, which was a bit unripe. The shrimp and salsa did not have much flavor. I wouldn't recommend this. Entree wise we ordered the asparagus baguette and the shrimp and grits. I Loved the baguette! There was a wonderful jam on the sandwich that really complimented the feta and grilled asparagus. It came with crispy fries on the side. The shrimp and grits were flavorful, but not what we were expecting. The grits tasted like over seasoned warm cornbread batter and the shrimp were tough and overcooked.  For dessert, we had both the blueberry cobbler and the s'mores. They were served beautifully in tiny cast iron skillets. The cobbler was topped off with fresh vanilla ice cream. Although it didn't have a crumbly crust, it had fragrant lemon undertones that packed a punch! It was lovely. The s'mores was not so great. The first layer was melted chocolate, the second layer was a graham cereal topped with huge toasted marshmallows. It was hard to eat because the marshmallows were not melted and the cereal seemed stale in the melted chocolate. It sounded great, but it just didn't work. Overall, everything was a hit or miss. I will definitely be back, the burgers looked amazing, and the staff was great!!",

I took my boyfriend here for a few drinks on a whim after a quick trip to Target, since the Thai takeout we'd placed an order for was going to take about half an hour longer than we had originally expected. The atmosphere is still really nice and cozy, and the smoke smell isn't too overpowering. I like being close to the grill, because it means you can see and smell the amazing bacon being cooked. This really is a craft beer lover's dream with forty different brews on tap and reasonably priced 8oz and 16oz pours. We received attentive and excellent service, and the bartender did a wonderful job recommending some interesting IPAs for us to try. Good service carries more weight with me if my party is only having a few drinks, and my latest experience here means I'll definitely be back soon for another meal and some more beer.",

The place was very loud - it wasn't very crowded and I still had a hard time hearing what people at my table were saying (music was also too loud and not very good).  I got what I thought was a portabello salad, but was literally just a couple of slices of tomato and portabello on a plate with a pile of pistachios in the middle, which was not very good and cost $13 (more than one of the burgers).  My friends all had burgers that were cold and described as \"ok\".  The beer also seemed to be overpriced ($4.75 for an 8 oz glass).  On the plus side, I had a good beer that I'd never seen before and the space itself is very interesting.  Probably won't be going back here except maybe for a drink.",

Monday night is Yuengling and Wing night, Yuengling is ... yuengling, wings - BBQ and Hot - were nice and juicy, not too saucy, probably less spicy than what some people want. Main portions are \"Pittsburgh\" sized, which means the Yinzer salad is for 2 people and the sausage was enough on its own.   Wasn't smoky - the range hood does a good job keeping the smoke down, although the door was open, so maybe this would change in winter. The only downside to this place (and anything north of the busway) is how disconnected it feels from the rest of Shadyside/E Liberty .

In an attempt to air out the building, they kept the doors open which made way for flies to roam inside. Nothing I love more than swatting bugs away from my food.   In my vegetarian world of dainty salads and puny vegetables, Fire Side blows them all out of the water with its colossal black bean burger. Not only was it enormous, it was sooo delicious! The sirarcha aioli was so incredible that it makes the heartburn worth it. Just ask my boyfriend who was practically drinking it. The spinach and avocado topping made the burger even better. It was essentially all my favorites in one burger. Definitely one of the top veggie burgers I've had in Pittsburgh! It must not have been a pretty sight to watch me attack my meal. When a burger is twice the size of your mouth, it's hard to eat like a lady.   Would I come back? Absolutely! To all my vegetarians, the black bean burger is a must!",

The garlic parm wings had too much garlic unless you absolutely love garlic. I don't, so I wasn't a fan. Wasn't a fan of the Korean BBQ wings either; I thought the flavor was a bit too strong for me. But do try the hush puppies! They were very tasty and were the best part of the meal. All of the different components of the hush puppies worked really well together. For my entree, I ordered the Quebec burger, which was very salty, so I barely ate any of it. The restaurant itself is nice; it has high ceilings and the grilling area is right at the center of the restaurant, so you could pretty much watch your food getting made. I do hope to try Fire Side again, but only after they tone it down a little.   Taste | 3 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 3 OVERALL | 3.5",

The grilled corn dip was excellent, and unexpectedly (but delightfully) spicy.  We both had the Black Bean Burger. The avocado, baby spinach and other toppings were delicious, but both of us were not wild about the burger.  The service was excellent! Prices were reasonable.",

    "text": "Every so often your mind wonders if what use to be has been filled in yet.  Also you think to yourself is it going to be any good or even better than the last establishment that filled a space.  That's what I was thinking when I stumbled upon (or re-stumbled upon this space) Fire Side Public House.  After running errands and needing a quick bite to eat, I found myself here, happy.  Walking in here everything feels familiar.  There is that familiar diner feel with the countertop and laid back atmosphere.  Walk in, find yourself a spot and take in the aromas of the food that you have a front row seat to see prepared for you.  Warmer months allow for outdoor seating if that is your thing.    I found myself quickly looking over the menu and finding it hard to decide on exactly what I needed to satiate myself with.  Deciding shortly thereafter that everything looked amazing I made a decision to have a small bite to eat here and then take a meal with me to eat later during my lunch break at work.  While I waited for my meal to go I decided to try the pierogies.  A generous portion of potato filled pasta that are grilled, then served with caramelized onions, fresh green onions and a horseradish aioli.  I love pierogies, but what put these over the top for me was the aioli.  That spiciness that was afforded to allow my palette to enjoy all the flavors of the plate was everything and then some.  If I'm honest, I wanted to ask to take some of that aioli home with me, I almost licked my plate that's how good it is.  The service here is top notch, servers are always smiling and the chefs are really on top of things in the kitchen, they are masters of that wood fire grill.  For my meal to go I decided to give the Queso Burger a try.  Anytime that you fuse some Mexican flavor with a burger I am down to try it.  Especially when you got queso fresco, cilantro lime salsa and sriracha aioli on a wood fired grilled burger patty, mouth watering.  Adding the coolness of the avocado clicks with this burger.  I definitely had my fill of good food that day.  You never have to sell me when the side is fresh cut fries.  So was this place even better than the last establishment?  Well, you have to ask yourself: are you a hamburger person or a hot dog person?  That's what it comes down to for this location.  I'm pretty partial to hot dogs, but because of the hamburger I had that day, this is definitely a great reuse of space, but better, I don't know...I like my burgers and dogs equally.",

    "text": "Great addition to East Liberty!  I had never been to Station Street Hot Dogs so I was excited to check out its replacement. After a Saturday at the mall of shopping with my daughter we were famished. My fellow Yelp buddy Rochelle H. told me about The Fire Side Public House just opening the day before and that they were doing a \"soft opening\" and that all of the food was comped as long as you bought a drink (pop, beer etc.) so my daughter and I high tailed it over there to meet up with Rochelle and her daughter and check the place out!   Upon entering we were greeted and asked to be seated right next to Rochelle and her daughter. Surprisingly the place wasn't packed at all. A few seconds later Dane C. our waiter came over and took our drink orders. The concept of the restaurant is all about the wood fire grill that sits in the middle of the restaurant that everything is cooked on. They also specialize in craft beer. The menu consists of Small Bits, Wings, Wood Grill Items, Salads and Skillet served items for now will more items to be added once the restaurant is running at full capacity.   My daughter started off with the Beer Cheese & Bacon Fires (Fresh cut fries, Apple Wood Bacon and Smoked Cheddar Beer Cheese) off the Small plates menu and I went with the Smoked Chicken Nachos. (Apple Wood Smoked Chicken, tortilla chips, grilled corn, black beans, sour cream, salsa verde and avocado.) I also added a order of grilled Garlic Parmesan wings. A few minutes later our small plates came. Let me tell you that there is nothing small about the Smoked Chicken Nachos portions! It could easily feed two to three people! I only ate about half. My daughter loved her Beer Cheese Fries as well.  For our main dishes my daughter choose the Fire Side Burger (Grass Fed Beef, Apple Wood Bacon, pickles, White Cheddar, lettuce, tomato and onions on a Brioche Bun). I choose the Chicken Skillet Pasta (Chicken Sausage, fire roasted tomatoes, Basil infused cream, Pappardelle and Fontina Cheese). It was absolutely delicious! I took a bite of my daughters burger and let me just say that I was one of the best burgers I have ever tasted! I finally got my wings after my main food already came. It was the place's second night being open so I will cut them some slack.   After we were done with our meals we had to try the desserts. My daughter ordered the Campfire S 'Mores (Fire Roasted Marshmallows, milk chocolate, and Honey Grahams cereal). I picked the Blueberry Cobbler. The blueberry cobbler was simply spectacular! My daughter must of loved her S 'Mores as she finished it before I could even taste it!   Dane C. took excellent care of was the entire evening and never let our glasses get more than a quarter empty before he brought us another Pepsi. My only complaint it that the wings need to come out a lot faster then there are now. I'm sure once the kinks get worked out that this will be rectified.  I also had the pleasure of meeting the owner Robert Miller who also owns Sidelines Bar & Grille. He was very appreciative for my critiques,  ideas and feedback.  I think the restaurants concept will be welcomed with open arms by the East Liberty community.",

Other servers around us seemed to know what they were doing. I'd suggest sitting at the bar to avoid the terrible servers. Or maybe do takeout",

My friend and I shared an order of crab hush puppies that were ok.  Nothing to write home about, but the aioli sauce served with it was good. For dinner I had a bourbon glazed chicken sandwich that was decent.  I'd order it again.   They have a ton of beers listed on their chalkboard but many aren't available.  That's ok, the selection is still admirable and you can certainly find something to fit the bill. It is very dark inside and gives you the impression of a place you'd go on a date, not with a group of friends.  You can sit at the counter or at high tops that surround the perimeter.  The grill is in plain view in the middle of the room so you can watch the chef cooking. I think I need to come back again, they definitely deserve a second look from me.",

I was craving a burger, so I got the Black & Gold burger with fries. Service was a little slow. It took about 30 minutes for us to get our food after ordering. The burger was super juicy. I really like the type of roll they use. It would have been better, however, if they used beef that was a little more lean. The fat was dripping out of the burger onto the plate more than normal, and the bun was also soaked with fat. The fries were seasoned well, thick cut, and nice and crispy.  There are plenty of other burger spots in the city, but this is worth a shot if you're in the area.",

And that is why I am giving this place 3 Stars. Having been here often, I am frustrated with the inconsistency in the dishes and how they are are presented. Sometimes the dishes are extremely greasy/oily. Sometimes the wings aren't cooked well enough. And the tacos I ordered tonight had grease and juice pouring out when I picked them up. And the bartender who I think is new because I've never seen her before, was pretty rude. There is so much potential in this restaurant, just need more consistency.",

    "text": "We stoped in for lunch the day after Christmas. The fellow behind the bar was polite, helpful and knowledgeable about the different brews on tap. After some discussion he recommended the Morgantown for me and he was spot on, it was great.  The kitchen area is in the center of thd bar, the other 2 workers never stoped. It is real wood fire and one guy seemed to be doing prep work and cooking while the other tended to keeping the fire just right (please get the poor guy the ove glove for god sakes)   The food was delicious although a bit pricey especially for a pub setting but that's the problem I don't think they know what they're trying to be.   It's actually quite sad this could be a really great  place with just a few minor changes for example: the glass on the exterior should be thoroughly cleaned, Decor should be a little bit more warm and inviting and building some type of Cabinetry around the center kitchen area wouldn't be a bad idea either nobody wants to see a gross looking floor drain in the center of the kitchen while they're eating or dingy metal shelving.  They have all the Necessities for having a great place; good staff, good food and good beer, a few tweaks and this would be our new favorite place. Oh and as we sat there watching the poor bartender have to walk a marathon every time he needed to tend to someone near the front door, I couldn't help but think some type of pass through or walkthrough for them on that side of the bar would be beneficial.",

We also got the cobb salad, you know, to feel somewhat healthy by our party. The only bad part of the meal was the corn dip. Based on photos other people had posted we also got the corn dip to go. What we received was the dregs of the corn dip. There was a layer of separated grease floating on what looked like curdled milk and corn. It was a bummer.

The truffle fries, wood fired blackberry bbq wings, & crab stuffed hush puppies were outstanding! I'd have a hard time trying anything else because I'm already craving these again. Had the fried seasoned wings too but they were like any bar wings. I tried 2 mixed drinks. They were good but I thought they were a bit overpriced & small. Not sure that I'd get a drink again.

Came on a Friday night and got seated right away. They take reservations online through Open Table.   I'd definitely be back for both food and drinks!",

I was craving mussels and they did not disappoint. Although the presentation was very simple (mussels and broth only), they were delicious. The white wine butter broth was a perfect balance and very flavorful. They came with a side of three big pieces of grilled bread to soak up all the yumminess. The only negative thing I would say is that I had about 7 or 8 mussels that didn't open  I also ordered the crab hush puppies, they were pretty good but they were very oily and salty. Loved the sriracha aioli served with it though!",

The place was ok, the food was actually quite good (until the person waiting on us inadvertently spit all over it while talking to us).   I feel bad for the person waiting on us, so I will attempt to keep this as nondescript as possible so as to spare them...but my girlfriend and I both work / worked in the food service industry and this was not acceptable. It is not acceptable to come to the table looking like Scarface with a powdered nose. Its not acceptable to make comments like \"You're in luck, this usually isnt fresh!\". They had no idea what beers were in stock, and apparently out of the whole draft list about 4 were actually on tap?  Wont be back, and wish I never came. Disappointed as the other reviews dont seem to reflect this; but given the abundance of other great dining options go ahead and do yourself a favor and skip this one.",

We also split Parmesan fries; they also have many fry flavors. The reasons I give 4 stars is that it was super crowded and the parking lot is tiny with no street parking available. And my friend and I both tried ordering beers and our first three or four choices were sold out... but were still on the beer board. Cross them out! I got frustrated and just ordered a yuengling since my two craft beer choices were out.",

We had our daughter with us so I was glad to see they had highchairs and kids activities with crayons.  We went at happy hour so all local beers with a keystone symbol were $4. We started off with perogie appetizer. It was really garlicky but good. I got the crab cake sandwich with green beans and my husband got the turkey burger with fries. He said it was the best turkey burger he had ever eaten. My crab cake was really good. No complaints on our food.  I loved how the place was all windows and it was a really sunny day so it made it really nice inside and you would never know it was 30 degrees outside.  My only complaint is that they don't have a changing table in the bathroom. They did have a small circular table though that we made do.  I'm really surprised that every time we drive by it looks pretty empty. This place met all of our needs so we will be back!",

There is a small amount of tables lining the wall, and a big wrap around bar. Seating large parties may be a problem, especially during busy times. But seating 4 for a Saturday lunch was fine. There is a decent beer list, and a list of specialty cocktails as well. The food however, was excellent! We started with an order of the nachos, and they were phenomenal. Beer cheese all over them, and layered as well so you dont just end up with a pile of chips. I ordered the Steak burger and wow, it was so good. I ended up taking the bun off of the second half of it because I really wanted to finish it. Definitely give this place a try!",

While there are tables near the back, most seating looks like it's at the bar and high tops. It's an open kitchen style so you get a nice view of the grill at the bar, which is cool. Staff are friendly and sometimes more than one person helps you which can be a bit confusing, but I've never had any misunderstandings.  Sriracha maple wings: 6 for $7. Get them charred on the grill for an extra $1 which you can't really get at other places so it's worth a try. Love this flavor and they top it with green onions and bits of bacon. 4/5  Queso burger: $14 with a side of fries. A good sized burger with a Southwest feel of avocado, pico de Gallo, and cilantro lime sour cream. 4/5  Definitely recommend for a good burger and beer.",

    "text": "My wife and I were looking for a good lunch spot on a Sunday afternoon in this area.  We debated on going to one of our favorite restaurants or trying something new.  We decided to try out The Fire Side.  I was sold by looking at the good looking pictures of their burgers on Yelp.  They looked really good and I was starting to crave them.       We ended up meeting my brother in law and his girlfriend here.  It wasn't too busy so we found a 4 top table for the four of us.  The waitress greeted us and gave us our menus.  What we noticed right away was that they had different size glasses for their beer.  A smaller one was for around $3.50 and a large beer was around $7.50.  We ordered the larger one and were disappointed to see that it was a normal size beer for $7.50.  We thought that price was good for a tall glass beer not your normal size.        Looking around we thought the restaurant was nice.  It was open and we were having a good time.  The waitress was nice and gave us good service too.           The problem was our food.  I ordered their Fireside burger cooked medium.  My wife ordered a burger too cooked medium rear.  Our waitress asked how we wanted it cooked but they both came out well done.  We didn't say anything mostly because the food took a while to come out and we needed to get to another place pretty soon.  Otherwise we would have sent it back.  I was disappointed in my burger.  It looked good from the outside.  The picture I took of it looks great  but it was dry and over cooked on the inside.   I had to put ketchup on it to make it better and I hate doing that.  Carrie felt the same way about her burger.  She got a salad too and I ordered fries.  No complaints on the fries and salad they were good.  My brother in law ordered some muscles with his girlfriend and some nachos that looked good too.  I think they enjoyed their food.        Our experience here with the overpriced beer and over cooked burgers would make me have to give them a 2.  I want to give them a 2 in a half because we did like the place and my brother in law seemed to like his food but that burger was just so bad.       I would like to try this place again to give them another try.  I like the area and other people have had better experiences here but again it was too expensive for the beer and those burgers tasted like something you get at a fast food restaurant.",

We could see the nachos on the prep table in front of us and kept thinking they were done and ready to be served. But we were wrong! The chef kept putting more and more toppings on to make them even more delicious! The pulled chicken sandwiches were pretty good.

But what stands out is there were only three other people in the Restaurant other than me...  3. When my meal was served I noticed that it was wrong, yes they screwed up the order.   4. When the order came back again the bun had this brown dirty oily area on the top bun in the back  I'll add pictures.   5. I was not given any napkins, I asked for napkins and a fork. My server took way too much time. She went in the back to get the fork and napkin when they are under the counter in front of me also remember there were very little people in the Restaurant!!!",

We sat on one side of the horseshoe-shaped dining area to watch the TV. In the middle is the bar, grill, and food-prep counter, with big glass windows all around. We enjoyed grilled ribs (sriracha maple syrup bacon and garlic parmesan) and split a house salad for a small but delicious lunch. There were lots of good-looking options on the menu, including the burgers and a number of sides. Despite the loud music, this would probably be a nice place to come back and try other dishes. They don't seem to be able to handle groups larger than four, and the restrooms are single stalls and gendered. Ample free lot parking.",

Outdoor seating is available in the summer months.  The menu is upscale comfort food, but always changing. A lot of their food is locally sourced if that matters to you. My last visit was wing night, so I tried the buffalo ranch, Sriracha maple bacon, and blackberry BBQ. We shared a side of crab hush puppies which came with a Sriracha aioli. Prior times here I've tried burgers and flatbreads which were also good. I've never had unpleasant service. Their draft beer selection is above average and they have some specials a few nights per week. Currently flights are only available (and on special) on Thursdays, but they do offer an 8oz pour if you're into sampling.   My only complaint during my last visit was that I wasn't seated at a good angle to watch the penguins game, but all in all Fire Side makes for a good night out.",

The location is interesting because you can watch food being prepared and cooked in the fire.  It can be a bit noisy with all the glass and hard surfaces.    Our waitress was friendly and OK, somewhat overly friendly and did disappear for a while.   When we tasted our water, I was interested to see if anyone noticed the strange taste.  Yes indeed, it was mentioned immediately by someone in our group.  It tasted as though the glasses had been cleaned but not rinsed properly or the rinse sink needed to be changed to clean water. They were out of all the daily specials so were ordered off the menu.  My Wildfire burger was very good and had a little heat from the Buffalo sauce.  The Fresh cut fries were good and a bit over salted.",

Our waitress was awesome and broke down the menu and gave recommendations in every single section which was so so helpful. the sandwich portions are a good size for sure-will not leave feeling hungry. They have a large amount of PA beers which i loved. I got the bourbon chicken sandwich and it was really good but weirdly they only toasted one side of the bread so it got soggy. Prices are good for what you get here. Brussel sprout appetizer is AMAZING for sure get it. I liked you could watch the chefs make the food as well. Large vent above stove in the middle creates a really cool atmosphere. They also have a speciality menu of items not typically on the menu so for sure check that out as well.",

Amazing flavor from their wood fired grill, which is featured as part of their open-air kitchen setup.  The steak was perfectly cooked and came with a nice sauce on top, along with two sides, grilled asparagus and rice.  Great combination of flavors!  We started with some appetizers including the Crab Hushpuppies....so GOOD!  The flavors in this dish will amaze you!  Also shared the grilled and nicely charred, Parmesan & Garlic Wings.  Very tasty and asked our server for some Wildfire Sauce on the side to dip them in, which made them even better.    A couple of nice Jack & Cokes to wash it all down. Our server was terrific and we complemented her on everything along with leaving a generous tip.  Can't wait to come back for our 3rd visit soon! Stop in and give them a chance to show you what they do so very well.",

I attempted to tackle the biggest crab cake I've had in my life, and to my surprise I failed. Not only was the sandwich hot and fresh, but it was the size of a half pound burger, something you don't ever see in Pittsburgh. I highly recommend it and garlic aoli fries while you're at it.

As someone who enjoys trying different beers, I was really excited to be able to order 8oz beers for exactly half the price of a pint. The draft list is pretty long and has a great variety to choose from! My fiance ordered from the cocktail list and was impressed with the quality of the drinks. The fries with beer cheese and bacon were a great accompaniment to the beer! We also ordered the s'mores, which were nice and toasty but, in my opinion, could have had more chocolate. The service was also good. I definitely plan to return!",

    "text": "I'm surprised at the good reviews I'm seeing here. I went to the Fireside with friends and it was terrible. The food was barely bar food, unseasoned, hugely overcooked, and then literally flooded with sauce. Our sandwiches had so much sauce on them that they fell apart just trying to pick them up! The appetizers were the same way, with flavorless bits swimming in an actual bowl of sauce. We watched in disbelief as eat plate of food that the kitchen made was plated and then covered with one sauce after another until it was unrecognizable. Worse, the sauces are almost flavorless. I cannot imagine anyone with kitchen experience allowing plates like that to be served.  The beer at Fireside was good, but our server could not have known less about it, or any of their drinks. His first approach was to ask us if we had decided on drinks yet, only to slowly realize that we had no menus or way to order. Once we got menus, several of us had questions, none of which he had any notion of. He didn't know ingredients of drinks, the differences in any of the beers, or even how much drinks cost, as it was not listed. \"They are regular drink prices,\" was the quote of the night.  I'll say that one start was for the wonderful smell of open wood fire when you walk in. If you have to go, enjoy that smell, then go somewhere else. You'll be happier for it.",

I am pleased to see they offer Arsenal Cider, too. I was helped by Tony, who was excellent and his recommendation for an IPA (the \"H2P\") was spot on.",

It's really cool that you can see the kitchen from every seat in the dining area.  It was clean, open, and inviting.  Not much as far as decor, but the food was really good.  We started with the crab hush puppies, they were hot, crispy, tasted like crab, had a great spicy sauce, fresh corn, some bacon, great started.  There were 4 of them.  There were other items I'd like to try, so many items on the menu sounded so good.  I had the Triple B Burger, it was good, but a bit drier than medium, I prefer mine a bit more pink.  The brioche was soft, nicely toasted, large tomato, two large slices of bacon, wished there was more Blackberry BBQ sauce, but it was good.  My mom had the grilled crab cake, it looked great.  My stepfather had the wildfire burger.  The fries were great, fresh cut, lightly salted, just the right amount of soft and crispy.  Nice selection of drafts.  I look forward to going there again.",

The dip was wonderful and spicy The overwhelming amount of sauce that came with the crab hush puppies was cold enough to crash the temp of the whole plate and turned it all lukewarm. The burger was under seasoned, and simply average. The grits were an absolute MESS. Shrimp was way overcooked and not deveined, grits were pulverized and had no texture or flavor to speak of, and the presentation was something more like skyline  hot dog chili than cheddar grits with a lovely sheen of grease floating on top.

We arrived about 20 minutes before they were going to close which is not uncommon for any restaurant. We were immediately greeted at the door and told they were closing so we needed to order right away. No Welcome to our restaurant or any type of cordial pleasantries. We set at the food bar which is a good portion of their seating. I ordered their street fair corn along with a  crab cake sandwich. The people behind the counter were nice but somewhat in a rush and seemed agitated. We received our food in a timely manner minus the corn which I never asked again because I figured they didn't want to cook it because it may take too long. The crab cake sandwich was excellent and highly recommend it. In my opinion, the overall experience was horrible. They should change their hours and close a half hour earlier but somehow they forgot they are  in the restaurant business. When I was a server many years ago we used to have customers come in 2 minutes before closing but the owner of the business was excited to have them in as they were paying customers and we're never rushed. What the rude person at the door didn't know was that I've been traveling 8 hours from Florida and was very hungry and waited to eat because this place was recommended. I would not go back ever.",

    "text": "My husband has been trying to get me to go here for the past 3 months and we finally got the chance to check it out last week. The location is a little bit off the beaten path but right next to Zeke's drive through made it very easy to find. Inside it's sort of an open concept with a grill/bar combo in the middle of the restaurant. Good draft list for beers and they serve an 8oz beer portion which may be just right for lunch. Some TVs could help this place be considered for local sporting events.  Regarding the food, we got some grilled cajun wings as an appetizer and these were the best part of the meal. Smoky flavor and good seasoning really added to these well cooked wings. My husband has been wanting to try a burger from here so he ordered the fireside (basic) burger and wanted it cooked medium. We've been to many places where it's been overdone so we were very hopeful. I got the wedge salad. The portions are a good size and the presentation is interesting (his burger came on a giant cutting board with really no sides to catch drips from the burger). However in this case the burger was actually undercooked and was actually on the rare side (cold inside). He was too much of a wimp to bother the waitress and send it back but it's always easier to cook more than to refire an overcooked burger. The fries were good!  My wedge salad was a little awkward as all the items came separate from the wedge of lettuce that the majority of these types of salads have already cut up and sprinkled on top of the lettuce. The items that came with it sounded good (tomato, avocado, egg) but they were all just basically halved and put on the plate next to the lettuce. The flavor was good but the bleu cheese dressing was not very good that I ordered in place of the ranch dressing it came with.  I am also giving this 3 stars because our table was wobbly and we had to fix it with a napkin and we looked over and another table had a tattered napkin underneath of one of the legs suggesting that these tables need some maintenance. Overall I would come back for happy hour and eat more apps/wings but would not come back for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "So after going a whole semester of being poor and eating at home, I was super excited to finally try out a new restaurant again. The Fire Side Public House, a tucked away spot behind the East Liberty Target which opened a few weeks ago, and a spot I could not wait to get my hands on it.  My friend J and I went on Monday evening before he takes off to South America for the holidays. Even before you enter the location, you get a bright invitation illuminating from its door, being covered in blue/white holiday lights around the roof and windows. I'm not sure if this is seasonally intended or just for sake of brightness, but either way I was happy to see it lit up.  Inside, your eye is immediately guided to the center of the restaurant, taken up by the large vent with Fire Side Public House proudly displaying over the wood fire island cooking station. From side view, along the length of the restaurant it's set up as follows: Left [front] is the large board of beers and cocktails, middle [under the vent] are the open prep, cooking/grilling and plating stations where you get a grand view of your food being charred and assembled, while you take in the intoxicating smells of the burgers and the skillets. On the right [back] there are a few tables for parties larger than two. The entire cooking island is ringed by bar space, always my favorite place to sit. Above you, there is breathtaking art of our favorite Steel City from various angles and in various sizes. It's easy to miss until you follow up the vent and see where it leads. I much like that they are able to use the otherwise neglected ceiling and altogether it leaves you with a comforting feeling of sitting around a big fireplace.  The beer list is sizable for this small space with local, regional and national microbrews on tap and in the bottle. On the other side of the drink menu you get a whole listing of seasonal specialty cocktails. Naturally right now they are holiday styled. I was really tempted to get the \"Santa, I know him!\" just for the name but I was trying to constrain myself as it was Monday. The menu is sleek and simple, but considering that I had prime view of everything that was being served, my mouth watered at everything. J and I had a skillet each, mine the Chicken Pasta, his the Blue corn shrimp and grits. Each looked great. The chicken sausage was hearty and the pasta done just right. Two mentions: The consistency was a little bit off for me, the basil infused cream was a bit on the milky side, having the effect of \"washing\" the pasta, rather than coating it as a sauce should. Also, it came off too delicate. The basil flavoring a bit lost and it definitely needed salt. I'm sure they skimped on the salt in favor of the basil and the sausage, but as none of the ingredients bonded together [not even with the help of the grated fontina cheese], I was definitely missing a bite.   The blue corn shrimp on the other hand looked awesome, and I was experiencing food-envy. It was served with three massive prawns and the grits were served good and hearty. I will be checking that out for next time. I hear it was good, despite him attempting to ruin it by drenching his food in hot sauce. [Sigh, that man cannot eat any food without hot sauce]  Lastly, it is very well priced for the quality and portion of food that you get. I'm happy to have walked away with a full but not overloaded feeling as even a carby pasta dish came off light even with a beverage you should be under the $20 dollar mark which is refreshing for the location and the fact that pittsburgh's more recent places are getting out of hand. [see other reviews]  All in all I am very pleased with my experience at FSPH, especially as it's close to my new home. I will definitely be coming back to try everything else on this menu and hopefully still before the the \"Santa, I know him!\" disappears from the menu.",

Checked this place out on a Saturday night. Wait staff very friendly and attentive. We had the chicken nachos, which have smoked chicken that isn't too over-powering and the Peanut butter burger. I can't say enough good things about the burger...the peanut butter had hints of a thai peanut sauce vs. standard pb. The grass fed burger was perfectly cooked and not at all greasy. Extensive list of craft beers on tap. And ample parking in a parking lot, which is so clutch for the area. Will absolutely be returning.",

If they fixed some simple cooking things and tightened up service, they could be a solid four stars.   The good: -solid beer list, very good prices, half size pours -parking! -cozy, albeit generic vibe   The not so good: -veggie burger was ice cold   -out of avocado (we both ordered things with avocado, weren't told until after the food came) -gave us the wrong beer  -took a long time for food to come out, despite being only half full - never got checked on afterwards  -the vent on the wood grill must not be strong enough - we were sitting a good distance away and came home smelling like a camp fire",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place since I live nearby and miss station street. The hostess was super friendly and pleasant. In fact the friendliness of the staff was one of the few bright spots today. Drinks: cocktail menu has fun names and a few standard drinks and some interesting mixtures. Unfortunate to see sours mix listed. Not really a place for a cocktail menu laden with high end ingredients,  but a nice menu worth a look and definitely something for everyone.  The draft beer selection has a lot of local and PA brews with some good seasonals.  They have a nice late night happy hour- $4 for any 16 oz beer below 7% abv.  The beer bottles seem overpriced, with a grapefruit sculpin coming in at 8.50. This is a good place for beers after 9 pm.   The service was odd. Beers and food came out strangely timed.. Almost one item at a time so one person sat with no drink or entree.    The food was alright. Some kitchen mixups resulted in one app being doubled and the other showing up very late. Disappointed by the wings overall and I left with a stomach ache.   Burger was way overcooked and things like small plates for appetizers and new forks were hard to come by.   Once they work out the kinks in the kitchen it might turnaround. We need something in the area,  so I am hooeful.    While the food was not the best tonight,  I might return because the staff was so nice and for the draft beer specials.",

    "text": "When the Station Street Hot Dog restaurant was located at 6290 Broad St in East Liberty, I visited the restaurant several times and I enjoyed their food.  The problem that I had with the restaurant is that the menu was very limited and to make a long drive for hot dog and fresh cut fries, although tasty, just wasn't worth it.  Additionally, paying $15 or so for said hot dog and fries just wasn't worth the effort.  Hey, I can go get a pack of high quality hot dogs and a couple of potatoes and feed a horde for the same price.  Would I have the same accoutrements?  Not necessarily, but close enough!  That leads me to the re-opening of the same space as The Fire Side Public House.  Now, my cousin told me that the new owners were having a \"soft opening\" and that I should get there quickly.  (I have been eyeballing the opening of this place for quite some time, so I hightailed it over there and I called my fellow Yelper Tim W. to let him in on the soft opening secret.)  The ambiance of the place is literally \"smoky hipster-chic\".  (They have a show kitchen centered around a Grillworks oven.   The owners also own Sidelines Beer House in Sewickley, which opened in 2012, and Sidelines Bar & Grille in Millvale, ) The menu includes sandwiches, burgers, small plates and entrees.  I have actually been to the restaurant/pub on two different occasions and they're barely open, so be a little patient with them.  On my first occasion, I had the grilled Siracha Maple Bacon wings and my daughter Muff had the Smoked Chicken Nachos as appetizers.  The wings were delicious and cooked perfectly.  My only complaint was that they actually came AFTER my entree.  (That's a timing issue that the chefs have to work out.)  My daughter enjoyed her nachos and I thought that they were good, but I think that they can be GREAT if they truly \"smoke\" the chicken ahead of time and then heat it/sear it right before serving.  Now to the entrees!  I had the Blue Corn Shrimp & Grits and my daughter had the Beer Glazed Citrus Chicken.  I am a shrimp & grit connoisseur!  The Fire Side's shrimp & grit dish was tasty.  Wood-fired Cajun seasoned shrimp over blue corn grits with an over easy egg?  Shoooot!  Sign me up!  Minor complaint?  Yes!  I love almost any type of shrimp in any form or fashion, but peeling grilled head-on shrimp after they have been \"stuck\" in grits is not a pleasant experience.  Lose the shrimp \"body\" shell, keep the head on and grill away! (They have another shrimp dish that is prepared similarly, \"Smoked Prawns\",that is better served by this style of preparation because the diner is not asked to dip their hands into grits to enjoy the shrimp.)  Muff's Beer Glazed Citrus Chicken needed a dose of additional seasoning/sauce to enhance the dish. The desserts that we had, Campfire S'Mores and Blueberry Cobbler served in cast iron pans were delicious.  The S'Mores dish needed a little more graham crackers and the chocolate needs to be placed on top of the crackers and not at the bottom of the pan. (Burned the chocolate in spots.)  Blueberry Cobbler?  Yummy!  They should change the cobbler seasonally.  On my second occasion, we had their signature Fire Side burger, Smoked Prawns, Beer Cheese & Bacon Fries and Chicken Skillet Pasta.  All of these dishes were decent and the service on both occasions was excellent.  I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant.  Was everything excellent?  No, but they are definitely heading in the right direction.  Once they tweak and refine a couple of the dishes, (E.g., The beer cheese sauce was way too thin) they will definitely be worthy of 5 stars, in my humble opinion.  They have all of the makings (I.e., Reasonable price points, tasty menu offerings, great service) of a five star pub, just give them a moment to get their bearings.  We need this type of place in the East End where you can leisurely enjoy tasty food and drinks without competing in expensive parking Olympics.",

    "text": "You will have that delicious wood burnt smell permeating your clothes when you leave. If you can't handle that, then this isn't the place for you.   My friend and I tried this place after being fans of Station Street and wanting somewhere with parking (yay!) and new to try. At first the hostess station can be misleading. There wasn't a designated hostess but a waitress who later sat us. We watched other people walk in with a similar reaction and seat themselves. The waitress who sat us said that the cocktail menu was correct but the beer menu was incorrect but the beer menu on our dinner menus was correct. However, my menu was misprinted completely so you couldn't tell what the first column of beer was.   The waiter was great; he was on top of all the errors and things left off the menu down to the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors in the menu. My friend and I split the nachos, beer cheese fries, and corn dip. 100% order the corn deep. It was excellent and a great portion for two. Not too cheesy and lots of flavor. The nachos are huge. Lots of roasted corn, chicken, and other toppings. Take a pass on the beer cheese fries. They were slightly cold and the cheese tastes off. The bacon was under coated. We ate the fries who did not have any toppings on them and they were fine.   I love to see what's new in East Liberty and I'm really glad to see the space being utilized. I think there are a lot of things that still need worked out. The beer menu, service, and decor is awesome. Probably not suitable for large parties over four people. I'd love to go back and give it another shot and update the rating.",

Fireside staff was extremely accommodating on not only a holiday weekend but a potential busy Valentines brunch hour. Giving us full claim to their back seating area for over two hours, they took great care of our party with drinks and appetizers. Highlights were the crab and bacon hush puppies, Korean buffalo wings and Gouda chicken mac. Perfect bloody Mary's and the \"Paint chip\" cocktail was delightful!The hamburgers were juicy and good grill flavor. Peach cobbler and Campfire s'mores skillets were excellent! Highly recommend coming in a large group or date night. Fireside will treat you right!!  (Free parking was added bonus)",

The restaurant is located in a weird place in East Liberty where it is somewhat separated from the rest of the restaurants located on Highland/Centre/etc. so you get a *lovely* view of the back of Target's parking lot and the busway lol.  Anyways, the food is absolutely wonderful and the draft list has many options of great beers. I ordered the Black and Yellow Burger which has bacon and caramelized onions on it. I think caramelized onions are literally made of crack so I thought the burger was absolutely delicious! In addition to having awesome burgers, FSPH has some of the best fries I've ever had too. I think they use some type of pepper or other spice but they do something to their fries that make them extra addictive!  The only issue I had with Fire Side was that the service was rather slow even for the non-busy night I went and that the server mixed up the beers me and the other person I came with ordered. Otherwise, I loved Fire Side Public House and I totally recommend. I'm looking forward to my next visit!",
