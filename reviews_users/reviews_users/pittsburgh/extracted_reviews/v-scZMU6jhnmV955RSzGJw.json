    "text": "Everyone's reviews are pretty spot-on and in general, this is a good place, with a friendly feel, and tasty sushi. But there are two things stopping me from giving this restaurant a better rating than \"A-OK.\"  1) There are usually around 4 sushi chefs behind the counter, quickly putting together orders. I don't know which one it is, but one of them uses WAY TOO MUCH rice for the rolls! This makes it difficult to eat the role in one bite because it's so bulky. I usually have to knock half of it off, and then my roll falls apart, and then, well, screw trying to dip it in soy sauce. They need to give more training to their chefs! 2) Why...WHY are the lunch specials ONLY rolls? Why is there never anything else as a special? Like a little combo box: a few of pieces of nigiri, a roll, miso soup and small salad.  For the two reasons above, I only go here when I'm limited on time because it's only a 5 minute walk from my work. Otherwise, you will see me at \"Sushi and Rolls\" in Oxford Centre!",

Enter No. 1 Sushi, a tiny little shop just outside of Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh, which serves some of the largest rolls filled with the freshest sushi that I've tasted, all at ridiculously low prices that keep me coming back.  Now, it helps that there's not much competition around, but No. 1 Sushi has really grown on me. After a few visits and a few different rolls, I settled on the Ichiban Roll and the Viagra Roll (yeah, I didn't ask either), which have the most amount of fresh fish per roll.  Add a bowl of miso soup or some edamame, and you will leave quite full. There's really few options that are better for lunch in downtown Pittsburgh.",

Everything in nicely presented and if you are ordering takeout the chef carefully places everything in the Styrofoam container. There is hardly any seating but if the weather is warm you can just walk to Market Square and use one of the public dining tables.  I've tried a couple of different rolls but usually come back to the spicy tuna and often get their specials (which change often, sometimes even in the middle of the day). I love the sauce they drizzle on the spicy tuna and the rice-to-fish ratio is perfect too. Lastly, the owners are very kind and seem to genuinely appreciate your business.   Bonus: they are open until 8 pm.",

    "text": "This place is tucked in a little side street beside Market Square.   After seeing a sign on the sidewalk advertising a reasonably priced ($10) sushi lunch special, I decided to give it a try.  The inside is small, but tastefully decorated with a few tables and a wall bar area.  I was immediately fond of the place simply because the woman taking orders and manning the register was SOOO NICE.  Seriously, she is ultra-friendly and was running around trying to help customers, get them more ginger, etc.  In a lunch area dominated by busy businessmen and women trying to get in and out as quickly as possible, with restaurant workers typically disinterested in providing good customer service, this was a refreshing change!  The lunch special came with two sushi rolls and a side salad.  It was a perfect lunch portion and honestly included more sushi than I had expected for the price.  The sushi was good.  Not mind-blowing, not terrible, but better than expected at the price and given the cost of doing business in that location.  In short - it's a solid lunch spot!    I'd happily go back and I really hope that they succeed.  If they keep providing such great customer service I have no doubt they will do well.",

So even though the name had changed a couple times, I was rather hesitant...  I shouldn't have been. I got the #3 special, which was a (spicy) tuna roll and (spicy) salmon roll with choice of soup or salad (i got salad) and it was excellent!! Plus only cost 12.95...  It was a very good spice level without compromising flavor, the fish tasted fresh and was good quality, and the portion was great (plenty of food). Not to mention the extremely personable staff.  I didn't try any of their more complex maki rolls, but saw some pass me after ordering and wondered if I should have... they looked great!

My wife and I were looking for vegetarian cut rolls and there are more choices here than any of the restaurants we regularly visit back in Southern California.  They are fast and the prices are extremely reasonable.  The Kampyo was very good.  The Avocado was just right.  One of the vegetable combination rolls comes with seaweed salad wrapped around it.  A must have if you are a vegetarian.  They even have Oshinko though it was not as outstanding as the rest.  We ordered lunch for 2 (with almost all the vegetarian choices) for under $30 and had enough left to take to the airport and eat as our dinner for our flight home.  In California it would have been $50 and nowhere near as tasty.  My goal is now to get our favorite Sushi place in California to add the Seaweed outer option to their vegetable combo roll.",

    "text": "I stopped by on Thurs. prior to seeing a musical at the Benedum for a quick and inexpensive dinner.  Upon initially passing by, I wasn't sure if they were open, since the \"Open\" sign was unlit and nobody was inside.  Having ensured that they're open until 8pm, I decided to take a chance, and walked in.  I was quickly greeted by a gentleman seated behind the counter.  Upon saying I hadn't been there before and asking him for a recommendation, he asked me what kind of fish I liked.  I told him I enjoyed salmon and tuna, and he pointed out the daily specials, one of which was a spicy salmon roll and California roll, and another of which was a spicy salmon roll and California roll, both of which came with a side of miso soup or a salad.  I decided to go with the first combo ($10.99 before tax), with the soup.  The soup, was served first, was on the salty side and wasn't super flavorful, but it was served nice and warm, and made for a nice starter on a cold and rainy evening.  The rolls were brought out about 10 min. after ordering, and I was pleasantly surprised that 10 of each type came with an order.  Of the two types of rolls, I'm definitely more a fan of the spicy salmon than the California.  The spicy sauces drizzled on the salmon rolls added a dose of zest, and the salmon itself added some nice color and flavor.  I found the California rolls rather bland--but then again, I'm not a big fan of California rolls in general due to their blandness.  I know many people like them, but I'm just not a fan, so it would have been nice if one of the specials came with something other than California rolls.  As it were, I was quite pleased with the amount of food I received for the price--for me, it was more than enough for dinner, let alone lunch.  As others have noted, this place does more of a take out business than eat in, but there is a counter as well as a few tables if you wish to eat in.  The man and woman who waited on me, who I'm guessing were the owners, were very friendly, asking me how everything was and even bidding me goodbye when I went to leave.  While I'd rate the food a solid 4, the value and great service push my rating up to a 4.5, making this one of the better sushi joints I've been to in PGH.",

My complaint about this place is hard for me to actually complain about because it's not actually a bad thing.

Not to say that you can't get pricier sushi here cause they do have a very full and diverse menu, but if sushi specials are your thing, this is the only place downtown that will fulfill your hunger.   My husband and I went in on a Wednesday at 11:30.  There were two people ahead of me in line and they quickly took our order and gave us the seaweed salads that came with our special.  They waited until we finished the delectable little salads before they brought over our sushi - which I wasn't expecting.  A lot of nice restaurants don't even give you time to finish your appetizer before they bring out the main course.  The sushi was beautifully presented in an albeit sad styrofoam container.  We both got the spicy salmon and the shrimp tempura special.  The salmon was sliced, not pureed which was lovely and fresh.  The shrimp tempura wasn't too hot which was good in the container.  It came with soy sauce, pickled ginger and a tiny spot of wasabi.  There was also a tiny mint in the container.   Surprisingly good quality fish in the heart of market square!",

But stopped here for lunch last week and ordered 8 pieces of sushi, a baby octopus salad, and a drink for $33. That's a ton to pay for lunch, but given the order it's about $3/piece of sushi, which is quite in the ballpark for most decent places.   I was surprised at how decent. The fish was fresh and at a nice temperature, and the rice was well cooked and seasoned. So it's not the most cheapo sushi place around (and...do you really want to go to that place considering it's raw fish we're talking about?) but Sushi Sushi is the real deal for what it is.",

Everyday, they offer 3-4 different rolls and each come with miso soup or salad, ranging from $9-$12. The quality of the fish is excellent. It's fresh, flavorful and they never use tempura as a filler. The lunch rolls typically = 12 pieces of sushi. I know that doesn't sound like a lot but the size of their rolls, plus the soup or salad is always plenty of food. Sometimes, I am able to make two meals out of a lunch special!   The restaurant itself is very small. They have a few tables inside but I recommend ordering takeout if you're heading over between 11-2. Their lunch rush is busy so sitting at a table means you'll probably have a mass of people standing around waiting for their orders, leaving little room for personal space.   Along with their sushi, they offer seaweed salad, octopus salad & house salad with ginger dressing. I've never had a bad meal!   The staff is friendly, fast and professional. My only complaint is that they do not have an active website or social media account (other than yelp) to advertise their daily specials. You either have to stop down in person or call.",

So worth the price, not that they are even that expensive. They were decent, although I thought the ichiban roll lacked some flavor.   Service here is fantastic. I ordered takeout and was greeted warmly. Felt no rush to order as the lady told me to take my time. After placing my order, she called me by my first name every time she spoke to me. After waiting for just a couple minutes, one of the sushi chefs came over to me to tell me that it'll be another few minutes before my sushi is done because they wanted to use fresher ingredients. The lady told me to take a seat as I waited and, five seconds later, brought me a bowl of hot miso soup to enjoy. How sweet! When my order was ready, she even took the extra step to clean the sauce that was stuck to the bottom of the styrofoam box before putting it into the bag. She and the sushi chef both apologized for the wait and thanked me for waiting, even though it only took about 10-12 minutes. Really was not expecting such great service for just ordering takeout.

    "text": "This is a small place located on a side street of Market Square. They sell nothing but sushi, miso soup, a few small salads (anyone up for an octopus salad?) and drinks. Think sushi with a fast food approach.    The dining area seats 11 people and the seats aren't very comfortable. I think the idea is to get you in and on your way as quickly as possible which would be fine on a nice day when you can relax and enjoy your lunch outside in Market Square.  Today I got the special:  California roll and salmon roll with the miso soup. The soup was tasty and I enjoyed both rolls; it was definitely worth the $11.72 that I spent on it. Actually it was more food than I really wanted and I ended up wasting about half a roll.  I really would have been satisfied with just one roll.  Chalk it up as a sushi rookie mistake... I never think that this stuff will fill me up and I'm always surprised when it does.   My only real knock on No1. Sushi Sushi is that the chopsticks that I got were warped -- I tried two different sets. It's not so much a big deal for me, I'm relatively proficient when it comes to chop sticks but I could see a newbie could get frustrated quickly.",

I also ordered spicy salmon $5.95. Prices were on par with other sushi restaurants in my opinion.   The rice was cooked well and the fish tasted fresh. I didn't give this place five stars because the spicy mayo and spicy sauce was a lot...too much. I ended up scraping off some of it.   Overall it was a good meal with a minor hiccup.  I also want to add that this establishment is very friendly and personable.  I was in and out in ten minutes.",

They have three different sushi combo specials everyday that come with two rolls and a side of miso soup or seaweed salad. I have tried about a dozen of their different rolls and I have thoroughly enjoyed each one, and their miso soup is some of the best I've had in the city.  I can only recommend this place as a takeout counter though; they have seating on the inside but it is limited and cramped. However, their service is prompt even during lunch rush, so it's easy to grab and go. Just don't count on parking in the area as it is primarily reserved for foot traffic.",

The restaurant itself is tiny.  Just a few small tables and a high top area.  I would guess a large portion of their business is take out.  For a small restaurant, they have a fairly large number of food options.  In addition to the menu, they also have several grab and go options available.   The menu features typical sushi features (like the California roll and dynamite roll, for example) but then also have creations custom to them.  I tried a daily special of a shrimp tempura roll and a spicy tuna roll.  It came with a small side of either seaweed salad or soup.  I chose the seaweed salad and enjoyed having the extra bit of food along with my sushi.  Both rolls that I ordered were a nice size with rice that was a perfect consistency and packed with flavor.  The order also came out extremely quickly.   Staff was courteous and efficient and food was tasty.  I'll definitely be back.",

They have an extensive menu of your typical run-of-the-mill rolls as well as a good selection of specialty rolls (with some very, uh, unique names).   The vegetarian options are definitely more varied than other sushi take-out spots I've seen so I was pleasantly surprised. I went for two of the vegetarian specialty rolls: Veggie Lover and Green Monster (both around $8 a roll). Personally, I would recommend the Green Monster if you're looking for a hearty veggie roll. The Veggie Lover was simply bland and tasteless. Neither were extraordinary by any means, but hey, you get what you pay for.",

I honestly don't remember all the rolls I ordered but I think it was 5 in total and they put it on a great platter for me to take. The sushi is very very good and fresh, not the absolute best I ever had which is the only reason I couldn't do 5 stars.   Super friendly staff and very clean place. Absolutely will go often!",

No no no no. Why?  I couldn't eat it. They covered it in different sauces and put barely any fish in there and then once you threw in the pickled jalapenos, I just couldn't stomach it. They seemed nice enough there. Maybe other rolls are better. I just prefer good fish with fresh veggies and not all the sauce and preserved junk.",

No Weekends : (  Staff: Warm, receptive and will remember your and your order if you become a regular. They will ask your name for the order and no matter how busy, they work hard but keep composure with the cashier always easy to talk to.  Sushi: It's my objective to try every roll that they have but that will be a while. They have many selections and roll sizes. They have party options and catering available. Their rolls are served rice on outside but let them know and they can change that. Wasabi/Ginger/Soy sauce will always be in your to-go order so don't shake your container around unless you enjoy ginger all over your sushi. They have miso, seaweed salad and other menu options as well.  Drinks: The options are awesome. They have cans/bottles of soda, Snapple, Red Bull of all sizes and fair priced, teas and traditional Asian drinks.   Overall: Great sushi downtown, can become a tight space during lunch hour so I suggest going outside of 11a-1:30p. Yami Yami roll is a good start for those who haven't experienced raw fish sushi. The menu is a bit hard to read and on the wall. Grab a paper menu and sit down before ordering, there will always be a daily special on the chalk board. Enjoy",

It's a small unassuming establishment, limited in seating, but super in friendly service.    So I ordered the 15 piece Sashimi (number 91 on the menu).

All orders are made to order and they have a constant rotation of sushi specials.  Lunch is packed and it will be hard to find a place to seat. Dinner is usually pretty slow, but still enough people cycling through.   Everything is very fresh, comes served in a to-go/styrofoam box topped with wasabi, ginger, soy sauce, and a fruit candy.   Their rolls come with 6-8 pieces and are larger than most sushi places I've been to.  Two rolls are usually very filling. I highly recommend the yellow tail scallion roll or their spicy tuna/salmon rolls.",

Given that there aren't many tables and the counter you can sit at is relatively small, I doubt that I personally would plan on eating in No. 1 Sushi Sushi itself - at least not during the lunch rush.   That said, my order was so good I would definitely consider carrying another meal out at some point! The quality of the food - gyoza and a surprisingly fresh rainbow roll - was better than I expected and left me more than satisfied. Reading about other specials available here makes me want to come back for more fresh fish, too. I went with what my gut wanted during my last visit, but this girl could definitely change her mind and order if the price of the daily special was right!  My only criticism would be that the sushi did not maintain its shape (i.e. the roll began crumbling) as I ate it. I use the word criticism loosely here because I have no problem eating sushi with my hands, so I was able to keep my rolls from falling apart too much. Still, if someone were more of a hands-off eater, they might be disappointed that their sushi rolls didn't stay in one piece when picked up by chopsticks.  Still, the overall quality of my meal left me impressed and happy. I will definitely keep No. 1 Sushi Sushi in mind during future trips downtown - with reasonable prices and tasty options available here, I'm more than willing to walk down to Market St. for a sushi lunch!",

The sushi itself was good but not super filling for me, as I was very hungry. The prices were decent for sushi, $5-12 depending on what's in it and how many rolls. I got a double roll (12 pieces total) with a california roll and a salmon roll for about $9.  It's a good location, in the center of downtown. It is also in a walkable distance from point state park.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a quick small bite of sushi!  tldr; food 4/5 price 5/5 service 5/5 timeliness 5/5 location 5/5",

    "text": "Look, the idea of eating raw fish when your city is sandwiched between two rivers with unbelievably disgusting pasts isn't always pleasant... but if you know where to go, a purging of the mind is possible with some excellent quality.  Aside from Andy's sushi stand at Wholey's, I frequent No. 1 more often than any other.  They always recognize me and remember my name, either from frequency of my patronage or because I have a significant beard that is burned into their memory.  Either way, it's appreciated and they are always pleasant.  It's close to the office, it's relatively quick, and the variety is great... even if they pander to the yinzers by way of dressed up California rolls with Pittsburgh names for a few items, one of which contains cream cheese.  Filth like that should be named after the Monongahela, but I digress.    This review is not for the specials, nor any particular roll, but more so the general satisfaction they provide with their sushi.  Crispy salmon skin rolls are simple but well executed, the green monster is a great vegetarian option with nice texture contrast (albeit pieces are giant and make it somewhat difficult to maintain a pristine facial shrub), the spicy eel and avocado has a great balance of flavors, and the overall variety of fish gives you an endless bounty of options to help you dip your toes in the deep end.  In addition, the seaweed salad is always eaten on the side.  Forget the iceberg mix and ginger dressing... you can eat salad like that at home.  Expand your horizons and get more nutrients.  The seaweed is bright, crunchy, salty, and a little nutty from the toasted sesame seeds.  Oh, that neon green hair of a deep sea angel, be still my heart.  As long as they're slingin' fresh fish in my work neighborhood, I'll be going back at least every other week.  There aren't many places I'd feel safe eating sushi in this city, but I'm glad one of them is right down the street.",

Really convenient location but super easy to walk right by without even knowing you passed it!  There is a sign out front and they have a board with specials set up on the sidewalk, but the actual restaurant is super tiny, which really doesn't matter, but I can imagine that it gets a little cramped in there during busy times.  Either way, the food is really good and the people who work there are really friendly.  You can eat in or take out and they allow you to call ahead with a take out order which is convenient.
