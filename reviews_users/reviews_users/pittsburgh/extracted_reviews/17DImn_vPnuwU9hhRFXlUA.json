    "text": "Cool concept with beautiful design, although the space is super small so be prepared to be very close to your neighbors. The decor is immaculate, and they have a cool open kitchen bar area where you can watch some of the food prep.  The food was good, albeit pricy. It's a nice authentic Japanese izukaya addition to Pittsburgh, where most Asian restaurants somehow manage to serve a fusion menu Chinese/Japanese/Thai. Highly recommended the takuyaki and the shiitake mushroom skewer, those were by far the best things we tried. The chirashi bowl was pretty good, and let's you sample each fish shashimi in one dish. The karaage was a little disappointing, not a lot of seasoning/flavor and the steak skewer was meh. There's still lots on the menu that I want to sample!   The drinks were really good and the service was flawless, which is impressive for a new restaurant. Will definitely be back, maybe for some late night eats.",

For the past 2 months that I've been working in PIT, Umami has been a staple order for me through Postmates - I love the freshness of the ingredients and the sheer deliciousness of everything.   Umami can perhaps be called a more fusion-y take on japanese food, but not in a tasteless or odd way that fusion food often ends up. I haven't had a bad dish at Umami. though I will say their ramen is not amazing, so maybe order another one of their many amazing dishes on the menu instead.   --Yaki udon - my fave dish. I could eat this everyday. Al dente udon noodles with a perfectly cooked onsen egg, dried mushrooms, chili powder, shaved beets, and lots of cabbage. This is the type of meat less fish I could eat all the time. The mix of tastes and ingredients made this comfort food.  --Chawanmushi - only truly legitimate Japanese restaurants serve chawanmushi, and I was pleasantly surprised at this. It's served with thin slices of pumpkin and scallions on top, and is so smooth and not too salty.  --Temaki - I loved the salmon or the unagi ones. The unagi here is heavier and saltier than the usual types, with thick sauce covering it. I appreciate how the seaweed is crisp and the servings of rice is generous.  --Okonomoyaki - ive tried this at other teppanyaki places and it's a little different here - a little saltier especially with the bacon slices and mayo on top. But so delicious, and fried to a crisp at all the right parts. I loved the crunch of the cabbages in the pancake.  --others like takoyaki, nigiri etc...they've all been really good.   It can get pricey if you order the small dishes, so maybe that's why it's not 5 stars yet for me.   The atmosphere is also modern, young, like a hip bar, with great happy hour specials. I recommend making a trip here in person, not just ordering it online!",

    "text": "This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Hands down. One thing you must know is that if you wanna go at normal dinner times on a weekend, you must get a reservation. This place is small and very, very popular.   It is located on top of Round Corner in Lawrenceville. The entrance is around the corner on 38th, pull on the dragon handle and go up the stairs. The bar tends to be pretty busy, but their drinks are balanced and well thought out. I've gone on two occasions, one with another couple, where we ended up sitting across from where the grill is located on the bar. Although it was really neat to see, it was really, really hot. Like so hot, we were switching seats.  The second visit we were in the private room with a large party of 11.   Anyway for drinks I ended up ordering the Wolf and Cub which is a beer with a side of sake with a dropper of hibiscus syrup. It was delicious. For starters I highly recommend their skewers, and honestly they are so cheap, it is totally worth it. I recommend the bacon wrapped quail egg, the pork belly, the kabucha pumpkin and the meat ball skewers. And yes, I had all of those skewers. Not to mention my husband and I ordered 4 of them. Granted the skewers are small, but pack some incredible taste. Also I had a taste of the savory pancake, which was pretty tasty. It had bacon, cabbage and some other deliciousness, also highly recommend to share.   For our entree, I ordered their Tonkotsu Ramen, which came with a delicious marinated egg. Gotta have the egg... It was a good ramen, but not mind blowing good. Those skewers were....   Overall, for a restaurant that has small plates in their menu, this is a total bang for your buck. I love this place and I look forward to more of those meatballs.",

Just a red glowing sign with just japanese characters on the outside, it looks like a residence.  Then you're faced with two nondescript wood doors, like a choose your adventure game.  You then trek up two flights of narrow stairs into a completely different world.  The ambiance is super cool, with the lowered tables.   My friend raved about the robotayaki, but I found it to be slightly underwhelming.  On the other hand, the Takoyaki (octopus balls) and the Nasu Shigiyaki (eggplant) were phenomenal.  I also ordered the matcha slushee and it was one of the prettiest drinks I've ever seen.  My friends got the chirashi bowl and found it to be good, but pricey for the portion size and they left hungry.",

    "text": "Sushi cravings are inconvenient in Pittsburgh. I wanted a hand roll. So that limited my options. I decided to give Umami a try because I was truly in need of raw fish.   AMBIENCE B- Yikes. I kept looking around to see if anyone looked liked they belonged in that strange atmosphere, and I can't say anyone did. We went on a weeknight without a reservation and were seated at the bar. I had a prime view of a glass display case of precut fish. The place had neon lights and an indoor grill that accommodated the few hot food items. The only other time I've been so bombarded by an Asian neon stereotype is when Hot for Chicken was open in Ktown. But that place billed itself as a hangout. This place was not that.  SERVICE A- It was fine, the guy was nice enough but considering we were ordering small plates as we ate, he didn't come around quite enough and so dinner lasted forever.  DRINKS A- I ordered the ginger ginger which was fine. Tasty and not too sweet. But it was tiny.  APPETIZER A- I insisted on getting appetizers so we didn't have to declare bankruptcy from our sushi needs. So we got the takoyaki, which again, was fine. Are you starting to see a theme?  MAIN COURSE A- There were multiple rounds of nigiri and a salmon hand roll, which set us back enough that I threatened to fly to LA next time I wanted sushi. The fish was fresh enough and a decent quality. The hand roll was as expected. Everything was...Fine.  DESSERT I cannot for the life of me remember if I had dessert.   So in conclusion, this satisfied my sushi cravings for a total of 48 hours, after which I found myself needing it again. Was it worth it? Maybe?",

The food that we had was good. My favorite was the ramen bowl.   Here's the thing. For this type of place, you really need a server who will make suggestions, explain things, and ask you what you like, to really give you the full experience. Unfortunately, we explained that we had never been there before and that wasn't enough of a cue for her to explain things. She looked like she just wanted to take our order and not be bothered. As we looked at the menu, she came back and saw that we had several questions, but never made suggestions, and almost made us feel like she was judging us for our questions.   At the end of the meal she just brought us the bill, and we had planned to stay for a couple of drinks.  Oh well, we just went across the street to Grapperia, where they were happy to explain things and serve us.   Lackluster experience solely on our server. Prob wouldn't go back.",

Entering the restaurant was an experience by itself, as it's upstairs on the 3rd floor of the building that Round Corner Cantina is located.  The red lighting both on the way up and inside the restaurant itself gave it a surreal vibe that I thought was really cool.  The menu is basically set up as shareable and small sized plates.  The Robotayaki skewers were alright, but the items that shined for me were the larger plates, namely the Nash Shigiyaki (eggplant) and the Karaage (fried chicken).  Both were larger in portion than I expected and absolutely tasty in their own regard.  I wish I would have been more in the mood to eat here, as I was looking forward to place for weeks until 60s weather in February came around and day drinking happened.  Really looking forward to going back with a clearer mind and a larger appetite.  It is such a cool spot with a fun menu and highly recommended to those looking for a unique dining experience.",

I would order a little differently next time as I think their sashimi and hand-rolls are a little overpriced based on my experience at other places around the city. The quality was great and I enjoyed the salmon sashimi and striped bass handroll we ordered, but I'd focus more on the Yatai menu next time since those options are a little more unique.  My boyfriend and I split an order of the Miso Ramen (with extra noodles) because we heard the portions were huge. And they are! The ramen had crispy chili, edamame, nori, scallions and mushrooms. We added two Nitamago, which are soy-marinated poached eggs that you absolutely must add. It was SO delicious. The broth was very hearty and the mix of flavors was addictive. We finished the whole bowl despite being full about half-way through.  With our food and two drinks each (2 beers, sake and some Japanese whiskey), our bill came to just under $90. If you are looking to keep it cheap, skip the drinks and you can totally get a reasonably priced and filling meal here.",

I have never had Japanese street food before so this was a great introduction to it. Between the two of us, we had the plain onigiri, the tuna onigiri, the takoyaki (essentially octopus fritters), nasu shigiyaki (japanese eggplant with chicken) and the chicken hearts cooked on the grill.   The plain onigiri was pretty meh, I would probably suggest getting the tuna one as my friend thought his had a lot of flavor comparatively to mine.   Both the takoyaki and nasu shigiyaki were really good! The takoyaki was crisp on the outside and more chewy on the inside served with shredded beets. The Nasu dish was simple, slightly sweet, but very good!  As for chicken hearts - YOLO and go for it. If you get over the texture it's really not bad ;)  Next time, I am definitely going to check out their drinks!",

    "text": "The place- I felt like a VIP, sneaking in the back door, leading myself up a staircase, following the sounds of a live DJ on a Thursday evening at 7pm. This little hot spot is full of vibes. Good vibes. Hipster and non hipsters alike unite under the dimly red lit skinny tables. The staff is well oiled and put together, the open kitchen is fun to watch from afar - the expediter being key to shipping out dishes in a timely and orderly manner.  The drink- Large drink menu, limited by a night out prior, one of us had a cocktail and the other had a Lone Wolf & Cub (8 oz beer and sake pour). Both were above par delicious and creative.  The food- I tend to shy away from most food on a stick, but was convinced by my dining partner to at least share his robatayaki. Boy am I glad I did, the wagyu beef tenderloin was melt in your mouth fantastic. Chicken skin, crisp and salty. And the bacon wrapped quail egg was a burst of breakfast satisfaction in my mouf. Just as we finished those, the octopus balls appeared. Highly raved about online, they were octopus fritters with large pieces of meat in them with a parade of sauces over, under, around and through. They were delicious nuggets and great to share. Next up was the savory pancake - cabbage, brussel sprouts, bacon, yam and dried tuna flake highlighted this number, cooked crispy and covered in more mystery saucy goodness. It is a large 'small plate' be aware. To finish the meal came the pork & shrimp shumai. Served at the perfect temperature, filling with a satisfying mouth feel, these may have been my top choice of the night (sans wagyu stick). They came with a dumpling sauce and each had a single edamame tucked into it's hat.  The sweets- Fried ice cream, not your traditional Chi-Chi's set up. But vanilla ice cream encased in mochi then coated and fried. I didn't realize that would be the arrangement and I am not a fan of mochi in general - so I can't fairly judge the dish. But a lot of people were ordering it!  What would give it 5 stars? Knock a buck off cocktails, make the smaller plates smaller and cheaper, but otherwise, nicely done! I think I found a new date night hang out! Thanks Umami!",

    "text": "I am always up for trying new Asian restaurants and I can honestly say Umami did not disappoint. First, I would like to point out that if you are not into climbing 3 flights of stairs this may not be the place for you. These stairs are STEEP and after a few drinks it could get dangerous. It isn't a very large place and I could see it filling up rather fast around dinner time. My friend and I arrived around 4:15 and we were the first ones there. They have high top table seating only, so if you are not into that this also may not be the place for you.   For our drinks we ordered the tickle n giggle. Which is basically a Japanese take on a mojito. I personally wouldn't get this drink again, but it seems to be pretty popular here. The menu is izakaya style, so you order little bits at a time. I highly recommend the robatayaki. I ordered the pork belly and beef tenderloin. Both were glazed with tare, which is like a sweet soy sauce. I also ordered the Japanese fried chicken with gravy. This was probably my least favorite out of everything we ordered, but I still enjoyed it very much. They give you a lot of chicken for it being small bites. My friend and I shared the pork and shrimp shumai, which is an open faced dumpling. There was a total of 6 dumplings and each were stuffed very generously with pork, edamame and shrimp. The next dish we shared was the yaki udon. This came with egg, mushroom dashi, shiitake mushrooms, scallion, and barrel aged soy. The udon noodles were cooked just right and all of the flavors melded together perfectly.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try Japanese street food. It is totally worth every penny for the amount of food you get.",

I also suggest that you order a few items to share as this feels very dim sum/tapas style. We ordered the chirashi bowl and all pieces were great and fresh) the salmon a bit disappointing however, not as soft as I'd like for it to be). The octopus balls were also wonderful and definitely unique! My favorite may have been the pork belly skewer, however. Also, the cocktails were so cute and creative! All in all, the piece at the end felt very reasonable to. While ordering it seems quite pricey but you really do get the best bang for your buck if you share plates!",

From what the hostess said (dinner tables were reserved up until 1130pm) you def need a reservation on busy nights. Rookie mistake but we got lucky and beat most of the dinner traffic. The music was GREAT. The bartenders were fun and super helpful. I throughly enjoyed my dinner. My friends got the Ramen, fried chicken and sushi. I grabbed the deviled eggs () open faced dumplings and the salmon collar special. All of which, I'd most definitely get again!",

    "text": "I FINALLY made it down to Umami, and after eating there... DO NOT WAIT. It's super delicious and absolutely worth the price.  We went with some friends and ordered a ton of food while sitting at the bar.  Pros: The pork AND vegetable Gyoza was bomb-diggity bomb.  The edamame was prepared perfectly and just the right amount of salt as well.  My cocktail (7-night stay - Wray & Nephew Jamaican white rum, Kai lychee vodka, coconut lemongrass nigori, lychee calpico, lime) was absolutely gorgeous, edible flower anyone?, and tasted divine.  We got the spicy scallop hand roll, spicy tuna hand roll, and some octopus.  Friends ordered the fried/crispy chicken which I tasted and LOVED.  The service was awesome, the girl at the bar slinging our drinks was pleasant and sweet. She was helpful and seemed to genuinely enjoy what she was doing.   Cons: Seating is slim! So keep that in mind, it's not a great place for a large group of people but definitely great for a date.  The Miso soup is sweet, I mean candy sweet. I didn't think it was bad but our friends did not love it. It vaguely tasted like pineapple(?) if that makes sense. It was definitely heavier on the sweet than savory side. The waitress took it off my friends bill, and said she hadn't tasted it today but that it normally skews a little sweet. So take that as you will.   I'd definitely go back here and actually look forward to it!",

    "text": "Overall, we had a great night here once we figured it out.   It's different, for sure, but a nice concept and I'd definitely go back.   For starters, the service was excellent - our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt.   She took the time to explain everything on the menu and overall did a great job.    About that menu though.   I recommend that you scroll through the photos on Yelp because you can't really picture the dishes with the menu descriptions otherwise.  The menu has great variety and is well suited toward a tapas style meal.  You can mix and match a bunch of different things for a fun and satisfying meal.  We sampled a bunch of dishes and shared bites...several of the Robotayaki (yummy little barbeque skewers), both types of gyoza (super crispy dumplings), the salmon handroll (absolutely delicious), Takoyaki (octopus balls - crispy outside and soft inside - yum!), the okonomiyaki (a friend pancake of goodies), and the miso ramen (good, but I liked all the other stuff better).   We finished with both desserts - highly recommend the fried ice cream.   Overall, the food was top notch - even if we weren't entirely sure what we were ordering.     The atmosphere of the place was nice as well, though be prepared for a few things.   First, it's hard to find, as many other yelpers have said.  The door is on the side street around from Round Corner.   You go in and are faced with two more doors - go straight.  Then up BOTH steep flights of stairs and there you have it.  Once you are up there, the space is pretty small.  We were seated in a room off the left - the Japanese style with a hole in the floor.  Ladies - this is a place for pants since getting up and down off the floor in a skirt can be a little less than graceful.         They did not appear to have a ton of seating, so I'd say that a reservation is the way to go.",

We were seated at a high table that was close to the open kitchen so we had a good view. The place has a great late night dinner vibe, with a DJ starting to play music shortly after we were seated. We ordered the sashimi platter, hand rolls, grilled whole fish, grilled chicken and pork belly skewers, okonomiyaki, and mushroom ramen. We particularly enjoyed the handrolls, whole fish, skewers, and okonomiyaki. It's a great place to order a few things and share, ideally between two people. Prices were very reasonable for the quality and preparation that you get. Service was good throughout. We can't wait to go back and try more offerings. Definitely make a reservation before you go, as the wait time was 1.5 hours when we went.",

There was clearly a high level of attention being paid to everything that went out of ther kitchen.  We got one of their sashimi bowls to share and their fish special.  This place seemed so authentic I was afraid to ask for American utensils but did not want miss out on the amazing roasted veggies on the fish dish. So fresh and flavorful. It was amazing. The presentation of the sashimi was on point. We enjoyed everything we ate. We also got an alcoholic and tea drink. Their drink menu is as unique and transformative as the rest of our experience.

The skewered, grilled pork meatballs are rapidly becoming an obsession, and the dumplings remain a standout.

It seemed like a lot of it was in the accents (pop rocks, a matcha stick, etc.) that was fun but didn't ultimately make the drink. We started with the wagyu beef (overdone, not very flavorful, kind of chewy), the eggplant (cooked fine but again, not very flavorful) and the unagi sashimi (excellent) plus their special of the night, fried oysters (also excellent- lightly breaded, still nice inside). Next we shared the miso deviled eggs (my cousin and I loved them, my husband wasn't a fan), the nasu shigiyaki (tasty but also extremely salty and difficult to figure out initially - it kind of crumbled when we tried to cut it up to share) plus the pork and shrimp shumai (tasty but nothing mind blowing). We finished with a bowl of the Yaki udon which was my favorite item of the night. It was salty, savory, the egg was perfectly cooked and it was just such a warming, filling dish. I would go back for a bowl of the udon or get takeout, but I don't think this is a place we would go back to for a full meal like we did. Despite taking our server's recommendations we were disappointed by most of it. Good, but not exceedingly so.",

What an incredibly rude thing to say before seating people!  The food was ok. The waygu skewers were very good. Sushi was ok, nothing special, same with the ramen nothing special. Because the staff is so awful and pretentious there, I probably won't go back. The food and atmosphere weren't anything wonderful either. Very disappointed.",

The rice ball is smaller than normal but super pricy for $5-$6 per piece. Fried chicken is the worst even not considering real Japanese food standard. The chicken is pre-cooked and over-fried with too much flour. If you tried fried chicken at Chaya, you'll definitely feel the difference. Even teppanyaki Kyoto is much better than this place. It's definitely cheating to label itself as a Japanese izakaya. Pls visit any Izakaya in New York for a real Japanese dining experience.",

These are usually just simple , nothing special starters but in this case the ingredients where amazing. The miso was extraordinary with seaweed that actually had flavor and tofu that was tender and tasty not squares of tasteless rubber.  When I commented on this, my wonderful server (Christine?) told me they actually make their own tofu!  The pork dumplings also were unique in the way they were joined together and pan fried with very crispy edges.  They come with a light dipping sauce that perfectly complimented the ingredients in the dumplings.  The fried chicken I had for my main course was also quite good but I was not a fan of the gravy.  So I said something and my waitress brought out the dipping sauce they serve with their tempura dish and some fresh chiles.  I added some heat and started dipping away.  Yummmm!  All I have say is thank you guys! What an unexpectedly great late night dinner.",

Ordered the deviled eggs and the pancake.  Both were good, interesting flavors,  close to 4 stars.    I ordered the udon and my both ordered the tonkatsu ramen, add chili.  The udon was pretty good, 3 stars.  Knife cuts on the veg were very small so difficult to eat with a chopstick with the thick/heavier udon noodle.  One of my friends got the unagi hand roll and thought that was the best hung we ate (\"bomb.com\").  The ramen deserves its own paragraph.  To levelset, we just got back from Japan and that is my standard. Regardless, I am beyond confused why some think this ramen is the best ramen in Pittsburgh.  The ramen broth was inedible. Basically drinking ocean water.  I guess some are considering that flavor? The meat on the bone is difficult to incorporate into the ramen with chopsticks.  It is nothing like the tonkatsu ramen we had in Tokyo and I will never be back for it.  Negative stars.    Overall giving 3 stars because appetizers were ok and our bartender did end up taking the ramen off of the menu.",

    "text": "I visited Umami when I first moved to Pittsburgh.  While the restaurant gave a fun izakaya vibe, I thought some of the food items were lacking.  I recently visited (a whole year late) and had a better experience.  One of the things I like about Umami is the late Friday and Saturday hours.  The restaurant itself is compact, nested on the third floor where Cantina is.  The entrance is on the side street though.  It was a bit hard to find it during the evening.  It's almost like a izakaya speakeasy! I like what their drink menu offers.  The specialty drinks are well-priced and easy to drink.  Another thing I like about Umami is the serving size.  It's not one of those restaurants where my stomach cries over how small the portions are.  For a party of two, their appetizer size are pretty big to share.  This time, we ordered the chawan mushi, chirashi, tonkotsu ramen, and some handrolls.  I did not like the tonkotsu ramen a year ago.  The bamboo shoot was overpowering the broth.  The broth in tonkotsu ramen is key, and they didn't deliver it.  Since Umami owner is a co-founder of Ki Ramen, I figured to give the ramen a try again.  I LOVE THE TONKOTSU RAMEN THIS TIME AROUND!  The broth isn't very salty but fatty enough.  My favorite part was the bone in cha siu.  I'd come back to Umami for that alone.  The chirashi has a beautiful presentation and good quality fish.  The handrolls were decent, but a little pricier and not much different than other places.  The chawan mushi egg was silky and smooth.  I'd love to come back and try the rest of the menu next time.  Now that I discovered some stand out items, it makes me want to revisit.",

It's in a slightly hidden upstairs area with a nondescript entrance, and once you enter, the decor and dim lighting make you feel like you're in a different world.   I liked this place because there's a little something for everyone, whether you want a fun cocktail, robata, sushi, or heartier Japanese food.   We had a wide variety of dishes including he shrimp skewers ($2.50 each), salmon and yellowtail sashimi (very fresh!), the Nashu Shigiyaki (eggplant with ground chicken and other goodies on top - a bit salty from what I can remember), and a special of the night which was a messy but very flavorful and well-cooked short rib over rice. I washed all of this down with a cocktail called the 7 Day Vacation, which I no longer see on the cocktail menu online but I mostly chose because of the fun tiki glass presentation. It was pretty sweet and actually stronger than I expected (maybe because I downed it before the food actually arrived), but it came with a fun purple bendy straw so there's that!   Coming from NYC restaurant prices I thought it was actually a pretty good value from start to finish, and the service was on point as well. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone with a jones for Japanese fusion dining.",

The doors weren't clearly labeled so I felt like I was about to barge into someone's living room. Once we finally navigated our way up to the restaurant, we were seated at the bar because the space is sooo limited plus we were there on a Saturday night with no reservation - oops.   Vegetarian items are all clearly labeled which was a huge help considering I had no idea what half the ingredients listed were. It could've been a fish or a mushroom - no clue. I ordered the vegetarian rice ball (onigiri) because I've never tried one and it looked pretty darn good in Pokemon. Either I was was being a huge baffoon or it was poorly made because it fell apart as soon as I tried to eat it. It was delicious but it could've used more filling. For my main entree, I ordered the donburi with tofu and it was incredible. Huge portion and packed with so many toppings and flavors. They were a little too heavy handed with the sauce which was overbearing at times, but otherwise, it was amazing. 100% recommend!",

I decided to take my boyfriend there since I was craving quality sushi, particularly chirashi. It's hard to find good quality sushi in any city, and I was still feeling a bit bummed that the Izakaya place I used to go to in Shadyside changed over to a ramen shop. (I heard it's still pretty good though, but no sushi at the new place.) So I ended up trying to make a reservation here, and probably a mistake to try to do it the night before Thanksgiving, but oh well. I was craving chirashi like nobody's business! We ended up just walking in and sitting at the bar. We arrived right when happy hour started so there were plenty of seats. They have two different house sakes. I recall trying both and feeling pretty meh about one, but loving the other. I wish I had remembered the name of the one I liked because I would totally try to buy some at a liquor store if possible! That's how good it was. The chirashi was truly amazing here. I wish they had had uni in stock but they didn't have any because it wasn't available or fresh enough, and I can respect that. I love how they serve the soy sauce in a pipette sticking out of the rice, though I had to ask for a second one. Everything about it was amazing... the quality and freshness of the fish, the presentation, etc. Service was friendly but not overly friendly or fast. It seems kind everyone has a kind of laid back attitude there. It was pretty chill. Very limited seating so be sure to book several days in advance especially if it's a busy time of year. Otherwise, if you want a seat, be prepared to arrive early for happy hour. The entrance to this place is kind of hard to find at first also. And you have to walk up like 3 flights of stairs to get there. I did not mind this (plus they have epic wallpaper on your way up) but I am confused as to how handicapped folks would get up there as I did not see an elevator anywhere? Definitely not an accessible friendly place, also b/c they seemed to have multiple high top tables and high bar stools but no lower tables, so not sure how someone in a wheelchair would be able to eat here, unfortunately. The bathrooms are also down 1 level, accessible via the staircase which is somewhat inconvenient. I can only imagine how many drunken hipsters have taken a tumble down there on their way to the loo, haha. I loved the decor in this place more than anything, and that includes the stairwell wallpaper and the AMAZING dragon head faucet in the bathroom. I must try to find where they bought that so I can get one for my house, cause it is just that cool. Anyway, I would totally come back here again (actually did one more time before I went back home.) My BF also enjoyed it even though he does not eat fish or seafood of any kind, but he loves Japanese food otherwise. Some of the stuff here is more traditional and some is more fusion-y, but I really love that they have options! 10/10 would return again!",

While you have to climb two steep flights of stairs, you won't be disappointed with the food and experience that awaits you!  Umami's hours make it a great late night adventure with friends. During my last visit, a friend and I  were craving some good ramen, and decided to venture to Umami around 11pm. Upon arrival, we were seated by the grill, which is something a highly recommend to people! Watching the chefs cook the beautiful dishes in front of you definitely adds to your dining experience.  My friend I shared the ramen and takoyaki, and both were delicious!! The takoyaki was piping hot and it was fun to watch the bonito flakes \"dance\" from the heat. The ramen was clean and not too salty and a perfect size for sharing (if you're not too hungry). Sadly, we were quite hungry that day and I wasn't able to capture a picture of these dishes. However, I did take a picture of the dessert (fried ice cream with berries). Wow was this dessert both pretty and delicious!! It was the perfect ending to a great meal! The dish comes with nuts, but if you're allergic be sure to ask the waiter/waitress for it without nuts. I found them to be very accommodating to this request!!",

The door is around the corner from a large bar, with a sign that's more of a Japanese stamp than indicator of what's within.  You must be able to climb 2 flights of stairs (not ADA friendly at all), and as you go up the narrow stairs, you feel transported to a Shinjuku nightclub.   It's loud and the dj's at the end of the bar are skilled. So loud that I couldn't hear the hostess or my waitress, but they are willing to get up close and talk right in your ear. They only have high tops, which I always hate because the angle makes my feet dangle and my thighs fall asleep. But...  Their food is extraordinary. I over ordered because I couldn't decide. They had a thick okonomiyaki filled with big chunks of pork and broccoli- unusual filling for traditional okonomiyaki, but delicious. There were fat slices of grilled eggplant topped with ground chicken that were creamy and fresh in the best ways. Personally I thought the eggplant was a bit thick to deal with given that the chicken was juicy and the whole thing difficult to eat with chopsticks, but it was so good flavor and presentation wise. The outstanding winner for me was the delicate egg custard, savory and mushroom filled. It reminded me of a superb homemade silky tofu with lots of flavor in that creamy little pot.  Overall they have a great chef in the kitchen, and a warm, thumping vibe in front.",

The restaurant is kinda hidden (and exciting in this way). You have to keep an eye out for this gem. Once you find the door you have to go up a few stairs (which isn't so great if you're handicapped or older), and you'll be warmly welcomed by a host.  The atmosphere is amazing. I was so amazed at the beauty and sleek design of the interior. I felt fancy! I almost felt like I was in Japan.  My friends and I shared a lot of dishes family style. The most memorable food item I ate was the matcha sponge cake. Last time I checked, it was no longer available (so sad) but the other options are sure to impress you!  This is definitely a treat-yourself kind of place! And more so a place for those 21+! Will most certainly come again!",

Came back for happy hour on a Friday afternoon around 5pm and it was not as packed so there was plenty of seating. ordered a few appetizers to get a feel for different things. I ended up ordering the deviled eggs, Miso Soup and the smoked salmon sushi. ALL AMAZINGLY GOOD! next I ordered, broccoli and a raw salmon and raw scallop sushi (each came as one piece). Not normally my thing to eat scallop raw but it was good. drinks were excellent too. Asked the bartender to make me something that tasted like Asian pear, which normally isn't on the menu but he made something up. Great staff. All very nice.",

    "text": "Walking into (or up to) Umami set the tone for what was a completely non-traditional Pittsburgh late night experience.  We went to Umami hoping for sushi, but arrived too late, as they stop serving sushi before the rest of the kitchen closes.  Thankfully, there were so many other amazing small plate options we didn't miss the sushi at all!  The meat skewers were outrageously good...we tried the pork belly, and chicken thigh...and then 3 MORE pork belly skewers as they were on special for the late night happy hour.  Followed by the Takoyaki which was out of this world delicious.  We shared a Ramen bowl, and as recommended by our server ate that delightful 5-10 egg on it's own instead of mixing it in with the noodles.  I literally wanted to ask for a plate of those eggs all by themselves.  Sooo good.  The fried chicken with gravy dipping sauce was good, but at this point we realized our eyes were bigger than our stomachs...clearly a sign that we need to go back!  I loved the atmosphere at Umami for a late night snack.  Dim red lighting, a DJ spinning house music that created a relaxing atmosphere with a touch of \"I almost want to get out of this seat and dance.\"  Our server was wonderful and took time to help us navigate the very unique menu.  My only mark against the restaurant is that it requires patrons to climb two flights of stairs and did not appear to be wheelchair accessible, which means a very close friend will not be able to visit Umami. I hope I am incorrect and that perhaps there is another entrance? That is the only reason for 4 stars...otherwise...I don't have a bad thing to say!  It truly is an authentic experience and I cannot wait to go back!",

The service was prompt and attentive, and the interior was tastefully decorated with an modern feel. There was a sushi bar as well as individual small tables scattered around the periphery of the restaurant. The food was a hit-or-miss, hence the 3.5 overall rating. We ordered:  - Salmon Handroll: my favorite dish of the night. A single hand roll with a generous portion of salmon and salmon eggs. It came with a pipette of soy sauce. - Spicy Tuna Onigiri: my other favorite dish of the night. It was rather small, and also came with a pipette of soy sauce. - Karaage (fried chicken): I had high hopes but it didn't cut it. The texture of the fried chicken was good; however, the flavor was unidimensional and didn't have much flavor apart from being salty. It came with a tonkotsu gravy which was okay. - Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodles (to share): my least favorite dish of the night. The noodles were bland, and the broth lacked richness and dimensionality. - Panda Panda Panda drink: I liked the drink. It was very fruity, and came in a interesting fish-shaped vessel. Not too strong.  I'll probably come back to Umami and only stick to the sushi dishes the next time I'm there. It seems like a good late-night spot.",

It's up two flights of stairs and the vibe is super trendy. We were told there would be at least a 45 minute wait since we didn't have reservations but then got seated quite quickly at the \"kitchen bar.\" My one suggestion would be for the staff to ask guests if it's their first time so that they could explain the menu. We told them it was our first time and she said the style is order as you go and the food comes out very quickly. She also explained the menu to us. We started by ordering Waygu beef skewers and a sushi bowl. The skewer was delicious! I wasn't crazy about the sushi bowl but was happy to try something new, as it was straight raw fish rather than sushi rolls. We ended with the pork gyozo dumplings which were so tasty. I was so impressed. I would recommend trying this place for a new experience and next time will try one of the ramen bowls.",

    "text": "Yesterday, after a hard day of cleaning, Chris and I ventured out late at night (aka 9) to grab a bite. I have been wanting to go here since I saw reviews popping up for this place. It is close so we made a reservation with open table and got right in.  If you cannot climb steps due to joints/vertigo/anything this is not the place for you. The steps up to the restaurant are steep and you have to go two flights up. It is a warning for those who might not make it.   This place was thumping for a Tuesday night! I could not believe how packed it was. People were at tables, at the bar, and at the sushi bar!   The tables are all high tops (eh) with backed chairs (a plus). Our table slightly sloped so that when we moved our water to the right it slid off the table along with my glass. I do not know if the table was sloped, the floor was sloped, or if the table was so waxy that it just slid right off. After that we kept our food and drinks to the left.   So we started with the bites! These all were grilled on little wooden skewers. It was nice to be able to watch your food being cooked in the open kitchen.   ROBATAYAKI W/TARE & TOGARASHI:  Japanese eggplant -- Three medallions of eggplant. It was grilled perfectly and had a great taste to it. Chris and I both agreed for $1.5 we would get it again.  Beef tenderloin -- Again about 4 pieces of tenderloin on a skewer. These pieces were really good. The marinade plus the grilling flavor, yum. But the bites were smaller than a bite so while good, probably not again.   Then we moved to our \"main course\" which I say in quotes because Chris decided he was not going to get a real meal but just dumplings.  YATAI:  Pork Gyoza: pan fried pork & cabbage pot stickers, rayu shoyu. Ok, at first I argued with him about this. I was like, \"this is $8, I could buy a bag for cheaper than that....\" But I was glad that he talked me into it. These were not the usual frozen from a bag from the strip gyoza. These were handmade, delicious, and we ordered two of them. TWO! After Chris devoured one plate he said, \"can we get another?\" I was not about to tell him no. They were fried together into a circle and had thin cut hot peppers that were slightly fried. I only ate THREE dumplings out of the two orders we got. He really enjoyed them.   Tonkotsu Ramen: pork char siu, bamboo shoots, 5:10 egg, scallion, nori. I am a fan. This was a great dish. I will say that the waiter said it was totally split-able but in my opinion (so take that as you may) it really wasn't. There wasn't enough meat/broth/noodles to get a full split. I mean, I could have had more noodles and broth just for me.   I really liked it here. It was a little dark so I didn't take pictures, we were seated pretty close to another couple and I didn't want to ruin their night by flashing pictures! Can't wait to go back!",

They asked us to wait another twenty mins for the table, so we decided to sit at the bar. The food I've tried is delicious but nothing was the best I've ever had. The okonomiyaki and bacon quail egg were yummy, the matcha sponge cake dessert is also very good! Other things I've tried, takoyaki, miso Raman, Chicken skin and chicken thigh are just average.

    "text": "My husband and I love it here. We used to frequent Tamari and were sad when it closed, but it was great to find out Roger Li had opened this place and it was somehow even better. It has always been an amazing experience. Just walking up to the place on the third floor is an experience--paper lanterns, large art coating the walls, the din of people enjoying themselves before you get to the top. It's a great atmosphere that feels exclusive. Dim, trendy, intimate. The kitchen is wide open and you can watch it all unfold from almost any seat except the bar and private room.  The karaage is a necessity--Japanese fried chicken with an amazing rich gravy dipping sauce. It's generally on the happy hour menu as well. The handrolls are also very good and arrive with little pipettes of soy sauce. My favorite item from our last trip was the chirashi, a sashimi rice bowl. The robatayaki--a street food staple with skewered food grilled over hot coals--is also fantastic and something you won't see often anywhere else. Our favorites are the whole squid (grilled and cut into strips that end up being just like larger calamari rings, so don't be too scared to order it!), chicken skin, and the shishito peppers when they have them. Shishitos are generally not very spicy, but it's possible to get a really hot one every so often.  It's easy to find yourself spending more than you were expecting to here, as the menu generally encourages you to order the items a la carte and it can be a bit pricey if you start to get excited by all the options. There are some dishes that can be ordered as a solo meal, such as a couple larger ramen bowls, but mainly you're ordering things piecemeal here. It's a great place to go once in awhile for a trendier happy hour or a fun night on the town. They also have one private room with two larger tables, which can be reserved for parties and is a nice experience. Keep in mind you'll want to check for reservations in general on the weekends--it is often packed!",

We arrived right at our reservation time and were seated immediately. Since this was our first time at Umami, our excellent server, Elizabeth, explained the izakaya style in which the food is served. The food is prepared pretty quickly, so you place multiple orders rather than ordering everything at once. Elizabeth and others checked on us frequently to ask if we needed anything.  The menu obviously sets Umami apart as well. My table ordered skewers (chicken thigh, pork belly, chicken heart, and chicken skin), hand rolls (yellowtail and mackerel), ramen, and yatai (fried chicken, octopus balls, and eggplant with ground chicken). Everything was delicious except for the ramen, which we all agreed lacked flavor, even with the chili sauce. Next time I'll just stick with the yatai dishes, which were small plates of fried Japanese-style street food.  There's a lot of great options to try at Umami, so my advice would be to bypass the ramen and sushi, which you get elsewhere, and stick with the unique and memorable flavors of the fried street foods!",

    "text": "So I'm totally over this Pittsburgh trend of new restaurants that prioritize presentation over flavor.  My first experience with Umami left me underwhelmed.  Our party of 5 arrived on time for our 7:30 resy on a Friday night, and the restaurant was pretty packed.  In fact, we had to wait 15 minutes for our table, which ended up being in the \"traditional seating\" room.  The ambiance all around was pretty sick, from the sunken-in wood floor seating to the muraled windows and skylight.  Still some kinks to work out though--a large mounted fan provided ventilation for what would have otherwise been a super stuffy room, but also continuously blew around our napkins and the nori on our plates as we ate.  I guess they worked with what they have in this very limited space.  As for the service, we repeatedly worried that our server had forgotten about us, as we waited quite a while for our orders to be taken, and there were large gaps before we received our drinks and our meals--the food all came out at different times, and our meal ended with her intense struggle to split our check correctly.  Granted, it has to be super awkward to serve in that room--you kind of have to kneel down to be level with where we were sitting, but we were all left with the feeling that perhaps it was her first night on the job.  Our drinks did not disappoint.  The falling petal sake was beautifully floral without being overbearing, the black tea was served in a generous pot, and the beer was priced right.  Foodwise, my fiance and I ordered the SHIITAKE MUSHROOM and JAPANESE EGGPLANT ROBATAYAKI, the BRANZINO SASHIMI, and the TONKOTSU RAMEN.  I also tried to order the SHISHITO PEPPERS, but were told that they were out of season with no replacement.  Whomp, whomp.    The robatayaki were pretty disappointing, with very little char from the grill and little flavor besides the hint of seasoning from the brushed-on tare, which was all goop and no taste.  I was expecting mushroom caps for the shiitakes as previous Yelp photos showed, but received sad little vertical slices of mushrooms instead...is this a cost cutting measure?  It certainly did not enhance taste or portion size.    The ramen slightly redeemed the meal.  Admittedly, I'm very ramen-picky, but the broth has decent enough flavor but ironically was pretty one-noted...I believe I would diagnose that with a lack of umami. No complexity.  Still, it shouldn't be hard to make a great bowl of soup with the crap-ton of pork fat that is tonkotsu ramen is based on, so they met expectations in that respect.  My far less picky fiance was very pleased.  The big letdown, however, was the branzino.  I ordered it to satiate my curiosity, as I've never before had raw branzino.  And I know it's a mild fish, but this sashimi had zero. flavor.  I mean, there was a tiny kick from the same weak tare brushed on top, but the fish itself had not even a hint of taste, fishy or otherwise.  Also, it was chewy.  High quality sushi (unless it's something like squid or octopus or clam, obvi) should melt in your mouth.  This did not pass the test.  In awe of its absolute tastelessness, we passed this around the table to check if maybe my taste buds were out of order.  They weren't.  Sad--for the $8, we could have almost gotten another ramen bowl instead.  If I had to guess, perhaps they're still figuring out how to cure their sushi (yes, real, fresh sushi has to be cured before it's served--otherwise, it's tasteless).  The only feature of our food that was spot-on with what we experienced in Japan was the presentation.  Everything was artfully and tastefully plated, without being overdone.  And at the very least, unlike other \"trendy\" restaurants that have opened lately, Umami is not overpriced.  However, much like the restaurant space itself, it was a visually beautiful meal from start to finish but functionally, fell woefully short.",

I immediately noticed the smell of sushi, not fishy, but fresh and lemony. You climb 2 flights of stairs and enter a really chill atmosphere. We sat at a table, but the best part was the bar area where you could watch the kitchen. Well sit there next time. We got drinks, very reasonably priced for Happy Hour. Some food items we got, the mushroom custard: this was my favorite thing! The flavor and texture was AMAZING! Get it! Also, the Scottish Salmon skewer: delicious and tender, the Wagyu tenderloin skewer: my boyfriend says this was his favorite taste. He got the sushi bowl, which was well worth the $18, boasting a wonderful assortment of fish, rice, sauces, and ginger. I got the pancake, which was super flavorful and huge. We can't wait to go back! Definitely would recommend trying some of the more unique items on the menu, the skewers, and that custard. I've never had anything like it.",

I have never eaten in the sunken booth dining room, only the high-top table and bar side and it is lots of fun! Usually, in the evening there is a DJ and fun drinks abound. Make sure to make a reservation!  There is a sushi chef but you should not think of sushi as the main event. The fish seems very fresh here, so don't play it safe! Get things like the whole grilled fish or octopus balls. I imagine you only order food you are familiar with and you might be \"underwhelmed\" as some of the other reviewers mentioned. Don't fall into that trap! There is much to be enjoyed here! Great addition to the neighborhood and Pittsburgh's growing food scene.",

    "text": "After following Umami through its many pop-up events, I am very excited that it is finally open!  Even more delightful is its wonderful, very authentic atmosphere. Upon entering, I immediately felt transported to a True Izakaya experience. Pittsburgh needs more authentic ethnic places like this!  We had not made reservations, but we came at 9:40ish on a weeknight and were able to get seats at the kitchen-facing counter bar. The hostess was gracious, and we received impeccable service all night from our server Sheryl.  It was super fun to watch the chefs working. As someone who is obsessed with food and cooking in all forms and watches lots of shows/documentaries involving professional chefs, I was pleasantly surprised.  These chefs really know what they are doing.  The hot towel they give you in the beginning is a really nice touch, and we enjoyed some cold sake with our meal. My partner got the tuna sashimi and the Nasu Shigiyaki and thought both were delicious. Apparently the Nasu Shigiyaki, which is half of a japanese eggplant pan-fried and topped with ground chicken and an incredibly delicious sauce, is a staff favorite.  Well, let me tell you, the staff have good taste. It is a dish that you might overlook on the menu, but it is awesome!  I was impressed.  I got the ramen, and while it's one of the better bowls of ramen you can get in Pittsburgh, it was a bit on the salty side, the char siu was excessively fatty, and the bamboo shoots were uninspiring.  The egg was done perfectly, though.  Overall, I enjoyed the ramen at the Umami ramen pop-up a lot more, so this was the only (very slight) disappointment of the meal.  We will definitely be returning to try some of the other food here!",

When we arrived without a reservation she put us on the waiting list and also told us the bar was first come, first serve. She walked by the bar to check out the anticipated wait and noticed if I couple moved down one seat we would be able to be seated right away. She kindly asked them and they obliged - so we got a spot at the bar within minutes of arriving! Great customer service!",

Umami is a bit tucked away as the entrance is to the left of Round Corner Cantina and you have to walk up two flights of stairs. I do recommend getting a reservation beforehand since the restaurant isn't huge. It was really neat seeing the open kitchen and how they prepare the food.   My friend and I each ordered the pork belly robatayaki skewer. The chunks of pork were large, tender, slightly charred, but lacking some flavor.   Next we shared the takoyaki. There were six takoyaki balls with shaved katsuobushi on top. The takoyaki had good flavor but lacked an outer crispy skin. The kewpie sauce was generously available on the plate so you could dip as much sauce as you wanted.   I ordered the zaru soba. It comes with a skewer of grilled salmon, which was excellently made as the salmon meat was exceptionally tender and fell off the skewer as I tried to eat it. The soba noodle sauce is more tart than traditionally sauces I've had since it's made with ponzu sauce. I found the tartness equally, if not more, delicious. My friend ordered the tonkotsu ramen. I only tried a bite, but the broth seemed very rich and authentic.   Service overall was excellent.",

    "text": "Around the side of Round Corner Cantina you will find a wooden door, go through, head up the stairs, and you will find yourself in Umamai, a bustling lounge-like Izakaya. You can sit at the bar, the sushi bar, or at a high top where you order drinks and small Japanese plates to enjoy while a DJ spins. It's quite dark in here but not too loud and we enjoyed a leisurely meal here a lot.  We started with a selection of grilled skewers which were very good and then moved onto some expertly fried Shrimp Tempura (plump juicy shrimp, lightly battered, not at all greasy). Next we shared a large sashimi plate which was very generous for the price, the fish and Octopus, were good quality and weren't served too chilled (over cold sushi is one of my pet hates!), we finished our meal with a couple of Yellowtail Hand Rolls which were excellent - well sized, containing a generous portion of large chunks of Yellowtail. There's a good variety of things to choose from on the menu, there's also a section featuring Udon and Ramen, and the food and drinks are all reasonably priced. It's a good spot for a romantic dinner for two but it is equally great for a bigger group as there should be something for everyone's taste on the menu, whether they are a seasoned sushi eater or a newcomer to Japanese cuisine. Service was pretty good and you can make reservations which may be a good idea at the weekends or for larger groups.  All in all, if you want a fun night out with delicious food that won't cost you the earth I'd say Umami is well worth investigating.",

    "text": "This was everyone in our party's first visit to Umami. (There were 8 of us.) It's a very cool spot above Round Corner Cantina in Lawrenceville. (It could use better signage though.)  Pros: The waitresses are very friendly, accommodating and attentive. We never had empty drinks and the food came out quickly despite our larger party on a Friday nite. The food...delicious!! We had starters which were various proteins on skewers with a tasty sauce. Pork belly, quail eggs wrapped in bacon, Waygu Beef and shrimp (pictured) as well as a large mushroom and shrimp tempura (not pictured). The sashimi plate was as delicious as it was a gorgeous presentation. You could tell they use high quality fish. The cocktails were very good, strong and it was nice that you could pick from gin or vodka as your cocktail base. (Tokyo Rain Drop was my favorite.)  The DJ or music they had playing was just loud enough, enjoyable and upbeat. The ambience is eclectic, colorful and changes as you ascend to the 3rd floor. Bravo Umami for superb decor!  Cons: The seating if you have a party over 6 people. They only have one room to accommodate 12 people max. The room itself is a nice size with a gorgeous ceiling mural, but the tables are in a \"pit,\" so you have a significant step down into the pit to sit at your table. At first we thought we were sitting on the floor on pads, but that was not the case. No one in our party minded since we are all in fairly decent shape with no major issues, but anyone with knee, leg or other issues, this would be a deterrent. Also the restaurant and bar are on the 3rd floor with the bathrooms on the 2nd floor and they're a bit hidden. Just a heads up for anyone with issues climbing 3 flights of stairs and so on.  Parking can be tough anywhere in Lawrenceville so I always suggest leaving a bit earlier or take a Lyft or Uber.",

Yakitori, karaege and Tonkotsu ramen were not we expected. There were only three choices of yakitori when we went there. Others from \"robatayaki\" were vegetable and pork belly. Karaage was not Japanese karaage, more like popcorn chicken. Tonkotsu ramen was not an authentic tonkotsu ramen, more like a Chinese noodle. However, I gave Umami 4 stars because their grilled fish and sushi are the best among I ate in Pittsburgh. I will return to the restaurant for their fishes. And we are looking for their new sushi bar on the second floor, which will be opened around May.",

Coming from a place of prime beef I found the waygu appetizer to be supremely underwhelming and lacking in flavor. The fish, although fresh just felt off and it felt as though the price of the fish indicated they were selling ambiance instead of a tasting experience. There are much higher quality sushi spots in Pittsburgh for a lower price. It's a nice place to go for a couple drinks and a small plate, but True sushi lovers may want to look elsewhere. I had the tako (octopus) sashimi and a rainbow roll, as well as several other sashimi pieces I can't recall.",

Although I would love to go back and sit at one of the tables tucked down into the floors, I very much enjoyed the show of cooking that came with our seats. You surely don't feel like you're in Pittsburgh anymore once you climb the flights of stairs to get to this uniquely decorated restaurant.   From our cocktails, to our appetizer skewers, to our entrees.. everything was delicious. But by far my favorite thing is the savory pancake on the appetizer menu. I don't know the legitimate name for it but it says \"savory pancake\" underneath of it's actual name and that's all I needed to see to order it. The pancake ingredients changed from one visit to the next, but I can't tell you which was better because they were both so. good. I can't wait to go back to consume another one. Our second favorite thing were the bacon wrapped quail egg skewers. Another thing not to miss! Everything we ate had such great flavor combinations, and the staff was so helpful and pleasant on top of it.",

The server said her favorite was the corn which I'll have to try next. The menu has nice variety and you can have a light, medium, or heavy meal. The chirashi and ramen are my favorite for full meals. Service is consistently good and the atmosphere is very cool.  Note- it is a small restaurant and gets loud, so if you have trouble hearing in loud places or trouble projecting, that might be tough. The seats near the windows definitely get cold. Also, it's not ADA accessible- there are 2 flights of steep stairs.",

We also had the takoyaki, which are fried balls with octopus in the center. Those were fantastic! I would definitely recommend trying those. Finally, for my meal, I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen.

We recently visited with some friends who had never been there before. We were excited to have them try everything! We made a late reservation at 9:30, but got there early to have some drinks. They had a drink special going: a light beer and sake shot for $5. Without a table or a seat at the bar, our group was definitely in the way and had to constantly move so people could get by. There isn't room for standing at all.   Once at our table, we ordered a the sashimi rice bowl to share. It offered once of the best tasting pieces of salmon I've ever had! We also ordered the edamame - It was pretty standard. For our meals we ordered the ramen and the udon noodles. Both were amazing!!   Our waitress was super helpful and friendly. Only negative is that it is located on the third? floor, and you have to walk up many stairs. This would be a huge problem for anyone who has difficulty with stairs or needs an accessible entrance.",

Umami makes Japanese food right-- they have an amazing variety of food, each spiced with a careful hand and presented beautifully. This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh, and my go-to when I'm craving Japanese food.   I've tried most of their menu-- nigiri is well formed and garnished neatly; sashimi expertly sliced and tender; karaage perfectly spiced; okonomiyaki tasty but not excessively heavy; fried ice cream warm and well balanced. I've never had a dish I didn't like, and each dish has its own flavor profile, carefully perfected.   While a little bit on the pricier side, the quality of the food here is absolutely worth it. You can make reservations online (and should if you have a party larger than 2 or want a table), but seating is first come first serve. The bar seating is full service, and the staff is all amazingly attentive and friendly.",

    "text": "Once you reach the building that Umami resides in, going up the stairs to the top floor is like an experience. With each flight of stairs that you climb, the wallpaper pattern changes and each design is beautiful. The staircase is a bit narrow and the steps are rather steep but it takes less than 5 minutes to reach the 3 flights of stairs. Once you emerge, the set up is small and cozy with a bar on your left and the kitchen along the length of the restaurant. I really liked the aesthetics of the restaurant and it even translates to the presentation of the food.   Food and Drink Ordered: * worth trying  - [Suppai Shoga] : Beautifully presented. Tasted very refreshing and has a strong ginger taste which could be a hit or miss for some people. The foam on top had a lemony taste but I missed some of the other flavors in the drink.   - [Karaage] : Tastes like the description: fried chicken. The meat was not dry, which was a plus but I've definitely had better. I actually preferred dipping it in the takoyaki sauce rather than the sauce that it was provided with.   - [Takoyaki*] : Tasted like good classic takoyaki.  - [Robatayaki] : Because we couldn't decide on which robatayaki to order, my friends and I ordered one skewer of the bacon quail egg, chicken heart, and Wagyu beef tenderloin. This appetizer was a bit disappointing because there wasn't any flavor for the chicken heart and Wagyu beef tenderloin. The Wagyu beef was also a bit tough. The bacon quail egg was delicious but it's usually pretty difficult to have a flavorless bacon quail egg.   - [Chirashi bowl*] : Overall, the taste was good. My friend said that this chirashi bowl was better than the one at Chaya Japanese Cuisine. Some of the fish tasted very fresh but others did not. Not to say that the fish tasted bad but it wasn't phenomenal. I did like the addition of the pipette; it controlled the amount of soy sauce necessary for the fish so that the flavors of the fish weren't smothered.   - [Tonkotsu Ramen*] : The ramen was very delicious, especially the broth which had a very strong sesame taste if you're into that. The only downside is that the pork ribs were a bit dry.  Would I go back? : Of course! I believe that food should look as good as it tastes and for the most part, Umami hits that mark. I like all the options that Umami provides. Even after ordering five items, excluding the drink, there are so many other items that I wanted to try. This place is really nice to good with friends so that you can try a little bit of everything for a reasonable cost. The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating was because not everything that I ate hit the mark but if I could on Yelp, I would give Umami a 4.5 rating because it was pretty darn good.",

The wagyu was cooked perfectly and I probably could've eaten the whole cow if prepared that way.  That would be a pretty long skewer! Long enough to poke an ugly naked guy across the street (sorry had to make the Friends reference) Temaki was beautifully presented and one of the best rolls I've had in Pittsburgh.   Overall? Great atmosphere, phenomenal food, and can't beat the price. I'll be back many more times.",

The staff was very gracious, providing us with champagne while we waited for a table.  Once seated we enjoyed amazing service as well as amazing food. Kristen was our server.  You gotta love a server who is knowledgeable and helpful with the menu but also knows how to have fun with her guests. #teamkristen. Chef Roger even accommodated my husband with a custom gluten free entree, also amazing.  The menu here is original, funky and delicious. The staff is kind and well trained.

We also ordered a special sushi of the day which was good. For drinks I had Japanese beer which I liked.

One complaint on the layout is that you will most likely be seated DIRECTLY NEXT TO another table. Like inches away. It's a little awkward. There is another room in the back with more traditional (floor) seating that I'd like to try.   Our server was very friendly and had lots of recommendations (and patience) since it was our first time there. My date ordered the ginger ginger cocktail and I ordered the \"pure dawn\" sake. Both were good but the cocktail was pretty bitter - a good palate cleanser but definitely a sipping drink.  For an appetizer we ordered the grilled octopus balls based on recommendations from our server and other Yelp-ers. There were OK. I think it was mostly bread and they were very filling. If there was octopus in there I couldn't tell you.   For the second course we shared the chirashi (a mix of sashimi with a quail egg and salmon roe). The fish was very fresh and it was enough to share.   For the main course my date ordered the miso ramen and I got ramen with pork (can't find the name of this right now). Both were good; I think the miso ramen had a better broth. Also both were very filling! If you plan to order these as a main course I'd dial it back on the appetizers.  All in all it was a fun and relaxing experience. Plan on taking your time to try new things and eat slowly.",

It's a brand new place and it is a bit chaotic, but the food, presentation, service and attitude is all in the right place. The idea is to drink have fun and keep ordering small plates without having to worry too much about the bill, at least that was my idea, and everyone at my table had a memorable evening. The food was absolutely imaginative, well prepared  and exquisitely presented. The drinks where also imaginative and well though out. When the bill arrived we sent it back because it seamed to be  too low, but it came back the same. (about $30 ahead with plenty of drinks) I'll find some excuse to be back. Great job Umami!",

My first experience was super wonderful; my partner and I sat at the bar, enjoyed the pork ramen, the hot sake, the music, the interior, everything! On top of that, we received excellent service from our bartender. I dine out in Pittsburgh quite often but, unfortunately, my second experience with Umami was terrible and is the catalyst for this review. I wish I was joking when I say this because it sounds comical, but I can't guarantee that you'll be waited on at Umami if you happen to share a mutual acquaintance with their front of house staff.  I loved Umami so much the first time that I went back one early evening a few weeks ago, only a couple of days after my first visit. We again sat at the bar. It was empty, save for one other patron a few seats down. We were happy to be greeted by the same bartender who took care of us on our previous trip. She took our orders, we enjoyed our meal without incident, and were ready to pay and leave. We noticed then that we hadn't seen our bartender in a bit, possibly because her shift ended or she was on a break - whatever the reason. This would have been a minor inconvenience if there hadn't been another bartender working alongside ours for the entirety of our meal, so we anticipated simply cashing out with her.  We had been finished with our meals for about 10 minutes now. During this time, this second bartender made drinks for the floor when she had to but otherwise walked back and forth in front of us, busying herself with random tasks while we sat there, watched her, and waited. She never makes eye contact, never stops to check on us to see if we need anything, no interaction whatsoever. The bar remains empty with still just one other patron, with whom she IS interacting. We eventually place our cards on the bar in an attempt to somehow get her attention. I said \"excuse me\" once as she shuffled by, but was passed over.  At this point I recognize this bartender, L*nzee, as a friend of one of my ex-partners from several years ago. Admittedly my first instinct, I concluded that it was silly to presume we were not being waited on for that reason.   Several more minutes go by with absolutely no consideration from her whatsoever. We now suspect she is actively disregarding us. This realization is confirmed when we watch her leave the bar and pull a server from the floor (which from what I could see was busy - almost all of the tables were full). She tells the server to go find our check on the bar's POS system, ring us up, and cash us out. We see and hear all of this happen because we are sitting adjacent to the entire interaction. The server confusingly leaves her section of tables to go behind the bar. She has trouble locating our tab and the bartender has to walk back in front of us to assist the server with finding our check. So now, she is literally at her own POS station directly across from us with the ability to turn around and deliver our tab. Instead, she continues to willfully evade us while remaining behind the bar and keeps this server away from her own tables in order to run our cards. It's totally uncomfortable watching all of this unfold. Thankfully, this server was super friendly. We felt badly for unnecessarily taking up her time to do someone else's job; however, we were more than ready to leave at this point. We paid, tipped 20%, and tried to forget about it.  The most pathetic part of the whole experience is that this bartender later bragged to our server that she did intentionally ignore us to spite me because she is friends with my ex. This admission eventually got back to my dining partner (who also works in the service industry) via the server herself, and eventually to me this afternoon. Are you kidding??! This is absolutely ridiculous, immature, and completely unprofessional. I would never anticipate this kind of behavior from a long-time bartender at a brand new restaurant, barely open a few months, for such petty, unrelated, and ignorant reasons. Pittsburgh is way too small for this kind of senseless dining experience. It goes without saying that this is a business, not middle school. The whole thing soured my initially positive impression of Umami, is flat out embarrassing for the bartender in particular (I can't believe that as an adult she would be proud of herself for this), and most regrettably reflects poorly on Umami's staff as a whole.",

    "text": "I try to use Yelp only as a tool to find restaurants near me, because I think it's generally unfair to the establishment and staff (most patrons have no idea how a restaurant actually works, so unless a server is actually blowing a snot rocket into somebody's food, it's really just some kind of an imagined slight on the part of the customer). THAT BEING SAID: CHECK IT OUT!! We loved Umami, and would most definitely plan on coming back. The food was delicious, the staff was fantastic, and I thought it was reasonably priced.  From the moment you walk in, it has a cool vibe. There are stairs, but it's not a big deal. I totally dig the red neon lights, the wall art (sumo wrestlers!) and the bar was spacious (definitely did not expect that considering the space from outside, so a nice surprise!) our group ordered 3 of the signature cocktails, and they were great. I personally would recommend #GodzillaTears. My friends got Ginger Ginger, and a cute cocktail with an ice ball in it, and they thoroughly enjoyed them.   The quail egg skewer wrapped in bacon was the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. My friend ordered chicken hearts on a skewer, and she loved it. The sushi and the ramen bowls were excellent as well.   Give it a try! I loved this place and we will definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "We'll go good to bad here:  Price - Grade: A. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised with how reasonably priced everything on the menu was.  Food - Grade: B. The Bacon Quail Egg and Pork & Shrimp Shumai were bomb. The Chicken Heart, Salmon sashimi, and Tonkotsu Ramen were all good, but nothing to write home about. The Spicy Tuna Riceball and Tableside Tofu definitely missed their marks. The Riceball was just that - a ball of rice. The amount of tuna was very disappointing; and there was slightly steamed seaweed on the outside making for a very chewy experience. The Tableside Tofu was not good - it was like a flavorless pudding. There were sauces provided, but the method to eat it was frustratingly difficult. We were given one small bowl with one spoon for two people. So we opted to both eat out of the serving bowl; I gave my wife the one spoon and I used a ladle. Why didn't we just ask for another utensil? I'll get to that...  Service - Grade: D. Comically bad actually. The fact that we just kept laughing about how bad it was ended up making for a pretty enjoyable experience for us and bumped the Grade up from an F.  The dining experience starts off with a guy asking if we'd gotten a hot towel yet. Seems like an easy thing to keep track of, but we reply no. He leaves and returns a few minutes later with below room temperature towels. My wife and I just look at each other and laugh.  The waiter then shows up and describes how the Umami menu works. 'We do things a bit differently here and don't do traditional courses. Rather than ordering appetizers, then entrees, then dessert, you order as you go. You're in the driver's seat. On the left side of the menu, you see our smaller plates. I recommend starting with those. In the middle and right side of the menu, you see our larger plates. And at the bottom right, you can find some great plates to finish your meal with.' So..you just described every other f***ing restaurant in the world. Despite claiming to be really changing things up.  Against his recommendation of ordering food as we finished them, we ordered our first 3 plates at once. And we were glad we did. After the first one showed up and we finished, the waiter was MIA for at least 20 minutes. I'm 90% sure he went to the back to do some blow because he came back all sorts of on edge.  The Towel Guy then returns to ask us if we had received a hot towel yet. No joke.  The missteps and fumbling continued throughout our meal. Like I said, we found it quite funny how bad it was, but I'm sure not everyone would.  Overall, it feels like they're trying so hard to be taken seriously, and just fell short. I would not go back to Umami.  Also, not sure how they sidestepped ADA requirements, but there are 2 flights of narrow stairs with disorienting wallpaper to enter the restaurant.",

I wish the pieces of octopus were a bit bigger but hey, I am nitpicking. These were our favorite.  2) Pork Belly: three bites on a skewer for $3 ain't bad. Love me some pork belly.  3) Japanese Eggplant: hard to get eggplant wrong but these bites were tasty as well.  4) Bacon Quail Eggs: $4 for three mini eggs wrapped w/ bacon on a skewer... these guys were delightful. Bacon is good.  5) Nasu Shigiyaki: for $9, I thought this guy would be more filling. Probably four to five bites from start to finish but had good flavor.  Drinks:  1) Gekkeikan Traditional - warm Sake in a small carafe... probably 4 servings. Enjoyable.  2) Falling Petal - cold draft Sake shot served with a dropper filled with Hibiscus. These were fun.  -Service was good. The server was friendly/patient and the restaurant encourages patrons to order in waves.  -All in all, we will be back. Small portions... order accordingly. Love that one can try a bit of everything on the menu for a few bucks. We spent under $45 for the above. I will be getting the whole fish next time and a few of the rolls.",

It would roam across the plains of over-sized portions and fried food of Pittsburgh, being itself and being the best at it while we all quietly watched.  This is the best restaurant not named after a starch and a protein in the city. If you don't feel like loading into a mega bus or shelling out the hundred bucks to JFK, Umami is the closest place to NYC in the burgh. I've been three or four times since it has opened, and I have nothing but good things to say. Literally, everything I've had from the chirashi to the robatayaki to the gyoza is unbeatable.  Not to brag, but I was also told by a server that my wife and I were the first to finish a bucket of sake and still order more. That's Umami, though. They'd be the best, they'd go for better, and they'd never settle. Umami would be the fastest, most graceful, beautiful gazelle.",

It's fun how the location is tucked around the corner from Butler on 38th and having to navigate the unassuming doors and hallways that go up into the restaurant. I'm confirming that the stairs can be a bit much such as if you have knee problems and if there are other people going in the opposite direction as they are narrow but I did ok. Because Umami is an izakaya the space is small.   I went with 2 other people and interestingly we were seated at a counter versus a table. Another odd thing that other reviewers have mentioned is that our waitress said everything on the menu is for sharing, including the ramen. I'll be ordering my own next time! In any case we ordered the following to share: the special fish robatayaki, bacon quail egg robatayaki, pork belly robatayaki, salmon temaki, tuna temaki, mackerel temaki, okonomiyaki and karaage. I would order everything again except for the special fish robatayaki as it was bland but everything else was delicious. One thing that was new to me were the plastic pippetts with soy sauce that came with the handrolls/temakis - I like how it controlled how much and when as I ate it!",

    "text": "I've been creeping on umamis yelp page since it opened and couldn't wait to go. To get there find the big glossy black door on the side of round corner cantina, climb the two flights of stairs, and you're there! I absolutely love the vibe of this restaurant. The kitchen is open so you get to see all of the different dishes come out which is awesome if you are unfamiliar with the menu.  When you sit down you get a hot towel to wash your hands. At first I thought this was unnecessary but after I actually used it I was really happy to have it and thought it was a nice touch. Next you are offered sparkling water or tap and can order a drink. We both got the lone wolf and cub combo of a Kirin Ichiban draft beer and a falling petal shot ( cold surprisingly smooth sake with a dropper of hibiscus to drop in) this was 5 bucks which I think is a pretty good deal! The waitress showed us the highlights of the menu and we decided to get some things to share. We got the takoyaki which are delicious deep fried balls of octopus and I'm not sure what else but definitely get them.  We each got a spicy tuna onigiri, both came with a dropper of soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi. I was really suprised to find that the wasabi was actually real wasabi. If you aren't normally a fan do yourself a favor and try it because it's completely different than the fake garbage most places serve...same with the ginger. We got an order of the pork gyoza, they were so good and came with a really good dipping sauce. The okonomiyaki which is the savory bacon and cabbage pancake, also amazing. And a couple skewers, the shrimp, eggplant, and bacon wrapped quail eggs. Those were awesome too. We loved everything we ordered.  As we were leaving we saw the whole fish (red snapper) cooking on the grill. Definitely think we'll try that next time. This place is definitely worth a special trip and would be a great place for a date. I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "TLDR; Don't buy the hype, this place is pretty mediocre. It might be 4-stars by Pittsburgh standards but it would probably be 3 or 3.5 max in a bigger city with more competition for Asian food.  My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken heart, chicken thigh + green onion, bacon + quail egg, and whole squid robatayaki. We also got the takoyaki, nasu shigiyaki (Japanese eggplant with ground chicken and miso), Hokkaido scallop special, and the sponge cake dessert. I'll go through each of these one by one:  The chicken heart was mostly OK. The texture could have been better, but mainly it was just slathered with too much sauce, which is a criticism that applies to many of these dishes.  The chicken thigh and green onion skewer was just sad. The chicken wasn't as juicy as at other places where I've had this dish, but the worst part was the green onion. It was so sad, thin, dry, and tasteless! It's supposed to come from the lower, round parts of the onion so that it's more substantial and flavorful, but all the pieces of green onion were from the flat, flimsy part at the top. This one was also slathered with too much sauce to let the natural flavors shine through. I want to *taste* the green onion, but instead it was reduced to a paper-thin vessel for sauce.  The bacon and quail egg skewer was acceptable.  The squid was okay, but it was served to us at room temperature, which made it a lot less appealing.  The takoyaki was again just okay. It didn't have the same kind of contrast between a slightly crispy exterior and soft, moist interior that I've come to expect from good takoyaki (though I'm spoiled since I recently came back from a trip to Osaka). I will call it a fine introduction if you've never had takoyaki before.  The eggplant was definitely the highlight of the meal. The eggplant had a nice texture and the chicken was tasty, though the flavors were too strong and salty, which pushed it towards feeling more like Asian fusion than authentic food.  The Hokkaido scallop dish was nice too. It was just raw scallop presented with some garnish.  The sponge cake dessert was awful. The so-called \"sponge cake\" was dense and hard as a rock. I suspect they just bought frozen sponge cake and dumped it on a plate. But even beyond that, the flavors of this dish were incredibly incohesive. It's as if they just tossed as many vaguely Asian dessert-y elements together on a plate as they could without thinking about how to make them talk to each other.  I will say that the presentation of the dishes was quite pretty and that the restaurant has a pretty cool ambiance. Still, in the end you have to look past appearances and judge the taste of its food. It just isn't good enough. Don't buy the hype.",

    "text": "I was thrilled to finally have an izakaya in Pittsburgh. Overall, Umami did not disappoint. Not the most traditional, but definitely fresh and tasty.  The good: RAZOR CLAMS (special) - Perfectly cooked clams in a savory sauce with garlic, pepper and chinese fermented black beans. Loved it except for the occasional sand in the clams.  SCALLOP (special) - Jumbo scallop served 2 ways, grilled and sashimi. The grilled one had the perfect amount of smokiness that went so well with the ponzu sauce. The thinly sliced sashimi had a slightly softer texture than expected, but tasted fresh and went very well with the dallop of serrano pepper sauce (caution, very hot!) and the seaweed and shaved beets accompaniments. PORK BELLY, BACON QUAIL EGG, SHIITAKE MUSHROOM - Pretty tasty, no complains (maybe except for the price). SALMON AND IKURA HANDROLL, HIRAME NIGIRI - Fish was fresh and sushi rice was well done. There was some crunchy rice seasoning at the bottom of the handroll which I was not a fan of. In retrospect, for the price of one handroll and one nigiri, I should probably go for the chirashi instead.  PORK & SHRIMP SHUMAI - Not sure that I could taste the shrimp, but it was porky and moist.  Not so good:  SHRIMP - Did not want to order this but the bf insisted. Shrimp tends to be a disappointment unless it is a live spot prawn. As expect, this was meh.   TONKOTSU RAMEN - This was the biggest disappointment of the night. Instead of the rich, milky and meaty broth that we love about tonkotsu ramen, we received a sweet, shoyu-type broth instead. The noodles and char siu were nothing to write home about either. Would not order again.  Overall, we had a very enjoyable meal, with delicious food, attentive service and decent drinks. Pricey, yes, but that seems to be a common problem with the exploding food scene in Pittsburgh. Will definitely return!",

    "text": "Probably the best ramen I've had in Pittsburgh. In general, though the city's been lacking in good ramen options over the past couple years, I'm finally glad to say that there is a place (this joint) in Pittsburgh that does serve acceptable ramen for the masses. The tonkotsu broth is not bad, definitely more flavorful and not as watered down as say, the broth that you get in ramen bowls at Ramen Bar, but it's definitely also not as flavorful as it could be. Noodles are pretty consistent and not too runny so I can definitely appreciate that (they have a bit of chew in them). Definitely eyed some of the other dishes when perusing the menu but I didn't have the stomach to eat everything I wanted. Will be back to try some of the other items & update review as appropriate. In general, great food & good service. Make sure to put down a reservation if you're coming on Friday nights or weekends as this place can get quite packed (it's really not that big, unfortunately)",

    "text": "I will start out this review like many others, walking up to the restaurant is a bit confusing to new comers. Follow the yellow brick road (the narrow black steps) all the way to the tippy top and you enter a small but unique restaurant. We went on a Thursday evening and were pleasantly surprised they had a DJ playing music but man the place was packed for a Thursday! We had reservations and still waited about 10 minutes for our table to get cleared up. The crowd didn't disperse either throughout our dinner.   Our waitress was very nice and went over the menu for us, very helpful!  They had everything from chicken heart skewers to bowls of ramen and maki.  I like that the menu says, \"order as you go.\" The plates are smaller and if you are looking to get filled up, you need to order more than one plate.  We started with the beef tenderloin and chicken heart skewers to share. The waitress was right, you definitely need to order more than one! Each skewer has 3 small pieces on it but they are also prices from $2-$4 so can't expect too much. Second, we had the pork and shrimp shumai..OH MY.. delicious. The plate came with six pieces, again, maybe good for one person but for two- order more:-)  Lastly, we both had ramen bowls. I got the miso ramen and if you like miso soup then you must try this! It's literally miso soup with a bit more spice and noodles so the goodness never ends!  I would definitely recommend checking this place out the vibe and decor is worth seeing , not to mention the food!",

    "text": "Umami just opened in Pittsburgh four days ago! I was so excited to finally get a reservation and try their offerings. I would definitely ensure that you book a res for this restaurant. You have to walk up two flights of stairs and on your way up, you will see beautiful lanterns and wallpaper with red lighting. The bar are is small as is the restaurant itself. Once you reach the top of the stairs, to the left is traditional floor seating and to the right is the bar and seating at tables. All tables are very close together so be prepared to stare at your neighbors or have them stare at you. The table seating really should be in a better layout as the servers have to navigate in very tight quarters between bar seating and table seating and among guests just standing around. I felt bad for the staff as I'm sure this is frustrating. The sake selection varies and we ended up getting a 300 ml bottle for $30. It was alright, nothing to write home about. My boyfriend ordered the Lion Wolf and Cub. Wow, this was delicious! It's a kirin draft and a falling petal shot which is draft sake shot infused with hibiscus! I could have drank these all night. Now onto the food. The pork and shrimp shumai had a great flavor and I love the added edamame on top. The takoyaki was hands down the best dish we had! I could have just ordered those for the rest of the night and been happy! Knowing that they just opened, I'll come back but will have to give it some time to allow them to work on a few things. Overall, another nice hip place to go to when you find yourself in Lawrenceville.",

We got sat down at the bar to eat and it was nice because I enjoyed watching the chefs make the food. We ordered a bunch of different dishes to share, which I recommend doing because there were so many options. My favorite thing was the pork skewers and the pork gyoza. The Gyoza was presently different than what I'm use to seeing, which was cool. My friend had recommended the Yaki Udon (pictures) because I've never tried any before and had amazing flavors. There was a DJ in the corner playing songs and the Japanese atmosphere was so chill. The white peach cider was a little too sweet but a good choice if you don't like beer.",

    "text": "Umami, meaning savory, is one of the 5 basic tastes (other ones are sweet, sour, bitter, and salty).  It also translates to deliciousness, which is exactly what this restaurant is, lots of yumminess. Umami Pittsburgh is set up as an izakaya, which are usually casual pubs Japanese businessmen tend to hang out in after work.  This one is a bit fancier and more Americanized.  The decor, including the narrow sets of stairs you have to walk up, tries to mimic that pub environment, making it a fun yet classy place.  My partner and I came in early, about an hour before our group's reservation. We came in around 6:15pm on a Friday afternoon and just made the Happy Hour (which ends at 6:30pm). The place wasn't too busy yet so we sat ourselves at the bar without a wait. I ordered the Violet Snow because of  the lychee calpico ofc, and he got the House sake.  Mang, my drink was dangerous, I could not taste an ounce of the rum, just the sweet lychee flavor.  Umami has a small separate area to accommodate larger parties. At first, it looked like we had to sit Japanese style, but there is sort of a sub level area for your legs! It was really cool and creative.  I'd highly recommend trying to get that area if possible. But it'd be hard to fit anything more than 8 people, which we had.  It got cozy.  My favorite foods of the night were (1) Takoyaki (octopus balls), it came piping hot and full of flavor. It comes 6 per order, we got two plates. (2) Whole squid robatayaki, which is essentially sliced grilled squid, the smokey flavor was on point. (3) creme brulee, not Japanese, but better than the fried ice cream imo, which had too much dough and not enough ice cream.  My main entree was the tonkatsu ramen, which is a bit different than the ones I'm used to. It had pork ribs instead of the usual cha shu, also was on the salty instead of creamy side. Good, but not my favorite.  I'd definitely recommend Umami for the atmosphere, drinks and \"bar food\", it's a fun late night place. Parking seems to be paid street parking.",

The highlights were the pork belly skewer and the branzino, but the sashimi was also super fresh and the scottish salmon skewer was also delicious!! We had to back for round two on the port belly skewers because DAMN they are YUMami. Downside was we got dripped on by the vents above us but I can look past that for a tasty meal!",

It's a little pricey for the portion size and taste.   I want to start out by saying that I would definitely give Umami a 5 if it were slightly cheaper. The vibe of the place alone makes me want to go back multiple times. I may be biased since I love r&b, but the DJ was superb and the fact that they even have a live DJ is amazing. Kudos to that guy for making my experience a lot better.   Anyway, about the food - the first thing I noticed was how great the presentation was. We sat right in front of the sushi chef, so that may have made a difference, but the way he plated and cut the sashimi right in front of us was beautiful. The taste of the ramen was good - not phenomenal or anything, but good. I would argue that it's pricey for the taste, though, but I did enjoy the meal. I would feel bad ordering this at another place with the price, but because Umami has a great atmosphere, it was ok.   Would definitely recommend.",

First you're walking up two flights of stairs and it's like where am I going and then you enter the restaurant and it slowly opens up to this trendy place that makes you feel like you're in New York City rather than Pittsburgh. There's neon lights and you're up a few flights and it's just like, wow this is really cool. Perhaps the best surprise, though, was that we sat at the kitchen bar (which I would highly recommend around 5:00 if you can't get a reservation) and we got to watch the chefs the whole time! It's just a direct view into the kitchen which was so so neat to watch.  Everything on the menu was super interesting and very good. Each dish had its own flair. The menu almost reminded me of a tapas restaurant where it was good to try and share a bunch of different things (which believe me, you will want to sample everything on the menu). I had a great ramen there and the octopus balls were incredible. You really can't go wrong, though.  Such a fun experience overall and I'm still in disbelief that this is the first time I've been here. We will definitely be back!",

The only reason I give 4 stars is because you have to walk up so many stairs to get there, so that means it is not handicap accessible, and you could potentially sweat out your look before even getting to the restaurant. It has a cool hipster vibe and the music is awesome. Was there for happy hour. The food presentation is beautiful and the craft cocktails were delicious. The deviled eggs were sooo good!",

Since I'm gluten free, I wasn't able to order most of the Yatai menu. The one dish we ordered, the Zucchini Dengaku (pan fried zucchini, ground chicken,togarashi, beets, saikyo miso sauce) was a bit disappointing. I just could have done with a little more flavor, it fell a little flat.   You should definitely make a reservation, it's a tiny place and I had to make mine at least a week in advance. I'd caution even more time if you have a larger party.",

We did not have a reservation, but with only 2 people they found us a table within minutes. They don't have very much seating, so I would recommend getting a reservation.  To be honest, I typically lean more toward eating sushi rolls, than traditional sushi. So I wasn't sure what I'd like, I started with a scallop hand roll, which was very good. Our waiter also suggested that we share the Sashimi Plate to get a taste for a variety of sushi... salmon, tuna, yellowtail, fluke, octopus, and striped bass. It was good.  It's a unique place.",

I love the pork belly and bacon-wrapped quail egg from the tayaki menu.   My hubby always does the sashimi bowl which he enjoys and is always very fresh.   We got to enjoy happy hour this past week with a great drink selection and small bites options. The veggie tempura was fried to perfection, light and crispy, but packed with the perfect amount of flavor. Prices for the happy hour menu were on point.   We've walked in on occasion and have had to wait about 20 min or so to sit at the bar in front of grill--I highly recommend getting reservations in advance, especially with a bigger group, since this place gets packed. It will not disappoint.   P.S. If you like old fashions, try the Old Osaka. They use Suntori Toki whiskey, and it's amazing!",

This is a fairly small place and reservations fill up fast so I would recommend to either come before or after dinner rush or make reservations well in advance. Ordered the chicken meatball which was a special and the takoyaki for appetizers. The chicken meatball had a good flavor but I thought it was over cooked. Would prefer it to taste more fresh. The takoyaki was very interesting. I really enjoyed this dish and would definitely order it again. For main course I took the tonkotsu ramen. The noodles were really good and the pork ribs generous but I though the ramen lacked flavor. The soup itself tasted pretty bland. The pork ribs were also over cooked and were on the dry side. The egg that came with it was delicious and perfectly cooked.   Overall, I would come again but probably get different dishes to try. I was disappointed in their ramen as I was expecting this dish to have more flavor.   Also, had asked for some chili sauce as the ramen lacked flavor and the pork ribs were dry and was charged $1 for this. I think that I shouldn't be charged for chili sauce at a restaurant especially when their dishes lack flavor.",

The venue is intimate and decor is nice, perhaps our favorite part of the experience.  We waited a bit for service, a bit of a miss. It was a wait before our server came. I ordered tuna onigiri and robatayaki (squid as the red snapper that is so photographed in these reviews was unavailable) and hubs ordered chirashi. The onigiri comes out. We're perplexed as how to approach it. We're looking around and I see others picking at it, using a soy sauce bowl to dip. Unfortunately, there's no soy sauce bowl or server around. Blah. I attack it nonetheless. It works. Taste wise, it is very average. The scallions were very mild and it was more rice than anything. A soy sauce bowl would have done wonders. I ended up spreading the wasabi using chopsticks. The squid comes as I'm working on the onigiri. Hubs has a few bites as he waits for his dish. I've finished and start on the squid for a bit before the chirashi arrives.  The squid is colder than I'd like, considering it was off the flames. Hubs thought it was his favorite item. His chirashi was very average. It was an elaborate presentation like the onigiri, but nothing that left us wowed.  Service wasn't attentive for us. Another couple sat next to our table as we were wrapping up and they were offered greater service and attention, offered tap versus sparkling as we were given regular tap, without so much as an offer for something else.  No rush to go back.",

I recommend making a reservation ahead of time online since it takes a long time if you wait. The actual place looks super nice and trendy too, but it was SO hot there went I went today.   wagyu tenderloin skewer: was good but the least favorite dish of today, was a bit just too heavy? my friend's skewer was more raw and my other friends was more tough. mine was ok but it didn't make me want to eat it   bacon wrapped quail eggs skewer: love this shit it's exactly what it's called but with an amazing glaze. the bacon is crispy and sweet and the quail egg yolk is so smooth and melty  karaage: the sauce is so good, a bit spicy but also very creamy, it's an interesting take on the typical mayo sauce i'm used to with karaage. and the chicken is nice and juicy with a softly crispy shell! squeezing the lemon is a must also.   pork gyoza: don't expect your typical gyoza, this has a much thicker skin but the skin was so damn crispy it was fantastic!! again this other sauce paired very well with the gyoza  zaru soba: a pleasant and light cold soba. the dipping sauce was a bit sweeter than we liked so we mixed some soy sauce and water to make it a bit more savory. the nitamago (soft boiled eggs) were really good and the salmon skewer was super melt in your mouth.   whole branzino: was very soft and melty fish nicely grilled  deviled eggs: the nori was very crunchy and the egg was smooth.   octopus sashimi: i don't like other sashimi so i only ate this off the sashimi plate, but the lemon peel on it was very refreshing and it wasn't tough at all.   overall very happy with the experience and we basically cleaned the plate on everything!!",

The dishes that stood out to me were the handrolls(salmon, fluke, and spicy tuna), and the skewers(wagyu, chicken skin, salmon, chicken heart). If we ever came back here, I'd prob stick to those because the other dishes weren't anything special.

The chicken thigh and scallion were fantastic.  I have a shellfish allergy, sadly, and cannot eat sushi, but the fiancee says that the mackerel was outstanding, and he gave extremely high marks to the fried balls of octopus (I keep trying to think of a way to write that so it doesn't sound like he was eating octopus testicles).    But the 10 stars, and my newfound obsession with Umami, is due to the tonkatsu ramen.  I really, really, really love ramen.  A lot.  And this is bar none the best ramen I've ever eaten.  I want to eat it three meals a day every day for the rest of my life.    Tips/info: The restaurant is pretty small, which probably explains why it's hard to get a reservation, and you have to walk up three flights of stairs to get to it, so think twice before taking anyone elderly or who can't do stairs - you have to go up and down stairs to use the restroom as well.   It's pretty dark and loud as well, so in short, don't take your parents to eat there.",

    "text": "Less than a month and we came back--that chirashi was calling my name! On this visit, we had a truly excellent server (unfortunately I didn't catch her name) but our disinterested server from our previous visit was just a few tables away. They seem to have done away with the the towel service (or at least we didn't get one), and this time, water arrived quickly and was refilled promptly.  Thanks to Ran's recommendation, we tried the nasu shigiyaki--SO GOOD. There are a lot of different flavors going on--sweet and salty miso, something spicy (possibly togarashi?), and meaty chicken, in addition to the surprisingly nice-textured eggplant. I pretty much only like my eggplant skinless and deep-fried, so this was a revelation (okay, it's still pan-fried). I was already looking up recipes for this while (husband was) driving home.  Chirashi was still good--the cut on some of the fish seemed a little uneven but the place was packed so perhaps there was more rushing than on our first visit. We also tried a few more robata items--the chicken thigh & scallion was great, but the pork belly was underwhelming. We also tried the pork gyoza, for which we have high standards as we make our own. The filling was well-seasoned, but the dipping sauce had a large slick of sesame oil on top which overwhelmed the flavors. They came with the attractive circle of lace from pan flour, a nice crispy addition. They stand up to ours, and are definitely above the caliber of most Pittsburgh gyoza.  Our wonderful server informed us that a new menu is rolling out the first week of July (I think Tuesday?), so I expect we will be back again fairly soon!",

In the meantime it's teppanyaki in Shadyside or ramen in Squirrel Hill.   Drinks were so, so. They sounded and looked neat but were too one-note and watery.   The best thing was the takoyaki. Compared to the two other places I've had takoyaki in Pittsburgh they were actually better here.   Again, hopefully the service gets better, the food had potential.",

Happy hour had some nicely priced options for drinks and small bites.  We had the Yuzu daiquiri and a shot of sake with lychee vodka.  For small plates we had the fried chicken skin which was like crack and I could eat lots of and we also had the deviled eggs which had nice flavor and an extra crispy piece of nori on it which was a nice touch.  I had a chirashi rice bowl which had. A nice variety of fish and topped with some caviar and quail egg yolk.  Presentation was nice.  Overall I enjoyed everything I consumed and would return.",

    "text": "Ok so I am writing a review for someone who enjoys the rolls that come with various stuff in them. Be forewarned, Umami only services sashimi, nigiri and hand rolls, which are just strips of fish, strips of fish on top of rice, or strips of fish with rice wrapped in seaweed. If you are like me, and enjoy what  is apparently an American-ized version of Japanese food, you may be disappointed. I was. Umami has this very trendy vibe to it, so although I should have looked at the menu I was totally expecting something else. I think the food was over priced. We ordered the skewers and each order was one skewer at $3 or $4 dollars a piece. So if you want three skewers or two, you have to pay $12 or $8. The food is small portioned which was pretentious.   I don't know, I just think this place masquerades as some cool hip joint to eat at and in reality the food is like the plainest food and boring and not exciting, so I wasn't very happy with it and I wont go again.",

We had very attentive and enthusiastic service, and the open kitchen really allowed you to take in the smells and preparation. We didn't have a reservation but we were seated at the Sushi Bar right away.   We ordered the pork and shrimp Shumai,  6 open-faced dumplings topped with fish roe and edamame, which was easy to share. Then the Okonomiyaki, a delicious pancake with sweet candied bacon. Last, the Nasu Shigiyaki, Japanese eggplant with nutty and spicy ground chicken. The texture of the eggplant is quite different from eggplant I'm used to, as it was soft but still very good.   Everything came out quickly and practically all at once, which was a bit overwhelming, but appreciated! All in all, a great experience for a new style of food in Lawrenceville, we'll definitely be returning to try more!",

I ordered an array of the skewers including pork belly, chicken hearts, and beef. Pieces of the pork belly were way too fatty to even chew, and the rest of the skewers were just okay. Altogether we ordered a whole red snapper (which was the special), the Japanese fried chicken, the eggplant, the shumai, and both ramen bowls. Overall, everything was pretty tasty. Everything was authentic in taste and the atmosphere was great. I feel something was missing from this place though. I had much higher expectations, but still it was very good.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a unique dining experience in Pittsburgh, Umami is it! Situated up two flights of stairs and using primarily red lighting, it has a different atmosphere than any other restaurant I've been to in the city. If you want a table, definitely make a reservation, otherwise the bar seating is first come first served.  We went at 11:45pm on a Friday night, and I was a little worried that the quality of the food wouldn't be as good so late at night. I couldn't be more wrong! Everything came out fresh and delicious. Since it was our first time, we ordered a wide variety of items, and I appreciated the pace and order that everything came out in. It's really hard to pick, but my favorites from our meal have to be the chirashi bowl (so fresh and such a great opportunity to try fish that I would never pick on their own!) and the spicy tuna onigiri (it was ACTUALLY spicy, unlike the spicy tuna at a lot of other restaurants). The prices for everything seemed really fair given the quality of the ingredients. We tried 9 different dishes between the two of us, and those plus a 24oz beer came out to about $80. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful which is always a good thing. If you're looking to have some really cool Japanese food in the city or impress a guest from out of town, Umami is definitely the place to go.",

The place gets really busy, so definitely call ahead of time and make a reservation. The restaurant is tucked away upstairs in a quiet building - climb those stairs, it's worth it!   Although the menu isn't too lengthy, I was very overwhelmed because I wanted to order everything! We started with the robatayaki - pork belly and chicken skin. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly! The pork belly was my favorite since the little bit of fat just made it more flavorful.   Moving on, we had an appetizer, the server recommended his favorite - zucchini dengaku. It was pan fried zucchini, ground chicken, togarashi, beets, saikyo miso sauce. I'm not even a big fan of zucchini but I can eat this every day! The flavors from the chicken and the miso sauce made the zucchini heavenly.  After that, we tried the sashimi plate, which included salmon, tuna, yellowtail, fluke, octopus, striped bass. It was extremely fresh, definitely one of the most fresh fish I've had. We also ordered the eel and spicy tuna hand roll.   We also ordered the ramen, which I do not recommend, mushy and plain. Let's stick with the fresh fish and flavorful robatakayi. They also offer a wide variety of alcohol, which is always appreciated after a long day of work.",

The atmosphere for this place is everything a millennial dreams of. The DJ is always playing amazing music, while the interior is decorated oh so \"Instagram worthy.\"    I was pleasantly surprised by the price of this place. It's also very affordable during happy hour! The sashimi was fresh and cut into pieces that weren't too thin or too thick. This was my first time trying scallop sushi. Where has this been all my life?! The Hokkaido scallops was a huge mouthful of soft buttery goodness. One of my favorites!   Besides sushi, we got the okonomiyaki and wagyu beef. It was also my first time trying okonomiyaki and it was DELICIOUS. Very filling topped off with okonomiyaki sauce and Japanese mayo. The wagyu beef was a disappointment however. We were surprised by the price when we saw it on the menu, but it turned out to be four pieces on a skewer and burnt. Honestly tasted like something my dad would burn at a church barbecue.   Lastly, we got the fried matcha ice cream for dessert. It was very interesting and would be great for someone with a huge sweet tooth. The toppings were very mysterious to me and was basically sugar styrofoam.   Besides the wagyu and the ice cream, everything was delicious. The drinks were also strong yet bet drinkable and pretty!",

Three pieces one serving. We also had sashimi rice bowl (chirashi). The sashimi were very fresh, clean and delicious. Okonomiyaki (pancake) and temaki sushi were mediocre compared to other dishes. There are better options here.    Service: Open kitchen, you can see the work of the sushi chef. The environment and the service are also very good.   Tips: 4:30 - 6 weekdays are happy hour.

Fresh sushi is hard to find in Pittsburgh, but Umami delivers very well with their fresh sushi selections. Highly recommend the yellowtail if you haven't tried it yet. The skewers were also great, as there were many options, with ample quantities of meat on then.  Atmosphere can be a bit loud, especially with the DJ and lots of people in the small room, but it's a fun time.  Overall, the ability to try a variety of high quality Japanese dishes and an exciting restaurant vibe made for a memorable experience.",

The food is stunning, all carefully prepared to allow you to experience the complex and subtle flavors that are the hallmark of Japanese cooking.  Our server was very attentive, and contributed several helpful suggestions regarding my menu choices.   Several vegetarian options are available.  My only concern is the absence of a Shochu drink option.    I loved the soft Jazz playing in the background, very typical of a fine Japanese restaurant. There's a terrific Japanese ambience overall. Very impressive!",

I would recommend making a reservation as many days in advance as you can as this place fills up fast!  One member of our party was gluten free and our server was able to make great menu recommendations to accommodate (the zucchini dengaku app was the best).   We ordered four apps to share then each ordered our own entree. We were full but not disgustingly so. Every dish we ordered was very good and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals. I highly recommend the Okonomiyaki. It is like a potato pancake appetizer with bacon, broccoli and delicious sauces on top.   To enter the restaurant you must walk up several flights of stairs so keep that in mind if needed!",

No regular seating available, but we got two seats at the bar, which IMO is always a bummer, but in a small spot like this, you settle for the bar seats because it's actually interesting to watch them cook.   We literally purchased one thing per section on the menu because me and my mom DO. NOT. MESS. AROUND. lol but actually we don't. We are pigs. Yolo.   A list of the foods we ordered, rated hahah: - beef tenderloin (9/10) sooo flavorful  - salmon robata (9/10) perfectly cooked, so much flavor  - sashimi maguro (7/10) just plain tuna. Nothing overly exciting  - sake nigiri (10/10) my favorite kind of sushi so duh it's 10/10 - temaki hamachi (8/10) interesting; first time trying raw yellow fish and I liked it - edamame (8/10) a little undercooked but tasty - pork & shrimp shumai (8/10) I liked it. Mom didn't. Idk how you wanna take that. Personal preference I guess bc they're not like normal dumplings. My mom said it's like a meatball hahahah - yaki udon (10/10) SO GOOOOOD ORDER THIS! Such a cool take on ramen. No broth  I recommend ordering one of each if you're feeling like absolutely balling out. It's worth it. You deserve it, tbh. Do it.",

We chose to sit at the bar so we could watch the chef prepare food, which was definitely a good choice  We started with the takoyaki (octopus balls). The only other time I had takoyaki was homemade at a friend's house, so I had pretty high expectations, but this dish was amazing! It was served with this delicious Japanese mayo, and the balls themselves were crunchy on the outside, but a soft burst of flavor on the inside. A must try!  For my entree I had the Yaki Udon, which was also very good, though not as memorable as the takoyaki. I loved how colorful the bowl was, and all the flavors blended nicely.   All of the staff were very friendly and welcoming, and I liked how vegetarian options were clearly marked (there were plenty). I will be back!",

    "text": "I found an abdolute go to spot for everytime I am back home in Pittsburgh. I will now not come back home without coming here.  My friend and I sat at the bar since they are super booked (and I totally see why) and the bar service was perfect.  We both started off with the Cloud - I creamy whiskey cocktail with peach and almond notes. It was delicious. The bartenders are also riddled with knowledge. Learned a bunch of Japanese whiskey trivia.   Wagu beef skewers - what an awesome way to start off for food. It is skewer per order for o my $4.50 and is so tender and bursting with flavor. This is one juicy skewer.   MUST HAVE: The karrrage  chicken is an absolute must have and it is so hard to come by even in Philadelphia. When I do find it, it has always been thigh meat which I do not prefer but I like karrrage chicken enough to put up with it. I think Umami uses chicken breast... so it's like Japanese Chick-Fil-A nuggets or popcorn chicken.  It is so delicious here.   Salmon sashimi (3 pcs) annot go wrong with this as long as you like salmon. They do top it with the salmon roe which I am not crazy about. I'm fine with tobiko though so maybe next time I can ask if I can sub.  Gyoza... another favorite of mine. Unami serves it differently (in a good way) than what I am used to seeing. When they bring it out, it is circular so it looked like a mini pizza. When when you up it over you can see that's where they deal in the filling. So it is like amazing stuffed stuffed breadsticks.   Finished off with more cocktails (Tiki which is Jamaican rum with lychee and violet) and some 1.5 ers of Japanese whiskey variety.   I will reiterate that bar service is amazing and perfect... for those sitting AT the best AND those just standing around waiting since there were no more seats. Most restaurants have this crazy \"no seats no service\" which is absolutely ludacris. Umami has raised the bar... for bar service!  Also... the restaurant is up two flights lol. Go through the door directly I  got of the street entrance door. The restaurant bathroom is second floor and dining is third ;-).",

Finally, we had an open evening, so I made reservations for a Saturday night at 9:30 PM. Umami was truly a unique experience unlike anything else in Pittsburgh- for the evening, it felt like we were in another city.   Walking up the steep steps into the restaurant, you can tell that this place is something special. When you finally arrive upstairs, it has a dark and super trendy vibe. It is pretty small upstairs and was packed by the time we got there. We were seated at a high top table along the window. I loved the atmosphere here- it was very authentic and cool. They even had a room to the side where you sit on the floor during your meal- how fun is that?! Our waiter greeted us right away and got us started on drinks. He was very helpful and informative on the menu since we were all first timers!   After browsing the menu for awhile, we basically wanted to order everything! We decided to start with some of the skewers. The 4 of us ordered the wagyu beef tenderloin, bacon quail egg, and pork belly. All of these were fantastic- but the wagyu beef tenderloin stood out the most. This tenderloin melted in your mouth.  Chris & I also shared an order of the Pork Gyoza potstickers- also amazing! The couple with us shared 2 sushi rolls which were served differently than I have ever seen them. They were served almost like a burrito (not cut) and also had an injector of eel sauce inside of them. They both liked the sushi as well. For our meals, we all were craving the noodle & ramen dishes. The boys both ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, I ordered the Miso Ramen, and my girlfriend ordered the Yaki Udon. My ramen was full of flavor and the small bites that I had everyone else's was also incredible.  We all agreed that these dishes were so unique from anything we ever had and overall outstanding!! If you haven't checked this place out- DO IT!",

The evening I went, they had an extremely obnoxious DJ playing hip hop music at uncomfortable volumes that undoubtedly produce some hearing loss.  I asked the server if they could turn down the music.  They did not.  Another server later asked me to move over closer to the loud music to accommodate a larger party.  I don't think I will be going back.",

My issues with the place were 1-it was hot, we ended up opening an unscreened window for a breeze; 2- for whatever reason, the night we went...they varied between elevator techno music and straight on techno and the speakers were directly overhead.   We will probably come back on special occasions.",

    "text": "Ohh Umami, you have ruined me.  I think it was Tom Collichio who said in an interview once (to paraphrase)  \"we don't sell food, we sell happiness.\"  And if something makes the customer happy, do it.  That's how I feel about Umami.  No question the food is excellent, but that's just the start of the \"experience\" at Umami that makes it so special.  Starting from the theater of entering through a nondescript side door, and climbing two narrow flights of steep steps, you are transported to a different environment.  Your menu remains on the table, supporting the \"order as you go\" style encouraged on the first page of the menu.  There's something subtle and wonderful about that.  It makes the usual restaurant feel somehow industrial.  Please complete your order from this list, and I will submit it for manufacture, and have it shipped to your table.  You will then eat and leave. Umami is nothing like this.  The open kitchen is more theater, and the precision of the chefs is great to watch.  Have a sake, and enjoy some fresh barbecued skewers of smoky wonderfulness, order several, they're small and yummy.  Then maybe put in an order of Okonomiyaki (a terrific Japanese savory pancake).  More theater, as the Pancake arrives with shaved bonito flakes sprinkled over the top, which will gently dance in the heat as it rises from the pancake.  Animated, delightful.   The waitstaff is knowledgable, busy, never rushed, always attentive, never seeming to care if they turn the table (the opposite in fact).  After the pancake, we ordered handrolls, which came with a little pipette of soy which you use to add drips of soy as you eat the savory cone of goodness (that's theater too, I guess, and it's fun and makes the eating better).  And on the night we were there they even had a DJ spinning subterranean grooves and atmosphere, Subtle, and supportive of a place to go to spend time, rather than to just eat a meal.   Others have been more eloquent about the food, and the food really is excellent, but what makes Umami a True gem is the experience.  Umami serves happiness, and I'm grateful to have them so close by.   We've been twice, and it was that good both times.",

It was...problematic to pick around the bones with chopsticks.    Loved our waitress.  Like...literally loved her.  It was hard to leave.  She hasn't called.  Great service, spoke some japanese even.    Very laid back atmosphere.  Cool and new and fun and well done.  Sake selection was awesome.    Ex-PEN-sive.

The service is typically very good too, educated wait staff who are great about giving recommendations etc. The only thing holding me back from 5 stars was the service from the hostess stand during my last visit.  I came with a large party of 7 but it was early in the evening, we had a 5:30 reservation.  The restaurant was nearly empty at that time.  5 of the 7 in my party were there for the first time and the hostess seated us and said \"you know you're going to have to be out of here by 7:30, we have another reservation\".  Super rude and not at all welcoming to either brand new OR returning patrons.  That was disappointing but the food is so amazing, I will keep coming back.",

We decided to try this place only because one other yelper thought the ramen here is better than the famous Ippudo place in NY, which I really like. As it turns out, there is no way that the ramen in Umami is anywhere close to Ippudo's. Two important elements of ramen are soup and noodles. The soup is unsavory, and the noodle is undercooked. Nothing is right about the ramen, except for the egg maybe.  We also tried takoyaki (grilled octupus balls). It was okay, better than the ramen.",

    "text": "I was actually really nervous to come here based on some of the earlier mixed reviews.  Since I chose this place to surprise Bobby on his birthday, I was praying to the restaurant and Yelp gods that they would send us good service AND good food and they did not disappoint!  I made our reservation for 9 on a Friday evening and Bobby was so confused when we got there!  You walk up a narrow, steep stair case to the floor above Round Corner and its like you are entering a completely different world.  It wasn't very busy around 9, but started to pick up toward the end of our meal.  Our waitress was so cute and informative.  She did an excellent job explaining the layout of the menu, any item we inquired about and gave some really good recommendations.  We ended up starting with the quail egg, chicken and shitake mushroom skewers, each ordered our separate entree (I did the ramen with the 5:10 egg...Excellent. and Bobby ordered an eggplant dish with ground chicken and sauce per our waitress's suggestion and he also really liked it), a sushi hand roll (salmon), and the fried oyster dish.  I tried the cocktail similar to a Moscow mule and Bobby tried the pop-rock cocktail and we both had shots of the hibiscus infused sake.  Everything was a 10 out of 10 in flavor, presentation and delivery.  After we finished, we were both comfortably food and not overly stuffed.  Our bill was only $74 for the entire variety and multiple options we ordered.  I think this would be a really cool place to go back for a happy hour or just drinks and small bites, but it was also perfect for a different kind of birthday dinner I knew Bobby would enjoy.  Great food, excellent service and the decision that we will most definitely return in the future earned Umami 5 stars...and that completes my 100th review!",

I will definitely be returning soon :)",

It should not need gravy, especially the type of gravy that goes over mashed potatoes.  Fried oysters were over done and hard. Not delicate at all like I would expect a panko fried oyster.   Pork belly was also overdone.  All of the flavors leaned toward being sweet, and were flat.  Definitely a let down, especially considering the price.",

When I went there around 10p on a Friday night, I wasn't hungry, but my friends got some fantastic looking (and smelling!) dishes and cocktails. They definitely have some gimmicks (such as a syringe to inject soy sauce into a rice ball), but honestly those only added to the experience!   Walking up the stairs to this place, you get a sense of the artistic vision of the owners. The walls are covered in this paper with beautifully intricately detailed designs, but there are modern twists. When you get to the top and turn the corner, you immediately take in an intimate bar with tasteful neon signs and more of this traditionally styled Japanese art with a modern flair. You keep moving further into the room and you notice to your right are a few more tables and a sushi counter, which still all feels very intimate and cozy. On Friday nights they have an incredible DJ who makes seamless blends between different genres and beats--I would go back just to hear more of his stuff! I also can't wait to go back to actually try the food and more fully experience what Umami offers. If you are looking for a cool new place to try or want to impress your out of town friends with something a little different that feels high end, this is your spot!",

I went with a friend, and we sampled many wonderful things. The highlights were definitely the Nasu Shigayaki (pan fried eggplant topped with flavorful ground chicken) and the Takoyaki (essentially octopus hush-puppies). I love unagi, and it was on special when we went. It was prepared like a disassembled unagi sushi roll, with the roasted eel, nori, and rice in patty form laid out artfully on the plate.  The cocktails were pure fun, with names like Godzilla Tears, Panda Panda Panda, and my favorite: Fizzy Lifting Drink! (the Willy Wonka reference works, since this place is to Japanese food what Willy Wonka's Factory is to Chocolate.)  Please, if you like Japanese food or are an adventurous eater, try Umami.",

Our server was attentive without being overbearing, which is difficult to do and always appreciated. The inside was dimly lit and stylish (much like my beloved tako) and it seemed like a fun place to hang out and drink for a while.   I had some yellowtail sashimi and the ginger ginger cocktail. The former was delicious, fresh, and smooth, but the latter was too sweet and lacked the gingery bite I was hoping for. It was essentially a basic Moscow Mule. My dining companion had a cocktail I liked better though (I believe it was whiskey-based) so I will try and get that next time. I also sampled some pork belly, which was chewy and sweet but not for me, and a quail egg in bacon, which I'll most certainly get next time. It might seem like an odd thing for a restaurant with so much sushi, but the savory combination of flavors in that dish was umami at its finest. I'm already looking forward to coming back!",

The place is always packed and in summer time it's getting HOT in there, so be prepared! All the staff was amazing, friendly and very attentive. We had the Nagi Shigiyaki, which is a fried eggplant on ground chicken and it was amazing! We also had the pork gyoza, sushi and a couple of other items. I also had a cocktail to deal with the heat and to accompany my meals and it was delicious! Umami is a bit on the pricier side, but in my opinion well worth it.",

    "text": "Amazing! Seriously this place was so good. I didn't want to stop ordering food. I ended up ordering sashimi, dumplings, and udon noodles. All of which were delicious. I like the fact that you can order as you go but they don't take a long time between each order. I tend to have eyes bigger then my stomach so a lot of times when I go to restaurants where it's small plates I tend to order too many. That was not the case at Umami. I was able to order 1 dish at a time and once I ordered another it was out within 5 minutes so it didn't turn into a 2 hour meal. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the drink I got. The drink with the pop rocks sounded exciting but it was sadly not that great. I definitely would like to go back and try some of the other drinks though.",

The menu was different with small eats and seemed well thought out, so I was excited and really wanted to like it. But dang, the execution fell so short and so far from expectation. I got a chirashi bowl the first tome, and while its not bad, it was not fresh or great in any way either. The second time came with a lot of people, we had cocktails and skewers and my friend got ramen. The ramen was so freaking salty and like i know they'd probably will come at you with the excuse of ramen broth suppose to be salty but NO it does not. I have lived in Japan and had ramen for years and it does not taste remotely that salty. The skewers were just absolutely burnt to the stick, dry beyond chewable, and left your mouth feeling like a desert. sad *in trump*",

Felt pretty undone, but liked the sides and how it was really warm.  Tonkatsu udon was also OK. The udon was meh. I would not recommend tbh. Pricing is OK, everything is just A-OK.

The pork belly literally melted in our mouths. We followed with the tuna, eel, and scallop nigiri. All were absolutely delicious but, as others have mentioned, a bit overpriced for the amount of food (2 pieces instead of 1 would suffice). We moved on to the pork ramen and the miso ramen, both of which were wonderful but the miso ramen is out of this world good. I would have devoured a second bowl. The crispy chili is the key. Fried ice cream dessert was nice as well. Cocktails were nothing special but good (the 33oz Asahi paired better with the meal in my opinion).   I knocked off a star for service. A less-than-pleasant hostess informed me upon arrival that our 8:30 reservation wasn't ready yet (it was 8:30 on the dot) and to grab a drink. No big deal. However, we waited nearly 20 minutes for both the table and two drinks to be maid. Before we could even settle the bar tab, we were being whisked to our table late. Our server, who ended up being great, took nearly 20 minutes to bring water and to even ask if we were ready to order.   The service may not have annoyed some, but it was a weird way to start what was an otherwise outstanding experience.",

We ordered Takoyaki (octopus balls) to start with, which was pretty delicious. We then had a special roll with spicy tuna and eel, which was decent (albeit overpriced at $18), and a number of robatayaki (pork belly, chicken thigh, shrimp, chicken heart, mushroom, and eggplant).   The \"highlight\" of the night (which we sincerely thought would be the highlight) was a grilled whole fish (red snapper). It came out slightly burned and just wasn't that delicious. We didn't finish the entire dish since neither of us liked that dish much, and both of us started feeling nauseous immediately after eating it and especially after we left the restaurant. After I got home 20 minutes later, I literally threw up... My bf didn't throw up but he had to rest for 2 hours before he started to feel normal again.   We have no idea what could have caused the sickness; we both eat a lot of seafood on regular basis, raw or cooked. I also have a pretty strong stomach and the last time I threw up was years ago when I had food poisoning... Maybe this is a coincidence (I do hope that is the case), but we would NOT return to the restaurant again...",

Lighting is very dim and the decor is authentic to Japanese culture with a trendy twist. I did not feel like I was in Pittsburgh anymore!  I started my meal with the wagyu beef tenderloin skewers and the bacon quail eggs. Both were flawless. The beef was incredibly tender and the eggs, well, anything wrapped in bacon is going to be a winner. My next course was the pork gyoza pot stickers. The sesame sauce was very flavorful and the fried potstickers were the perfect texture. My main course was the tonkotsu ramen. Wow! I haven't had many experiences with \"ramen\" other than my college dorm room, but this is NOTHING like that. The pork ribs fell off the bone and the broth had such a great mix of spicy, sweet, and savory flavors. After seeing the portion of ramen, I maybe should have passed on an app or two.   Umami is such a unique and exceptional addition to Pittsburgh's growing food scene. This is definitely my new spot to bring out-of-towners. This could be my new favorite Pittsburgh restaurant!",

I've heard that that they are usually very busy even during weekdays. So check before you go unless you don't mind waiting. One of our friend been there before so we found the place very easy, otherwise it would take me a minute I think. The sign for the restaurant is very different and interesting just not very eye catching. The entrance is on the side-a small door. Then you will need to get on the third floor, when there are couple doors on each floor could be confusing. The atmosphere is very like an authentic/cozy Japanese restaurant that I pictured and seen in movies. They have private rooms(looks like so) for large groups where you will be seating on the floor just like Japanese. I like the open kitchen where you can see everything happening.  Everything on the menu meant to be shared so we ordered a lot for the table to share.  The skewers are super good. It might sounds weird but the chicken heart was the most flavored ones out of pork belly, squalid eggs. The second everybody favorite was the fried chicken, then the squid balls, the pancake, and fried udon. Ah, another must order is their fried gyoza. Out least favorite was the miso soup which had too much seaweed taste. The only thing I could complain about is it was a little bit too salty for my taste.   I would love to go back there try their ramen and everything we had again and recommend it to other friends.",

The maguro was deliciously spicy and the suzuki was succulent! The yuzu deviled eggs are also a fine addition to your dining experience as is the takoyaki, with both being presented beautifully by a great wait staff. There are always fantastic specials and it's great to watch the sushi chef slice and dice at the bar with an ambience on par with the high quality of food, beer and wine! The chirashi is also a standout of mixed sushi selections! The staff does a great job of describing the sushi and fresh fish being delivered to the table and the presentations are really quite ornate! Enjoy!",

Food came out super speedily: shrimp tempura ($10, huge shrimp! different breading than expected but still pretty tasty), chirashi ($18, so fresh! loved the roe and flower decoration and especially the quail egg), miso deviled eggs ($6, tasty but nothing to write home about), and...drumroll please...nasu shigiyaki ($10). It was the surprise highlight of our meal. Delicately spiced minced chicken filled it and paired wonderfully with the softness of the cooked eggplant. It was sweet and savory and once; my dining partner and I both agreeed we would get it again.   All cocktails we tried were well-balanced!   The vibe was high-end/classy without being pretentious. You could definitely bring a date here. It would set the mood well.   We will definitely be back another time to try more items on the outstanding menu!",

The cooked selections - like the octopus balls are quite good and more resoanbly priced. Drinlk list not bad, but somewhat weak/small for my tastes. Overall this is far more of a $$$ than a $$ place IMHO.  The reason for 3 versus 4 stars is the level of service - while our server was friendly, we went 20 minutes waiting for  our first drink order. The food came out in a rush, then another long wait to order second round. when it gets to the point that i'm annoyed, its worth mentioning.   I can't lay this at the establishments feet, but i found the clientele offputting somewhat. Neither my son nor i felt comfortable - and i'm the gregarious sort. Just not our kind of crowd i guess - not really hipster, but a vibe i can't put my finger on.",

The noodle dishes are big enough as an entree for one person, but the ramen is kinda oily. They have good specials everyday so check with the hostess before you order.",

    "text": "My first impression when walking in the door was \"whoa, this is dangerous and confusing.\" The narrow stairway was dimly lit by red lighting, walls were black, and you have to walk up two flights of stairs before reaching the restaurant. Might not be a good place to go to after a few drinks, haha! Despite blindly hiking up the stairs, I loved the look of the place.   We tried some robatayaki (skewers), temaki (handroll), and takoyaki (squid fritters). Of these dishes, I recommend the temaki the most. These small handrolls were quite simple, but the \"injection\" of the house-made soy sauce was delicious and bursting with umami flavor.   The food concept here is small bites of Japanese street food. Prices seem reasonable until the bites are served, as they are literally bite-sized. Expect to spend a good amount of money if you're looking to leave with a full stomach. This concept seems to be on the rise with hip restaurants these days, but I think it's a nice way to sample the menu.",

    "text": "Tonight was my second time visiting Umami, and with the exception of the ramen, it did not disappoint. Since we were only able to get a reservation at 4:30, we were the first people there. The restaurant filled up pretty quickly by the time we had left though, so it's a good thing we got there early!   We started out with some happy hour priced drinks. I got a peach fizzy cocktail drink that came in a bottle and it was delicious. Perfect for a hot day! For our food, we ordered: an eggplant skewer which was flavorful and grilled perfectly, okonomiyaki, stir fried udon, and the pork ramen. The okonomiyaki and udon dishes were amazing and they gave huge portions for the price! The udon especially was unlike anything I've had at another restaurant and I would highly recommend ordering it. I'm deducting a star for the ramen - the broth was not very flavorful and the noodles, while plentiful, didn't have the texture I like for ramen noodles. Pretty disappointing.   Overall, the service was great and the rest of our food was yummy. I will definitely be back for that udon!",

As soon as we got there, we got seated to our table. The atmosphere in this place was nice and relaxing. Our waitress was nice and attentive. To our disappointment, the food was not what we expected. We ordered takoyaki, sashimi platter, spicy tuna hand roll, udon and tonkatsu ramen. The takoyaki was overcooked and the texture was harder than other takoyaki that I've had tried. The hand roll was okay but so not worth $10. I got the udon which Is my go to but the udon was so salty that it was hard eating it. The most disappointing one was the ramen which had no flavor at all. Ramen usually has a really flavorful broth. This ramen had no flavor but the chilly oil and the meat tasted like nothing. We were very disappointed in our food as it was not worth spending over $80 (including tip) for this meal. I wouldn't recommend this place as there are other restaurants that offer better quality of food for a better price but if you're more concerned with atmosphere, by any means try it.",

There was also a DJ making the atmosphere fun.   My friend and I started off with the Robatayaki chicken and scallion skewers. It is a little pricey but was cooked well. Would be willing to try more skewers. I then had the salmon Temaki. I had never had Temaki before and enjoyed the freshness of the salmon. The presentation also made it with the pipette of Nikiri sauce. I then had the pork and shrimp shumai which were standard dumplings. My friend had the miso ramen and enjoyed it. Said it was pretty good for ramen in Pittsburgh.   Finally we had the macaron desert which was a little overpriced for one Mochi and macaron but the presentation made up for it. It was very refreshing and a nice end to the meal. I definitely want to come back and try more of the yatai.",

    "text": "Excellent meal, and great pacing. We ordered and ate as we went which was a nice change of pace. The stairway up to the restaurant was a bit confusing, but loved all the artwork in the darkened halls.  Food: Our favorites of the evening were the Okonomiyaki (savory pancake) and the Tonkotsu Ramen Noodle bowl. The flavors and textures were so spot on. We also enjoyed the spicy tuna, scallion, nori rice ball. The vegetable tempura was good and made well, but will probably opt for something else next time. We got pork gyoza last, and for a moment were hoping it got lost in the fray because we were getting full and it had been awhile since we ordered. We liked the cooking technique, which looked like the dumplings were flattened, but I felt the gyoza were very overseasoned, and the saltiness was even more pronounced when tried with the dipping sauce.  Drinks: We each tried some sake. One hot sake, and a Falling Petal -  a cold draft sake shot infused with Hibiscus. Both were equally enjoyable, with Falling Petal slightly winning in how refreshing and fun it was with the Hibiscus.  The Tickle 'n Giggle with Pop Rocks, Leblon cachaca, basil, coconut lemongrass nigori, lime was fun and delicious. I could not quite figure out how to get the pop rocks into the drink, so I asked our server and she kindly explained how she drinks it. I poured some of the pop rocks on top, which jumped back in my face, and then stirred a few in which complimented the drink throughout the meal.   The  Fairy Tail with cava, sweet potato shochu, beet, ginger, lemon, cardamom bitters was refreshing and visually striking with the beet garnish.",

The restaurant is on the third floor and the bathrooms are on the second floor.    Second- The private room looks so fancy, like it would be perfect for a birthday party, with traditional low seating and curtain for extra swankiness.  Third- The bar is beautiful and long, with an overwhelming selection of drinks.   Fourth- If you are there to eat, sit in front of the kitchen. It looks like the opening scene in Spirited Away when Chihiro's parents eat the food made for the spirits and get turned into pigs. I ordered a bowl of ramen, but  it was so big, I had no hope of finishing it. Also, order the chicken skin on the stick. It is so fatty and yummy, perfectly crispy.   Finally, umami doesn't just describe the food- the cooks certainly fit that description too *wink*",

We headed up a month or so ago to test out their ramen as was recommended by a friend. We were sat in front of the bbq area at a bar top. The place was packed.   The server made it clear that there were more vegan options that what it seemed so she let us know what was up.   We ordered a ramen dish to share and at least 3 appetizers. All were great. \"Super vegans\" may not like the fact that their food will be cooked on the same surface as fish...there is no vegan side to their kitchen so know this before you go and avoid it if your ethics don't allow you for any kind of cross contamination.   Service was quick and friendly, the vibe in the space was young and fun. The place is decorated well and is super tightly packed but it works.   The ONLY downside was that the roof must not be insulated because it was FREEZING in there. We were happy to be sat next to an open fire pit for warmth. We actually avoided going back during the cold snap because we were worried it would be uncomfortably cold.",
