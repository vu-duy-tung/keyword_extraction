We got the Lube Burger with a side of cinnamon baked apples, their new Cheesesteak O-Ring feature with homemade chips, and an appetizer of their hot wings since that's obviously what this joint is known for.  All was wonderfully satisfying but the Lube Burger was really something special.  One of the tastiest burgers I've had yet.  An award-winner, according to their menu, and did not disappoint!  To top it off, fabulous service from Julia.  A great selection of sauces on display that we chose a few samples.  Would love to go back and try more of their burgers and different flavored wings.  A new favorite!",

My fiance got the buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese. My food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either. It was luke warm and the side of mac and cheese was tiny for the price you pay. It was hardly a \"boat\" of mac and cheese as it states on the menu. My fiance's food was at least hot, but nothing over the top. I've only heard good things about this place, hopefully our next experience will be better. The service was great, however.",

They were okay, but not spectacular. The kettle chips and beer cheese were quite good however, as were the nachos.  Stay away from the steak -- it appeared to have been frozen, with pre-made \"grill lines.\" Very disappointing to say the least.

    "text": "I eat at the original in Sharon about once a month, and have been going there for about 18 years now. I've ate at many franchised locations across Pa and Ohio, including Erie, Boardman, Altoona, Cranberry, and Bloomsburg. This one is by far the worst I've ever ate at.   We went after a Pirates game because this location said online it was open until 1am... Only we were told after arriving they actually closed at 11. Not that big of a deal, we still had about an hour for all you can eat wings. The waitresses were beyond slow, the wings were old and tasted like they'd been under a heat lamp for hours, which the waitress basically admitted when they didn't have the flavors we wanted. At the original, they make the wings to order and they're always warm and delicious. We would have been further ahead ordering single orders of wings with as slow as the waitresses were, we could have gotten the flavors we wanted and it would have been a lot cheaper. The waitresses started asking if we wanted our check yet about 10 mins after we finally got our food, and we didn't get refills until we finally gave up on eating there and asked for the check. They then hovered waiting for us to leave, and a 18% tip was included into the check for their awful service.   If you're going because you saw the lube on man vs food, drive up 79 and head west on 80 for about an hour and eat at the original and best location in Sharon. I'm not going back to this one for certain.",

    "text": "Alright so my friends and i are definently wing entuhisasts to say the least  We go to wings suds and spuds, quaker steak and lube, buffalo wild wings, and julianos for wings  Obviously it depends on the mood that your in as to where we go (also the night) Now idk if they have changed how they did things (considering i havent been in the burgh since feburary because of the military) but anyways before i left quaker steak would have a lunch buffet every weekday and on the lunch buffet they would have their hot wings, and la lickers and i think one other flavor i think. Since my favorite flavor there is hot :) i usually try and go during the lunch buffet.   On sundays they have a brunch buffet, which is really good also, on this they have the Arizona Ranch, which i like but my buddy doesnt, then again they also have la lickers and i think one other (usually they try and put a newer flavor out there, or even a flavor they are testing)  Obviously i think this place is known for the wing night, tuesdays. I believe its 12 bucks and you get all you can eat wings. Ive had both the bad servers and the extremely good servers during these nights, it just depends obviously. If you get a good server, youll be eating non stop for as long as you can eat. You get a bad server and you can be waiting a little while for refills on the wings.  Anyways my favorite flavors are: there BBQ is good the Golden Garlic is AMAZING Hot is the sh*t Arizona Ranch is good the Parmasean Garlic isnt bad the suicide taste like straight tabasco xP (gross)  They have a huge menu too if your not into the wings, but ive never gone there for anything but. Ive gotten the magna fries and theyre good stuff also.  Also atmosphere is A+ at all times :) mainly cause im a guy and i love ESPN on every TV  They were trying to promote theyre drive through and delivery service when i was leaving, i was pretty happy with the service",

    "text": "This was my first ever Quaker Steak & Lube experience.  I had seen it before in an episode of Man vs. Food where he did the hot wing challenge.  I came here at lunch time and they do a lunch buffet.  Typically, I am not the biggest buffet fan because sometimes the food seems like it has been sitting out for a while but definitely not this place.  Everything tasted incredibly hot and fresh.  Even the french fries - they tasted like they just came out of the fryer and they were good.  There was a pretty decent selection for the lunch buffet - I sampled the pierogies, some chipped beef, french fries and, of course, the wings.  I happened to like everything.  Very impressive.    On to the wings review.  The wings were served dry, but they had a ton of sauces that you could try out.  The wings weren't breaded, but they were pretty crispy.  I decided to go with the hot sauce and it had some nice zip to it.  I'm not a huge fan of trying all of those whacky sauce combinations, but if you like that, then you will probably like this place even more.  I would actually like to come back here and try some of their hottest wings.  I'm a fan of these wings.  I will definitely have no problem coming back to Quaker Steak & Lube.    Apparently they also have some all-you-can-eat specials on Tuesday nights.  Another plus for me is that they serve Pepsi products.",

The AC didn't seem to be working so well but that could have been because it was literally 200 degrees outside with a relative humidity of 88%. This led to the bathroom floor being like a skating rink which is never a good thing when you have been drinking a few beers. If I fell I would have had to strip down and just throw out all my clothes because god knows what was on the floor.  They have a large selection of food and I went with the pretzel and wing combo yeah that's right big fluffy salty pretzels and wings. Does it really get any better than that? Secondly they have Yeungling on tap but it's Pittsburgh if someone didn't have it on tap I would be upset. The wings were tasty the cheese dipping sauce for the pretzels spicy and the beer was cold.  The service was good even though the girl we had must have had the whole back of the restaurant including the bar by herself. They have plenty of parking available and lots of TV's even though the Pirates Cardinals game wasn't on but our waitress fixed that problem. I would go back to one if I ever saw one again.",

Frustrated and in need of beverages to wash down our hot wings we go to the bar to get some. The waitress finally comes back with our drinks and asks us where we got ours. When we tell her where, she immediately cops an attitude with us. She is rude until we ask to speak to a manager. The manager comes over and we explain the situation. The manager agrees that the waitress should not have handled the table in the manner that she did and tells us she will have the waitress apologize and a round of drinks is on the house. The waitress never apologized and was pretty silent the rest of the time we were there, but more attentive this time. We received our checks and some of us were charged for drinks despite what the manager had told us. No big deal, that is easily corrected. The problem I had with this place was the service and the way that the waitress had treated us like an inconvenience. I had problems in the past with the service at this restaurant and was reluctant to try it again after years of boycott. Safe to say I will not be returning to Quakerstate, especially not the Robinson location.",

I'm guessing this is majorly due to the \"all-you-can-eat\" wings and buffet on Tuesday nights.  The beer specials are just alright ($3.75 22 oz Juengling and another daily special for every day of the week).  Because I'm a vegetarian, I stuck with fries and tried to enjoy the experience.  I wouldn't go all the way out to Robinson to eat here again, but I'd consider stopping in the branch in Oakland (that doesn't have the all-you-can-eat special; those college students would tear that place apart).",

    "text": "This place reeks of something that is not normal for a restaurant, a cross between a gas station and maybe a local county jail.  According to the locals, this was a good place for wings, so here we go. From the outside, I wouldn't tell if I was going to get food or maybe a lube job on my Ford F-150. I seriously think someone was like... \"I wonder what a Green Johnny Rockets which sold wings, in the shape of a Gas and Service Station might look like...\" and suddenly here it is.   Okay, the food...  It's OKAY.  Nothing that was super or amazing.  It's food that you would expect from a place that looks like a Gas Station.     What they call a Compact Bucket, is really just a medium sized basket.  You can split the flavors, which of course they charge 99 cents more.  REALLY? Okay, the wings were tasty, but they were nothing special, perhaps if I wanted to light my fact on fire, I would have asked for the Atomic or Triple Atomic wings, but I doubt that many come here for the food in general, more like the challenge they saw on Man VS Food.   Their menu items plainly tell the story of their theme...a Sidecar of Steamed Broccoli?  More like a small tea cup dish of vegetables.  What about a Garage Salad? Well, this is really descriptive, as their \"Garage\" is their \"House\" Salad, which in terms of following the theme, they are spot on.  The \"House\" Salad is perfectly shaped like an old garage of a Johnny Rockets.    And why they did they call a small order of Onion Rings... Ahem... Short Otenna O-Rings?  My spell-check is going crazy trying to rack it's English Dictionary around how the world Antenna suddenly became something foreign and perhaps going as far as made up.     Oh yeah, those items were mediocre.   Seriously, why?  Sure maybe they are yummy; of course when you have not eaten for 12 hours, they become much better tasting.  Pretty sure this place does well, in locations where their clientele are hard working folk, who are looking at quantities of calories, rather than quality of the flavors used.    You get three stars, because it was amusing to attempt to read the menu, and the garage motif is generously used, EVERYWHERE.",

    "text": "My experience at the QS&L in Bloomsberg was far more dramatic than this outing in Robinson, a suburb chained by...chains!  Kay loves chain restaurants, so here we came Friday night.   I almost ordered the Triple Atomic Wings again, but the week had been eventful enough, and I had nothing left to prove. Although, after we finished our meal, Teresa, our wonderful server, mentioned that I would have gotten a t-shirt out of it.  In Bloomsberg I got a decal.   Teresa thought that was lame also.   Not so lame was the BBQ O-Ring Cheesesteak, which contains chipped sirloin, onion rings, bacon, a cheddar/jack cheese blend, and their signature \"Original\" BBQ sauce all in a bun made for grinders. Sugary, meaty, gooey, and messy, it's the kind of thing that goes down fairly well past midnight with a beer, or in my teatotalling case, a long, tall Pepsi.   One reviewer called the homemade potato chips \"bland and greasy.\" On my end they were perfectly crunchy and salted. *shrugs shoulders*   Being a responsible investigator on Yelp, I skipped the Triple Rich Fudge Brownie (I've already had it) and went for the Caramel Apple Nachos for dessert. For my trouble, I got a wide plate full of freshly fried, sugar-n-cinnamon-coated tortilla chips that were garnished with apple pie-filling and caramel, all of which revolved around a lone scoop of vanilla ice cream.A twist on the fried ice cream phenomenon, I rather enjoyed the wacky chain restaurant creation for what it was; a wacky chain restaurant creation.   And QS&L is the waking definition of \"wacky.\" Vehicles hang over your heads. Kids dine alongside orange-complected, suburban, 20 something females who sing loudly, drunkenly, flirtatiously...desperately along to every female-sung track that plays on the jukebox.  Car antennae hold onion rings.   I know it's a chain, but I liked everything I had. Run me over, now.   But before you step on the gas, keep in mind that I LIKED it. I didn't love it. Ok?",

    "text": "This place apparently serves non-wing related food. If you want a review on that, look elsewhere. For me, this place is all about the wings.   Wings are not hard to make, and I like them in a wide variety of styles: naked (just deep fried with no breading or anything), breaded, or even lightly battered (although naked is probably best I think). Yet so many places screw up the simple recipe of \"fry wings till crispy, toss with sauce, serve\". Quaker gets it right.   First, the wings are good sized and have always been consistently well cooked - crispy on the outside but still juicy in the middle. None of those tiny, overcooked pigeon sized wings that places like Buffalo Wild Wings serve. Second, the sauces are great. If you want your stero typical \"hot wings\", well, you're still going to have to be more specific, because there are a variety of heat levels - mild, medium, hot, supercharged and atomic. Unlike a lot of wing places, Quaker manages to make sauces that are hot, yet still TASTE GOOD! So many crappy wing joints think its all about heat and forget flavor - not here. Finally, a wing place needs character and Quaker has that down pat. Housed in an old gas station, you have a quirky, fun, lively atmosphere from the building, the staff and the patrons.   I would give this place 5 stars, but that fifth star is on hold right now. They have a (supposedly) ridiculously hot Triple Atomic sauce challenge. I've avoided doing it, because so many times I have taken a \"spicy food challenge\" at a wing or bbq place and found that the sauce is just horrible. Bitter, hot without even being spicy - like gargling pepper spray. My next trip to Quaker will be to try the Triple Atomic. If it is as good as the rest of their sauces, I will give them 5 stars without hesitation, and they shall be crowned \"Kings of All Wings\", there will be rejoicing in the streets, and peace shall reign on Earth.",

By the time she made her way back (roughly 10 minutes) I was done with my beer. I had questions like why doesn't the menu say how many wings come in these weird names. I waited too long.

I didn't order fries, but I got the boneless chicken wings (no sauce) and steamed broccoli (without pita bread). My server made a note on my order that it was to be made GF and it came correct. The only reason I say she wasn't very with it when it came to the gluten free choices is that she asked what type of wing sauce I wanted when the menu clearly stated I couldn't have sauce.

It's good... but not \"zomg I have to stop here\" good.  Decor was the best thing about the place - lots of old classic cycles and cars.  It's obvious they put a lot of work into it.    Quiet the night we went (Friday night at 9pm), which we thought a bit unusual.  I had grilled boneless wings with a side of broccoli.  I know, weird combination, but I was trying to stick to my menu plans and I think I did an okay job with that.  I'm admittedly a wimp, so I didn't get the \"atomic flame\" stuff - seriously, eating shouldn't be painful - but I did choose a semi-spicy sauce, Arizona Ranch, which I thought would be okay enough for me to handle, and it was.  I think I could have actually went up a bit on the spice level, for all that. Magna fries were... fries, not much you can really do to mess up fries, you know?  Good but unremarkable.  The wings were good, for sure, and the broccoli was nice and crispy, didn't disappoint there.  I just don't think that it's as great as it's been claimed to be.  Portion sizes were definitely a disappointment - I was seeing people twirl huge amounts of wings in buckets and that's what I'd expected to get, not a small plate with maybe six or seven wings, tops.  Still, it was worth the money we'd paid (maybe 30 bucks in all) and the service was decent, so we'd definitely come back.    Our expectations will be a lot lower, however.  3.5, rounded up because service was good.",

Indeed, no one in our group had anything bad to say about the visit.  More importantly, the staff handled our group of about 40 swiftly and efficiently, plenty of smiles on their faces the entire time, after we'd been seated in a cluster of tables as a group--not spread out around the facility, as often happens.

I look over to my friend to see what he thinks of his food, only to find out that he had gotten wrong order, also not pleased by the taste.

I've even tried the super charged (silly hot) and the Atomic (wet your pants hot). I've never had the Triple Atomic as I fear the pain that would incur (in &  out).   The rest of the menu is pretty meh. Not at all bad, but nothing memorable either. The bar area is nice but not exactly a craft beer mecca. Expect the normal selection of domestics and large imports.   Best deal is Tuesdays for the all you can eat wings &  tacos. A great chance to try lots of flavors with no risk.",

Some of my favorite ones are Louisiana Lickers ( a hot, cajun, garlic and barbecue mix) and Arizona Ranch. (a hot and spicy ranch) My only complaint is that the wings are really, really small.  The wings are so good and then you're pissed that they are all gone!  Tuesday's are all you can eat wings night so that makes it a little better.   The loaded magna fries are great too. Fries covered with beer cheese dip, bacon, scallions and ranch. They are epic! My daughter and wife loved the onion rings. They also have soup, salads, baby back ribs, burgers, steaks and sandwiches.   If you're ever in Pittsburgh on a lay over head to Quaker Steak. They're not far from the airport",

She took our order and brought our drinks quickly and then disappeared for the next 15 minutes. The manager made a table touch with us which was very pleasant and then the food came. It was ok bt as far as best wings in pittsburgh they need to step it up.  However I will come back just to try it again.",

    "text": "So this is a review only of the Tuesday buffet wings.  Quaker steak has been a favorite of mine, from Cleveland to Pittsburgh. The flavor variety is impressive and every once in awhile they cycle in some new flavors. Not too bad given they don't HAVE to do that!  This is the best location in the near-Pittsburgh area (of the two....). Each of the three times I've gone, wings taste like they were made when we ordered, they were plump and juicy, flavors were intense, and they came quickly. Didn't seem like they were sitting around nor taking forever. Dry rubs were dry, glazes were crispy, sauces were wet. Just like it's supposed to be!  And at least for the times I've been, the wings are not sitting around in a buffet line pre-made (like some other places or like the photos suggest). They are brought to you when you order.  Jason's rank order list of Pittsburgh Wings (updated occasionally): - (tie) Quaker Steak (Robinson) - buffet tuesdays - (tie) The Library (Carson) - buffet tuesdays and sundays - Quaker Steak (Pleasant Hills) - buffet tuesdays - Fat Head's (Carson) - 60c Mondays  Jason's rank order list of Pittsburgh Buffets (updated occasionally): top tier - Quaker Steak (Robinson) - buffet tuesdays - The Library (Carson) - buffet tuesdays and sundays - BD's Mongolian bbq  Middle tier - Quaker Steak (Pleasant Hills) - buffet tuesdays  Low tier -Sushi Kim (friday and saturday kbbq buffet)",

They offer a lunch buffet and it seemed most of the patrons were there for that.   Favorite item picked was the buffalo Mac and cheese.  Husband loved it! In fact, I couldn't get a photo because he was already eating.  I liked my boneless wings that came with huge onion rings.  Our son had a enormous hamburger with fries.

It's funny how places which specialize in wings really often fall short when it comes to consistently cooking good wings.  The other food items I have had here were all very good.  Much better than expected.  They have descent specials different days of the week.  Unless you get one of about, 8-10 seats at the bar don't plan on watching the T.V.'s unless you want to strain your neck 90 degrees.    I was thinking about giving this place 4 stars but their claw machine really let me down.  Absolutely no tension strength when grabbing stuffed animals.  Plain and simple, just taking advantage of people.  Nobody should go there expecting to win any type of stuffed animal out of that thing.  It just ain't happening.  Matter of fact, changing my rating to two stars because of this.  Bush League...",

I also forgot how cool the interior of the store was with the various race cars and sports memorabilia hanging up around the store.

We were there for a few hours.  Could the same experience happen again?    Had a gift card and decided to try the lunch buffet since it has been at least two years since my last visit for it.  Waitress was friendly and attentive.  Excellent.  Then we walked to the buffet which is now 11.00 per person.  Options included: salad, French onion soup, hot dogs, pasta, meatballs, popcorn chicken, rice, boneless wings, and wings.  No fries, no additional entrees.  Desert options looked pathetic. They only had four wing sauce options to dip your wings in.  Why only these four?  Wings were very dry to begin with.   It was essentially the Charlie Brown Christmas tree of lunch buffets.  You would have thought they were going out of business with the pathetic spread they displayed.  Waitress was good.  It's a shame how they decimated this lunch option.  It used to be excellent and now this.  I've been on the fringe of not returning multiple times over the last few years.  I think this finally cut the cord.  Best of luck!",

You bill yourself as Pittsburgh and Western PA's premier spot for wings and I've had them at the Original location and at several of my local bars so I just had to try out your buffet.  WHY OH WHY do you only have 'naked' wings on your buffet???  I asked the waitress if I was able to get any sauces and she said, \"They're listed here on the 'basket tissue', would you like me to get you a side of one of them?\"  SAY WHAT???  ONE of them?  How do I know which one(s) I should come back for?  Why don't you have several types of sauced wings on your buffet???  I'm sure you do all kinds of market research and you can very easily narrow down the fav sauces at each restaurant and put a few of those on your buffet, Right?  Oh, you don't want the crispy wings to get soggy?  Then AT LEAST put sauces on the buffet!  And for a wing place- why do you have popcorn shrimp & clams on your buffet?  Burgers swimming in au jus?  And to charge $11.99 for it?  Are you serious?  Have you been to Golden Corral?  $8.99 for their buffet and there's a ton of options!  Now- I understand you are positioning your restaurant way above GC, but GC has wings on their buffet and they're almost as good.  I know I should have voiced my displeasure with my server or manager but I knew it would have stopped there.  This buffet is a disgrace and quite honestly- it doesn't put the rest of the menu in a very good light if this was someone's first visit.  I think you need to either completely revamp the buffet or do away with it completely, because if not, WHY BOTHER?      Reading other comments- there weren't any Boneless Wings on this buffet, there weren't any Onion Rings...!",

    "text": "If you want good wings near Pittsburgh there is at least one obvious choice --Quaker Steak & Lube. Now I won't say these are the best wings in the USA, but the variety of wing sauces & accompaniments is great. And they do know how to cook those suckers.   They have a solid & varied gluten-free menu, and the servers & bartenders are very friendly. So an out-of-towner like myself can instantly feel welcome. I chose the boneless \"wings\" with Louisiana Lickin' Sauce. Not very spicy but the sauce wasn't overpowering either. The chicken was perfectly cooked, as were the fries.   Although QS&L doesn't have any gluten-free beers (boo-hiss) they do have at least three hard ciders to satisfy the thirsty patron with a gluten intolerance. I chose the Woodchuck Amber, and it was icy cold -- just as it should be. If you crave wings as your guilty pleasure and don't want to spend a lot of money, this is a great place to perch. It's about as casual as you can get and still keep your shoes on, so don't worry about puttin' on the Ritz. Food is probably 3.5 stars but service is 5, especially for a casual restaurant.",

The pierogies and boneless wings don't cut it.  And a HOT DOG ROLLER....what am i between 9 on the golf course or at 7-11?I know this place has changed ownership etc....but wings are what you've always been known for.  Be True to the public if you are heading in another direction.  Manager touched my table and service was attentive and friendly (only reasons for any stars).  I've grown up here my whole life and frequented this establishment often bit i'm hard pressed to say i will be back.  It's a shame because my kids love the nostalgia as well as the food but the consistent decrease in quality will not have me back.",

I bit down and I an just glad I didn't break a tooth. There was almost no cheese and way too many mushrooms. It was warm at least.  The fries that came with it were ice cold. My husband ordered a rare 8oz steak. What came out was a tiny little hockey puck that had been cooked into shoe leather. It too came with cold fries.  The worst part was the condescending attitude of the manager. She acted as though she didn't care and could hardly be bothered. She said they would take care of the check. We didn't eat anything at all. We will never bother with this restaurant again.",

I ordered the Cajun - which were listed on the menu as \"hot\" and indicated on the wing thermometer as \"hot\" .   They were mild and not very good.

    "text": "This Quaker Steak & Lube is located near exit 59 on 376 in the Summit in Robinson between Chick-fil-A and Citizen's Bank.  I've never been to Quaker Steak but I've seen it many times.  The first time I've seen one was in Erie near the Peach Street exit.  This place is essentially a sports bar and it's kind of a like a man cave.  Large screen tv's, sports memorabilia, and all sort of food to go along with beer seems to be geared towards the sports enthusiasts and seems like a great place to watch a game.  The menu has many choices from nachos, burgers, and other sharing plates and entrees but if I'm not mistaken they're probably best known for their wings.    My wife wanted to get the pretzels but I didn't want 4 so I noticed that 2 came with a single order of hot wings in a combo.  I ended up ordering two extra pounds of wings as well which were Cajun and garlic Parmesan.  I had also ordered loaded fries on the side which were completely covered in melted cheese topped with chives and bacon.  The wings were large, probably roaster size and all were sauced accordingly.  I was looking to see if they had any dry rub type wings but it seemed all were sauced.  The sauce really defined the wings since it didn't seem there was any extra besides the shreds of cheese on the garlic Parm ones.  The hot wings were perfect heat though.  Any hotter would have been good too but for me, not necessary.  I really like the bite of the Cajun ones and the garlic Parm ones had a nice savory taste.  The wings themselves although large were cooked thoroughly.  Sometimes when you get big wings they aren't cooked \"well done\" but these were hot and steamy with the sauce basically acting as the \"lube\".  This is a great place for the wings and beer type of crowd and I'd most certainly go back to get more variety of wings.  The more the merrier, to get a good variety come with more people.",

Ordered a beer and started looking at the menu.    Wow, what a menu.  I decided on a bacon cheese burger and fries.  Nothing fancy, but the burger was cooked perfectly, and had a lot of flavor.  The fries were great as well.  Q,S&L has a very casual environment, and I saw solo guests like me, families, friends, and older guests as well.

The manager was incredibly nice and our waitress was one of the best I've had in a long time! I do not go out to Cranberry often, but I am glad we ventured that way for this dinner. Our margaritas were good but a little sweet for both of our likings. We had a blue raspberry and desert margarita to cheers off the night! Then, we indulged in some loaded nachos. They were my favorite part! A great portion for two with everything in them. We had the BBQ pulled pork which I would highly suggest. For our entrees, we split the cheesesteak pita and Louisiana licker chicken wrap. Both were good. The fries with their ranch was perfect in my opinion. I'm a big ranch fan so that's the important stuff! Our waitress was attentive throughout our whole meal and refilled our waters on a regular basis. I can't emphasize how sweet she was, making it an overall great experience.",

When I picked them up, the bags seemed light.  When I got home I Planck each bucket on a digital food scale and found they weighed in at just over 2 pounds each...  honest mistake?? No, I called and spoke with the manager.  She claimed that the weight is actually based on a ballpark number of wings not weight...  I call BS.  The website doesn't say 20-24 wings, it says 4 pounds.  This is messed up advertising on their part.  Delicious wings but False it's bait and switch.   Be honest with what you're selling.",

    "text": "Not the best place to get wings in the area, but definitely worth it when you come on a Tuesday for the all you can eat wings.   Being me, and having an obsession with anything having to do with pickles, I always have to go for the Pick Up Pickles. They are pretty much just fried pickles with your choice of ranch or some spicy kind of ranch for your dipping sauce.  The wings are good, nothing special, but good. The sauces are really what makes the wings though. I tend to be partial to the Haute Parm, but tend to also like to get something with garlic in the sauce (usually golden garlic). I tend to be a feen for anything spicy, but for some reason i've only made it as far as the dusted ghost pepper (which was pretty damn hot).  They really don't have anything special when it comes to drinks, but I really wasn't expecting much from a wing place anyway.  Never had a problem with the staff, they tend to be attentive and always willing to help.   I recommend stopping here if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",

Was impressed by the number of flavors they had for wing sauce, but wasnt too impressed with the wings themselves. Kind of small and overpriced. Could get better wings at a pub in AZ. My fiance did the wing challenge and was able to complete it. I ordered 1 of their hottest wings just to try it. First bite - okay hot, not too bad though. Second bite - that's HOT! Third - holy hell my mouth is on fire!! You definitely cannot go back and enjoy the other flavors if you try the hottest wings though. It's like they burn out your taste buds. Probably would come again next time we're in PGH because I love wings, but would come back during their specials.",

The place had the musty smell of beer-soaked carpet that hadn't been cleaned in a while, and the wings on the buffet had the soggy quality that comes when you put once crunch wings in a steam environment for a good long while. I've also visited during happy hour and was a bit more satisfied with the experience, at least the food and beer smells were fresher. But the wings, while competent, weren't spectacular. I've had better wings and a lower overall tab at a number of South Side establishments including Smokin' Joes, Mario's Southside Saloon and Fatheads.",

It may be the best flavor of buffalo style sauce I've ever had.  Thats where the good part of this review ends.   Both visits were on Friday nights around 7:00-8:00 and the place was not busy at all. The restaurant itself is a testament to poor management.  The entire place needs to be cleaned from top to bottom.  While sitting waiting for our order, you can't help but look at all the paraphernalia hanging from the ceiling.  It would all be great except that while looking you notice EVERYTHING is covered in about 10 years of dust including the ductwork.  The tires on the race car look like they are growing hair the dust is so thick. The men's room was filthy and in need of remodeling.  The tables both times were sticky and the carpet is worn with debris all over it.  Meanwhile, there were about 5 servers standing around at the bar talking because they weren't busy.  Maybe they could take turns running a sweeper and cleaning the tables instead of standing around.  I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like if the part of the restaurant customers see is so bad.  I won't eat at this location again.",

The toughest part of being with co-workers is not being able to be yourself. After drowning down my first beer I really wanted another, but would be bad when it's only lunch time? My pencil skirt wasn't letting in anymore room from the wings we ordered. Definitely not the easiest thing to eat while trying not to get anything on your clothes.   Definitely if you don't need to worry about being messy order the wings. Don't bother with the boneless wings, not worth the time to eat. But just a warning this place gives the impression that it hasn't been wiped down in ages. I felt dirty leaving here, and it's dirty in a garbage way not the sexy raunchy way.",

    "text": "For those health conscious people out there, don't shy away from Quaker Steak and Lube. Who knew that a \"wing place\" could have healthy options?! My husband and I ordered take out on Saturday night to take with us to the drive ins. We both ordered the grilled, boneless wings though he got the super single and I got the custom combo with magna fries. I know. It defeats the purpose of being healthy but I'm pregnant so I can live a little. The grilled, boneless wings come in any of their wing flavors and are served with pita bread and a cup of  toppings-tomatoes, lettuce and green onions. The grilled boneless wings are always flavorful and never dry. You're also given the option of having celery and carrots with ranch or cbue cheese for no additonal cost.  My only issue with Quaker Steak and Lube has been their drive thru. Although this Saturday's drive thru interaction was pleasant and timely, in the past, I have not had such good luck. I always call ahead and wait 30 minutes before attempting to pick up my order through the drive thru window. However, if someone is in front of us at the drive thru, you can wait upwards of 15 minutes. No one ever pulls ahead, parks and waits for their food, in my experience. At times, my husband had to go into the restuarant and ask for our food. Defeats the purpose of having a drive thru window if peopel don't actually drive thru! I suggest if you are going to order take out and there is someone at the drive thru window, park and walk in to get your food. It will save you 15 minutes of waiting and becoming frustrated.  Bottom line- the food is worth the hassle.",

Having said that...Quaker Steak & Lube is an outstanding chain restaurant that we do not have in Chicago (sadly enough).  When you drive up to the place, it looks like one of those older gas stations from the past.  When you walk in...it feels like a very cozy nicely decorated places where you can get good grub and a decent beer.  What is so cool about this place you ask?  WELL...They serve BUCKETS of wings.  You heard me right.  I am a fan of any places that serve AWESOMELY tasty wings...and in buckets.  I was soooooo thrilled when I heard about the concept, I sat down and polished off 28 of those suckers by myself...and washed it down with my favorite beer.  I can't WAIT til they open one of these suckers in Chicago...Now...when it comes to chains...THIS IS WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!",

    "text": "I wish I could give this four stars. But. The lunch buffet has definitely gone downhill over the years. The variety was decent, yet the food was still the same. Something I did like was that the wing sauce with no longer on the wings. It was on the side.  They boast of a craft beer selection however, there was only one craft beer on the menu. To me, blue moon and Yuengling are not craft beers even though they say they are. The server was very knowledgeable friendly polite and pretty good. For service they get a five star rating. The lack of a craft beer selection which is boasted about in the drink menu and the quality of the food on the lunch buffet is why I am giving it a three star.",
