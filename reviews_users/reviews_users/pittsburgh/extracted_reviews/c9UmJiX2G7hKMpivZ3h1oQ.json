They're serving the same great pizza with allergen-friendly and gluten-free options and some menu additions... but now you can have those pizzas, wings, etc. served up by a friendly and helpful staff and management team. All of the negative comments I had about Mandy's have been remedied. We're pleased to call Pastoli's our go-to pizza place in Squirrel Hill!",

This is my 7th order from them so far and 1st review I have left.  Very good distribution of toppings on their pie's everytime!  Right amount of cheese that stays on the pizza and a great all-around hand-tossed dough.  Proper amount of sauce so everything holds together.   Many say Mineo's down the street is PGH's best (as I was pointed there) but they are fools, their pizza is a sloppy mess as I have tried 3 times.  Too much sauce, poor quality mozz so a lot of grease, everything slides off your crust.  So, go with a sure bet and go to Pastoli's, you will not be disappointed.",

While the staff was nice, Pastoli does not even belong in the conversation with the slices of heaven at Mineo and Aiello.  The sauce was bland and scarce.  The cheese did not have a nice melt into the crust.  And worst of all - the crust!  It was too thick and VERY doughy.  Cannot speak for their other menu items, but do not go there for good pizza.  Even the chains are better.",

I loved that they thought to ask!  Everything I've had from them has been delicious and my non-vegan coworkers love their food as well. I think my favorite menu item that I've tried is the vegan BBQ pulled pork. Lots of sauce! The \"pork\" is juicy and satisfying and the toasted bun has just the right amount of crunch.",

Not many shops like this one in the city. Their gluten free menu is EXTENSIVE to say the least, and the gluten free pizza is actually pretty good. However, their regular pizza is a True contender to the pizza shops in the city. It's the right amount of salt flavory, cheese gushy, gobbely goop on a pizza. The dough is crispy, yet hearty and the sauce is lite yet potent. It is also a bottle shop, so grabbing a sixer on your way out the door is an option. Highly recommend.",

We've worked our way well down the list, and tonight we finally came to Pastoli's, and let me tell you, we were impressed.    We ordered a cheese pizza in their sicilian style with breadsticks via the online app.  While the app said it would take 45 minutes to deliver, we were pleasantly surprised when the pizza arrived about 20 minutes early.  The driver was polite.  Things got even better from here.  At first I was surprised by the look of the Sicilian style pizza, and a bit skeptical, but a single bite quelled all fears I had.  Put simply: it was delicious.  While the breadsticks aren't going to win any awards, they are as good as I've had from any of the other Squirrel Hill pizzerias.    I would highly recommend this jewel in the already shimmering crown of Squirrel Hill's vibrant pizza culture.  Even our dog couldn't control himself.  I think we're about to go back for seconds -- who am I kidding?  Thirds!",

The staff at the counter are very friendly, a nice change from what this place was before Pastoli's. I had the pasta dinner, which came with a good portion of spaghetti with meatballs, a pretty large piece of garlic bread, and a salad on the side. Everything was great and the overall value was very much worth it. The salad came with a good mix of leaves, peppers and olives, as well as mozzarella balls, while the garlic bread was super flavorful and fresh. The pasta came with just the right amount of sauce with two juicy meatballs. All that for just $10, and if you wanted you could've added another meatball for a buck.",

They do sell bottled and draft beer, but the selection is very small.  I believe there are six packs there too.  The lack of drink for a beer + pizza lover is a bit disappointing.

The best in Pittsburgh in my opinion although my sample size is small (2)",

And trust me, I am no stranger to ridiculously large portions. Despite being a short/small girl, I can out eat many people around me (well, usually because I don't eat frequently enough, so my stomach can accompany a lot when I do, and being an extremely slow eater means I've probably digested everything before I've eaten enough to be full).  In any case, I LOVED how colorful everything was when it came, as well as all the vegetables in the side salad (most are just generic croutons and cheese on lettuce, but this had a mix of tomatoes, green peppers, red onions, olives, banana peppers, and mozarella balls on mixed greens).  The penne pasta came at the perfect temperature and texture. The pesto was flavorful without being greasy in any way and there were HUGE chunks of chicken throughout. The garlic bread had a nice bite to it, and wasn't too overpowering. The sun-dried tomatoes were the sweetest I've ever had, and added another dimension to the dish. I really enjoyed my meal, and it was well worth the price. I will be back to try the other dishes, especially the wide variety of calzones!",

Their mozzarella sticks are insanely good too, the batter they fry them in reminded me of something you'd eat at a county fair-so delicious! By far the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh.

The inside of Pastolis almost reminded me of a coffee shop with a lounge type area to the right with a couple of coolers and then seating throughout the rest of the restaurant.  To complete that coffee shop feel there seemed to be a guitar class or something like that being led by one of the employees in that lounge area.  For dinner on this evening our party of three decided to go with an XL cheese pizza and a small pizza with grilled chicken.  The pizza came out to our table after only a short wait and looked pretty good.  This pizza like all pizzas can be broken down into its three major components: crust, sauce and cheese.  I would consider the crust here to be medium sized although more towards the thin crust than to the thick.  As such the crust had a nice crispy crunch to it while the bottom had a softer texture.  The sauce on this pizza was what shines for me as it had a nice flavor to it although I couldn't tell you what herbs they were.  Last but not least was the cheese of which there was enough of it but it didn't really stand out for me.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Pastoli's has one of the better non sweet sauces in Pittsburgh and I really enjoyed the crispy ends of the crust as well.",

Usually, even good restaurants don't deliver high quality meals via grubhub- I suppose due to transportation time, transferring to boxes, etc. But this meal went above and beyond. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs because it was suggested. Thought it would be a usual simple spaghetti and meatballs, but it was beyond that. Somehow the sauce and the meatballs were just perfect. The meatballs were flavorful and moist, even when I reheated half of the meal the next morning. And the sauce was fantastic. Didn't taste too dry or too salty, which has been my experience with spaghetti and meatballs in the past. It came with salad and garlic bread, which surprised me because usually those cost extra. It surprised me even more that both were INCREDIBLE. I don't even like salads, but this one was great. I expected a few leaves and vegetables, but there were numerous vegetables, mozzarella cheese balls, and the blue cheese dressing was fabulous. I ordered jalapeno poppers too, and even those were great. Usually they just seem like cheap frozen ones that were reheated, but these ones were far better than that. Honestly just a way better meal than a drunk person ordering grubhub alone on a Saturday night deserves. I will be showing up in person sometime soon for sure!",

Reluctant to try Pastoli's in case this was just an owner renaming, I finally stopped in here a few nights ago.  For a pizza place, Pastoli's is shockingly inviting.  There is a big comfy couch and tables.  My friend and I rolled in at 11:15 PM on a Saturday night.  The help was so nice, and our food came out super speedy.  We were instantly served cheese fries ($4.50) that were pretty standard.  We also got an extra large pizza with half tomato and half pineapple.  The crust was good, and they use a sweet sauce.  Toppings were an average amount.  While we did not need gluten free or other options, Pastoli's does cater to those with allergies, which is pretty cool.  Everyone who worked here was beyond pleasant in their interactions, and the pizza was quite good!  On top of that, as they close at midnight, the staff did not rush us at all.  Very impressed!",

The gluten free crust is delicious and the regular crust looked even better. Yes, they can put fries on your pizza (I guess it's a Pittsburgh thing).   Overall we were very impressed by the level of customer service and the quality of the food. We highly suggest Pastoli's!",

Now, I am a buffalo chicken *loverrrrrr* but recently have been trying to pursue a vegan lifestyle. When she told me that they had a vegan buffalo chicken pizza I was hesitant but curious.   Wow, you definitely wouldn't be able to tell that it was vegan! We enjoyed our pizza there, piping hot, and were only able to finish one slice it was super filling. It even reheated well in the oven the next day!  This was my only visit there so far, but I cannot wait to go back and try the rest of their vegan options, as there were many!",

Sandy was able to get a pizza with pepperoni and some veggies, and got a steak hoagie to take home for lunch during the week.

As a vegetarian, having vegan options for sandwiches and pizzas is amazing. I ordered a vegan wedgie and was a little disappointed in how tough the bread was. It was hard yet really chewy and just overall challenging to get through. I didn't let that stop me though because it was still delicious and I went back a second time!  The pizza is also really good. We had just a plain vegan cheese pizza and it surprisingly didn't taste like cardboard. It had good flavor and was very filling.   Staff were really nice and the wait was not long. Looking forward to trying more options!",

I got the buffalo chicken pizza on a Sicilian crust. I love Sicilian so finding some in Pittsburgh that are good is key. I enjoyed the crust however, (and maybe this is my fault) but the buffalo chicken on the thick crust was almost too much because they put french fries on the buffalo chicken pizza. I would definitely go back and try their regular pizza though for sure.   I also enjoyed that it didn't look like a pizza shop and there was a little group of people casually sitting in the couches playing instruments. Would definitely recommend to others.",

Look over the gourmet pizza's at Pastoli's and you will find that all of them have fries on top of them.  The Spicy bird is very spicy.  It comes complete with habanero mustard sauce and lot's of large slices of jalapeno's in every bite.  The baking of pizza in a 400 degree oven doesn't take away the zip of those jalapenos.  It is just too spicy and not interesting enough for me to be worth the bucks I have to shell out for pizza at Pastoli's.  You think they are being creative, but it is nothing that hasn't been done before in so many different places that it is a little bit tedious.  It is not the worst pizza, but it is not worth the extra money for pizza that is just an ordinary slice.     I took a look at the receipt and here is what it read, \"glasses\" Eat In.  This was there cute little way of remembering who I was because that night I wore glasses.  So, if someone heavyset who is tired and hungry comes in and orders a pizza, what do they put down?  Fat/Sleepy Eat In?  It is funny, but also, if I didn't have a sense of humor, down right offensive.   Oh, I had the vegan pizza, the regular kind is pretty lame.",

Every pizza place deserves a chance so I decided to see what makes this place any different than the scores of other pizza places located in the area. Anyone who is willing to enter the ring with Aiello's and Mineo's nearby earns my attention.   First impression:  It doesn't look like a pizza shop. The warm lighting and comfy seating throughout reminded me of a coffee cafe.  Never hurts to look inviting whatever you are selling.  I was quickly greeted and asked for my order.  I decided to go with a few slices of pizza they had ready.  I picked up the pizza box and immediately realized these are not wimpy weighing  slices at all.  I needed two hands to carry them!  The pizza tasted good and it is certainly worth another visit in order to try out some of the other menu selections.  Besides offering their traditional and specialty pizzas they serve a nice variety of  allergen-friendly, vegan, and gluten-free menu items.  More so than any other pizza  place I have seen.  The starters include fun things like corn puppies and the amazing queso sticks.  Salads, hoagies, wedgies, wings, calzones, pasta dishes are also available.  They even have a few dessert choices.  Caramel cinnamon puffs sounds like a nice finish to your meal.  I thank my friend for the recommendation and hope to return to Pastoli's soon.  I suppose a little competition never hurts anyone.",

That's what took us to the squirrel hill neighborhood; and I can't wait to return to this place again and again.  First and foremost, for a little pizza eatery and beer shop, it has some kickbutt pizza. We opted for the Sicilian style; but they also have regular, gluten free, Allergen friendly, and vegan options (pizza, pasta, and many other choice of items too).  I picked up a single bottle of beer; though they offer 6 pack carry out beers too (mix your own or buy a non mixed 6 pack).  I'll be back many times as long as I live in the neighborhood!",

With the exception of a special trip to Spak in Garfield, I had pretty much resigned myself to a pizza-less lifestyle. All that changed when I stumbled upon Pastoli's a few months back, and I cannot overstate how happy I am to be able to regularly order delicious pizza again!    They offer vegan cheese and an array of toppings on regular pizza crust (bruschetta and black olives are my favorites) but also have options for the gluten-intolerant and those of you who don't have dietary restrictions. The special pizza are prepared separately, so I never encounter issues with cross-contamination. They deliver via Grubhub, and my food has always arrived hot, fresh, and within a reasonable timeframe. (I live in Shadyside, so I'll admit I have an advantage there.) I hope Pastoli's sticks around for years to come, because I'm certain I'll be a loyal customer as long as I live in the area!",

The pizza itself was above average and it's great that they have vegan options BUT 30+ dollars for two small (i.e. slightly large personal pizzas) was a lot!   We did get delivery so that raises the price, but still that is very high! Still enjoyed the pizza I just wish we knew the size before we ordered.",

The wing flavors are solid, the cook on the wings, slightly above average.  If I could give this place 3.5 stars I would. It's better than most pizza options on Pittsburgh and Oakland but can not compare to Mineo's, Aiello's or even the non pizza campus deli.",

Delivery timeliness 5/5 - it normally takes forever for me to receive my order in the my past from other restaurant   Pizza 4/5 - I only had their meat pizza and it was pretty good. One thing that pretty much made me give this place 4 instead of 3 is that it is not Oily at all!!! Can you believe it?! Non-Oily Pizza! It was the healthiest pizza I ever had.  Probably will go back again",

I ordered a small white pizza and a order of loaded potatoe skins.  I picked it up in about 20 minutes and the white pizza was perfect. The dough was airy but not too thick, tomatoes were fresh and there was an ample amount of cheese. The potatoe skins stole the show though!  I've never had or even thought about deep frying my skins but obviously they have and it was amazing!  Seriously I would drive across the city just to get the potato skins",

For lunch, we ordered a Sicilian pizza to share with friends, and a gluten-free pizza and wedgie for her. We brought it to our friends' house, and it all tasted great! The gluten-free crust was one of the better ones I've tried, and the regular pizza was really good and cheesy.  Great place for pizza, especially if you're gluten-free!",

We were going to pick up really quick and head back home, about 35 minutes with the traffic, back to South Park.  We picked up the pizza from one of the friendly staff, Mary Ann. We took our 2 pizzas and were on our way home.  About 10-15 minutes in to our drive I get a call. It's Mary Ann, telling us she gave us the wrong pizza! I didn't feel like driving back and adding 30 minutes of commute on to an already long day, so I told her don't worry about it. She informed me that one of the pizzas caught in the mix up was vegan, and she insisted on driving out to my place to give us the correct pizzas.   She showed up with the pizzas and was incredibly apologetic. I take my hat off to the wonderful customer service in correcting the mistake with the pizzas. It just proves that this is much more than an excellent pizza place, and they care deeply about the satisfaction of the customers.  The pizza is amazing here, and my mom loved it! I can't speak to the vegan pizza, as no one tried it. If you're in town, do yourself a favor and give this place a shot, you won't be disappointed! Also, give a shout out to Mary Ann, she is great!",

So for my birthday I wanted a mellow night in and some yummy pizza. We ordered around the pizza around a quarter til 9/9pm. We ordered the feta and spinach pizza, with a couple of add-ons: tomatoes and onions. It was quoted to arrive around 945/950. Well, about 15 minutes before it was supposed to arrive the estimated time was changed and an additional hour was added. So when my boyfriend called back, they said it was about to head out the door. He checked to make sure our add-ons were included.. The pizza shows up at 11, barely warm and then the delivery guy complains at me to grab the pizza, to pay an additional $6 because they didn't include our add-ons, and then as we turn to shut the door, the delivery guy complains about the state of our road and how snowy it was (it wasn't). I was very disappointed in this experience, especially being new to the city and trying to find new places near me to be able to frequent.",

    "text": "My buffalo chicken salad was prepared just as I asked (no onions) and was delicious.  The buffalo sauce was spicy, but not over-powering.  The chicken tenders were cooked perfectly.  The mixed greens are what a salad should be made of (not your typical iceberg mix from a bag).  My favorite part was the fresh mozzarella balls.   Chris and his staff truly want their customers to have a good dining experience and it shows in the quality food.  Bad days happen to everyone and that is how I would classify my first visit.  Today's experience was wonderful and they have earned a repeat customer!",

    "text": "As a NY/NJ transplant to PGH who takes his pizza seriously I was always on the hunt for a great, simple pie. After recently being diagnosed lactose-intolerant that hunt was made even more complicated. Read about Pastolis and was excited to see pizza with dairy-free cheese. Walked in and split a pie with my boyfriend (also a NY/NJ transplant) and we were both instantly thrilled. Without a doubt the best crust on a pizza in PGH AND being allergen friendly makes Pastolis now my go-to for pizza. Great service, diverse set of toppings, and six packs to go! Will certainly be coming back.",

    "text": "We ordered 2 pizzas today, vegan and non vegan. After we got home, plated them and started to eat, I realized that my VEGAN PIZZA HAD REAL CHICKEN ON IT. I had my boyfriend examine and taste it, as he is non vegan, and he said it was REAL CHICKEN. I have eaten there numerous times, and have NEVER HAD AN ISSUE, but when I called today the girl taking the orders did not seem like the usual girl that is there, the nice one. We called them back and were told there is no chance it could be real chicken, no remedy was offered nor was an apology given, and she seemed bothered as well as no manager to take the phone from some one who has no customer service. It was like I was in The wrong. The vegan chicken is usually strips, and this was chunks of different sizes. Had I continued eating it, I would have gotten very sick, and the bbq sauce was very messy on it when it's usually very neat. I will not be going back, which is a shame",

I do love the pizzas here, but better communication would have made today's visit much less frustrating.",

We ordered just from the gluten free and vegan menus, but you'll find a wide range of menu items from pizza and hoagies to wings, fries and other dinner offerings. I'll focus on our order: gluten free & vegan pizza (no gluten or dairy), gluten free wings, gluten free wedgie and two gluten free hoagies. First, I should point out that they were extremely helpful while ordering and very attentive to the specifics (gluten free, vegan, etc.). This is a very welcoming business. I didn't wait very long for the order and they got everything right - no mistakes. As for the food - very good. Very nice GF pizza crust and rolls. Wings are excellent. We'll definitely be back. I'll add that Pastoli's is easily found along Murray Ave and there's a nice area with tables if you'd like to eat in. They do take out and delivery too. If you're gluten free, this is a very cool place.",

I was told they had cooked them and would not be given my money back.  Anyone who goes there customer service is a joke.  Six people working there, 1 table of customers and they can't come up with two cuts???    I cant wait to see this place go out of business!     In responding to business owner Chris R's rebuttal..... he agrees that his restaurant was at fault in not telling me how long it would be to receive an order of two cuts to go.   There were not even 10 people in the restaurant at any time of my wait that was at least 25 minutes for two cuts!!  And the man would not give me my money back when I told him I was tired of waiting?   As I live in Sq Hill I have gone out of my way to relate this experience to friends and family as to how out of line you were.  You lost more than 20 peoples business already and that number will grow.  Enjoy the $4.50!!!",
