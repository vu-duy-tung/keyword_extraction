It feels like you're transported about 80 years into the past (in all the right reasons); the Pear and Pickle feels like you're joining a friend in their parlor for a coffee and breakfast. I just love the aesthetic, not to mention they retained the original built-ins in what used to be the old home's dining room. And you bet it's stocked with antique place settings. Onto the food. My gosh. The burgers here were quite tasty. I got the regular burger will all the fixings. It definitely didn't disappoint, especially with Mancini buns-oooh weee!!! Grilled with butter--always a win! We happened to stop in when Roundabout Brewery was doing a pop-up, so we were able to pair our burger with a delicious beer. Definitely will return--anxious to try their breakfast sammich.",

The middle section has a book and game shelf and has a larger table with beautiful fresh flowers.  The front of the store, where you order, has plenty of charm and sunshine.  The menu is one chalk boards above the counter. They serve breakfast all day. Their hours are short but the food is very good.  I've gotten both a custom ordered sandwich and breakfast sandwich.  They have a really selection of fresh breads and cheeses which I appreciate.  Come here for simple but good meal. They have a wonderful selection of homemade desserts and cakes as well as ice cream sandwiches.  The fellow behind the counter is all business.

There are three separate rooms to eat and hang, a mini grocery store with lots of basic and not so basic items and of course the kitchen. Everything is cooked right behind the counter.  I had a chicken sandwich and it was awesome! Not only was it delicious, but probably one of the biggest chicken sandwiches I've ever eaten in my life. They garnish it with the right toppings!

I got the Reuben (that day's special) and told myself I was going to take half to go, which was a total lie. I ate the whole thing and enjoyed every bite! Definitely made with quality ingredients & love. Also got a house drip coffee which came with a free refill. Yum.  Came here to get some work done, which there is plenty of space to do. I do wish it was open later, but maybe I should just wake up earlier... Had some trouble connecting to the Wifi and they were SO helpful! I've been places before where they're like 'oh well, we're not tech experts!' which I get, but it bums me out when I'm trying to be productive and can't. Anyways, they checked in on me a few minutes after I got the internet password and I explained it wasn't working. Then they fiddled around a bit, came back over and helped me connect to another network. They were super apologetic, understanding and overall just cool. Real people helping real people!!   Thank you! I will definitely be back to hang out more!",

The moment you walk in you can smell and see them cooking on the grill right behind you, often the owners themselves. They have great coffee and teas with house made syrups that are just so good. It's very homey and they have a large selection of complimentary books to read as well as some household items for sale. A nice and thought out assortment of seating, which I appreciate. I am also excited to try a dinner series there this year!",

First, the neighborhood: it's great to see a place like this in Troy Hill and Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is Pinterest-perfect, magazine ready, and comfortable. It was full, but not crowded. Bustling, but not loud. Iron & Wine, one of my favorites, was playing on the stereo while I was there so they get a star just for that. The coffee was quite good and you get a free refill. The breakfast sammie was stellar, really everything you could ask for in a sandwich, but the star of the show was the bacon tho.  All in all, this is the kind of place I'll take people when I want to show them what this town is capable of.",

She actually appeared to be angry when I asked a few questions.

There are spaces for groups, places to read a book, spots to work from a laptop.   If you want to get to know the owners, they are eager to welcome and get to know you. Community is present here, and you are invited to be a part of it.   It's a unique place, and you can tell I love everything about it. The owner was planning on selling more groceries, but is moving more towards focusing on the food and beverages.   Oh, but the desserts! Make sure you leave some space for the amazing sweet treats. Really great cookies, cakes and pies.   The only thing left to say is to not put off your visit here any longer!",

The deli menu on the day we went consisted of tuna sandwiches and reubens, and we went with the reubans, while I also got a cappuccino. The reubans were delightful and did not take too long.  There are three separate rooms with space for seating. One room holds a bookcase of books to read and games to play. Furniture and walls are very reminiscent of home--even with cases filled with china/fine plates.",

I waited in line watching the 2 bicker. When I was second in line, the man rudely asked what the person wanted and in my opinion, was unprofessional. I did not feel like eating food prepared by disgruntled workers and wait even longer for the food to be prepared. I walked out hungry.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place out for a long time and I finally got an opportunity to do so. It appears to be a reconverted first floor house with a small selection of groceries in the front. They serve both breakfast and lunch here along with Stumpton's fresh roasted coffee. I decided to opt for a turkey Reuben and a small chocolate chip cookie. They do offer an all vegetarian sandwich.  I also went for a spiced iced tea which had a bit of a zing to it. After I ordered I was told to wait until they called me by name. It gave me a chance to explore the place. In the center area is a beautiful dining room table and behind it is a wall full of children's books and games. In the back room were more cafe tables for people who were working. There was also some seating in the front area.  I got my food on a lovely dish you would get visiting someone's house. I ate in the big dining room just to soak in the atmosphere. All the chairs surrounding the table were different. On to the food. The turkey Reuben was moist and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The small chocolate chip cookie I got to go with it seemed dry and reminded me of a store bought brand. Still it is a nice place to check out when you are in the Troy Hill neighborhood. Parking can be difficult since only street parking is available.  They were selling the coffee by the bag and I learned that it was not flavored. It smelled good so definitely want to check that out on my next visit.   I didn't price the groceries since there wasn't much of a selection. Next time I visit will opt for a breakfast sandwich.",

At first I was a little taken back by that price ($8 for the sandwich) but it was phenomenal! Loaded with delicious turkey and Swiss with added house made aioli. Totally worth it! Filled us both up for lunch.  The space is really cool too. Most of the tables are long so you might sit next to a stranger which worked for us because we got to talking to people and had a nice conversation.

Soft bread, egg with a runny yolk, peppered thick bacon, it was the perfect combination- my husband who's more of the breakfast sandwich connoisseur said it was one of the best sandwiches he's ever had. I also got the cold brewed coffee- sourced from Stumptown in Portland and that was delicious. The space is very light and bright, but I'd recommend grabbing a table before it's gone, it got busier as we were there and we had to sit in a back room.",

We ordered two breakfast sandwiches and fruit, granola and berries. We had coffee and an americano while we waited for our breakfast. They offer a variety of cafe drinks. We loved the sandwiches. I had mine on a homemade biscuit. The biscuit was a little too much bread for my preference, but still very tasty. The granola seemed to be homemade as well.   The service there was quick and we really enjoyed hanging at the farm tables. The environment is really inviting and cozy.

I was excited to check it out, as I do not make it to Troy Hill that often and I very much love this part of Pittsburgh. It's so unique and special... so when you visit Pear and the Pickle, make sure you make time to also check out the neighborhood! I went with an almond milk latte and Brendan ordered their drip coffee. He liked his coffee and I enjoyed my latte as well. I also ordered a 6 inch troy hill turkey sandwich to go- it was delicious. The pickles, the peppers, the cracked turkey piled high and the garlic aioli.. it was super tasty and filling. Their menu is quite large and they have something for everyone- gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, whatever! The cafe is much larger than I expected- there is a ton of seating throughout the cafe, making it a good spot to get work done or study. I love the wall of books in the back- it was a lot of fun to go through them while waiting for my order. Overall, I really enjoyed this place- it's definitely a gem in Troy Hill and I am excited to come back!",

I had no plans to end up here,but thanks to a major back-up on the roadways, and the pouring rain, I opted to take an alternate route.  Thanks to Yelp, I realized I was in the same area Pear and Pickle was located.  Definitely a seize the moment decision for me, so I decided to stop.  What a cozy, and very welcoming encounter you experience as you enter into the doorway.  I love the decor and that comforting vibe it gives off. Too quaint!  One can't go wrong with the menu options they offer either.   Breakfast, salads, soups or sandwiches are freshly prepared.  I like being able to put together my own meat , cheese and topping pairings if I want something other than their signature sandwiches. Coffee and tea is available as well.  Pear and Pickle is a great place to experience on a regular  basis.   Not only did I enjoy my lunch, but I learned a little history as well.   The name Pear and Pickle traces back to the time when there were pear orchards growing nearby, and when the neighborhood had connections with the local Heinz Pickle plant.",

    "text": "I walked up to Pear and the Pickle and saw a gold  pear as their logo and thought... these guys get it.   The whole place was gold!   Not literally.   Figuratively.   I went on a Saturday morning and got a breakfast sandwich and a cup of drip coffee. I ordered a sausage, egg, and cheese on a brioche (I think) (\"I think\" there is about the brioche, not the type of sandwich as a whole. It's important I make that clear because the sausage egg and cheese was not forgettable. It was memorable. The bun was too. So, don't let this confuse you either. I just don't always know the proper names of breads. It's my fault, not the shop's. The taste...the taste I'll never forget.)(Thanks for allowing me to clarify).   Best breakfast sandwich I've had in the city. Mark it.   The coffee was okay, not the greatest I've ever had. It's okay. You also get a refill on the mug of drip. I'll go back to try espresso.   The inside was incredible and the design style was something that should attract people. It's like Ace Hotel styling. Trendy. Cozy. But artsy. They put a lot of thoughtful work into the space, and I appreciate that in an independently owned business.   The owner took the time to introduce himself and to give a history of the business, their journey, and their ability to pivot based on customer needs. They started wanting a heavy lean on coffee -  coffee shop that sold some food. But the pivot has occurred where they're a food place that sells some coffee. I think there's still some figuring out to be done there, but you can tell an honest person who wants to improve and add value to a community when you meet him/her. Pear and the Pickle ownership is in that category.   There are some random groceries sold in the space to pay homage to the building and what it was as a general store. Awesome once you know - yet confusing to see random items when walking in.   It truly was a great experience. They have a nice deck I want to try once the nuclear winter passes. It's good for conversations, and I'm not sure I would come with my laptop to post-up and work. That would be weird, I think. A breakfast date or a get-together with friends, on the other hand... perfect!   What's ironic is you'd be in a pickle if you didn't go to Pear and the Pickle...and you would also be in one once you got in there. But the latter is what you really want over the former!!",

The space, which used to be an old hardware store, was so inviting. The long wooden counter with fresh cookies and croissants and the menu of items listed all looked and sounded so delicious. My husband and I split a breakfast sandwich and a lunch sandwich and both were so good. Everything was quality and the staff was so helpful.   The tables available for seating were mismatched with various different chairs pulled up to them, but it worked so well. It was so cute. They had 3 small rooms downstairs, and upstairs led to a neat patio that I will be coming back to sit on during the warmer months! I can't wait to return and try some more delicious things.",

    "text": "This place is unique to Pittsburgh and I'm glad I finally got to try it. I came here on a Tuesday morning with my girlfriend for a coffee and breakfast sandwich. I kept reading reviews and saw that seemed to be the most popular menu item.   I ordered a regular coffee the sausage breakfast sandwich and added tomatoes. I questioned adding the tomatoes because they were 50 cents extra? Who charges extra for 3 slices of small tomatoes? Were they organic or were they a rare tomato grown out back? I just don't see the point in up charging for something like that. The sausage on the sandwich was just a regular patty. Nothing I'd never had before. It wasn't fresh homemade sausage, it was probably something prepackaged (excuse me if I'm wrong.) I was not impressed. If you're going to ask someone to pay 6 bucks for a breakfast sandwich then meat should (all) be fresh.   My total was $10 and some change.  For a coffee and sandwich it was ten bucks? I'm sorry but that's over priced. My coffee was also forgotten about and there was maybe 3 people in the shop. I went up to the counter to get it and the owner went to get some and they were out. He asked if I would just have an Americana and I'm not picky so I was fine with it.   Who runs out of coffee at a coffee shop when there are only 3-4 patrons inside?  I'm happy I came to try out a new local spot but I'd probably not return.",

As I entered, I was welcomed with the sights of many people enjoying their food, cute vintage signage and stylish people working hard behind the counter. I knew this place was going to be good just based on my first impression of it.   Everything is super kitschy here and really fits the  vintage vibe. This place is incredibly welcoming and not at all pretentious. I think the owners really knew how to craft a feel good, neighborhood destination. If I lived closer, I could see myself going here at least once or twice a week.   Regarding the food, I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it did not disappoint. The garlic aioli inside definitely makes the sandwich. They do not skimp on the proteins here! My sandwich was generously packed with the highest quality fillings. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. The chicken was perfectly cooked, very tender and dense. The bread that housed all the ingredients was the most perfect texture. It was slightly crispy around the edges however, towards the middle, it was fluffy and spongey. I typically never order grilled chicken sandwiches because I prefer my chicken fried. If I could choose a grilled chicken sandwich from here or a fried chicken sandwich from anywhere else, I would choose the grilled chicken. It's that good!!!",

This was probably one of the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had. It had the perfect amount of grease (in a good way!) and blending of textures and flavors. The bun had been buttered and was soft to the touch with just a little crunch from the grill. The meat had been clearly hand pressed- not a frozen patty- and the egg and cheese melted together. Since it was basically the size of a burger, it kept me full for most of the day!   There are three rooms in Pear and the Pickle with varied seating, each gets a little quieter as you go. Seems like a great place to get your morning coffee or have a (small) book club. They had some board games in the last room.  I will note that it did take about 20 minutes for our sandwiches to come out which felt a little long. I have not tried other items on their menu but I would return for this sandwich alone!!!",

As is True with most breakfast spots in PGH, bagels are (apparently) hard to come by, but I was still a little surprised when my breakfast sandwich came out on a potato bread roll. Otherwise, my obviously fresh sandwich was delicious and included some very thick slices of bacon, well melted cheese, and a perfectly grilled diner fresh egg. I saw the benefit of going on a weekday, as the place was close to empty with adequate seating and spaces to work or socialize. While they played decent music in the shop, it was much too loud to allow for much conversation. I suspect this changes or is overwhelming during the weekends or when the shop is much busier.",

There's just something about their fresh sliced bacon smothered with cheese atop a fried egg on a potato bun that makes me drool thinking about it. If I'm being honest, I've never been able to bring myself to try anything else because it's just so damn good. They serve Stumptown coffee if you're into that sort of thing. The road to get their is a steep and narrow hill but there's typically parking in the surrounding neighborhood.",

We walked in and the place was packed but they had posted \"summer vacation starts at 12noon\" and refused to take our order. \"Sorry, we've taken our last order for the day.\" Oh, but you will happily make to-go coffees for other people. If you're not closed when we walk in, the least you could do is offer us the chance to order from a small subset of quick to-go items. Shockingly inhospitable and not at all the friendly Pittsburgh vibe I would've expected. If you're that unable to serve someone at 11:50 AM, just don't bother opening for the day. Steer clear of this place, you might encounter the same rude treatment.",

I love the looks of this place its so vintage is the only way to describe it  front is the girl a few tables and a few household items the use of the name Market in the title is stretching it a bit thought they do have laundry soap and a few canned items ...its not really a market though it does look like it might have once been back rooms are cozy places with a big table and a vintage built in china cabinet they have books to enjoy and games to play  ok on to the food I fondly remember my first visit I had a really good latte and a blueberry buckle its a nice slice of dense cake  their lattes are always spot on  I have also visited and had an egg and cheese sammie and ohhh boy was it good...ok so here was my dilemma on my recent visit with 2 friends that had not been there before I was going to order a egg and cheese sammie and noticed the roll package from Mancini bread. FYI Mancini is local my issue is they put lard in their bread I am pescatarian ( I eat fish and dairy) lard in bread is not an expected ingredient in bread or rolls (at least not with out warning) yup that egg sammie was indeed good but I wish I had known then about the lard so this last visit I had a great latte and a crisp chocolate cookie they have a sandwich menu and I have had a soup there too  everyone is very friendly and they apologized ...it seems all their breads are from Mancini if that is not an issue for you then you must try their Sammies  I always find parking on the street",

I ordered a portobello sandwich, a special for the day. Hubs got a Troy Hill turkey and we both had ice teas. It came out to under $30.  Now, the food was amazing! My sandwich had a layer of pesto that was next to the cheese making for a very mixture. The roasted peppers were quite in as well. Not realizing how liberal the sandwiches were, the 12 inch turkey is large enough for two people. Hubs wasn't able to finish it, though tried he did. They didn't hold back at all on the turkey or greens. Quite tasty.  The people working here are so friendly! They didn't turn people away and let those who ordered closer to closing stay and eat. It's a kind gesture.   The treats look tasty and I might be back just for those items!",

I grew up just a couple doors away, and we would come here to buy penny candy and occasionally pick up cottage cheese for my mother. It has the same good vibe. When they renovated the restaurant, they retained much of the old architecture and furniture. Nostalgia extraordinaire!  Bobby and \"his people\" are very welcoming and his food is very good and reasonably priced. I value cleanliness, and this restaurant is always neat and clean. I encourage people to try this place. It has great atmosphere to hang and be with friends and have a good bite to eat. I highly recommend Pear and the Pickle :-)",

You order your meal and coffee at the counter and the staff will deliver it to your table.  We all ordered the breakfast sandwich which was a fresh bun, topped with egg, sausage or bacon, and your cheese of choice served on mismatched china.  The cafe isn't very big so you may have to share a table with other guests, which is what we did, but is totally fine in my book.  I will say that our sandwiches took a little while to get because there was only one chef, but he was very nice and apologetic about it.  I would definitely recommend meeting a friend here for brunch, lunch, coffee or all three!  Such a fun little place to catch up with people.",

    "text": "I stopped by here earlier today with my wife for our morning coffee.  While I had wanted to head to the Pear and Pickle for awhile, I hadn't made it.  Thankfully it happened to be on the Pittsburgh Coffee Passport which gave me that little extra nudge that I needed to visit.  The inside of this place is neat as it feels old school.  What I mean by that is that it has the feel of an old general store.  So lots of old darkish wood and then there are still shelves that used to hold the products.  Don't let that fool you into thinking it is cold and uninviting as it is exactly the opposite, warm and friendly.  For coffee on this morning I went with a 12 oz latte while my wife went with the 16 oz cold brew.  We also decided to split a sandwich and so we went with the egg sandwich with 3 pepper cheese and then added some bacon.  Our coffees came out first and whenever I tried my latte I thought that the coffee part was a little bitter.  However it really worked well with the milk which smoothed it out and made it much more pleasant.  My wife's cold brew ended up being quite good as the coffee was rich, strong and smooth.  After we had both tried our coffees the egg sandwich was ready and man did it look good with the cheese visibly melted.  It tasted as good as it looked with the egg being done nicely and the pepper cheese being ooey and gooey with a nice little kick to boot.  I am normally one to complain about buns that aren't completely toasted like this one, but I believe in this instance that it worked well.  It had a somewhat buttery flavor to it and held together to the end even though my wife and I had cut the sandwich to split it.  The bottom line for me is that I would be back again in the future.  My wife and I both really loved the feel of this place and thought that the coffee and food were good too!",

I ordered a cold brew coffee and a breakfast sandwich, both of which were fantastic. I was skeptical at first because the price for a sausage egg and cheese was more pricey than what I'm used to, and the bread used was just a regular hamburger bun.    However, it was really delicious. These people know how to make a good breakfast sandwich. Its definitely not what I was expecting, (two sausage patties and the addition of tomato), but it all worked together nicely and tasted great.  Street parking is also very easy to find, unlike in other parts of the city, which is a nice perk.   I will definitely be back soon!",

Out once more on the quest to find new coffee haunts around the 'Burgh, I made my way up to Troy Hill to check out Pear and the Pickle. I was pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful area with lots of space and tables of all sizes to choose from. I enjoyed a Stumptown (!!) coffee in addition to a breakfast sandwich, which was made to order on a Mancini's bun with crisp bacon, egg, and a generous slice of pepper jack cheese. Service was not the most welcoming to start (hence the 4 stars), but I did receive an apology for the wait on the breakfast sandwich--though I gotta say, it was just about worth it. The market portion is cute and could be handy to pick up any pantry staples you might be short on. This would be a nice spot to meet friends for breakfast or lunch, and I hope to come back soon to do just that.",
