We were waited on by friendly waiter however the order was messed up from beginning to end. Asked for water with lemon, no lemon. Ordered an item with no tomatoes it came with tomatoes. Ordered a salad with extra shredded cheese and extra ranch. Neither of those came on it. I'm very forgiving and understand mistakes happen. But this was not a super busy night the place was not packed just really awful service. We asked to speak to manager, and we did. After kindly explain to him all that we had experience. He was a younger gentleman who seemed not to even care about our complaints. I would not recommend this place as a friendly enjoyable local restaurant. Perhaps it needs new management and a more caring staff",

Another time, there was very little meat on the sandwich and the wings were cold Again, it was taken care of right away. The food is fresh and very tasty.

    "text": "A friend and I stopped in for a late lunch this past Friday... we agreed to split the featured sandwich which was the beef brisket. As is always the case - the presentation was deniably awesome- 2 huge hunks of bread stuffed with meat, fries, cheese & coleslaw - all held together & speared with a steak knife.  I  couldn't wait!   Well after that first bite , everything changed There was no discernible 'beef' taste...it lacked flavor, was lukewarm at best and  the brisket was fatty.  After expressing our disappointment to the server she offered us another sandwich and we chose the pastrami. I did take a little nibble and it seemed to be ok, so I wrapped the rest up to take home.  Later that evening I decided to deconstruct the sandwich -I removed the bread, coleslaw & tomato and put the pastrami & fries in a pan to reheat.  I can't tell you how shocked I was when I took the pastrami off the bread slice ...there was literally nothing there See, when the sandwich was served the pastrami was visible hanging out at the edge, which gave the impression that it was thick and consistent on the entire piece of bread, which, sadly, was not the case. I'm Western Pennsylvania born & raised so I do like my fair share of meat. I was thoroughly disappointedI also found no evidence of cheese on the sandwich unless that little bit of white on the edge of the meat represented some. I decided to chronicle my experience in hopes that Primanti Bros will see it and step up their game.  Thanks for letting me vent. #thisisnotmyoldprimantis",

I've enjoyed all of the other locations more than this one.  To be fair and give the Hampton location a fair try, I've eaten there four times so far.   Each time it has been way too busy (packed with people) and the food takes FOREVER to be served.   At our last visit, we waited over a half hour for our salad, wings, and sandwiches.   The server didn't have the sense to even bring out the salad before the rest of the food.     It's always way too noisy.  They have a windowed enclosure on the one side of the building and it's too cold in the winter.    The food was good there a couple of times and a couple of times the food was crappy.    It's a gamble.",

The suburban locations lose the charm and edge that made Primanti's a Pittsburgh icon, and make just as drastic sacrifices in food.  The expanded menu would best be avoided.  They make one thing well, and that's the standard Primanti's sandwich.  If you're interested in anything else, you're better off eating elsewhere.  Service was slow at the Hampton location, and it felt like they tried to cram too many tables into the space.  The tables were uncomfortably close, and we couldn't so much as adjust our chairs without bumping people at another table.  The sandwiches were alright, but below the quality I'm used to.  It was an alright meal, but I won't go back.  If you want Primanti's, it's worth making the 20 minute drive to one of the original locations.",

    "text": "Primanti Bros is a chain restaurant that is nothing like the original restaurant.  Okay, maybe one or two things are the same.  I'll say those are beers and sandwiches.    If you've never been to one before the sandwich has the sides inside.  No need for a side unless you want to share with others.  My ultimate favorite is the When Pigs Fly.  It has ham, turkey, and bacon on it, plus the other normal toppings.  I'm never disappointed of the tasty goodness this combination provides.    They've got plenty of beer on tap, nothing crazy but you can surely find something tasty to enjoy.  This location has a center island bar with one half (or third) of the restaurant in a garage type room that opens up to the outside.  Although, I've never seen them open it up... even on nice days.  This room is nice but the acoustics can be quite challenging as nothing absorbs the sounds.  This is a good place to go when you're really hungry and craving a sandwich (their pizza isn't too bad either)!",

Now this place looks nice, service was ok but the quality of my steak sandwich was lacking. I came here two weeks after they opened up this location and had a horrible experience so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and figure ill try again some time later . So I went in about a week ago and service wasnt bad. But my steak sandwich was really lacking. It took me 20 mins to get ( I was by myself) then the steak patty was dry and barely warm. Also what happened to having a ton of fries on the sandwich? I literally counted 8 fries? I mean really? The fries are the cheapest product on the sandwich!  Well I guess if i ever get a craving for it again ill make the trip to the strip.",

The food was pretty good, and there are definitely some pros to the suburban restaurants vs the urban locations. Our favorite thing to do is split and share two sandwiches (each get a half of the others.)  1. Knife to cut your own sandwich. This is GREAT! Our kids eat a little over half of their own sandwich and take the rest home. Now we can cut our own size sandwich for the kids without it getting overly messy. (Cut in half, and cut the other half perpendicular, or just cut a 3/4 sandwich.)  2. Bright, open, and clean location.  3. Ragin' Cajun sandwich was most definitely not ragin' at all. I feel it was very under-seasoned, not spicy at all. This is one of our favorite sandwiches and we were surprised how lacking in spiciness it was.  4. Fairly popular for college football games. Random people clapping and cheering at the wide variety of screens available. When we entered it was about 1/3 filled and quiet, but slowly the tables started to fill. The random clapping and hollering startled us the first few times.",

    "text": "I Visited over the summer. Normally I love primantis but my last visit was a disappointment. The restaurant was nearly empty and they chose to seat us in the open enclosure area. I knew i didnt want to sit there, but I held my breath. Normally outdoor seating is acceptable but my goodness this was a disaster. It is feet from a major highway leaving a very windy and loud dining experience. The sandwich was sub-par. Cold meat, fries and minimal coleslaw. Very bland.  I am hoping next time it will be better.",

    "text": "Sandwiches are piled high with grilled meat, melted provolone cheese, coleslaw, fries, and ripe tomatoes on Italian bread. I had the Joe, Dick and Stanley sandwich of capicola, oven-roasted turkey, roast beef and provolone cheese. Wow! Good selection of craft beers too. Service is so-so, but who cares when you get your monster sandwich.",
