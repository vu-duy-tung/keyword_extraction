It very likely could have been the cooking styles that we selected but I felt like there was a bit of an after taste on the steak.  Overall, the cheese, salad and desert courses were amazing.  Matthew was our server and he could not have done a better job. My parents were new to The Melting Pot so he did a very good job of explaining the overall process. He continually checked on us and made sure the courses were served at an appropriate pace. I can be fairly critical of service and I thought he did an exceptional job.",

    "text": "Came here with a small group this past weekend to celebrate my cousin's birthday. It was my first time at the Melting Pot or any type of fondue place, and honestly, it was a little overwhelming. Understanding the different menus and options, what things you pick to dip, what things you pick to dip in, what goes with what... Our waitress was definitely willing to answer any of our questions though.  For cheese we had the Spinach Artichoke and Wisconsin Trio, which were both pretty good. We got the Bouillon and Mojo for cooking our entrees, and I got the Shrimp and Sirloin to go with it. Honestly, the time spent deliberating over which cooking styles to go with wasn't worth it, because I don't think the flavors were strong enough (or at least don't seep into your food enough for sitting in it a couple minutes) to really make a big difference. Perhaps I'm a little impatient, but it would be nice to maybe have some more than 2 fondue utensils, so I can cook more than a couple slivers of meat at once.  For dessert we got Pure milk chocolate and I believe the Flaming Turtle (whatever the second one was, I didn't have any because it had nuts). All of the desserts to dip in the chocolate were delicious!  Overall, everything was pretty good. My cousin loved the experience and so it was a great night, but I don't think I would personally ever pick it for myself. I can't really justify the price for what you're getting, and I prefer food I don't have to cook myself, 1 piece at a time =)",

Also, the sharing that is involved with fondue seems romantic to me.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Classic Alpine cheese fondue for our first course and it was fantastic!  We then ordered the Coq Au Vin fondue for our 2nd course, which was delicious and went really well with the sirloin and filet in particular.  We ended our meal with a chocolate fondue for dessert and we loved everything about it!  What makes the Melting Pot only 4 stars for me despite how pleased I was with the food was that the service was a little slow (still very polite and knowledgeable of the menu though) and they gave us a table that was kind of in the way for waiters and waitresses so it felt like people were constantly bustling past us.",

The food wasn't insanely unique, in and of itself, but the experience of cooking your food for yourself over the pots and the fondue and desert creations were cool.  We went there with a large group of friends and had a private room. Our menu and our mutual criticisms:  There are 4 courses to the meals. A Cheese Fondue appetizer that is served with raw veggies and different breads for dipping. A \"salad\" (we chose the lettuce wraps which were really tastey with a really great sauce). The entree of the meats that you choose and cooking broth that you choose to cook them in.  You spear a piece of meat on your fondue fork and let it simmer in the boiling broth and they tell you about how long to submerge/cook each type of meat. Your desert (several different types of chocolate fondue to choose from) and this is served with Marshmallows, Rice Crispy Treats, Cheesecake, brownies and strawberries.  \"Big Night Out\" Option 2 of \"Fondue Fusion\" Spinach/Artichoke Fondue = AWESOME, best fondue on the table! Lobster, Steak, Pork, Ahi Tuna, Chicken, Shrimp & Veggie Wontons = Awesome! Mojo Style cooking sauce = good (we'd try something different next time) Dessert Fondue (we chose the crunchy peanut butter chocolate) and it was amazing!!!  Cool for a large group or a romantic night out.  Dress Code:  The girls were dressed cute, but really.... you could have worn a tank top and jeans and been just fine!  Just don't wear something scrubby!",

You start off with cheese fondue as like an appetizer and then for your meal you cook your own meat right in front of you in a hot seasoning(you could pick the flavors you wanted.) They give you colored cooking sticks so you can keep track of who's meat is who's. Then I the best part of the night was the dessert fondue. You picked what kind of dipping sauce you wanted and you got fruit, cake, etc. to dip into it. In general I wasn't a fan of the whole experience! I'd only go back just for dessert not to actually eat a meal there.",

It cost 3 of us $240 plus, for a chef to never even touch my food.....DAMN.  I am no cheap skate when it comes to food, I LOVE spending money on food. But I feel it is a little ridiculous to pay $43 a person to cook your own food, when you know, your total meal cost rough $11.   It was fun, It was. But I might have goofed going to \"4 course meal\". I mean you only really want the cheese & chocolate, let's be real. The main courses i feel are garbage.  Everyone said you'll love it, go there, it's so cool. I cook for living, not fun, nor cool.  If you have to go to \"The Melting Pot\", just get cheese or chocolate.......I'm done.

Great place for a romantic evening or a fun party out.  Service: From the bar manger Hank to the hostess and our fabulous server - honestly - they could not have done a better job.  Our server was knowledgeable  - pleasant and attentive. You could tell she came to her restaurant on her off time.  She was insightful and helpful.  She was there when you wanted her to be but was in no way overbearing.  She was an absolute delight.  Food: Very fresh and plenty of it.  We chose the Big Night Out.  Picked what worked out for us - were able to substitute anything we did not like. Great selection - fresh and plentiful.  Everything you could want.  Wine:  As it was a special occasion  - I brought my own bottle. Corkage fee was more than reasonable.  Being the curious type I also read the wine list.  The list was complete and well balanced.  Anybody - novice to expert - on a budget or not - could absolutely find a great bottle of wine.  This is a great list and one I will be ordering from in the future.  Allergy:  My girlfriend has a severe life threatening nut allergy.  When our server came to the table she was already aware of it.  She explained all the food options and what needed to be avoided.  She also stressed any actions she took to assure there was no nut contact.  I have witnessed many restaurants deal with this allergy and they were by the far the best.  I rarely if ever post these types of reviews - but our experience was so good I felt guilty not sharing our excellent experience.  Stop by - you will be amazed.",

We enjoyed the taste of all of the food, and our stomachs felt full after the meal was over. You keep track of whose food is whose by inserting colored sticks into the cooking pot on your table. I recommend coming to this restaurant with people with whom you do not mind sharing germs, because you will be sharing the same cooking pot. The waitress and other wait staff stopped by frequently to bring us the next course and to refill our beverages. The total price for two people was about $100, not including the tip. I will not return to this restaurant frequently, but it provides a different, fun experience to do occasionally. The dress code is casual, although you may dress up if you want to do so.",

Bread, soft pretzels, apples, carrots, celery, and broccoli were plentiful for dipping dunking submerging into gooey cheese. The iceberg salad ... ugh ... spring greens would have made this a 5 star review.  My date and I typically don't share meals ... carnivore v. will try anything.  We chose a citrus broth to cook our food.  He had filet, jerk beef, and pork.  I had the shrimp, tuna, and salmon.   We cooked the potatoes, mushrooms, and broccoli in the broth.   Beware the potatoes take a long time to cook and are really hot.   We finished our meal with the smores fondue.  Marshmallows, rice krispie treats, brownies, strawberries, and bananas were our dipping options ... the fondue was crumbled graham crackers, milk chocolate, and marshmallow... very good.

Dark like... covert meeting dark. Dark like... you'll definitely forget your phone dark.   But we're in it to win it.  And melty cheese is a huge draw.  We all got salads and a cheese pot to share, with the addition of a meat tray.   The salads were good, like you'd make at home.   The melty cheese was good, too...  like you'd make at home!!!  So this is where the issue is:  for quite a premium price I want something that takes me some time to figure out how I could possibly make it at home,  not something that I am pretty sure I could improve on at home.

We arrived right at opening, 4 pm, and for about 30 minutes we were the only ones there. We had our own private dining experience for a brief time! Our waiter, whose name escapes me, was fabulous. He really was terrific, super friendly and helpful with the menu. We started off with salads and then the main course items showed up. Wow, we were pleasantly surprised with the amount that came. At least 6 pieces each of sirloin, filet, chicken, pork and shrimp as well as ravioli. It also came with 6 different dipping sauces. Teriyaki, sweet and sour and green goddess were our favs. For dessert with went with the milk chocolate, which came with pound cake, blondies, strawberries, bananas, pineapple and rice krispy treats for dipping. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience. There is a Station Square paid parking lot less than a block away for your convenience. However, they do not validate parking.",

They have the option of 4 course dinner, and you get to choose the cheese of your preference for the fondue, the meats you want and the style you want them cook, salad plus a desert. The prices are a bit elevated. However, it is more a restaurant to have a nice experience, chat with some friends/family, and to have fun, rather than just going for dinner.  I ordered the 4 course dinner to share with my son. But you can build your own or get just an entree.  It is enough food for both, unless you are a foodie intense. Otherwise, one meal (4 course) feed you both.",

I came with a friend for dessert, and the thing that confused me the most was the fact that they couldn't switch us to a table with 2 of the pot burner things. The restaurant was 3/4 empty so I don't see why they had to force us to share just one. This meant that we could only try one type of fondue at a time. Either way, we decided on the Yin and Yang chocolate fondue which was half white chocolate and half milk chocolate. Sadly, the 2-person portion of fruits and cake that came with it was barely enough for 1 person. It also took them almost 35 minutes to put together that SMALL plate. There was obviously no cooking involved since its just fruits and cake and the restaurant was almost empty so I really don't know what took them so long.   Sure, the chocolate was good and my Instagram account was happy -- everything looked appetizing and tasted good but the whole experience wasn't worth the time and money.",

Our waiter (I think his name was Eric) was wonderful and personable.  When I called in our reservation they asked if it was a special occasion, and for a small fee had balloons waiting on the table for her with a box of chocolate, she was so tickled.  Food was excellent and generous, service was beyond reproach.  The booth behind us had a different server and even he stepped over to check on us and I heard our waiter checking on them as well.  That's real teamwork there.  The manager made his rounds also, wished her well, as did other servers.  Well done, Melting Pot.  Thank you for showing my daughter what class and professionalism is on her special night.",

You couldn't even taste the alcohol... it was sweet but not overbearing and one was more than plenty.  Let's get to the actual fondue part now, for the cheese part we got the Quattro formaggio. It was really good, the texture is surprising because its quite thick but almost taking on a solid form. I suppose it's the corn starch? Anyways it was delicious . Next we got the house salads with the house dressing. It was a decent salad in every sense of the word.  Now it's time for the entrees, My Grandmother and I got the \"Pittsburgh big night out.\" It had everything.. Lobster, shrimp, chicken, pork, steak, and wild mushroom sachette. For the broth we got the coq au vin it was lovely. The shrimp was especially tasty. The portions you get look smaller than they actually are. It hit the spot for sure.  Last but not least, dessert! We got the banana foster fondue. I don't particularly care for banana however that was the bomb. The Oreo covered marshmallows paired really well with the bananas foster. They even lit candles for my grandmas birthday.  All in all everything was great. The server was really friendly and personable too which helped a lot seeing we're not from the area.   (If you get the chance to go here, go! It's pricey but worth every penny)",

The jerk seasoned sirloin was really good that was my first time trying it. The pretzel bread was new to me too and I absolutely loved it. The portions always surprise me but in essence you nibble until you're full. Get on the email list to learn about specials because it is pricey but well worth it. Perfect for date nite, girls night or special occasions. This is the only location in Pittsburgh. Parking is not an issue since there are 2 parking lot options. The restaurant is always immaculate and the staff is very friendly. You can maked reservations online which I absolutely love. This ia certainly one of my favorites.",

My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary dinner and we were guided to a back area of the restaurant that was intimate and perfect for the occasion. It was a small two person table with only one other couple in sight. The food was fantastic, and you could tell it was fresh and good quality. The best part is when they prepare the cheese course right in front of you. However, my one complaint is that they are not very accommodating with food restrictions. I do not eat red meat and was hoping to have my red meat subbed out for something else. But I was told that the portions are pre-determined so they could not switch out the red meat without getting rid of it completely. My boyfriend still eats red meat so we opted to keep it and I ate what I could from the plate. It wasn't a huge deal but definitely a disappointment. Overall though, great food, great service, and a very full belly.",

In general, I kinda hated how the restaurant is structured. There's a vegetarian option, but it won't work if you are the only vegetarian in a small (or large) group of meat eaters. Everybody has to share. Also, the meat comes out completely raw and you have to cook it in a pot of broth. I thought that was kinda gross! The cheese was really good though! I had spinach and artichoke cheese. I really liked it. The stuff they served it with.. not so much. A tiiiiny portion of cold, raw vegetables and super hard pretzel bread pieces. They will give you more of both if you ask, but they kind of hope you don't ask. Also, unless you just decide to get cheese ($10), each dinner is about $40-50 per person. Food was pretty good, but just too weird to ever try again. Too bad, because I love fondue!",

I tend to go on \"Ladies Night Out\" because it's a great deal for the experience. You get a salad choice, cheese and chocolate. The portions are tiny but they will refill some of your dippers free of charge if you didn't quite get enough of something. I always think this isn't going to be enough and by the time I leave I can barely move. Because there are several courses it is much more filling than it appears. I have yet to come across a fondue flavor that I haven't liked yet, although I have not tried them all.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying that the servers and staff at the Melting Pot were very nice and helpful. Aside from that, I have to say - no, to declare emphatically! -- people of Pittsburgh, particularly for the money, you can eat much, much (much!!) better at many other places in the city.   I won't go into the circumstances that brought us to the Melting Pot, but while my expectations were low to begin with, I could not have imagined how pathetic the actual dining experience could be.  A few measly pieces of dry bread, slices of Granny Smith apple, a few bits of cut up celery and baby carrots (yes, baby carrots, like the ones you buy in a bag for $1.99 at Giant Eagle)? Really?! This is what you serve somebody for a $13 starter? And, as we were told, we really needed two to have enough to serve as an actual appetizer. I know the thrill of dipping these subpar ingredients in melted cheese is the calling card of the Melting Pot experience, but personally I'd be embarrassed to put this in front of a paying customer. I certainly wouldn't serve it to a guest in my home.   Perhaps the protein plates are better, but based on the quantities alone that I saw, there is no way you could justify the cost. You want a delicious steak or seafood dish for the same price? Go to Whitfield in East Liberty (and it's easier to get into and has awesome cocktails) or Cafe Du Jour on the Southside. Want some melt in your mouth beef on delicious bread, for about 1/3 of the price, go to Gaucho in the Strip. Want some really good bread with cheese, go to Mercurio's or Dinette or Driftwood Oven and get some amazing pizza. Want just about anything you could be in the mood for? Go to Smallman or Federal Galley and choose from 4 restaurants!  I could go on, and list restaurant after restaurant where there are skilled chefs who actually cook for you, using quality ingredients, and where you can get a real dining experience.   The Melting Pot - simply put -- is a scam. It's nothing more than sad little plates of subpar ingredients dressed up in a pretty restaurant interior. So skip the \"experience\" of bowls of melted cheese and go discover Pittsburgh's many excellent restaurants. It will be worth it and you may even save a few bucks while you're at it.",

Don't get me wrong.. it's nice.. just not 'Ahhhmaazing'. The fondues are good. We tried a couple. I found the \"make-it-in-front-of-u\" aspect a bit gimmicky and I can't help but feel that anyone can make this at home with grocery store bought cheese for a lot lesser money. Service was ok. The cocktails were a bit syrupy and sweet for my taste.. not fresh and original. In general, a decent restaurant but at that price point, I'm left wanting of a more memorable experience.",

We picked the 4 course meal because it's worth it. We shared the fiesta cheese. Not super spicy but if you don't like spicy don't get it. I had the strawberry salad and it was a perfect mix of salad and dressing. I picked my own meats. I had shrimp, tuna, steak, and lobster. We of course had dessert and we picked the original and it had milk chocolate with peanut butter and it was to die for.  The actual best part of our meal was our server , Nick. We were not expecting Nick to be so wonderful. He was nice, he explained the menu so well and he gave us complimentary champagne, like how awesome is that. We will continue to request him when we come back. He is the Beyonce to our Jay-z and Blue Ivy. I hope he gets to read this !",

We were able to pick from three different kinds of cheese options. The waiter mixed all the ingredients in front of us while explaining each one and giving pointers on how to eat fondue since we had never before. Delicious!!!!  Next we're salads,.....nothing too out of the ordinary there, but good.  Next was a plate of raw proteins. Shrimp, marinated pork, three different kinds of beef and four mushroom filled pastas. Again, we were given directions for about how long it takes to cook each. It was all amazing! Just cook to your liking. I tended to cut everything in half to make sure it was cooked all the way through. A bowl of some veggies were also available. Several dipping sauces were provided. So good. So filling.  Lastly was desert. We chose the French Toast white chocolate and had all kinds of sweets like marshmallows, cake squares, banana and strawberries.  It's a fun experience and the food was great. Nice atmosphere. Pretty pricey, so I will reserve going back for special occasions, but we will most likely be back someday.",

The hosts were extremely friendly and accommodating with our umbrellas (as it had been raining outside). We were immediately shown to our table which was a cute little corner table perfect for our date night! Our server Jessie was so friendly and personable and had great suggestions as it was our first time there. We dine out pretty often and he provided some of the best service we've had in Pittsburgh in a while. We opted for the four course experience (cheese fondue, salad, entree & chocolate fondue) which was so worth the price. I can't recommend this place enough and will definitely be back for another special occasion!",

We had always had a good experience in the past but will probably skip in the future. The new location seats everyone too close. We were sat sharing a booth with another group, only separated by a glass divider on the table. They were drinking and using explicit language, while we were there with elementary aged kids trying to celebrate a birthday. It also took 20 minutes, and me going up to the hostess asking for someone to take our drink order. They asked if we were celebrating anything, and I said yes it was my birthday. I had even noted that in our reservation. The waiter mentioned he would bring out a cake, but never did and didn't even seem to remember. This upset me, but mostly my kids. It was supposed to be a fun and special outing but I ended up annoyed and uncomfortable for much of it. The food was fine, but the cheese fondue wasn't as good as we remembered. We can honestly make it better ourselves with higher quality ingredients. For almost $200, we are paying for the experience and when that is off it's definitely not worth the price.",

I seem to always forget that the portions here are huge and I should never do the 4 courses. I could barely walk after the four courses. If anything, I should've skipped the salad for sure.

We had a tiny cast iron skillet on a electric burner that didn't really get hot enough to cook the meat. That's what took so long cooking all the chunks of raw meat on a barely hot tiny skillet. The cheese fondue came with random things to dip like big chunks of stale bread, baby carrots and celery. Who wants baby carrots with cheese? They took the cheese before we got our meat so we couldn't dip our chicken in cheese. It def needed it, it was bland. All the meat was less than quality. Over $100 to cook your own mediocre food. I was fine with the price when I thought I was going to a nice dinner. But this place is just a rip off that's making a killing. They don't even need a chef. All they do is cut up the meat in chunks that are still too large. The chocolate came with pre made snacks like rice crispys treats and marshmallows to dip so it was just so so, nothing special. Nothing here was worth $100 plus.",

    "text": "I went here with my wife and another couple on a Friday night.  We had reservations for 7 and upon arrival were seated fairly quickly to our table.  The chairs sit lower/table is a little higher since your experience here is cooking your own food.  We used a coupon for a 3 course meal and ordered dessert as a 4th course (which was by far the best course).  For starters, we had two types of cheese heated in front of us with bread, chips, apples, and vegetables for dipping. The cheeses are made right in front of your eyes, and I thoroughly enjoyed the one cheese which was a Mexican Salsa and Jalapeno combination. The vegetables and bread were great dipping selections.  The second course was a salad, and my wife and shared ours with each other.  I ordered the Caesar and my wife had a strawberry spinach.  The salads were fairly small and light, which was good since doing a 4 course meal will fill you up.  For the main course, we had some butternut squash ravioli, Cajun chicken, Teriyaki beef, and filet mignon with a side of vegetables. The food comes out raw and part of the experience here is that you cook the food yourself in a bowl of your selection.  We had an oil based and a water based mix to cook our food in.  Definitely recommend placing your vegetables in first to allow it to soak up some of the flavors of your cooking base.  The food cooked pretty nicely and was easy to do.  Our favorite part by far was the dessert.  We had a turtle chocolate dip and a milk chocolate dip.  They brought out a plate that had strawberries, cookies, angel food cake, bananas, and graham cracker coated marshmallows. Dipping these in fresh warm chocolate was amazing!  Would highly recommend saving room for dessert when you go.  The Melting Pot provides a very unique dining experience. If the price scares you away, I would recommend coming here just to try out the dessert.  They have some pretty good food and it was a fun experience to cook our own food.  Don't expect to be done with dinner quickly here! Great place to make it a night out with friends!",

He answered all of our questions and helped us to enjoy our visit. We wanted the full experience so we all went with the four course. There were two pots on our table (four people) so we made two cheese selections. The spinach and artichoke was excellent. The fiesta was good but its more of a chip dipper. Go for the gooey cheeses. The apple was surprisingly delicious covered in cheese. You also get different breads and veggies. The second course was salad. Two of us had the caesar. It was very good. The third course is your entree. The other three chose the classic. There was a lot of meat on that plate. They all seemed to enjoy the flavors. I did the choose three option with potstickers, shrimp and salmon. Our choices for broth was the mojo and the coq au vin. The mojo was our favorite of the two. The dipping sauces were a nice addition to the already flavorful protein. And last but not least, the chocolate. We chose the turtle and the original. This was heavenly!! I personally loved the waffles and marshmallow. We all agreed that while it was fun to do the four course, our next visit will be right down to business with just cheeses and chocolates. They are really the stars! Overall the experience was very satisfying and i highly recommend giving it a try!",

They have recently moved to a new location and it's pretty bad when my wife (who has loved this place) says \"guess we need to find a new place\". The intimate atmosphere is gone and is way more open. It's not horrible but the seat we had was. We were stuck on the upper floor In the back next to an ugly coat rack and had to deal with the staff acting like fools in the corner since I guess it was by a kitchen area.  To make things worse the waitress and service were horrible! To name a few things: she did not talk or even check on us, the salad was wilted, and now they bring the cheese out instead of mixing in front of you. She did not even explain that it would be cold initially. The soda initially had no carbonation and when we asked for another she was told it would be a while to get it fixed. An hour into being there  we finally got the soda and also our alcoholic drinks which took forever. The entree and the dessert were fine but again not even a word or explanation from the waitress. Just dropped it off and walked away. This is definitely not the service we have had in the past! We were completely disgusted the entire time and my wife would not let me say anything because she was afraid they would do something to our food. If it wasn't on the later side on a Saturday we would have walked out. When you are already paying a lot to cook your own food it's upsetting when you get treated like this. We were waiting for a manager to round like they typically do but this didn't happen either and when we walked out the 5 people at the front desk did not say a word. Can't believe this place has come to this and will probably not return. We work in customer service occupations and I would be completely embarrassed if my customers felt like this. Good Luck with your new service and location!!!#GOSOMEWHEREELSE #LETSOMEONEELSECOOK",

The melting pot is a nice date night place to go. The atmosphere at first glance doesn't seem like anything special nor do I think they want to make it seem over the top fancy. However, once they seat you,  it feels like you are in your own little world. The lights are dim and the music is soft. It just felt romantic but then again, doesn't dipping strawberries and cheese cake, etc in smooth melted chocolate sound amazing? We had the chocolate s'more fondue but it's all about what sounds good to you! Oh, and the martinis are rich and decedent!",

    "text": "I've been to the Melting Pot multiple times over the last few years, and I've never been disappointed. However, I was slightly disappointed last night because I had made reservations, but they gave our table away because my friend was stuck in traffic and was 10 minutes late. They refused to seat me until my friend arrived, so we had to wait an additional 10 minutes after her arrival to be seated. Why bother making a reservation?  But this is a trivial matter compared to the overall experience. I usually don't order an entree unless I'm bringing someone who's never been there before. I'm more than happy with just cheese, chocolate, and drinks (and this cuts the cost down considerably). But we decided to go all out and order all 3 courses. We started with the Fiesta cheese, which is my favorite. There is salsa in the cheese, and jalapenos are added to your liking. Dippers include bread, tortilla chips, apples, broccoli, and carrots. Next, we both ordered the individial filet mignon meal. We chose Coq au Vin for the cooking style, which has a red wine base. I was a little worried that it would have too much of a wine taste, but it didn't at all. It also comes with mushrooms and some other things for flavoring (celery, I'm guessing). Entrees also come with potatoes (put them in early - they take forever to cook), broccoli, and more mushrooms. The filet meal also comes with 5 dipping sauces. My favorite is the spinach dip-like sauce, and the teriyaki is good as well. We went with the Flaming Turtle for dessert. Ours didn't seem to have any caramel in it, but it was delicious nonetheless. Dippers included Rice Krispie Treats (my favorite), brownie bites, blondie bites, marshmallows, angel food cake, pineapple, strawberries, and bananas. All of it was delicious and we left feeling like we'd never eat again.  Service is always excellent at the Melting Pot. Our server, Dalles, was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. It was a busy Saturday night and she stayed on top of things.  I noticed that some reviewers don't like the location of the restaurant. I guess it is a little odd, being located inside Station Square mall. But I've never even noticed that there aren't any windows, and I've always just considered the dim lighting part of the ambiance.  The cost is rather high (our bill was over $100 for two people), but the Melting Pot offers specials such as Ladies' Night, 80s Night (with 80s prices), and Late Night Fondue after 9pm. They send out an email about once a month to let you know what's happening that month.  Overall, it was another great experience, and I'll be back many times to come!",

Heck, if memory serves me correctly, The Melting Pot used to be in a different location at the complex.  But for all the times I'd passed it, I'd never eaten here until this past weekend.  Rick and I came here with his colleague and her husband.  Well we started off with the Wisconsin Trio of cheeses for our fondue course. The fondue is the restaurant's raison d'etre (it is The Melting Pot after all).  M-M-M, what a great way to start a meal!  Now for our main courses we could have gone with the Fondue By You or the Four Course Experience.  But we decided to go with individual dinners instead.  I went for the Atlantic Salmon and Rick went for the sirloin.  I don't remember what our friends had, but we all agreed our dinners were done to perfection.  And of course nothing tops off dinner at The Melting Pot better than a dessert if chocolate fondue.  Remember folks, there's always room for dessert!  We tried their signature Flaming Turtle--milk chocolate, caramel and candied pecans flambeed tableside!  Whoo-hoo, give me a couple of extra units of insulin!",

It is a very relaxing atmosphere, our waitress, Blair was absolutely amazing and made the entire meal so much more enjoyable. If you are going expecting \"wow\" food you are missing the point of this restaurant, it is the experience. The process of cooking your own food, quality conversation, and wait staff that knows how to treat people like they are friends make for a completely enjoyable time. Very much worth the time",

Oh and $15 of your 25 goes to a breast cancer research foundation.  Although, our server was nice,I think he was having an off night, but then again I did hear a bunch of cackling women, so I guess I understand.  We did call him out on chewing gum like a horse while preparing our cheese fondue, but we didn't dock him points for that.   So the cons for the evening, drinks took a long time, our server almost made the wrong cheese, and one of the drinks was in a considerably smaller glass than the other, see photo.  Overall it was a fun night, the cheese and chocolate were good, and it was a good cause.    If you're a fan of the MP, join their mailing list, they're always having fun events.",

    "text": "If I could pour the whole pot of fondue into my mouth I would. Fo real.   In theory it sounds good. In real life I'll just drown any morsel of food I can into the chocolate and stuff it in!   This is a special occasion restaurant. A special occasion where I have enough money to spare, because dear lord, it's pricey!   The two greatest tips that they don't advertise:   *Half off on Sundays from noon-3 PM. REMEMBER TO MENTION THIS TO YOUR SERVER! I learned that fact today when I got the shock of a full priced bill. I assumed they just took the discount off automatically, but apparently you have to tell your server as soon as you sit down that you want the half price meal.   All Big Night Out meals half price = awesome deal!   *Every day after 9 PM you can get cheese and chocolate fondue and a bottle of wine for $35. Serves two.   The Big Night Out consists of your choice of cheese fondue (lots o' different choices of cheeses), salads (get the mushroom one), main dish (usually includes seafood and/or meat), veggies, potatoes and ravioli) and chocolate fondue (mmmmmm!!).   You pick the type of broth for your main course. Usually there's one that complements meat and one for seafood. You're also able to mix and match your chocolate ingredients or choose one from the menu. I lurrrve the S'More's chocolate, it includes choco, marshmallow and graham cracker bits. And, ohhhhhh, the things you dip in the chocolate. Cheesecake, brownies, pound cake, rice crispies, marshmallows, banana's and strawberries. Seriously orgasmic!!   They usually switch up the menu often so you can come once every couple of months and find something new. I also love the atmosphere. It's a great date night place or good for a group outing. The nice thing is that if you go with a group, you can choose a bunch of different cheeses, broths and chocolate to sneak a taste of all of them.   Good thing for me that it is pricey. IF it was cheap, I don't think I'd like what the scale had to say after monthly visits to this place!",

Was highly satisfied with the entree choice. The \"three rivers feast entree came with: teriyaki steak, filet mignon, chicken breast, 4 shrimp, bbq seasoned pork, and pot stickers. We also added a lobster tail.    Started with the fiesta cheese fondue which was excellent. Beer base, cheddar cheese and salsa. The waitress allowed us to choose how spicy we wanted the cheese by adding fresh jalapenos which was nice. We went for hot which was perfect level of spicy. This was served with a white bread, pumpernickel, tortilla chips, baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, and Granny Smith Apples (not a good combo personally).   Caesar salad was next. Pretty standard. Small but that was ok because I didn't want to get too full.  Next was the entree. The meats were served with mushrooms, redskin potatoes and broccoli. We cooked it Coq Au Vin style  (burgundy wine infused with fresh herbs, spices and mushrooms.) The pork was my favorite and hers was the seafood. It was also served with 6 small dipping sauces (+1 for lobster) which paired greatly with all the meats and vegetables.   Lastly, grand finale! White chocolate Creme brulee. Went all out and got the additional dippers. Fresh strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, bananas, chocolate chip cookie, brownie, pound cake, gram cracker coated marshmallows, Oreo coated marshmallows, slice of cheesecake, cream puffs, Rice Krispie treats, and some rolled cookie.   Staff was great. They clear your table fast so no dirty plates sit around. If you ever need more specific dippers they'll bring them for you. Very accommodating. Didn't like the first beer I got so the waitress didn't charge me for it and got me a different one even though I didn't care. Overall if you're willing to spend some cash but for great quality and quantity, this is the place to go.",

    "text": "Had a great visit here during restaurant week and the credit goes almost exclusively to the wonderful service we received from the front desk to table-side where Haley & her crew took great care of us.  The restaurant week menu was really good and provided an excellent sampler of all the yummy food and cooking styles that are available there. We thought that the pre-selected entree choices provided a lot of flavor and variety. The salads were fresh and well prepared - make sure to get some fresh black pepper on it to really kick it up a notch!  A lot of previous comments addressed the new space and the different ambiance. While it is different, I still found it to be very comfortable and much better than expected based on the negativity I read. They have lots of different spaces and what appears to be an effort to build-in a lot of versatility in how they seat groups of different sizes. If you want a more cozier or intimate seating arrangement just ask and perhaps they can find something for you. We sat upstairs and enjoyed the location.  Bar: the TMP G&T was very good although the basil had seen better days. The bar tender should have not included the basil in that condition.  Tip: don't wear clothes that you don't want to launder immediately. All the cooking going on produces aromas that really permeate clothing - you will be enjoying the smell for days unless you wash the clothes you wore.  We'll definitely be back - especially if we can sit in Haley M's section - she really made our experience so good. She was knowledgeable, a great communicator and seemed genuinely happy to be there, which is a rarity these days.",

When we arrived they did not seat us at the time of the reservation and then proceeded to seat 12 people at three separate tables.  This was quite disappointing considering we had a reservation. When I requested a table together, they stated we were informed of the possibility of being separated at the time of booking the reservation. This was not True.   The waitresses were kind, but overall bad experience. The environment was loud and honestly over priced for sub par/prepare your own dinner. Do not recommend.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my experience! I do consider this the type of place that's more for special occasions though than a place to go for just any meal because to do the whole meal does take a lot of time and it's expensive. But I highly recommend it!  For first course we did the Quattro Formaggio cheese fondue. It was just okay, nothing special. I felt like one portion split between two people would be more than enough for an appetizer. I did like that they gave a good variety of things to dip (bread, apples, carrots, celery).  Second course was a salad. I had the Strawberry Pecan salad and it was a great choise! If you like fresh fruit on your salads, you'll enjoy this. The strawberries were nice and fresh, the candied pecans were a good sweet touch, and the vinaigrette was a good complement to everything on the salad. Highly recommend.  For our main entree we tried the Coq au Vin cooking style. The main entree overall was good. I enjoyed cooking everything in the boiling broth, it was a fun and unique experience. The only thing I didn't like was that it was kind of difficult to remember the cooking times for everything, it might be good to put them all on a card to give to tables. None of the meat turned out bad, but we were guessing on the times, it would have been nice to have a reference card. The meat was all delicious, and we also had goat cheese/vegetable ravioli's which I really enjoyed, they had great flavor. I have mixed feelings about getting a cooking style other than the base vegetable broth. I didn't feel like you could taste the flavor of the broth that much unless you let the food sit in the broth for a long time. When I could taste it, it was very good. I could taste it mostly in the vegetables but not the meat. There were also sauces to dip the meat in, so it seems pointless to get flavor from the broth just to cover it up with sauce. None of the sauces stood out to me as that good. I tried them all but didn't really use them for dipping.   Our last course was the Cookie's n' Cream Marshmallow Dream chocolate fondue, it was awesome! I would come back just to try some of the other chocolate fondue's. I love marshmallow so I felt like it was a good mix in with the dark chocolate, the oreo pieces got soft quickly so they didn't add the crunch we had hoped but were still good. We absolutely loved the chocolate. Everything offered to dip into it was delicious, my favorites were the fruit (strawberries and pineapple), the rice krispies, and the waffles which had a great unexpected crunch.   In total our 4 course took about 2.5 hours. The chocolate course was so good I would definitely come back with friends on a random night just to enjoy the dessert. I do think it's a great experience and worth it.",

The entree I got which had Cajun shrimp and chicken was yummy as well, but was definitely the most filling. We ended the night with the s'mores chocolate and that was to die for, yumm!! Our server was awesome and super friendly. Staff was helpful all night long and even brought out my mom candles to blow out with dessert. We had a wonderful experience and would definitely be back again :)",

First of all, it's lost the intimate feel. It used to feel so cozy and romantic, now Its so open and bright and loud. Initially they wanted to sit us at a booth with another couple and the only thing separating us was a small piece of plexiglass...no privacy at all. We finally moved to another table, only to be served by one of the rudest waitresses I've ever come across. She had an attitude from the door because my husband asked if we could still be served by our previous waitress. I had a feeling the night wasn't going to go well, which sucked because it was my birthday. I decided to just order salad and two different cheese fondues, because why would I spend a ton of money just to be annoyed. She had the nerve to ask if that was all we were ordering. Then came back with the smallest amount of cheese I've ever seen...talking about it's a single serving. I don't know if she was just being ignorant or if this is something new the melting pot is doing, but either way I don't like it. When I came in the past, you would order the cheese fondue and get a whole pot. Then when we asked for more of the food to dip in the cheese, she seemed to have a problem with that as well. Probably wondered how we stretched that tiny bit of cheese she gave us. Needless to say, I WILL NOT BE BACK TO THE MELTING POT!!! Such a shame as this was one of my favorite places to go for my birthday or for dinners with my girlfriends. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money!!",

    "text": "I had heard mixed reviews but I enjoyed it. It reminds me of hotpot in China, but just a little more expensive. It's a very social experience, so definitely go with people you wouldn't mind sharing with.   The restaurant is steamy due to all the fondue pots, be prepared for foggy glasses initially. The lighting is dim and perfect for a romantic night out. The hot plates are built into the table and your server will explain what you can and cannot touch.   My friend and I came for a special they were having called $30 on the 30th. We needed a reservation. It was a 4-course meal.   We started with the fiesta cheese fondue. It was beer, cheddar cheese, and salsa. We received pieces of bread, soft pretzel, nacho chips, green apples, celery, and broccoli to dip.   Next we got a strawberry pecan salad. This was one of the best salads I've had in awhile. It has a strawberry vinegarette, with strawberries, candied pecans, I believe blue cheese, and all over mixed green lettuce. I don't even like pecans, but they were so good. They provided a great crunch and flavor profile.   For the third course we had our meet entree. We chose the seasoned court bouillon and received pieces of brasa seasoned chicken, teriyaki sirloin, Pacific white shrimp, filet mignon, and a mix of red potatoes, broccoli, and mushrooms. We put the veggies in first because they would take the longest and then the meats ranged in cook time from 1 to 3 minutes in the broth. The broth was light and didn't overpower the meat flavors. We also got six dipping sauces.   For the dessert course, we chose the Smores fondue. It of course had chocolate and melted marshmallow but then topped with a shot of 151 and then lit on fire to burn off the alcohol. There were also gram cracker pieces. For dipping, we got blondes, brownies, pound cake, gram crackers, and marshmallows covered in cookie pieces. It was a perfect way to finish off the meal. The brownies were my favorite. They were dense and moist. Delicious!  My server gave great service. She was attentive and personal. She explained each course very well and constantly refilled our drinks. Despite having a late reservation and basically closing the place down, she didn't make us feel rushed. Her name escapes me but I'll update the review once I find my receipt.   All in all, the $30 was well worth it. I left feeling stuffed. My friend and I had a great time. I was skeptical about paying a lot of fondue but it was worth it. Checkout their website because they seem to have deals regularly, including a late night special that starts and 9 pm.",

The restaurant did relatively well with our two big tables, and we definitely recommend ordering ahead of time (it's faster, and there's a 10% discount!). My hat is off to the sous chefs for chopping and plating so many different dishes. The lot of us shared several four-course meals, each with our own entree. No one left hungry; I think even our shadows were full! Given the price and time it takes, definitely for special occasions only. But it's very conducive to conversation while dipping and cooking. If I went back, it would be for a smaller meal, or maybe just dessert. (I sooo wanted to lick the spoon that had been in the dark chocolate fondue, but I had just met most of the people at the table and didn't want to be remembered as THAT person!)",

I'm a big fan of their endless fondue specials they have occasionally; or at least, I am now.  They've recently changed what all is 'endless' for these; it's now a single cheese course, a salad, endless entree course, and endless dessert course (dippers AND chocolate).  I did mention something in my reservation notes about how the last time I'd been there the endless fondue wasn't truly endless; and it's apparent they had a few complaints because they changed it all up. The manager was actually at the door when I arrived and mentioned my comments and welcomed me back wholeheartedly.  I sat at the bar with a wonderful bartender, and ended up buying a bottle of wine as well. My experience was amazing, and relaxing. It's exactly what I want every experience to be.  In fact, I'll be going back for their weekend brunch/lunch this upcoming Sunday. No, it's not endless; but looks to be just as enjoyable!",

We were sat upstairs (great for people watching) but we're then ignored. We spent about 3 hours here. The first 45 minutes were waiting on our cheese (first course). Subsequently, we then waited for the remaining courses. We could have spent half the time at a restaurant that celebrated with us.",

Gone is the intimacy that made this a great date night and quiet fondue experience and it's replaced with the seating of a chili's. You sit right on top of your neighbor. So much so that we could hear every word of 2 conversations around us and we certainly weren't trying. I get it. You want to pack as many people in to make a profit but that's the whole reason I won't be visiting as often as I used to. The food is still decent and service is great but the atmosphere is what dinged the stars here.",

Because it is more of an experience than a quick meal, make sure you have 2 hours or so to spend here.  It is tough to get out in any less time for dinner.    For the starting portion of the meal I always do the Wisconsin cheddar fondue.  It pairs great with the breads, fruits, and veggies they serve with it.  I would like to try the bacon jalapeno and some of there other options, but the standard cheddar is tough to pass up.  For the main fondue I have had the classic and the steak lovers.  Both are great.  The staff is always very helpful in explaining how long to keep the meat in depending on if you want it medium rare, medium, etc.  The filet medium rare is amazing!  For the desert fondue I have had the original chocolate and the s'mores.  I like the s'mores a little better, but the original is great as well.  Some items they give you don't seem like they would pair well with the desert, but they know what they are doing so give everything a try.",

We had the steak lovers option with the alpine cheese and California salads. We ended with the turtle chocolate fondue that has candies pecans. The alpine was delicious but has a milder flavor than the others. I love the crispy green apples with cheese!

    "text": "The Melting Pot is such a fun experience and so different than the normal restaurant vibe.  When you walk in, you can tell you're in a nice and kind of fancy place, but once you sit down, everything is so interactive that it becomes really so much fun!   I highly recommend looking on the website under the events section to find the specials for the month, because each month there are lots of discounts offered.  I often use the weekend brunch special that gets you cheese fondue, salad, entree (steak, chicken, shrimp and ravioli), and chocolate fondue all for about $30 a person, which is a pretty good deal for The Melting Pot.  Another tip is that if you register on their website a few days before you go, they will send you a special coupon for free chocolate covered strawberries! So yummy!   The servers here are very knowledgeable about the entire menu so don't be afraid to ask for suggestions.  They will also teach you about the cooking times for each item, so don't worry if you're not quite sure what you're doing before you start.  My last piece of advice is that if you get too full for the chocolate fondue portion...which is sadly what sometimes happens to me, you can ask your server or the manager to write you an IOU and you can come back another day to enjoy your chocolate fondue.  I highly recommend melting pot for a great date night or a fun night out with friends!",

I hadn't been to this location in a while and was surprised at how big it is now! It used to be across the street in the mall but now has its own huge 2 floor location. We had made reservations and were seated right away. We ordered the Wisconsin Cheddar and the Quatro Formaggio. Unfortunately, we then waited 1 hour to get our cheese. The only thing we had gotten was our water, which our waitress had accidentally spilled all the glasses resulting in broken glass under the table. We were starving as our reservation was at 7:45 and our cheese did not come out until 8:40ish. The Wisconsin cheddar was delicious as was the Quatro Formaggio. Even though the Wisconsin Cheddar sounds pretty simple, it was definitely my favorite of the two! Our waitress was kind enough to bring more dippers. The house salad was fine. For dessert, we had the flaming turtle and chocolate s'mores. Both were super decadent and creamy. There was a great variety of dippers from fruit, rice krispies, marshmallows, pound cake, and brownies. Overall, the food was 4 stars, but I am giving it 3 stars for the terribly long wait for our cheese courses.",

    "text": "Definitely a very interesting and unique experience for dinner. I was impressed with how elaborate the meal process is and how much control you have with your order. We started with the cheese course with Fiesta and Spinach Artichoke. The spinach artichoke was the table favorite but the bread, veggies, chips, and apples also went very well with the fiesta cheese dip. For the second course we ordered salads. I got the Caeser Salad, it was good, nothing impressive or different from what I could have made myself quickly at home. Next was the entree, which I chose to build my own and got the dry rub pork, teriyaki beef, and Cajun filet. For 2 of our broths we got the regular, but we also ordered mojo broth to try. They gave us a bunch of different sauces for the whole table to drip out meats in; also provided recommendations of which went best with what meat. The meat was great, I liked having the control of how well done it was and I got to mix up what sauce to pour on it and discover the best combination. I preferred the regular broth over the mojo, and my beef over pork. Everything was very good though! Cooking the meat involved some coordination with 10 people and we had some meat come off the stick, but we were able to scoop them out with the rescue spoon provided. Lastly, dessert, by far my favorite part of the meal. We ordered the Flaming Turtle, Cookies and Cream, and Milk Chocolate. Cookies and Cream was delicious! Everything I dipped in there, from brownies to fruit, to waffles, was extremely good and I wanted more. It was a fun experience and I recommend people go at least once.   Our waitress was very attentive and accommodating. Some of us had allergies and he made sure we were safely eating with every new course and sauce.  If you come here, I recommend making a reservation. The meal process takes over 2 hours and even at 9pm at night the restaurant was full. Also, expect a larger bill because food is expensive, especially with add ons.",

It's such a fun experience when you get the 4 course meal which includes cheese fondue, salad, entree fondue and dessert fondue. It is a lot of food though so definitely come hungry! I've only ever done the 4 course meal but they do have other options which would be less but I think doing all the courses is part of the fun! When you do it this way you choose your type of cheese fondue (served with vegetables, apples and bread for dipping), salad, type of broth to cook or entree and type of dessert fondue. I've honestly never had anything I didn't like, so I don't think you can go wrong!   The restaurant is intimate but casual. Reservations recommended but not necessary. They have a delicious cocktail menu as well, my favorite being the white peach cosmo! I've always had excellent servers who are helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. It is a little more expensive, approximately $35-$50 per person depending on what you get. The food had always been fresh, seasoned well and delicious! Well worth it in my opinion.   Looking forward to my next visit! If you've never been here, you've got to give it a shot!",

    "text": "My husband and I frequent the Melting Pot several times a year, and our visit to the Station Square location last night was a birthday treat celebration / weekend away in Pittsburgh.  I made us a reservation for 8:15 pm via phone last week and reserved a hotel as Pittsburgh is about 3 hours from our home.  When we arrived at 8:00 pm the restaurant was unusually busy.  We checked in and were told that they were \"a little behind\" but would get us seated as quickly as possible.  After waiting for 30 minutes (15 min past our reservation), we checked with the host and he informed us that they were still seating 7:30 tables and would get to us as soon as possible.  I asked to see a menu while we waited (even though we know the menu by heart, we like to peruse each MPs local specialties).  It was then that we discovered that it was a set menu for the night - with zero flexibility.  I was NOT told this over the phone or I would not have made the reservation for this weekend!  Fast forward another 40 minutes and we were finally seated, nearly an hour after our reservation time.  Imagine our dismay at rounding the hostesses station and discovering that the new location is set up like a Cheesecake Factory - very open and very loud.  Gone was our intimate restaurant with tucked away booths for quiet conversations over wine.  Our table was in an alcove directly behind the hostess desk; why anyone would seat a table there was beyond me.  It was cold and drafty from being too near the door, we overheard very rude and inappropriate comments from the staff about customers (including a waitress yelling \"this is f*cking stupid\" as she stomped off\", and it was directly by the bathrooms, so there was a constant stream of people being seated or using the restroom cutting through what should have been a romantic dinner out.    The final insult was discovering that the set menu did not have the cheese we wanted and that no substitutions could be made, despite the higher price tag, and I could not order my wild mushroom sachetti.  Normally my husband and I would have upgraded to extra desserts, done a wine flight, and maybe even the charcuterie board for cheese, but the overpriced, preset menu meant that we were looking at $150+ just for dinner and tip.   The food was good otherwise, and our server (Denise) was gracious - the two stars are for her great service.  However, we will never be back to this location.  What a disappointing way to spend my husband's birthday weekend, driving 3 hours and dropping a couple hundred bucks on a hotel and dinner only to discover it wasn't what we expected at all.  The redesigned restaurant has certainly lost something, including us as customers.",

We went for my sister's birthday and she forgot to call heard for her Birthday strawberries but Alex was able to check with the kitchen and get some for her. The new set up if different and doesn't have booths but each table has two burners.",

    "text": "Pros: - Cheese fondue is excellent.  Chocolate fondue is excellent.  Who doesn't love dipping things in cheese or chocolate?  The Melting Pot gives you bread, veggies, and apples for the cheese, and a whole tray of delicious goodies for the chocolate - cheesecake, brownies, strawberries, bananas, marshmallows.  There are also multiple kinds of cheese and chocolate fondues. - Service is really good.  If it's a special occasion, you can order flowers to be waiting at the table.  Because it was our five-year anniversary, our waitress brought us just enough champagne to do a toast, at no charge.  They tucked us away in a private little booth, but we weren't forgotten.  The cons: - I'm surprised no one mentioned this, but I thought the entree was really bland.  You heat up your entree in broth, which doesn't add much flavor.  It's basically diet food.  Even the wide array of yummy sauces couldn't save the vegetarian entree.  My boyfriend ordered chicken, chorizo, shrimp and something else, and his came with spices already on the meats, so it was slightly better than mine.  The consensus was that it would be a lot faster and a lot cheaper to come and just get cheese & chocolate fondues, and maybe a drink.  I definitely look forward to doing that again sometime soon.",

For two people we usually get a 2 person size cheese fondue, 2 salads, and one entree, which ends up around $45 bucks  Oh and I would avoid this place if you are a vegetarian and especially if you are vegan.",

For the fondues, you can have as many helpings to the food that goes for the cheese fondue.   If you live in Pittsburgh or go here often, make sure to join their mailing list. They have great specials often for cheese, dessert, and wine specials as a package. It's a great thing to do on the weekends, hanging out with friends, and I would say up to 4 people could all share the dessert and cheese fondues.  Atmosphere is warm and romantic, they have areas where you don't even realize there are other patrons. They also take special requests, such as flowers, chocolate, waiting for you at the table if it's a special occasion. If you order the whole meal, you can definitely spend at least 2 to 3 hours slowly enjoying all of the food!",

    "text": "My husband and I went to the Melting Pot on a whim last night.  Despite the fact that we didn't have a reservation, we were lucky enough to find a seat at the bar.  We ordered from the prix fixe menu.  I had the Fondue Delight and my husband had the Fondue Fusion.  Both were really, really good with the coq au vin cooking bouillon.  For our cheese course, we chose the Traditional Swiss Cheese fondue and that came with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots and a nice helping of bread cubes.  My only complaint is that there was a heavy alcohol taste to the cheese sauce... it might have benefited from being cooked a bit longer to remove some of the alcoholic taste.  But, it was very good.  We chose the spinach mushroom salads for our second course.  The mushrooms and spinach were very fresh and quite tasty with the shallot vinaigrette that it came with.  The main courses were excellent but the bartender's estimation of cooking times were not very accurate and led to undercooked food.  Fortunately, I am a cook, so we were able to gauge when stuff was appropriately cooked.  The bartender told us that the potatoes should take about 10 minutes... they took 30.  The chicken, about 3 minutes.  It was about 5.  The shrimp and lobster, he said 1 minute.  I cooked them for about 2-3 minutes.  So, you need to be familiar with what undercooked feels like - rather than looks like (because the place is very dim).  We chose the bananas foster for our dessert course along with some 10 year old port.  The bartender told us that he was out of the 10 year old port, but was kind enough to up-sell us to the 20 for an extra dollar.  It was well worth it!  The dessert course was phenomenal!  It came with bananas, strawberries, rice krispie treats, cheesecake, red velvet cake cubes, chocolate cake cubes, and various flavors of marshmallows.  Overall, while it was an expensive meal, we left feeling good and happy for the experience.  I think sitting at the bar was fun because we got to talk to other customers and share our experiences with them.  I would not visit the Melting Pot every week but it is a wonderful special occasion place that I highly recommend.  We will be back.",

We had a large, loud, birthday crowd and our our waiter and waitress  were very patient and helpful. We had called ahead and reserved so they had sat us in the large back room which was perfect for this rowdy bunch!  We all ordered the Couples special which included 3 courses for around $42, which is an excellent price.  We had an odd number of people, but just ordered an extra couples special and shared all around.  There was more than enough food!  I really enjoyed the cheese fondue and LOVED the chocolate desert fondue.  Since we had a larger group, we were able to try several of the cheese and chocolate options and all were great.  I wasn't a fan of the meat course, although the shrimp, chicken, and beef pieces looked fresh and perfect.  This was a personal issue and not a fault of the Melting Pot.  I just don't think I am a fan for the flavor of boiled beef - it's not exactly comparable to steak on the grill!    I would definitely head back for desert any day though!",

The cheese and chocolate fodues are decadent and hit the spot. They provide a great selection of things for dipping (for cheese they offer bread and veggies and for chocolate the plate has bananas, strawberries, marshmallows, cheesecake, pound cake, and brownies).   My husband and I went once for the Big Night Out -- a three course meal of cheese fondue, the main course of meats you cook in a broth, and then a dessert of chocolate. We felt like we were there forever. And I think we were there for at least three hours! This is in part because of the time it takes you to cook the raw meats of the main course in the fondue broth. We were not prepared for such a long experience. Some people may love this. We didn't. And we thought it was expensive. Since then, we have gone just for the cheese and chocolate -- just as satisfying, much quicker, and cheaper.   I had my 30th bday party here, too. For our party of about 16 people, they had set up a long table in a private room. It was nice to have the privacy. We ordered four kinds of chocolate fondue and therefore got to sample lots of sweet flavors. It was a lot of fun!  Whenever you plan to go, definitely make a reservation! They get really busy. It's the only place of its kind in the city!! Also, if you're looking for an especially romantic experience, there are some tables that are kind of secluded and you feel like you're in your own little alcove in the restaurant. I'm sure these tables can be specially requested.",

I was under the assumption that you had to order the full prix menu (it appeared that people were coming in to bar and just having cheese or chocolate- no big deal we wanted the full experience anyway!) of cheese, salad, entree and dessert - it surprised me it was so pricey $110 for 2.  We figured it was worth it and ordered our cheese (crab - very horseradishy - which we love), salad - Strawberry Almond - excellent!, entree was combo platter of filet, lobster, shrimp, marinated chicken, marinated strip steak, salmon, ravoli & vegetables - with the oil - all the meat, sauces were excellent.  The least spectacular course was unbelievably the chocolate lol - we got the Raspberry Milk chocolate and it was good but I guess I would have enjoyed a dark chocolate one more - the assortment of dippables was very good - cheesecake, rice krispie treats, strawberries, marshmellows etc.   All in all it was an excellent experience and meal - my bf and I love cooking together so it was not overwhelming for us - (I did over hear other people who were a bit confused or over whelmed though)  We will be back for another special occasions and the experience has inspired us to try it at home too!  Our meal with bottle of wine and tip topped out at $160.",

    "text": "I am in love with The Melting Pots new location!  They are still in station square, just next to the hotel now.  The space is very open and inviting now with a variety of tables, even some outside on the patio.  It comes off much more casual, where you could do chocolate fondue with friends after going to the movies, not just for special occasion date night anymore.  I think that the very best part may be that a table for 4 now has 2 burners. So now you only need 2 people to agree on the cooking selections, not all 4.  As always the service was wonderful. And the food was delicious. We came for restaurant week and it did not disappoint.  Our favorite was the green goddess fondue, this should definitely be added to the regular fondue menu.",

    "text": "How do one summarize the experience at The Melting Pot?  It's pretty much tiny food portion with \"fun experience\" on the side.  The place itself is nice and fancy and staff is very friendly and helpful but their menu is definitely confusing. If you are a first timer, you will need some time to figure it all out.  I didn't get the 4 courses meal because i thought that would be too much food but oh i was so wrong. Their entree portion was very small. You get about 4 small cubes or 4 small slices for each type of meat and you get to choose 3 or 4 kinds of meat. So they charge you about $2/ small slice of meat. I only tried the cheese and the entree and the bill was about $36/person. For this reason, i do think it would be better to just get their 4 courses meal for $46/person.  Flavors wise, i didn't find anything amazing about the the food. Everything is mediocre.  \"Fun Experience\" just means you get to cook your food on your table. But really, The Melting Pot is just a westernize overpirce not as tasty KBBQ or Hot Pot place.  One time is enough!",

This location is fairly new (they moved across the street) and I really liked the different ambiance! It's more open and brighter than other Melting Pots I've been to, but still romantic. Our waiter was extremely friendly, taking time to chat with us while he was making our fondue. I'm a vegetarian, but my boyfriend is not, and they were able to accommodate my need for a separate cooking broth pot with no issues! I really appreciated that.  We went during their $45 endless fondue event, and it was great. We got 2 cheese fondues, salads, endless entrees, and endless chocolate fondue and we were STUFFED by the end (in the best way). We were also there for almost 3 hours, so don't come if you're in a rush. Again it's a little pricey, so I probably wouldn't come here unless there was a promo happening again, or I would just get cheese and chocolate. But I really appreciate that they try to give you an experience, not just a meal.",

    "text": "Visited here with my partner for my birthday.  He made reservations ahead of time, so we only waited 5 minutes or so for our table. The waiting area is a bit small and cramped but if you made a reservation, you won't wait long. There's also a nice bar area to grab a drink before you're seated.  The inside is beautiful - modern & clean, with lower lighting and comfortable, spacious seating.  Though we shared a booth with another couple, there was a partition between us and we did not feel like we were dining on top of them.   Since my birthday is 2/13, we were able to take advantage of the Cupid's Combo. We ordered the Quattro Formaggio cheese fondue, both got house salads, mojo-style cooking, with s'mores chocolate fondue for dessert!  The Quattro Formaggio was delicious and melt, though we did notice a slightly sharp/bitter aftertaste, almost chemical-ly, and wondered if the basil oil was a bit too bitter. We enjoyed the variety of breads, celery, carrot, broccoli, and apples to dip in.  The side salads were fresh and delicious, and a welcome course after the heavy cheese.  The entree was plentiful and delicious - we each had 2 cheese raviolis, 3 seasoned scallop bites, 3 large shrimp, 5 pieces of marinated Cajun-y marinated chicken, 4 pieces of filet, and 4 pieces of teriyaki sirloin. They provided a flight of different sauces, all of which were tasty and went well with the meal. I just would have liked to see something to go with the ravioli- a pesto, marinara, or Alfredo would have worked fine. There was also a bowl of whole white mushrooms, potatoes, and broccoli florets as a side dish.   Here's where I struggle. This was an AWESOME experience. Our waitress was very detailed in explaining how long to cook our food and the best combos with the sauces. We threw a few pieces of vegetables in every so often, but we were eating one piece of meat every few minutes. We also had a phone timer out for some of the items (chicken and scallops) to make sure they were cooked correctly. It was a lot of work to keep on top of everything while trying to have conversation and such!  The s'mores dessert was heavenly. I would 100% recommend this item for anyone who enjoys the campfire treat. They provided us with a large flight of pound cake, brownies, strawberries, pineapple, waffles, bananas, chocolate covered marshmallows, and rice marshmallow  treats. This was definitely hands down the best part of the meal (and I'm not even a huge dessert person typically).   Like I said, this is a VERY fun and unique dining experience. If you are able to visit near a major holiday, like Valentine's Day or NYE, you'll get the best deal because this is when they offer really great dining packages. For a first date, double date, an anniversary, a birthday, or congratulating a job promotion, this is your place! Not sure what to do on a Tuesday night after a long day? I wouldn't personally choose here.  This is also the type of place where I would come with a few girlfriends to share some cheese/chocolate fondue and cocktails!   I would definitely give this place a go. If you're like me and you've always wanted to try it, consider checking it out during the holidays to get a good deal, or start off small with a single course fondue to see if it's your thing.    Enjoy!!",

The atmosphere was nice--looks modern and it's cool to see everyone else's steaming pots. Our table happened to be a bit dark but it was fine.  We ended up waiting for our waitress for 20-25 minutes after being seated which was slightly annoying, although it was busy. We just didn't have water or a good idea of how the menu system worked, so it didn't seem like the best service.   I've never had fondue before so this was all a new experience. We both ordered the 4 course with different items (cheese, salad, entree, chocolate). The food was good but I don't think it was anything special. The cheese fondues were okay. We both ordered different salads and both were rather good.  For the entree, we got a soup based fondue and an oil based fondue--everything is self cook and we ended up mostly frying everything in the oil. The entrees come with a bunch of different sauces and I quite liked battering up my meats and frying them. The chocolate fondue came with a lot of assorted items and look really cool when they light it on fire.   Overall I'd say it's an experience that you should try if you've never tried something like it before. I didn't think the food was anything amazing tasting, but it seems like a good place to bring friends or celebrate a birthday.",

Also, the ticket machines are my friend's $5. So that was fun.   However the food and drink were good. I mean chocolate fondu can't be bad. I wish more fruit came on the side, for the price. The drink was super cute because it was in a mini fondu pot. It was fun! But I'd rather go somewhere where parking wasn't as much of an issue for the location.",

There is no way you can go into this place with a date and spend less than 50 dollars unless you share a single item and the restaurant purposely tries to get around you doing that by making the portion sizes just small enough that it would be ineffective for two people to share. The fondue and the offerings themselves are not bad, per se. I wouldn't blame the kitchen for my experience here. The front of house is just that atrocious. Service is slow and disinterested and the waiter only seemed to perk his ears up when pushing the most expensive menu items, otherwise, he couldn't be bothered. There are very few restaurants I have ever wanted to just get out of as quickly as The Melting Pot.  I hate giving one star reviews. I really do. I try to not give them if there is any redeeming quality of my experience. However, even the food, which I should say was not bad, was just so overpriced that I couldn't enjoy it. I sincerely hope they will consider lowering their prices and fixing the issues with the wait staff. I will go back and try again if this ever comes to pass. Otherwise, there are better places in the city where I can eat for less than fifty bucks.",

    "text": "This place is always packed! Make a reservation! Came here 6pm on a Saturday without a reservation. Of course everything was taken and the wait time for a table was over 2 hours, but we were lucky to sit at the bar, which is equipped with a hot plate to enjoy a full fondue meal.  The waiters take an active part in your meal experience. They set up and operate the hot plate, making your fondues for you. Both waiters/bartenders at the bar were very friendly and courteous. Very well mannered and charismatic. The chit chat was genuine and pleasant.  The ambiance is casual and relaxed. Dimmed lighting, booths, tables, a bar. Good for big groups. Good for any occasion--date, friend or family hangout, or just a treat in the middle of the week.  You can order anything off the menu, people usually do a four course meal, but we did a three course, as we weren't that hungry.   For the first course, the cheese fondue, we got was Formaggio ($9.95 per person). Earthy and herbacious, as the menu describes it. A mix of Buttercase, Mozzarella, Fontina, Parmesan, and herbs. Could definitely feel those herbs. Comes with bread, apple, celery and carrot dippers. I was honestly expecting more. The cheeses aren't of the highest quality, and I'm very into good cheeses, so for me this fondue was underwhelming. You could taste that distinct aftertaste of cheap cheese. Cheese connoisseurs should look for a different cheese fondue place, not a chain, which saves on ingredients and charges such below average prices.   Then we got the salads. Caesar and California ($5.95 per person). The portions are really tiny--just a slight appetizer bite to get your appetite going, so keep in mind that a three course meal might not leave you full. The salads were fresh and flavorful. Simple Caesar, nothing new or extraordinary. Recommend the California--mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, candied pecans, gorogonzolo cheese, house made cranberry vinaigrette, which was as sweet as dessert sauce, so be prepared for the sweetest salad of your life. The salad was tasty, just very sweet and reminded me of a dessert rather than an appetizer.  The crowning jewel of the fondue experience for me was the dessert. All the menu options are so enticing and delicious--choosing a chocolate will be the hardest decision of your day. Glad I went with the gut and got the Flaming Turtle ($9.95 per person). The waiter flambes the chocolate in front of you, pouring the shot of liquor in the pot \"to give the turtle some flight!\" Then in go caramel and caramelized pecans. The result--heavenly sweet perfection!   Each dessert fondue comes with a delicious plate of small dipping goodies. Strawberries, bananas, pineapples, shortcake, brownie and blondie bites, crispy rice treats, marshmallows, waffles. Dipping all that into caramel chocolate is every sweet addict's dream. Just perfect. You can also order additional, deluxe, sweets for dipping for $5 more per person. Wish the experience could last forever. Licked our plates clean!  The prices of this chain are very reasonable. A solid meal for the price. Service and ambiance are great for any occasion. Definitely recommend and will be back.",

The waitress came over when we sat down and quickly said I'll let you look at the menu and didn't even offer us water. She didn't come back to our table for another 25 minutes...after we had to ask the hosts and other servers to find where our server went. Also, I went to the bathroom twice during my experience and realized where all the servers went...on phone calls in the bathroom!  The food was fine, not amazing for the price you pay. The oil was definitely too hot and my food would burn in 20 seconds but wouldn't be cooked on the inside. Our server said that sometimes that just happens. It definitely made the whole experience more stressful. We didn't get an amazing explanation of everything from the start besides that meat is 2 minutes and seafood is 1 minute 45 seconds. I was a little confused with portion sizes as well. Me and my boyfriend ordered separate 4 course meals (paying around $47 each) but still ended up getting one plate of food.",

If you order the 4 course meal, expect to be here for at least two hours (if not more), which is why it's a great location for an evening out with friends. The food is tasty, especially the cheese and chocolate. Who doesn't like hot cheese and chocolate? Since you have to cook your own main course, you naturally slow down and don't overeat. The main negative is the price. It's very expensive, so I'd only come here once a year at most, especially since the whole point is for this to be a novelty experience. I think this would quickly get old if I came more often. Overall, it's probably not going to be the best meal you'll ever have, but it may be the most fun!",

They recently moved across the street and have an updated style. It is a lot less romantic, dark, cozy, ect and more like most other restaurants now. Some of the booth seats are split with a small piece of glass between them, which is a little weird, but It does look like It would make expanding the table easier. They do also have an outdoor patio which is heated when it is cooler.  Staff is always friendly and good! They now make the cheese in the back and bring it out, instead of at your table,however everything else is made at your table still!  I usually come here and only get cheese, salad, and dessert. Adding the dinner portion seems to be too much for me.  Also I always add in the extra side for the cheese and dessert! It is so worth it!",

The cheese fondue (beer one) was great--we were really big on the apples and veggies and our server brought us more to dip without us even asking, no charge!  The chocolate fondue was okay--we got dark chocolate but it was still overly sweet for my taste so the bf got to eat most of it.  Still, considering MP's usual prices, this was a steal.  They do Late Night Fondue the last hour before close, I think every day of the week (though their hours vary).    And thanks to PA law, you can get the wine recorked--we only drank half the bottle and were able to bring it home.  If you want to experience MP but not willing to shell out $60/person for the full shebang, I definitely recommend the late night deal.  Note--this is a PGH-only deal.  Other cities have other promotions, so watch out for that!",

    "text": "Melting Pot Madness-Part 2!  Course Three: Fondue Fusion Fantasia continues...  Figuring out what went best with what became a marvelous game of culinary match-up, but the sour cream sauce was a dark horse that worked with pretty much everything. Or would that make it a Joker? Why...so...serious?  The sirloin was our Alpha. Each chunk was dropped into the oil/broth, and we waited impatiently for each to finish cooking. Once the first morsel came out, I found the creamy curry sauce to be the best coating for it. Then it was the chicken, which also worked brilliantly with the curry. The pork followed, bathing nicely in the sweet/sour sauce after its spell in the roiling stew. The two ravioli went in next, and once they bubbled to the surface, we found that the curious Gorgonzola port had its number.  Kay and I saved the best three for last. The filet mignon was dunked into the garlic butter, the shrimp into the fiery cocktail sauce, and our Omega, the lobster tail, also baptized in garlic butter. Pure seafood euphoria captured in four chunks, our lobster was cooked ideally; soft, plump, saturated. My eyes rolled back. Kay sighed. Kayleigh came to our table just as we ate the final bites of lobster, acting as if she had caught us doing...the devil's business, and we were left wanting more.  The Devil. Satan. The Adversary. Call Him what you will, His accursedness created the final course.  Course Four: Dark and Dulce Chocolate Fondue  Such was the name of dessert, and a carnal cauldron it was, a vat of villany, a stein of sin to which we were hopelessly drawn.   A baneful bittersweet chocolate united with a demonic dulce de leche to snatch our souls from our bodies, using marshmallows, poundcake, brownies, strawberries, and because it was Kay's birthday, a whole cut of cheesecake (complete with a lone candle lanced through it) as emissaries. A shaker of sea salt stood by to make each treat sing its sinister siren songs even louder, hissing like Galder, wailing like King Diamond. The Cheesecake was particularly divine, made infernal by that succulent, deadly, decadent black crud.   As we were about to fully succumb to the lava, our love in grave danger of being stolen by Mephisto, Kayleigh broke the spell by bringing us each a glass of champagne. Our souls were now cleansed, our romantic bond renewed, our roundtrip into Heaven, Hell, and Earth finished.  P.S. I really can't say enough positive things about the service. Kayleigh is The Patron Saint Of All Waitresses. In addition to the balloons and chocolate bar, she also gave Kay a bottle of TMP's own Garlic Wine seasoning since she liked it so much on her salad.   P.P.S. Metaphysical hyperbole aside, I feel it must be noted that The Melting Pot is a staunch supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a worthy charity...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meltingpot.com%2Fthe-experience%2Fcommunity.aspx&s=740bffe64e5e03807b8653bfe8ba5cc032dfa71df7cd7bfbc937ff357e877035\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">meltingpot.com/the-exper...</a>",

You start with cheese fondue which comes with bread and veggies to dip. Then you get a yummy salad. The entrees usually come with chicken, steak, shrimp, etc. . . and you cook them in oil on your table. This is great because you can cook your food exactly how you like it. Lastly, you finish up the meal with the chocolate fondue which comes with rice crispy treats, marshmallows, brownies, fruit, etc . .   This may seem like a lot of food but you go at your own pace. You never feel rushed and this is a great way to spend 2-3 hours having dinner in Station Square or any other Melting Pot location.

We again took the recommendation of our waitress for the up-sell of the coq au vin cooking liquid which was a mistake for scallops, by the time they cooked, they picked up TOO much of the flavor of the scallops, but the steak I tried was very good and the liquid complimented it well.  The dessert was the star of the show, the bananas foster.  Top notch and wonderful.  Overall 3 stars, too long of a meal, nothing was remember-able except the dessert.

We got a romantic little corner booth. They have some interesting \"speciality\" drinks. I got a pomegranate Cosmo which was really good, BJ got his usual beer. We were kinda familiar with the menu, but needed our server's help with selecting our fondues. We ordered off the \"Alpine Big Night Out\" special menu. Sure, the restaurant is a bit pricey, but we got a lot to eat. Our first course included different types of bread, veggies and apples for dipping. We each got a very delicious salad, BJ's included Gruyere and fontina cheeses, hard-boiled eggs & honey roasted almonds with a yummy shallot vinaigrette. I got a California salad, with mixed baby greens, Roma tomatoes, walnuts, Gorgonzola and raspberry black walnut vinaigrette. Their salads were so, so good! At this point we were pretty much full!   Then came our main course. We got a lobster tail, NY strip, bratwurst, filet mignon, marinated shrimp, chicken, ravioli's and veggies. I'm not sure what type of cooking broth we got, but your server can tell you what goes best with what you are ordering. It was really a lot of fun cooking our little bites and my boyfriend took charge of cooking all our vegetables. I was kinda put off at first of the thought of steak being cooked in broth. I like my meat seared a bit. But believe me, it was delicious. We also enjoyed the different sauces.   We could not pass on dessert, we got the Flaming Turtle, which was milk chocolate and chopped pecans \"flambeed\" at our table. We got strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, Rice Krispies treats, pound cake and brownies. Lot's of fun!!   Also, thanks to yelper Angel for the heads up about their \"mailing list\". We visited their website and got a coupon that saved us $16 on our dinner, which was very nice. I'm a girl that like to think I got a deal!",

    "text": "Maybe I am just a sucker for romantic atmospheres -- I love The Melting Pot with a capital \"L\"  Start with dessert first. Not literally, I mean, it's up to you. This is my favorite part and I am drooling just thinking about it right now. The chocolate fondue in several variations, paired with fresh fruit, cake, and more (it's to DIE for). Well, maybe not DIE, I tend to exaggerate when it comes to things I love. But I'm a big chocolate enthusiast, so of course, this is something I look forward to every time I visit The Melting Pot. The servers are very casual and usually quite knowledgeable, and don't really force you into settling for a payment plan if all you want is an appetizer. I only say payment plan because a meal for two is actually quite expensive, especially if you go all out and get wine, drinks, etc. The appetizer fondue is amazing as well. With the cheese or chocolate fondue, you pick any combination you like of what they have to offer, the choices are basically unlimited. The appetizers come with vegetables and an array of fresh bread bits. The ambiance is really nice, generally quiet, romantic, lights dimmed way down low. I have good memories of this place, and it's in a nice location of Pittsburgh in Station Square looking over the river. The sad thing is, you really wouldn't want to take your date out to any of the clubs next door afterwards, unless you wanted her to get groped in a corner on her way out of the bathroom or trashed talked to by some fugly wigger or wiggette. Sad but True.  The parking is in a garage close to the mall where The Melting Pot is located, and is relatively inexpensive, which honestly, will be the least of your concerns when dining here.",

Everything started off well, our server was very friendly and explained how the menu worked. We were not served our cheese for about an hour and refills on waters took way too long through out the dinner. After sitting for two hours and ten minutes before being served our entrees, I decided to talk to the manager about the disappointment in timeliness. (The restaurant was NOT terribly busy). He explained the average turn over time was about 2.5-3 hours for a party this large which I was unaware of. He informed us he would take some money off the bill as well as give us a voucher for free chocolate our next time dining. The final time was 3.5 hours for dinner, our drinks didn't get the final refill we had requested, and it was just an overall \"meh\" experience service wise. The food was good but I will definitely not be back. The service was enough for a one time experience. Thanks for the 15% but as Cyrus Rose always says \"not enough!\"",

I tried various desserts and I love almost all of them. As for the main course, obviously lobster is wonderful if you are willing to pay for it!  I think it's the BEST place for chocolate fondue (white, milk, dark)",

Had the Valentine's special menu - which I thought was a great value for 50/person.  Four courses - cheese, salad, meats (lobster, shrimp, filet, sirloin, chicken and ravioli ) and any of the chocolate desert fondues to finish.

Then our salads; I had Caesar and somehow it was one of the best salads I have ever had. Our main courses were packed with lobster, shrimp, steak, chicken, and potatoes which we dipped in the fondue pot of courses, with additional dipping sauces!  You gotta get desert - trust me!! Chocolate fondue...dipping graham crackers, marshmallows, Rice Krispy Treats.....oh we were so full of delicious food.  This place is not cheap, but if you want a one-of-kind dining experience, try the Melting Pot!",

We asked our waitress Julia a TON of questions because we were confused on how to order things, and she graciously answered everything well and provided us with great suggestions to enhance our experience. J and I both did the 4- course meal including the four cheese fondue to start, house salads with peppercorn ranch dressing, surf and turf (J), create your own meal with sesame covered tuna, Atlantic salmon, and chicken (me), and the s'mores chocolate fondue for dessert. The food was pretty good and they give you a decent portion for each. At first, we were confused about the whole \"cook your own food\" aspect, but it made the experience really interesting. The s'more fondue was everything! J and I demolished ours pretty quickly. Our bill came to a little over $100, which was decent given the quality and amount of food, Julia our waitress, and the overall experience.",

However, I thought it to be slightly overpriced, even for the amount of food we got. The temperature of our broths weren't consistent- I burnt my mouth on one, and another pot was so hot that it immediately burned my friend's teriyaki chicken each time she cooked it. There were 4 of us who went out and two of us were given two very similar shades of yellow skewers so we were constantly mixing up our meals. Our waiter was great, but it was honestly a 3 hour long experience that didn't need to be. The happy hour was only at the bar, which I was disappointed in, being that it was a Friday night and drinks were normally about $10 each. I did take advantage of one drink at the bar, which was nice. The bathrooms were clean and conveniently located near our seats. There were lots of options for everyone. Regardless if you eat meat or vegetables only, you can create your own combinations. I was never a big fan of this place for practical reasons, but it was a fun time for a girls' dinner out.",

We basically all opted for the 4-course experience, which includes cheese fondue, a salad, entree fondue, and dessert fondue. Our waiter, Tim, helped us walk through the options and gave us some recommendations on which fondues were the most popular. He was also efficient on mixing the fondues and explaining what each ingredient was while he was making them at the table.  All the food was tasty and fresh. The bread was soft, the vegetables were nice and firm, the meats were well-seasoned and tender, and the fruit/desserts were fresh as well. The cheese fondues had great flavor and depth (honestly, I could probably just do a meal of cheese fondues), the salad was just enough, the coq au vin and bourguignon fondues had good savory flavor, and the chocolates were sweet without being overly so.  Be prepared to spend an while, as each course takes a bit to prepare. The entree course takes time, as you are also cooking your own food at the table.  Overall, The Melting Pot is a great way to celebrate something with friends and family by making the whole meal a social experience.",

    "text": "My fiance and I went here for an early Valentine's Day date night and we were not disappointed! We had a reservation for 6, but arrived earlier than expected around 5:30 and they were really great and seated us right then.  Our server, Ally, was friendly and attentive and overall just went above and beyond to give us an outstanding experience.  We opted for one portion of the 4 course meal and added an extra salad after reading reviews saying the 4 courses for 2 people was way too much food. The single portion of the 4 courses was plenty and I didn't really need the extra salad, but it's a great option for couples who eat more food than we do.  We started off with the Fiesta cheese fondue which was a cheddar and emmanthaler cheese blend mixed with lager, salsa, and jalapenos. This course was served with 3 types of bread, nacho chips, apples, carrots, and broccoli. The cheese was gooey, the dippers were fresh, and you might not think apples and cheese go together, but honey, you would be surprised.  Our next course was the salads. He had the house salad with peppercorn ranch and I had the strawberry pecan. He really liked his and ate the entire thing, I wasn't a fan of the poppyseed dressing on mine and only ate about half.  The third course we chose was the classic, mojo style. It came with shrimp, mushrooms, potatoes, broccoli, two types of sirloin, pork, chicken, and duck served with 6 different sauces (of which the gorgonzola and teriyaki were our favourites). For dessert and our final course, we chose the smores chocolate fondue. With milk chocolate, marshmallow fluff, and Graham cracker crumbs all flambayed right there at the table, what more could you ask for? This round came with brownies, blondies, bananas, strawberries, oreo and graham craker coated marshmallows, pineapple, pound cake, and marshmallow treats for dipping.  All in all this meal was great and way more filling than one would expect. Between the bread for the first course, the potatoes with the third, and all of the cakes with the fourth, you really do get filled up. The atmosphere in the place is great. It's classy for a date night while still being fun and interactive.  If you are on the fence, give this place a try! It's not super cheap (we ate for about 60 dollars), but it is an awesome experience for a special night out.",

We ordered the \"fondue by you\" (or something along those lines) where we each picked three entree options along with the four course meal. We went with the normal cheddar cheese fondue (it was fabulous!). We both got the house salads, very good as well. For our entrees we got the teriyaki steak, filet, buffalo shrimp, and chicken potstickers. The meat takes a LONG time too cook, so just watch for that.We went with the normal vegetable broth cooking option. The sauces were all delicious as well. For dessert, we got the turtle chocolate, and it was fabulous!   Our server was wonderful as well, offering to bring us more veggies or dippers for each course.   It was about $100 total, which really wasn't bad given the experience. I highly recommend for a date night!  UPDATE: My boyfriend and I went again last week to celebrate the end of my semester. This time we tried the cheese option with pesto, I can't remember exactly what it was called but this was by far the best. I highly recommend this cheese over the other options!! Also we tried the oil and batter option for our entrees and I think we both preferred this to the plain broth. It is a lot and you have to be careful but it really was delicious! (remember you can get extra veggies, I love the fried broccoli!)",

It is on the pricey side, especially for food you basically prepare yourself, but the experience you have along with an excellent quality of service make it worth the occasional splurge.  My fiance and I went to Melting Pot moments after we got engaged.  When he made reservations he told them it was to celebrate our engagement and when we arrived, they had a private booth in the back along with a small grouping of carnations.  You can order roses or other flower arrangements but because we were going to the Pirates game later that evening, he didn't since he figured they would just die.  While the carnations were nothing spectacular, it was a nice touch that they didn't  have to do for us especially since he had not ordered flowers.  Service was fantastic and they were good about being attentive without being overbearing and intrusive.  We ordered the big night out with the lobster option.  All of the meat was tender and juicy and very flavorful.  Our request for extra dipping sauces and more mushrooms were met with a smile and promptly delivered.  We even joked around about getting extra pine nuts on our salads and the server brought out an entire bowl for us!  Even though we ordered a bottle of champagne to drink with our meal, our server surprised us with more champagne with heart shaped strawberries to have with our dessert course fondue.  We had a great time, left stuffed and really enjoyed having our first meal together as an engaged couple at the Melting Pot.  I have no doubt we will be back.",

I've never been to a fondue restaurant but thought it may be a fun option for the kids.   After having everything explained to us by the extremely helpful and patient waitress we placed our order.  Our family of four ( me, wife and two young boys) split two of the four course meals which ended up being the perfect amount for us.   I think overall the food was good but it was more the overall experience that made this an enjoyable night. The boys loved being able to pick and choose their own food options and following along with the cooking. It was a little tricky trying to keep track of everyone's cooking times during the main portion.  Overall I would highly recommend this place, my boys would too as they say it was their favourite meal of our trip.",

The cheese fondue came with vegetables, bread, and apples, and they all went well with the cheese, although the veges may have been better warm for the fondue. Next, we got a sweet and tangy salad with candied pecans which I thought was the best part of the meal. Lastly, we got a broth where we would cook the variety of steak, chicken, ravioli, and shrimp. It came with mushrooms, broccoli, potatoes, and 6 different sauces. Even with the variety, the meat dish kind of got boring after a while. Personally, I thought all of the food was just OK and didn't live up to the hype. However, they do give you plenty of food. Overall, it was a cool experience and worth going to at least once.",

The menu had a good selection of cheeses, meat dishes, and chocolates to finish. I personally loved the fruit style salad as well. The cooking portion of the dinner was fun although it did take time to cook many individual pieces but it gives time to actually talk and enjoy your company. I 100% recommend the chocolate fondu on any occasion though!! This was my favorite part by far. My table got the pure dark chocolate and it was to die for....a good experiences overall and the staff was friendly and very knowledgeable.",

How about sitting at a dark table while the steam blows in your face all evening?   Like fondue cheese? Well, for a mere $100 they will give you stale bread and approx 2 baby carrots to dip.  Would be good place to go just for dessert, for the new experience, but cannot imagine going more than once. Once the novelty wears off, you can get much better desserts for far less. WAY over priced. Can go to MUCH better restaurants in Pittsburgh for far less money.",

    "text": "This is a really tricky review to write and you should read until the end. I will start by reviewing my actual meal and experience dinning first. As you read the review you will understand why.   I visited the Melting Pot as my Friday choice for Restaurant Week. I made reservations in advance for 9:00 on a Friday and was excited to be taking a first timer who had no idea what the concept was. She loved the atmosphere and concept of fondue. We were seated in a cozy and very private booth.   The first course was Quattro Formaggio Fondue. The cheese was excellent and they give you plenty of options for dipping from breads - Apples.   The second course was an Apple Bacon Spinach salad. The dressing was a sweet and spicy dressing. It took me by surprise at first but was actually really good.   The third course was a chef choice platter. We choose the mojo fondue for cooking the choice meats. The choices that were offered teriyaki sirloin, jerk filet, Cajun chicken and wild mushroom sachetti. I definitely recommend the mojo.   After that I just had no room left for dessert. This is sad because I know they have an amazing chocolate peanut butter fondue. But since the servings are plentiful I just couldn't eat anymore.   With this all said they would have gotten a 4 star rating hands down... But here is the deal. We had a 9:00 reservation. We were seated at 10:00. Now I give some consideration for things out of control of an establishment. But they get 2 stars because I sat there and listened to the hostess lie to customer after customer about the wait. We were told a \"slight delay\" and waited an hour. Others were told 15-20 minutes behind when they knew the wait was at least an hour. I even brought it to their attention they know that's not accurate and they still continued to lie. I don't mind waiting but when I am lied to about the wait I was mad. I think people would not have been so upset if they were not continuously lied to all night. Also some one that had an 8:30 reservation should up at 9:10 because they were late. The showed up 40 minutes late for a reservation and 10 minutes after me (who was on time) and they were taken 15 minutes before me to a table. If you are 40 minutes late for you reservation I feel you should now wait your turn.",

I can only applaud the high quality raw food combined with a gourmet fondue experience (I had no idea fondue was more than just melted cheese) and a dedicated and attentive staff that made sure we had the night we were paying for.  Why the three stars then? Location.  The building itself is within the inside mall of Station Square, resulting in a severe lack of windows. The intimate structure of the franchise results in nearly every table somehow being in a corner, and combined with the lack of windows and dim lighting, I felt like I was in a fondue dungeon.  Business is always booming and the restaurant highly recommends reservations, as they are generally packed. A place like The Melting Pot doesn't really need Yelp reviews, because it is what it is and that's all it's going to be. It's great. I just wish it were in a location that wasn't so...heavy.",

Both times, we've gotten the four-course meal.  1) Starting appetizer is a cheese fondue with bread, celery, carrots, and fruit. Very cheesy and delicious.  2) Next is a salad, which is the only part of the meal that doesn't involve the cooking pot,  3) Third is the main course, which we ordered with ravioli, various meats, tuna, etc. The broth was delicious both times.  4) Last is the chocolate fondue. We got the yin and yang the first time, which I loved. They bring out fruit, brownies, blondies, rice krispies, and more with the chocolate fondue.   Overall I'm a huge fan of this place, even if it's on the higher end of prices I'm willing to pay. Delicious!",

    "text": "In a nutshell, it's a pricey, fun fondue experience at this well-done chain restaurant best saved for a special dress-up occasion in which you've got at least 2.5 hours to spare and you'd really like to use that time to get to know your dinner date better.  They have many options for the number of course you have (one to four) and the components in those options.  We opted for the full four course meal starting with spinach and artichoke cheese fondue, house salads with peppercorn ranch dressing, entrees of Pacific Rim and Surf and Turf with a coq au vin broth for dipping, and finally, the chocolate turtle dessert fondue.  The cheese course came with bread, apples, and veggies for dipping; the main entrees we shared included duck, shrimp, filet mignon, mushroom pockets, and lobster with 8 different dipping sauces (4 per course).  It also included potatoes and veggies.  The chocolate course was a mixture of milk chocolate and caramel and nuts with so many delicious items to dip -- bananas, pineapple, rice crispy treats, marshmallows, brownies.    I had thought it would be too much food to consume, but you'd be surprised how you just keep dipping and munching over the 2.5 hours it takes for all four courses.  It takes so long because first, you peruse the menu for several moments, order some wine perhaps, then it takes awhile for the pot set between you on your tabletop to heat up.  Once it does, the server comes back and prepares the cheese fondue from scratch, adding each ingredient and stirring until smooth and delectable.  You spend quite some time with your partner in food crime savoring the tidbits covered in gooey cheese before heading to the next course -- your salads.  A salad is a salad and may be just a distraction while they're cutting up and preparing your proteins and dips you chose.  Again, they set a pot in front of you of the broth you selected and you wait a bit for it to heat up and you're off and eating again, this time sharing the delights with your partner after the instructed amount of time for cooking them.  When all this is said and done, the chocolate course comes out and, again, it's a pot of chocolate and other decadent sins which your server prepares.  Finally, you and your partner settle in to dip, swirl anything and everything into the mixture while all the while uttering sounds of contentment.    Do you have to dress-up?  No, but when the meal takes 2.5 hours and the bill comes to 130.00 for a four course meal and some alcoholic beverages before tip and it was for a special occasion -- my husband's birthday in our case -- then, by all means I think it deserves a bit of gussying up.",

So friendly and very helpful when it came to understanding the menu and how to cook the food!!!   My girlfriend and I got the cheddar cheese fondue to start and I got the yin & yang martini (which was my favorite drink I've ever had...so delicious!!!). We then got the land and sea and the French quarter as the entrees. This included shrimp, chicken, filet mignon, and sausage. We also of course had to add a lobster tail on the side. This was just awesome food. They had six different dipping sauces that were awesome!  Everything was flavored very well and so much fun to cook!!   For dessert we got the bourbon pecan chocolate fondue with bourbon, dark chocolate, carmel, and candied pecans!! Great dipping items too! Strawberries, marshmallows covered in Oreo crumbles and graham cracker crumbles, pineapple, brownie and chocolate chip cookie bites and Rice Krispie treats. I also had the espresso martini which was great with the sweetness of the chocolate.   I would definitely go back but the bill was pretty steep because of all the drinks we ordered. But the service was the best I've had in a long time! Very personable. So it was well worth the money.",

It gives you the ability to walk around and shop or ride the incline before or after dinner!  The Melting Pot is by far my absolute favorite restaurant.   I love the ambiance - it allows for a romantic evening with your special someone!  The waitress was very nice and provided us with a great experience - she also brought us complimentary glasses of champaign for our celebration dessert!  We did the couples meal with 4 courses.  The first course is the cheese and probably my favorite!  They give you more than enough dippers!  We got to choose from 3 salads - while the dressing on the strawberry pecan was a little tangy for my liking - I ate had and my boyfriend finished.  The main course was just phenomenal!  I've never tried the lobster but wow was it good!  They give you a large platter of filet, shrimp, sirloin, lobster, chicken, and ravioli - all of which were fabulous! Now, most people I assume know Melting Pot for its dessert - we chose the snores and the dippers included pineapple, banana, strawberry, Rice Krispies, brownie, chic chip cookies, pound cake, marshmallows etc.  needless to say I felt like I needed to be rolled out of the place!  Great food for a decent price and memorable experience!  We will always return!",

He kept forgetting to refill our waters, even after visiting the table, the few times that he did. The whole experience took much longer than it should have. I understand this is an experience and takes longer than a normal dinner would, but because we hardly saw our waiter, it took longer than necessary. Food is ok, I would not pay full price and it seems horribly over priced.",
