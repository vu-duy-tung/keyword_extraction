I love everything they have and I have tried just about everything on the menu. My Vietnamese sister-in-law gives it a thumbs up for authenticity for what thats worth. The sushi blows Nakama and Little Tokyo out of the water dollar for dollar.  BYOB and they now have proper wine glasses thanks to our gift we gave them!!!(we love them so much we gave them a bunch of wine glasses for the holidays)",

The food is decent overall but for me it's like playing a slot machine -- whether its going to be ok vs. great when ordering out.",

The menu is different, there's no lunch specials anymore, (big sad face here) and I basically got half the amount of food I normally do for about 40% more... (ordered the same thing I normally get) They've definitely updated the decor, and it's much nicer. Thumbs up there.  The updated menu however...big thumbs down. There's so much less to pick from.  Bring back the lunch specials. I totally understand prices needing to go up, but to not offer lunch options, almost makes it not a lunch option anymore.  However, all of that being said...the food is still awesome. Everything is always so fresh and good and the service is always great. Everyone is very nice and the atmosphere is comfy. I love you Pho 88, I'm just a little upset with you right now. ;)",

Ordered the fresh spring rolls, which were great, especially dipped into the  hoisin sauce.  Also got the pho tai--and I will say that I prefer my beef sliced thinner.  It's a personal preference, as I'm not one to eat meat rare.  When it's sliced thin and the hot broth is poured over it, I feel it's more flavorful and tender.  My pho had chunks of thickly sliced beef that was still slightly pink, even after the soup had cooled some.  Otherwise, the soup was filling. I throw in all the sides--even the jalapenos (those damn pips can be pretty spicy at times).  I would also recommend the taro boba tea, which I never had and only ordered at the recommendation of our server. Our server was kind, and we were given \"complimentary\" ice cream at the end of our meal. All-in-all, I am happy with this place, and want to venture through their other items which are standard fare on a Vietnamese/Thai menu.  I didn't try any of the Japanese food, so I cannot attest to the quality of that.  Great service, great boba tea, good pho, enjoyable dessert.  Will be back.",

They've got truly unique General Tso, excellent Pho and yummy spring rolls. You know what else they did? They delivered. In fact, they delivered to me many times, the last of which was in early December.  So imagine my surprise when I called to order delivery on Saturday and a man on the other line told me they haven't delivered \"in a year or two.\" I asked if it was a recent change and he flat out told me no. Even though if claims free delivery on their menu, which I had acquired during a delivery less than 6 weeks ago.   So I was upset, but not devastated. I changed my order to pick-up and sent my husband through Rt 88 traffic to grab our meal. We were told 20 minutes and 45 minutes later our meal was ready. My hus an was tired of sitting there in his coat so he paid, grabbed the tied bag and left. Only to get home and realize they forgot my Pho. They provided the \"fixins,\" but no broth.   We were really upset at this point. And starving. So I called and asked that they simply remove the Pho from our tab. She was so confused and seemed to not understand that he had already made it home with the incomplete meal. As of today, it has still not been reimbursed on our card.   We're frustrated and will likely find a new Pho restaurant. So sad.",

So the delightful, potentially accidental, play on word sounds makes me giggle every time. That aside, the food is delicious, servings generous and restaurant of a small, intimate size. They're good for any age and have ample selections outside of the regular pho you'd expect.  It was a busy night, as I understand most weekend nights are, but we didn't wait long. The only thing I'd change would, perhaps, be the attentiveness of our waitress. That could be chalked up to how busy the restaurant was. I'm honestly not sure. She seemed distracted, preoccupied and wasn't on hand frequently for drink refills.  Lastly, they have thai iced bubble tea. That one thing is enough for me to want to move in and live in the back.",

My girlfriend and her friend got the Hu Tieu Ga (Noodle Soup) and Saigon Pancake Crepe which they both loved it. Need I remind, the price is very reasonable to the generous portion size.  Although they do offer various dishes, this is a Vietnamese and Japanese restaurant - so when you do go.. please stick to ordering Vietnamese and Japanese dishes. If you like Pad Thai (which I do) I suggest you go to a Thai restaurant instead.  Also, it's BYOB! which I didn't realize until we got there.",

Unlike another reviewer, I enjoyed my Pad Thai, which I had with shrimp and found to be quite flavorful. The square rice noodles were perfectly al dente yet carried with them an indescribable richness. Furthermore, the shrimp was juicy, and the bean sprouts, carrot, garlic, egg, peanut, and egg were abundant.   Our appetizer took us to the streets of Vietnam, the tender Saigon BBQ Short Ribs tantalizing our taste receptors with their honey-garlic-lemongrass marinade and cruncy, nutty sesame seed garnish.   Whether or not Pho Kim 88 makes their own desserts is doubtful, but the cheesecake Kay and I shared was a warmed-over, fluffy, lardy, beautifully presented end to a fine dinner.   Pho Kim still serves as a worthy ambassador of Asian cuisine in this quadrant of the Pittsburgh area. Give them a chance to charm you with exotic food and cordial service.",

If you are adventurous, don't be shy to try one with beef balls and tripe.  If not, go with something a little more basic.  Either way, you get the same great broth and delicious taste.  Also, if you are looking for a starter, the fresh spring rolls are a favorite along with the Catching Fire roll.  The Catching Fire is a sushi roll loaded with goodness and topped with jalapenos for the \"fire\".  Taro bubble tea tops off any meal here or you can BYOB for a very minimal fee.",

I'm a big guy and I don't feel like my mouth should be bursting with 1 piece or sushi. But like I said, the sushi is very good, good quality.",

The Pad Thai had many large shrimp with a great balance of noodles and veggies and we have enough left over for lunch tomorrow.  The fresh spring rolls were nice and cool, the perfect temp.

The inside is very nice and clean and the staff is friendly. If you can't eat in then they have the option for take out. The food is prepared quickly and cold and hot items are packaged separately (keeps the fresh items from wilting). They offer a drink while you wait which is also very nice.

The pho broth didn't quite hit the cinnamon stick and star anise blend needed to be considered good. Also, I expected the usual basil and mint leaves to accompany the traditional noodle soup but was only given bean sprouts, a lime wedge, and pepper. The service was horrible as the waitress even indicated the amount for which we should be tipping. The sandwich was above average but not $10 worth. Vietnamese coffee was very sweet and watered down. I cannot justify coming back there. I'd rather drive the extra miles to go to an authentic Vietnamese joint that doesn't charge an arm and a leg for mediocre food.",

My only complaint (and honestly, this is with any pho) is that I just want more noodles. Everybody was long done eating and I was still chowing down on my pho, seemingly unable to part with it. I left full and happy doing the Sriracha-cha-cha.   My friends all enjoyed their dinners immensely. My friend got the steak hibachi dinner special. The portions were gargantuan and she reports it was awesome. Not joking about the portions. She's having it for lunch today and I'm extremely jealous. Her daughter got the vegetable lo mein and my mom got the chicken lo mein. Again, the portions were out of control and both said it was delicious. My sister got spicy California roll and the bahn xeo and both looked delightful and were enjoyed. Her newborn baby just had milk which came from home, so I will not write a review about that.  We were all very comfortable and well taken care of the entire visit. This place is small. Intimate. I liked it. I will go here again as soon as the pho withdrawal sets in. Maybe even tomorrow.",

They serve the best fried rice I've ever tried, and that includes a lot of MUCH pricier places in Southern California.  The Royce's Roll is my favorite on the sushi/sashimi menu, and you can tell that the fish is very fresh and of the highest quality.

    "text": "We have been to this place many times and this is the first time we ordered takout. Well, we weren't let down. We ordered a bowl of pho, two spring rolls and this Vietnamese pancake/omelot thing (banh xeo). They told us it would be done in 10 minutes. We live 12 minutes away so we hurried as fast as we could.  The total was $24, not bad. The soup was packaged up into two bowls and a two bags full of goodies (basil, bean sprouts, jalepenos and limes). It was interesting to get it this way. The only difference is that I think you get less broth this way than you normally do. Their broth is really good, I usually always get a bowl of pho when I come here. This bowl was the whole cow....tripe, steak, meat balls and probably some other parts. You get a decent sized portion of the meat. Plus lots of noodles. Its a shame there wasn't more broth. The noodles were overcooked though. Perhaps this is the weakness in getting pho take out.  The spring rolls are my girlfriend's favorite. They're large and stuffed full of pork, shrimp, herbs and vermicelli into a rice paper sheet. They come with this dark sweet sauce with peanuts. I'm convinced its hoisin sauce mixed with fish sauce. I could be wrong. Its pretty tasty.  The pancake (banh xeo) thing was a large omelot stuffed with meat, bean sprouts and some other veggies. It was pretty good. I've ordered it before and it was more like an egg foo young than an omelot. This one was a large egg omelot wrapped around all the ingredients. I really like the egg foo young version more and this dish was a bit of a let down. My girlfriend liked alot more than I did.  Like I said, we've eaten there many times. They have a rather large and eclectic menu of Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese food. In addition to the pho and other Vietnamese dishes (which are great tasting and with nice presentation), they have a decent sized Japanese menu. They have a variety of teppanyaki dishes (hibachi to you yinzers), a great sushi menu, several Japanese apps and soups. My girlfriend realy likes their sushi. I've found it to be as good as any other in town and average priced. I come here for the Vietnamese food, though. Primarily their pho but I have gotten their noodle and salad dishes.  As far as service...we've never had any problems. The waitresses are nice and polite...even considering our mess-making 2 year old. The presentation of the food is always top notch. Whether its one of the Vietnamese dishes or the sushi, the cooks make every plate look amazing. The place is a little pricey. Its easy for two people to shell out $50 or more for a dinner. But considering our takeout total, its possible to eat here without breaking your wallet.",

    "text": "Phee Phi Pho YUM!!!   We had some business to take care of close by and noticed Pho Kim 88 restaurant so, being Pho lovers, we thought, \"Lucky us! It's been awhile since we had a big bowl of Pho. Let's go eat!\"  We started with the fresh spring rolls, emphasis on fresh, served with a tasty peanut sauce. I ordered a customized Pho that included seasoned tofu and lots of vegetables. Our waitress wasn't bothered one bit by my specifications. In fact, she was really helpful. My husband ordered the traditional beef Pho and liked it even better than his favorite Pho restaurant which incidentally is located in Albuquerque. (Believe it or not there are quite a few Pho restaurants there.)  Bottom line:  We really liked this place and will most definitely return.  Food was fresh and delish, service was fast and friendly, decor was sweet. Hey, what's not to love about a big happy Buddha greeting you and bidding you farewell?",

I don't eat red meat, so I really appreciate that fact that they have chicken broth for their chicken soup (hu tieu ga). The chicken broth is excellent here, and the sides of veggies and herbs are always fresh and plentiful. We had been ordering the vermicelli noodles here for years (literally) and the chicken had this terrific marinade, and they grilled it perfectly, and then one day we ordered it, and it was a if it was from another restaurant...flavorless, no marinade, really bad.  I called and complained, and they were nice and offered me a free meal, but that's not what I wanted...I wanted it back the way it was! Sometimes now it's good, and sometimes not, so inconsistency in the kitchen from cook to cook. When they iron this out, they'll get 4 stars from me.",

    "text": "With a bottle of wine in hand (hint: they're BYOB), hubs and I headed to Pho Kim for dinner on a recent Saturday night. Upon entering I noticed the sign on the door stating that they now serve breakfast?! Wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast but it might be worth trying out. When we entered, we were seated immediately seeing there were only about 3 other occupied tables. We sat directly in front of the sushi maker. Our waitress opened our bottle of wine and we ordered. I was really in the mood for hibachi so I ordered the hibachi chicken which came with a shrimp appetizer, soup and salad. Hubs went with the sushi. Within what seemed like seconds, my shrimp appetizer and soup were served. The shrimp consisted of large tempura fried shrimp. No sauce with it and not deveined. No thanks. I passed to hubs who was also not interested. My salad then arrived. Not much to say here either. Typical iceberg, cabbage, carrot mix with ginger dressing. Before I could get halfway through my salad, my entree was served garnished with a huge radish rose the size of half a cantalope. Poor hubs had nothing at this point. My hibachi was typical. Fried rice was good, veggies are soft, chicken was tasty. Everything was very average for me at this point. When hubs sushi was finally served, half way through my meal, he also felt that it was average. Not the best he has had and not the worst. The most redeeming quality of the meal was the fried ice cream. The crisp, warm breading around the cold ice cream was a perfect match. Topped with chocolate sauce and whipped cream for the perfect treat. Remember going to the fair as a child and getting a funnel cake with ice cream on top? It was like that except with chocolate as well. Yum. All in all, I might head back to Pho Kim but will probably not get the hibachi again.",

We love to get the dinners which include full courses:  soup, salad (their ginger dressing should be bottled and sold en masse), tempura shrimp, main course, and dessert.  It's so much food, but sooo good.  I love the Chicken Teriyaki, myself.  The two of us get out, with tip, just under $50, but that's for the dinners.  If you went with one of the standard meals or specials, you'd spend quite a bit less.  They also have sushi, though we haven't been able to force ourselves away from our favorites long enough to try something new yet.",

We ordered fresh spring rolls , unfortunately they didn't taste the same, they came out with lettuce in them instead of Basil. My wife ordered pho the first time it was great, the second time not so much, it was dark and had no taste. I ordered something different , which I thought was a salad and I'm still not sure what it was except it was over powered but bean sprouts. My son ate here for the first time and was happy with most of his dinner box, but wasn't sure he would come back. 3-5 stars for Pho Kim 88 is what I give.",

Trust me, they don't skimp on the noodles! Both broths we seasoned well. My husbands kimchi broth was by far the best. A good combination of heat and spice.

Not sure what they did to it but it also smelled pretty bad. I didn't like it at all. The only reason I'm giving it an extra star is because they gave us two free mochis icecream at the end which was a nice treat. I think that they give you the icecream instead of fortune cookies.

    "text": "Whew.  And I mean, whew.  My friend and I headed to Pho Kim on Saturday night. I'd always wanted to try it as its right by my house and I've heard great things, but hadn't for the first two years of living nearby.   I was not missing a thing.  When we arrived, the place was packed, which was unexpected since we both though it would be kind of a dive. Not so: the interior was nicely decorated and we got more excited for the meal. Our server was very nice and the food was brought out quickly. If only the quality of the food was anywhere near the service, we would be grand. But no.  The pork spring rolls were ok-not very flavorful, and the meat was kind of mushy. My friend got a side salad with her meal, and I thought the ginger dressing was delicious! Thankfully, she ordered a big entree and gave me her salad. That and the spring rolls were the only things I could get down.   The first downturn: she got her soup. I honestly forget the kind of soup because as soon as she sipped it she wrinkled her nose and held up a spoonful of it to me.   \"Smell this.\"  I did. \"Does this smell like wet dog to you?\"  And yeah, it did. Exactly like wet dog.  \"Thankfully it doesn't taste like wet dog,\" she said, which was probably just  kind of her, knowing that I had ordered Pho.  I ordered the Pho Tai (rare beef) and it looked delicious when it arrived, with fixings--greens and sprouts--on the side. I picked up my spoon and sipped the broth, my excitement vanishing quickly. I glanced over at my friend.  \"Wet dog?\"  Yup. Again, it smelled exactly like wet dog. I switched to the noodles, hoping the smell wouldn't be overpowering. Nope. Still bad. I legitimately plugged my nose as I took a sip of the broth.  Off the look of disgust on my face, she asked : \"does it taste like wet dog?\" I responded that I didn't know, but it did taste like the bathroom air after giving Molly (you guessed it, my dog) a bath.     \"Then it tastes like wet dog, my friend.\"  After that conclusion, I made no more attempts at eating the meal. I did sniff the broth a couple more times, hoping in vain that the smell had gone away. It had not.  Now look, I'm not saying I was actually served dog as the meat in my meal. That's a crappy and disturbing stereotype that's thrown around at Asian restaurants far too often. What I am saying is that, regardless of what meal I ordered, it should not have tasted or smelled like my dog's bath time.  My friend's hibachi arrived somewhere in this dog smell saga, and while it all tasted fine, it was lukewarm at best. Fried rice? Cold. Shrimp? Cold. Steak? Cold.  Our server did apparently think it was one of our birthday's, since we were given a free mochi desert, so that was weird but nice.   I'd love to give an extra star for the service but I don't think that's a fair rating for a restaurant I will never go back to.",

My favorite part was the Pad Thai - It was unlike anything I have ever had before.  It's not all sauce, peanuts and standard noodles like every other place.  I ordered it with tofu and it was AWESOME - the noodles in their Pad Thai are really wide and taste homemade.  They kind of stick together and are just so delicious.    Pad Thai gets a bad rap, snobby folks tend to think of it as ordering sweet and sour chicken - but Pho Kim 88's version is amazing and probably a lot different than what you are used to.",

It's so 90's it hurts, but feels good man. If you're big into 90's stuff you should honestly come here to see it, it's a relic.  The food in general falls pretty flat. The menu is massive and they have so much on it, it's scary. I didn't try the sushi because I looked around at the restaurant and I did not trust that they would serve safe sushi. Also, most of their sushi recipes are really not even remotely Asian. Kind of grossed me out.  All in all, I think it's better to avoid this place. There must be better pho in town.",

Taste was wonderful second bowl was bland. The meat over cooked and the noodles were mushy.

They brought out a plate with fresh jalapenos, limes, basil, and sprouts. They also brought a bottle of Siracha and a bottle of Hoison sauce. Pho Kim is the only place that brings you Hoison sauce with Pho. The soup itself is in a huge bowl. It had lots of rice noodles, green onions, and shredded chicken in a very flavorful broth. I added everything to the soup except for the jalapenos. Then I added some Hoison sauce. It was a bowl of goodness. One of my sons got Chicken and Broccoli. I had a small taste and it was very good. It wasn't a typical bland brown sauce. I liked it so much I may order it on my next visit. My other son had Lovers Lo Mein. It was also good but needed more sauce.  The service was a bit lacking. Our water was never refilled. In fact our server came back after our food was served. We had to flag her down to get more water and to get our check.  Despite the less than desirable service I would recommend this place to friends.",

The amount and quality of food that you get here for the price really can't be beat.  They now offer Hibachi Boats which are, quite literally, a BOATLOAD of food.  Soup, salad, hibachi chicken, steak, or shrimp, 2 pieces tuna sashimi, 2 pieces salmon sashimi, 4 pieces shrimp tempura, 4 pieces California roll, and edamame... for $16.  Yep, you read that right.  SIXTEEN. DOLLARS. for all that food!!  It's a freakin' steal if you do the math off of the menu (the sashimi alone would run you $10).  You get a little bit of everything so it's perfect if you can't make up your mind between sushi and hibachi!    My SO selected the shrimp boat and was thoroughly pleased with his choice.  I ordered Lucky Buddha #1 which is soup, salad, a Cali roll, and (our favorite) a Royce Roll.  $15.  Again, what a deal!   We had so much food, took some home, and the bill was only $33.  The staff is so nice, there are plenty of TVs to keep you occupied, and their onion/Pho Kim soup is the best I've ever had. It actually has flavor to it, which can't be said for so many other restaurants.  I look forward to many more meals here at Pho Kim and highly recommend you get there yourself!",

It was called Bun Bo Hue, spicy seafood broth with delicious noodles. This was all I needed for lunch! Literally heaven in the mouth! The herbs and peppers on the side were nice and fresh and crisp, plus broth was spicy and yet not overwhelming and full flavor. The seafood was cooked perfectly so there was no concerns of any food borne illnesses. Finally the noodles were not mushy and soft but very well done.

Pho Kim 88 does not disappoint. Not only do they serve Vietnamese cuisine but other oriental yum yums as well like Japan and Thailand. The dumplings are delicious, their Popping Boba Tea takes about 15 minutes to make so call ahead if it's for pick up, the Thai Tom Kha (spicy coconut milk seafood soup) is too amazing for words, both the fresh and fried spring rolls do not disappoint, their rolls although pricey are delicious, and the Pho tastes similar to my hometown's which I accept.   I cannot give this place 5 stars though for the service. I don't mind the service with little to no smiles but when I did dine in our waitress was not quick to fill out our water no did she come to check on us for quite some time after the meal was delivered. It was not a busy lunch hour so I had to bump them a star.   Overall, I am happy to have a decent Vietnamese restaurant down the street from my work. I still need to try new places to get a better idea but Pho Kim 88 is just so convenient and good that I may never venture out. It's definitely worth it to give the place a try.",

    "text": "Absolutely disgusting.  The interior looked so dirty with chairs circa 1960.  The service was horrific.  We sat there for at least half an hour waiting for our server to get us our bill - she was behind the sushi counter making sushi.  I asked for spicy pad Thai and it wasn't even remotely spicy and made with huge noodles that tasted like gelatinous mush.  Maybe they should concentrate on one type of food rather than make Vietnamese , Japanese , Thai and Chinese because of the four meals and two appetizers we bought nothing was good.  Steer clear unless you like eating in a dirty place with gross food and horrible service",

As I know, they speak Cantonese, they could be Chinese-Vietnamese. When me and my friends go there, we usually order Vietnamese noodle soup (huge portion) their spring rolls, and fried tofu which are DELICIOUS!! However, the soup base is just too salty for us, we always tell the waitress to make ours less salty.   Service wise, I have to give them one star. The lady with short hair is so rude most of the time. If you happen to have her serving you...oh it's your lucky day then.",

    "text": "Have been seeing Pho soup pop up an Andrew Zimmeran's shows and finally decided to go to get some.  The place was cozy, perfect for a date, not too loud, not too busy and the server came over right away.  I don't have a problem telling someone if I don't have experience and today wasn't any different.  The server suggested the basic noodle bowl so we ordered that and another of my new interests- a bento box.   The good- the bento box contained a California roll which was nice & fresh, perfectly rolled and rather full.  It was delicious.  The chicken on a stick was teriyaki and perfect as well.  The steak cubes were marinated and cooked perfect but a bit tough to chew (so I wouldn't blame them).  The rest of the ingredients were rather good but not so good as to make them memorable.      The bad- my taste for lemongrass.  If you aren't familiar- I looked it up for you...  Lemongrass: Related to citronella, this bulbous, greyish green tropical grass is a favored herb in Southeast Asian cuisines, where its delicate, lemony essence permeates a wide assortment of dishes. In Thai cooking, lemongrass is used most frequently to flavor soups, salads and curries. Had I looked it up first, seeing that the first thing it says is 'related to citronella...' I should have ordered something else.  Lemongrass is STRONG.  I can't say it tastes like anything I have ever tasted before and now I know I'm not a fan.  But if you are, this bowl was stuffed with noodles, vegetables, came with a side of fresh jalapenos (at my request, as I told the server we liked spicy) and some dry rice noodle crackers.  Again- if you like lemongrass- this soup would have been perfect.  I wanted to like it, but I just can't.  Again- nothing against the restaurant, just the flavor of lemongrass...  See where I'm going here?   Thanks for reading.  :)",

I have been to countless Vietnamese and Thai restaurants and never have I had such lousy service. I am not one to leave bad reviews but the staff treat you like a number.  To add to that, their Pad Thai is very poor. They use drunken noodles for the noodles and if you are familiar with Thai food, you know that thin noodles are used for Pad Thai --- not large wide noodles. This in itself ruined the meal for me.

We were one of the first ones in the restaurant for dinner and the place was pretty quiet. Our waiter was pleasant and quick to serve us. Upon opening the menu, I was surprised at the amount of options there were including Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai. My friend and I decided to split two entrees, Chicken Fried Rice and General Tsos Chicken with sticky rice. The General Tsos was absolutely amazing! By far the best I have ever had. The sauce had just enough tang, the broccoli was tender, and the chicken was plump and juicy. As for the fried rice, it was not bad but could have used a little more flavor. It was served with a sauce that may have been intended to be the solution, however I was not a fan of it.   By the end of our time together, my friend and I had half of each dish left and were able to split it to take home. Our waiter kindly took the dishes and boxed the entrees for us. By the time we were leaving, the place was filling up for dinner. Little did we know that it was a BYOB establishment - noted for the future!   I intend to take my husband here in the future to give it a try!",

Sometimes when this is the case it's too much but from what I tasted today they seem to have it down pretty well. First I got their banana bubble tea. Yum! It had the boba balls in it and was so good! It actually tasted like real banana, not artificial. I got the Asian wedding soup to start, it was good and just what I needed to warm up. For my meal I ordered two sushi rolls- a special roll, I forget now exactly what it was called but it was the spicy one, as well as spicy tuna roll. It tasted fresh and I ate it all very quickly! My mom enjoyed her food as well! I got my boyfriend General tsos to go and I snuck a piece! Huge pieces of chicken! Cooked really well! I will definitely be back to try more from this place!",

I'm still partial to Tan Lac Vien in Squirrel Hill but this restaurant is owned by a family member so it's super similar and equally delicious. The staff is always so friendly and welcoming which is always a bonus. Pho Kim 88 offers sushi, Thai, and popular Chinese dishes too - a nice diverse menu so even the picky eaters can find something.   When I'm sick or under the weather I always get the pho. It magical and with a doubt shortens my colds. The pho broth is flavorful and hearty without being overly salty or concentrated but my go to when not sick is the Bun Vermicelli with pork and a pot of ginger tea. I could have this 5 days a week!",

There are many better Pho restaurants in the city, but unfortunately, Pho Kim is the only one in the South Hills.   Many people say the sushi is really good here. The hubby got the Rolls Royce and a California roll (the sushi special #1) and they left a lot to be desired. Didn't taste fresh to me. I expected the Pho to be the star of the show and while it was better than the sushi, the soup was just alright. The broth lacked depth of flavor and was a bit on the salty side.   I was really hoping this would be a good place for me to go to satisfy pho hankerings as it's right down the street from me. Unfortunately, I won't be stopping here when a pho craving hits.",

At one point I was considering just having the waitress just dump my food into a wood chipper and shooting it over towards my mouth.  I know some of you haters are gonna say its not the greatest, but it's a pretty good deal for the quantity and it is also pretty good quality.  The sushi ain't half bad either.  It also helps that it is about 50 feet from where I live.  Definitely worth a try if you haven't been.",

They just created new rolls on the menu...each time we go back,  I try a new one.  We have never been disappointed with their sushi.   CHICKEN FRIED RICE and the Chicken PAD THAI are amazing!  Our favorite dinner is the HIBACHI steak dinner. Prices are reasonable and they have generous portions on these meals.  The lunch version is just as good, just smaller portions and no soup or shrimp appetizer. The Seafood Diablo is also extremely good...spicey too. I also like their wonton soup. Their ginger dressing for their salad is light and tasty.   If you like fresh spring rolls in peanut dipping sauce, theirs are delicious. They also have a vietnamese rice noodle dish with peanut, basil - also excellent.  They recently remodeled and created new additional seating.  It is very nice.  The staff are very friendly.  The restrooms are clean and nice.  The owner is usually around too and very pleasant man.  Tip:  order vietnamese items on menu OR items above.   Tip: beware Chinese items (general tso) - it's done differently than traditional Chinese restaurants.  Tip: lunch has large portions too and cheaper menu  If you are in the neighborhood, give them a try.",

It's not the absolute BEST, but it's tasty and the portion size is well worth the money.   I kind of feel like they went the way that most Asian restaurants do in that they tailor the flavor of the food they serve to appeal to the American palate.  The fish sauce they serve with the Pho is not very strong, and the soy sauce is your standard Kikkoman (this drives me crazy.  Kikkoman is probably the worst soy sauce on the market). For a REAL treat try the Pad Thai.   It's honestly the best Pad Thai I have ever had on the East coast, AND it's made with real pad noodles!  Ample parking, BYOB and friendly staff.",

I searched for \"pho\" thinking that a nice hot bowl of noodle soup would hit the spot after spending a few hours in a cold ice rink.  We were not disappointed when we arrived at Pho Kim 88.  My husband had the fresh spring rolls, which accurately described them.  Nice sweet shrimp, crunchy vegetables, and a delicious peanut sauce were the perfect combination for a delicious appetizer.  I had the steamed edamame which were nice and salty and perfectly cooked.  I had also decided on a pot of ginger tea, the hot ginger filled liquid instantly warming me up.  I ordered the rare beef pho, and it was one of the best I've ever had. The broth was excellent, all flavors melding nicely, not one overpowering the other.  The condiments of basil, bean sprouts, lime, and jalapeno were perfectly fresh. I ate the entire bowl which was huge! My husband got the miso soup and said it was delicious. I took his word for it and didn't taste it, as I'm not a fan of miso. Even though I was stuffed at this point,  I also got a to-go coconut Boba tea because it's one of those things I can't get where I live and I love it.  The coconut flavor was good, but the usual tapioca I am used to was more like mango flavored poppers instead of chewy tapioca.   It wasn't bad, and I did drink it all, but I prefer the large chewy flavorless tapioca pearls.  The atmosphere was very comfortable and clean and the waitstaff very friendly and attentive.   If I lived here I would eat here several times a month!",

This shows you the extra time, money and attention to detail that this restaurant invests in its patrons! Service is usually very good. The crab rangoons are absolutely amazing! I also enjoy their fresh spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce, although some less adventurous customers may be turned off by the transparency of the fresh roll's exterior. The Thai bubble tea was wonderful- very refreshing. No matter what sushi you order, it is wonderful and the presentation is outstanding. I ordered the Chicken Curry dish, which was very good! The ambiance of the place is nice with asian art and plants, an exotic fish tank and is dimly lit. The restaurant is not very big and has many tables, so on a busy night, one may feel slightly cramped or overwhelmed by the patrons voices carrying in the smaller room, but overall it is not too distracting. The quality of the food is really what makes this restaurant a favorite in my book, not to mention, the owner let my father and I in before they opened just to ensure quality customer satisfaction! This is a place that gives you ambiance, good service, phenomenal eats, and overall great feeling upon leaving!",

    "text": "In short: Pho is mediocre.  Coffee is EXPENSIVE.  Confused and disappointed with experience.  In Detail:   I ordered a bowl of pho and the vegetables that came along with it included herb, bean sprout, and what should have been fresh lime wedges, were already squeezed and used lime wedges. WTF!!!! Kind of irritated me that a 13 dollar bowl of pho couldn't be packaged with fresh lime wedges.  Anyways, I don't complain at restaurants while eating for fear of retaliation in mystery ingredients.  I just don't go back.    Here is the other kicker to my experience. Before the menu was even given, the old lady waitress asked if I wanted Vietnamese Iced Coffee. \"Sure,\" I said.  She was excited and rushed off to make the coffee I guess and came back quickly.  Well when I started drinking the Vietnamese Coffee, I started to look at the menu.  I almost choked on the coffee.  It was 5 dollars!!!  What kind of specialty coffee is 5 dollars. This ain't no Starbucks Frappuccino with edible gold speckles.  I have eaten at tons of Vietnamese establishments in DC, NYC, Cali.  I have accepted Pho in Pittsburgh is way overpriced. But coffee....seriously....I have never seen Vietnamese Iced Coffee priced at 5 bucks.  From this place it tasted like powdered coffee in ice anyways.  Not Good.  Arrrgggghhhh???  That old lady........   This is sadly the first and last time I will be at Pho Kim 88.  Best wishes to all future patrons.",

I got the pho gai with tofu, they were happy to accommodate a change, and the broth was delicious, the veggies were all fresh and the tofu was perfect.  The prices were very reasonable and the service was great.  Note: they do not have a kids menu, so I brought outside food for my 3 year old and they had no problem with it at all.  I'm excited to eat there again, especially since I heard their hibachi is great!  Plus we live right behind the restaurant so I can't wait to go again next week!!",

    "text": "I wanted to get away from anything, and everything St. Patrick's Day, and was in the mood for something Asian. I made the escape from the family, and found myself at Pho Kim, I just wasn't sure what I'd be ordering this time.  I went for the squid salad as an appetizer, and ordered the Seafood Diablo after some suggestions, since I've had everything else in most of the columns on the menu. The squid salad came with sliced up squid, seaweed, lettuce, and cucumber strips. I was hoping for actual chunks of squid, with legs, and tentacles, but was happy with the taste of the salad. The squid was the only ingredient seasoned, and the rest of the salad a bit bland.  The Seafood Diablo came out on a huge platter, with a generous portion of steamed rice (enough for two). I was given a choice of veggie fried rice, or noodles as the side, but since chewy udon noodles came mixed in the dish, I chose steamed rice. The udon was perfectly cooked, chewy, and mixed nicely with the scallops, shrimp, and mixed vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and onions). I'm not sure the base of the sauce, but it was good, not as spicy as I'd like. The Seafood Diablo came with a small side salad with a miso(?) dressing, and a small side soup. All this food in front of me made me feel like I was in some kind of chow competition. Food, and dishes spanning my table, and the fresh spring rolls that I always order, had to go home in a to-go box.",

The staff is always friendly and helpful and they remember who you are, they really do love their customers. It's BYOB and clean.

I also ordered the Fried Calamari Salad....disappointing not only in presentation, but also in taste.  It was GIANT tubes of calamari deep fried and thrown on a bed of lettuce.  The knife given to me was not sharp enough to cut them.  So I had to pick up the huge chunks and bite off pieces. The batter on the interior of the squid was uncooked....pretty gross.  I don't understand the concept of this?  why not cut it before frying it so that you can actually eat it with the salad?  Even my beloved Bun Bo Hue seems to have changed in the flavor profile.  I'm pretty upset about this.  I used to love coming here, but it seems as if they got a new cook or the old cook has a lost any inspiration they once had.",

Unfortunately, the last 3 times I have visited the restaurant and/or gotten takeout these was an issue with something.

We ordered the steak roll and it came out wrong didn't have half the stuff it claimed to have on the menu in it, we informed the waiter who sent the owner over she acted very unprofessional and said that she would just take it away, and wouldn't even let me explain what was wrong with it while comparing it to the menu she just kept cutting me off and then walked away.  The best part is we had a groupon that we showed the waiter before we even sat down who said that we could use this coupon right off the phone and no need to print it.  When our meal we over the we go to use the groupon and the owner litterely started arguing with my wife in front of customers about how it needs to be printed and did not care what the waiter said.  Needless to say I told her that she has terrible customer service, and John the old owner should have never sold his business to her, mark my worss she will run this place into the dirt.  We use to be regulars once a week and will never be returning to this place, I will also spread the word to friends and family so they don't return.  John or Kim if you still read these, its a shame you let this woman run a business with Kim's name it, she is a disgrace to a business that you built and made so wonderful!!!!",
