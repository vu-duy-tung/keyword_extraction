I've had omelets, pancakes, waffles, ham-and-eggs, BLTs and a couple other items and have not been disappointed.  Home fries are fresh and you can get them with peppers and onions for an extra $1,  but the hashbrowns are McDonald's style. They have specials that aren't run-of-the-mill, such as thick-sliced cinnamon toast with a sweet sauce that was more yummy than I thought it would be. As you might expect in a place like this in Pittsburgh, you'll get a full plate of food.  A frequent special is \"ham off the bone\" which is a generous serving of carved baked ham with a couple eggs and your choice of potatoes. Great ham.   Friendly waitresses who keep the coffee mug full. Kitchen open for breakfast and lunch only but they stay open later selling lottery tickets.",

I've has those several times. Everything here is quite good, and even the coffee is tasty. I particularly like their funky mugs with old advertisements on them.   My mom lives half a mile from here, and before I graduated from college it was our tradition to come get breakfast on the last day of my holiday before I flew back to Chicago. The staff has always been very friendly to us and goes out of their way to make allowances for her wheat allergy. They are a large part of why Cole Cafe has a much nicer atmosphere than some of the diners closer to me in the city. I know I'll be coming back here on occasion as long as my mom lives in the north hills. It's worth the trip!",

Katie, the waitress, told us they were bumping up our order to the front and it shouldn't be that long.  After seeing four other tables get their food before us, I told Katie we were about to leave.  Two more tables got their food before we finally got ours.   Total wait time was 45 minutes!  My scrambled eggs were so over cooked they were inedible.  My husband got his toast after he finished his breakfast. No apology from the owner.  Katie told us we wouldn't have to pay for our meal. I told her I had no intention of paying for it anyway. She never checked on our breakfast or asked the kitchen staff where our food was.  We will never go back.",

Anyway, my husband and I went here for a late breakfast after our afternoon plans fell through. It was your typical local diner, with old mismatched seating, reasonable prices, and friendly service.   My husband ordered breakfast. He got eggs, chorizo, and potatoes. The chorizo looked homemade. You could tell the patties were handshaped and weren't pre-made frozen ones.   I ordered a Pittsburgh Salad which is a common choice for me. I got the BBQ chicken on my salad and I liked that the BBQ sauce and Ranch dressing were both served on the side. It was also a nice portion size for the price.   The server we had was very friendly and talked to us about the new iPhone operating system and how he also likes to drink coffee with a straw as my husband does. It's nice to see servers who are able to partake in casual conversation with customers.  I'd definitely go back again. It's a nice low-key place close to home where we can go for breakfast when we don't want to drive far or wait long.",

The standard french toast order is three pieces, and despite the warning about the portion size to my pint sized dining partner, we ordered the full serving.  The french toast was delicious, although a bit too much \"vanillaly\" as the youngster phrased her opinion.   The hash was great as well, not overly greasy, and hot with just enough crunch on the browned bits of meat and potatoes.  The eggs were standard fare, scrambled and needing salt. Our waitress was cheerful and kept the coffee cup full. Overall a pleasant experience, and will return to try one of the abundant omelet options.",

It's not just the fact they they used no salt or pepper (I understand that because of health concerns) but there was no herbs or spices at all. I believe in second chances so we, my husband and I, went again the following week. My husband and I ordered sandwiches. Egg salad which was sloppy with no flavor and the white bread was chewy. The grilled ham with cheese was not grilled but toasted in a toaster. The egg salad sandwich alone costs $4.50. I had to order fries separately. I will say that their fries are perfect but I can do that at home. I'm sorry but having a quaint setting, great waitress and good fries isn't enough. The food needs to be good and an egg salad sandwich should NOT cost more than a carton of eggs.",

She did say the cinnamon toast left a little to be desired as it was basically white bread with a \"touch\" of cinnamon. It may be ok for people who don't like sweet breads, but that ain't her.

I notice others leaving  Mmmm where is our food Waitress comes over in a totally void of emotion voice tells us she threw out our order... we ask ??? Apparently she threw out the page from her pad that she wrote our order on. Ok so we repeat our order  Long story long time 40 min later we said sorry we can't wait anymore  A flippant sorry from another waitress  And we are out the door never ever to return  Ps of course we left enough money on the table for the coffee and tea",

The waitress, Alyssa I think, was friendly and very efficient.  She kept my coffee refilled continuously which I thoroughly appreciated.  I ordered a short stack of pancakes, crispy home fries and crispy bacon. The order arrived quickly, hot, and aromatic! It was delicious. I highly recommend you stop in for breakfast.  You'll enjoy the homestyle and delicious food in a very friendly, cozy neighborhood atmosphere.",

    "text": "I have been to Coles over a dozen times maybe more since 2016. At first the breakfast menu items i selected were well above average in every category related to food. Cooked to expectations, nice portions, and an all around hearty breakfast destination. The past few visits however saw all the categories dropped dramatically. Today i had the Breakfast Combo; 2 pieces of italian bread french toast, 2 eggs scrambled, bacon and a side of home fries. What a disappointment!!! For starters the french toast looked liked it was dipped in egg and only slightly grilled. Bread was still white, wet and barely warm. Scrambled eggs bacon and home fries were on a separate plate. Eggs were over cooked and browned like the french toast was supposed to be cooked. Eggs looked like they were never scrambled once on the grill. Home fries barely cooked and cold while bacon was rare and again cold. I was only 1 of 6 patrons in the diner and all either were eating or had there food delivered at the time i placed my order so the experience was not due to alot of patron activity.   3 years ago i would rate the food much higher but it has declined in 3 short years to the point i will need to find another breakfast diner from now on.  Maybe in a couple of years i may recommend this diner for breakfast again but until improvements are made, i will travel the few extra miles to Millvale and Pamela's!",

    "text": "The first time I went to Cole Cafe I was not completely satisfied.  I think because I just didn't order the right thing.  I think I just got an omelet and wasn't impressed.  Seriously, I don't even remember.  There was probably bacon...?  I do remember thinking I should have gone with one of the signature breakfasts and regretting that I didn't.  So I vowed to return.  And return I did.  This time for the Carved Ham from the Bone (one of the signature breakfasts).  It came with eggs, home fries and toast.  I don't always go for ham, but this was some good ham.  The whole breakfast was reasonably priced (I think around $8) and service is always friendly (though sometimes during peak can be slow).  For me, Cole Cafe is ideally located for breakfast with the folks so there's a pretty good chance I'll be back again.",

The quality of the food is what you would expect to make at home (which is a good thing).  They seem to use real ingredients which is nice.  My only complaint is that the green peppers were a little under cooked and hard.  If you are in the area, I would recommend stopping in for a quick bite.",

It is a no frills, solid diner with some super staff members. One of the few places that has buckwheat pancakes so I had a pancake combo with 2 cakes, bacon and eggs. Eggs were solid and the bacon was cooked perfectly for me, not too crispy at all. Pancakes reminded me of a time when I would get them with my dad when I was a kid. Very tasty and the food is really a good price . Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed. Ps.... tasted the potato pancake and it was the bomb.",

    "text": "What a lovely cafe! I ended up here because I dropped my car off at ziebart a mile down the road and the owner suggested this place. It felt homey and cozy. I walked to the back, sat down, and immediately someone came up to me to ask what I wanted to drink. I got plain coffee.  I scanned the menu and the peanut butter chocolate chip pancakes caught my eye so quickly. I ordered two with powdered sugar. I know someone makes them, but they came quick and they were huge. I smelled the sweetness coming off the pancakes. The lady asked me if I wanted one or two small containers of syrup. I went with one though it's nice to offer that choice.  Holy moly these pancakes are sinfully delicious! They're fluffy and I could see the chocolate and peanut butter chips. Oh man, what a treat! I'm embarrassed to say I polished off both pancakes! Now I'm full and happy. I'm impressed with the friendly service, laid back homey atmosphere, and the amazing pancakes. I must come back!",

    "text": "It's been a few months since I've been to Cole Cafe, and I wasn't going to post anything, but then I saw that the Trib gave them the Gold Award for Best Hamburger.   When I went there a few months ago, I ordered a burger. It's about $5-6 dollars, with no sides included, and they up charge for EVERYTHING. Cheese is $1 (which is understandable), but even lettuce and tomato were an additional 25 cents each, and plain raw onions were an additional 75 cents. They didn't inform me about the lettuce and tomato charges, and I only saw it after getting my check at the end of the meal (onions were mentioned on the menu, but it's still ridiculous to charge for that).  The person I was with got an omelet and asked for Italian bread, and they charged him an additional 20 cents (once again, we were never informed about this, just saw it on the check).   I ordered a side of fries and they are unseasoned, plain frozen French fries you'd find in the grocery store.  I was given about 10-15 total.   But the worst part about this all was that they gave me this hamburger on a stale, old bun. I couldn't even bite into it.  I was so disgusted I can't ever go back there. It looks like this place has good reviews and maybe my experience was not typical, but I had to warn others about it.",
