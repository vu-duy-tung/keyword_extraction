My boyfriend tried ordering online but it didn't work so we did have to call it in, the only downfall of it all. We got the Tuscon chicken pizza and it was delicious. The chicken is real chicken breast and as for the vegetables and toppings you can taste the freshness with the first bite. I literally fell in love with this pizza as soon as I saw it. Fresh peppers, artichokes, parsley and chicken that falls apart when you try to pull it off. Mmmm, mouth watering. The wings were fine perfectly. Crispy and not slimy. We got mild buffalo and the Louisiana sauce. So impressed with this place, I can't wait to eat there again!!!",

Pizza is a common item, but these were uncommonly good. The dough was very good. Amount of topping was just right - not too much, not to little. Perhaps the best item are the folks that work there. Very polite, nice, and helpful. All in all, a great pizza and very good overall experience.",

The sauce is good but the crust is very plain and doesn't have much flavor.  I'm a big fan of good crust but theirs tasted very bland like frozen bread dough from the super market.  Prices were reasonable but not cheap.  Have to say the name and building are very appropriate for the pizza they make.  Guess I have to keep searching for great pizza in the North Hills but haven't found it yet.",

I had found Large Plain on yelp after learning that Monte Cello's does not deliver. After reading the reviews here, I placed my order for 4 Sicilian pizzas and set delivery up between 9:15/9:30pm. The young lady that answered my call was very polite and helpful. I ordered a chicken ranchero, meat lovers, cheese and pepperoni. They were delivered right on time at 9:30. This is the first time my lodge has had pizza from here (same as myself since I'm not from the North Hills) and wow, it was fantastic. Large Plain has a new set of customers!!!  I'm excited to try other things from their menu.",

But the part that upset me was the lady who took the order blamed it on us and even while the pizza was being redone, she was making sarcastic jokes as to how she doesn't eat pork.  They give us a large pizza when we asked for X large.  They remade the pizza for us after tantrums, but if you at the picture, they forget to put sausage on it and the pizza was undercooked for us to rebake it and the only thing I could taste was salt.

The star of Large Plain pizza is definitely the cheese - hence the name.  They almost force you into buying their large, plain pizza, which is great for the price (and tasty), but if you're like me and like a few meaty toppings on your pie, be careful as the cost really skyrockets.  They want about $2 per topping (and bacon counts as a *double* topping) so I feel like I'm being gouged for being a T-Rex, in a way.    Still, it's phenomenal pizza.  Just expect to part with about $20 if you want more than one topping on it.",

After taking my order I was told that it would be about 15-20 minutes before it was ready.  I arrived at the restaurant just over 25 minutes later and the pizza was ready.  The inside of Large Plain wasn't much to look at as there was a counter and a few picnic tables inside with a few more picnic tables outside.  The whole process of picking up the pizza took maybe 2 minutes which was impressive especially since the employee was friendly to me.    Large Plain's pizza is a medium thickness crust pizza although it is on the thinner side of that thickness.  That allowed for the crust to be somewhat crispy which is something that I love in pizza.  It had a good ratio of cheese to sauce which made eating it easy but I didn't think that there was anything special about either ingredient.  In the end it was a solid pizza that was A-OK.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  Yes the service was nice and the pizza was ok but there are plenty of better pizza places in the area that I would be more likely to head to first.",

    "text": "A great find and they deliver to our new house!   The phone call in to order was painless and quick and the pizza arrived promptly. The price is great for the quality of the pizza.   The pizza was exactly what we were hoping for. A nice crust that was doughy without being undercooked. The part that makes or breaks a pizza for me is where the crust meets the cheese line. Large Plain puts cheese all the way up to crust without the gross sauce-only portion.   We will definitely make this a go to pizza shop!",

The pizza, if ordered with sausage, comes with the small crumbled sausage which is hard to find and so good! I have to stop myself from ordering here so much.. Definitely worth every penny.",

    "text": "This by far is my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. By chance I found it while in McKnight rd and wanted to try a new pizza place. Its awesome. It seems like it's fairly new but that doesn't make it taste any less amazing. I think I've met the owner or at least the main cook she was so nice!! My second time there she Gave me coupons and extra 6 wings. I mean how nice was that!! She was so nice and friendly. We talked while I was paying and she seemed very down to earth and just a nice person. They definitely have a great thing going on there. Its clean! Easy to get too. The prices are really good. I got a xl for less than 15$. I tried their wings and they were really good too. If you like hot wings their definitely worth getting. Their pizza is not overly greasy, just enough sauce and cheese. I've only had pepperoni pizza but thats definitely good enough. Its not like you HAVE TO have a bunch of toppings. I would like to try some other toppings though just to see what it's like. If your in the area definitely try it!! It says  limited delivery so im I'm not sure where they go to. I've always picked up.",

    "text": "Hands down the best pizza in the North Hills. Discernible fresh ingredients and an exceptional crust that they brush with garlic butter before going into the oven.   The service can be touch and go at times, but their product speaks for itself and they deserve the 5 I gave them.",

    "text": "I passed Large Plain numerous times before finally trying it. After all, it's a memorable name but having the word Plain in the title isn't encouraging to the passer by. While the Spinach and Chicken pizza has become my favorite and I tend to stick to it, my housemate has tried a variety of orders and is pleased each time. Large Plain is a good, reliable pizza place - a much better option than the national chains for price, delivery times, and flavor. My only critique is one I have of many delivery joints: there is a good chance they will forget your drink order so order cautiously. One lucky time he had just forgotten them in the car, but the delivery man has show up more than a couple of times without the beverages. Remember what you ordered when he shows up and check your food before he goes.",
