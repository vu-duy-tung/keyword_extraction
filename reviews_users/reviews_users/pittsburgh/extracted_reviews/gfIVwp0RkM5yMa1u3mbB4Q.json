Claiming if we didn't have paperwork we would not be allowed in the store. As we were getting the documentation that my friend needed the animal for her panic attacks the woman said that we would need to wait outside while we did that. This place is discriminatory against people with disabilities and so we took our money and our ESA down the street to Piories Fine Pasties.

I usually have no idea how long the bag has been in when I order tea. For those who are not into hot tea, they have a wide selection of iced teas, as well as coffee too.

It was rather large and very inviting. I was greeted by the cashier and, after learning it was my first visit, she made some recommendations. Since I've been drinking hot tea for a few months now, I decided to go with their iced peach apple cobbler tea. My drink arrived with a few dashes of cinnamon on top. It was very, very good! I was surprised by the strength of the flavors since it can be hit or miss with some teas. This had the flavor of your granny's church cobbler and while it's unsweetened, the cinnamon lent a nice sweet flavor to it.   This would be a great place to have a meeting,  map out a project or just chill. Chill was my goal today....mission accomplished. Very nice place with friendly and engaging service. I shall return.",

There is a couch/coffee table in front of a fireplace and larger table in the back. Free wifi.   This review is mostly for Arnold's atmosphere, since I was here to do some work. This place just opened, so it was not crowded at all. A great thing for me, but I'm sure they will get busier one word gets out. Shhh!   I almost had the whole place to myself! For now, the non-busy and spacious feel of Arnold's Tea is what makes this establishment special. That and the soft smooth jazz (I love me some sultry sax and laidback jams) playing in the background. Exactly what I needed.  DRINKS I had the \"Arnold on the green\" which was green tea and lemonade. I liked how light and refreshing it was. Not too sweet and exactly how I imagined it would taste like. They also have a selection of sandwiches and pastries. On the back wall is a shelf of jars with tea leaves where you could buy tea leaves that ranged from your typical ones to the more exotic.  IMPRESSIONS I would come back to study and do work here. Again, the big open space and jazz music sealed the deal for me. You would never see me studying at Starbucks, Crazy Mocha, or the other chains because they are the complete opposite--crowded and noisy. Instead of sophisticated jazz, I hear unsophisticated gossip and obnoxious laughter. On repeat. Worst playlist ever.   Arnold's is the antithesis, and a small business. I respect that. Despite my desire to keep this place hush hush, so I can have this place to myself again, I encourage you to check it out if you need a place to lounge and get some work done.",

The first time I had a peach apple cobbler iced tea, and a few months later I returned to try a vanilla black tea latte.  The first time I also tried a brownie, which was large and filling.  However, I have never tried any of the sandwiches or other lunch food, and I'm not sure if I will... they seem a little expensive for what they are.  But it's worth a trip out just for the tea and the atmosphere.  Despite how open the space is, it still manages to have a cozy feeling, and the service is friendly.",

I enjoy the food here just as much, though! The selection and pricing is sort of like a Panera, but local and better. The pear arugula salad is my go-to.   The baristas/servers are very friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating.  I'm not sure if this cafe is conducive to going there to read or work, however. It can get a bit loud during the busy hours, and I think finding an outlet for a laptop would be a challenge.",

I feel like as a first time customer, for not a very busy time of day, I wasn't given the best customer service. I was confused as to which line to be in and what was coming to my seat and what I had to get at the calendar. Nobody was really helping and when I asked I kind of got a snippy comment in regards to not being at my table or something and then i ended up standing and waiting for a good few minutes, meanwhile I'm trying to juggle my three year old. so I left still not understanding a simple pick up food concept. I'll try it again there because I did like the options but I hope for friendlier staff next time.",

But my question is, who is Arnold and why did he want to show Pittsburgh that he could build a tea house? Did he actually like tea that well? Did he decide that other people liked tea that well? Was it some experiment to see how well he could excel in a venture like this? It seems like it will always be a mystery to me. He wasn't even there when I was there. It was just two ladies working. Which brings me to some new questions. Who were they and why were they so dedicated to making me my rooibos iced tea?    I will never know the answers to Arnold's secrets. What I Do know is that he created a very nice environment in which to relax or work while enjoying the tea he is offering. Also he created a very nice selection of tea to enjoy while sitting on a massive leather couch in his wood-laden parlor. I see a bright future for the North Side and it looks a lot like Arnold's Tea.",

There are many teas to choose from and they also offer a good menu. The space is very big a nice place to come and study or do work. My sister wanted to rent it for her bridal shower and they offer that. The only thing I would say is they should give an explanation of the different types of teas maybe in a smaller brochure. My sister who works at teavana said they used a lot of tea than is needed so they could save more money by using less. They also had honey and other items from local businesses. Other wise the service was great. It did take a long time to get my order but it was busy I won't knock them for that ;-)",

The menu is pretty large with lots of sandwiches and baked goods.   I had an iced caramel tea latte, which was delicious. My husband had a chocolate chai with almond milk and a PB&C sandwich, which he loved. And my sister had an Arnold on the Green that she said was very good.  It is worth the trip to support a small business, but also because the tea is just lovely! It also worth the (short) wait for the tea to steep, because it gives you a few minutes to enjoy the relaxing setting. :)",

    "text": "I was a regular patron here for the last two years or so, whenever they opened. I enjoyed the teas and the sandwiches even tho ordering usually was more difficult and time consuming than it should have been.   Most recently however, I ordered a Matcha--it has a little red asteric that denotes it is a \"master tea\". ~Nothing on the board (that takes up About 6ftx6ft) says that master teas are priced differently or cost more than all the other blends or speciality drinks.~ So when I look at the total on the register and it's higher than what the board said, I asked why it was $4.50 as opposed to $4.25, sure it's only a quarter, but it's also the difference in sizes also.   I immediately received backlash from the man at the counter, saying that \"match is different so it's more\". The man must have said this like 5 times as he grew more upset. He told me \"it has a asteric, that means it's a different price, we can't put all the prices up on the board bc it's too much info\", to which I replied \"the asteric denotes it's a master tea, but doesn't say its subject to different pricing.\" He stayed on his high horse, telling me \"it's matcha, it's different\" mixed with \"it's not gonna change, it's 4.50, it's special\".  then the lady who owns the place ( I think) comes up to the front and accuses me of ASKING ABOUT THE PRICE OF THE MATCHA BEFORE AND CAUSING A SCENE. To which I replied that I don't usually drink Matcha and was getting it for a friend, and it wasn't me...but if multiple people are questioning your prices THAT ARE NOT ADVERTISED PROPERLY, it's probably time to post the correct prices, bc it's False advertisement to charge more for something than you have advertised.   I was baffled at this customer service and feeling like I was being publicly shamed for inquiring about a price...   They are screaming at me at this point and I'm ready to leave, and the man looks at me and says \"you are NEVER allowed to be served here again!!\"  I've been frequenting this place for years! I can't believe the treatment I received for questioning a price and then was publicly humiliated when they were in the wrong in the first place. Mind blowing and they banned one customer and lost at least two more regular customers--and it's a shame, because we are only 2 blocks away and I'm a tea head and I need tea!!!",

I am a chai tea drinker - and was happy to find all kinds of flavors - vanilla, masala, chocolate...and a few others.  I went with vanilla (and was happy to find it was decaf!).  it was phenomenal!   I don't typically drink every ounce, but i couldn't wait to drink every ounce, it was so good!  The space has free wifi to use that worked beautifully.  The staff is friendly and helpful.

Not once did I feel like I needed to add sugar. I had no idea how I was going to top peach cobbler tea but to my surprise they did. I got a sandwich and when I said \"no bacon\" they informed me that they have turkey bacon. This is no ordinary turkey bacon either. It's thick and it has a crunch that I've never had with turkey bacon. I need to know the sorcery behind the bacon because it was pretty life changing and changed the dynamic of this sandwich. Last but not least, the staff was so nice and knowledgeable of the menu. Great food, tea, and customer service isn't something you can fake so they've completely earned this five star review.",

They have a bunch of different options of loose leaf tea available, and they of course offer hot and iced teas.   We got the blood orange tea lemonade as well as a peach apple coddler iced tea. THEY WERE SO GOOD!! I definitely recommend the peach and apple coddler, I'm probably coming back just to get this one again.   The decor inside is very nice, and they even had a little game of tic tac toe you can play. It's really cute!  Definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "I decided to check this place out since it has been a while since I've been on the North-side. There is street parking along with a parking lot on a diagonol behind it. All parking is metered wherever you park.  Came inside. The atmosphere was \"homey\" with wooden tables and chairs. In an adjacent room there is a sofa and table to relax. The place wasn't at all busy for lunch so I decided to order the pear arugula salad. I asked the counter person regarding getting a cold tea since it was an unusually warm day. She told me that all of their teas can be made cold upon request. There was one that interested me which was called \"Peach apple cobbler tea.\" I asked about it and was told  that it has that flavor to it along with cider mixed in. Seeing fall had arrived I opted for that one.  She also explained to me that my salad would come with bacon, pecans, and Gorgonzola cheese which I said was fine. The dressing used is a pear vinaigrette that also contains the same cheese. I went to sit down to wait for my order and observed that they have takeout, a wall full of various teas and huge desserts or pastries available for purchase.  Finally she explained that they have a reward program via Perka where if you purchase a total of 6 teas then your 7th one would be free. This is a good reward program for anyone who frequents the place.  I got my salad and it was indeed delicious! I had ordered the large size of the cobbler tea and found it just as good with enough cider in it that I didn't need any added sugar. They also specialize in peach lemonades for cold drinks and have a great assortment. The salad was served on a regular dish along with an actual fork and knife on a tray. Once finished there is an area where you can throw away your trash and place the tray and utensil as well as the dish in a separate area.  Prices are reasonable whether you are ordering a salad, sandwich, or pastry to go with your tea of choice. This place is another neighborhood gem. It sits close to Allegheny General hospital on East Ohio St so it is best to come in the off hours. Am looking forward to my next visit to try a hot tea and perhaps one of their pastries.",

    "text": "I'm so happy this place exists. It's exactly what I want for the North Side (and a little jealous it's not what we have in my neighborhood, Dormont). An inviting coffee shop with plenty of seating, and best of all fantastic food and drinks.   While it's not a full bakery (they have cookies and scones), they do have a ton of really fantastic sandwiches and salads, made to order. I'm absolutely OBSESSED with the pear and chicken salad, that's mixed with fresh arugula, pecans and goat cheese. I can't not get it every time I'm in. But I have no doubt the other food items are killer too.. and once the summer ends I'll be forced to get something else seasonal. But that's not a bad thing!  I love tea, so this is just the spot for me. They freshly brew all their ice teas and this summer my go to has been the peach oolong iced tea, that they lightly sprinkle cinnamon on. They also have a variety of loose leaf teas to choose from for hot or cold choices. I can only imagine what I'll get obsessed with once the winter comes along!  The only gripe I have is that the service is on the slower side. If there's a line to order, it may take you a bit to get up to the front to order. The food, like I said, is made to order so it's not going to come out fast, but I wouldn't say it takes forever either. Just be prepared to wait about 15ish minutes.   They have you covered on the wifi, so it's a great place for meetings and getting work done too. Like I need an excuse to come here though... I'm already hooked!",

It gives off a rustic vibe due to the fact that it has a wooden countertop, wooden floors, and wooden tables & chairs as well. The staff is always friendly and more than willing to help. They are reasonably priced - and I love supporting a local business.  Now on to the teas - I love the cold teas here and have tried the Yerba Redhead, the EoJito, and the Peach Apple Cobbler. They all have real pieces of fruit in them - lemons, limes, raspberries, and/or peaches, and I love them all.  The food is fantastic as well, they have many sandwiches, salads, and smoothies! I always get the EO Beef and it's amazing every time. I would highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area and want to try it!",

After a 10 minute wait I started peering over the counter and saw that they hadn't even started yet (mind you there wasn't anyone who ordered ahead of me and several people after me had gotten sandwiches and teas). I didn't say anything as they finally pulled out the blender. The blender struggled and a few minutes later they poured the smoothie contents out and then started trying to break up a chunk ice with a wooden spoon or something. Back in the blender to pulse what remained but it didn't work, as the smoothie I got had a huge mound of ice that blocked my straw at every sip.   I know these guys do tea, but this was really disappointing between the wait, the ice, and lack of mango flavor in the mango smoothie.",

The decor and ambiance is great, although for how large it is, I was surprised at the lack of seating. As we were looking at the chalk board menu the barista stepped over to the register to take our order, I smiled and said hi and she just stared at me. I ordered a medium hot vanilla latte made with almond milk. She just stared. I asked my fiance what he wanted and he just ordered a small black coffee. She asked if the order was together and after I said yes she asked me to repeat my order. I did, she then repeated back to me but she said iced instead of hot. I corrected her and told her it's hot. She put the order in and we waited. They called my name and low and behold theres an iced latte........I told them I ordered it hot and once again I got a blank stare and then was told that the slip says iced. I just took it but at this point I was too nervous to drink it. I'm lactose intolerant which is why I order milk alternatives and if they can't figure out the difference between hot and cold I can't trust them to use the right milk.  We took our drinks and sat down at an extremely unstable table. My fiance quickly downed his coffee and we left. I left my drink outside in case anyone would want it since I was too skeptical to drink it.  I'm giving it two stars because I like the ambiance and I think there's a lot of potential but the customer service was uncomfortable and rude. Not only were they rude but they made me feel very unwelcomed, as if I was bothering them. We were the only ones ordering and they weren't particularly busy so I don't know how my order caused so much confusion. I want to say this was a rare occurrence but I won't be going back to test it.",

They're happy to make recommendations and let you smell any tea you're considering. I stuck with an old favorite - the chai tea latte - can't say it's the best latte I've had, kind of wish I stuck with a regular loose leaf tea to start. They also serve wraps, soups, and salads.

    "text": "I'm so glad I finally got to stop in here! Every time I ride my bike I always thinking about stopping. The other day my fiance and I stopped in to grab a coffee and tea.   She got the lavender lemonade tea. It was a little bitter but the barista sweetened it a bit which made it better. I would definitely order it again.   I got the coffee latte with milk. It was more just coffee and milk than a latte. There was no foam in the drink at all. Either way the coffee had good flavor.   The mood is very welcoming inside to anyone! There were kids with their parents, people working on laptops and couples talking around the corner. There is a big couch to lounge on and an electronic fireplace to make the room even more cozy!   I am excited to visit in the future again to try more items on the menu. If you live in North Side this is a must go to place!",

I stumbled in on a nice summer day. Perfect for an iced tea. I went with the twisted ginger. It was great and refreshing. Loved the actual pieces of ginger and slices of lemon.   There was lots of space to sit and work and the interior looked comfy and inviting.   I will definitely be back when I'm on this side of time!",

    "text": "I installed the Yelp app just to leave a review for this place - it's amazing.   My husband and I have had high tea at several locations before our time at Arnold's. Hands down, Arnold's has them all beat. Not only did they have a table reserved and at the ready for us when we arrived, everything was exquisitely placed and organized. The tea selection was much more robust than any locale we had been to prior, and the pairings (which they have many options to choose from) were exquisite.   The quality of both the tea and food was wonderful, but I would be remiss in mentioning the warm, welcoming atmosphere. The entire area feels very homey without sacrificing any quality, and I would be remiss in saying how relaxing it is here.   Even if you don't want a high tea and just a normal cuppa, I would recommend Arnold's Tea very highly.",

The wood tables and the brick walls and the inviting couch make for what looks to be a great place to meet friends or get work done. The staff was so pleasant making sure we had everything we needed. They set up a large round table for us all to partake in high tea. The tea selection was great, but the food they brought out stole the show. The tiered risers held our many currant scones, mini sandwiches, and variety of desserts. Every thing I tried was so delicious. We left feeling so full and happy that we spent the afternoon there.   I can't wait to go back for another experience trying one of their other meals and another adventurous tea!",
