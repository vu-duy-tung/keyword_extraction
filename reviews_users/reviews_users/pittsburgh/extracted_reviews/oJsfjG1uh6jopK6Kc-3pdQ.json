    "text": "Giving this place one star was extremely generous of me.  Was excited to go here for salsa night with some friends but that quickly soured the second we drove past this place. First - no valet, or at least no sign of valet despite what their website says.  Second - we had to stand outside in the 20 degree temperature for about 10 minutes waiting for the bouncer to find some frat boys ID.  That should have been our cue to run as far away from this place as possible. Turns out, this \"classy establishment\" was catering a party for some frat. As we stood there, 3 overly served, drunker than drunk frat boys pushed and shoved myself and my friends out of their way. One even continued to hit his girlfriend and when I told the bouncer that if he let these kids back in, they were going to lose four paying patrons who actually work for their money.  What did the bouncer do? His response was that \"they were with a party\" and he let all of them back in - despite knowing full well that they were over-served and were already being violent with patrons.  Thankfully the frat idiots never ventured over to the salsa area but the stragglers who did stay in the other room could barely stand up, some were passed out and the room reeked of vomit.  And if there is a dress code for this place, you wouldn't have known it based on the hooker-like attire the girls were wearing.   Needless to say we'll never come back to this place - if we wanted that kind of night we would have just gone to the South Side.",

You get a bottle and mixers that are being refilled throughout the night, the service is great! The staff is on point! The bathrooms are clean, service is prompt, staff is friendly and the atmosphere is perfect. This place really does what it takes to make their customers happy and that's why that's my first choice when I head out. I love how there is such a variety that suites all the different needs and expectations of people when they head out on the weekends.

The potatoes and risotto that accompanied the main courses were just what you would hope for. It is a very interesting Decor. Not at all what you would expect in Pittsburgh. That made it all the more interesting. We will go again and yes it is okay for the over 50 crowd.",

The crowd is always good-looking.  The establishment is sophisticated with a touch of upscale goth.  There is a lot of detail in the decor.   They also serve food which is excellent.   It's not just a dance club.  They also have unique events going on from time to time, like burlesque shows (tastefully done) and drag queen shows. Outside individuals & establishments also use this venue for fundraisers as it's in a convenient location and is a fairly large space with 2 separate areas.    One side has the dancefloor a bar and is high energy.  The other side has a bar and tables and is more low-key & a little quieter where you can sit and have conversation & just chill out with a drink.  It seems like the crowd runs from ages 20s to 40s",

    "text": "I was excited about the possibility of a cool nightclub in the Strip District (far, far away from the madness of Carson Street) but Cavo was such a disappointment.  First, they charge a $5 cover, which I find so obnoxious.  You're in Pittsburgh, not New York or LA, and it was a regular Saturday night, not New Year's Eve.  Second, while we were waiting to get in they turned away a few dudes ahead of us in hoodies due to some pretentious \"dress code\" they seemed very concerned about, but then once we got inside we saw several other brosefs in hoodies.  What's up with that?  Third, they took themselves VERY seriously, with bouncers and nervous dudes in suits with earpieces at every doorway.  Fourth, the DJ was terrible, just terrible.  I usually don't notice that kind of thing, but the way s/he transitioned between songs (or...didn't, as the case was) and the very random selection of music was kind of a downer.  Fifth, the coat check guy was very strange.  First he didn't want to take our coats (what were we supposed to do with them? Wasn't it his job to take them?) THEN at the end of the night he didn't want to give them back to us, saying we hadn't paid him enough.  That's not how you get tips, yo.  The whole vibe of the place was really weird.  Definitely an older crowd (think 30-somethings with money to spend), and they were trying to be upscale but were not very consistent about anything (ex: why be so pretentious if you're going to serve drinks in plastic cups?).  I say pass on this place.",

There was a $5 cover, which I thought was lame but I get it. Sometimes you need a cover to \"cover\" expenses. All the seating areas were reserved but the security guy was nice and let us throw our stuff on one. Typical nightclub and groups of people all had different styles. The huz and I took over the dance floor at 10pm because the DJ was killing it with reggae that took us back to the late 90s. That was my favorite part. An hour later, the club was packed, the music sucked, people were spilling drinks and it reminded me why I hate clubs. My beer soaked jeans and disdain for house music got the best of me and I decided it was time to go a little before midnight.   I like that they try to be pretentious. The decor was pin-up shiek with tuft, velvet couches and ornate, dark frames. There were dancers elevated behind the DJ area and an upstairs we never got around to exploring.",

    "text": "Last year I had went there for my birthday and was also my friend's birthday. Their VIP was nice, we only had one bottle that we had bought and then my brother bought another one - it's ridiculous their bottle prices. I can just go to the liquor store and spend $20 on the bottles rather than $100-200. THIS YEAR, they supposedly had a 3 bottle MINIMUM - when I made the reservation over the phone with Lito - he NEVER told me about that, or else I would not have made the reservation, I do not make that sort of money. He had said that he sent me an email with all of the information about the minimum, never got it, I got a text message with the bottle list, but no where on there said anything about a 3 bottle MINIMUM.   Our waitress was completely rude, obviously she didn't want to be there or wanted to serve us, all the other waitresses that came by to help her were also very rude, taking drinks that weren't empty, and barely looked us in the eyes. I was having a good time dancing - music was great, DJ was awesome, but I started noticing that a pipe above us started leaking, we were getting pipe water all over our stuff, and I walked out of the bathroom and I got leaked all over. Having a waterfall behind the DJ booth - really?? The people who had their VIP there, the water kept splashing out and onto their seats and they couldn't sit down. Also the 2 girls who were dancing in the boxes.. really? I mean they could do without the sluts in lingerie, dancing horribly in there.. the place could be really nice without a lot of things.   There was a really creepy bouncer who looked like the guy from the 1971 movie Shaft. He was blocking our entrance of our VIP area, and he kept doing hand gestures like he was pulling out a gun. It was the oddest thing!! Creepy.    During the night the waitress kept pushing 2 more bottles on us, I looked at her and I said \"No thanks, we only want one\" she kept pushing and said that I had to buy 2 more because of the 3 bottle minimum, I was never told about that and I said no I will not purchase 2 more bottles of liquor at 150/bottle. I had asked for the manager, but no one came, she came back again and said that I had to buy them, so at that point I was annoyed and we picked the cheapest bottles. SHE CHARGED US FOR THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONES!! The ones we didn't even check off. When I got the bill, it was $609. With a forced $96 tip - No. I was livid. It was also so dark in there that I couldn't see the whole bill - also they didn't even put all of the prices of the bottles on the first bill. I only had about $325 in cash, from friends and me paying for my own birthday. I had to charge the rest, but there was no way in hell I was tipping them. After how the waitress and staff had treated myself and my friends, way to ruin a great night. Way to take advantage of people, they are slimy, grimy, greedy, douche bags. Their dress code is bullshit, trying to make it a classy place, when in reality - they aren't classy at all. A place like this belongs in like Florida or California, not Pittsburgh.   NEVER coming back and I would never recommend this place to anyone. Get your asses in gear and change some things up and respect your guests.",

The place isn't too crowded in the early evening--there were people at the bar, while the club area was still empty. The music was pretty good for the club atmosphere, though the vintage films playing on the wall were weird. The waiter was super friendly and attentive, and he sold the specials really well. The grilled filet was perfect--a thick piece of tender beef, garnished with asparagus, mushrooms, and roasted potato wedges. The seafood market had a couple options, and we went with the salmon salad. Greens and vegetables were super fresh, the house vinaigrette was flavorful, and the salmon filet was a good portion of grilled tasty fish. Just take note that it seems that the menu on their site is outdated.",

    "text": "I've been to Cavo twice.  Once, I stopped here with a friend on a night out.  We were actually going to Kava and the bouncer literally recruited us from the street to stop in. This made sense, because there were less than a dozen people in the ENTIRE place (a.k.a, all of the rooms, dance floors, and restaurant) at 10 on a Saturday. Needless to say, we promptly left. I just went back this weekend with a Groupon to their restaurant.  So, I do have to speak highly of the decor and vibe: it's a trendy yet sophisticated place that would seem very pleasant to spend a night at.  There were only 4 other people at the restaurant when we came in for dinner (does this place just not get any patrons before midnight?).  The menu actually looked pretty tasty, yet overpriced- which is what I expected. My counterpart had the burger, which was huge and he said it was tasty. However, there were only 2 vegetarian options other than salads, which is what I've come to expect from fine dining.  I ordered the veggie pasta- which actually wasn't pasta (?)- just shreds of zucchini completely soaked in olive oil.  I could make this dish orders of magnitude less greasy for a fraction of the $16 it cost.  On the other hand, the homemade flourless chocolate cake and ice cream were scrumptious.  Overall, it was a nice night out, but I was really disappointed with my dish- and because there were very few vegetarian options, I will probably not come back for a meal.",

    "text": "Cavo may be great for dancing, but hardly for eating! When the nightclub first opened, I was unimpressed by the dinner selection, but had eaten there 2-3 times for social events hoping that I would have better experiences.   Recently, I was invited to stop by to check out Cavo's brand new re-vamped dinner menu, and was excited to taste the improvements! Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed.   The meatball volcano was odd...the beef (fatty) and sauce were poor quality. After a disappointing appetizer or two I decided to stick with something safe and order a burger. The waitress never asked for a temperature, and while the burger was supposed to come with bacon and a choice of cheese, I was not asked which cheese I preferred, and it was delivered sans bacon completely. The potato wedges were under cooked, and to top it all off, the strawberry in my Sangria had a puff of mold on the top!!   The bill was miscalculated and confusing, but one thing that stood out right away was the 20 percent gratuity that our waitress added on for my intimate party of TWO with poor service.   Overall: hopeful, but pretty disappointed. I had assumed that since I had been invited to try the new menu, that I would have been given a survey of sorts, but since there didn't seem to be anyone around who cared on this particular evening, this is my opinion, and the completion of my Yelp review!!  Hope it helps to improve food quality and service. Thanks.",

I thought Cavo was just a nightclub, but after reading some awesome reviews on yelp, I knew I had to check it out. We visited this past Saturday around 7:00pm. I was surprised to see that we were the first ones in the place. I've been to Cavo before, and was reminded of the beautiful decor and relaxing ambiance as we were seated. Our waiter was really friendly and provided us with excellent service throughout the evening. The menu is small- only two pages, and I was a little disappointed in their selection of appetizers. I decided to go for the grilled filet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My boyfriend ordered the burger. Our entrees came out in good time and were stunning. The lighting is very dim in this place, so it was hard to take a good picture (yes, I am one of those people). My steak was cooked perfectly, the mashed potatoes were super tasty and the asparagus was delicious. The boyf's burger was AWESOME- there was a TON of bacon, which I loved (I snuck a couple bites in) and it was cooked wonderfully. The chips were SO good. They were long like French fries and tasted super fresh. Delicious!  Overall, we were surprised with how impressed we were with this place. I have to admit I was skeptical about the food, but they sure did prove me wrong. I plan on returning!",

Pretty much the only joint in Pittsburgh that can boast good food, good salsa/bachata music AND a good Dj in the non-salsa portion.   It's actually incredible. Not sure if they have a house DJ but the guy who was there on Friday the 26th of August slayed track after track really mixing REAL music whilst keeping the pop-junkies satisfied with the garbage you always hear. Having the ability to choose Salsa/bachata and clubaduba is kinda cool. I found myself going back and forth based on what I was feeling. I will return. CAVO FTW.",

The service is incredible!!!!!! The one bartender Mike felt like family by the end of the night! He was great!! Our waitress Ciara was awesome as well, so sweet and attentive! The manager brought over champagne on the house with a huge sparkler for my sister's birthday ! I want to have all celebrations here and come here more in general!

The dance floor was a bit too cramped to accommodate the amount of people in the club. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The bathrooms are pretty clean, but kind of small. The music was great with a good assortment of oldies and top hits. The crowd reminded me of a dysfunctional wedding party with a good mix of cousin Joe, aunt Mae, uncle Ben, and grandpa George--there's someone for everyone!   Though, Cavo is far from perfection. The drink prices were not too bad, average $5-$8 per drink, but there was literally one drop of alcohol per drink. They also did not clean their cups very well because my cup smelled like cockroach poop. The food was mediocre and not even worth mentioning. What's up with the vintage porn playing on the projectors and the lesbian art all along the walls? As a venue, I never want to be in this place sober, but as a club it's not too shabby.",

Cavo sets themselves a part with a decent sized dance floor,  reasonably priced drinks and a decor that's to die for. I love how dedicated Cavo is to its theme from the art on the walls to the go girls dancing in the window above the dance floor. I've been here a few times and can never say I had a terrible time. I can see why they are still in business. They have a great mix of old and new music on the dance floor and in the front room they play lots of Latin music. I would most definitely recommend this gem to anyone looking for a great night on the town in Pittsburgh. Sometimes it does tend to get too crowded but there's not that many dance options in the Burgh so I guess they should take that as a compliment.",

In the middle there is a bar area and the bathrooms. I enjoyed dancing and thought the music was good! There was no cover charge which is a big plus. There were a few negatives, though: 1. It was SUPER hot in the front room. 2. The drinks were expensive. 3. There is no space to sit down anywhere unless you want to pay for bottle service.  Seems like the dress code is pretty strict. A couple of bros in line ahead of us were turned away because they were wearing tennis shoes and shorts.",

The owners of Cavo take a lot of pride in making sure that every detail is perfect... from the food, to the drinks, to the service, to the atmosphere... my favorite detail being the incredible lighting.

Although it was a good space and place for the table (if you want it to be less crowded), my friends and I wanted to be closer to the dance floor.  We asked the server to move us and once a table was open, they moved us to the very front. It was a fabulous time!  Felt very VIP.  That table has a lot of comfy lounge space and felt private even if it was closer to the dj and dance floor because it was a little elevated.    I like the decor of the place.  They had a python at the time, too, and the owner/trainer of the snake would let you pose and take pics with it.  I thought it was cool.  The bathrooms would be what's expected of a club bathroom experience.  The dj played great dance/club music, so if you're looking for that kind of scene, I would recommend this place.

Maybe it's because I've only been here for events, but I think Cavo is awesome!  I've been here three times to their \"Vain\" events. It's usually three local drag performers and a headliner from Rupaul's Drag Race. The place itself is beautiful on the inside. There is a lounge area, a restaurant area and the main dance floor that's stands next to the amazing waterfall wall. There's also a second floor that overlooks the dance floor and has a separate bar. It's hard to describe the theme of the place but I would describe it as new age gothic. Once you go, you'll get what I mean.   The bartenders and staff have always been nothing but nice to me. Drinks are good, but can be quite expensive. I spent almost $20 on two long islands (including a tip). They also are a little stingy with the alcohol. I've never gone here and really \"got messed up.\" Maybe it's because I'm too busy enjoying the show?   I will definitely be back here for more \"Vain\" events.

Friday night trying to find a spot in the strip to eat after facing my crushed dreams of eating at Gaucho and it only taking 20 minutes to get through the line. I decided to go to Kaya. when my friends and I walk in Kaya we wont be seated for another 1.5 hours- we say no to reservations and walk out. upon walking out we decide to spontaneously try the first spot we see which is CAVO.   We walk in and there is no greeting or waiter to seat us. Just a bar maybe 15-20 people drinking at the bar, a couple lounge tables near the bar- the inside was huge it seemed like a club venue, but it was only 730- no club is really in operation at 730- so after we were interrogated/questioned by a Butch lady who was convinced we showed up for her birthday and felt the right to ask each of us what our current relationship status was... we thought it was a private party.  No one has kicked us out yet and we were all really hungry, so we decided to venture deeper into the building where we saw it open up into a second, event larger room with 2 bars. This is where we caught the waiter, who apologized and took us back to where the bar was to seat us.   So finally we get the menu, not too many items to choose from, but i got fish tacos and a steak salad! After about 15 minutes and a couple refills  the waiter brought us our food... AND  IT WAS INCREDIBLE. The salad was absolutely mouth watering with an array of cheese nuts berries accompanying the steak and lettuce- it knocked my socks off. I wish I had gotten more tacos because they were beautiful and insanely delicious.   The club was clean, service was good once found, to eat it is definitely lively and loud, looked like a fun place to hang out for the night as well.   I will have to come back!!",

    "text": "May be one of the top clubs in Pittsburgh...  Came here on Halloween 2014. The place was packed needless to say. There was a long line we had to wait in (about an hour) to even obtain entry. Bottle service was sold out, so we couldn't participate in that to avoid waiting.  The inside of the club is kind of incredible. A huge chandelier hangs above the main dance floor. The decor is very modern with industrial touches. The drinks my friend and I had, were very expensive, but very strong :-)  My only issue is the bodyguard situation... I understand you have friends that you want to let in with their friends, BUT there were people jumping the ropes when your backs were turned to the people actually waiting in line. I could have jumped the rope,  and I honestly could have several times. Let's be honest... This isn't Miami, NYC, LA, or Vegas. There's no need for that kind of line situation. This is why I've deducted 2 stars.   All in all, Cavo is fun. Next time, I may opt for bottle service with friends to avoid that whole line situation.",

    "text": "Cavo is probably my favorite Pittsburgh nightclub. The first thing I noticed during my earlier years visiting was that it reminded me a bit of the old station square Matrix with a different music style and scene in each room area. Another thing I like about it is it seems like different age groups fit in well whether younger 20s-30s to 40s. The back room is more of the younger hip hop vibe while the front area is usually a more calm, laid back Spanish music choice. The middle area is sort of more chill mingling area rather than dancing. The drink prices are high but pretty average for nightclubs. It is sort of difficult to get bartender attention on super busy nights.   The dress code is pretty typical. I believe no jeans and basketball shoes. I don't think there is any more entry allowed after 1am? There isn't usually a cover charge, I think there may have been on special occasions. There is a $1 fee for coat storage for those that don't use cash, might be good to know. I really like the deco outside the nightclub. I've seen a DJ here multiple times. I really don't think I ever had a bad time here, met several friendly people over the visits. I do wish they had the taco stand every weekend. There has been a couple times really good tacos made after bar closing sold right outside!",

They didn't try to find the guy, they didn't kick the creep out even though they witnessed and saw who he was and could easily find him via video recordings. They didn't call the cops when someone was physically assaulted on their property. Bad look CAVO like yeah you don't want bad publicity for your club but have some decency and respect for human-beings. When someone is assaulted help them, don't brush it under the rug and normalize it like \"oh this happens all the time.\" If this happens all the time, you don't know how to run a good establishment.",

Clubs have just never been my thing so I feel like that'going to effect my review. If I were 21 and loved to dance then this would be the place I'd wanna be at! They had multiple lounge areas, we went to the very back bar with the very loud music and big dance floor. There were girls dancing on platforms on the wall, Bouncers everywhere, people everywhere. The bartenders and waitresses were all gorgeous but half dressed. Mom mode kicking in...I wanted to put jackets on them lol. Drinks were so expensive I vouched to never go have drinks in a club again after this night. My bill came to $40 just for 2 shots of fireball and 3 beers. There was minimal space to move around on the dance floor it was so packed with people. I had a few drinks spilled on me which I do not enjoy, and constantly bumped into. Like I said, nice club if you like this sort of thing, but definitely not for me. I'm rating it for the cleanliness and atmosphere rather than my dislike of night clubs.",

    "text": "I could care less what anyone says.  I love this place.  So many people give me crap about going here or suggesting it...calling me part of the \"Cavo\" crowd.  To thee I say, \" so what mofo.\"  The place is perfect for what it is. A bougie beautiful looking interior reminiscent of what clubs in NYC looked (and still look like) with an awesome blend of music everything from EDM, to Top 40, to my favorite part of the night, 90's hip hop and R&B.  The crowd is hype, the music is great, and the overall vibe is deliciously fun.   I came here for NYE for the first time after four years in PGH last this past January and it was a blast.   I used to frequent the salsa nights on Fridays where cover was free and the music hit home but no so much now.  Either way, Cavo doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't. It's loud, it's obnoxious, it's got its select crowd, but every city needs one. Not everything has to be hipster, not everything has to be a hole in the wall, not everyone in Pittsburgh drinks F*&%n craft beer!   Sometimes you want to dress slick, grab a vodka soda, walk through a place that looks like a scene from \"Eyes Wide Shut\" (for all the millennials, I don't expect you to know this, it just shows how much about royalty you don't know), get your groove on, and go crazy.  Cavo is just that.  I won't miss a lot of things when I leave Pittsburgh, but I will miss a lot of the nights I have had here.  True story.  Kudos.",

We were treated extremely rudely by both a bouncer and a server, who accused one of my friends (a 5'2\" woman) of assault and tried to kick her out of the bar without warning any of the rest of us.    I was with a large group of people, and we were dancing in a group when the server passed through. He claimed to have been hit in the back of the head by my friend who was dancing nearby. A few minutes later, my friend was approached by a Cavo security guard who asked her to \"follow him,\" luckily the rest of the group decided to follow too otherwise we would have had no idea what had happened to her since he then made her leave the club without her coat.   When we tried to ask the bouncer what had happened, he became accusatory and angry, and claimed over and over that she assaulted someone and that \"we have it on tape.\" Personally I find this ridiculous as there is just such a high chance of accidentally being bumped when walking through the busy dance floor, which the servers do frequently.   Overall the Cavo staff were very rude and it was an upsetting encounter. Needless to say, none of my friends or I will be visiting again any time soon.",

Doesn't bother me as long as the music is good and there is some space to move my arms and legs around. The DJs are pretty legit and play a mix of hip-hop, pop, and some 90s classics remixed.

Nothing will ever beat the Matrix. Sorry.  I haven't been dancing (or to a club in general) in a loooooong time and was hesitant to RSVP Yes to a girlfriends bachelorette party here. I quickly ran to Express to find something half decent to wear.... if any of you have seen pics on FB then you're familiar with all of the half naked regulars at this place...   We arrived around 930-10pm and thankfully had a VIP table reserved. The cocktail servers brought us an assortment of alcohol and mixers. Bottle service comes with real life SPARKLERS attached to them. This was huge because I LOVE sparklers. Anyway.  They refilled everything promptly, so the service was fine.  We had a bouncer stationed in front of the two conjoining VIP areas. This was nice because he used his flashlight to help us find things :) And he helped to clean up a champagne glass that *someone* broke (me).   We danced our little faces off. But typically not outside of the confines of a 5 foot radius outside of our area. Music was great. The dance floor got increasingly packed as the night went on. It was very hard to even move. By midnight we were dancing in our little VIP area because there was more room! (Picture 2 love seats a small table and 10 girls).   Bathrooms were decent. The attendant was nice.  Oh and as I was navigating through the crowd.... I got head butted. But I mean, it was an accident, she must've really felt the groove.   I'd probably only ever go back here for a specific event or to check out the other sides of the club (no dance floor, more low key but still fancy looking, hear they serve decent food).   If you go, get there early, reserve VIP if possible (not sure how much it is, we each pitched $40 bucks), and who cares what you wear... some may be in LBD's and suits... but I saw a handful of girls in riding boots and jeans!   Really missing the 80s room...",

Minus stars, though, for the 2 scantily-clad women dancing on stage in one of the back rooms..so unnecessary.  Cavo was packed to the brim! It was a little annoying to keep getting bumped into because there were so many people, but on the bright side, it was great to see all of the creative costumes people came up with.
