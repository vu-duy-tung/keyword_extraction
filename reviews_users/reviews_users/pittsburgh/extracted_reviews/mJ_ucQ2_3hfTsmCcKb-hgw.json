The place is very dimly lit, and during lunch the front of the restaurant was open to direct sunlight. So, it's dark with a glare at the same time. Very annoying. The food and service however was very good. Open-faced eggplant sandwich was tasty (not bitter) and substantial. Pasta salad was good and s nice size portion. I will definitely go back. Just need a small flashlight and polarized sun glasses.",

    "text": "I am giving this restaurant 4 starts based on a salad alone. Crazy, right? Well, the chopped salad was delicious. The cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions are marinated, and then tossed into the chopped romaine. The gorgonzola adds a nice bite that complements the red wine viniagrette. Because I shared a flatbread with a friend, I didn't order meat on my sald, and to be honest, I think the salad stands alone. It really was that good. I am very picky about salads, and when I find a restaurant with delicious salads, the place quickly becomes a staple for me.  I shared a prosciutto/arugula flatbread with a friend, and I enjoyed the crispy crunch of the crust. The prosciutto didn't stay in place very well, so my hands got a little messy, but it was very good nonetheless.  It was a bit dark inside the restaurant at lunchtime, and I almost forgot that the sun was shining outside. But, the decor is tasteful, and though it is smaller side, I think the restaurant's size adds to the intimate, quiet feel of the place.  I was able to get a quick reservation for lunch, and I look forward to trying Sienna for dinner. There were quite a few items on the menu that I would like to try next time.",

Very nice selection of wine, friendly & helpful staff and a chef that takes traditional Italian dishes and puts just a little spin on then.  The Arugula salad was a very nice starter.  Light with a blend of tartness and sweet (from the strawberries).  I then had the meatballs from the appetizer menu for my main coarse.  They were described as the best and did not disappoint.  I would recommend Sienna on the Square",

I was feeling fiesty tonight, so I decided to \"start\" with a Caprese flatbread.  When it arrived, it was clear this bread would be my starter and finisher. It was BIG.  I believe the juicy grape tomatoes were marinated in some sort of balsamic perfection incarnate.  Shreds of basil complemented this flat piece of masterpiece and I'm still full just thinking about it. Jonathan D. ordered the Beef Ravioli + a mozzarella-stuffed meatball.  Both two thumbs up.  The only thumbs done portion of the evening was the bread selection.  Straight outta Shur Save I suspect; and a warm loaf of Breadworks would be just the ticket to a five-star review IMO.  BUT, extra points given that Mario Lemieux was seated at the table next to us. Truth. It was incredible.  So, Sienna - thanks for that!",

    "text": "Stopped in here while in town and since I didn't have a reservation, I had to sit at the bar. It's a cute little restaurant in Market Square with both indoor and outdoor seating. It was restaurant week in Pittsburgh, so I went with the $20 3-course meal which included a choice of salad, entree, and a dessert. The arugula salad was good with roasted peppers and fresh shavings of parmesan cheese in it. The Rigatoni & Shrimp pasta was in a basil pesto creme sauce and was OK, but I wished it had a few more shrimps other than three of them. I went with the tirimisu and was quite disappointed. First off, it was served in a glass cup, which I've never seen before and it had a distinct citrusy taste to it. I love tirimisu so I've had a lot of them over the years, and this was by far my least favorite.   Service was just OK and a bit slow for my liking. Portion sizes tend to be on the smaller size here, but I'm OK with that as I don't want all the calories. Between the 3-courses, I left full. The price was good for what I got, but this was a reduced price for restaurant week, so had this been any other week and I paid normal prices (around $26 for what I had), I would say the place is a little over-priced.",

I also ordered a meatball (everything is a-la-carte) which was easily the greatest meatball I have ever eaten and ever will eat haha.

Very good service from a very short server (sorry I forget her name).    So onto the food, we decided to order one thing from each section of the menu and share.    First course-Greens & Beans- I loved, gf did not.  I think she was expecting more of southern style, even though she is Italian.    Second course- Mesculin salad- all the flavors went very well together, the pear & goat cheese, and red onion vin.  Third course-Braised Rabbit Pasta, absolutely the star of the night, I could eat this everyday.  Last course- Prosciutto wrapped Salmon.  Salmon was done correctly, but I don't believe there was any prosciutto wrapped around the salmon.  I could not see or taste it.  Also, I really didn't enjoy the eggplant caponata paired up with the salmon.  Personally I thought it was a strange pairing with the salmon.    Overall good experience, one of the better dinners I've had in Pittsburgh, will return.",

We wanted some vino, saw people outside Sienna drinking vino, said let's try it....  Ordered glasses of wine at happy hour prices--$6 each!!! from CA, that is a bargain.  Looked around, liked the vibe, liked the bartender, said what the hey?  Ordered three things--the mussels, the roasted beets, and a flatbread pizza.  They were ALL wonderful.    My fav was the mussels--oh my gosh.  The sauce...make sure and get bread to sop up.  Yeah, don't be a Miss Manners--sop up the sauce....  The beets were different.   But I liked them.  They were surrounded by ricotta and went well with bread.  The flatbread was good, had an entire arugula salad on top.  And the service was great.  We sat at the bar, the bartender was great--sorry, didn't catch your name!--and gave us great tips for things to do.  My first impression of Pittsburgh is very good.....",

It was a total win-win situation. The calamari was cooked to perfection, super tender, and lightly breaded. The sauce was a delectable smokey red sauce. The portion was small, but packed a lot of taste! I also ordered the cocktail of the day which was an Old Fashioned and equally good. Wasn't watered down like typical happy hour specials. I really need to give dinner a try there. I'm sure I won't be disappointed!!",

Makes me think the chicken was prepped ahead and is heated for service. That's fine if it's actually heated to the proper temp. The pasta salad was just okay. I would have preferred a salad or warm pasta for the side rather than chips or cold pasta salad. I don't think I'll go back as there are so many other restaurants to try.",

My friend had the linguini with mussels and I had the bolognese - both were good, but not great.  They left us with room for dessert, so we split the raspberry tiramisu which should probably be renamed since it didn't remind us of tiramisu at all.  Also worth mentioning that their cocktails are tasty, but were weak on alcohol content - disappointing for $10 a glass.  Overall decent meal in a nice setting, but there are probably better options.",

The salad was very good, but the bolognese was atrocious. The noodles were hard as a rock; barely cooked. Everyone else at the table had the same complaint about their food- no matter what they got, the noodles were extremely undercooked. I tried my friend's meatball, there was really nothing special about it. We sat at the big table near the front of the restaurant, it was difficult to get in and out and too much traffic. The service was decent, but my only recommendation would be to avoid this place.",

The Calamari was so tender and the smoky dipping sauce was to die for. Every item is well worth the price and the atmosphere and service is outstanding and so pleasant.

The bartenders were great and allowed me to taste one of the wines before I decided on which I wanted.   After my party arrived, we were seated and the attentive waiter took our orders, but he would not allow us to substitute anything. I do not like gorgonzola cheese. I think it is disgusting and tastes bad, so I asked the waiter if he could substitute a different cheese like feta on the salad I was going to order. He told me the chef does not allow any type of substitutions to anything and that I could have it without cheese. Well this was unacceptable to me because there wasn't much else on the salad to begin with, so I opted to not purchase it. I also asked well what if someone is allergic to an ingredient, would you not substitute something in that scenario and he said the chef wouldn't. So, I personally thought the chef was a bit full of herself and lost her establishment money because I ended up not ordering a salad. The rest of my meal was fine, it didn't compare to what I had while I was in Italy, but then again I didn't expect it to.   I think this is a great place for wine and plan on going back for happy hour only. No food.",

    "text": "I've been here twice before, once with a friend for happy hour drinks and another time to meet up with my son and daughter-in-law for dinner before a show. I had excellent experiences both times. Today I stopped in for a bite for lunch and the excellence continues.   The ambience at Sienna is contemporary with low lighting and Caribbean infused jazz playing just loud enough in the background to create a cozy, inviting and, dare I say, romantic atmosphere.  The bar is fully stocked and they carry a modest selection of craft beers. It's finally getting warm enough now outside that they were able to open the front wall (garage door style) of the restaurant exposing the place to the sights and sounds of Market Square. They even offer sidewalk seating for those early enough to snatch up a table there. I, however, wasn't so fortunate and took a seat at the bar.   After taking a stool I was promptly and cheerfully greeted by the bar keep with a glass of ice water. I glanced at the menu and hesitantly decided on the Open Face Chicken Parmesan Sandwich with a side of pasta salad. I say hesitantly because I haven't had a good chix parm in the Downtown-CBD yet.   It took less than ten minutes for my meal to come out and I was oh so pleasantly surprised. In front of me was a juicy plump chicken breast covered in delicious Italian inspired marinara sauce (that was obviously in-house made) topped with a generous coating of provonello all sitting on top of a lone slice of focaccia. A pinch of basil sat capped off to the side on the provonello as if to say, \"we believe in attention to detail\". It's been a long time since I had chix parm that simply looked this good. If the presentation gets an \"A\", the taste of this here dish gets an \"A++\"! The side pasta salad was a nice touch. It was dressed lightly and paired perfectly with the parmesan.  My total bill came to $11.77 plus tip.  If you've dined enough in the Downtown-CBD you know you can spend a lot more for a meal of this quality.  I really can't say enough good things about Sienna Sulla Piazza.... Excellent service, comfortable atmosphere, delicious meal all for a more than reasonable price.  Five stars just doesn't seem enough.",

I highly recommend reservations as this is a small place. We had stopped in here a few weeks ago for drinks and were back for dinner. We ordered French martini's and they were very tasty. I stopped at one as I had not eaten and was beginning to feel quite shaky. Our table was ready and we were seated. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the food and gave his recommendations. We both decided on the bucatini with mozzarella stuffed veal meatballs for dinner, I ordered the orzo Mac n cheese as an appetizer as I was starving, and my boyfriend had the tomato bisque. The tomato bisque was very tasty, and my orzo Mac n cheese was very creamy and delicious. I must note that there was not salt n pepper on the table, and that must be because you don't have a need for it. All dishes are seasoned well. Our dinners arrive and again, everything is extremely tasty. The meatball was seasoned perfectly and the mozzarella oozed out when you cut it in half. I will definitely be back again.

    "text": "I had high hopes for a wonderful evening at Sienna Sulla Piazza but those expectations were dashed on the rocks by uninspired food, fair to poor service and  a sound system that blared inappropriate music for an upscale restaurant.  I had read a lot of good reviews of Sienna which had my mouth watering.  Unfortunately I had a below average experience.  The restaurant itself is small, with tables both indoors and outside.  We had made a reservation for a table inside and were unfortunately seated under one of the many speakers from the restaurants sound system.  The ceilings were quite high but the loud rock music which rang out from their system was very annoying and made it difficult to have a normal conversation with my dinner companion.  I don't mind loud music but I prefer to experience it at a club or concert where I have paid, knowing that my ears will be ringing by the time I leave.  In my opinion, Pink Floyd and The Doors are totally inappropriate music for what I was expecting in a fine dining atmosphere.  (By the way, I love those bands, just not when I'm shelling out $$$$ for dinner)  I asked the waiter if he could have them turn down the music but was told, (for some reason) that the spotify system that it was playing from, could not be adjusted.  Okay, I was a waiter for ten years and know all the tricks of the trade and I know when I'm getting a load of BS .  The menu is small and although it has definite variety as far as Italian specialties, (pizza to pasta to an octopus salad), it felt as if the chef was handicapping himself with such limited variations under those themes  The wine, cocktail and wine by the bottle listings are also small but with good character and moderate pricing for a downtown Pittsburgh restaurant.  My dinner companion went for a glass of wine (11$) house salad and one of the homemade pasta specialties, which was suppossed to  have a variety of seafood.  I chose the octopus salad app and the short rib entree.  The house salad was uninspired with lots of iceberg lettuce, mixed with a few field greens and tomatoes, all chopped up to a pulp and drenched with some type of bland dressing.(7$)  The octopus salad was served warn with white beans, a red pepper puree and some arugula (11$)  a good size portion, with a hint of spice and actually, very good flavor, despite the over infusion of mustard seeds.  The seafood pasta entree, which was served, tossed in a lobster cream sauce was dull, with nondescript flavoring and not a lot of seafood.  I will say that the homemade pasta was quite good but for the price, there wasn't much of it (24$)  Important to note that chef Matt Porco must have gotten a good deal on a ton of shishito peppers (found mostly in east asian cooking) because too many of the dishes on the current menu feature them.  The braised short rib(also 24$) had my mouth watering and even though my ear drums were being assaulted with blue oyster cult and leonard skinnard, I was ready to dig in.  Once again, portion size for the beef rib was small. It lay in a large cloud of mashed potatoes which were in need of salt and pepper and flavor.  Around the potato was a ring of pickled jardiniere (cooked vegetables, sometimes pickled)  The meat itself was dry and there was no sauce whatsoever to help with flavor.  The pickled garnish was over empowered with vinegar that its pungent aroma overwhelmed the meek flavoring of the rest of the dish.  Desert menu is skimpy with only three deserts, one of which incorporated balsamic vinegar into it's pastry cream.  The menu also features flat breads which we did not have but looked interesting.  However I always say that if i want  good pizza, I will just order it from my favorite pizza shop in my neighborhood, where I know won't be disappointed.  I think it's safe to say that mediocrity reins supreme at Sienna Sulla,",

That was the only \"downside\" to the evening. After our server came to us, he apologized for the wait and was super attentive the remainder of the evening.

The ambiance was lovely, the waitstaff was accomadating, the area is cute and good for out of town visitors (and parking, if it's a weeknight after 6 p.m.).

I have gone to Sienna both for dinner and lunch.  The meal both times has been fantastic BUT the hostess (same one both times) was rude, condescending, and inappropriate.  I hope management reads this and has a talk with her.  I understand that I am one person and would NEVER take up a big table on a busy night at a restaurant.  I'm happy sitting at the bar.  That being said-- on a Monday night in an empty restaurant, I expect to be welcomed kindly.  No looking me up and down, and quesitoning \"on, ONE person? Dining ALONE? Well... I guess we have space for you at the bar.\"  No kidding, in the empty restaurant- thanks.  Then I went there again at lunch (WANTING to eat at the bar) when it was early and there were tons of tables open and the bar was full and again-- the look, the grimace.  It is a SHAME that a restaurant with such fantastic food (meatballs, octopus appetizer, flatbread, and wine selection are AMAZING) chooses to put such an ugly face forward.  I would love to have Sienna on my weekly restaurant rotation but instead am opting for Meat & Potatoes (MUCH busier but still recognize me with a warm welcome) and Penn Avenue Fish Company (same thing-- busy but welcoming).",

After driving around hoping to stumble on a great restaurant while visiting Pittsburgh, I consulted yelp and spotted Sienna. 4 stars and 2$ (I'd say leaning toward 3 but well worth it) -- my kind of place.  Everything was home made -- pasta, sausage, meatballs with a mozzarella core.  I highly recommend the gnocchi. Great atmosphere, great music, great food, great find!",

My coworkers steered us here on a recent visit, and it was a lovely experience. Service was efficient but not rushed, and all of us were quite enthusiastic about our food. I had a delightfully rich carbonara that had the perfect balance of peas and pancetta in a sinful egg sauce. Aside from nearly falling asleep in a meeting after that, I couldn't have been happier with lunch.",

Surprisingly un-ordinary real Italian food, not a place for boring Americanized pasta dishes. (Their octopus and beef osso bucco are to die for.) The only tricky thing is their menu frequently changes, which is great, but some of the things I've loved there aren't always there every time. They should keep the beef osso bucco on every day. :)  Very friendly bar/server staff, relaxed atmosphere.",

The parmesan-stuffed meatballs oozing deliciousness, and the buccatini (tube-shaped spaghetti) were perfectly al dente. Homemade gnocchi were flavorful little pillows accompanied with wild boar (!), zucchini, beans and bacon in a tomato sauce. I will definitely be back to try some of the other items.",

It is wonderful on a nice day, with the front open of the restaurant opening onto Market Square.  It is best to make a reservation on opentable if you can because it does get a big crowd between 12-1.  I have also gone for drinks after work, they have nice wines and drinks and it is a very pleasant place to relax.",

Unlike True italian, the dishes are \"fusion\" creative. I had the gemelli with lobster cream and was still thinking about it the next morning. What is the thing in Pittsburgh about Shisito peppers though? I can't deny that the flavor was a tasty addition, but they seem to be on 98% of restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh. Attentive, friendly service. Very well stocked bar.  Why not five stars?? I don't know - I think that's reserved for the very special, like Tony's Trattoria in Bologna before his mom turned over the sauce making to the daughter-in-law.  Sigh.",

    "text": "There's some great things about Sienna: (1) Great location, nestled right next to Nola in the heart of the square (2) Heavy Pours! (I'll be back for a happy hour in the not too distant future) (3) Atmosphere.  One thing I wished it had, but didn't find, was food so good it would keep me coming back!  We started with the tomato bisque and the sausage, potato, and kale soup- for me this was the highlight of the meal.  The tomato bisque had just the right balance of acid and cream, and was served with a grilled crostini.  The sausage and kale soup was also very tasty and full of their homemade sausage, which we later ordered as a side- it was so good!  We thought this was a lead up to some phenomenal mains, but we were a little disappointed.  We tried the beef ravioli, which unfortunately had a creamy tomato sauce very similar to the bisque, and the prosciutto and arugula flatbread.  I LOVE prosciutto and arugula, but in my opinion it's best served simple with a little bit of olive oil, a couple of shaves of spicy parmesan, and cracked black pepper.  The flatbread had a tomato and melted mozzarella base.  Together, with the prosciutto and parmesan, this was just too salty for me.  The service is top notch and the bartender was incredibly attentive (try the lost at sea, you won't regret it!);  these 2 factors certainly contributed to their \"Best New Restaurant of Pittsburgh 2013\" title.  Overall and all things considered, I will be back to try more from the menu- this place has too much going for it for me not to give it another shot! Hopefully you'll see this review upgraded in a month or two!",

My family and I went to dinner here on a Saturday night. First sign of a bad restaurant is that it has many vacant tables. The next sign is when they're out of everything you actually like on the menu. If those two signs aren't enough, a haughty waitstaff and a chef who is unable to accommodate a vegan should really send you packing. The already underwhelming and limited menu was not friendly to anyone with allergies or dietary restrictions and the fact that a \"chef\" couldn't come up with anything vegan was beyond us. Even though the chef had vegetables and pasta, he refused to put the two together to make a dish. In my opinion he wasn't actually a chef but perhaps a cook told only to make menu items. The waitress was rude, the manager never came to speak with us, so we paid for our overpriced drinks and left. The funny thing is I wouldn't have bothered to review this place but they \"canceled\" my OpenTable reservation so I wouldn't write a review on that platform. Now I'll make sure to write my review everywhere else.",

    "text": "We cannot review the food because the restaurant failed to honor our 6:00 reservation made over a week in advance--Sienna did not have our table ready. The hostess told us we could wait at the bar, but with only one seat for the 2 of us (I'm not used to sitting on my hubby's lap in public), we respectfully declined.  Instead of apologizing or offering us an appetizer or drink or a kind word (as we told them we had to be somewhere by 8:00), they were unconcerned and unapologetic.  The hostess was obviously too inexperienced to make amends, and the manager was surly, confrontational, and unprofessional. By 6:35 we were forced to improvise (La Cucina next door, which was fabulous) so that we could make our 8:00 concert.   Lastly, who's with me that a manager should at least have his shirt tucked in?   No need to take the time to thank us for feedback--use the time instead to train your staff and manager that \"customer service\" is not an oxymoron, and that seating customers is actually a necessary first-step. My time is valuable too.",

The salmon was done a little more than I would have considered medium-rare, but it was very good, and the arugula and tomato/eggplant dish were unbelievably flavorful, so I did not mind at all.   I enjoyed my meal so much that I went the next day with a client even though we did not have a reservation.  I ordered a 'side arugula salad' with a side of a mozzarella-stuffed meatball.  I also ordered the tomato/eggplant that accompanied the salmon the day before because it was that good.  The meal was great, and we were very glad to be seated even though the restaurant was packed. The service was pretty good each time. I do not think I have ever been dissatisfied with the service.  BTW, the Malbec Nieto wine from Mendoza, Argentina was excellent as well.

Started off with the mussels, literally so delicious.. the sauce was to die for. The roasted chickens skin was seasoned how I like it however my friend thought it was too salty but like I said, I liked it. The actual chicken though had a weird texture to it, like almost mushy? Yeah, I'll for with mushy. Although I was full, I still managed to eat some of the dessert and I'm so glad I did - the lemon cake literally melted in my mouth. Phenomenal! As for drinks, I had a Moscow mule which was good and my friend had a lemon drop which I'm told was good. We waited for our server for about twenty minutes, which clearly gave us plenty of time to decide what we wanted to eat. As a server, I get it though - you get busy, no one tells you that you've been seated.. I don't blame him, he was super nice and did a great job - even though we waited for so long.

Service was excellent.  From the busboy to our waitress.  She was able to describe and explain many items on the menu and wine list with a very detail description! As to the food.  Just OK!  Started with a liver appetizer that was a special and it was tasty but the liver was a little overcooked and a little tough.  Our Sienna Chopped Salad was way overdressed, just saturated with dressing and had very little flavor.  Even the gorgonzola seemed flat due to the overdressing.  My Lemon Spaghetti was OK, but again over saturated with sauce and the only real flavor was the lemon lacking any basil or spinach flavor that it should have had.  Was able to get a taste of a meatball.  It was good, not overcooked like most restaurants and tasty but not as good as my Mom's.  I guess I am over the meatball craze.

My family got the crispy calamari, it was fried perfectly and paired beautifully with the lemon aioli and pickled peppers, the perfect bite to start the meal. For entrees my father and I got the linguine, my sister got the lemon spaghetti, and my mother got the sea scallops. All of the dishes were delectable and each ingredient was delicious on its own. Notably the scallops were mouthwateringly good and the linguine tasted great especially with its smoked mussels with a True smokiness flavor and shisoki mushrooms. The recent renovation to Sienna makes for a brighter and more modern feel that in my opinion takes away some of the restaurants elegance. Menu is fairly small and mostly pasta but I would willingly eat anything on it. I highly recommend and will be going back soon.",

    "text": "While I was visiting the annual holiday market I decided to try this place out for lunch. I was seated immediately. The area where I was seated was a bit dark but if you go up a small flight of stairs there is better lighting with additional seating and a full service bar.  Since this place is Italian, I was inquiring about one of their soups called apple and caramelized onion. The waitress explained that is not your traditional French onion soup but is flavorful. I proceeded to order the eggplant Parmesan open faced sandwich. It comes with your choice of chips or a pasta salad. She told me that this sandwich is large so I decided to pass on the soup for the time being.  I got my lunch fairly promptly and she was right! There were actually two eggplants on the sandwich covered with marinara sauce, provolone, and basil on ciabatta bread. The eggplant was delicious! My only problem was cutting it even though I was given a sharp knife. it was not dry nor overcooked so I wanted to enjoy every bite of it.  The pasta salad that I requested definitely tasted homemade and there was so much of it that by the time I had eaten everything, I was grateful I didn't order the soup.  They offer free WiFi there and the waitress was very friendly and attentive to my needs. Best of all the meal is very reasonably priced for lunch. They do offer flatbreads as well as a price fix menu for $20.00 where you can pair an entree with a side of pasta.  I arrived at noon shortly after it opened and by the time I left the place was packed with people. Reservations aren't necessary for lunch but I would suggest it if you plan to come while the holiday market is going on. People will be looking for places to get out of the cold weather.  I was very pleased with my lunch and plan to return soon.",

    "text": "We made a reservation for a Tuesday night and arrived on time, but still had to wait a few minutes for our table. The restaurant is on the smaller side, so it was mostly filled.   I had the \"Hopeless Romantic\" (tequila blanco, benedictine, cinnamon, apricot, lime) and it wasn't bad, but it was really weak. My friend agreed that her Rosemary Lemon Drop (vodka, limoncello, lemon, rosemary) was weak too.   For my entree, I chose the linguini with mussels. It was good and there were more mussels than I expected, but there wasn't much of the linguini. The dessert we shared was the raspberry tiramisu. We've never seen tiramisu placed in a glass cup before, so that was kinda cool. Both of us agreed that it didn't really taste like tiramisu though.  Their menus are folded into squares like napkins, which is cute, but mine was ripped at the edges. Unless that's what they were going for, might help to reprint them on new sheets of paper.  Weak drinks and small portions for everything (food and drinks), but decent food and great location in Market Square. Worth a try I guess if you like Italian and are looking for a place with a nice atmosphere.  Taste | 3 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3.5 Service | 3 OVERALL | 3",

    "text": "Inviting little Italian restaurant with an intimate, upscale feel in the middle of the market square. It's open front lends itself to a great view of the square while dining.  We had the bucatini with mozzarella stuffed veal meatballs and I enjoyed the Mafade Bolognese made with veal, pork, beef, tomato, milk, and carrots. Both were delicious.   We started with the authentic Caesar salad made with fresh, crisp romain, a made from scratch Caesar dressing with anchovies topped with large shreds of aged Parmesan. Delicious.   The generous portion of meatballs were made fresh, bursting with flavor, light and fluffy; not dense like the golf balls other restaurants might serve.  The dish included a very thick, long noodle that was made fresh and sauced with a rich and flavorful red sauce. Our server claimed they are known for their meatballs, I have no doubt this is True. Well done.   The Mafade Bolognese was jam packed with flavor and I couldn't put my fork down; if I wasn't with company I would have seriously licked the plate. The made from scratch noodle was wavy, like the edge of a lasagna noodle; a perfect vehicle for transporting large quantities of this delectable sauce.  A thick, slightly sweet red sauced was subtlety spiced with what I think was cinnamon that really made the whole dish just pop. A very unexpected but delightful surprise.   Service was spot on as you would imagine.  The quality of the food, the inviting atmosphere offers much more than you might imagine for a reasonably priced establishment such as this.    Well done. I will be back the next time I'm in town.",

I understand that chefs like to prepare things a certain way as it is an experience they want to deliver consistently. I am just one of those people that likes to substitute. The food was delicious. We had a bruchetta to start that was vegetarian. Very fresh and flavorful ingredients. We didn't have dessert. This is a rather small restaurant and there were a few larger groups yet the noise level was still very comfortable.",

I picked the restaurant and knew immediately the people I was with were not too happy about it. There is not very much on the menu.  Lots of flipping it over looking for more. The people who ordered anything with red sauce loved it. My friend ordered the lemon spaghetti and didn't like it. She said it had no flavor and not enough shrimp. The chopped salad is the best. I had the red pepper flat bread as my meal and it was good. We had to hunt the server down for more drinks.

We insisted that we move to our server and eventually were moved to a large family style table with another family that we did not know...awkward.   Our server also semi-neglected us because she was trying to give speedy service to another table who had to catch a show at 7:30. Well, we were going to the same show and her focus on them and lack of attention to us made us late for the show.   Sienna needs to step up their customer service.

We ordered the octopus for our appetizer which had very bitter vegetables and sauce. My sangria tasted very fresh but there was a strong mint tone to it that I did not enjoy.   They serve their bread with a creamy spread that reminded me a little of refried beans. It was unusual, but had a nice taste (fiance hated it). I would prefer dipping oil. This is not the place to come if you want simple, classic Italian food. Their entrees are all ruined by the bitter veggies and sauces, and the vegetarian options are sparse. I ended up getting the four cheese flatbread which was very greasy and had a nice crisp to the crust...if you only ate the edges. Fiance's prosciutto wrapped salmon was undercooked in the middle and sitting in a pool of disgusting red sauce that he said ruined the entire dish. Not to mention tables are so close together that you can hear everyone's conversation! Was a disappointing choice for our anniversary dinner, but the one plus is that the service was great and our server knew the menu extensively.",

I was so sad as it sounded delicious!  So we had the ceasar salads, I had the scallop risotto, and Chris had the mushroom flatbread. The ceasar salads were good but be prepared to really like anchovies as the dressing is loaded with them. The scallop risotto was fantastic. Creamy, decadent, scallops were perfectly cooked as was the risotto. I would hands down order this dish again. But the flatbread was best described as interesting, and not in a particularly great way. To start it was loaded with truffle oil so all you could smell was the truffle oil. I could smell it from across the table. It was a bit too much. The flatbread was described as kalamata olives, mushrooms, and an egg on top. I was disappointed that the olives were a paste as opposed to slices of olive and either the truffle oil was too over powering or this paste had no flavor. Either way there were no briney, yummy, olivey goodness. If I had closed my eyes, I would never have even known they were present. And as far as the runny egg on top, it created a texture that just wasn't pleasant. I think if the egg had been slightly more cooked, the truffle oil reduced, and whole kalamata olives been used then this would have been a fantastic flat bread. All in all I think we would go back. Service was great, the setting on a beautiful summer afternoon was wonderful, and I'd like to try their dinner menu!",

The four cheese flatbread is thin crust and oven fired.  It tasted fairly bland and had too much ricotta.    The unfortunate thing that disappointed me about this experience was the excruciating slow service after I was seated:  thus, a three star rating.",

We were promptly greeted and had our drink orders taken. Service was fantastic throughout our meal. The real star of the show was the food though, oh the food!! I am beyond particular about Italian food in Pittsburgh. If I'm going to order pasta, I was it to blow me away. The food at Sienna knocked my socks off!   We started with the Octopus, and it was prepared deliciously. The sauce that accompanied it was just as delicious. The only thing that threw us was the beans that it was served with. Neither of us particularly liked them, but at the rest of the dish emphatically. Next we had our entrees, we both had pasta. I had the bolognese and my partner had the rustic gemelli. Both were out of this world!  I loooooved the sauce in the gemelli, and the bolognese had the perfect portion of meat and sauce. The noodles were fresh and cooked to perfection.   All in all, I cannot wait to come back! I'm already dreaming of the day!",

I had the Caprese (tomato mozzarella) salad to start which was fresh and delicious. For my entree, I really enjoyed the grilled swordfish which was poached in olive oil and served atop rounds of fried zucchini and succulent oven roasted tomatoes. My dining companion's tomato risotto was an outstanding melange of creamy Arborio rice studded with sundried tomatoes and basil.  The decor at Sienna Sulla was a cozy mix of exposed brick walls, swirly glazed glass tabletops and low lighting, all of which made for a pleasant dinner ambiance. There were a few tables outside but the interior seemed more inviting so we sat inside by the large bay window looking towards Market Square.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly but not intrusive. I would happily return to Sienna Sulla when I'm back in Pittsburgh!",

(The key word is \"confit\"....Confit (French, pronounced [kfi] or in English \"con-fee\") is a generic term for various kinds of food that have been cooked in oil or sugar water (syrup). Sealed and stored in a cool, dark place, confit can last for several months. Confit (\"prepared\") is one of the oldest ways to preserve food,[citation needed] and is a speciality of southwestern France.)  My friends received two greasy chicken legs with a slice of lemon in top. When my friends explained that they didn't realize it would be a \"chicken leg piccata\", and after back and forth with the manager, he finally removed the uneaten greasy chicken legs from their bills. He also stated that he would be changing the wording of the menu that evening, but said \"Confit is a word used in fine dining establishments!\"  Fine dining? Your waiters are wearing t-shirts and jeans and one of the most expensive items on the menu was the Swordfish special for 23.00! Not fine dining. Casual. Just like the attitude.",

Speaking of which, the menu is limited yet somehow also diverse. More options appealed to us than we could eat at once, so we resolved to come back to order the other ones. This time we shared the arugula salad (which gave off a beguiling aroma like summer BBQ?) and a glass of rose. The wine was delicious, and I do not know why I continue to be surprised at how small the pour is at fancy restaurants. Hubby liked his flank steak with sweet potatoes two ways, while I found my charred scallops with cauliflower three ways to be an odd, monochromatic mixture of textures. Next time we can afford $50+ per person, I would like to try the beets and risotto.",

I never heard about the combination and it was just a feast for the flavor to the mouth. Pasta coocked perfectly all dente, the strange combination of the pesto and the tomato jam left me absolutely speechless. Whoever came up with this dish is a True genius and the executing of the dish was just perfect. Pasta, perfectly coocked, amount of pesto, perfect( and smart to do it with spinach), amount of tomato jam and sourness of it, perfect.

Can't go wrong with Italian, right? The space is intimate and warm, yet modern and trendy. Sitting outside in market square adds even more of the downtown Pittsburgh experience.   I don't have Italian food often, but when I do, I really appreciate a homemade pasta, which Sienna on the Square has. As an appetizer, we shared the Mozzarella Stuffed Meatballs, which were very moist and flavorful. I ordered the Linguini Carbonara as my entree, while the hubby got the Mafalde Bolognese, and the boss got the Pan Seared Chicken. My carbonara was delicious, but I found the sauce to be very strong on the black pepper, which I personally enjoyed, but I would imagine others might find it to be too much. I can't speak too much on the other dishes but our waitress told us the recipe for the Bolognese sauce here is much like the recipe for Emporio's (in case you've tried it at Emporio); the only difference is Emporio's only has pork while Sienna on the Square's has veal, pork, and beef. Good to know!  Even though the food was rather enjoyable, I found the food menu to be quite limited. The drink menu, on the other hand, used up quite a few pages to list all the options. However, it's still a nice place to enjoy dinner outside in the heart of downtown.",

There was something a little off about the taste, maybe a little burned? I couldn't put my finger on it. But it didn't stop me from eating it, as I was hungry, and if you put enough really good cheese on a thing, that solves a lot of problems. The pasta salad side was good, and the service was unremarkable. Probably the most pleasant aspect of the meal was a seat facing a sunny square. Nice people-watching. I'd go back.",

The server was knowledgeable about our questions on the menu but did not stop at our table nearly enough or apologize/explain/let us know our food would take an hour and half. We got an appetizer which came out quick but forgot the bread we had asked to eat with our meat/cheese for and by the time she came back to the table it wasn't as worth it. But then we ended up filling up on bread because our meals took so long to come out after the appetizer. And during that time not once were we apologized to, offered anything, and were avoided other than the server stopping back to try to get us to get another drink. By the time the food came it was mediocre at best- I got a crab cake and salad she got a pasta dish. We didn't even want it but ate what we could or had (I ate mine because it was about 3 bites in meal) paid the over priced prices and left with regret of choosing here. Very disappointing and regret not asking for a manager. Won't be back",

    "text": "Decided to come here on a Saturday night, we had reservations but on this particular evening it didn't appear that they would've been needed. I wish that I would have asked to be seated at a \"regular\" table but there was a large group of folks dining in the front of the place so we were seated at a \"high top\" table close to the bar area. The \"high top\" was certainly high and it wasn't the most comfortable place to have dinner. Moving on we tried a bunch of items and really went all out and were very satisfied with our choices.  The Rabbit Rillette was on the menu and a rillette is something that I can almost never pass up. It was rich and flavorful and the serving size was quite substantial for the price. We then tried a caprese flat bread which was very fresh tasting and a nice change of pace after the Rillette. I then had the Chianit Braised short rib entree, this meat was cooked almost beyond perfection if that is possible. The flavor was so savory and the meat was so incredibly tender I felt almost as if I had ordered a roast. I'm not sure if it wa a normal butchered short rib as the meat was actually boneless and that surprised me a bit nevertheless what's good is good, Right?  The service was nothing short of perfect, the server was very friendly and knew what he was talking about when it came to the menu items. I would certainly come back here again but would hope to sit at a more comfortable table if I have made a reservation in advance.",

The rabbit pasta was very flavorful although you need to like game to enjoy it.  The waiter was upfront about that which I appreciate.  It is noisy, at least when all the outside tables are filled because the weather is good.  Crowd was mixed from business people dressed at the high end of business casual to tourists and kids in shorts.   It was a pleasant mix of people having a nice evening out and there were some between table conversations which appeared to be welcomed by both sides.  More of a community/small town feel than most downtown restaurants.  We were seated on time and served promptly so we didn't experience any of the problems that others have reported with timing or service but then we didn't have a show to go to and just wanted to sit and talk over good food in a pleasant atmosphere for two hours.  Prices seemed fine to me and cheaper than most of the higher end downtown restaurants ($40/person plus tip for 1-2 drinks + soup + pasta and no dessert).",

We ordered the stracciatella on a recommendation from a friend.  The cheese was fresh and gooey and delicious with the fresh, toasted bread.  We were similarly not disappointed by the arugula salad.  We were eating light, so we both got flatbreads, which we enjoyed: the meatball and ricotta and the arugula and prosciutto.  In the past we've had the shortribs, sea bass and a seafood risotto special and have enjoyed it all (with the exception of one misstep: my husband ordered the quail once and found it tasty, but too small for an entree).   The atmosphere is relaxed, the service is always good and the food is always delicious.  We will definitely come back!",

    "text": "Dear Sienna Sulla Piazza, you are delicious. Thank you for making my mouth water.  Okay so maybe that's not quite how this review is gonna go but its pretty damn close. Anyway, I've been to Sienna twice already for lunch and I can say both experiences have been great. My server/bartender the first time was amazing. I can't remember what her name was but all the suggestions she gave were spot on. Plus, she let me try some fun wines that she thought I might like. That visit I had their meatball and ricotta flatbread, greens and beans, and their cheese plate. Id highly recommend their Greens & Bean. It's not a large portion but what you get is extremely delicious. Their meatball & ricotta flatbread pizza wasn't half bad either. Not my favorite but definitely worth a try if you want to get a little craaaazy pizza wise.  My second visit I went with Tessa M. We decided to sit at the bar for lunch and snack on yet again for me but for Tessa her first time the meat plate (i can't help it if I like meat and cheese), the two fist sized meatball stuffed with a little sliver of cheese (i wish there was more), and both the pulled pork BBQ sandwich and tuna melt. Personally I don't like tuna and I don't think I ever will so I wasn't a fan of said melt. But the pulled pork on the other hand was delicious full of flavour and a bit of tang. Tessa might say the reverse but I can't help what I like.   We could've opted for dessert but alas we're tiny women so we can only stuff our faces so much. At the end of the day it was definitely a satisfying visit. I'm looking forward to trying more scrumptious bites here!",

    "text": "The hubby and I went here before the opera on a Friday night after not being able to get into Nola and we were really happy that we did.  I started out with a glass of reisling which was definitely on the sweet side.  Since I love sweet wine, I was in heaven.  WE then ordered two apps - the mushroom bruschetta and the crab cake.  We order crab cakes almost everywhere we go, so there is a lot of comparisons that happen.  This one lone crab cake was definitely not high on the list of the best - it was too small, not that fantastic of a flavor.  However, it was served with an awesome lemon and basil sauce that complimented it well.  The mushroom brushetta had fresh tomatoes, a pile of arugula and interesting mushrooms covering the grilled bread.  It was amazing!  A great combination of flavors and the grilled bread really added to the flavor.    For the main course, I had the butternut squash ravioli and a veal meatball.  J had the pork chop.  When my plates came, the meatball was about the size of my head and was covered in marinara.  All of it was delicious.  The meatball was perfectly cooked, had just the right amount of mozzarella inside and the tomato sauce was sweet, but not too sweet.  The butternut squash was interesting.  I think that for such a delicate flavor, you need a thin, not strongly flavored  dough.  Unfortunately, this one was very al dente and too thick.  Also, there wasn't really enough butternut squash in the ravioli for my taste.  What I did taste was fantastic, but there wasn't really enough filling.  The sauce was a thin sauce, not really sure what it was, but it was really good with the ravioli.  It was topped with tomatoes and braised short ribs that were awesome.  J's pork chop was moist and flavorful.  It was served on a bed of pulled pork.  It was interesting and different and he loved it.  Sadly, we didn't have enough time for dessert.  But we will definitely be back.",

Our server was a cool dude, and suggested we try a really awesome Zinfandel by the glass, which I think were maybe $8 per. This visit split the Octopus Antipasti which was a star, and the Meatball and Ricotta flatbread which may be the best of the two or three others that I've tried on different visits.

We grabbed two seats at the bar and perused the menu. My boyfriend ordered a Sangria (he was not impressed) however I drank the Rosemary Lemon Drop (he loved that though) and the first one I had was good but the second one (made by a different bartender) was hands-down 100% the best cocktail I have had in a very long time! My boyfriend ordered the braised rabbit,which is actually what I wanted, however I decided upon the prosciutto &arugula flatbread. That way I could taste his rabbit and he could try the flat bread.The braised rabbit was one of the best tasting entrees I have ever had at a restaurant! It was cooked very tender and was not \"gamey\", the sauce tasted as if it had wine in it, was creamy but not overly so-it was just amazing! The flatbread was surprisingly very good as well. It was a little overly salted, however, not so much so that it distracted from the other flavors.And it was very evident that all ingredients in both dishes were very fresh and authentic. The bill was a little higher than we would have liked. In particular the Rosemary Lemon Drops were $10 each which is steep, however, the second one I drank (and I don't believe I have said this in a long time) truly was worth $10 based on taste and presentation. Overall, I am excited to go back and try another entree besides the flatbread.I think next time I will order a rabbit entree for myself, even if my boyfriend gets it again, because it was just.that.good.",

Hubby had the Chianti braised beef and it was so tender and incredible... fell apart on his fork. Superb. Excellent. Marvelous.  Very hip, intimate, sexy. Will be back!",

The swordfish entree was both visually appealing and an absolute delight. A precise mix of saltiness with the slight acidity of the lemon, combined with the wine reduction sauce was perfectly married together. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting from out of town.",

    "text": "This is a really strong 4 out of 5 more, not quite 5 but essential a 4.5.  For appetizer I had the Chicken Liver Mousse.  Im a big chopped liver fan and this was fantastic.  They give you these large texas toast like pieces of tuscan bread and a large servings of their chicken liver mousse which is finished with honey and pistachios.  It was such a nice light texture, not grainy or chunky in the slightest.  Great unusual start to the meal.     For an entree I had the chinati braised short rib.  This was a venture to me because i never had tried short rib but am a big Osso Buco fan so i figured it was worth a try with the waiters recommendation.  He was so right, extremely tender, pot roast like taste but chianti braising was phenomonal.  Portion size was a little small and I felt the orzo mac and cheese had a very light taste that didnt do much for the dish.  The short rib itself was something I would come back for alone.  Very nice atmosphere and beautiful restaurant to dine in during the summer as the entire seating area benefits from their garage style lifted entrance. Will definitely be back.",

I took one bite and felt mush in my mouth, they were completely raw inside.  My friend cut one of hers open and also raw.  When I told our server she said they are served medium rare, who serves a veal and pork ground meatball medium rare? No apology took them backed to be cooked more.  Well the cooks cut all the meatballs open to finish cooking them defeating the purpose of having cheese stuffed inside since it then all cooked out.  When they were brought back to our table by the manager he just said \"here\" and put them on the table.  Will never be back!",

First impression of the restaurant is that it is located in a central, hip area on Market Square.  You can easily go for drinks at a bar in Market Square before or after your meal here.  My first impression walking into the restaurant is that it is a lot smaller than i thought.  It has a large bar with high top tables along with the rest of the tables.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us immediately (the wait staff is also very professional and attentive).  The one thing that I did not like was the amount of space between the tables.  We were seated near the bar, so we had people standing near our table, and my wife seat was backed up against the seat of the occupied table behind us.  I got a spicy old fashioned drink which was excellent and a blue cheese salad which was excellent.  For the main dish I got linguini carbonara which was top notch, made al dente, which is my favorite.  Also go for a meatball on the side (it has mozzarella inside of it!).  One added incentive for me is the cool music that was playing, which was mostly 90's rock music.  I go to Pittsburgh annually so I would 100% go back here.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "So I called to make reservations for lunch at Bella Serra in Market Square and discovered upon my arrival that they were now Sienna.  The good news:  great location, some nice outside seating, and a fairly small indoor area that has a nice, rustic Italian feel.  The bad news: service was a little slow during lunch and it took forever for someone to take our order.  Also, I ordered the margherita flat bread.  It was piled high with finely chopped basil, which I love, but the edges of the crust were way overcooked and impossible to cut through let alone bite through while the center of the flat bread was way too soggy.   They seemed to use canned or at least marinated tomatoes.  As a result, there was a ton of sauce/liquid, which made the bread so soggy in the middle.  I think they would have been way better off with thinly sliced fresh tomatoes.    Having said this, I'd like to go back and try something else off the menu to see if that is any better.  The styling on the plates of the other guests looked appealing and it looked like a good wine list.  I'm thinking I may just have ordered the wrong thing.",

I say \"one for lunch,\" the hostess says \"all I can do right now is a table outside.\" I really don't understand why I was forced to sit outside at a wobbly table on a slanted sidewalk when there were literally no other customers. I order the eggplant parm, then sit at my table outside in the chilly air for 25 minutes. As I'm about to leave, the waiter brings my eggplant parm, which is gigantic, but overcooked, greasy, and tough. How do you make eggplant tough? I complained, the waiter got the manager, he asked me if there was something wrong with my chicken parm. I said it was eggplant, I waited for it for a long time, it's tough and chewy, he apologized profusely and asked if he could package anything up for me, but I was really turned off at that point and just left. Walking back I thought that maybe it had been overcooked chicken parm, and that's why it was so tough; I called the restaurant and asked the manager, and he said no, it was eggplant, but I really can't help but think they served chicken to someone who ordered a vegetarian dish.  Maybe I just got a poorly-cooked plate. But please don't make me sit outside when there are plenty of tables. It felt like shame seating for people eating alone. And if food is taking long (25 minutes for lunch?), some acknowledgment or reassurance would be nice.",

We had reservations and were seated straight away. The server was very attentive the whole night and he suggested delicious drinks! I had an agave tequila cocktail and it was so uniquely delicious! We ordered a few appetizers, four main courses and two deserts. All of them were delicious and they came out at what seemed like perfect timing. My favorite of all that I tried was the pork chop. It was juicy and perfectly cooked.   I would reccomend this place for anyone- from a romantic night with your significant other to a relaxed night with family!

Had been here before for lunch and dinner and you always get amazing service not only from your server, but also the hostess and other people who work there. They treat you like family and not only care about your experience but you as a person.  As I walked over for work, Skylar was very friendly and did a nice job of keeping her company, which was very sweet. Our waiter was great too, but unfortunately I can't remember his name. Most restaurants don't put enough emphasis on service, but to me it makes or breaks an experience.   I had the homemade bucatini (pasta) and meatballs stuffed with mozzarella. Both were very good. The meatballs were the best. The mozzarella was oooey gooey, which is exactly what you want. The pasta was ok, but I felt like there wasn't enough of it. For $16, I want more than a few fork twists of pasta. I'm sure they're trying to make the meatball the star, but I think they should have given me more pasta.   My friend had an Old Fashioned, which she loved. However, $13.50 was a little extreme for a small glass. She really enjoyed her arugula salad and it looked delicious. She also had the tuna sandwich, which she said was delicious. I'd definitely want to try it the next time.   Definitely go check it out. The service alone is worth it plus as an added bonus, they have great food.",

Okay, that second one sounds weird, but it wasn't.  They were both amazing and highly recommended.    Service, ambience, all excellent.

I've been back a couple times, and I think it would be hard for any restaurant to live up to that kind of ridiculously romanticized garbally-goop. But they do a great job trying!

My fiance got the beef special they had and we weren't too impressed with that either. It was cooked well done and in my opinion that ruins most types of meat (unless you specifically request that which we did not). It also was a smaller portion that they charged over $50 for.

Sienna On The Square is on Market Square which was hosting the first night of a wonderful Christmas Market as well as a tree lighting.  Needless to say, the area was extremely busy and there were no tables to be had at Sienna On The Square but the hostess helped us snag to spots at the bar.  We had just made it in time for happy hour so we took advantage of the great deals and ordered flat bread and oysters along with a glass of wine all for a great deal!  They had a special drink to celebrate the festive evening -- a warm cider with a shot of whiskey!  Delicious!  The bartenders took excellent care of us and we were very happy that we found such a charming spot!",

Our waitress checked in with us enough and helped us decide on orders when we were indecisive. She definitely knew her stuff and could offer extra info and sound recommendations.  Also, they were a bit stingy with bread though... my friends really liked the pear-hummus spread but they didn't seem to want to give us more? Even though the food took a bit to come out.   FOOD - I can only speak for the Truffle Gnocchi, but OH MY this is the best gnocchi pasta I've ever had. The sauce was delicious, savory, just woodsy enough with the truffle. There were at least 4 different kinds of mushroom, all of which went so well with the duck confit and dark sauce. The chives were a little strange, but added great green color to the dish. Good portion, wasn't too full but very satisfied after.   VENUE - sat at a long table with benches near their garage door opening. So nice! It was a beautiful day out and we got to see the sun set a bit. Inside is quite dark, but super clean and rustic-feeling.   Overall, a little pricier than I'd like for pastas in Pittsburgh, but I mean it was delicious!",

For a $24 entree, I expected more than four small pieces of ravioli and a small amount of duck (barely noticeable).

The fact that its a smaller venue, takes reservations, and has a simple menu for quick choices makes this a great joint to have a conversation at (barring the around average noise levels for a lunch rush establishment).  The chicken parm sandwich is great, but definitely a stomach bomb (it'll require coffee afterwards to not need rolled into work afterwards) and the flatbreads a decent as well.  Judging by other's reviews, I wouldn't mind checking out their dinner service, but I doubt I'll get to that soon.",

    "text": "2.5 stars, leaning towards a 2 based on the price.  Went on a Wednesday night at 7, with reservations.  Got there fifteen early, got seated on time.  The front of the restaurant is *loud*; with a waiter talking to the table next to us and a somewhat unpleasant pair on the other side of us, the noise was a factor here.  Got much better when the waiter wasn't dealing with anyone.  Anyways, it's a loud restaurant.  That's by no means a dealbreaker, and really common for Downtown.  Crowd was mixed, the most represented group there when we were in were 50-something guys wearing polo shirts, half tucked into khakis.  The food: - I had the pork, which was decent, my wife had the gnocchi, which was good, but more doughy instead of melt-in-your-mouth. - We had the bruschetta, which we were told took 12 minutes.  (Weird to be that precise, but OK).  Some other waiter/waitress apparently swiped ours... so it took nearly half an hour, as our waiter thought someone had already brought it to us. - Salads were good; aces. - My wife asked for a meatball with her gnocchi, which they forgot; it came about ten minutes late, and warm, but not hot, which left us wondering if they finished cooking it.  The meatball?  Not all that. - Portions were fine dining, and not red-sauce-stuff-your-gullet; I liked the portions, and left pleasantly full.    Service: - good, but with us having a very quick set of orders when we sat down, it took 45 minutes to get the first of our food... which was an hour after we first showed up.  Ouch.  So, the food was decent, but not as good as some other places around town at the same (or lower!) price points.  Either the service or the kitchen botched this one, and for \"restaurant of the year\" and at a premium price... yeah, that sinks it.  (We spent $100 after tip; two entrees, two salads, one appetizer, no booze.)  For better red sauce Italian, I'd try Lydia's in the Strip, and save a bit of money.  For better Italian, especially gnocchi, I'd go to Dish Osteria in the South Side, and still save a bit of money.  If I hear good things, I'd be glad to check back here, but we left disappointed on our first trip.",

I could not resist. It was just as delicious, juicy, and sweet as it was last time. Yum. My husband ordered the veal meatballs. I never would have ordered the meatballs. I'm not a big meatball fan. Nonetheless, I am NOW. Loved the veal meatballs, gooey cheese, pignoli nuts served with a bright, fragrant, fresh, and sassy tomato sauce. Double yum. I was tempted to order meatballs to go.  Sadly, my sweet corn lobster risotto was not on the menu. In its place is lobster risotto made with zucchini. I like the menu evolving with fresh seasonal ingredients although disappointed that their website menu states they still have the sweet corn risotto which is why my disappointment lingered.   I was also disappointed to see cheese thrown on my plate and hanging off the side. Really? Is the expeditor sick today? Nevertheless, the dish tasted great. Another perfect al dente risotto coupled with grilled tomatoes and cubed zucchini. Everything tasted delicious but I will confess I am unsure the zucchini did anything for the dish. The sweet corn on the previous preparation added an undeniable sweet profile- the zucchini..not so much. Nevertheless, I practically licked my plate clean as I love the remaining flavors.  My husband had the papperdelle bolognese. Another dish served with food seeping down the side of the plates. Aesthetics aside- Wow! Another delicious and flavorful dish. I loved this. The noodles were fresh and soft bathed in a rich and complex tasting bolognese. Every ingredient was present and required. Lovely dish I would recommend highly.   Lastly- the chef's tasting menu. I asked our waiter what today's tasting was and he said whatever the chef decides. Yes, I get that hence the name. But what has chef decided today? Still fumbling by the waiter. Hmm. Not sure if this is the impression that the restaurant is seeking to make but I never do blind tastings. The only chef's tastings I have seen and partaking in were able to tell me before ordering what I would be receiving today.  It's a shame they lost out on making more money from me and who knows how many others if they would just explain it daily.",

My husband and I walked in spontaneously and sat down at the bar five minutes before the end of happy hour, and the bartender gave us MAJOR attitude when we ordered off the HH menu.  (Chill, dude! Five minutes is five minutes!  The next round will be full price!)  We also split a flatbread and an appetizer, and there was really nothing special about it at all.  The chef was watching us eat from the kitchen door and he made me feel guilty for not enjoying the food.  I also had to ask for them to turn their one television to the Pens game, and got attitude for that request as well. (It's a hockey night!!  This is Pittsburgh!!)

For the rest of the meal I tried their restaurant week offering (Salad, Pasta, and Dessert).  The salad was simple and fresh, but not memorable. The pasta was well made, in a very traditional execution. I guess I was hoping for something a little more unique and with a little flair (like their flatbread). For desert I chose the zeppoli. Sadly they were somewhat small, so they lacked the moist inside I expect from a zeppoli.   This was a Yelp get together, so of course we discussed the meal. Out of seven diners the consensus around the table seemed to be that the meal would best be rated a 3.25, but until Yelp lets us do fractions of a star, it'll have to be a 3.",

    "text": "I can truly say with out a doubt that I've NEVER had a bad experience at Sienna. Last week on Valentine's Day was the best.   It was my fifth experience at Sienna fourth for dinner. We were greeted with smiles from hostess and manager, Mike. Seated immediately and greeted again by, Matthew.   First, I'd like to thank Chef Porco for hiring such an attentive, knowledgeable staff. Particularly, Matthew. His attention to detail of the menu was very impressive (and we love the French accent!). Our first order was an Italian Montepulciano for $40.  We decided on three courses...the anchovy crostini and the mussels arrabiata. Both very flavorful and yummy. I almost forgot about the homemade bread with white bean spread flavored with truffle and olive oil. Yummy!  The mesculan salad may seem simple but the kalamata olives, whipped goat cheese and red pepper vinaigrette just made it a much greater experience for the taste buds.  It was difficult to choose the last course. I'm a big fan of their meatballs and I knew I couldn't resist. So the Bucatini with their signature mozzarella stuff meatballs (size of baseballs) won! My sweetheart ordered my second choice, the Lamb Osso Buco...a large delectable portion of meat with mashed potatoes and carrots. As decent and fair minded Americans, we, of course, shared plates (thanks sweetie!). All courses were delicious and unique. The lamb tender, falling off bone. The meatballs melt in your mouth. We did not leave with a doggie bag.  Kudos to Sienna for your efforts to ensure that the service, food, and atmosphere is unique, fun, and delicious. I hope more restaurants can use you as a benchmark, particularly with service and knowledge of food and wine.",

    "text": "I like to think of Sienna on the Square as one of my first True Pittsburgh meals. I ventured over to Market Square the evening after moving to Pittsburgh, desperate to find a quality restaurant for a good meal with my parents. We stumbled upon Sienna and decided to give it a try. It was around 6pm on a weekday but already full, so we put our name in with the hostess and walked around outside for awhile. We then sat at the bar and had a drink. After 30 minutes of waiting (and a few tables opening up), the bartender went out of her way to check with the hostess to get us seated. We were very impressed with this service and were seated outside on a lovely evening.   The meal itself was delicious. Our waitress was knowledgable and able to provide suggestions to us. We started with the mozzarella stuffed meatballs and YUM! I could make a meal out of those meatballs and a glass of wine. For entrees, we tried the mafalde bolognese, linguine and clams, and one of the pasta specials for the day. Everything tasted great  and was quite filling - the portions can definitely feed you for more than one meal!   I'm glad I visited Sienna on one of my first nights living in this city. It made a lasting impression on me and I look forward to returning on another special occasion.",

I ordered the butternut squash soup (amazing!!) as well but I was then too full to finish my meal. It has made for great leftovers though! We sat by a couple from Ohio who said Sienna on the Square is their favorite restaurant in pittsburgh! Great date night spot. We will definitely be back!",

I ordered the sea scallops, which were swimming in a rich, creamy sauce. The scallops were seared perfectly and the smokey pork belly was a great accompaniment to the flavors.   My dining partner order their take on spaghetti and meatballs: buccatini with cheese stuffed meatballs. The sauce was flavorful and authentic. The meatballs appeared undercooked, though when the server was asked, it was explained that the pink color was due to the concentration of veal. The flavor of the meatballs was very delicious, no doubt due to that blend of meats.   We ended the meal with the chocolate cake, which was incredibly rich and had a nice dark chocolate flavor. The cherry sauce tasted a lot like cough medicine, but the dessert was perfectly fine without it--so order the cake, but skip the sauce.   I highly recommend stopping by for happy hour, when discounts on drinks are paired with cheap bites (mussels for $7!). Overall, a great spot on Market Square.",

The high tops were replaced by booths and the dark wooden tables in the lower level were gone, replaced by light colored versions. The place looks clean and refreshed, but I'm not ready to call it improved. There were also some minor menu changes that were inconsequential and unnecessary in my opinion. We had the excellent free bread, lemon pasta, and halibut with rice. The food was very good and the service was excellent. The wine list has been updated and improved. Even though it is early April it was warm enough to sit outside and most the tables out there were occupied. I don't find their sidewalk seating attractive and prefer to be inside, closer to the bar. To summarize, Sienna is still a cosy but no longer dark,  limited menu Italian place that's worth a trip to the big city.",

    "text": "Came here during restaurant week and had their three course meal. We started off with the tomato bisque, which was nice and creamy but not too heavy. For the main course, I had the lemon pepper spaghetti with shrimp. It had a spinach pesto sauce with a little bit of heat from the shishito peppers. The sauce was delicious! All their pastas are made in house. My friends had the gnocchi and the lamb gemelli and they both enjoyed their meals as well. For dessert, I had the panna cotta with turmeric and raspberry jam and pistachios. It was a very unique dessert and a nice and light way to finish the meal. Overall, it was a quality Italian meal. The prices are definitely on the higher side, but I would come back for their pastas.",

    "text": "Sienna missed the mark for me. My favorite part of the meal was definitely the Sienna chopped salad I had before my meal. It was fresh and perfectly dressed with a generous amount of Gorgonzola on top and the most delicious croutons.   For my main dish I ordered the bucatini with the mozzarella stuffed meatballs. The bucatini was definitely homemade and very doughy and filling. The meatballs were overcooked and lacked flavor. It was a disappointing dish. My husband ordered the roast chicken, and he gave me his hush puppies. I was sooo excited to eat them, but they also lacked flavor and were just average. His chicken was very flavorful though. We came with a large group of 10 and no one was wowed by their food.  Maybe I'll be back to try a different dish. The jury is still out on Sienna.",

We were looking for delicious food with a fun environment. We decided to take a Lyft right into Market Square. We were automatically compelled to go into Sienna on the Square. I vaguely remember it being there the last time I was in town but I never got a chance to try it. To our pleasant surprise, we were able to walk right in on a Saturday night around 8:30 PM with no reservation and got a table right by the window so we could simultaneously people watch. It was a little bit cold, but it was worth it for the fun environment. We were approached by our server, Eric, right away who took our drink orders. I got my classic martini and my sister ordered a craft cocktail, or two. He brought out bread and our salad came out before our cocktails. We split the chopped salad, gnocchi, and the special which was salmon. It was delicious, healthy, and well balanced. Our cocktails were delicious, the salmon itself was delicious and had a heavy glaze on it, the gnocchi was sinfully delicious, and the salad was yummy too. We like sharing so we can taste everything. The portions were perfect for sharing, and our service was excellent. If ever in Pittsburgh again, I'm going straight to Sienna.",

    "text": "WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD.  I am not exaggerating in the least bit.  The series of events that occurred in the hour and 20 minutes we were here completely put a negative damper on the rest of my family's night  Let me preface this by saying that as a higher-end restaurant in a downtown area, located near the all the theaters, a place like this should check to show schedules and plan and staff accordingly.  Obviously the place was understaffed because we were not the only ones getting up from their tables to complain to the manager.    Because I took into account that it would be a busy night in the area, I scheduled far ahead and made a nice reservation.  We got there promptly at 6 and were all delighted by the beautiful decor.  I knew we may run into a problem when we all knew what we wanted before anyone even greeted us at our table because we sat there for a little under 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us at the table.    Regardless, quarter after 6 rolls around, and we place our orders completely: appetizers, salad, and main entrees.  It took a while for the appetizers to come out, but I thought maybe that was just this place's take on the classic \"take your time\" Italian setting, which I am not opposed to.  So, I was fine waiting a little bit so our table actually had the time to talk.  Once the appetizers did arrive, I was a little shocked at the portion.  There were just about 3 bites of greens and beans to go around for $8 and the beans weren't even cooked enough... I mean what I had was delicious, but since we all shared a couple appetizers, I only had one bite.  Same with the octopus: served atop of the most beautiful plate.  It looked elegant, but it was pretty measly.  However, I understand the smaller portion of octopus because it's obviously a more expensive ingredient than the greens that go into making greens and beans.  I digress...  Another 15 mins goes by, then finally the wedge salad that my parents ordered arrived.  Now this wedge salad was the best part of our meal.  In fact, it was damn near delectable.  But it was soon easily overshadowed by my hunger and the look around the dining area to see many people waiting for their meals.  At this point I started to get nervous: it was getting close to show time, and I could feel that our food was no where near ready to arrive to our table.  No less, I felt optimistic when we asked our waiter after another 10 mins when our meals would be coming.  He responded, \"well, it won't be 20 minutes, maybe more like 5 or a few.\"  He gave the excuse that the cook is bringing the food out in the order it came into the kitchen.  Well, bullshit because the gentlemen who came in 20 mins after we ordered complained about their meals running late, and soon after their plates arrived.  **FUNNIEST MOMENT OF THE NIGHT: At this point the manager came over, saw our empty table, and stack of appetizer plates, and asked how our meals were!  You kidding, I almost killed over.  This is when he then told us the \"there's a show, and we are running behind\" excuse.    I am sorry, but when I plan ahead and make a reservation because I am so excited to eat at this place and start my night off right, the last thing I want to hear are these dumb excuses and being told to just wait a little longer is even worse.  It was 15 minutes to show time.  We had officially been sitting there at this restaurant for an hour and fifteen minutes.  It was time to throw in the towel, and hurry and make our way to the show.  My father asked our waiter for the check for everything we had eaten and told him we were leaving.  Well, he brought the check, and GUESS WHAT, it had all the entrees on it!    Instantly, my mother jumped up, and I never let my mother get mad in public, especially at a restaurant in the restaurant setting.  I never think its cool to yell at a staff member or a manager, but this time was different.  This was easily the worst restaurant experience I had ever had.  What's worse is that I was so excited to eat here.  I had spent time looking at the menu the week before and getting excited about what dish I was going to eat.  When my mom went and talked to the manager, he had his face planted on the kitchen computer screen.  She told him our series of events and how it was ridiculous, and then she said we were leaving and she asked how much we owed for what we had eaten so far, and he said he didn't want anything.  At least at this point I left with some respect for the guy that he didn't fire back or state that he wanted the $25 for the food we ate.    As we left, I was so upset.  Like I said, I had been looking forward to this night for the past 6 months, and I was extremely excited about trying this place after I had read all the reviews.  I was very upset with the way the night ended.  Sadly I will probably never be back, and every time I am near Market Square or think of that night and show, this poor experience will be in the back of my mind.",

Dining outdoors at the Market Square on a warm summer afternoon - it's great as it is. I like the menu, it's not too lengthy but offers a nice variety to choose from. Great service; they bring you free bread. (the one reason I didn't give them all 5 stars is that they don't have butter. Instead it's bean paste that comes with the bread and it wasn't all that great. I want my bread to come with butter, please!) The rest of the menu items we ordered were great! The flat breads are delicious; salads all look good.  The raspberry tiramisu on the desert menu is a must! Overall, good food, great service and great atmosphere.",

On my first visit the entire restaurant was reserved for lunch including three seats at the bar.  Impressive me thinks yes.  Sienna Sulla Piazza is a small 14 seater restaurant but obviously it's beloved by many for it to be booked solid for lunch!  From the first sip of my prosecco I knew that I was in good hands. The chef even brought the food out to me himself. The greens and beans were so flavorful and cooked with stewed fresh tomatoes and were served with grilled bread. I also ordered a Ceasar salad. To my surprise the anchovies in the salad where actually fresh not canned! After realizing this I knew things were done way differently at Sienna Sulla Piazza. Even though I was stuffed to the gills I just had to taste a dessert.  I got the raspberry tiramisu. It was so good I felt, gluttonously naughty eating it.  On my second visit I had the Mediterranean olives and gilled octopus.  The octopus was topped with roasted red peppers and oh so tender. Sienna is apparently chef owned, which the bartender explained makes a world of difference in how the food is prepared.    Bonus the bartenders are super friendly!",

I wasn't super hungry, so I just ordered a salad with the marinated olives as an appetizer.  I've been back three times since, and here's why -   The salads are the perfect portion, and they are AMAZINGLY priced.  They also offer interesting flavor combinations in the different salads. The olives are just too yummy.  I've ordered them every time, and they are always different.  Love that. The white bean paste with garlic and truffle oil they serve with the bread is out of this world.  I could eat just that for my meal and be totally satisfied.    Sienna is a great addition to Market Square.  Eventually I'll be back to try an entree, but I'm so in love with the salads, I haven't got past them yet!",

Each item i have tried is fragrant with so many textures and tastes that it makes my tastes buds dance. I came here for dinner and started with the octopus antipasti, which had just the right balance of lightness of arugula and richness of its sauce. I am a born and bred New Englander and know my seafoods, so i was skeptical to try their Seafood Gemelli. However, it exceeded my expectations! Sienna's homemade pasta, cooked perfectly aldente, adds a new texture that you don't get from regular pasta. The lobster sauce it came in was aromatic with so many flavors and was balanced perfectly by the other vegetables in it. The only negative I can think of is that the restaurant seemed very dark and the music didn't fit the mood i wanted for a nice dinner. Overall, I left Sienna with a happy stomach and an empty wallet. I would do it all again.",

Nice wine offerings and our server seemed to be knowledgeable about them.  We both had classic caesar salads, which were fine.  I ordered the quatro formaggio flat bread and my husband ordered bucatini with mozzarella-stuffed veal meatballs.  Both dishes looked great, but turned out to be woefully overcooked.  The flat bread crust was as hard as a boxed pretzel and it lacked overall flavor (aside from too much salt)  as well as any basil as listed on the menu.  My husband's dish arrive unnecessarily steaming, which may explain why the marinara had a brownish tone, yet tasted old.  He said the meatballs were just okay, not great.  Maybe it was an off night.  The bill was reasonable, so maybe we'll give it another shot some day.",

It looks like a former street level garage, with all brick walls/floors and low ceiling, which was wisely converted into the upscale, Italian spot. I liked the vibe and feel of it almost immediately.  After looking over the various menu options, I decided on the Homemade Sausage sandwich with a side of pasta salad. Sometimes this can be a risky order in some places, not knowing the consistency or spiciness of the meat. Neither was an issue as the sausage was tender, not fatty, and seasoned perfectly, not too bland or too hot. I just wished there was more of it or a smaller accompanying bun. The pasta salad was also good compliment side dish, pretty standard.  The bartender was somewhat apathetic, maybe battling a case of The Mondays, but this was a pretty solid place otherwise.",

The red skinned potatoes are perfection, the goat cheese salad perfection. bread and red pepper hummus dip superb.  Nikki was a perfect waitress, tending to my every need  The 4 drinks i had were handcrafted and marvelous and I am very very picky about drinks.  The ginger beer drink was perfectly presented in a copper mug. They infuse their own syrups or ginger beer.  The lemon drop rosemary martini was next to my favorite.  The cucumber lavender was as drinkable as kool aid  the exotic tequila and carrot drink was very nice and pretty  FLatbreads are very crispy and will not dissapoint.  I hope they keep up the good work. This is about the only 5 star I ever gave a pittsburgh establishment. I cant wait to go back  This is serious eating. NO weekend chefs working here. THis is fine dining. Portions are high quality and small so dont be expecting huge piles of garbage like other places serve  you get what you pay for!!!    OH, the chocolate lava cake was bar none.",

My party was promptly seated and served on a Wednesday night by a pleasant french man.  Each of our dishes were quite flavorful, however my roasted quail was clearly the showstopper.  Succulent, tender and incredibly tasty, the saucy combination of brussel sprouts with walnuts and bacon with just a touch of rosemary was quite impressive.  Other winners at the table were the enormous veal meatballs and the butternut squash ravioli (although the portion size was small).  The papperdelle bolognese stood out as bland in comparison to the other entrees I tried.  Although small inside, Sienna has a beautifully dark atmosphere and is absolutely a great restaurant for a night out on the town or after a show.  One of the better eateries in market square if one is willing to fork over a few extra dollars for a memorable experience.",

Leaving that incident aside, I met up with a friend last evening at the bar area and again had a bad experience. Also, they were the first restaurant I have seen in Pittsburgh to charge me two bucks for ice to go along with my whiskey! Thanks but no thanks!",

    "text": "I ate here for dinner late this past Thursday night with my girlfriend.  We were downtown already and decided to see what was open in Market Square at a later time on a weeknight.  I actually was unaware that this restaurant was even there since the last time I had walked by it had been Bella Serra, but boy am I glad that it is.  The inside of the restaurant is not too much different from the previous restaurants here with the brick walls showing and some art.  They did add a rolling door to the front that allows it to be open to Market Square.  For dinner I decided to have the strazzopreti & wild mushrooms with a side of orzo mac & cheese while my girlfriend went with the tomato bisque and a poached pear salad.  We asked that it all be brought out together and within a reasonable time period it was.  My strazzopreti and mushrooms consisted of the pasta, an assortment of mushrooms, spinach and onions in a cream sauce while my mac and cheese looked pretty non descript.  At first I was unsure of how I would like my pasta, but wow, was it good.  The pasta seemed fresh and was cooked al dente giving it just a slightly different texture than the large number of mushrooms that it was paired with.  Overall it had a nice earthy flavor that I thoroughly enjoyed.   After finishing my pasta I moved onto my mac & cheese.  It might very well have been the best mac and cheese that I have ever eaten at a restaurant.  It was very rich and creamy and you could actually taste the mixture of different cheeses.  I only wished that there would have been pepper on the table to cut into some of the richness of it.  While I was eating all of this my girlfriend was also enjoying her meal.  I was able to taste her poached pear salad, specifically the roasted garlic mascarpone port vinaigrette and it was extremely tasty.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  I went in without any expectations and it and it totally blew me away and so I am looking forward to trying some more of the chefs creations.",

There wasn't anything horrible about the place, at least not for us, but it certainly didn't leave me wanting more. Some of the other reviews complain about the price of the food for what you get; and I sort of agree. The greens and beans appetizer is 9 for what the waitress called \"a very small bowl\", and she was not kidding. On the other hand I got a grilled chicken sandwich that came with pasta salad (or chips) for $11 and I felt I got what I paid for. I was a decent sized chicken sandwich, with a nice sized bowl of pasta salad.  The taste of the food is the same way. Once again, my chicken sandwich was pretty good. It came on a nice focaccia bread with a fancy aioli and (I think) provolone cheese. I was not a fan of the pasta salad though; it had a funny spice that I was not fond of. Erin loved it though, so.... And if you are a beans and greens lover, these are not the usual. There was sausage and chunks of tomato, which as an Italian I had never seen before, and very little actual greens. It wasn't bad, just not what one expects ordering beans and greens. A large part of the menu looks like wine and cocktails, but I don't drink so I'm no help there.  I don't know, it was just kind of eh.",

It was good, don't get me wrong - it's not that I was...unhappy with my meal...but I wasn't so happy with it either. It could have, however, been the dish that I chose. I ordered a special that the waitress so kindly told us about...it was some sort of fish (and shame on me for not remembering the name of it), which sounded SO appealing -  served over a bed of sweet potato and fennel hash...but the fish itself was a bit too...fishy. It was a white, meaty fish, and the hash that it was served over was delicious...but ultimately the fishiness just, wasn't appealing. My arugula salad was awesome though - mixed with fennel and a light vinaigrette - such a tasty starter -  I never thought to put fennel in my salads and will definitely be making that for myself. The roasted red pepper spread that was served with the bread at the table was also great.  Though ultimately a little bummed with my main course, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was relaxing. Exposed brick walls always seduce me, and the friendly attentive staff was refreshing.   I sat at the bar for my first glass of wine - made it just in time for happy hour the bartender informed me, 5-7 on weekdays - half off wine - always a selling point for me :-)  I wouldn't be opposed to going back and giving this joint another shot.",

Neither of us had been to Sienna Sulla Piazza yet, and since we're always seeking out new dining experiences, we decided to check it out.   She made a reservation via Open Table for 12:15. We arrived promptly and were seated very quickly. The restaurant is smaller than I had anticipated but well decorated. I particularly loved the bar that has a beautifully lit wall highlighting the attached shelves filled with bottles.  Though I really wanted to try some of the pastas listed on the menu (the Ricotta Gnocchi and Beef Ravioli looked delightful), I thought that the prices were a bit steep for lunch. I really didn't want to spend $18 on an entree. Instead, I ordered the Classic Caesar Salad, and my friend and I split the Prosciutto & Arugula Flatbread. I am very picky about salads but enjoyed the Caesar. However, I do agree with Rachel C's review that the salad was a bit salty... even without the optional Anchovies. The pizza was descent but didn't blow me away. I felt like something was \"off\" when eating the pizza but couldn't quite put my finger on it. After having thought about it, I think that the classy prosciutto and arugula toppings did not match the more dive-pizza-joint style cheese, sauce, and crust.  I would definitely be open to checking out Sienna Sulla Piazza again to try some additional menu items. However, I think competitor Il Pizzaiolo right across Market Square - though more expensive for lunch - delivers better value for the money overall.",

I wasn't sure if I could handle real food, especially rich Italian food, but Sienna's Housemade Ricotta Wild Mushroom Gnocchi ($19), surprisingly, helped cure my hangover. I asked them not to include the pancetta. Fantastic gnocchi dish with gorgeous mushrooms.   John got his haircut earlier in the day, and the stylist told him that Sienna's food is great, but the portions are small. He ordered one of the vegetarian flatbreads and a side of brussel sprouts. Uhh, these portions are definitely NOT small at all. He ended up with way too much food! (Perhaps we're used to NYC portions?)  Great service, great food. Next time I'm in the 'burgh, I'd love to stop by to try more dishes and explore their extensive wine menu. Until next time, Sienna!",

Shame that such a lovely restaurant took such a dive into a lack luster establishment.",

    "text": "Marvelous food and excellent service.  Sienna is mostly a small plates restaurant with delicious Italian cuisine.  We shared a Beans & Greens appetizer that came with a Chianti reduction sauce that was delicious.  I had the homemade Gnocchi, which I am generally picky about, but these were fabulous.  My date had the Chicken Picatta, which was prepared with crimini mushroom, fried red skin potato, caper, lemon, and parsley.  Excellent.  Also, I got a mozzarella stuffed meatball that was very tasty.  Lovely outdoor dining that spills out into historic Market Square, I am recommending this restaurant very highly.",

The food is consistently very good, and although the hosts could be warmer to people when they walk in, the bartenders are GREAT (Amanda, Derek). The rest of the wait staff is good as well. The decor put me off when I first visited---it's kind of ugly and cliched---but the lighting makes up for it and creates a cozy ambiance. Overall, a very comfortable place.  Pretty much everything I've eaten there has been excellent, with just the occasional \"miss.\"  Last year, they offered an unusual rendition of chicken piccata, served on a ragu of chickpeas, that was incredibly good and sent me there more frequently than I visit now.  I keep hoping they'll bring it back.  Overall, a winner in the square.",

I had the Campanella and my husband had the Bolognese and  of course we started with the meatballs - ever bite was perfect. The seasoning and sauces were just right and the pasta was the perfect al dente, although for homemade pasta it could have been a little thinner and more delicate. The staff was great and we finished the meal with lemonchello. Having never been to Pittsburg and not sure about their dining scene- we were surprised and delighted by Sienna's and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a great meal!",

Some of the combinations on the menu look innovative, but in practice, there is a lot of stuff on the plate that doesn't really add to the flavor of the dishes.  My agnolotti didn't need 7 kinds of vegetables accompanying it when they were all mushy and flavorless.    The service is worse.  Our waiter was astoundingly condescending and unfriendly, explaining what tapas are and what bolognese sauce is - I guess we look like we think our idea of great Italian food is Pizza Hut -  and slow...it took on average 15 minutes to get each drink, not because the bar was busy but because he was standing at the end of it BS'ing.  The price of the meal was not in line with the amount or quality of the food we received.    In sum, this place is thriving in a downtown area with otherwise great restaurants, when it is on the level of a pretty good place in a far suburb.    For exceptional Italian food, walk 150 feet across Market Square and go to Il Pizzaiolo.",

I got two which ended up costing 7 bucks. A bit overpriced if you ask me.  The menu allows you to select a meatball consisting of different flavors and then let's you add a sauce or gravy. I got the spicy meatball with mushroom gravy. You can then turn it into a slider, sandwich, or eat the meatballs with the sauce/gravy. The flavors were there and the meatballs were good. My only complaint with the sliders is that is was not hot. Not even lukewarm! Disappointing for the price your paying.  We also ordered tater tots. They cooked them too long. My daughter had the mac and cheese. Cute little noodles but not a lot of flavor.  Overall one of the better meals on this trip. I would recommend it if you don't want to stuff yourself.",

After we paid, we were sitting there drinking our water and the hostess asked us to leave. She said they have a reservation for our table in a couple minutes. We were only at the restaurant for 45 minutes. It would've been nice if they told us ahead of time that there was a reservation at that table so we  knew.

    "text": "Love the atmosphere.  Unfortunately didn't really love the food as much...  We went during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week so we were able to sample a little taste of everything.  Add in a couple flatbreads and apps and we seriously did some damage to the menu!  Hearing that the flatbreads were the way to go, we choose the tomato and basil and prosciutto and arugula.  The winner was absolutely the prosciutto.  The tomato one fell very flat against the flavorful prosciutto.  We also ordered the stuffed hot banana peppers.  They also fell flat and didn't offer half as much flavor as this usually flavorful dish should.  Plus, they were uber tiny.  Literally two tiny peppers that were barely able to be split between two people.  I had the Caesar salad for the first course, which was way too salty.  I realize that it was probably \"authentic\" in the way they used anchovy, but it was overkill.  If you're ever looking for a killer Caesar head to Lidia's in the Strip, they know how to do it!    Second course was the Rigatoni and Shrimp.  The rigatoni was al dente, which I like.  The sauce was okay, but nothing special.  The shrimp was the standout of the meal.  It had three jumbo shrimp and all of them were fresh and delicious!  If those shrimp weren't included the dish would have been a letdown.    The third course I chose the cannoli duo.  I was really not impressed.  It was a grainy filling and I wasn't too into the lemon/chocolate chip combo. It left me craving a real dessert somewhere... hence drinking more afterwards:)  My dinning buddies all agreed it just wasn't a memorable food experience.  There's dishes I still think of because they were so good.  This joint is new, so hopefully they have a bit to work on some things... hopefully!",

We sat outside with our 2 dogs and they were very accommodating. The waitress was great, she even brought over a bowl of water for our dogs.  We started with the bread salad appetizer which was the best dish we had that night. Quite different than a normal house salad. It was very good.  For our entrees we split the mushroom flatbread and the mushroom ravioli. Both dishes were ok. Nothing bad however just felt they were both missing something. Can't quite put my finger on it but I've had better.  A couple complaints would be; the menu is pretty small and their vegetarian selection is even smaller, their food portions are very small as well, and their prices are high much too high for the quality and amount of food you get. Our bill came to almost $50 and all we ordered was 1 appetizer, 1 flatbread & 1 vegetarian pasta (no drinks, no alcohol). That's much to pricey for the food we got. I don't mind paying higher prices for food but I expect high quality and to maybe even leave the restaurant with some left overs.  I wouldn't worry about checking out Sienna, there's other Italian pizza/pasta restaurants around Pittsburgh that are much better.",

There is now an indifference that seems to permeate the entire waitstaff and bartenders. Almost just going through the motions. Any thought of putting the customer first has disappeared. But more importantly the quality of the meal has fallen. My lady friend and I stopped for a meal the other evening, a salad and snack with a glass of wine after the Penguins game. The snack being the Mozzarella stuffed Meatballs in Maranara Sauce. We waited a long time for them to arrive, over twenty minutes. And as we broke them apart with forks to eat we noticed two things. The were horribly undercooked, still rare in the middle....and there was mozzarella stuffing them. My lady friend and I sent them back and finished our salads as it was late and left. There are much better options in Pittsburgh at present.",

So when you read the reviews and see \"comfortable Italian restaurant\" don't be fooled like me, and check the menu first. It is an excellent restaurant for inventive Italian cuisine - just leave the kids at home ;)",

    "text": "We were lucky to grab a last minute reservation on a Saturday night and couldn't have asked for a better meal!  This wasn't my first trip to Sienna but it had been awhile.  Beautiful ambiance with the Christmas lights, our waiter was friendly and attentive, and the food was divine!  I wasn't sure I wanted a \"heavy\" pasta dish and I was pleasantly surprised by the light fluffy potato pockets, and the squash and braised rabbit and sprouts were so delicious it didn't even feel like a traditional pasta dish.  Best of all:  three entrees, one soup, one salad and a dessert, and a few glasses of wine and the bill was only $108. Oh...and there's valet parking...so the whole experience was fabulous.  I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "The pasta was wonderful and so were the meatballs I got.  I don't make it downtown often, so eating here was special and delicious.  I had my baby with me and they were very accommodating (she is a good baby so she wasn't any trouble to begin with!).  It had a great atmosphere too, fun place to catch up with my friend!    My only complaint is that it was a little salty, but I am not use to much salt in my diet so that is just me!!!  I would recommend this place to anyone!",

    "text": "Just stopped in here for a late lunch/early dinner.   The place is on the small size but that didn't matter to me as it was pretty empty for lunch.   As an appetizer, I had the sausage and bean soup. While it was just a tad more salty than I would have liked, the taste was amazing. The sausage and white beans combined to make this a hearty soup on a cold day here in Pittsburgh.   For my main meal I had the Bucatini, which comes with two mozzarella stuffed meatballs. This did was even more amazing. The pasta was cooked perfectly and it certainly tasted home made. The meatballs were out of this world!  They also tasted home made, but I'm not sure if they are. And the sauce that surrounded everything was absolutely delicious.   Overall, a fabulous experience and I would definitely come back here again.",

    "text": "Came in on a busy Wednesday night, sat at the bar. The bar is nice with comfortable seats . I also like the atmosphere here, with dim lighting and well docorated interior. I ordered a Miller light with a glass. This is the type of establishment where the bar tender pours it into the glass for you, which is nice. To eat I ordered the muscles. They were good, they were covered an orange creamy reduction with them that tasted like it had tomatoes in it. It also came with toast that was made on a grill giving it a nice flavor. Service was very friendly throughout my visit. I would come again.",
