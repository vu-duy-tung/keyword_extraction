The restaurant seemed busy, but we got our drinks, appetizers, and dinner very quickly. Beautiful view, the food was delicious, staff was very friendly, and prices are reasonable. I would recommend this place  to anyone who is looking for a night out on the water in Pittsburgh.",

Being that I gave Redfin 1 star this place gets a 3. Nothing fancy but the food was really good. The shrimp are huge and cooked just right. Burgers looked to be made fresh and the bacon was crisp. There were 5 of us and we all got something different and all enjoyed our meals. Service was a little slow. The restrooms are a little dirty and dated. The bar is nice and big with several games to play. It's a nice place to get better than average bar food and some drinks. We will be back soon",

    "text": "I booked an event two months in advance for a boat party of 110 people to dock at crow's for drinks and dancing. The night of the event we got held for 30 minutes up by river police due to fireworks at PNC Park for a Pirate game. 5-10 minutes from crows nest the manager texts me to inform me that they've decided to cancel the even because we were late, and they didn't want to be there past midnight. She also told me she didn't want to deal with a bunch of drunk people. While her patronizing presumptuousness frustrated me I assured her that no one was out of control and that we would cut our party short a half hour to accommodate her, and be gone by 12:30. They turned us away regardless. So after months of planning, and over $2K spent on chartering a yacht, we turned the boat around. A friend who sat at their bar awaiting our arrival told management that we were a well behaved crowd of young professionals who intended to spend a lot of money, but they held to their ignorant assumptions. He left disgusted.   It gets worse...  The following Monday I go to the crows nest to retrieve my deposit check. A man approaches me and says that he is the owner, so I shake his hand and introduce myself, telling him that I'm the person that was supposed to show up Saturday for the party and was canceled on at the last minute. He instantly turns defensive and starts to laugh and say that he knows nothing about it. So I told him about our agreement and what was supposed to happen, and that I would like to get my deposit check back. He tells me he knows nothing about my check. After a few more words he expresses his disagreement about how I post dated my check. I thought he knew nothing of my check? At this point I'm furious and insist he gets my check. This is when he asks me if I know where I am and that I can't come into his establishment and disrespect him, which I replied \"Yes, I know exactly where I am\", and restated that I would like to get my check and leave. He tells me to \"get the fuck out of here\". I told him the only way I was leaving with out my check was if the cops dragged me out. He walked away still throwing obscenities at me then came back with my check lol.  Total scum bag.",

How servers to take care of the customers on a timely basis. I ordered two bottles of beer that were both warm. The bathrooms are dirty and loaded with graffiti. Waited 15 minutes to get served and another 15 to get the bill. When I questioned the bill to the manager she clearly had mistake mms for someone else and accused me of \"doing this before\".

    "text": "Yesterday my family and I had a nice dinner out on Sikly's deck.  The deck is quite large and had a bunch of tables in the shade so you're not in direct sunlight (there's table in direct sunlight if you want them).  At 5:00pm it wasn't very crowded and there were a bunch of children and babies around.  We had a tremendous view of the river.  Inside they have a great bar shuffleboard table.  We were all very happy with our dinners.  The menu has a bunch of different sandwiches, entrees, burgers, and pasta dishes.  There were definitely more upscale selections than a typical bar.  We started with apps of coconut shrimp and oysters on the half shell.  The coconut shrimp was very tasty and we loved how it was served in in coconut shell. I also had a Crab Louie salad that was very good.  My brother had salmon oscar and said it was good too.  The beer selection was rather limited, but they did have Dogfish 60 minute on draft.  I don't think there was too much in the way of wines.  Regardless, if you're looking for an outdoor river-view spot in the summer with good food, you can't go wrong with Sikly's Crows Nest.  It's also very family and child friendly.  We will definitely come again.",

    "text": "I will never set foot in Silky's Crows Nest. I was part of a river cruise with 110 young professionals for a fun night of music and dancing. Part of that night was supposed to consist of a stop for a couple of hours at Silky's Crows Nest to have food, cocktails, and more music. Due to fireworks being set from the Clemente Bridge near PNC Park, the river police closed the portion of the river that would take us to Silky's Crow's Nest. I explained to my husband, who was waiting at Silky's, that we would be about 30 min late due to the closure. He stated that he was waiting in the car because he couldn't bear the drunken mess of patrons who were part of Silky's regular clientele. My husband saw the boat approaching and went inside the bar. When he saw our boat turn around, he inquired with Silky's staff as to what was happening. They told him that we ran ground, which was False. Then, he spoke with the owner who stated, \"I don't want a bunch of drunk people in here on the last stop of a bar crawl who will buy nothing and start fights.\" My husband replied, \"Silky's is their only stop. The boat didn't set sail until 9pm. You know nothing about these people.\" He then left Silky's, frustrated from waiting for our party to arrive. My husband told me that the man was a typical drunken owner. He's seen hundreds of them, being in the bar business.  I was disappointed to be turned away from Silky's at first, due to my husband being there plus my expectation of getting some dinner and a little change of scenery. Now I think that it worked out for the better, not having to interact with unprofessional management. Silky's had no idea how much revenue they missed out on that night. If giving zero stars was an option, I would have done so. Every time I hear the name, Silky's Crows Nest\" I will repeat this story, warning whomever speaks those words of the foul management and clientele residing there.",

They would not put tables together for us outside, which was a little disappointing but it wasn't a big deal. We waited at least 30 minutes just for our drinks and another 40 minutes for our food. The place was not very busy and the waitress didn't even acknowledge that there was a delay... I ordered the Philly steak wrap and home fries. The wrap was very bland but edible...the home fries were not. They were burnt to a crisp and had a very strange taste. One of my friends ordered the sesame scallops and when they came out they were deep fried. It was disgusting. Who deep fries scallops?! She tried it and hated it. The waitress was nice enough to take it off of our check. My Husband got the seafood bisque and didn't like it very much either.  When I was younger we went to New England every summer...so I've had it before. That was not so great. Some of my friends liked their food (Buffalo chicken sandwich with waffle fries; burgers) but despite the food... for service alone I would not go back.",

I was there last week with a friend and they did not appear to be busy. We were just looking to have some mid day drinks in the sun. The hostess advised it would be at least an hour wait on food *from the time you actually order it* we said oh no problem we are just getting drinks. I then realized why she was saying it in that way because we waited fifteen minutes to be greeted by a server. Once we were though I could not complain about her service. She was very prompt on asking if we needed anything. We first ordered a margarita on the rocks which was way too sour. I'm assuming they use some type of mix. Then we both ordered a Long Island which was oddly dark brown colored. It was much more easily drank than the margarita though but you could taste how much orange juice was in it (I was unaware orange juice was to be put in a Long Island. I guess at Silkys they do). All in all the drinks sucked, our server was very nice and prompt, and the best thing they have going for them is it's hard to get mad sitting in an outdoor setting like that. I recommend going if you have lots of patience, aren't hungry, and aren't picky ;)",

    "text": "I have been to the Crow's Nest on several occasions, mostly for lunch or after work for Happy Hour since moving from Downtown to this end of town for work.  First I have to point out, in this little restaurant/bar that could probably use a little bit of a face lift has such a lovely view.  In the summer time or warmer months it is glorious to go outside and see the various boats the view of the river, the wonderful breeze blowing from the water to cool you.  Speaking of the outside the deck is great.  It is quite a selling point to come here just to enjoy that and a cocktail.  So as prior mentioned I have been here a few times, but have only eaten here for lunch.  Let me start by saying that they have a somewhat extensive menu.  Lots of different varieties of salads, soups, sandwiches, pasta, and appetizers.  Plus I am pretty sure you can order a dinner entree too if that is what you desire for lunch.    Another bonus would be their lists of specials.  I love going to a restaurant and seeing a special or two listed that give you a completely different option to chose from.  Not to mention, these specials are served with not one but two sides!  And where so many restaurants don't include items like soup or salad as a side (*you know the side options are fries, chips, and applesauce) The Crows Nest does!  This I love because they have had some really different kinds of soups on the menu that you can add as a side, and I am such a soup gal in the winter!    As for the food.  I will admit I was very unsatisfied with my soup on my last visit.  The french onion soup had a piece of bread covered in cheese floating on top of what was one of the most saltiest soups I have ever eaten, or attempted to.   Really just couldn't do it.  It was close to licking a beef flavored salt cube, just gross.  Now my wrap was quite nice on the other had.  It was a grilled chicken with bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and cheese.  Very tasty.  My friends meal was also received in high regards as it was a fried bologna sandwich.  It came on two honking pieces of Italian bread slathered in coleslaw and french fries.  It also had what I think was American cheese on it.  Now this sandwich under 9 bucks also came with two sides, and was big enough to feed two people.    I know I have been here and have had really good food and then just some average or not so good stuff.  But there is still much to try on the menu and the bar and view make this place an enjoyable stop.  Not to mention it is within minutes of my work so throw in convenience.  One thing I am definitely not a fan of, is at happy hour they play music, like really REALLY loud.  You would think the place was packed with 20 somethings dancing like they are in a club, not the more mature crowd that actually is there.  I have asked several times for them to turn it down, to which they don't particularly like doing or will do just a very small amount.  Hey I am hip and all but when I can't hear my friends sitting right next to me in a place that has less than 15 people in it that can hold 100+ I tend to get a little frustrated.  Anyhow I suggest giving The Crow's Nest a try.  Some unique things to try and that view is just fabulous.",

Even though the place was pretty empty, we did wait about an hour for our food. I ordered the cheesesteak wrap. When it arrived, I took one bite and a squirt of grease rocketed out of the bottom of the wrap and onto my leg. The experience did not get better.  On a good note, our server was very nice and seemed to be the only server working that evening, so I don't blame him--he had a lot on his plate.

The very best was when the salad was ready, this asshole was the one to serve it to me. I said very condescending, \"there...that wasn't very hard now was it?\"  On another occasion, friends went there and sat at the bar and said this same guy served them warm beer, refused to take it off the bill, and laughed at them when they complained.

    "text": "Probably not a place I would come back to. We came here on a Sunday evening with a group of about 10 after a day on the river. My girlfriend keeps her boat docked here, so we decided to continue our Sunday Funday and get some dinner & drinks on the deck at Silky's.  I didn't go inside to see the inner atmosphere, but I thought the outside deck was nice! It is right on the river and it was nice for a large group. It took awhile for waitress to come to our table, and when she did it felt like the drinks took forever. I know it is difficult when serving a large group, but this seemed extra slow. My friend also ordered a plate of french fries to start and I'm not kidding when I say it took close to 40 minutes to receive the french fries.   The food at Silky's was just sub-par. Everyone else ordered salads/more bar type food. Nobody raved about what they ordered. I was trying to be somewhat healthy so I got their fish special. It was not good at all! I only ended up eating the french fries. I would consider Silky's a \"drinks only\" kinda place!",

The other diners had large fish sandwiches and a very nice chicken salad. Inside it needs some updating, but looks better than a visit this past winter. The bar crowd seems to be a very merry bunch! We'll go back soon as we hear it is being sold for housing... and maybe the boat docks will be gone, too.",

It was pretty mediocre. The lettuce was a nice spring mix and the salad had a nice amount of cherry tomatoes and cucumbers. The chicken was pretty bland and the fries that were included on top of the salad were cold. I had hoped for better. Also this place has a \"no free refill\" policy on soft drinks which blows my mind considering the upcharge/cost passed on to the customer.",

    "text": "Pros: View of the river, accessible by boat  Cons: Dark, dingy interior, poor service and so-so food.  My first visit to the Crow's Nest was my last. My friends said to expect poor service but good food. They've dined there many times, but on this occasion were as disappointed as I.   The vegetarian in our party was surprised that the grilled vegetable dish had been taken off the menu. The server assured her that the cook could make a grilled veggie wrap. Twice she emphasized no onions, but the wrap came riddled with so many diced onions, she couldn't pick them out. The server said the cook didn't like making the wrap, so she couldn't ask him to redo it without onions. So my friend ate fries for dinner. They did take the wrap off our bill, but acted like that was a big favor.   I had a pile of wilted greens, probably from one of those big pre-cut bags, and a greasy piece of salmon. One in our party couldn't eat the clam chowder and said her burger wasn't that great. Another person only ate half of his sandwich. I know this is a burger and beer joint, so if you want to drink with a view of the river, you might be satisfied with the food. But you'll still wait forever and then the server will forget your drink, condiments, whatever. I think their attitude is the river location makes up for the food and service.",

Now pre food we ordered drinks to bide the time till our order came.  I had a Leinenkugel summer shandy and a draft bud light. My wife had a \"starburst\" and a raspberry mint mojito. Now with the ice as a filler and only a single dose of liquor her drinks were decent at best. Now comes the check! Summer shandy was steep at $5.37 a bottle glad i only had 1. Now my wifes bill was straight up ROBBERY! $16 for 2 crappy drinks?!! Ladies and gents this place is no taj Mahal and is in serious need of renovations for sure! Told our waitress about the bill being crazy high and she said i kno but...im sorry! Wtf! She definitely agreed with us. I left pissed, broke, and feeling robbed! If you say that wont be your experience than good luck and you better take out a loan or not care about money.",

HOUSE MUSIC BREEDS LOVERS, NOT FIGHTERS.  PLEASE NOTE, IN THE ENTIRE TWENTY SOME YEARS I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO DISCO (think: soul train) and PROPER AND CLASSIC HOUSE MUSIC (not drug infested raves or edm bottle service VIP brats) I HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER WITNESSED A SINGLE SOLITARY VERBAL OR PHYSICAL ALTERCATION.  NOT ONCE.   i have partied at events and venues all over the world with the kindest and gentlest of soul dj legends including frankie knuckles (RIP), nicky siano, louie vega, danny krivit, joaquim (joe) claussell, john (jellybean) benitez, joshua milan, paul johnson, tony humphries, derrick carter, eric kupper, dimitri from paris, ultra nate and the list goes on and i can assure you the people that attend these events are simply stellar pillars of the community.    why do i say all this?  because you need to understand the nature of the group on board was by no means derelict undesirables, we were a little late, anxious to arrive, refused dock access, venue entrance and service, then scolded.  and for what?  so that a silly venue could forfeit a $4k collective tab, despite and including a paid deposit, that the organizers had trouble recouping thanks to a liar.  what a fool mr proprietor/manger.  what a fool!  shame on you family lampenfields.  do you want to patronize a place like this??  think about the concern for customers when there's no regard for revenue.",

The deck was gorgeous and the view of the marina was the best of the Allegheny.  However, there were several things that made our evening go downhill.  When we arrived there was no server to greet us and stood several minutes with others until someone took care of us.  My friend and I decided to order appetizers to share around 7pm. Chicken nachos, fried zucchini slices and waffle fries. 2.5 hrs later we still did NOT have our food and others around us did (even those who came in after us). This was absolutely ridiculous!!!!  I could feel myself fuming.   I decided to speak to the manager on duty and they took one appetizer off our bill. For all the time we had to wait it should have been free!   When the food finally came it was not even that good, but we ate it anyway since we were starving...",

It's not private. Oh the food.
