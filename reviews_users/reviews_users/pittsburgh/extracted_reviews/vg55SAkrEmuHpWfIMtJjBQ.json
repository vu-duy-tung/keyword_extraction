Great service always, it is nice to find places that keep it up for many years now. I would recommend this place to anyone.

    "text": "Hey.  So.  Yea.  Legume is not a good place if you are trying to avoid meat.  Very limited and..not really meal type options if you're trying to be veg. I recall in the past they used to have a vegan tasting menu. Sadville.  Legume is a really nice place if you eat meat. I had a bite of duck and it was great. The fries are apparently fried in beef fat, but..y'know..if you mess that up you should never cook again. They were good, but..fries...eh..whatevs.  Limited menu (good thing)   They also have port. Port is all like mmmmm in my tumtum.  The raclette app was pretty lovely.  Also, the bread has too hard of a crust. Y'all need to tone that down.  I like this place but it needs to open it's mind up.",

Service was prompt but not particularly warm or friendly. There were some standout dishes like the goat cheese and pepper jelly crostini and tallow fries w/ aioli, but other items like the bok choy kimchee (which didn't go with any of their other dishes, flavor-wise) and chicken cooked under skillet were mediocre. I love dessert but nothing appealed to me on their menu (highly unusual for me), so I didn't order anything.  They have a daily menu that is posted on their website.",

    "text": "So I was fortunate enough to have an friend take me here for dinner my first week  in town.  This place is legit!    The menu changes constantly and is based on what is fresh and at its best.  For the reason, we decided to go with the tasting menu and paired wines.  Now this option wasn't cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but MY GOODNESS was it worth it.  Since they offered a vegetarian options, we ordered that as well as the omnivorous version.  It was great because we were able to taste the best of both worlds. There were at least 5 courses and wow. They were all stand outs. By the time we got to dessert, we were almost stuffed! That's great because often times tasting menus can be downright paltry.    Oh and the wines.  I'm swooning just thinking about the wines that they chose per course.  Some American, but also Italian, Spanish and French. Again, totally worth what we paid for it.    Now service was a bit spotty. Our waitress was AMAZING and the hostesses were completely sweet. But some of the food runners were more on point than others. We asked one of them about what was on our plates, since she hadn't announced it when she brought it to the table. Unfortunately, she had no clue.  So we learned not to ask her any questions and kept it moving.   A very minor slight though.  In short: if you want to take a date somewhere that you can pretty much guarantee a happy ending to the night, Legume is your choice.   Parents coming to town and want to pay for dinner? Legume all day.  I really hope to go back again sometime soon.",

I visited for lunch and had the \"Greens and Beans\" with house-made sausage. Delightfully flavorful and perfectly seasoned. My date gave me a sample of hers - Fettuccini with Pork Ragout - also spectacularly tasty. The pork was done to perfection, and the sauce complemented it with its creamy goodness. At the end of our meal, we definitely didn't want the experience to end, so we convinced ourselves to share dessert - the Chocolate chip Blondie. Ooey-gooey rich and served a la mode. Perfect!",

    "text": "My wife (who was the girlfriend at the time of my my previous review!) and I just visited the new location and it was fantastic. The food was as good as ever and the space is great, if not a bit overly ambitious.  We both tried the Surprise 3 Course Vegetarian meal, which is basically, chef's choice for three courses. All were fantastic, but the standouts were really the baked cheese starter and this corn/tomato sauce/some kind of grain middle course. I don't know what that second dish was, but boy was it tasty!   The service was excellent as before, so nothing to update here.  My only concerns are 1) will they be able to pack in the customers into this huge (about 100 seats) space and 2) what's the parking situation? On a weeknight we parked about a block away, which was fine, but not ideal. If they do valet on weekends, this shouldn't be an issue, but something to look out for.  Give Legume a try!",

Last night a very negative experience at a \"hot\" restaurant receiving lots of buzz was followed by an angry search for an alternative. Two business associates and I arrived at Legume at 8:50 pm, 10 minutes before last seating, and we were welcomed by a delightful hostess. Molly, our waitress, was friendly, professional, and clearly had expertise related to the always-changing menu.  From the Beef Tartare forward the appetizers were extraordinary.  The cold Asparagus.soup was such a light mix of complimentary tastes I ordered a second serving.  The Goat Loin entree was incredible both in taste and preparation.  I'm not typically a dessert eater but . . . Wow!    Suffice it to say, I'll jump on any opportunity to return. Did I say, \"Wow?\"  I meant it!",

    "text": "We went for lunch; the April lunch special was noodles.  Food: Perfect.  - arugula salad: not too much dressing, shaved parmesan and house-made croutons. - gemelli and lamb shoulder with sauteed greens: very tender, well-seasoned as a sauce for the pasta.  The sauteed greens made for a nice complement to the meat and pasta, and all topped with grated parmesan.  - chocolate truffle cake: perfectly crumbly without being too dry, and a slight (but delicious) crunch, topped with hand-whipped and lightly sweetened cream.   Service: We came at the end of lunch rush, and the restaurant was fairly empty. The server was competent, covered all of his bases and only forgot one small request for a lemon slice that we made. Otherwise, spotless service -- as we shared most of our dishes, they made sure we had sharing plates and new silverware as needed for each dish.   Ambiance: The decor is lovely, although the lighting was a bit dim for such a cloudy day. The seats and tables are comfortable, and the half-booth tables for two are not too narrow, as some two-seaters are at other restaurants.   Overall: We really enjoyed our experience. One salad, one pasta and dessert satisfying for two didn't break the bank at $21 including tax, coming out to just $10 + tip per person for lunch. If you have time to sit down for lunch and take a break and relax from your day, this is a great option.",

Prices are a bit on the high side but the ingredients and food quality are exceptionally high.   Arrived about 5 minutes early for our 615pm Saturday night reservation and were seated immediately. Dinner pace was very relaxed (although the table next to us was in a hurry and they were in and out in under 60 minutes)  We both started with cocktails, I had an excellently prepared Manhattan and my wife had their Old Etonion cocktail which was boozy yet well balanced.   Started with the Raclette appetizer, a strongly flavored semi hard cheese served in a cast iron skillet. Excellent.   For the main course I had the Crispy Confit Duck leg which was rich, tender and decadent. My wife had the beef loin which came out perfectly cooked and tender.   We had the Apple Bread Pudding for desert which was absolutely fantastic.",

I ordered the Vegetarian Explosion- a nice combination of greens, quiche, bread, and spelt berry salad. Everything tasted very fresh. I didn't order any alcohol, but their coffee was good and they have a large selection of teas.  The only reason I'm giving Legume four stars is some slow service. My friend and I waited at least 15 minutes for our drinks, and that was only after I waved down the server. After our food was service he disappeared as well, and it took a while to get the check.  Overall, I had a great experience and I would definitely go back.",

Truly she researched it more than me, but when I saw where the restaurant was located I was a bit of a surprise because I felt I'd past that spot before without realizing it was there. Anyway I love the atmosphere, it has a mellow, calm and soothing feel to it, but if you want to kick it up a notch, Butterjoint is it's bar area and things are more lively over there.  I had the leg of lamb, which was pretty chewy but good. The special for the night was also a lamb dish with a more tender cut for $10 more. Someone in our party ordered it and I think it was worth the extra dough. It was really good. For my side I ordered the corn and that was one part of my meal I really didn't care for. It was bland and had a stale texture to it so I could only stomach a few bites. Also as an appetizer I had the goat cheese and pepper jelly crostini. The pepper jelly was amazing and complimented the goat cheese perfectly. Lastly our server did a great job. Very helpful in explaining the menu items and making recommendations. It seems the menu is constantly changing so I hope to try this restaurant again and see what's new.  I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "Legume is possibly my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. My husband took me here for my birthday this year and not one dish we ordered disappointed us. The menu at Legume changes daily so anything I mention in this review may never be featured again, who knows. With a constantly changing menu, it really goes to show that their ingredients are fresh. The atmosphere is nice - intimate and romantic, but it's also rather simple. No hip modern decor that you'd find at other fancy restaurants in Pittsburgh. In fact, it reminded me of an old banquet hall that they spruced up a tad and turned it into a restaurant. Onto the food. OH MY GOD, I was in heaven. I ordered a corn soup with corn fritters to start. This soup is the best soup I've had. The soup was sweet, but it had a drizzle of chili oil, giving it some spice. And the corn fritters gave it texture and crunch. The entrees we ordered were also out of this world. He ordered a roasted chicken dish and I ordered a steak dish. They were quite simple in the description of ingredients, but Legume perfected them. How? I don't know and I wish I did! Perhaps it's the simplicity in it all and its about the technique in the preparation, not the glitz and glam of fancy ingredients. The chicken and steak were so moist and buttery. The desserts were, again, out of this world. He ordered a chocolate dish and I ordered a cardamom creme brulee. They were rich, but oh so simple. I really enjoy the simplistic approach Legume takes on its atmosphere, as well as its food. It goes to show that you don't need all the frills for a successful dining experience.",

    "text": "I want to give this place five stars.  I want to, but I can't.  \"as good as it gets\" is a super hard description to live up to.  Also, I have a really hard time giving out five stars.  So maybe it's five star and I just have some weird brain thing that prevents me from giving out that last star, but here were my issues with it:  It's not for everyone.  Why?  Well, for starters, the menu is pretty limited.  If you're a huge seafood fan, for example, or LOVE steak...but neither is featured prominently (or at all) on the menu...you're sort of forced to leave your comfort zone to order.    Now that is right in MY wheelhouse...I love trying stuff I've never had before, or never heard of before...but it's not in EVERYONE's wheelhouse.  My wife, for example, had a tough time finding anything that didn't...scare her.  So she ended up getting chicken.  And not that the chicken was BAD.  (it wasn't)...but it's nothing she'd order at any other restaurant.    When we left I asked her, \"Would you come back?\" and she answered \"That's a hard question to answer.\"  Which means, that it's really NOT that hard a question to answer, because other places she'd have just said, \"YES!\"  But she explained as follows:  It's difficult to compare Legume to other restaurants she loves because she didn't get something she loves from Legume in order to be able to compare it to something she loved from another restaurant.  Because the menu is limited, you're you may find yourself having to default to something you really wouldn't prefer, only because it seems like a better option than things you may have never tried.  Okay...with that out of the way, a couple minor issues:  The waiter wasn't super.  He wasn't bad.  But he wasn't super.  That alone wouldn't have dropped this review to four from five stars, but see above.  The bar was slow.  This is sort of a good problem for Legume, but sort of a crappy one for customers...the bar was PACKED, when we got there.  PACKED.  So I get why the bar was slow...but it was just something that detracted from the five-ness of the star rating.  The coffee was so-so.  We did the french press, and it was fine, but not great.  I love a good coffee with dessert.  Things I loved:  I had stinging nettle soup.  Stinging.  Nettle.  I ate weed soup for dinner.  That is COOL.  And it was good.  Sommelier.  Any nice restaurant should have someone that can steer you toward a good wine that compliments your food nicely.  Legume has one.    Seriously...stinging nettle soup.    I had the goat loin/shank/sausage with harissa and japanese knotweed.  Do you see a trend here?  They cook WEEDS and make them taste good.  That's AWESOME!!!  The goat was good.  Not great...but definitely good.  When I had bites with the knotweed and rice, the sauce, goat, and knotweed balanced out really nicely...but bites that were heavy with knotweed were bitter and because of the way it was prepared it was hard to get consistent bites throughout.  Still...really good.  Happy with my goat, I just wonder if knotweed was the best choice for the dish.  Was it awesome BECAUSE it was knotweed?  Yes.  But could it have tasted better if it had been something less imaginative, but more palatable?  Maybe.  Pretty restaurant inside.  I liked the inventiveness of the food.  I liked the ambiance.  I liked the philosophy overall.  I'd like to have given it five stars, but I feel like it suffers from limited menu, less than five star wait staff, okay coffee, and maybe (ironically) TOO imaginative dishes.",

The service was very good and accommodating to our suggestions. The value was very good for a great quality of the dining. But the star of the show was the food. One of us had their supper menu (with upgrading of the second course to their a la carte version) and the other had tapas style from the appetizers section and the asparagus soup, + we had ruburb crisp and cherry clafoudis for dessert. Everything was amazingly tasty, creative, interesting and beautifully presented. We have eastern European roots in the family and couldn't enjoy more tasting the Green Borscht with Hard-Boiled Egg and Pork and Pistachio Pate with Pickles which reminded us of  our childhood tastes. Thanks to the Chef for such a wonderful surprise. We enjoyed everything so much that already are thinking about our next getaway to Pittsburgh and wish we'd live closer then we are. If you still didn't try this place do it ASAP, and you'll thank me later.",

We made a reservation on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> for 7:45pm and got there 10 minutes early. They still had a table ready for us. It was a bigger place that we had imagined it to be, but was very noisy. It did, however, have very homey rustic styled atmosphere and decorations. The service was good. As usual, my boyfriend and I decided not to get an appetizer and get two desserts instead. We order our main dishes, but the bread didn't come until a minute before our main dishes arrived. The bread was bland and the crust was very hard. the butter spread, was just butter. We were disappointed.  For the main dish, he got a chicken paprikash. It was really good for a chicken item. It tasted more mexican than any other cuisine. He enjoyed it, so that was good. I got the  a medium-rare beef bistro with turnips, mashed potatoes, and red wine sauce. I thought that the turnips didn't go well with the entire entree and that they were better off alone. The mashed potatoes weren't evenly mashed and big chunks were everywhere on my plate. The potatoes also didn't have any seasoning. The beef was pretty good. The sauce was really good, but there wasn't enough on the plate. I thought the dish was okay, but definitely wasn't worth the price. For dessert, we got the the peaches and vanilla ice cream, and a carmele dish. The peaches were very tangy and sour. They did not taste good. The ice cream saved the dish, but i thought it was the worst dessert we have ever had. The carmele dish was very good. It had a creme filling on top, which i thought would have been better if it were ice cream instead. It was pretty good. All in all, the chicken main entree dish was good, but not at the level of such a nice place. The peaches dessert was horrible, the caramele dish was pretty good. The service was good, but the restaurant was noisy. We thought that the food was definitely not worth the price. I doubt we will go here ever again.",

This place knocked my socks off.  I've been twice and both times I have had EXCELLENT service, which really makes the difference, and the food has been spectacular.  I stuck to the charcuterie for apps, which was always tasty.  The entrees shined.  My wife's pork was the tenderest thing ever made.  My scallops were cooked to perfection.  And the desserts were also fantastic.  I can't say enough good things about this place.",

    "text": "\"You haven't tried Legume?\"  That's all I've been hearing for the past year, and my answer was always the same, \"No I haven't.\"  I finally decided to make reservations to see what all the hoopla was about.  My girlfriend and I arrived at 7pm on a Friday evening.  The restaurant was filled to capacity (40 or so seats) and as we made our way to the table we noticed that the patrons were busy eating, talking, and drinking wine.  We sat down and had the opportunity to see a few of the main dishes that were being served around us; they looked delicious. We were becoming more and more eager to sample the food.   The interior of Legume is very unassuming; the walls are painted with warm colors, and there are minimal decorations on the walls.  After a few minutes of waiting, we were seated by the hostess, Sarah Hooper, who also happens to be co-owner and wife of the Chef, Trevett Hooper.    Our waiter arrived and explained the specials for the evening in a very educated manner; he must have been a foodie.  After a few moments of indecision, we finally made up our minds.  We would start with a house salad ($8.00) of mixed greens, gorgonzola cheese, candied walnuts, and house vinaigrette.  As an appetizer, we decided to indulge; Duck Confit with Pear-Ginger Chutney ($12.00).  For those of you not familiar with what this is, let me offer a short explanation.  Duck Confit is made with the leg of the duck.  It is seasoned, rubbed with garlic, and slowly cooked in its own fat for up to 10 hours.  For my entree I chose the  1/2 roasted chicken with roasted garlic and buttered-mashed potatoes ($18.00).  My girlfriend opted for the special; Braised Veal with mashed potatoes and carrots ($26.00).  For dessert we opted for the Hubbard Squash Flan with fresh cream and a homemade ginger-snap cookie.   The salad was a perfect start.  The lettuce was crisp and cold; covered with just enough dressing so that we could decipher between the sweetness and bitterness of the different types of greens.   The gorgonzola had just enough bite to it; the veins were sour (as they should be) but the whites of the cheese softened any harsh taste that may have (but wasn't) present.  The candied walnuts were meaty and soft, adding another component of texture.  Lastly, the pears finished the salad with a sweet, soft taste.  Our duck confit arrived and we both smiled in anticipation.  The duck was cooked perfectly; its flesh was soft, and flavorful.  By the time our waiter arrived to ask if we were pleased with the dish, all that was left was a bone picked perfectly clean.  All of this eating excitement and our main dishes were still on the way.  Our entrees arrived, and our waiter said \"enjoy\" with a small snicker- he knew we were about to be thrust into culinary extravagance.  My girlfriend took a bite of her braised veal first.  She smiled, and chuckled a bit.  Her eyes grew large and she said, \"You're not going to believe this, try some.\"  I took a small nibble and began to laugh, because crying in public wouldn't have been appropriate- it was that good.  Obviously the meat had been braised for quite some time; hours even.  It was flawless- cooked with veggies and just enough liquid to permeate the entire piece of veal.   My chicken was just as good.  It too was baked to exactness, and tasted as if it too had been braised.  The meat was savory and moist; it literally melted in my mouth.  The garlic mashed potatoes were rich and buttery, a perfect complement to the poultry.   The roasted garlic bulbs that were placed around the dish were sweet; I ate them by themselves.  The Hubbard-Squash flan was placed in front of us soon after our empty entree plates were taken away.  We dug right in and weren't surprised at how good it was too; a perfect ending to the perfect meal.  If you haven't been to Legume, you're missing out.  The food is perfectly prepared by a Chef with obvious talent. Legume 1113 South Braddock Avenue,  Swissvale, PA 15218-1250 (412) 371-1815",

    "text": "This is an outstanding restaurant in most respects.  One would not recognize this as the former More Restaurant, a place where diners packed into a small space to dine on food whose quality declined over the years along with the service.   Legume has been beautifully-renovated and is attractive, comfortable, and chic.  The tables are spaced so as to allow for comfort and conversation. Attire is very casual, which I think is unfortunate for an establishment of this stature. The servers wear blue jeans.  There were no neckties and I was one of only two people wearing a sportcoat.   I saw an individual dining there who is a family member of a renowned gourmet cook, causing me to further recognize the excellence and reputation of the restaurant.  All of the food my wife and I enjoyed was unique and delicious. There is a great selection of cocktails, wines by the glass, and draft beers.  If one wishes to enjoy a glass of Miller Lite or Yuengling, they may do so for a reasonable $4.  My pumpkin ale was $6, and was delicious.  Our squash soup ($6), tallow french fries ($5), escarole salad ($10), short ribs ($21), vegetarian beet risotto entree ($18) , warm bread and soft butter, were delicious and artistically-presented. The server was competent, polite, and courteous, but not warm or engaging. The tattooed young female server at adjacent tables was jolly and delightful with the customers, imparting a great deal of information about the restaurant.  It was obvious that she enjoys her job and her customers. I would have preferred that she had served us. The support staff did most of the \"heavy lifting\", and did it well: plate-clearing, water refills, and numerous quality checks. A hungry person with a significant appetite might be disappointed as the portions are average.  For many, this will be a special occasion restaurant only, as one can expect to spend about $50 per person for a good meal.  Legume was enjoyable and memorable, unlike any other area restaurant and one of the region's finest!",

    "text": "Great place!    Excellent food, the owners do a lot of work finding great produce and top quality meat and fish. They prefer locally sourced ingredients, as long as they're delicious! They've experimented with smoking their own meats. They also develop relationships with local farms - we recently attended the second annual Jamison Lamb theme dinner, which included a presentation from the farmer about raising delicious lamb.  The menu changes daily, and usually includes a fish entree, a beef or pork entree, and at least one vegetarian entree. They have no problem with alterations and substitutions, and if they run out of something they'll probably improvise something even better.  The chef/owner (and his staff) are very skilled at making things that taste subtly amazing. The dressing on the field greens salad kind of tastes like lemon and kind of like vinegar but I just can't figure out how it tastes that good! The first summer they opened I ordered a fish dish served cold on lettuce with hard-boiled egg and pickled beets, just like a perfect retro picnic lunch. One night even I asked them why their butter tasted so much better than my butter at home!  The menu can get adventurous, in a retro euro rustic kind of way. One winter they offered roast marrow bones - so of course we had to order them. You scooped the oily delicious marrow out of the leg bones and spread it on toast, it was fatty and delicious and totally worth the calories (and labor).     Desserts are great too - frequently there's a silky panna cotta with fresh seasonal fruit, a dense bittersweet chocolate torte, and a perfect fruit crumble.  They do take reservations now, have for the past several months. You can request a reservation online from their website. I'm a little bummed about it because now they're busy all the time and we can't just walk down the street and get on the list!    The place is small and can get a bit noisy - if you're worried about that go early or late (5ish or 9ish) when it isn't full.   Also it's BYOB - which in my book means you can bring a wine you like and it won't cost you $30 extra.  $3/bottle corking fee.  Prices are on the high side, but deservedly so. Entrees can range from about $16 to $40, depending on ingredients, and appetizers run maybe another $7-11. But I'd pay the same at any good restaurant like Eleven or Dish or Soba.    Oh, for a few months (in spring 2009) they're trying Sunday brunch - some great things have showed up on that menu so far, not sure if they will make this a full-time offering.",

    "text": "I have worked in several restaurants, and for a few short weeks last summer I worked at Legume. Not only is the food outstanding (and i have stood in their kitchen) Sarah and Trevor are some of the sweetest, friendliest restaurant owners out there. They make a concerted effort to build relationships with local farmers an  source local products, whether its veggies, pork chops, or coffee. They  really \"get it\" when it comes to understanding what people want; seamlessly unifying  the local clientele's desire for unfussy, delicious homey food with the organic/slow food axis.   The duck confit is to die for. Trevor goes through the laborious process of 'confit-ing' the duck legs (cooking them in fat for several hours on low heat)  himself several times a week. The pork chops are also amazing, they are sourced from a local pig farmer and marinated in brine and herbs  for over 24 hours. The spatchcock chicken (they call it 'roasted under an iron skillet' but spatchcock is much more fun!) is also a signature. super crispy on the outside served with gravy and mashed potatoes.... New Orleans-style brewed ice coffee with chicory!   If you expect fussy, fancy food go elsewhere, this is simply well executed, delicious french influenced  home style fare. A much needed Pittsburgh gem. I wish them all the best.",

Get your last visit in before Legume reopens in a larger not BYOB space in Oakland.  Atmosphere - 1 room packed judiciously with tables with medium-low lighting and a feeling that you've found a place where people really like to eat. Young and old, dressed up and dressed down everyone was looking down at their plates.  Service - perfect. The host happily worked with me to finetune our reservation. These people are serious about making sure everyone is happy.  Food - A few bites of pepper jelly and goat cheese on crisp toasts still sit with me making me want to figure out how to make my own pepper jelly. The duck confit was my favorite dish of the night though I was glad I shared the fatty goodness so I had room for my entree. I could have used a kick of the heat of the pepper jelly or citrus acid to balance the richness. The same with my entree of a light fish over lovely rice. While perfectly cooked (chef recommended medium on this fish) I was looking for a shot of extra flavor. I did have a cold though I did detect one extra dusting of salt or seasoned salt over the fish and also the lamb steak that I also tasted. Maybe using a really fine flake salt or a really salty salt? A couple bites of the chicken specialty were a perfect example of roasted chicken. The chocolate cake with whipped cream could not have been better. I would have been very happy with the appetizer, the duck and the dessert.  The tiny kitchen requires a very short menu with a choice of about 4 items per category - appetizer and entree. The menu is posted online every day after 5. I would love to go back and try the vegetarian tasting menu on a Wednesday. The special events also look lovely.",

It is particularly disappointing with a menu that changes, that they frequently run out of featured items.  This has happened on 2 of my last 3 visits there.  I like Legume for its food and ambience but it needs to improve its service and management.",

Recently for dinner I had their pork ravioli, which was hearty and well-proportioned, but flavor-wise just okay. My husband had their sausage bonanza, ordered in part for the name, and found it well-cooked, filling, but not amazing and for the price we were expecting more.   I'd go back for lunch, especially when in the mood for a proper sit-down affair, but I don't think I'd go back for dinner. I've been for drinks next door at the Butterjoint, which is always fun and as I wrote above the service and atmosphere are attentive and unique without trying too hard.",

    "text": "If you want to have a memorable meal and an absolutely perfect--yet still relaxed-- dining experience, Legume is the place to go.   I have eaten here on several occasions: two full-blown \"celebration\" dinners, one buffet meal at one of their Solstice events, and two or three times at the adjoining bar Butterjoint for burgers, cocktails, and/or dessert. Each time the food has been delicious, beautiful, and seasonal. I had the best steak of my life here, as well as some of the most mouthwatering desserts (here's looking at you, panna cotta with honeycomb!). On my first visit, we requested chef's choice, and were blown away. Particularly memorable was an appetizer of whole smoked fish with chutney, which was out of my comfort zone, but entirely delicious.   If you want the full experience you can go the appetizer-salad-entree-dessert-wine route, for sure, but you would not feel uncomfortable at all ordering just an entree, or some appetizers and desserts to share. I really feel Legume is a good value considering the quality, portion, and overall presentation of the food. The service is equally awesome; professional and knowledgeable, but always friendly and approachable.   I would highly recommend visiting Legume any time you want a delicious, exciting meal without stuffiness or pretension.",

    "text": "SETTING I walk by Legume every single day on my way to and from school. Located in a busy part of Oakland, the exterior of this restaurant looks small and unassuming, but once inside, I realized how big Legume actually is! Clean and warm ambiance. There is also a conference room setup for dinner meetings.   FOOD Wow! Let me say it again for emphasis--Wow. I'm kicking myself for not checking Legume out sooner. Since I live so close, I figured I could stop by anytime. True, but I just denied myself extremely delicious and well-made food for god knows how long. Well, better late than never!   Entree: Pork Shoulder with Spatzle, Beer Braised Sauerkraut, Apples, Horseradish, Dill.  They might as well have not given me a fork! The pork shoulder was THAT tender. I don't think I've ever had such soft pork before. With a gentle poke, I was able to break the meat. I felt so powerful! I mean, I've been working out, but...I'm going to give Legume the credit here! Accompanied with Spatzle (noodles), the dish had some carbs to go with the protein. The Sauerkraut and dill added extra flavor. While the warm apple slices seemed random at first, the sweetness rounded out the rest of the entree very well.   Side: Thinking that this entree was mostly protein, I got a side of Tallow Fries with Aioli to balance out my protein-heavy meal. Potatoes are vegetables, right? :). Pretty good, but to be honest it was quite salty. Probably will skip this side next time.  Dessert: Poached Pear-Frangipane Tart with Vanilla Ice Cream and Whipped Cream. Never had frangipane before, but the name sounded fancy (if Frangipane was a person, she would be Topanga's best friend. \"Boy Meets World\" was such a great show!). Frangipane did not disappoint...Mmmm so good! The description was pretty spot on: a pear tart with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. Can I have another?   SERVICE Very professional and attentive. The servers (even the ones who served the drinks but did not take our order) all knew a bit about the menu offerings. They helped give us suggestions and our party was more than satisfied. Although it did not feel slow, the dinner itself did take a while. Credit to the good pacing of bringing out the food; it felt like we did not have long waits at any point. I would suggest budgeting 1.5-2 hours for dinner, in case you need to go anywhere after.  IMPRESSIONS No doubt, I'm coming back again! Such a great dining experience and the food was beautifully done. No, this is not a fancy place that serves mini portions fit for a mouse. This is a fancy place that serves regular (my stomach thanks you!) sized portions fit for a person who wants a special dinner done right. On the expensive side, but well worth it for the quality AND quantity. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",

The menu was fairly limited.  We ordered the crostini with goat cheese and pesto.  It was just ok- had too much pesto and goat cheese in the small pieces of bread.  Very small portion but it was  an appetizer.  I ordered the chicken breast which was served on baba ganush- it did not go well together.  Would have been better with mashed potato or polenta.  The garnish/ vegetable was some snap peas and cherry tomatoes.  I just don't love when my vegetable is a tomato- no matter how fresh and organic they may be.  So it was just ok. My daughter had the ravioli with ricotta- also garnished with the aforementioned tomatoes.  It was a very small portion - about four ravioli for about $28 or $26.  Not worth it.  We had some dessert hoping it would all recover but they were very standard.  $100 dinner for two but not the memorable dinner I was hoping for.",

We had tried to stop once before for lunch but be advised they do close between lunch and dinner, so this was our second attempt at lunch here. I love the vibe in this restaurant! The tables are gorgeous and comfortable. Service was exceptionally friendly. Our server seemed to know the regulars at several of the tables and greeted them with hugs, which I loved watching!  We ordered nettle soup, the housemade kielbasa and pierogies, and the BLT. I had never tried nettle soup before and it was delicious. Very light and summery and I adored the antique little cast iron crock it was served in. Points for original presentation. Chris's BLT was humongous. That thing was loaded down with ingredients and the bread was amazing brioche bread. The only downfall was that the sandwich was loaded with so many flavors that you almost lost the bacon. It was definitely there and a perfect texture addition but the flavor got a little lost in the mix. Not a problem though because all the other flavors were so amazing! The kielbasa was fantastic and the pierogies definitely weren't mrs. T's thank god! (Seriously though restaurants that serve frozen pierogies in this area, it's a sin. Stop it. Log cabin I'm looking at you). We switched meals halfway through so we could both try each others lunches. They only lost 1/2 a star because it took a really long time to get our food. We were there for almost an hour and a half. But our glasses were never empty and our server kept checking on us and updating us. Not to mention that he dealt with a different table complaining about their blt not having any bacon (after they are the entire sandwich! Really you didn't notice? Sounds like someone wanted a free meal to me) very professionally and courteously. He was a pro! Can't wait to try out dinner!",

Legume is next to Butterjoint and although they are technically different places, you can think of Butterjoint as Legume's bar - you can even order off of either menu at both places.  Legume's menu changes over time, so your options may be significantly different, but everything we had was delicious.  We started with the Smoked Bluefish Pate, which  was served with crostinis.  I have not had a Bluefish Pate before (or any kind of fish pate, actually) but this was yummy.  Plenty of smokey flavor and it went well with the bread basket (which came with rye, focaccia and baguette breads) too.  My main dish was a chicken, and I really wish I knew how they cooked this one.  The menu description said \"cooked under a skillet\", but I've only seen skin so crispy and meat so juicy in fried chicken.  In any case, it was great!  It was served over perfectly cooked rice, escarole, and garlic.  My girlfriend had a Mushroom-Barley Risotto, which was also cooked just right and had a great combination of flavors.  Service was outstanding.  Our waitress took great care of us with our orders and filling up waters.  Overall, great food and decent portion sizes.  A little on the pricey side, but not bad at all for a fancy night out.",

The kielbasa and pierogis were okay but not hot either. The porkchops were  way too fatty and the meat was over cooked.

As a token of appreciation I took a friend there for dinner, I had recently moved to the area and my friend helped with my move.   It was a rainy weekday evening in the summertime. We were seated at a small table in the front of the dining room, next to the entryway. At that time the customers would wait outside until they were seated but due to the rain the customers piled in a very small area adjacent to my chair. I could not lift my left arm without bumping into the person standing beside me.   The noise level was overwhelming to the point that I could not carry on a conversation with my friend.   The service was mediocre, we had to ask for an iced tea refill. When I complained about the crowding around my table, his response was \"I'll see what I can do\". He didn't even offer an apology.   Then there was the meal. We both ordered the same items - a salad, iced tea and the least expensive choice on the menu. Our bill was $65.00 and we both felt unsatisfied, the portions were child size. The pasta dish with caramelized onions was tasteless. The salad was the highlight of our experience.  I would normally return to give a second chance, however. since the entire experience was unsatisfactory, I will not return.",

Legume tries keep to the \"Farm-to-Table\" style as much as possible. All the staff are all friendly and polite. Cool atmosphere. Definitely will be my lunch spot.  When I first went to Legume, I loved every aspect of the experience. All of the staff were very polite yet laid-back and friendly. They were quick with service but were able to balance good conversations with my table.   I got to share the Spelt Berry Salad and it was very flavorful. I'm not usually a fan of blue cheese, but I actually enjoyed it a lot in this salad. For my entree, I had the Gemelli with Braised Lamb. The Gemelli was the perfect texture and cooked perfectly. When I bit into the lamb, it was tender and succulent. To top it off, the entree was only worth $8!   I couldn't resist dessert so I ordered the coffee crunch ice cream to share amongst my friends. All of us were first saying we would \"only have a few bites\" and once the ice cream got to the table, we were all fighting to get more.   I highly recommend this restaurant!! I'm not 21 yet, but I'm excited to check out Butterjoint when I can!",

    "text": "This restaurant is about as good as it gets, at least in the city of Pittsburgh.   Firstly, the ambiance is low-key, fairly classy, and romantic. My then-girlfriend and I were seated in a room with a table of people that were a bit too loud at times, but I don't blame Legume for that. Our service was attentive, fairly friendly, and knowledgeable.   I love that this restaurant is farm-to-table, and that is really evident in the wholesome, fresh ingredients. I love the fact that their menu changes each day.   It has been a while, but I recall that we ordered goat cheese and apricot jelly crostinis and some kind of salad to start. Both were complex and very, very delicious. While I don't usually like hard boiled eggs or anchovies, I had to eat them, because every flavor had a place in the salad, and they all came together and complimented each other perfectly.   This was also True for our entrees.. I believe we both had some kind of chicken dish, and I ordered a side of their french fries with a truffle aioli (again, absolutely incredible). Just when I thought it couldn't get much better, we ordered desserts. I recall having ordered some kind of raspberry and cream dish, and it was light and wonderfully tasty. The presentation of every single dish was impeccable.    When all was said and done, $130 or so including tip was more than worth our experience.   If you're looking for a high quality dining experience in Pittsburgh, look no further. This is simply one of Pittsburgh's best.",

I had merely a taste as I has order soup.  But my dining companion thoroughly enjoyed the appetizer.  Moving onto the soup...Nettle Soup with Creme Fraiche and Croutons.  Wow!  Something I have never had and was amazed that such an ill sounding plant can be transformed into a smooth, delicate soup.  For entrees, we had Montauk Scallops w/ Farro Crouton, Bird Egg Beans, Chickweed and Ramp Pesto (woooo strong stuff smoochers beware!) and Lamb Shoulder Chop Braised in Wine with Polenta and Sauteed Wild Greens (the lamb was grass fed and had a newer, different flavor).  Both were superb!  Loved the tender seafood and lamb (although I just had a small sample as I am not a big meat eater).  I did love the polenta that I had more than my fair share.   Although quite pleased and fully satisfied, we ordered coffee (French press!) and the ricotta stuff crepe with honey, mint and grapefruit.  The mix of flavors was great. Oh try the ginger beer for something different I will definitely be  repeat offender when it comes to legume bistro....I do hope the new location has as much charm and continues serving great, sustainable (yes!!) food.   Oh BYOB and call as soon as you know a night you want to go as their reservations fill up fast!",

While the inside lacks much decor the food and service make up for that in leaps and bounds. I made a reservation since the place is small. Despite getting caught in traffic for 30 mins (and thus being that late) the staff held the table I'd reserved for my boyfriend and me.   Their menu changes quite often (monthly I think?) and I could not have been happier with our selections. One of the highlights was the corn soup - incredible, robust and flavorful- I've never had anything like it! My peach glazed pork chop was incredible as well as were the perfectly tender green beans and fluffy rice that came with it.   Despite being stuffed after dinner we ordered dessert and thank God for that! We had the chocolate truffle cake and it was unreal, melt-in-your-mouth chocolaty goodness. And it was smothered in homemade whipped cream. We topped if off with delicious coffee served in individual strainers.   Stunning meal. Wish I could transport this place to NYC!",

    "text": "*For the bar  Legume is a spot that I haven't been to since it was a tiny affair in Regent Square. Wild success bought them a much larger space in North Oakland, amid cheap college housing and Pittsburgh culinary staples like Lulu's Noodles, this might have seemed like a strange move to make. So strange to me, in fact, that I let Legume slip silently from my mind and never considered it again, until recently.  Searching and re-searching Yelp for some restaurant or unique feature that I may have missed on the last pass, as I often do, I happened to stumble across the fact that this new-and-improved Legume had a bar! Aptly named, the Full Service Bar is open from 4p-midnight, and offers not only a solid beer and wine selection, but a fair selection of small bar-bites from the kitchen, which is also open until midnight. Honestly, though, I can go anywhere in town to grab a beer and a bite - what drew me in was that they not only have a 4p-6p happy hour, but a 10p-midnight happy hour as well! That's right, stop in for skillfully crafted bar food and discount drinks, specifically $2 off drafts, $4 wines, and $5 well drinks - along with some weekly specials(ie, $5 punch on Monday) and live music/DJs(I think Zombo plays Tuesdays)  We arrived at about half-past 10 and Legume itself had already closed, but the bar has a separate entrance in the entryway. The bar is beautiful, lined with comfortable leather-backed barstools, a high-table with a wooden alcove, and dimly lit by candles and sconces on the wall. In the back are a few low 4-seat tables with leather chairs to have a group of people sit. The bartender greeted us quickly and handed us a cocktail and draft list, along with a bar menu. The menu has about 6-8 small plates, a few soup/salads, and 3-4 dessert options. The draft list was decent, however 2 slots of their 10 choices were wasted on Miller Lite and America's oldest brewery(Yuengling). The bartender was happy, though, to give us samples of Duck-Rabbit Doppelbock and Southern Tier's 2x Stout(She was also nice to our fellow patrons, giving them a whirlwind tour of the finer points of gin and a quick intro to Mezcal).   My girlfriend stuck to her 2X($4), while I wound up with a standard Manhattan, which turned out to not be part of the $5 well drinks(it was $8), but the bartender let me slide since she wasn't aware until after it was made. We also settled on an order or Risotto Balls($4) - coming 8 to a set(think Lindt truffle-sized) with a small ramekin of something that seemed an awful lot like citrusy mayo, but it was dark enough in the bar that I could pretend to uphold my diet by not asking. The risotto balls were very crispy on the outside and the inside was creamy and delicious - definitely a nice alternative to french fries.   Having finished our risotto balls but not our drinks, we also ordered the crostini with chevre and pepper jelly($4) - a kitchen open as late as the bar is such an overlooked luxury! They arrived quickly, 4 slices of toasted bread completely overloaded with goat cheese, and a dollop of sweet and spicy heaven on top of each. The cool and creamy goat cheese really paired well with the flavor of the jelly, and the jelly itself was so good I grabbed every last bit I could from the plate.  I still have yet to try the restaurant portion of Legume, but the bar has certainly won me as a late-night regular, especially on a low-key but classy evening. Also, they have their own twitter @FullServiceBar, so be sure to keep up!",

Despite loving Legume for many years, the past year or so, I have sometimes felt disappointed with them.   The chocolate truffle cake is still divine. Most of the appetizers are also incredible. But they have simply not been hitting it out of the ballpark in terms of the entrees. I've been several times now where I've 1) not been particularly excited about the options available, and 2) thought the entrees were simply OK, but not stellar. The fish entrees, for example, are fine, but not wow. So goes for the vegetarian options too. And, because Legume sources their meat locally, I feel licensed to eat meat there when I go. The last time I was there, they were serving Jamison lamb, which I know is very high quality. The server warned me that they did not trim the meat, so that I would have to deal with gristle and such, but woah. That leg was nigh inedible. I don't usually have a problem with having to work for my food, but the amount of work I had to put in, for the payoff, was not proportionate.  Don't get me wrong - I'll keep on coming back to Legume, but it will probably not be the first option that comes to mind from now on.",

I was surprised how large the space was in this place; given that the menu is constantly changing, I expected a small dining room, but it's surprisingly spacious.  I would guess that they have to run out of things, but we didn't have any problems with that while we were here.    The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars...there aren't a lot of entrees on the menu; when I was there, there were only 3 proteins, one was salmon & two were steak.  If you're not a meat eater, you're limited to the one bowl suppers...the options are okay but appear to be carb-heavy.   Looking at today's menu, there are 4 protein options, so maybe I just caught it on an off night.  Prices are reasonable given the execution; I'll add this place to my \"special\" rotation.  One last thing...we tried buttermilk panna cotta...if you see it on the menu, you have to get it.  It's freakin' fantastic.  I'm not normally a dessert person, but I could have this every night.",

The Pate was flavorful with seasoned bread and mustard.  But I was really blown away by the pickled green beans on the side! The grade of Lamb Shank was very good.  It was slow cooked and braised, loaded with fall-off-the-bone flavor.  The carrots were unbelievable!!!  Sweet and tender.  Fingerling potatoes were a nice balance. I'm not sure what I had for dessert, as my wife ordered it, but it was sweet and a good mix of flavors.  Chocolate, pears and meringue.  What a way to end a meal! I am completely honest when I say this is one of the best, if not THE BEST, meal I've ever tasted.  Portion size was perfect.  Food is out-of-this-world!!! Decor is tasteful...very nice.

    "text": "Legume: Taking the Industry Out of Food  So, here's a lil' secret for you.  I avoided dining at Legume for quite some time.  Why?  It's simple really.  You see I am a carnivore at heart and the namesake of this eatery led me astray.  Silly little me assumed that a place named Legume (defined as the fruit or seed of plants...think beans for example) was a sole provider of vegetarian delights.  After stumbling upon their website, I realized I was wr...wr...wrong.  It turns out that Legume does plate up some tasty greens, but it's also one of the best places in the 'Burgh to savor just about anything.    Legume is an upscale restaurant in the Oakland area that sources as many of its ingredients from local farms and artisans as possible.  Once those items are procured, the magic begins in their spacious kitchen.  Executive chef, Trevett Hooper, and his team take pride in preparing each dish by hand.  These folks are no strangers to butchering whole animals fresh from the farm or rolling out fresh pasta.  It's commonplace to witness the grinding of grains to make polenta or to see all hands on deck when pitting bushels of sour cherries.  You can literally taste the time and the love that goes into every thoughtfully prepared dish.  On our latest visit to Legume, my in-laws (visiting from NY) were willing participants in trying one of my favorite dining spots.  As they perused the menu, they asked if we'd ever tried this (Blue Fish with Carolina Gold Rice and Chive Butter), that (Short Rib Ravioli), or the other thing (Lamb and Mashed Pototes).  The answer each time was, \"Nope.\"  That's one the qualities I admire most about Legume.  The menu constantly changes because Chef Trevett only uses what's fresh and in-season.  So if you're the kind of person who orders the same dish each time you eat at a particular restaurant, you might be saddened by Legume...but only for a moment. Your frown will be turned upside-down because the daily menu (released each day by 5pm) is so masterfully constructed that you won't be disappointed in trying the latest masterpieces.  (Okay, okay, one time I was looking pitiful because the Cherry Pie for Two they had earlier that week was all gone.)

    "text": "Went here last night for my birthday dinner. I knew before the reservation was made that my fiance and I would be doing there tasting menu. As soon as we arrived we were seated and ordered our drinks. I really like that all there beers are draft. The house bread was good crunchy but chewy in the middle. Our first course was a sample of pickled vegetables. It was bright and I could taste each component on its own but not something I would order again.  Second course was a grilled radicchio salad with anchovies. Now I have tried to avoid these little fish by all means. When I hear anchovy I picture little buggy eyes staring up at me from a tin can. However that was not the case. The salad was good. A little heavy on the dressing and carried the vinegar flavor over from the first course. It was good but also something I wouldn't order on my own again. At this point our beer was gone and it was time to move on to something a little stronger. We both ordered cocktails. I chose mercy of the bartender and got something that was a little bubbly but reminded me of Yeager.  I'm guessing its from the bitters which is not quite my thing. My fiance got a rev dr Daniel hall which I liked. Third course was house made sausage with lentil and pig belly. This was by far my favorite dish. It was spicy, creamy and crunchy. It was definitely the star of our meal. The fourth course was seared yellowfin tuna with fingering potatoes olives and a miso-gribiche sauce. This was also just good. I wish the sear was a little darker. All the components were served slightly warm which was ok I was just hoping for something hot and hearty on a cold night. Desert was good I had a brulee that was very good and the fiance got a poached pear with biscotti. The wine that was paired with my dessert (somas nectar) was so good we bought a bottle to take home. All and all it was a very nice meal. I was hopping for something a little more robust on a cold night. If there was a theme to the dinner it would have been pickling. Which they do well. The service was top notch and a different server brought out each dish and was able to explain it.  It was a nice meal but I think next time we go well be ordering from the menu.",

Seriously comparable to a NY/CA foodie restaurant.  BYOB too- which is always nice. The cuisine is delectable, and can best be described as fresh, seasonal, local, organic fare.  I would say \"California Cuisine\" but won't for obvious reasons.  Everything we have eaten here, from the appetizers to the desserts are amazing.  A few downsides that aren't a hang up for me- but may be for other people.  The restaurant, located in Regent Square is TINY, (that being said, it is MOVING to a bigger location in Oakland this Summer-yeah!) I have always made reservations beforehand.  Also, because of the small space, the restaurant only has a certain number of certain entrees, etc.  My fiance ALWAYS chooses what they have run out of- so that's kind-of annoying, but I get it.  Totally amazing- really yummy, charming atmosphere, polite staff. Loves it.",

But if you're looking for a relaxed meal where you can be assured that the emphasis has been placed on the food, they're definitely worth a visit. The melding of traditional Italian, French and American fare with a rotational menu brings just enough flare to keep the offerings exciting. Quality food with quality service always deserves a recommendation. \"",

    "text": "At this point, we've all been hammered over the head about seasonal ingredients, nose-to-tail eating, and the merits of being a locavore.  Watching celebrity chefs on TV remind us about the importance of using fresh, local ingredients is beginning to border on insulting--we get it.  And no, we can't afford to get our fish overnighted from the Pacific.  But a place like Legume--my favorite restaurant in 2010--reminds us all how important those things really are.  Legume manages the almost impossible balancing act of being ethically sound without being preachy.  If I were a much, much better cook, this is the kind of place I'd want to run.  They source locally and pick sustainable ingredients for their dishes.  They can their own tomatoes during the summer since winter tomatoes are...well, terrible tasting.  There are a ton of little details like these in terms of how the back of the house is run that make me love this place.  If you're familiar with how Arrows (ME) approaches food, this isn't too far off.  But let's say you love red snapper and Chilean sea bass and have no real interest in where your food is coming from, all you care about is how it tastes.  It tastes amazingly good.  I've eaten at Legume a number of times and I had to rack my brain to remember a single, slight slip from the kitchen (slightly, slightly overdry meat, and only once out of many visits).  Although the chef generally keeps \"safe\" options on the menu (Chicken Under a Brick, etc), I strongly recommend giving the more unusual offerings a try.  Even the sides and addons are amazing--Belle has developed an unhealthy addiction to their pickled haricot verts.  It's a fairly small place, but has a fun, hip atmosphere well-suited to Regent Square.  And, a final plug for their theme nights.  They offer a regular vegetarian menu as well as seasonally-focused special events.  It may be something like offering lobster ravioli in fall (yes, lobster is seasonal) or my personal favorite, offal night.  Lots of places in Pittsburgh do excellent food.  Legume does that, but also does really interesting, obviously very personal food.",

    "text": "I'm still relatively new to Pittsburgh. I went to Legume with a couple of friends to kick off our \"Supper Club\" where we try out different local restaurants. I chose Legume because it sounded unique in it's local sourcing of produce, European inspired yet American food and daily changing menu. Their website only posts the most recent menu as it changes every day! The food was hands down FANTASTIC! Whether the pepper jelly crostini and goat cheese appetizer (a must if you're there in my opinion), or the fresh bread that they serve as we waited on our entre or the Spicy Kimchi Soup; they were all outstanding. I ordered the sweet potato ravioli with oyster mushrooms, the only vegetarian entre which was just the perfect balance of the \"comfort\" that sweet potatoes stand for and unique flavors that came from the sage, kale and other herbs We were lost for choice when it came to their dessert menu. We settled on sharing the cardamom pudding, which again was brilliant. The uniqueness of a flavor like cardamom in the comforting familiarity of pudding and mousse comes together and just blew me away with every spoonful. I think the quality of ingredients they use, fresh seasonal vegetables, dairy and produce makes their food so soulful. I was a bit disappointed with my drinks though (which come from their bar next door, Butterjoint). I ordered the \"Mercy of the bartender\" which is exactly what it sounds like and I mentioned that rum is my preferred poison. Now with a blank slate to work with, I was excited to see what I'd be surprised with. I received my first drink which I think was a version of the 'El presidente' - Citrusy and White Rum. which I thought tasted fine..nice and stiff.. but also rather boring and unadventurous. For my next drink, I asked for something more exciting. \"Surprise me\" is what I said. Yet again, i received a white rum based citrusy cocktail which again, tasted okay.. but totally didn't match up to the high standards the appetizers and the food had set by then. I also felt that with a story like theirs, a menu that sets these expectations and food that totally knocks it out of the park, there's room for improvement in the service department. Our waitress on that particular occasion, although efficient, would not smile, wasn't particularly amused when I asked what was in my drink and would respond to our questions with quick, curt to-the-point replies. I'd certainly recommend this restaurant both for special occasions, date night or just a good dining experience. Just order one of their regular cocktails or pick from their fairly diverse wine list to complement your food and you should be fine.  One more thing - I just looked at their menu online and it's the exact same as when I dined there a couple of weeks ago.. which was the exact same menu I'd seen when I reserved the dinner which was another couple of weeks before I actually dined there. I asked my friend who dined there a 2 years ago and she ate the exact same food that I did. So, the \"daily changing menu\" on their website might be a bit of a stretch.",

Goat cheese crostinis were out of this world.  Girlfriend ordered swordfish and I had a steak dish - we enjoyed them both.  The chefs are clearly masters of their craft and it is a joy to experience culinary excellence of this level.  Service and ambiance make Legume a True 5 star restaurant.  Great spot for birthday, anniversaries or just a good old fashioned date night.  Can't wait till next time - nominee for best restaurant in PGH.",

    "text": "4.5. I visited Legume late on a Wednesday night at sat on the bistro side of the restaurant at the bar. The ambiance was dark, woody, upscale, yet casual. Everything I had at Legume was good, but ranged from spectacular to forgettable.   The warm carrot soup ($8) with onion relish, yogurt, and smoke chile oil was outstanding (5/5). A wonderful combination of flavors that all paired perfectly with each other. Then there was the grilled chicken heart ssam with cucumber and pickled radish ($6) was also another home run (5/5). The first time I had chicken hearts was in Brazil in 2006 and was amazed. Then again in Lagos at a Portuguese restaurant and was put off. Legume has restored my faith in the delicacy with a fantastic Asian twist.   I was told that the beef tartare ($12) is favorite among customers, but I found it forgettable and would not order again (4/5). However, it was very fresh and I have nothing bad to say about it. The dish just did not \"wow\" me.  Lastly, I had the smoked bluefish pate ($11) was enjoyable (4/5) but I am not sure I would order again until I ordered the rest of the menu.   Finally, I had a taste of the Seven Falls Cabernet (glass is $11) (4.5/5) and found it to be a nice jammy cali cab. Then ordered a glass of the Les Castines Cabernet Franc ($12) (4.5/5) and loved the fruit forward first sip followed by a peppery finish and balanced with strong tannins.",

    "text": "Not since my trip to Spoon last year have I been so pleasantly surprised. Legume surpassed all expectations and I cannot wait to return for more.   After browsing the menu, we realized that the tasting menu would be the best and most creative option for us.  Our waiter, Tate, suggested that we choose the vegetarian and omnivore option in order to experience  more of the menu.  Obviously we agreed.   To start we both were served the Vermont raclette plate which was amazing melted cheese and pickled vegetables.  Incredibly savory yet had a bite of the brine.  For the second course I received a grilled escarole salad and Rich enjoyed the butternut squash soup.  Both were flavorful and consumed in their entirety.   Our main courses were the most impressive - perfectly cooked scallops in a balsamic reduction or a cheese tart with tomatoes and lentils.  I truly cannot express how delicious each dish tasted.  All I know is that I haven't had scallops that tasty since I left New England 5 years ago. Wow!  To end the night,  Tate brought a pumpkin cake with vanilla ice cream and pota creme... pot de la creme?  I don't know exactly what it was called but it was heavenly!  Carmel and creamy and savory... I felt like it was doing pirouettes on my taste buds.  I couldn't have asked for a better ending to our meal.   Thank you to Tate and Legume for a magnificent evening.  I will be back soon, looking for more surprises.",

    "text": "Ate at Legume with my husband and two friends last Saturday night - really great food but pricey esp for Pittsburgh area. We booked Legume three days out and were able to obtain a 7:45pm reservation with no issues on opentable.   The menu was posted by 5pm that day as promised, and it was totally delicious - basically everything had garlic scapes which were light but kind of like green beans - the menu had some edgier items but just nice upscale American food. We appreciated that the fresh bread kept coming and it was delicious and it came with some softened butter; super fresh too, nice crust and the inside had lots of bubbles.   We shared the beef tartare appetizer which came with crostini - pretty good but not the best I've ever had. The two guys got the \"chewy steak\" (seriously it was advertised that way) and it came medium rare with garlic scapes - they said it was pretty good, had a nice char, I'd say it was more rare than medium rare but it was chewy.    One friend and I ordered the vegetarian tasting menu - $37 for three smaller courses - a carrot soup with salsa, a mushroom toast, and ricotta cheese ravioli with salsa and garlic scapes (duh). The carrot soup was really light, and kind of fall-ish with sour cream and a light salsa. The mushroom toast was literally one longer piece of their house bread with sauteed crimini mushrooms on top. I was stuffed by the final course, so didn't finish it but it was a nice easy ravioli dish with a creamy herb sauce and garlic scapes. For dessert we all shared a fresh panna cotta w/blueberries and crumbled meringue on top - perfection.   Overall the food and service was excellent, tab for four people with 1 drink each and 1 shared dessert was $208. Our waitress was really nice, and was able to provide answers to any questions we had about the drinks or menu items, and she was also gracious since I broke a table lamp. :( The drinks menu fell over on the old school glass and metal lamp and it shattered - I felt awful - but she said it happens a lot...cringe!",

Ingredients and technique are both clearly top notch, but the dishes felt like the chef threw a few darts at a list of ingredients and tried to make it work.   Mashed potatoes had turnips needlessly added, salad had large pieces of raw parsnips, steak was very poorly done: raw instead of medium as was requested, swordfish was served with a syrupy sweet sauce that soaked all of the rice. Potentially great dishes were tainted with questionable decisions.",

You heard it here first (maybe not first), their lunch is a matching 5 stars to their dinner. And Butterjoint. And pretty much anything they do! But the thing that impressed me, maybe most, is when a place is packed during lunch! AND, it's not as if they're in a really busy area of Oakland. People WANT to come here. They know what's up!   Let's face it, lunch can be the most boring meal of the day, I'd eat eggs and toast and a meatloaf for dinner and love them all. But lunch, yuck. I hate it.   I don't hate it when I have lunch here! The tomato soup? So delicious! My yellowtail tuna melt. Incredible! I think the bread underneath may have been brioche and it was incredible. I also liked that it was open faced so I could eat it with a fork. Scrumptious! And you get a side of potato salad! All for $15. That's a steal!  I could come here everyday for lunch. Then my afternoons would never be boring!",

    "text": "Wow. What a fun night! Chris took me out for a real nice birthday dinner (finally a nice dinner when we first had off). We have never been to Legume and I have been mentioning it so why not!  There is parking, even if there is a fee. I wish that we could have parked closer since I am wearing a walking boot (broken foot). But I let that go!   The menu was simple but still a lot to think about. I will have to say thank you to our waiter for providing some really good feedback and putting up with our questions.   Nice things to share: We picked the grass-fed beef tartare with traditional garnishes. Apparently my first choice of the Pickle Platter with Aioli was a problem for Chris. I found it odd that in the eight (!!) years together I never noticed that he doesn't eat pickled food. Which led to an interesting pickle conversation at dinner. BTW, I love pickled food.... I have never had tartare prepared like this. It came out on a plate like a smushed hamburger with the garnishes all around the sides of the hamburger and then an egg yolk in the middle. The bread came on the side in a basket. I was a little shocked by that display. I mean it looked good but it looked weird. Chris dug in first. I then put aside my weird feelings and made myself a little bread slice with the tartare on the top. Yum. It was great. I still think that the egg put it over the top but we ate it and it was great.   Entrees: I ordered the 10oz lamb leg steak with Carolina gold rice, Hakurei turnips and a husk cherry chutney. OMG. So good. Seriously I cannot talk about how good this dish was. First, the turnips were amazing. I was apprehensive about the turnips but these were adorable, mini, and had an amazing flavor. The lamb steak was cooked to perfection with the chutney on the top it was amazing. The flavor of the steak combined with the chutney. WOW. The rice was interesting. It was in smaller pellets, more like quinoa than rice. But still was nice. I would have like to have something green or another color on the plate but the dish was great.   Chris ordered the braised chicken paprikash with hand cut noodles, broccoli, chives, and creme fraiche. Yummy. I took a few bites. The chicken was thigh meat. Which is interesting because Chris does not like thigh meat. (This I do know.) He said it tasted really good and was happy with his dish. The bites that I tasted were really good. The fresh pasta I think was the star of the dish. It was so fresh and great tasting. The broccoli were only a few bunches and were just ok. Nothing that special. The sauce was also good, but not above and beyond. Still the dish was good.   Dessert: Lemon verbana panna cotta with concord grape sauce and a short bread cookie. I ATE ALL OF IT. Seriously, Chris did not even get one bite. I mean he also did not want any so I got to eat it all. The concord grape sauce was sweet and tangy. The panna cotta was flavorful and not too sweet. Yum.   We had a great experience and I am happy that we finally went! I loved the food. I do not know if we will make it a routine but still the food was good enough to go. I suggest everyone should at least go once to try it.",

Our niece ordered the homemade chicken fingers, which arrived five minutes after we ordered.  The server said she thought it would be best to get those out ASAP.  She's 10, not 4, and why did the server take it upon herself to make that decision without asking?  So we watched our niece eat while we waited thirty minutes for our food, then she watched us eat.  On top of that, our server was almost non existent.  We'd planned to order dessert to eat together, but it took her forever to return, so we didn't bother.  Pretty good food, terrible service.",

    "text": "If I could I would add an additional 5    This place is AMAZING! This was my first experience with Legume and I had no idea what I was in for.  When I waked in the place was busy but not to over crowded and the overall ambiance was nice. There was a diverse group of people I could see that were seated plus the decor was interesting. I liked the fact that the menu pointed out there was a shelf with jars of preserved local peppers that was used on a previous menu item along with the origin of the peppers.  Now I won't lie the food is pricy but you get what you pay for and then some!  We decided to get two entrees to try and an appetizer. For the appetizer we got goat cheese crostini with pepper jelly. So I'm thinking what can be so great about some toast with goat cheese and jelly. Well was I fooled I don't know if it was the local ingredients but it was so delicious the balance of flavors along with a subtle hint of heat was exquisite. I could of ate a dozen more. Then one of the entrees we got was Arctic char, which to be honest we had no clue what it was but decided to go on a whim. Then the  waiter asked how we like our salmon cooked so we figured it out after that.  Other entree we got was grass-fed beef rib steak. Let me tell you the portion sizes were bigger then I expected. I so thought I was paying for a bite or two of a dish but was I shocked to see a quality meal and an awesome size to boot! I can't even begin to describe the food. It was some of the best food I have tasted in my entire life, NO JOKE. During one point of the meal my dinner date looked at me and said wow this is how salmon is supposed to be cooked and it was our favorite of the whole dining experience.  All I have to say is if you have the money and time please go here. Only thing I can worm you about if everything is made to order and they only have so much of everything. We wanted to try a custard dessert but they ran out, which I was really disappointed but it's understandable. I do hope to make it back soon and what other delights I can try.",

I was a little early, so I started with a glass of wine (a red blend) from Butterjoint - the bar next door.    I then carried that over to the table at Legume and perused the menu.  I am a fan of a short menu since I get overwhelmed by too many options, and this one is definitely short.   If I had one criticism, they could stand to add a couple of entrees to the list (but that's really reaching).     I settled on a starter of the Crostini with Goat Cheese and Pepper Jelly.  Four pieces of crostini neatly assembled with the toppings.   Jut the right amount of bread to cheese to jelly - a great start.   I then moved on to the Spanish Mackerel with Crispy Potatoes, Fennel, Arugula, Meyer Lemon, Sungold-Morita Aioli and Gastrique.   I asked the server for a wine recommendation since I wasn't very familiar with the fish.   He noted what I was drinking already and then gave me both a red and white recommendation.  I took the red recommendation (a pinot noir), which was really a lovely pairing with the meal.     Service was good throughout, though bar drinks do take a few minutes longer than they really should.  I was too full for dessert, but it really looked good.  I am definitely looking forward to a return visit to Legume and also Butterjoint, which also has a small selection of delicious looking bites in addition to their bar drink menu.     Tips!  They have valet and there is a lot across the street as well which is free after 6.   They also have a complimentary coat check.",

    "text": "We got in a little late (around 9.30pm) so we decided to sit at the bar. The food is the same, some items are 50% from 9pm-midnight and I think the bar looks much nicer!  The menu has lots of french influence and everything we order was amazing As apetizers, we got: - the raclette. The cheese was legit, but the food wasn't hot enough by the time we got it (they should use stone or metal dishes) and they didn't serve potatoes with the raclette (but that's fine, they don't claim to be a french bistro). - the mushroom soup, which was perfect.  For the main meal, we got: - the halibut fish. It was very tasty. However, I think the dish should have been served with more vegetables and the rice should probably have been placed on the side instead of underneath the fish. - the risotto was very good. The carrot puree that came with it was also very good.  Finally we had the spanish coffee and truffle cake for desert, both were really yummy!  Overall it's a great place to eat. I heard the menu changes very often, so your mileage might vary depending on when you go.",

    "text": "I went here for valentines day and I have to say I was impressed beyond my expectations, which were high to begin with.  The prix fixe was incredible, we both had the Cream of Parsnip and Apple Soup with Croutons and then Maine Diver Scallops with Parsnip Puree, Lentils, Bacon with Port. Finally, I had the chocolate truffle cake while she  had the gingerbread.  The meal began with a tasting of fresh bread, warm butter, salt-cod and potato puree spread, house-made pickles, and broiled chevre.  The tasting was amazing, high point was the salt-cod and potato puree, not only because it was one of the better things I've tasted in months but also because I have a whole fillet of salt-cod on my fridge already and until then I had no plans for how to use it.  The soup was clear and subtle; presentation was simple and well done.  The scallops were cooked perfectly.  Opaque in the center with a golden edge, sitting atop a bed of parsnip puree and lentils (which had been prepared with smoked bacon) all surrounded by a touch of port reduction.  I have but one complaint: I think the menu should have stated how much better the gingerbread would be in comparison to the truffle cake.  That being said, the truffle cake was very good.  The gingerbread, however, was the sort of dessert one aspires to make.  Moist but not buttery or oily.  Spiced, but not overly so and all of the spices tasted fresh and vibrant. I hate that I chose the truffle cake, which was very good.  It's not often, unfortunately, that I afford myself the chance to go to a restaurant, where I feel it's appropriate to rate the service.  The staff at legume was clean, friendly, and unobtrusive.  The best staff is only present when necessary.  And this is True of legume.  My needs were met constantly without my needing to acknowledge them, even in the face of a dinner requiring a revolving selection of silverware and plates.  My wine was opened table-side, without knee or table support, something you may only appreciate after years of working in the service industry.  And my water was never empty.  I enjoyed my meal infinitely more because of this treatment.    I see, in a lot of the reviews, that people believe this to be a pricey restaurant - it's not.  The prices are more than fair for the meal you're getting.  I look forward to returning for the Wednesday vegetarian prix fixe someday soon.",

    "text": "I wholly embrace the farm to table philosophy and generally frequent restaurants that make a conscious effort to prepare food produced in its surrounding area. However, the problem I've been running into recently is the food at a fair number of places have simply been underwhelming.  To my delight, Legume does it right with regard to partnering with nearby farmers and food producers in order to offer patrons an ever-changing menu that is both unique and delicious.  For starters, I went with the bluefish pate with crostini, which was soooo good. After that I had the red oak salad with baby beets, blood orange, chevre and vinaigrette. The lettuce and beets were very fresh and reminded me of how much I miss the farmers from Lancaster county and I was dreaming of the Sundays spent at the Headhouse Market in Philadelphia.  For the mains, I was struggling a bit as everything looked good, but settled on the scallops with salsify puree, parsnip and brown butter, based on the recommendation of my excellent server, Justin. The scallops were perfectly cooked with that lovely crisp on the outside.  Although the desserts looked amazing, I didn't have room and opted for an after dinner drink.  Hopefully the glowing review of Legume will help motivate the staff to continue putting out such high quality meals so their patrons (and this reviewer on subsequent visits to Pgh) can savor amazing food from a wide array of produce year round.",

The meal they prepared was very appropriate in both the succession of flavors and the portion sizes.  Everything was very well prepared.  The wines were all very nice, but the pairings could have been better.  It seemed like the person who was preparing the food menu and the person who prepared the wine listing didn't actually talk to each other.  I could have lived without the series of employees who came by to socialize with the couple at the table next to ours for most of the meal.  Having to look at someone's ass for an entire course at a time really takes away from the ambiance of a place.  Overall, we were pleased by the meal, and will go back sometime.",

    "text": "Some family recently came to town, so I decided to give the dining room another shot. I thought Legume would have items that would appeal to everybody. I made a reservation a couple of days ahead, at which point I informed them that I am vegan. The veg item on the menu the night of our visit was an egg and corn based crepe filled with ricotta and some greens. Two from our party ordered that and their reaction was like, \"eh, it's ok.\" Since nothing on the menu was vegan and my advance notice was ignored (as usual), I had to ask if they could make me something special. I also ordered a salad, omitting the cheese that was intended to be in it. The salad was roasted red peppers, tomatoes and greens (it was supposed to also have pea shoots, but they forgot to put them on mine); fresh, but nothing extraordinary. My \"special\" dish was a small portion of pasta (undercooked) with the same roasted red peppers, tomatoes and greens; no sauce, no herbs - very plain, and hey, way too reminiscent of the salad I had JUST hardly enjoyed. I am extremely disappointed by the lack of innovation here. To make matters worse, I very slowly chewed on my extra chewy pasta hoping that our server would come by so that I could send my meal back, but he never came to check on us, so I kept on chewin' until it became apparent to us that we were running late to the theater and to him that it was time for our check.",

    "text": "Until about a month ago, this was one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I looked forward to eating their delicious burgers every time we went there for dinner. Then I got food poisoning, along with another member of my dinner party that night, both from their burgers. My friend got less severely sick than I did but I ended up in the hospital. I just got the bill today for $9,998.00. The most expensive burger I've ever eaten. I notified the restaurant about the incident and they were extremely dismissive and denied that it could have been their food. However, I find it coincidental that my friend and I both had burgers together for dinner... we hadn't seen each other or eaten anywhere else in common that day or week even, and I hadn't eaten anything for 9 hours prior to going to dinner at Legume. I got sick about 1.5 hours after consuming the food - which the doctor in the emergency room said was consistent with a food poisoning timeline (it happens either right away within 2 hours or about 8-9 hours later after you've digested the food). The stomach cramps were the worst pain I'd ever been in my whole life and now I am left with the hospital bill.   The same night that we were served the contaminated food, the servers were visibly frustrated with the cooks. I'm a very observant person and I noticed that one particular server kept cussing under his breath when running food out to customers... the cooks were messing up the orders and not following the tickets correctly. If I had to guess - I would say that frustration in the kitchen probably lead to some sort of negligence that lead to cross contamination or something like that. I understand that food poisoning can happen - its the chance you take when you eat out - but the restaurant was very rude and dismissive to me over the phone. I would have at least expected them to apologize and assure me that they would look into it so that the same terrible experience didn't happen to other diners.",

I liked that the best thing on the menu (of the things we tried) was also the cheapest - love that in a restaurant.  My only consideration was that the chicken looked delicious but took 40 minutes to make, even though we were in the first seating of the evening (and people who choose the first seating usually do so because they have somewhere else to go that evening.)  Other than one regrettable choice for the ever-changing menu, the whole meal was really great.  I'd definitely recommend others to come here, and if I were planning a party or a corporate event, I think it would make an amazing venue.",

I started with the Boyd and Blue, a cocktail with blueberries and ginger - YUM!!!! No one else ordered a cocktail, but they were happy with their beverage selection.  We started with salads and soups, one was brave and ordered the stinging nettle soup, which the waiter said tasted similar to artichokes. It was pretty decent. I ordered the dandelion salad, which was more just bacon and eggs on a few greens than salad, but the bacon was terrific.  I ordered the goat shoulder as an entree, which was falling apart tender and topped with pea shoots. I could have done without the shoots, as I didn't feel they complemented the dish at all. I tried my friend's shank ravioli, which was stuffed with meat and pretty darn tasty. It could have done well with a better sauce though. Husband and I split the Panna Cotta for desert, which was unexpectedly good (probably because I didn't know what panna cotta was before ordering it). Friends got the carrot cake and said it was good as well.  All in all a good restaurant to try. The combinations of the dishes leave me a bit befuddled, but I guess when you are trying new things you are going to make a few missteps.",

They loved the \"new\" space and suggested that we have a drink at their bar next door before dinner. The bar was very cool but the bartender was arrogant, rude and incompetent. I asked him for an ordinary vodka martini - while he was shaking it, I pushed the empty martini glass towards him as another bartender was in his way. He stared at me, told me that was his job and that he, not me, was the bartender. The martini was not a straight martini but one of his concoctions - not what I wanted and not what I ordered - but then I guess he knew better - after all, he was the bartender!! Then the bill arrived. There were six in our party and only four of us  had cocktails - however the bill came to $80+. I paid it and went to sit down at our table for dinner. The waitress came and advised us later that the bartender had overcharged us and that I would be given a credit for the overage. Well that never happened and, when I checked my statement today, my credit card was billed the entire amount. Finally, at dinner we ordered an bottle of wine - advertised as a 2012 vintage but, alas, that wasn't the case. 2014 was all they could manage without advising us of the change. By the way, the food was good but the tone of the evening was set by the service at the bar and it was impossible to enjoy the meal. I, nor any in our group, will ever return to Legume.",

Chicken was always one of those things that I'd never order at a nice restaurant - I'd always opted for steak or fish, which I can't make as well at home. But this chicken blew me away, and I know my next trip to Pittsburgh will include a trip to Legume for the chicken alone.  The rest of our meal was wonderful as well - chicken livers as appetizers, a fish dish as a main for my partner, and panna cotta and apple crisp as dessert. The apple crisp came with an ice cream that absolutely had to have been made in-house - it was just beautifully done, and all of the ice cream shops that I've been to just can't compare. Overall, I'd describe Legume's flavor profile as delicate and balanced. Everything is seasoned just enough for the natural flavors to shine.  Service is attentive and solid. We were there for a birthday; Legume not only accommodated a dietary restriction but also brought out candles.   Would recommend 11/10. It's been a while since I've raved about a restaurant, so I'm really glad I found Legume.",

    "text": "I think my husband summed it up when he said, \"It feels like the chef won a restaurant on a reality tv show and just didn't know what to do with it.\"  We went here for a special occasion but nothing, nothing made us want to stay.    * Service - awkward, inattentive, slow * Food - tasteless salads, excellent entrees, dessert missed the mark * Atmosphere - loud off putting music, empty strange decor, beat up bathrooms  I had higher hopes based on yelp reviews.  We had a 9:15 reservation and were not seated until 9:30, even though we could see empty tables.  Others who were waiting just decided to leave.  Our waitress should be fired.  She described the food in the most unappealing way possible: \"We don't have a lamb chop, instead we are substituting a lamb leg, it is cut in half at the bone, it has lots of sinew, tendons, connective tissue, so it is pretty chewy and tough, and it looks worse than a chop but it is still really good tasting.\"  And, \"Monkfish is really good like lobster, but it is a super gross looking, ugly fish.\"  Way to turn our stomachs.  Many different people waited on us.  The person clearing our salads put our dirty knives straight on the table.  At this price restaurant they should bring new silverware with each course, and if not, then at least don't put it straight on the wood top table.  They also cleared things too early, placed things awkwardly, didn't ask if we wanted drink refills.  Did anybody train this staff?  Menu: I understand seasonal cooking doesn't leave many options in January.  But I also think there is a real lack of invention here.  75% of all the dishes had escarole and fingerling potatoes.  It all just sounded the same.  Get more creative with what you have at this time of year.    Mussel salad was utterly flavorless.  I don't know how you can make a salad that has mussels, fennel, and caper berries that has no flavor.  It sounds impossible, but True.  The monkfish was delicious.  Well seasoned, big piece, tender, lovely tomato accompaniment.  Spanish mackerel was good.  Small.  Could have used a bit more sauce or flavoring.  Warm gingerbread came with ice cold quinces on top and was so slathered in whipped cream it looked like a three year old plated it.  The gingerbread was fine but the fruit should have been warm and saucy.  The whipped cream tasted like cool whip and was about 8 times too much.  At an odd moment, the music started blaring, the Smiths, which I love, and strange dance party music.  Just too off for this type of restaurant.  We had a strange oil lamp on our table that had a tiny blue flame.  There was a big empty wall behind us with a picture hook and no picture on it.  The bathroom has a strange shelf right when you walk in with q-tips and OB tampons in a tray.  Just so odd.  ****  UPDATE: The owner of the restaurant contacted me via yelp and addressed the above concerns point by point.  She did so very respectfully and with tact, which I appreciate.  They are sending me a gift certificate and the next time I am in Pittsburgh I will give this place another try and can hopefully leave a more positive review.  I am very impressed with how they handled this and am updating my 2 stars to 3 stars for the time being.",

    "text": "I've walked past Legume hundreds of times but have never gone in.  From the outside it looks quite small, but when you enter, the floor is quite large.  My girlfriend and I were seated in a comfortable area that was not crowded at all.  We started with wine and an appetizer.  We got the smoked bluefish pate.  It was a very well blended mix of flavors.  The fish was present with a nice smoked flavor perfect for the crispy bread for spreading.  As an entree, I got the beef cooked medium-rare.  It was cooked perfectly with many compliments.  It came with glazed carrots that were softened but still crunchy, radiccio that was crunchy and tender, and potatoes.  The meat was seasoned well and went well with everything on the dish.  One thing I noticed was the potatoes were not well seasoned but I figured this was by design, as they were not meant to be mashed potatoes, but authentic and rustic smushed potatoes.  My girlfriend had the bass.  It was tender and flaky with rice and a puree.  She absolutely enjoyed it.  For dessert, we got the chocolate truffle cake with whipped cream.  It was rich and delicious and the perfect ending to our meal.  The thing we enjoyed most about the meal was the fact that the wait staff was attentive, but not annoying.  We would definitely recommend Legume and the plant to plate philosophy it conveys.",

    "text": "Disclaimer:  Legume is another \"I wish I could use half stars\" kind of place.  On almost every front (ambiance, service, food, etc.) it delivers, but for some reason, it's just missing the \"magic\".  I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt because I've had not one, but two great meals here within two months time (and consistency in this business is hard to come by!).  The combination between Legume and its accompanying bar, Butterjoint, is one to be reckoned with.  While I'm typically a beer guy, the cocktails I sampled on both occasions (plus one visiting Butterjoint itself) were solid.  Relative to appetizers, I highly recommend any of the pates or tartars the make the menu for that night (they feature a seasonal menu that changes daily).  In addition, one of the cheapest options on the menu, the goat cheese and pepper crostini ($5), is one of the best!  Both of my entrees were great.  The duck confit course on my first visit nailed that delicate balance between tender, perfectly cooked meat and that addictive crunchy skin that offsets its texture and the pork/poultry combo for my second was delicately prepared and well balanced.  On both occasions, the Shaker Corn side was the star of the show.  Dried corn that's re-hydrated and cooked in mini cast iron skillets with a creamy sauce.  Best of all, my desserts in both cases were great, my favorite being the knock-out banana and chocolate chunk cake with pecans, banana anglais and salted caramel ice cream (the fat kid in me was in heaven).  I will definitely be back in the future.",

Now that I'm a poor postgrad this is definitely my \"Moooom, buy me dinner cuz I'm visiting!\" place. I adore their bluefish pate, all their soups, the chicken under a skillet, and the ricotta ravioli. The desserts are always good too, especially the gingerbread and the rice pudding they have during the winter. They also used to have this dynamite cold brew coffee--bring that back! It's nice to have a place dedicated to farm to table and local produce, and Trevett and Sarah, the owners, are so nice and open about what they do and how they source their food. Trevett's love for this food definitely comes through in what's on your plate!  The cocktails come from their bar next door; I am a sucker for tiki drinks and I can highly recommend the Shark Tank. It even comes with a cocktail umbrella! Now that's the kind of attention to detail that counts.",

    "text": "Legume is a beautiful restaurant with an extremely quaint and relaxing atmosphere.  You really get the \"home comfort\" feeling here and the service is great.  The menu being updated basically daily is a definite plus and you can taste this in the freshness of their preparation in the restaurants dishes.  For an appetizer I enjoyed the Chicken Liver and Bacon bits, it was just so perfect an amazing sauce and done on a crostini, the way liver should be presented. For an  Entree I enjoyed their halibut and the girlfriend had the Yellowfin Tuna, both were excellent.  Perfectly tempered, well seasoned and accompanied well.  To speak for the Halibut it was very light but a good portion size and presented well with the summer squash and mushrooms.  The only disappointment was due to the fact that the restaurant prepares all meals fresh and only as many as they think will be served nightly the result is a few dishes selling out for a saturday night.  For example we were unable to try the Beef Tartar because they had just run out half an hour earlier and The Beef Liver entree was sold out aswell.  I grabbed the last Chicken Liver App.  Next visit will be at an earlier time than 8pm to try all this great restaurant has to offer.  One of the best in pittsburgh and a great wines by the glass selection.",

    "text": "My husband and I had a quick getaway weekend to Pittsburgh and looked for some of the highest rated restaurants on Yelp and Legume seemed to fit the bill. They were not that busy on a Friday night (the hostess said that the university had cleared out the week before), and we were seated promptly and tended to in a timely manner. We started with amazing pickled radishes with an aoli sauce--the radishes kept their bite but were salty and crunchy. The bread that they brought to the table was amazing--crunchy crust, warm, great crumb.   My husband had a leek and asparagus cream soup (cold) with meyer lemon and chive, that was basically cream with some asparagus and leek flavor (very good). I had a mixed salad which was fine, dressing was light and nothing super special.   The entrees were amazing--their menu rotates from day to day so there's always something new. I had a Bluefish with Carolina Gold Rice, Ramp Bulbs, Asparagus, Pea Shoots and Rhubarb Gastrique. The fish was just a touch under done, but it was actually better this way because it was flavorful and held together. It's been a strange trend recently that they ask you how your want your fish cooked--I've never said \"rare\" but this would have been what I want if I did. A quick sear to get a crunchy outside but with body on the inside.   My husband had the Crispy Farro with Asparagus, Golden Ferns, Farmer's Cheese, Maitake Mushrooms, Green Garlic Salsa Verde and Pea Shoots. The farro came out in little crackers that you could pile all the ingredients on and make small open face sandwiches.   I think the best part of the meal was dessert, where we had a light, vanish-in-your-mouth chocolate truffle cake with handmade whipped cream. I've not had a chocolate cake that airy before.  All of this, plus a glass of wine and two beers for $105. Stellar.",

    "text": "Just went here for my wife's birthday dinner... within minutes, she said it reminded her -- in both menu and atmosphere -- of some of the better 'foodie' restaurants in Portland, OR, where we used to live.  If this is any sign of the rise of great restaurants in Pittsburgh that we are hearing about, this trend might be for real.  We began with two apps - A grilled escarole salad, with so many other little goodies all in a perfect light but tangy dressing... awesome.  The other app was Bluefin pate.  Yes, that's right - Bluefin pate.  It kind of tasted a little like a salmon spread cross-dressing with some good whitefish... beats and other root vegetables, to go along with the crestinis and regular bread, made it a culinary delight.  We then ordered two mains... pork loin (beautiful) and lamb shank.  I hadn't had lamb in about 20 years, and pork loin in about 15 years.  Both were locally-sourced and grass-fed, well-portioned, cooked perfectly, sauced nicely, and had enough sides to keep it interesting.    We concluded with two desserts... the chocolate truffle cake which everyone else has written about and of course was lovely; but also, the gingerbread with poached quince.  The gingerbread and quince had so many layers of flavors and spices that my wife said it was EVEN BETTER than the chocolate cake.    Service was very good, as was the atmosphere.  You kind of don't want to leave, which is a good sign.  Left satisfied, and still experiencing the flavors.    The place is not cheap, though not absurd.  It is in that 8-10 app; 25-30 main; and 7-9 dessert range that seems to be the sweet spot for Pittsburgh... the only variance is that some new Pitt restaurants earn it, and others don't.  Legume does.",

    "text": "Fine Dining in the Burgh!!   While we had made reservations for a nice steakhouse in Robinson, we were appalled by people in gym clothes and Pjs and had to move our fine dining aspirations to Legume. Best decision ever!!   Parking is plenty - street, valet (validated) or metered lot. You can enjoy a great date night at Legume and hang out at Butterjoint (restaurant bar next door) after dinner if you wish.  Now it is difficult to review the dishes in a place that changes its menu very regularly as you may not see the same dishes that I ate and enjoyed, so I shall focus on the reasons you should dine at Legume.   1) This place has been on Pittsburgh Magazine Best Restaurants for atleast 3 years 2) Service is amazing - polite staff, extremely helpful, recommendations are not based on priciest item on the list but that cater to what you want to eat, servers have a good idea of the food i.e. tried and tested, prompt yet not rushed. 3) Farm-to-table restaurant means you get dishes with fresh produce and which are different every time you go there (unless you go there everyday) 4) The food is not that expensive for fine dining 5) You can get the bartender at Butterjoint to whip up a custom drink for you 6) You have some vegetarian options that are just as good as the meat options 7) The Pate and Crostini is a must try appetizer 8) Chocolate Truffle Cake will melt in your mouth 9) Portions are perfectly sized that will leave you full but not stuffed (assuming you eat 1 appetizer + 1 entree + 1/2 dessert) 10) Chef is a 2013 James Beard semi-finalist for Best Chef - Mid Atlantic (if that rocks your boat)",

    "text": "While looking for fancy dinner options we settled on Legume & were lucky enough to get a dinner reservation at short notice.   Legume shares a corridor with its sister bar: Butterjoint. The low lighting, decor & soft music all set the stage for a perfect date night.   We started off the night by with some wine which was pretty good, what made it better was our waitress. I was unable to decide between two wines (white & rose). Seeing my indecision, she offered a tasting of both to help make a choice(now that's service!)   For appetizers we got the pork duck pistachio pate & the arugula salad with warm mushrooms. I am not a big fan of pate & almost never order salad at a restaurant( why order something you can easily whip up at home & pay the big bucks while at it?). After tasting that pate & salad I have to say I'm reformed!!! I never knew you could instill so many flavors into such a simple dish...a SALAD!! The mushroom was the True star of that plate. Flavorful, perfectly cooked & totally delicious!!!   For the entree my date had his mind set on the steak & for the sake of variety, I decided to order the lamb chops ( one of the pricer entrees on the menu). You would think that no server would deter you from ordering something that is pricey & way larger portion than you can eat...what do they care right?? Nope... Not here!! Our server instantly pointed out the large portion of the dish guessing I would not want to/or be able to eat a 10 oz lamb chop. On asking her for recommendations she suggested the Farro (a legume)which was not only a vegetarian dish but also the least expensive entree. Another peeve of mine is never to order a vegetarian dish at a restaurant. Past experiences have taught me that they are usually bland, tasteless & leaves me with a feeling of money down the drain. Willing to take a risk I decided to heed her words & get the Farro.... Best decision!!! Never have I had a vegetarian meal (especially of a non Indian cuisine) that tasted that great! I have no words... It was a meal stopper! The steak was top notch too but I was too involved in the Farro to really notice!  We wrapped up our meal with the restaurant's signature dessert:the chocolate truffle cake. Probably the weakest dish of the evening,not because of its own flavors, only because it was compared to the high standards set by the prior dishes.   Overall: I have to say that this dining experience changed several of my well set ideas of dining out (I'm a whole new women!) Legume epitomizes what fine dining is all about... Stellar food, wonderful setting, perfect ambiance & staff who are attuned to their diners as well as their potential needs... All in all a five star experience!!!",

July is vegetarian month, and all of the vegetables were very good, even the chickpea stew, which had enough spices and greens to be delicious, and the borscht and steak tartare were even better (the kitchen had run out but was able to make us a half-portion).  That brings me to the service, which was excellent.  Our server was incredibly fun and helpful with my food allergies, and an expert on the food.  The wine list had a lot of great options, and the cocktail bar next door is a great place to hang out before or after dinner!  My only quibble would be with the dessert--the pavlova was overbaked and far too sugary, making it very dry.  Overall though, a great experience; we'll definitely return the next time we're in Pittsburgh!",

We went for a date night and were happy to see that there were actually vegan options on the menu and they were happy to assist in veganizing items that could be. They had tempeh which is awesome because vegan/vegetarian restaurants rarely consider well rounded nutrition and skimp on the protein.   The tempeh \"steaks\" were done really well and all the flavours were wonderful.  We had a hummus style starter which was also great. Cocktails were on-point and the service was lovely. The ambience was intimate and relaxing which was perfect for a date on a colder early winter night.   Down side? No vegan dessert. Poo.",

Their menu is small, but it has a little something for everyone - two in our party were vegetarians.  I was impressed by the food here and the super-attentive service.  Highlights:  1. Black Manhattan - Highly recommended and a pretty strong drink.  Named because of the black walnut bitters which imparted a unique aftertaste.  2. Free bread was amazing - crispy edges and soft interior, and the butter was soft and creamy.  3. Grilled Escarole with Jowl Bacon - A nice appetizer salad where the flavors really popped.  I actually liked the bitter greens and how the mustard vinaigrette dressing imparted some tartness.  And who can so no to bacon, especially jowl bacon - we're having soul food after all.  4. Chewy Steak Bavette - Similar to hangar steak.  I got this medium rare per the house recommendation.  Incredibly juicy and flavorful meat here.  They had a small side of couscous and another grilled veggie - some sort of endive which soaked up the red sauce well.  Highly recommended restaurant.  Upscale comfort food where veggies are featured prominently.",

    "text": "Legume is a great restaurant for a date. The tables are spread apart providing a personal and intimate atmosphere. The lighting is dim which adds romanticism. The service is quick, knowledgable, and attentive which assures you'll have a pleasant dining experience.  We started with the pork and pistachio pate along with the goat cheese and black pepper jam crostini. I like the former more than the later. I found the goat cheese too poignant for my liking. The pate had a Eastern European influence. It was quite savory with a hint of nuttiness from the pistachios.   For our main course, we shared the wild sea bass. It came with a delicious tomato vinaigrette. It had a wonderful array of flavors and a great balance between creaminess and lightness. I'd certainly recommend the dish if it's available.  I disliked that they were out of a couple dish which we tried to order. On the other hand, they did have a fair list of craft beers and cocktails.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to Legume for their \"Cheap Date Night\" - three courses for two for $50. This was my first time visiting Legume. The meal included your choice of soup, entree, and dessert and also offered $5 drink deals.  The ambiance is simple, clean, and modern, but the candles and wooden tabletops warm the space up. It also appears there are several larger tables which would make this space good for groups. I'd recommend the round table near the kitchen if booking a table for 6. Better for conversation than a rectangular table. The staff is also very friendly and attentive, without making you feel rushed.  We started with something off the standard menu. It was a hot slice of raclette with pickled vegetables on top. This gooey cheese paired very well with the crusty bread at the table. Highly recommend it!  For the three-course menu:  FIRST COURSE Me: Moroccan Lentil soup with creme fraiche and cilantro Boyfriend: spicy beef soup with kimchee, creme fraiche, and cilantro  Verdict: Morroccan Lentil soup was lighter than I expected, which was perfect given it was part of three-course meal. The  beef soup was also good and subtly spicy.   ENTREES Me: sausage with potato smash and endive (or Radicchio) Boyfriend: sweet potato (or was it butternut squash?) ravioli with mushrooms  Verdict: Both dishes were good, though I preferred the ravioli. There was a sweetness to the sausage or some sauce that was on the greens that really complimented the bitterness of the greens.   DESSERT Me: chocolate cake with whipped cream on top Boyfriend: sorbet with chocolate shavings and meringue sticks  Verdict: The cake had an almost mousse-like texture which was delightful, though rich (which we expected). The sorbet essentially tasked like a key lime pie and was my favorite for the two.   Overall, I would definitely go back to try their standard menu, but it is on the pricer side so it's worth keeping an eye out for their \"cheap date night\" specials.",

Then we shared the ricotta ravioli (which was my absolute favorite- I can't stop thinking about it!) and the rib stake (which was cooked to perfection and so savory!). We finished with a piece of chocolate cake with fresh cream- which was also delicious. When we were done we we next door to the bar (Butterjoint) for an after dinner drink.

We started off with the blue cheese egg tart on salad (it had a fancy name can't remember now) on top of some beets and greens. Served just warm, the tart itself was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and complemented the salad well.  I ordered a fish dish which was amazing. It was a white fish (bass or tilefish?) served with this really nice  tangy sauce which made it incredible. It was the perfect flavor combination that made each bite burst with flavor. It had some roasted veggies on the side. My husband got their beef dish and I thought the sauce it came with also made the dish amazing. They know how to make unique, savory sauces to perfectly complement the meats, and all the meats were cooked just right!!  I thought the dessert was just OK. I think it was cardamom ice cream served on top of rice, but the rice was not that great.  Overall, a great dining experience. I would definitely come back and eat another meal!",

Food: the food was excellent. I ordered the pear salad and the vegetarian entree. The polenta was creamy and crisp, the vegetables were accented well. My only downside was I wasn't totally full when I left. My friend ordered the steak though, and he had a solid amount of food.

By opening his first restaurant, Legume, a decade ago, Trevett Hooper opened Pittsburgh to a new generation of forward-thinking chefs that now inhabit much of urban Pittsburgh. Legume was one of the first in the city, and still one of very few restaurants to do in-house canning, preserving, and curing. The result is delicious. The seasonal menus change often enough to never get tired of the cuisine, but not so frequently that you can't try every dish on the menu. I can't say that Legume has one specialty, but a personal favorite is the steak tartare with a side of tallow fries and aioli. Legume has something for everyone, and will certainly please all who enter.",

I let the not-so-friendly hostess know we needed to up the reservation from 7 to 9. She said \"We can do 8 but not 9.\" Ok?? Lol what's one more chair around the big table I clearly saw could fit 2 more. Whatever I've been a hostess and so I let it slide. Also the internet says they are open until midnight but the kitchen closes at 9 p.m. How not so very French!   Warning Cakeage Fee: Then my husband brings me a cake from Whole Foods and ask if we could serve it. Yes they could serve it for us! Ok great! For the low price of $4/person....Our own cake. Making it actually more than the cost of the cake.   Food, Wait I'm Still Hungry:  The food was expensive as you might guess from the $$$ and frankly nothing to write home about. I had the Bavette and some goat cheese appetizers. The beer from Voodoo was the best thing there! (Shoutout to Meadville!) It's about $30/plate for food that's actually worth about $15.   In Conclusion: All nine of us will probably not be back and will be telling everyone how they would not budge on their exorbatant \"cakeage fee.\" Happy Birthday from \"Lame-gume.\"",

Our server was great and fun. Her recommendations for appetizers and wine were spot on. we went pretty nuts and tried as much as we could: pickle plate, Hidden Hills raclette, vermont raclette (with kimchi - was super delicious), goat cheese and pepper jelly crostini, grilled cabbage, butter lettuce salads, shaker corn, pork chop, tenderloin, and the cassoulet. I had the cassoulet as it's one of my favorite things ever. I put my order in with the appetizers so it would come out with the other entrees (takes about 45 minutes to prepare). It was glorious. We had a few Mercy of the Bartender cocktails - all bourbon-based, all great. And then on to dessert. We ordered the mincemeat pie, the black walnut with salted caramel (I think?), and a few of the shortbread with lemon curd and pomegranate - everyones' favorite.   Stellar night all around.

Just know that our dishes included an Arctic Char that was perfectly cooked, as was a pork chop and pork shoulder.  Just fantastic.  Also, the coffee is french pressed and very, very good.  There is valet parking right across the street for $2 w/validation.  Also, I'm told it used to be a BYOB restaurant w/a $3 cork fee - but now it has a full bar, so it's still BYOB but the cork fee is $15.  It falls short of 5 stars because our service wasn't great.  The staff were friendly, water refills and such were timely, but we had nearly 25 minutes between our apps and entrees.  In that interval, we didn't see a single person.  Also, desert was brought out well before our coffee, so we were basically done with the desert by the time it finally came.  Someone also mentioned the small portion sizes, but this was not the case at all.  Unless you and your friend are Joey Chestnut and Kobiyashi in preparation for the Nathan's hot-dog eating contest, you have well-sized plates.  If you just want great food and aren't too much of  service snob, this place is 5 stars.  Even despite the service glitches, it's a great meal.",

    "text": "I was just in Pittsburgh for a night and had the great fortune of eating there.  The experience left me excited to return to Pittsburgh just for another meal at Legume--it was that good!  My mother and I came on a rainy Thursday evening.  The staff was gracious to still seat us despite being nearly forty minutes late.  I found the atmosphere and the staff very warm and inviting.  Quiet and not hectic.   My mother and I started with the  'massaged' kale salad with a fried poached egg.  'What's 'massaged' kale??,'  I asked the helpful waitress.  It's exactly how it sounds people--they massaged the kale to soften its texture and it really did help.  The kale was more soft and less scratchy as it can be when it doesn't receive such luxurious prep.  The fried poached egg I think was a bit over the top.  If they would have stopped at poaching the egg then I think the salad would have been perfect in its simplicity.    The dish that really won me over though was the wild salmon with golden North Carolina rice and asparagus.  I ate the whole thing--every last bite and I rarely accomplish this in a restaurant because if I'm not over the moon about a dish I won't continue eating it.  This was worth it.  The fish was perfectly cooked, seasoned and just tasted so fresh.  My mother had the ricotta ravioli of which I tried and the filling was generous and bursting with cheesy goodness.    For dessert we shared the rhubarb crisp--bam!  More delish goodness: warm, buttery and simple in its melding of tart, crunchy and perfectly sweet.  Ugh, now I'm hungry.  Can't wait to come back to Pittsburgh!",

Son's lamb kielbasa was excellent.  Wife splurged for quail and pork entree - nice, but didn't generate the same \"oohs and ahs\" as the fish and kielbasa.  Atmosphere: Menu might give the impression of pretentiousness, but service and decor are not.  Perfect for our group.    Service:  Outstanding.  Attentive when needed, left to linger and talk when appropriate - paced the service to our needs (relaxing, but got us on our way to the symphony without delay).  Server recommended a Spanish red wine (with fish and quail?) and it was a delightful surprise that enhanced the meal.",

    "text": "Outstanding is a word I rarely use to describe a restaurant but Legume is deserving of such praise because it is just that good. I hadn't dined at the first location but my wife had and she says good things. We tried the new location one chilly and drizzly Friday evening and the place was buzzing. Good sign. Service was a bit shaky at first (we seemed to have been forgotten...but maybe it was because we were tucked away in a far corner of the room and the staff were still getting used to the space). Fortunately service improved over the course of the evening.   We had a great meal. Prior to moving to Pittsburgh we lived in France for two years, slightly outside of Paris. While the living in France experience wasn't all \"rainbows and unicorns\" joyous, the food was of course great a lot of the time. Many of the dishes we had at Legume reminded us of happy dinners we had enjoyed in France. There was clearly a Gallic influence on the kitchen and what impressed us was the expert execution. French food when done well means simple ingredients prepared perfectly or more complexity that is pulled off effortlessly. This is what Legume's kitchen did. We enjoyed the baked fetta (reminded us of baked cheese courses in France), duck confit, beef, and swordfish. Everything was delicious and perfectly balanced and executed with apparent ease. Dessert was less memorable (honestly, I don't remember...apple something maybe?!).  Overall a great experience and really one of Pittsburgh's premier restaurants.  Oh, and Jeff G's previous review mentioned parking... The garage under the building across the street does valet. With validation I think it was maybe $2.",

    "text": "We finally made it to the new location after frequenting the old Regent Square digs for a couple years.  The new spot seems like a bit of a risk, as there's not much else on that stretch of Craig St.  So the fact that it's still packed is a good sign that Legume's reputation is well-cemented by now.    I'm glad that they're successful and can open the now much larger restaurant, but I confess that I'll always like the old space better.  It's admittedly a matter of personal preference but I find the new space to be a touch too stuffy.  I liked Regent Square's DIY-aesthetic, intimacy and less formal vibe.  Don't get me wrong, the new spot isn't Lemont-level fuddy-duddy...I just prefer a more relaxed atmosphere.    On to what really matters: the cuisine.  As before, Legume offers rotating selections based on market availability and freshness, and the results usually impress.  While it's not on the cutting edge of culinary innovation, I find the dishes here straightforwardly tasty. It's an approach that showcases the high-grade ingredients, and that's hard to fault.  This time I went for the braised veal on the waiter's suggestion and it didn't disappoint...the slow cooking resulted in impossibly soft texture, and the preparation was flavorful without being overly salty.  I also recommend the ginger cake for dessert...they're not afraid to serve a dish with substantial ginger bite and I appreciate that it's not a half-hearted version intended for bland-palate, mass-appeal.    I also went for the classic blood & sand cocktail and this version was good.  Pretty sure they used fresh juice which is always welcome.  I prefer a scotch with a bit more smoke in the flavor profile, say Famous Grouse (Chivas is used here), but overall I'd recommend the drink, especially if you've never tried it before.  Perhaps I've been overly picky about the new space, and maybe it will grow on me.  For sure, the cooking is good enough that it remains highly recommended.",

Our order of food arrived within a short time. We really enjoyed the beef tartare, blue cheese/oat biscuits/apples/candied walnuts, and mackerel/crispy potatoes. We felt just OK about the chicken because it was a little plain. My husband said that the menu was well-thought-out, but he would have preferred a steak or salmon. The crust on the bread was a little hard to chew. I liked how customers could wear business casual or casual attire depending on their preferences. The waiter refilled our drinks regularly. The seats were not cushiony. The decor was nice to look at.",

Being from Spain I find it hard to get a decent Gazpacho in the US. I have to say that the one I had in Legume was probably the best Gazpacho I have had outside Spain. The funny thing is that Legume is not a Spanish restaurant at all. Still, they absolutely got the right amount of spiciness and garlic in. I then had Pierogies. I am not an expert on that (in fact it was my first time having them). But, I found the dish to also be delicious. I finished with an awesome desert. Only minor complaint is that they did not have espresso to go with it. But, overall a fantastic dinner.",

Beautiful hand crafted wood abounds from the hands of local talent and a stately old bar create a perfect atmosphere for enjoying craft brews and creative cocktails while listening to locally grown music .  The atmosphere compliments the food: and old fashioned wholesomeness accompanies seasonally fresh ingredients in a creative, and of course, delicious way.   The presentation of the food has improved, while the flavors remain the same. From Pate's to the best Halibut I have ever consumed, I won't stop going back to Legume.   Their new location simply made a great concept even better. It remains a staple in the burgeoning local/seasonal food movement in Pittsburgh.",

But I just went to legume, a brand new restaurant in Regent Square, and couldn't wait to Yelp about it!  Legume feels like it should be in San Francisco... the unassuming brick front hides a light and bright interior. Tin ceiling, school house lighting, botanical prints, antique mismatched furniture... a great ambiance! I would live inside this place. seriously.  They don't try to get away with just looking pretty (this sadly often happens with new restaurants in pgh). The food was quite good as well. I had a vegetarian stew (perfect portion size, tasty and fresh!) along with the watermelon gazpacho which was spicy and refreshing.   Don't be fooled by the name either. They have meat dishes too, two types of steak on the menu when I visited. Supposedly the menu changes all the time which is also reassuring. Definitely worth trying, and if you don't like it you can always cross the street to Dee's and get some hotdogs afterwards. ;-]",

    "text": "ONE OF THE BEST MEALS I HAVE HAD IN THE 'BURGH!  My 80 year old father was visiting from out of country, so I looked for someplace nice to take him, near where he was staying in Oakland...someone suggested we try Legume.  I owe that person a huge thanks....  The dining room is lovely, and quite large, with non intrusive music (important when dining with an 80 year old).  The daily menu, though short, had very interesting choices, and was not overwhelmingly expensive.  We started with a shared plate of Steak Tartare...hard to find in this city, and rarely done correctly (the meat should be chopped, NOT ground, and the accompaniments, which have been figured out over a couple centuries, are perfect for the dish).  Well, this was just delicious and was just a few capers (oddly not included) away from perfection.  For entrees, he went with the duck leg confit, which he declared divine and thoroughly demolished, while I had the Spatchcocked Chicken (Here called chicken cooked under a pan)...My chicken was beautifully seasoned and perfectly cooked, with the crispiest skin I have ever encountered on a poultry dish...the smashed potatoes and greens with confit garlic were wonderful, and the sauce was absolutely astounding in its richness and silky texture.    We actually skipped dessert, since we were both so full after the meal...  Overall, an amazing meal, and a restaurant I will return to.  SPECIFIC NOTES: A: For those on dates, they actually had mouthwash in the mens' room (useful after confit garlic.  B: On Mondays, they apparently do a brunch, for people in the restaurant business (restaurant workers get a special price on this)",

Our  concerns evaporated as soon as we stepped inside. It is bigger but the space is sectioned and the tables nicely separated. We checked out the kitchen; it is large, well organized and exceptionally clean. Parking is just across the street and costs $2.  The food was excellent. We started with a beet salad that was served with a blue cheese souffle and a garlicky sauteed escarole salad that had delicious little chunks of thick bacon made from the jowls of the hog. Main courses were a perfectly cooked, tender, iron steak on a very tasty mushroom risotto and an equally good braised veal breast with rice grits with a great rosemary sauce. We ordered two side dishes; Brussel sprouts with anchovies that was ok, but not great, and a homemade kimchi that was mildly spicy and quite good. We were too full for dessert  The overall dinner was great as was the service, and well worth the cost. This is genuinely fresh, made from scratch, food that has retained all of its goodness with the transition to a scale that will allow Trevett Hooper and his team to do new things that were not possible in a smaller space.",

Incredible dinner, but let me explain the four-star rating. I would give five stars, but the service was only worth 3. Our plates sat on our table for what felt like forever before being cleaned, and we were only asked once or twice how everything was. Granted, they were pretty full, but still...good service always makes a difference. We were busy catching up so I didn't mind the empty plates/so-so attentiveness like I might have at another time.  On to the important stuff. The food. was. amazing. I'm still kind of fantasizing about it. New favorite dish might be their lamb tartare. Melt in your mouth uncooked heaven. Obviously lamb's flavor is strong, so I think you've got to really like tartare to go for this, but it was incredible so you should try it even if you're not a huge fan whenever they have it next.  We also had the pork and pistachio pate which was very nice. Paired well with our wine.   I had the mackerel after my tartare...definitely could not have fit in a full entree and had room for dessert (which would have been a mortal sin). The fish was presented beautifully, clean and crisp lines. It was very salty alone, but with a taste of the rhubarb chutney was FANTASTIC. I've never had fish pair so perfectly with something. It cut through and was worth all the bones I had to maneuver around. (I also will add I appreciated the presentation in full fish form as it would have definitely lost its charm if it was boned etc.)  My dining mate had the spelt and wasn't as estatic, but still pleased. The ricotta and greens were tasty, but the spelt had a very greasy aftertaste.   Hokay. The dessert. We got the choclate truffle cake and panna cotta. I am glad I appropriated the panna cotta because I was kind of full and could not have stopped myself from devouring the chocolate.   ALSO THE HONEY. On the panna cotta there was a bit of honey comb and combined with a bit of the lavender cookie I thought I had accidentally eaten from the tree of life and was about to be cast out into the cold, cold world where food like this could never exist.  In short....I'll be back. Maybe tonight :)",

Our server was knowledgeable and shared great details about the menu. We enjoyed the racalett and beef tartare appetizers. Both were phenomenal! Also had the smoked kielbasa and pierogies and the braised lamb. I'd have to say the lamb was some of the best I've ever had. All around 5 stars for atmosphere, service and menu.",

    "text": "Yes.  Yes Yes yes Yes.  My experience at Legume last night is in a close running for my best Pittsburgh restaurant experience, ever...  As many have mentioned, I was a bit skeptical of their move to North Oakland of all places. While N.Craig St doesn't have much draw in and of itself, it does seem like a somewhat central location, I'll give them that. I'm not sure how to describe the decor, I'm very curious what the space was pre-Legume, but it feels a lot like a dimly lit 1950's hotel foyer.  At any rate, I don't care about all that. The food was comfortably spectacular. The pork pate was creamy and delectable, but nothing too unseen. My barley risotto, hangar steak, carrot purree dish was cooked to perfection as was my partner's faro, goat cheese, plate. Another friend had duck confit with an apple chutney that made for candy on the plate. The food, in all, was perfectly executed but within a certain comfort zone of a new-american palate.  The service was 6 stars. We had to wait quite a bit of time for our main food service, and the manager and server more than adequately compensated for this. The server was friendly, and very knowledgeable about plates, wines, or desserts when asked.  In all, if you're really digging on some perfect seasonal new-american food, check this out. Just don't expect to be hit over the head with flavor profiles you've never experienced.",

    "text": "Oh legume -- you are forgiven for leaving me. I know now that I have not been forsaken, I just have to drive to see you now. What once was an extremely tiny neighborhood joint with aspirations that could not be contained in its diminutive space, is now a vast elegant (but not overbearing) restaurant in the city's academic center. There is little charming about N. Craig St., so like others, I was highly skeptical of the move. Thankfully for the food scene in Pittsburgh, Trevett and Sarah are savvier business folk than us Regent Square homers.   The new space is open, subdued, and pleasantly quiet. I would like to see them get some more art up--in the section where we were seated, the creamy walls were entirely blank. I was very happy to find the same lovely, warm staff--ever maintaining a wonderful balance between friendly familiarity and fabulous professionalism. Service is usually only mentioned in the negative, and it worth taking a second to really give legume kudos for collecting, cultivating, and keeping a truly remarkable, knowledgeable, and pleasant staff who clearly care about the food they serve and making sure that you enjoy it. I had been to legume's former location a number of times, and this has been a consistent experience.   Then there is the reason so many of us became loyal visitors to the itsy bitsy bistro on S. Braddock Ave--the food. Oh my, oh my. Trevett Hooper and the kitchen staff of legume love food, and it shows. Like many other Pittsburgh restaurants (isn't it awesome that I can write that!?!), they seek out locally-sourced vegetables, meat, and cheeses, so the ingredients are fresh and of very high quality. Ingredients are combined in creative, mouthwatering dishes, and perfectly executed.   This particular evening, I was taking my mother out for an early birthday celebration. I was glad when she chose the lobster ravioli with chives and parsnip puree ($29), as I knew she would love it, and she did. I was also impressed that, instead of going for the boring cream sauce option, the chef instead used the lobster stock to cook down a reduction with which the fresh pasta wrapped raviolis were glazed.  I started out with the curly endive salad with blue cheese mustard vinaigrette, pear, and candied walnuts ($9). The endive was not bitter at all and the flavors played beautifully off each other. The salad came dressed, but it was perfect--flavorful, but no dressing puddle on the bottom of the plate. Mom had the rutabaga pear soup with pancetta and croutons, which I totally would have ordered if it were vegetarian. She claimed that it was well-balanced, with the pear's mild sweetness brightening up the earthy rutabaga.  If you like meat and care about the animals from which they come, legume should quickly earn a regular spot in your restaurant rotation. On the other hand, if you are a vegetarian like me, you will also find much to love at Legume. The veg options are always more limited, but:  1) they're always well-thought-out and creative; 2) the servers understand what vegetarian means and will direct you appropriately, e.g., when going over the dessert menu, Jason let me know that the pound cake had lard in it; 3) They're always willing to work with you. If you are vegan or have other dietary restrictions, they ask that you give them a call in advance, and they'll do their best to work something up for you; And, 4) Most important, they are delicious!   I had the crispy spelt with sweet potatoes (pureed), mushrooms, house-made ricotta, shaker dry roasted corn, and sweet and sour cabbage ($18). I wasn't entirely sure what I was getting myself into, but was not disappointed when I took my first bite. Artfully arranged in layers and topped with a crispy spelt \"cracker\", the flavors blended perfectly with each bite -- the lightly sweet sweet potato, savory mushroom, lightly rich ricotta, and the sweet-tart bite from the cabbage were delightful.   I finished off dinner with the warm gingerbread topped with poached quince and whipped cream. If you are a fan of dark molasses gingerbread, I give this a hearty thumbs up. My mom opted (despite being \"too full\") for the toasted pound cake with vanilla ice cream, poached kumquats, and caramel sauce. She said it was delicious, but could have done with a bit more caramel sauce. (Based on visual observation, I would agree, however, it should be noted that moms could drink a mug of caramel sauce.)   I have been quite remiss in reviewing the places I've dined recently, so the fact that I took a menu with me (w/permission!) to ensure that I would not forget anything in my review should be an indication of how much I enjoyed my experience.   PS: A note on cost -- I marked the place as \"spendy,\" because it is, but the entree prices are very reasonable, both for size and quality. Obviously, you aren't going to get Cheesecake Factory portions here (thank goodness), but you'll definitely have enough to eat.",

    "text": "Legume is definitely a restaurant to try in Pittsburgh.  Pros: The service is perfect from the moment they take your coat to the personalized drink recommendations that you can ask for.  The menu was very unique, and the ingredients were high-quality. The daily menu is a fun experience, knowing that your meal is truly one-of-a-kind. My boyfriend had quail which he rated 5/5 and I had the vegetarian tempeh which I would give a 4/5. The Baked Alaska dish was fantastic 5/5.   Cons: At 7pm on a Tuesday night, the place was fairly empty, and I wished that it were more lively. The music was pleasant, but the songs did not flow from one song to another. I think a lot of people come after work, since they are in professional attire (we went in casual). This is a restaurant to enjoy the food, not so much the atmosphere.   The prices are expensive ($90 including tip for 2 drinks, 2 entrees, and a shared dessert), but that was to be expected.   The daily menu is interesting, but that meant that there were only a couple vegetarian options.",

    "text": "Wow, talk about commitment...to great food!  This place rocks and deserves all the superb reviews its received.  I ordered the Aubrey as a pre-dinner drink and wasn't all that fond of it, but I'll put the blame on myself more b/c I don't like champagne and was told that these drinks are lighter/bubbly in nature.  So not going to punish Legume for my poor judgment.  On to the entree, I got the barley risotto with flat iron steak and carrot puree and a wine sauce.  Wowzer - it was sooooo good.  I got my steak medium (rather than medium rare) and while it was still a little pink it was really tender.  The risotto, puree, and sauce were great compliments to the steak.  It was also a perfectly sized portion.    I chose the salted caramel ice cream for desert and it was surprisingly delicious.  I'm saying \"surprisingly\" b/c I was hesitant about getting the ice cream, thinking it may be too creamy or just not my taste, but it's exactly what I wanted!    My friends got the gingerbread desert and the other got to the chocolate truffle cake.  While I'm not a huge gingerbread fan - if you do like that flavor then get ready for a flavor explosion in your mouth!  Now I must admit I had a bit of truffle cake envy - it was heavenly!  And ideally I think it would have been amazing if they had a scoop of the salted caramel ice cream to accompany that cake or the cake as a great side to the ice cream.  You get my drift - pair them together and you'll be in desert heaven.  I would definitely recommend this place and look forward to more visits.",

I can order something that contains something I normally avoid, and I love it.   Edit: Once upon a time, Legume was BYOB. I was a little sad when they moved and got a liquor license. But their bar is a warmer, more intimate space than the rest of the restaurant, the bartenders and drinks are great, and they've got quite the bar special: $19 or so for app/salad, entree, and dessert. Another edit: That bar special is not always on the menu. It might have been a limited-time-only thing.  I will warn you: going to Legume could easily make many future experiences at previously favored restaurants disappointing in comparison.",

    "text": "For once, we've gone to a place and felt like we weren't fancy enough to be there (more on that later). I mean, we're nicely dressed people and all, but the formality of the previous restaurant still haunts the place.   Fear of talking too loudly aside, we had an amazing meal.  First of all, the biggest issue with every restaurant: were their cocktails good?  Yes! And accurate too! It pleases me so to see aperitifs and classic cocktails. Where else can you get a Blood and Sand? Answer: not sure, but I really enjoy theirs. It also made me so happy to see a proper Papa Doble. Hemingway would be proud - he would also devour the pork shoulder I had, braised in Applejack on top a square of perfect polenta. And possibly order a second. Seriously, the best piece of pork I've ever had.  The menu changes a lot depending on what the chef gets for the week or so. When we went it was pickled vegetable time, so I was disappointed not to be able order the tallow fries I saw weeks beforehand. But that's what a good restaurant does to keep you coming back.  The dining room needs to be warmed up a bit. It's minimalist without the minimalist design. I hear they're painting the walls, so that's a good sign. They are still new. However, our server (who was about the same age as us) was so polite and proper that it made me uncomfortable. Strange, I know, but I felt out-fancied.  One thing about the ambience I did love was the music. Light and hip, and a perfect balance.  We'll go back, but we'll be sitting at that gorgeous bar. It seems like a completely different restaurant in there.",

We both started our meals with a side of fries as an app, the fries were wonderful! I can't quite describe them, they are crispy and light and almost melt in your mouth. The menu changes daily, but the night I was there I had the lobster ravioli. It was probably the best lobster ravioli I have ever had, even better than some I've had at seafood restaurants or restaurants closer to fishing towns. The portion wasn't small, but it wasn't huge either, it was about right for a single meal with no leftovers. My boyfriend got the chicken and liked his dish as well, I tried a bite of his and the chicken was very juicy and tender. My friends also loved their steak and fish dishes. After eyeing up another table's dessert, we decided to get dessert too. We split a piece of chocolate cake with whipped cream. The cake was very rich, but the slice was small enough to be just enough for 2 people without feeling like it was too rich or too much. The whipped cream was very fluffy and good.   The service was excellent, the food is on the pricey side, but at the same time the portions were reasonable. This isn't a restaurant where you pay $35+ for a dish, and when it arrives it's about 5 bites. We will be back again! We also are going to check out the burgers at Butterjoint, the bar portion next door.",

I'm in!  PUMPKIN-MUSSEL SOUP: WHAT IS THE RECIPE? Dang this was delicious. I practically licked the plate clean.. (loved the chives!) It was a perfect, light appetizer, getting my taste buds excited for what the 2nd course would be like. SMOKED PORK KIELBASA: In my opinion, I thought that the sauerkraut didn't need to be there, but that's just personal as sauerkraut just isn't my thing. The kielbasa was very tasty! It was complimented well with the crushed potatoes and turnips although with those 2 looking quite similar in color, I was confused at first when I took a bite into the crunchy turnip. Haha. Presentation wasn't the key really here, as everything kind of had the same color scheme. My date's Bluefish dish looked better than mine.. CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE: I was so looking forward to this but was unfortunately disappointed. Dessert was supposed to be the banger of the meal to leave me feeling really good, but that wasn't the case here. I had expectations of the cake being sweet and decadent, but it had a very dark chocolate kind of taste. The whipped cream didn't look so tasty on top either. Ahh..  SERVICE: On point. Upon walking in, we had a reservation set for 7:45PM and we were seated right away (at a 4 person table although there were only 2 of us, not complaining but just thought it was funny). They were timely about refilling our waters and asking if our meal was okay.  ATMOSPHERE: Comfortable and casual yet still upscale. Dark but not Cheesecake Factory dark and still romantic. Little candle and small dried flower centerpieces. Can definitely hold a conversation fine here, as it isn't too loud or too quiet.  Overall, the experience of Legume was really nice. If I'm looking to splurge and not make the trip to downtown, Legume here I come. It's very likely the only time I'd come back is for the Cheap Date Night, because it's a deal I can't pass up.",

The ambiance is comfortably elegant, modern yet earthy.   The staff is knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and welcoming. Despite their sophistication, they welcome young children and revel in their enjoyment of fine food.   There is an accessible family bathroom, which is a huge plus.

However, I ordered their sea bass not expecting too much, mmm let me tell you, best sea bass I've ever had. We also waited for a loooooong time for our food, but we needed a relaxing night so we didn't mind. The restaurant took the time to apologize and treated us with free desserts. The desserts were also amazing, this is definitely an upscale restaurant where I actually think it's worth spending money at. I would come back, for sure :)",

    "text": "Generally outside of my college student budget, Legume is one of my top picks when family is visiting. I ate at Legume for the first time a few years ago, I had one of my favorite dishes ever: homemade spaghetti in a pesto sauce, with fresh sauteed radishes, and a fried egg on top. Unfortunately, I'm unlikely to ever see this menu item again. I've eaten there several times since and have menu items that were good, but not quite as great. Legume's menu changes frequently, which is a strength, but also a weakness. As Legume tries to source its ingredients from local farms, I feel that the restaurant struggles in the winter months when local fresh food supplies are low and . Moreover, it appears that the chef will toss experimental items on the menu; there are \"filler items\" on the menu that do not meet up to the quality of that dish I had the first time.  The servers are passionate and well educated about the food and the menu. They are more than willing to accommodate those with dietary restrictions and they try their best to make sure guests are satisfied. On my most recent visit I had a stinging nettle soup with creme fraiche and 12oz rib steak. The soup was a perfect starter. Savory and light. The rib steak was hefty and filling, delicious none the less, what one should expect with a fattier cut of meat. Legume's decor sets a mood for freshness, combining art that depicts scenes and creatures from nature, I feel at peace when entering the warmly lit establishment.  Bottom Line: Legume is a standout restaurant. Farm to table freshness, diverse, changing menus, and well crafted menu items are ensured. Service is top notch and friendly. However, the menu at times feels that the chef is experimenting, or trying to compensate with a lack of fresh ingredients available in Pittsburgh's cold months. Would recommend and will be returning!",

    "text": "We had a good dinner, but not $400 good. A table of 5, celebrating my son's graduation from Pitt, we had a 6:30pm reservation. First we ordered 2 bruschetta as an appetizer. There was one piece in each order (half a large slice of toast). Yummy, but very unusual - served with ricotta & white beans. A better description of both the portion & the ingredients would have been appreciated. Next, 3 of us got salads. Big enough to share. Wedge had 5 or 6 bacon crumbles & no tomato, but good. A server came to offer fresh ground pepper, put it on 1 of the 3 salads then left. There was no pepper on the table. Our entrees (4 rib steaks & 1 chicken) did not arrive until 8pm. The wait between courses was slower than an enjoyable \"leisurely\" pace. We ordered 3 med rare & 1 med steak. We got 3 med & 1 med rare. We elected not to send them back due to the wait. We shared a few desserts. The vinegar pie was outstanding, but others not special. When the bill came, it included a 20% gratuity. As former server, I am a generous tipper, but when the prices are high ($42 steak) & service just adequate, I think 15% is fair. I'm more likely to tip 20-25% or more at an inexpensive place where servers work just as hard or harder. In the future, we'll stick with breakfast at \"Pie for Breakfast\" or apps at \"Butterjoint.\"",

The black rye manhattan which involved walnut liqueur was excellent. So was the grilled escarole salad with pickled pineapple, parmesan, bacon and mustard vinaigrette. The salad made my entree selection difficult though. I wanted the steak, but it came with grilled escarole. I wanted the pork chop, but it came with pickled pineapple. It just would have been nice if none of the entrees duplicated such significant ingredients from the only salad on the menu. I went with the halibut with rice grits, baby bok choy and blood orange anchovy. It was good but didn't wow me like the first course did. I also got a side of kim chi just for fun which is a dish I normally love. Theirs was painfully spicy and really interfered with an otherwise pleasing palate experience. For dessert, which I only ordered to soothe my mouth from the kim chi, I had hickory nut cake with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge. The latter two components were the best part unfortunately. The other selections did sound great though.  You can skip this place, but if it's where you end up for whatever reason, you'll probably have a decent time.",

We finished with chocolate truffle cake, topped with a homemade whipped cream; it was rich but managed to be light at the same time - like the inside of a truffle.

    "text": "I ate here for dinner this past Saturday evening with my girlfriend and her friend.  The restaurant itself is situated on the bottom floor of what used to be an apartment building.  It looks nice and all of the tables are covered in white table clothes.  They also have a bar that is next door and is partially separated from the restaurant.  You can reach it from the restaurant but it is situated in such a way that it can stay open after the restaurant has already shut down.  For dinner we decided to start off our evening by getting an appetizer of fried pickled daikon.  The taste of the vegetable was almost completely covered by the flavors of pickling and fried batter but I still really enjoyed it.  After all, who doesn't love something that is fried.  I also decided to order a bowl of their corn chowder before the meal.  The top base was creamy and I was enjoying it until I dug to the bottom of the bowl and got was I originally thought was a hard/sour piece of corn.  After thinking about it for a minute though I soon realized that it was a shallot and proceeded to enjoy the savory creaminess of the soup with slightly sour taste of the shallot.  For my dinner entree I decided to have the lamb steak with a mint-rhubarb sauce and also ordered a side of the tallow fries with mayonnaise for the table.  Whenever I ordered the steak the waiter proceeded to inform me that it was not your normal lamb steak.  Due to where it had it been cut from, it would have two different types of meat as well as some connective tissue.  I told him that I was ok with that thinking it would be similar to a ribeye.  Well, I was wrong on that account as the meat was not what I expected and much of it was very hard to cut.  I can't say that I was not warned though.   Whenever I did get a good piece of the steak, I was very happy with both it and the sauce that was on top.  The vegetables that came with my meal were not anything special and I am actually struggling to remember what they were.  The fries were a different story though as they were both crispy and delicious.  Combining them with the mayonnaise also may have been considered heavenly if not for the realization that you were eating entirely too much fat.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here in the future.  Everything was fantastic except for my entree which was definitely my own fault and so I am looking forward to trying other things here!",

    "text": "I took my parents to Legume last summer when they came to visit me in PGH.  After dining at one of the more inexpensive-but-mediocre chain places at Station Square the night before, I wanted to treat them to dinner at a restaurant that exemplifies Pittsburgh's up-and-coming culinary scene.  So, after fighting the N. Oakland parking wars, off to Legume we went.  Given that I was paying, we kept the bill within reasonable limits by skipping appetizers and just ordering entrees, some fries to share, and dessert.  I forget what they ordered, but I ordered the salmon entree, and it was superb.  Extremely well-cooked, well-seasoned, and well-presented.  Impressive!  I forget what they ordered, but they were favorably impressed as well--although not as much as I would have liked them to be, since, being denizens of suburbia, they're used to chain casual dining places, rather than more upscale, innovative places like Legume.  The tallow fries, which come with aioli, made for a nice crispy accompaniment to our meals.  Dessert was also excellent--I ordered the dark chocolate truffle cake, which I split with my mom, and it was sinfully delicious.  In terms of food quality, I consider Legume almost exactly on par with Cure--although Cure had a slight advantage for entrees, and Legume for desserts.  They're both excellent, and well worth the price.  Service was attentive and helpful, but not overbearing or condescending--perfect for a fine dining establishment.  Overall, an excellent experience--highly recommended.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed this restaurant. I will say that due to the reviews posted I think my expectations were elevated pretty high, and so I could have been more impressed. Nevertheless, this place should be a staple among Pittsburgh foodies.   Food: The food was cooked very well. We had the scallops and the lamb, and both were cooked perfectly, and plated in a visually appealing manner. My only complain was that the foods seemed to be basically the same dish in terms of seasoning/marinades/dressing, but with a different source of protein. For a place like this I was expecting a little more originality with each dish. That should not at all take away from the fact that both were delicious.   Atmosphere: classy, and warm. The place was smattered with people wearing slacks and blazers, to people wearing jeans and flannel, which made me feel comfortable considering I was much closer to the flannel side of that scale.   Service: One kind of unique observation I made revolved around our waiter. The service he provided was fine, however his personality and diction was kind of, let's say, off. He came off confused and uncertain when speaking with us, and he didn't have much in the sense of recommendations food wise. This seemingly lack of familiarity with the menu and general social awareness is not normally something I would complain about but I can't say it went unnoticed or discussed throughout our meal, a time when we should probably be more focused on the food than the way our waiter talked.   All in all a great restaurant that I would very likely return to.",

We began with salads, his was grilled endive and mine was primarily heirloom tomatoes--both came uniquely presented and were very flavorful and satisfying.     For dinner I ordered mackerel and he ordered a short-rib ravioli--both delish!  Even the bean/potato side served with my meal was great.  I don't know if it was my imagination or not, but the portions seemed way bigger than the last time we were there.  I was full even though I gave 1/2 of my protein to my husband.  He also ordered the tallow fries, I tasted one and it was so good!  My favorite part of the meal was the pickled veggies--kind of like a kim chee, but better!  We ended up sharing one of the chocolate truffle desserts--my hubby loved it, I thought it was really good, too, but I'm not the chocolate fan that he is!  (I wanted the lemon verbena dessert)  Have to give props to the waitress as well (wish I could remember her name) she was very infomative and excited about the menu--which is really rare!    So glad we went back and gave this place a second chance!",

Granted, we visited the last place right before they moved, so they might have been in a state of transition, but the decor/ambiance here is great (fancy, but not stuffy, and with great paintings everywhere), the food was impeccable (the menu changes every night, but we got a bluefish pate special to share, tile fish, and pork shoulder - everything PERFECT), and the cocktails strong.  We went for an earlier dinner as much to finally check out their new digs as to reward myself for not smoking for 7 months (happy anniversary to me!), and we could not have picked better. It's a great location for students to walk to after you're done working for the day (as long as you're not dressed too schleppy), to celebrate a special occasion, or just to treat yourself. It's more expensive than your average fair, but I was pleasantly surprised by the damage considering we had 2 cocktails each.",

My husband ordered the New York Strip steak, I ordered the duck confit, and they were both amazing. For dessert, I had the chocolate truffle cake, which is always a great choice. My husband tried the gingerbread, and it was also very tasty. We also both enjoyed an Irish coffee with dessert. I think it was the best one I've ever had.",

We started with the pickle platter (the tempura dilly beans were OUT OF THE PARK) and raclette. For entrees, my sister's ravioli was the surprising winner with it's lighter-than-air cheese filling. My steak was perfectly prepared, though a little too fatty for my taste. Our desserts were lovely, too. Portions were appropriately sized for the cost/value. Truly, though, the service is what made our experience delightful. Our waiter was vibrant, friendly, and catered to my sister's every whim, including pointing out every pink item on the menu. He also didn't bawk (like I would have) when she answered a phone call. I will absolutely return.",

    "text": "The service is decent. With it's drop ceiling, the dining area is somewhat simple, though made interesting by the large wooden tables that still resemble trees. But there's no doubt that the food and cocktails are the shining star at Legume. The menu changes constantly, making it appealing to regulars who are foodies and not in need of having the same thing that they enjoyed on their last visit. The menu is about as small as it gets, usually with about five starters, five entrees, one or two salads and a soup. In addition, they try to source most of the ingredients locally, but also offer up some not-so-common fare. Real foodies are likely to love it, but your less adventurous friends may be a bit turned off. Their cocktails are great. Those who put themselves at the Mercy of the Bartender (literally, that's the menu item) are usually very pleased with what they get (and it's not always the same!). The wines by the glass are a narrow, but interesting field. I've found that whatever starter includes cheese tends to be a winner. The salads are usually quite good. I've found the entrees more likely to be hit or miss. They recently featured vegetarian fare, so I tried the Vegetarian Exposion (with Yellow Corn Grits, Garlic Scapes, Maitake Mushrooms, Roasted Cauliflower, Turnips, Pea Shoots, Salsa Verde and Morita Chile Aioli), which was very good, but not one of the choices that I'd run back for. The adjacent Butterjoint bar is also quite good, and with it's fancy burger menu, will cater to wider palette. Bonus points for the server cheerfully willing to give our large party separate checks. An 18% gratuity was added, but she made it perfectly clear.",

I have had excellent pates and mousses and many other great mains (fish and steak).  The only dishes I have been under impressed by are the soups, which I have generally found bland.

    "text": "So after my 2 stars, everyone was horrified.  How did you not like it?  How did you give them 2 stars?  So, we decided to go to back and give it another try.   We started with 2 drinks - a glass of Riesling which was one of the best glasses of Riesling I have ever had - ever.  I went on a wine tour of the finger lakes a few eyars ago and had almost nothing but rieslings and this was better.  J had the Sunny Day - or something like that with tequila.  Definitely not good.  It was supposed to have a citrus flavor with it, but it really just tasted like a cup of tequila.  Good tequila, but not a god drink.  We started with the lamb riblets.  Amazing!  Excellent lamb flavor and a delicious rhubarb chutney.  I would have preferred more bite with the chutney, but the lamb was really amazing.   I then had the salmon which came with turnips and swiss chard with a red wine reduction and a lemon sauce.  Nothing really blew me out of the water here except the lemon sauce.  It was perfect.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, but what was lacking was the seasoning.  I think everything would have been perked up a bit with a little more seasoning.  J had the lobster ravioli which was the best thing ever!  I really think the ravioli was stuffed with an entire lobster - the sauce, I have no idea what the sauce was, but it was delicious.  This was really, really good. I cannot go on enough about how really fantastic this was.    We also got the tallow fries with mayo.  They were delicious, but probably not worth the heart-clogging calories from using the tallow.  All in all, this was a delicious meal and I am very happy that we went back for a second try.",

    "text": "I'm excited that I finally get to cross Legume off my list. A group of 5 went for a NYE dinner and decided to go all in for the prixe fix menu for four courses. I ordered:  * red oak lettuce, warm mushrooms, pecorino and bistro dressing * gemelli pasta with mushrooms, brown butter,  roasted salsify, sage and pecorino * scallops with salsify puree, bacon, lentils w/ red wine sauce and pea shoots * filmjolk ice cream with candied blood orange  The salad, pasta and main were all hits in my book!! The filmjolk was so-so. The blood orange sauce at the bottom of the ice cream and candid blood orange on top were too bitter for me and did not gel well with the ice cream. However I did take the sugar from the candid blood orange and ate it just with the ice cream which was delicious and added some crunch.  I also got to to try the cara cara, blood orange and red onion salad with maldon salt and olive oil; fresh egg fettuccine with veal bolognese, wild texas antelope; the veal chop special; and the warm gingerbread w/ poached pears and whipped cream. If you are expecting a green salad for the cara cara, blood orange and red onion salad you'll be misled like we all were. It consists of two layers of sliced blood oranges with red onion and dressing on top. The veal chop is a nice sizable piece of meat, and the antelope is already sliced and a manageable portion. The mash potatoes that accompany the veal chop are buttery amazingness!!  I found myself constantly dipping my fork into the skillet for more. These all satisfied my palette too except for the gingerbread dessert. It had a strong flavor of ginger to me, which I do not like, but if you do like ginger you'll enjoy it as my friend did.  The glass of pinot noir was just a-ok. I'm not a huge pinot drinker so could be why.  Service rocked though! We were given a champagne toast on the house and they even accompanied our expecting friend with a sparkling non-alcoholic drink. Also we were given a plate of small bits - one was a cracker with goat cheese a peppered jam, and the other was bread with three pates, both of which were yum!  Legume is a solid 4.5 stars. I'd like to give it 5 but with the desserts and the chosen wine I knocked it just a tad back.",

    "text": "My usual pre-dinner Legume ritual involves pouring over their website and menu to plan my visit.  I noticed they hired a new Chef de Cuisine this month so I had to do some research on just what a Chef de Cuisine does (it's the French version of the English Executive Chef, if that helps). Evidently, they pretty much run the kitchen chefs and plan the menu and ensure proper plating.  Their new Chef came from The Vandal in Lawrenceville, which we never tried.  To add to my trepidation, the menu on their website was two days old.  I was nervous.  I was hoping the food was still as good.  I really had nothing to be afraid of, thankfully.  The food was spectacular as always and the service was delightful. We enjoyed the smoked mackeral pate on crostini with a side dollop of gardiniera made of cauliflower, pepper, onion, and green beans. The fish was a little hidden by the other ingredients but still good and the bread basket they provided in addition to the crostini was incredible.   Our waitress helped us decide on a bottle of wine to complement our meal.  She was knowledgeable and offered personal thoughts on why she would choose one wine over the other.  We loved our wine, by the way.  For entrees, we had the Legume Cassoulet and Lamb Leg Steak ($32 each) with a side of lightly roasted baby carrots in a maple sauce.    I have often heard chefs talking about French Cassoulet and imploring that you must order it if it's on a menu! Cassoulet takes days and 10 or more steps to create and this dish is so warm and comforting and reminiscent of dishes my mom used to make from her German roots involving big heavy cast iron dutch ovens and fatty meats rendered to a tender flavorful spoonful.    This version was served piping hot in its namesake deep earthenware cassole dish. It featured duck confit (which is super tender duck cooked and kept in its rendered fat), pork and garlic sausage (Toulouse Sausage), and pork with bacon and the most incredible crunchy breadcrumb topping with tender tarbais beans (similar to northern beans but really a type of green bean that is ripened to produce these beans). It was so mind-blowingly good with layers of flavor and texture.  Definitely order it if you see it on their menu in the cooler months.  The Lamb Leg Steak came served over a rutabaga potato mash with grilled escarole and a rhubarb chutney that was very tender and flavorful.  The absolutely luscious lamb leg was cut to an inch in thickness with the bone in the middle and drizzled with a slightly tart rhubarb chutney sauce.    We couldn't finish either meal, so they brought us a \"coat check\" number for our leftovers so they could keep them refrigerated for us until we were ready to leave. How cool is that?  I've never heard of that but love it.  For dessert, we shared a slice of the hickory pie with rich fudge sauce and homemade whipped cream that was so delicious, we were tempted to order another one.  Another fantastic meal, Legume!  Well done!",

    "text": "This restaurant is currently surrounded by scaffolding and is slightly hard to find but wow the food was amazing. Very simple, safe menu in my opinion but everything was done right.  Starting with appetizers, we ordered the fries and fried pickles. Both were really good - extra kudos to the fried pickles which were probably the BEST fried pickles I've ever had. The batter is perfect and not soggy at all. The pickle is somehow still juicy without ruining the overall texture - I would HIGHLY recommend.  For entrees, we ordered the steak and pork. Steak - meat was really well cooked and the potatoes and grilled escarole were excellent. No complaints here just a reliable well-executed classic. Pork - meat was also really well cooked. Green beans were a good addition and enjoyable. I was surprised how much I liked the combo of pear with cherries and pear. The pear was SO good. The cherries were soaked in brandy and were difficult for me to eat since they numbed my mouth but for those who like brandy, this is a winner.  Dessert was the Concord grape pie which came with vanilla ice cream. Personally wasn't a huge fan of how sour the pie filling was but it was well complemented by the ice cream and you can tell a lot of attention and time went into this dessert.   Also, ambiance is nice - dim lighting and would recommend for an anniversary or date night if that's what you're looking for. Service was also pretty quick!",

    "text": "I was very disappointed in Legume, a restaurant often mentioned at the top of \"best restaurant\" lists in Pittsburgh. A new chef has taken reign in the kitchen, but Legume's weaknesses go way beyond a change of chefs.   Pittsburgh has issues with restaurant staffing. That was obvious in just our four day visit. The kids hired to commandeer the front have no clue what they're doing, and assign tables with no rhyme or reason. That also happened at Legume, and we switched tables a couple of times.   Legume is not an attractive restaurant. With an ugly suspended ceiling, the cavernous space looks like a banquet room in a Holiday Inn.  Seat cushions had horribly disgusting stains, as pictured.  Nothing has any sense of style. It's bar next door is an infinitely nicer space.  Our server was odd. He emphasized what was missing from the menu, and his suggestions really had no culinary basis. In other words, \"That's a popular choice,\" says nothing about the preparation.  He went missing for inordinate amounts of time, and if it wasn't for Dorian our busser, our dinner may have lasted days. Dorian should be promoted to manager of Legume.  The food tasted less than mediocre. My Raclette, made with cheese from Vermont, was incredibly bland. There's a purpose for a pungent Swiss Cheese usually chosen for a Raclette.  It tastes good!!! The chicken liver mousse was overwhelmed by an accompanying currant jelly - very odd.  Kielbasa is soul food for people from Wisconsin. Legume's version had no soul. It was as if John Denver sang \"RESPECT\" instead of Aretha. No thank you. My trout was salty, bland, and literally tasted more like salmon than trout. Maybe that's because the trout was Scottish and wore a kilt.  Legume was not good, not fun, and a horrific choice for our last night in Pittsburgh. Legume left us a bad memory and a bad taste of Pittsburgh. My bad.",

I went for dinner with my family and we all loved our food.  We started with a beef tartar and French fries(for $5 the French fries are a great starter). I opted for a discounted \"ends\" entree which was described as odd shaped pieces of steak for about half a price. I wouldn't have known they were oddly shaped and it tasted great. My mom and boyfriend got the chicken which would've been my second choice option. The deserts were also very tasty. Though the price is a bit higher than your normal dine out meal, it matches the quality of food. The prices were on par for any steakhouse.   I would definitely return for a nice meal out or special occasion.",

Too expensive for everyday occasions, but perfect for a romantic or special occasion. The portions of meat on their entrees are generous, but if you want a full serving of vegetables with your meal, you will have to order a side. Still not sure why I continue to order glasses of wine at restaurants like this, because the pours are never as generous as one expects for double digits. Service was fine, and the ambience was low-key and softly lit.",

The lamb leg steak and the sausage duo were lovely (but a bit heavy).  The only failure we could find was the chef-made ice cream of the day: apple piece flavor. It was a bit gross.

It was the they found the reservation and we were seated.  The menu was interesting with seasonal fare, but made sharing a bit difficult. The waitress was kind enough to inform us there was only two pieces of halibut left and if we want them, she'll reserve it. I took her up on that option. We order drinks and appetizers and we're set. The soup I got was an asparagus cold soup, perfect for the hot summer weather. It's creamy and good, a little heavy but doable. The entrees arrive and the halibut was cooked well, with a slight crispy crunch. As for the side of grits, I'm appalled to say it was grits. I grew up in the south and that was not creamy. It was a very strange interpretation.  The wait staff were all pleasant and vibe very quiet and scholarly. Not sure it suites what I was hoping for. The food is good, but not wowing me by any stretch.",

Service: The first and biggest issue is the service. The hostess was largely devoid of a personality but then we literally had to ask for a server after 20 mins of sitting there with just water. Meanwhile the place is not that busy and there was plenty of servers. After observing an awkward conversation with the gentleman we flagged down and a few of the servers, one of them waited on us. Legume has to focus on improving service asap.  Food: The beet app my wife and I shared was pretty good but the salads were mediocre and no where near what would be expected given the $10 price tag. They were featuring lobster when we were there so we got the lobster ravioli. Ravioli itself was good with chunks of meat but it had some overly salted brown sauce that seemed to overpower the lobster and was not a great compliment.  Bottom line is if I'm dropping north of $150 on a meal, it's got to be a much better experience than I got at Legume.",

    "text": "** Definitely come at least once to the cheap date night with your significant other for the experience. Three course meal with smaller portions but good atmosphere and gives you a taste of finer dining without breaking the bank.  Most of this review is for the experience of fine dining with three courses in a more boujee environment, more than the food which was good but not exceptional (except for maybe the first course).  Cheap date night - occurs every first Wednesday of the month and is $50 per couple for a three course meal for two. Includes bread as an appetizer. Was definitely intimidated at first by the idea since I don't do fine dining often... Was I going to be the only person in basketball shorts while everyone was in suits? Or would it be the other way around? Ended up being a chill atmosphere with no dress code - just try to clean up a bit and you'll be fine. Definitely don't need to overdress. The ambiance is great for dates, and a good place to hold conversation while feeling relaxed, which is why I say go for the experience if anything.   First course: Pumpkin Muscle Soup. Easily my favorite course of the three. Very unique pumpkin taste that was flavorful but not overwhelming, and got my tastes buds flowing for sure. Muscles in the soup sealed the deal, and the presentation was on point. Would definitely pay to get it in a bigger bowl if that was an option.  Second course: Bluefish with rice, green beans, and pickled relish. A bit smaller than I would have liked, but I understand that fine dining is classy and not about stuffing yourself. Fish was nice and tender, just wished there were more greens on the side to go with it. Presentation was nice as well.   Third course: Pavlova with lemon cream / chocolate truffle cake. You know they goofed on the dessert when my girl wanted to go to the gas station afterwards to pick up ice cream. I had a taste of both desserts since we ordered the two different options. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed in both. The pavlova was extremely hard to eat since the texture was so difficult to work with, and seemed to have too much cream. Hard to eat without having the whole thing collapse on you. Chocolate truffle cake just had something about it that was odd.. can't quite put my finger around it but it didn't seem sweet enough. The cream didn't go quite well with the cake. Id have been perfectly happy with something simple like a scoop of vanilla ice cream but this time the desserts felt a bit too extra.",

After all the great write-up's, I was so excited to get reservations at Legume.   The very basic service expectations were not met, much less any elevated hopes for a 'fine-dining' experience. Our meals were delivered in 'phases' because our food was accidentally delivered to the wrong table. Half the group had finished before the other half even started! We asked for vegetable sides that never came. When we asked, waited said 'oh, we don't have that'. Then, why was it on the menu? And why did you take our order for it?  The website reads 'please notify us of special request and we will accommodate'. . . Wrong. I indicated there were two vegans and called later to inform of allergies. Not only was the waiter not able to help us navigate the menu - they made zero mention of it. We had to remind him and ask and confirm. . .   The 'front-house manager' apologized and credited us $80. Please, do not insult us and assume that made up for it. We came thousands of miles for a one night celebration. Legume was a huge disappointment.",

We made early reservations around 5:30p so we had the place to ourselves basically. The menu changes everyday so some of the things we read on Yelp that we wanted to try weren't on that day's menu - which is fine!   Ordered the pork appetizer. It came out on a pretty big plate which threw me off because it made the portion size look awfully small. It was tasty even though the bread was REALLY tough to chew.. but I think french bread is like that? No idea.  For entrees we ordered the fish (the other one that's not red fish) and duck confit. Both were surprisingly filling and the flavors were all there, rich and colorful.   We ordered a cocktail to share and I thought the mini umbrella they added was overly done and didn't pair well with the vibes or cuisine.   Also, threw me off A LOT when the hostess wanted to seat us by the window next to a big sidewalk construction site with tarp, cones, and pipes. Not the aesthetic and view I was going for at a nice dinner.   Overall, this restaurant is good but a one time thing for me.",

I have never sent anything back, the chef knows how to season and bring out the flavors. You will never get overcooked fish or a salad with too much dressing.  Just good food made great. You can have a conversation at this restaurant without being constantly interrupted, but you will never be left wondering when your food will arrive.  Yes it is that good.  Servers are new but good. Some of the previous were more schooled but I have no real complaints. Love the food, love that you can talk, and leave the place feeling good but not stuffed.",

Let's just say the dog will be eating better than me tonight because I've had better steak at the outback. For a restaurant called Legume, I expected more vegetarian dishes but the vegetarian dish was the worst. Charred Tempe = vomit. Wine was ridiculously overpriced but it was the best part of the meal. The restaurant itself needs some work, when you pay $75 for dinner, dollar store paper lanterns should not be hanging over your head. I was mislead by the yelp reviews about this place, definitely two thumbs down.",

    "text": "My brother, who's from out of town, declared this his favorite meal in Pittsburgh in the numerous visits he's made to see me. I've lived here for two, going on three years and I have to agree.   We knew legume was small and popular, but decided to try our luck at walking in without a reservation on a Saturday around 5:30. The manager was very apologetic when he said they were all booked. We exited and were walking down the street, trying to figure out a Plan B, when we heard someone rushing up behind us--the manager. Apparently someone had just called to cancel a reservation, so we could have their table.   Running down half a block to catch us? That's dedication and great customer service. (But don't risk it like we did--make a reservation!)  And the food? Usually I have a favorite dish or two of a meal--but I liked every single part of our meal and just can't narrow it down. We started with the crostini with goat cheese and pepper jelly. The pepper jelly was both sweet and spicy, and a nice contrast to the tangy goat cheese. Next, we had a wheat berry salad with grapefruit and feta--delicious. While my entree, the mushroom ravioli, doesn't sound all that exotic, it was perfectly executed--the pasta dough was fresh and cooked just right, and the parmesan cream sauce was spot-on. (Brother was very happy with the flounder.) We finished off our dinner with the chocolate truffle cake and the caramel rice pudding--both were good, though here I guess I can point to a favorite and say that I preferred the chocolate truffle cake--not too rich, but just the right amount of chocolate goodness.  Yes, legume is on the pricey side, especially according to Pittsburgh standards. The portions are also small by Pittsburgh standards. We didn't leave feeling stuffed, but perfectly satisfied. One of the hostesses was very friendly as we were leaving, and apologized for turning us away initially and then chasing us down--but I let her know that we were really grateful for what they did. I have no regrets about legume, except that I didn't try it earlier!",

The staff is very causal both in dress and speech, which I much prefer. They were clearly knowledgable and well-trained. When good food is prepared and served by skilled people, there is no need for stuffiness. We had the raclette and bluefish pate to start, both were delicious and perfectly balanced. My husband had the sweet potato ravioli and I had the grilled escarole salad. Beautiful on both accounts. For dessert we had the gingerbread with poached pear. It was bursting with flavor and my tongue was tingling just the right amount! Really lovely meal, served by lovely people, in a lovely space. Go!",

    "text": "Remember how Green Day was the punk band for turds? Legume is the Green Day of fine dining. The restaurant looks like a set on Portlandia. The decor is very dark, curtains, looks kinda like a mix between an old Slovakia grandmother's home and a funeral home. It is clean and seating is private, very spacious. The wait staff dress hipster and are very pretentious. Nice wine menu. The menu is farm to table, very few selections. Kinda overpriced for what you get.   First course: Only hot salads (grilled greens), which was actually not that bad, I think more is less sometimes...too much stuff in the salad, including pickled cauliflower. eh..not a fan. Overall salad not bad but 11$ for a tiny salad is high even in a nice place.  Entre: The menu was very limited, If you like trying really different dished this place does have that. They had monk fish...just don't go in expecting any familiar items. I had the pan chicken, not gonna lie, it was terrible. It was SO bland, it reminded me of Banquet TV dinner chick. I think they are going for \"pure\" food, but a little season or herb wouldn't kill it. It was just chicken, maybe they used a pinch of pepper, but so boring and bland. It came with potatoes and greens, very small portions, they were not bad. My boyfriend had kielbasa, which was no better than Oscar Myer, just so bland. The pierogies were ...you guess it, bland. Just a plan pierogie with nothing on it. The dishes were presented nice, great service. This place might be nice for some people, but the food is very bland, a limited menu, and its just corny...if you follow my reviews you see I like good food \"casual elegance\" I call it, great upscale food with a laid back trendy environment. This place is far from it...",

The chirozo was very, very mild, but flavorful.  My husband's pork chop was juicy and tender and complimented by a rich, decadent polenta.    The server was low-key, genial, knowledgeable and helpful.  He offered his opinions on different dinner options-- and was spot on. I wish every restaurant had staff as competent.  The hostesses were professional and pleasant as well.  Don't expect to find the same things on the menu as are described in these reviews.  The menu changes daily.  How much fun is that?!  With a chef this talented, I have no doubt that all his creations, no matter what they may be in a given day, will be delicious.  The food  would get a 5 out of 5, as would the service.  The ambiance is another story.  The place is huge, cheaply decorated (what's with the UPC codes on the art?)  and very brightly lit.  The space was the opposite of intimate-- which really didn't match with its other outstanding aspects.  Dim the lights, add some candles, make it a little less like an off-white cavern, and you have a fabulous restaurant from start to finish.",

Their menu changes daily, though it looks like some of the dishes carry over from one day to the next.  I started with a charcuterie plate with several kinds of pate and steak tartare that was the highlight of my meal.  I think it was meant to be shared amongst several people but I ended up eating the whole thing myself...  My main course was lamb kielbasa, which was also very good.  Nicely seasoned sausage with some kale and polenta as accompaniment.  The only reason I gave this restaurant 4/5 stars was the wine list.  The list is smaller and trying to be eclectic, but just comes off to me as lacking in options and value.  A lot of their menu could be easily paired with a Pinot Noir, and the only Oregon selection on the list was Four Graces, which doesn't crack my top 20 of Oregon pinot producers.  I wish they had a bit more variety in the wine department, but otherwise, an excellent restaurant.",

We were so impressed that on our return to Pittsburgh this January, we returned to Legume.  We have to say it is one of the best restaurants around...anywhere. Their cocktails were perfect.  The cocktail I enjoyed last summer wasn't on the menu so the waitress suggested one which was excellent. The pickle plate is a must-have for those who love pickled anything. Their beef and kimchi soup was perfectly seasoned.  The fries from Butterjoint (attached bar) were just delicious. We love crispy fries and their fries are far from crispy, but they were just yummy.  We had 3 different entrees at the table.  All were fantastic.  We closed our perfect meal with the heavenly cardamom pot de creme for dessert.  Happiness!!",

    "text": "Legume had been an oft awaited destination for my girlfriend and myself. We were savoring the moment where we would walk into the doors and lose ourselves in culinary decadence. It was to be saved for the right occasion with lustful anticipation.  Fast forward to her birthday and we had the right opportunity, the moment had arrived!  We were seated immediately and greeted by our waiter in a timely fashion. To start, we looked over the drink menu for an apertif. They all sounded interesting and delicious, and I settled on a concoction that mixed a dry gin and Laphroig, a smoky scotch in a martini. The drink was perfectly clear, surprising me, given that Laphroig has a carmel hue to it. Both flavored mixed impeccably and I sipped at this for the remainder of the meal. For drinks, they get an A+.  Though the menu was succinct, the choices all looked marvelous. To start, we ordered the Pattte for an appetizer. It was quite good, and came with the most delicious mustard with the whole seeds in it.   Our main dishes were split between lamb for her, and veal for myself. Legume essentially reminded me of Salt at this point, as both dishes were cooked perfectly, but lacked that distinctive coup de gras in flavor pairings. The mushroom flavor was very subtle in the sauce that paired with my veal.   The dessert however, was nothing short of spectacular and I am not a dessert person. We ordered the carrot cake, and we were both floored by the perfection.  I will certainly go back to Legume and Butterjoint, though I give it 4 stars for falling  a bit short on our main courses.",

We dine out a lot in Pittsburgh and elsewhere I can count a (believe it or not) spectacular salad and 'best steak ever' as typical experiences at Legume that we had come to expect. That is until recently.  Legume seems to have lost its way- the bartender was inexcusably a complete ass and really turned off my dining partner,  he was plain rude and in the end he overcharged us.  The dinner service was average at best. The menu had our wine listed as a 2013 but the bottle we received was a 2014- without explanation- really? The food was very good. They brought us the wrong dessert (but 2 out of 3 were correct) and they all were good  Sad to say that Legume is losing its way- it will be a while before we go back.",

We were greeted by our server (Sara) and she was outstanding! Drinks- I went with the \"Mercy of the bartender\" which is allowing the bartender to pick and make what cocktail you have. Also had some sparkling Rose to toast a birthday we were celebrating. The wifey doesnt drink and they were thoughtful enough (without request mind you) to make her a sparkling non-alcoholic drink to join in all the cheersing.  We started with a few appetizers including the bluefish pate and the pork pate, the latter being one of my fav dishes of the night.  Legume changes their menu daily. On this occasion I ordered the house made lamb kielbasa with golden rice and peeres and onions. This sauage was fantastic and the little grains of rice we amazing!  We all shared all of the deserts on the menu but the one that stands out to me is the pamplova (sp?) with strawberry jam. This wa a huge meringue with fresh strawberry jam and berry compote. The meringue was soft on the inside and beautiful.  Highly recomended if in the PGH.",

    "text": "After eating here only once, Legume is now in the top of my favorite Pittsburgh restaurants list.  Consistent with what's already been said, this place is amazing! We tried several of their pates, each with a distinctive flavor-some smokey, some  savory-all delicious.  We next tried the grilled escarole salad- one of the best things I've ever eaten- the combo between the bitter escarole, salty parmesan, sweet cherry tomato, and crispy bacon was heavenly.  I had the sausage with polenta and escarole (you can tell, I love escarole).  The home made sausage was delicious, but the star of the plate, for me at least, was the polenta.  Creamy and caramelized on the outside, this was perhaps the best polenta I've ever had.  We finished wth the pear tart, which was also good, but I would leave more room for the savory dishes!  Their cocktails are fabulous, I've heard, but we stuck with wine to pair with dinner-  their wine list was phenomenal, and clearly chosen to pair well with the food for the day.   As their menu changes daily, I know I'll be back very soon...",

    "text": "I've been to Legume three times. Each time, the atmosphere and the service has been great, but I left disappointed with the food. I came back multiple times because their menu changes frequently, and I figured that perhaps I just picked the wrong items off the menu. In the end, my opinion is that the food is incredibly overpriced for the quality - this is the main reason for my low rating. I don't think that Legume stands up to the other restaurants (in the Pittsburgh area) at this price range.  The first two times I went were a year or so ago, so I do not remember all the details. But I tried the tasting menu once - for the appetizer, we received a plate of pickled vegetables. I was very disappointed because 1) salt intake overload 2) the pickled veggies didn't have much variety in taste and 3) I was hoping for a more savory appetizer. I think the rest of the tasting menu could have been good, but I was so salt overloaded from the appetizer that my tongue was numb.  Tonight my friend and I tried the smoked bluefin pate, their lamb entree, the swordfish entree, chocolate truffle cake, and vanilla icecream with peaches and almond biscotti.   The bluefin pate had a nice smokey flavor and I enjoyed it. My friend did not enjoy the lamb dish because it was too heavy and tough. To be fair, our waiter had warned us about it, explaining that the dish was not a rack of lamp chops, and that the meat could be a bit \"chewy.\"  My friend had asked for a medium rare, but it was unevenly cooked medium to medium-well.The sauce had a nice spicy kick to it, but they could have cut down on the sugar. My swordfish was a bit overcooked (I understand this is a hard fish to cook, and is tougher in texture than other fishes). The sauce was too thick, too sweet, and too salty.I noticed that my swordfish and my friend's lamb was accompanied by the same rice and turnips - I did not appreciate that the two entrees were not unique (at the $30/dish range).  I quite enjoyed my chocolate truffle cake - it was rich and chocolaty and melted in my mouth - and I didn't try my friend's vanilla icecream and peaches with biscotti dessert, but he was unhappy with it and said the peaches were reminiscent of cough syrup.  My overall impression is that many of the dishes at Legume are heavy and salty. While I enjoyed parts of my meal, they were not worth the hefty bill at the end. There are places with better food for the same price or cheaper. I'll only be returning here if an item on their changing menu catches my attention.",

    "text": "I've been once, and was blown away; it was one of my best restaurant meals in Pittsburgh, having lived here 15 years.  The first course (beans with a wonderful vinaigrette) was excellent, the main course (scallops) was excellent, and the dessert (chocolate cake) was excellent.  I can't think of many other Pittsburgh restaurants where each dish made me think \"wow!\" with each bite.  (Hyeholde comes to mind).  Two deficiencies: it's often crowded and when it is, it's loud.  I got there at 8pm on a Tuesday evening, and there was a 15 min. wait (a reflection of its popularity).  The repeat business it seems to draw within the local neighborhood reminds me of Point Brugge Cafe.  I think Legume should do something to soften its acoustics.  If you're looking for a romantic evening with private conversation, this may not be the place, because the tables are quite close together.  But the food is excellent.  Portions are a good size, i.e. smaller than Pittsburgh norms.  Prices are a little high (maybe $45 per person).  They don't have alcohol; they're BYOB.  Reservations for parties of 6 or more, only.  Their menu is a little heavy on the meat, for my taste.  I would have appreciated more vegetarian options.",

I can't say that I've had anything there that was short of amazing.    The first time I went to Legume, I was a little nervous since places like this (with the rotating menu and \"innovative\" cuisine kind of attitude) can sometimes be gimmicky and overpriced.  Not at all the case for Legume.  Their food is straightforward and delicious, always highlighting the essence of the ingredients used.  The combinations are always perfect.   The waiters are friendly and knowledgeable and the location is cozy and nice.  My only complaint (and I think this is mostly since this is new for Legume since their old location was BYOB) is that the wine list is a little limited.  Considering how committed Legume is to continuous improvement, I have a feeling that this will be remedied in time.   Bottom line:  Fantastic restaurant, worth every penny :)",

A truly talented chef can make a few vegetarian options actually taste really good and stay True to his or her name. I had the polenta for dinner, which was the ONLY vegetarian entree on the menu. It was very heavily salted-- hard to eat. The French fries were also extremely heavily salted. If you have heart failure, kidney disease or hypertension, be careful. If they had more vegetarian options and cut down on the salt, I would give them 4 out of 5 stars.",

When we didn't like our table, the hostess was more than happy to seat us at another table.    Our server Jason, was incredible.  He was extremely helpful with the menu and even helped me select my beverage.  I got a Boyd and Blue.  And for you sweet drink lovers, I highly recommend it.  It's Boyd & Blair Vodka, blueberry aigre-doux, Cardamaro and ginger.  It was so good, I had more than one.    For starters, we shared the red oak lettuces with sauteed mushrooms and pecorino.  We loved it.  For a shared dish, we got the spicy bok choy.  I like spicy and this was very spicey.  For our meals, it was a difficult decision.  BJ got the ravioli with veal.  He liked it okay, but said it was nothing to rave about.  I got the barley-musroom risotto with Pirate Blue cheese.  It was excellent.  For dessert we shared that gingerbread with pears and whipped cream.  It was a perfect ending to our meal.  One thing I would like better about this restaurant is if they would post the evening's menu earlier in the day.  That way it would be easier to plan a visit to be able to take advantage of choices more to your personal liking.  All in all, we enjoyed Legume and will visit again.",

    "text": "I have heard so many good things about this restaurant at its new Oakland location. We had been to Regent Square and we were looking forward to the new improved and larger restaurant. The food was good- very good, but for the price point, I was somehow disappointed-(we paid $100 for two, getting only 2entrees , 2 wines by the glass, no apps, no salads, no soups, no sides or desserts or coffee).  The entrees- I got the swordfish, which was excellent, with a wonderful savory sauce.  The look of the serving dish was weird- a bowl with a blue rim that looked like a soup bowl that came from a cafeteria. The gentleman sitting 12 inches away had the same swordfish served in a slightly larger, more  elegant white dish. I didn't think this was a good sign, but it did remind me of the old Regent Square style of dishes. My husband got the steak and liked it but wished it was warmer, or the plate hotter. This was probably the biggest infraction of all. Perhaps we should have said something about it at the time, but the opportunity did not arise.  The atmosphere and decor are lovely. Elegant lighting, iron decorative sconces, carved tables, and multiple rooms. This place has a European feel, and a huge improvement over the tiny digs of the RS version. The noise was not a factor but there were distractions. Maybe it was the location of our table ( close proximity to kitchen door and Bar entrance) and the way I felt squeezed in with all the senior citizens and possibly because it was my 56th birthday, I am now relegated to the not cool section of the trendy restaurants. We had made a reservation and the restaurant was not particularly crowded. What a difference a patron's experience can be with a different set of circumstances! I really was looking forward to the experience but I can't say for sure when I will return.",

    "text": "A calm lunch experience that started with an extremely gracious host and continued with my low-key server, both accommodating my every whim. Rustic neutral vibe in the decor, bright wood and yellow paint, large windows for natural daylight. Legume feels equal parts waking up from a warm summer mid-afternoon nap and enjoying a gust of wind on the deck of a sailboat. RE-LAXING. In fact, the whole meal glided effortlessly, my small-plates arriving only 8 minutes after ordering.  Crunch! Great bread's offset by fridge-temp butter. Stole a glance of my neighbor's food. Crunch! \"Those hard boiled eggs are perfect mustard yellow middle, no green ring.\" Went instead with...  Goat cheese pepper crostini - buttery crostini's well-toasted, jelly a shade sweet and in need of more bite. Healthy dab of goat cheese at room temp  Pork duck pistachio pate - soft profile with only moderate salt and no old/gamey note, just freshness. Spicy grain mustard provides plenty the bite the crostini's needed, and the quality pork adds some good salt and character.  Tallow fries - ridiculouslt cheap for this much food. The aioli needs more character and spice and has too slushy/goopy of a texture bordering on congealing gravy. but the fries themselves maintain a nice crispness given the shoe string thinness.. let's call it 85% crispy.  Nothing exceptional but all very pleasing. Definitely one of the most consistent near UPitt and CMU",

We had one waiter serving a large area, and he was pretty slow. It took 20min to get wine. A tiny basket of bread came 35min past. We realized the process will take hours but decided to go with the flow and ordered appetizers, which we got after 15 more minutes. The appetizers were great, especially the asparagus soup. We finished the appetizers in 5 min. It took 30 more minutes to get a tiny portion of Damon and a pretty tough stake.  This is an overpriced place which in reality is nothing but average. Don't waste your $$$",

    "text": "I tried this restaurant for the first time recently with two co-workers. We actually were trying to go to a restaurant right down the street that evening but ended up at Legume because the other restaurant was closed.  The interior was a bit odd.... When I mentioned it to my friend, she actually said that someone had told her a rumor that the restaurant had at one time been a funeral parlor. If True, it's an odd combination of interesting, strange, and a little gross.  I enjoyed the simplicity of the menu. Even though I was there in September, I just looked up the menu online, and the majority of it has changed since then. I personally think that's interesting, but of course, the downfall of that is being unable to reorder favorite items if they are quickly taken off the menu....  I ordered a vegetarian ravioli (I forget the exact ingredients) for my meal and tried my friend's Tallow Fries with Mayonnaise. The ravioli was delicious and the portion was a nice size, but I did feel that it was a little overpriced. I believe it was about $18 but would have personally priced it in the $12-15 range. The fries were incredible, and in my opinion, very worth the $5 price.  Overall, I enjoyed my experience and wouldn't mind going back. However, it's not a place that I'll be rushing back to try again.",

The Grilled Escarole Salad with Pickled Turnips, Parmesan, White Anchovy, Mustard Vinaigrette and a Crispy Poached Egg - the fanciest, yummiest salad I've had in a long, long time. And, wait for it, the cassoulet. Oh, the cassoulet. The Legume cassoulet, not available year-round but, again worth the wait, is perfection. It is a slow-simmered masterpiece. It is simple but rich. It is crusty on top and warm and creamy down below. Every single bite is the right balance of meat and bean and veggie. The mouth feel of the dish is worth it alone. I would eat mountains of Legume's cassoulet. If you only need one reason to go to Legume, it's the cassoulet.",

By the bathrooms and the kitchen and the walk way from the kitchen to the bar.  Yes, it was on me to bring it to their attention to move us. But, since I have been here I have noticed my pro active Chicago attitude puts people off.  Anyway, the restaurant remained empty after we went through the vegetarian tasting for two and the great desert.   But we sat there with the noise and this empty restaurant and thought, what the f***.  Everyone was very nice, I guess, but that whole first impression you guys put on us?

    "text": "We had a great dinner at Legume last evening. This was a very pleasant evening in North Oakland with just a hint of rain in the air with the pre-summer weather being some the best in recent years. One thing for everyone to be cognizant about is, Legume does has Valet parking across the street which is vital in this part of Oakland.  The hostess greeted us with a great smile and we were seated immediately at our reservation time and given a four top for a party of two because all the others were occupied. Some restaurants will not do this and make you wait. Legume was very generous and hospitable in this aspect.   The menu here changes frequently, actually daily, so you can come and enjoy the revelations when you arrive or visit the menu online which they post each day after 5 P.M.  For our meal we started with a sharing plate of Goot Essa Blue Cheese with Oat Biscuits, Honey, Candied Walnuts and Apples. This was an excellent Blue and the Oat Biscuits were delicious and unique. We finished every morsel and were happy to be left want for more, since we had two more courses to come.  The service at this point was very good: water glasses filled; drinks promptly arrived; silverware efficiently exchanged. Speaking of drinks, we had the house cocktail 'full stop' which was expertly made at the Butterjoint, which is Legumes connected lounge. You will love this drink if you as we like Boyd & Blair vodka; green Chartreuse; St. Germaine; and lemon.  Next course we had a house salad Mixed Greens with Bistro Vinaigrette, Radish and Croutons which was just so light and delicious. The radish was sliced so thin as to be light as the greens and the croutons were also so thin, light and crunchy and matched perfectly.  Also we enjoyed today's soup which was Chilled Asparagus Soup with Buttermilk Panna Cotta, Preserved Lemon and Dill. This soup was remarkable, unique, outstanding and delicious enough to rave about it.   Service, again remains outstanding at this point with team service, refilling water, clearing and replacing utensils and always unobtrusive but very attentive.  Training here is obviously a key part of the business.  For my companion we asked for a wine recommendation to match her next course. Our server was extremely informed and trained on the wine list and recommend two that would match. One of her recommendations I had also considered as appropriate so we chose that one. There are somewhere around eighteen wines by the glass all well chosen to have a high likelihood of matching anything you may be having for dinner. The list is quite international with sparkling, whites and reds from around the world.  So what did we choose, well the Villa Pillo, Sangiovese/Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot from Tuscany which was perfectly delicious.  For our entre course I chose the Salmon and Linda decided to have an appetizer size and whet with the Chicken Livers. I will explain each preparation a little more so it may make your mouth water like it did ours. Linda's was Chicken Livers with Polenta Croutons, Bacon, Pickled Cherries and Spring Onion   Linda just kept saying,, oh this is good; oh this is delicious; oh this is wonderful between complementing this dish with a sip of the great Tuscan wine to go with it. Tender, altogether delicious, unique, and great culinary talent from the kitchen best describes this dish in the fewest words.  Mine was the Wild King Salmon with Crispy Potatoes, Asparagus, Nettle Salsa Verde and Spruce Tip Hollandaise. With salmon, I can only eat it 'wild and king'. King is called king for good reason. The salmon was cooked a nice medium rare that maintained its soft unctuous wild salmon flavor with skin so crispy that it crunched and melted in our mouth. All the ingredients on the plate were a great complement to the salmon and to each other. This dish was very well matched and beautifully plated. The asparagus was favorable and tender. The hollandaise was light and a perfect example of how it should be made. This sauce performed its role well by being just perfect on its own, deliciously complementing the other components without taking over, and being very memorable. The crispy potatoes were small pieces that were light with a nice crisp on the outside with a tender wonderful potato flavor on the inside.    That was pretty much one outstanding meal, prepared and plated perfectly with numerous excellent service interactions and darn, no room for dessert.",

    "text": "I've been here twice so far, and both times I left incredibly satisfied. The first time was in the summer, the second in the winter so each time the menu was completely different to reflect what was in season.   Both times, we had really great service. I usually like to ask my server what they recommend, and their staff seems very knowledgeable about what their chefs are serving. The same goes for cocktails! The second time I went, I had the Bartender's Choice or whatever, where you basically pick a liquor and leave it up to the bartender.   They are great at letting their fresh ingredients shine. When I went in the summer, one of the best parts of my meal was just my side of carrots and some other vegetables. In the winter, I had an incredible blood orange salad. That's not to say that the entrees are great. I am usually not too adventurous with meat- I mostly stick to chicken or fish at restaurants- but I decided to try their lamb. I'm so glad I did- it was fall-apart tender and very flavorful (if not a bit salty.) Finally, their desserts are wonderful as well. I've gotten their pavlova both times, with different fruit toppings depending on the time of year. In the summer, my husband got some homemade ice cream that had chunks of their leftover cherry pie from the night before- to die for!   I will definitely come back here- although with the price point, I'll keep it to a special occasion.",

I chose the goat chop for my meal and was super excited.  I love goat and it isn't often you can get it.  It was recommended to order it Medium Rare and I did.  It arrived and the end pieces were indeed Medium Rare, every other bite, rare.  The 9 oz chop was also mostly bone and difficult to eat.  I got, maybe, 6 bites off of the entire thing.  Super disappointing.  We ordered the Pavlova for dessert, which was light and delicious.  Overall, not the best meal I have ever had.  The menu that night had several fish options, a steak and the goat chop.  I wish there would have been a chicken, duck or poultry option.  I'm not sure if I would go back or not.  The cost of the meal was certainly not a selling point....",

The last time was on my birthday, when my wife set up a very nice dinner for two and we had the Chef's Tasting with the wine pairing. Like others who have reviewed Legume, we found our service to be excellent, and enjoyed the presentation of each course.  The food here is absolutely flavorful and delicious. It's the kind of place that can almost make you consider licking your plate when nobody's watching you. (Not that I did that, but I wanted to... luckily there was bread to help me take full advantage of the sauces...) Every item was perfectly cooked and delicious - from our fish course, through the lamb carpaccio, to the dessert finale, all of the proteins and garnishes were complimentary to each other and well prepared.  The only minor \"flaw\" was that they feel the need to maximize their space by putting a table for two right next to the doors to the kitchen - now, Legume is not the concept restaurant where you sit in full view of the kitchen, so this seems like a little bit of an afterthought. The problem for us was that in an otherwise quiet, slightly dark and romantic space, we were seated in a bright and somewhat loud section. I would have rather waited for another table in the main part of the restaurant; it would have paired better with the overall culinary experience. That being said, the food was so good here that I am not docking any stars for this...  Will definitely return.",

For what they're charging and the food they're serving, it seems like - generically - they might be better served by a slightly larger location.  Plates are small, entree portions are good, portions of sides are about half of what I'd normally expect; I really like sides more than entrees, so I was put off by the tiny plates of sides.  Would probably spend more and order an additional side on my next trip in.  I like *eating* food, not just looking at it.  Only thing that really knocked it off of five stars was our waiter; he seemed condescending to both of us, although we didn't mention that to each other until it came up in conversation the next day.

After seeing all of the positive reviews on here I decided to call Legume for a reservation. It was a large group of 13 people and we reserved a private room for the night. This involved filling out a little bit of paperwork and giving credit card information. I made the reservation about 1 month in advance to be safe due to high demand that weekend. Our dinner was absolutely delicious, and the wait staff professional, attentive, kind and knowledgeable about both drinks and the current menu. The menu at Legume changes all the time to keep up with what is in season and fresh. All night my entire family was raving about how delicious their meals and drinks were. Extremely satisfied with my experience and so glad I chose Legume for my special occasion, it was definitely worth the high price tag. Thank you Legume for making my graduation dinner so special!",

Their menu changes daily depending on ingredients the chef can get his hands on.  The chef is from Maine originally and thus is a stickler to high quality seafood; the restaurant actually gets all their seafood shipped directly from the suppliers instead of through distributers.  I've tried their duck confit and pate as appetizers.  I was originally surprised to see duck confit listed, as it's not a dish I have run across in Pittsburgh ever (if you know where I can get it, let me know!).  Both appetizers are definitely worth having again.  I've tried their lamb chops; perfectly seasoned and cooked to medium rare.  Their cassoulet is rich and hearty and perfect for the cold winter months.  The proteins they use are sausage, pork, and duck confit along with the beans of course.  The flavors were rich, but it was a tad too salty for me, and my palate already prefers the food I eat to be heavily seasoned.  They do take reservations now, so that's always a good thing.  They're also BYOB ($4 corkage).  And every now and then they have special events for special occasions, so definitely be on the lookout for those as well.",

Warm, crusty bread to start followed by excellent cream of mushroom soup.   The next dish was goat cheese crostini with hot pepper jelly.  Not my favorite, but the goat cheese was great.  Main course was crispy faro with ricotta cheese, corn, mushrooms, and tomato pesto.  It was perfectly prepared and sized.  $4 corkage fee was reasonable.  The desserts sounded great but I was stuffed.   Love the close, bustling atmosphere.  Servers were attentive but not annoying. Looking forward to trying the rest of the vegetarian menu.  Pros: Fresh, local ingredients, great service, great atmosphere. Cons: My dining partner felt it was a little pricey for the serving sizes, but I was satisfied.    I highly suggest making a reservation. At 8PM on a Wednesday, the small restaurant was full.",

All of my expectations were met. I have heard other vegetarians complain that the veggie options here are not abundant, but to be honest, they never are at upscale restaurants. The important thing to me is to have a couple of options that are simply really good. And Legume delivered. I had the \"winter vegetarian explosion\" dish- and while the actual items weren't incredibly sophisticated (quiche, mushroom soup, chickpea salad, and a baguette), they were all perfectly flavored. And I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful they actually were. The best item for me by far was the grilled radicchio, which was absolutely amazing. I enjoyed every single bite of the meal, as well as the incredible beer list for lunch. And every person in our group had nothing bad to say about any of their dishes.

The halibut sat on a bed of dandelion leaves and rice, and fell apart easily.  I would describe it as the best fish dish I've tasted so far in Pittsburgh.  I had order the steak medium rare.  It was crispy at the first layer, and chewy on the inside.  Although the steak was good, I liked the risotto that came with it better.  My bf also got a lemonade that he enjoyed immensely.

I have A LOT of food allergies and restrictions. More than 15, many of which are common ingredients. It's hard for me to go out to eat, but not impossible. There are many restaurants in town that I am able to eat at. I have been in Pittsburgh for 2 years and as long as I have been here people have told me that I should go to Legume because they are so accommodating to people with allergies. I finally went a few weeks back for a friend's birthday. I called ahead like I often do to ensure that I would be able to eat there. The woman I spoke with on the phone was pleasant so I had high expectations.  My experience was so very disappointing. The server was rude, insulting, and condescending. I understand that I am require more accommodation than most, but I'm not sure I have ever had a server make me feel so small. As if I was an inconvenience and a hassle to him as opposed to a paying customer. I was a server for years and I would never have dreamed of being so rude to my customers. I wanted to help make their experience exactly what they were looking for. The server at Legume was so unhelpful and flat-out insulting about my special restrictions that when it came time to order I chose not to eat anything rather than spend $30 on a meal I was unsatisfied with just to placate him. Going out to eat at a new place with my allergies is an uncomfortable and apprehensive experience for me. I find it embarrassing for me to not eat while others are eating and often awkward for the people I am with. I would not choose that option lightly. I call ahead specifically to know whether I need to stay home instead of chancing that I will sit there staring at the table while the rest of the party is eating. But I will not eat or pay for something I'm not interested in just because I have restrictions and a server refuses to be helpful and is barely civil in his interaction with me. I shouldn't be punished for having allergies. But punishment perfectly describes my experience at Legume  Because I didn't order, the server ignored me the rest of the night. He did not refill my water glass, even when he filled others at the table (luckily there are other staff who help to refill water). I might have ordered a drink instead of dinner, but when I didn't order a drink in the first round, I wasn't asked again. It was as though I ceased to exist. When he brought the dessert menus he gave one to everyone at the table except me. There wasn't anything on the dessert menu that I could have, but acting as though I was invisible is simply unacceptable. If I could have left I would have, but I didn't want to cause a fuss and ruin my friend's birthday.  As it turns out, my friend's birthday was ruined anyway. It wasn't just me the server was terrible to. He treated our entire group as if we had done something wrong by sitting at his table. We came to celebrate a friend who had chosen this place for a nice dinner, but the service was so abysmal that my friend ended up feeling that he had subjected his friends to a terrible night out.  Again, I worked in the service industry for many years, in many capacities. I have a realistic idea of the difficulties (or not) of accommodating a large party and/or someone with allergies. I am very forgiving of the hardships inherent in working at a restaurant. My experience at Legume, and that of my entire party, was beyond terrible with no reason or justification for it.  The bottom line?  I have told everyone I know what a horrendous time I had. I would not set foot in Legume again. And I will continue to warn people against going there.",

    "text": "We came here during our short visit to Pittsburgh per the recommendation of some folks who know their food. Legume knocked it out of the park. It is easily the best dinner place in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is classy and relaxed; for example, we dig the welcoming smile and the laid back attitude of our maitre d'. Stephen--our waiter--was friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. He knew his sh*t and he gave us his candid recommendations (never overselling). I started with the duck and pork pate and went with the kielbasa ramp (house made and cured for 6 months!) for our main course. My wife had the stinging nettle soup and their ramp raviolis. All of our dishes were sublime. My kielbasa came with a \"grit cake.\" My impression was that I would get a few cubes of grit cakes (a la Charlie Trotter's) to \"remind\" me of white grit. Instead, I got a seared cake the size of a brownie. To finish the evening, both of us split the heart-warming sponge cake with poached pineapple. Along with a carafe of wine, this was a comfortable, inspiring, and impressive meal.  I wish I were a cow with 3 extra stomachs to eat everything on the menu. Legume is a classic bistro and it is obvious that the owner and the staff really care about the quality of their food. The serving sizes are refreshingly satisfying without being overwhelming. Even for a smaller market like Pittsburgh, they could raise the prices of each dish by 20% and still draw a packed crowd. If they were in Boston, hell, this would be up there with Craigie on Main (at half the price).  This is the real deal: food made by people who love food, served by friendly and knowledgeable staff, and at a reasonably price. Legume is the essence of a real bistro--the neighborhood joint that you want to be YOUR joint.",

    "text": "Although pates and terrines are re-emerging on the culinary scene for those looking to be placed in a swine induced coma, there is no mistaking one that is methodically crafted to balance the subtleties of meat, fat, spice, and texture.  The pork and duck pate with pistachios is a prime example of the harmonious balance of these elements, all of which are fully enhanced by the typical accompaniments of delicately brined cornichons and a smear of whole grain mustard.  The lightly toasted baguette provides a compact vehicle for one to experience what many would consider to be \"the perfect bite,\", however, the most pleasurable method of consumption proved to be with just a lowly fork.  The intricacies of the pate were fully expressed and an instantaneous pork euphoria commenced.   If the pate is not enough to satiate the appetite of a Sus aficionado, a recommendation for the braised pork shoulder in applejack is well deserved.  There are few combinations better than the sweetness of apple and the richness of pork, heightened by the fattiness this particular cut lends.  The slow braising allows the pork fat and collagens to act like a veritable meat candle, something your local home decorating stores should most definitely be investing in, providing succulent and tender meat and a gentle lingering mouthfeel.  The bed of polenta not only provides a pedestal for the main event, but a sponge that allows each drop of the accompanying braise reduction to be devoured.  The sauteed endive draped over the polenta like a piece of lingerie thrown over the side of the bed... initially it may not seem like anything special, but the slight bitterness cuts through the richness and helps maintain a perfect balance of what would otherwise become DEFCON 1 in the war on flavor.  A simple raclette with crusty baguette was a warm, gooey accompaniment to the meal.  Service was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu, two very important elements in a place that has a seasonal and ever changing menu.",

    "text": "I feel as though with most new restaurants, they tend to suffer in the details. This is really no different with Legume.  It is a charming small place, yet not suited for intimate dinners. The noise levels were atrocious to the point where you could not hear the person sitting across from you. You're just bombarded with noise pollution the whole time you're there. They had newly installed sound dampening panels suspended from the ceiling, but they need to install more and put them on the walls as well.   The menu is ambitious and the execution is good, price point is a tad high particularly for the neighbourhood.  When I was there, it didn't seem like the crowd was local Regent Square neighbourhood peeps.  The crowd consisted of groups of Babyboomers and anyone under 35 was there as a couple.   We had reservations, though it's confusing as to whether they take them or not. We had called a day ahead and told that they don't take reservations, but the next day when someone else answered the phone they happily accepted reservations.   Our server was fairly friendly and helpful. The owners walked around refilling people's waters and busing.   The decor is cute and tables are bare. The difference between a place in San Francisco and Pittsburgh is that both would have tin ceilings, but in Pittsburgh they would be painted.    We ordered Roasted Marrow Bones with Sea Salt and Toasted Country Bread and Sliced Lamb's Tongue with Potato Salad, Pickled Cucumber and Bistro Vinaigrette as the first course. The lamb's tongue came first and was delicious. However paired with their  bistro vinagrette, it was reminiscent of head cheese. I think the more delicate lamb tongue flavour was a bit overwhelmed  by the pickle that accompanied it. I think I would have preferred a white sauce with the lamb's tongue or just a dollop of creme fraiche. The marrow bones were great on the toast. I believe it was the olive farm bread from Mediterra bakehouse. A small ramekin with rock sea salt accompanied the  bones, but I felt a flakier finishing salt would have been better. It's difficult to put just a little bit of rock salt on.  I order the Arctic Char with Lentils, Red Wine and Potato-Celery Root Puree. The Arctic Char still had the skin on that was seared with a torch to a delicious crispness. The Potato-Celery Root puree was really good, very creamy.   My husband had the Fennel and Red Wine Pork Sausage with Creamy Polenta and Red Sauce. Though the sausage was very good, I thought the Red Sauce was not a good match with the sausage and the polenta was not particularly good or bad.   The presentation of all the dishes could be improved upon.   I don't know if I would make a regular point of going there, bec. it's impossible to have a conversation. Yet its price point is maybe too high for groups. Some people might balk at the price unless it was a special occasion. However it's not suited to special occasions either. It's difficult to classify this restaurant, bec. the price point and food would almost fit into a \"casual fine dining\" yet the atmosphere and decor is too casual for that. I think maybe it's for those who want something very casual and every day, but have more discretionary income? Maybe there's a Regent Square I don't know about, but I don't think my friends who live there could afford to eat at Legume so often.",

    "text": "My wife and I wanted to have French cuisine while staying a few days in the burgh. Well, we were very disappointed with what was presented. Reading other reviews about the taste and quality of this restaurant were very over rated. We both had the three course meal; very pricey for what is  served ($45) and the sirloin was chewy and too peppery; the cut was not right. The wine selection was fair at best; too overpriced for the selection that was presented. The first bottle we had was too green and chemical tasting. The second bottle was better but not worth $45. The ambiance is fair, but the music needs to change. The music did not match the attire for the place which was odd. Odd enough, our waitress was wearing jeans and so were a few others. Again, the staff attire did not match the ambiance of the place. Parking is not free ($2), but for how much we paid ($145, not including tip), it should be free. In our mind, if we are going to spend this amount of money, it must have more substance; better food and matching ambiance that warrants the price of the food.",

    "text": "It was a warm early summer night and Annie surprised me with reservations for this charming little bistro that I have been meaning to visit since it's opening, but for whatever reason just kept missing the opportunity.  However, after chatting with the chef at the restaurant party I'd renewed my urgency for visiting.  The restaurant is located on s. braddock ave. in regent square.  I used to spend more time here back when a friend lived near and its added a few good spots since (D's six pags and dogz for example, but I'll save that review for another time).  This is a nice area for date night with a few places for casual fine dining, independant flick at Regent square theater or shopping then pool and guiness at one of the local irish pubs.  Legume offers outdoor dining which is great especially when their is good people watching like there is here.  We weren't able to sit outside, but got a fine table in the intimate and dimly lit dining room.  It is a small place and unfortunately we were seated a little too close to some guy going on and on about \"hedge funds\", so it was a little too close for comfort.  I think there is like 8 or 10 tables mostly 4 tops.  The floors are hardwood and I like some of the details of the space itself such as the fixtures and art.  These folks also get the details as I noticed with the silverware they were using (I think \"Toast!\" uses the same type of simple ornate silverware).  A couple other non food details... It's byob for a small corkage fee of $3.  Many other spots charge $10.  You can feel comfy in Jeans, flip flops, or a suit and I noticed all forms of attire and all ages.  These folks are totally ingredient driven and I'm sure are into the whole farm to table movement and sustainability.  They change most of the menu daily and use top quality ingredients and often serve traditional fare with a contemporary flair.  Okay, onto the food.  We started with some good quality crusty bread and delicious room temperature high quality butter.  Our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive.  I started with the tuna tartar. It was a nice portion of sushi grade tuna with perhaps a citrus or some type of acid used to cut the richness of the fish.  It was okay, I mean it didn't blow me away, but was perfectly acceptable.  However, I have to admit I've had tuna tartare that seemed to have a more crisp or \"bright\" flavor if you will at other places.  Again, it was fine just not 5 stars.  Annie tried the Buttermilk soup with bulger, chickpeas and parsley.  Unfortunately, Annie didn't know it was served cold and that would have been a non starter for her before go.  I tasted it and not really being a fan of cold soup it wasn't my thing either.  I get what he was going for I think.  It was rich while also not seeming to be too heavy.  It had a very layered flavor and I noticed many different spices most notably curry.  I had the steak for my entree and I think it was served with mashed potatoes.  It was cooked perfectly, delicious and flavorful.  The mashed potatoes were also really good. I don't think I want to know how much cream and butter is used.  For me the steak was the first thing I had that I really liked here.  Annie had their famous \"Chicken cooked under a skillet with garlic and mashed potatoes\".  I really enjoyed this also and see why it is so popular.  The chicken was moist and I prefer this than to just boring chicken breast.  The skin was great and the mashed potatoes again were quite good.  We skipped dessert, however I think next time we'll definitely try them.  One last thing the waitress noticed Annie didn't eat her soup and insisted on taking it off the bill.  This place is quite good and probably deserves 3.5 stars.  I hope to do a better job on my choices next time and update this review with another star.",

The selection of vegetables was interesting, but for the amount that were on the plate, more of the dipping sauce would have been nice. I was surprise by ALL OF THE LAMB on the menu, but visited the website once I was back home and realized that there's a relationship with a butcher that involves lamb. Still, three lamb entrees while there's no chicken and other obvious proteins is a little weird. Also, the lamb was not prepared that well. What was really disappointing, though, were the two dead fruit flies in my Four Roses. The waiter actually returned to the table after taking my drink back to the bar to ask me if I still wanted the Four Roses--why, was there something wrong with it? They brought a replacement, but I was surprised I wasn't comped for the drink. Also, by definition, this place is not a bistro, but whatever. I really wanted to like this place. With the exception of the drink containing dead bugs, the wait staff was great, and I did think they had a nice selection of wines.",

Due to the whole pregnancy thing there were a couple things I can't eat. I wanted to try the whole roasted fish, which came with an aioli (raw eggs) and the chef graciously substituted a tomato sauce that was delicious-I can't imagine the aioli was any better! The roasted chicken is always spot on, with flavorful pan juices, crispy skin, and juicy meat.  Probably one of my favorite things I ever had were these Pork Rilletes, with a plum-rhubarb ketchup (tasted sort of like a BBQ sauce)- it was BBQ pulled pork elevated to a whole new level. The desserts are delicious as well. I LOVE their chocolate cake- and I do not have a sweet tooth! All in all, their ingredients are of the highest quality, their food is cooked and seasoned to perfection, and I've never had anything that wasn't delicious. It's only cons: it's TINY and can be hard to get a seat, 2) because they change their menu daily and get everything in fresh- they can run out of a particular dish (or dishes) even early in the evening.",
