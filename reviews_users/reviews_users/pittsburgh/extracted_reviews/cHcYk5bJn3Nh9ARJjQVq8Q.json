I probably order from here at least once a week. I always order the haydari for appetizer and chicken shish kabob for dinner. The haydari is AMAZING. Even my 2 year old son loves it. It comes with delicious soft bread. The chicken is cooked to perfection in cubes. I always order my chicken well done since they come in huge cubes and I know it's hard to cook 100% inside being that big and thick. The chicken kabob comes with rice that is buttery and so so good and a garnish salad that is very good & refreshing. Try this place. You will not be disappointed.",

A little research turned up the Turkish Grille. We ordered the mixed cold appetizer and the Turkish mixed grille entree. The food arrived earlier than expected, delivered with a smile. We opened it in the midst of a conversation and absentmindedly started to eat. The conversation stopped. All we could do was eat and talk about the food. Thank you for making such an unexpectedly wonderful night!",

I've been here for both lunch and dinner and the quality of the kebabs (had both chicken and lamb) were excellent. Fresh, hot, great seasoning and marination and very good quality meat. Also, we've tried the appetizer combination and the eggplant dishes as well as the humus were both excellent. I've been to a number of similar places (including some other good ones of course) and this is one I will definitely be coming back to as possibly the best food and definitely the best value. Also, the service is quite friendly and nice. By the way, for me, four stars is a great review.",

As soon as we walked in, we noticed how beautiful it was and how much work the owners put into it. It's extremely clean and uniquely decorated. It's casual but still a very inviting atmosphere. The staff is so polite and friendly and offered us Turkish tea right away while we figured out what we wanted to order. We ordered 2 lamb gyro wraps and fries to share. The food came really fast along with two sauces (1 spicy and 1 cool cucumber) for no extra charge! The wraps were super big, especially for how cheap ($8)!! The meat was so amazing and you can tell how it rested on a spit for hours, cooked authentically. All the veggies and herbs in the wrap were so fresh and everything was perfect together with the sauces drizzled in. The fries were only $3 and could easily be shared between 2-4 people as a side. They were really crunchy but soft on the inside, like diner French fries. The complimentary Turkish tea was yummy to have with the meal and added to the experience. This place far exceeded our expectations in all aspects. These people have put in a lot of work to create an awesome experience and they're doing it. We highly recommend Turkish Grill for anyone who wants a quick bite of amazing quality food for cheap in a wonderful environment!",

Not cheap, but the portions were sufficient for another meal for each of the three of us. The dining space was bigger than we had guessed from outside, it's off the beaten path, but it was bright, clean and had white table cloths. A good view of the kitchen adds to the comfort level. I'd recommend to the house to upgrade their takeout-ware, the cheap tinfoil can't be microwaved and there is much better snap-shut plastic available. Definitely on our list of local spots  for casual dining.",

We were greeted by Selim on a frigid night and choose a table in the nearly empty restaurant. Between us, we shared an appetizer mix, a lamb kebab, and chicken adana kebab plate. The food was delicious and reasonably priced.  During the meal, a man dining alone at the next table tried several times to introduce himself into our conversation and eventually came over to ask to join us. We begged off but the encounter was quite strange so we got tuned into his table. At the end of his meal, the man dashed rather than paying. We were shocked but Selim took it in stride. When I asked about it, I learned that there had been signs that problems were afoot. I was so impressed that Selim and the restaurant were so mellow in the way they handled this apparently troubled man. I offered to pay his bill but Selim wouldn't let me. There was something so gracious and kind in the way this was handled. Hence my review: Good heart. Good food.",

The lamb, chicken, and veggie kabobs are tasty, the rice is of high quality and the pitas always contribute the carb tastes we all love. The complementary wine from signing in from Yelp is awesome! The only downside is sometimes there isn't as much meat that you would expect for its price. The quality is top notch, but when it doesn't fill the plate or your belly we are sometimes left wanting just a bit more~",

We didn't realize the entrees came with rice so we ended up with more food than we could finish. Even the house salad was good. Would definitely visit again. We were the only ones in the restaurant, maybe it was just the timing, not sure why. More people should visit the Turkish Grille!",

    "text": "What a delightful surprise!  I just tried this restaurant, having never heard of it before, because they left a stack of brochures today in the lobby of my building.  I was hungry, and in the mood for some kind of grilled meat because of something I smelled in the elevator on the way down to take my dog out - and there were these brochures just sitting there, so I decided to take a chance, and ordered takeout, sight unseen, and without even checking Yelp.  I ordered enough food for two people for more than two meals - 4 appetizers, one main course, and dessert, plus a drink.  I figured I'd just try it all right out of the gate - and did I mention I was really hungry? :-)  Excellent tabouli (more parsley than bulgur wheat, as many places make it), wonderfully lemony stuffed grape leaves, and babaganush to die for.  It's smoky, with nice, small, even chunks of eggplant, not pureed beyond all recognition like most places do it.    I also ordered the spinach cigarette borek, which I've never had before.  I had expected it to be crispy since it was fried, but turned out to be more chewy instead, possibly because of sitting on top of some tomatoes and lettuce and in a box in transit before landing on my table.  The pieces were much thinner than I was expecting, too, and so had a lot more phyllo than filling, but it was still very good.    I wanted the adana kebab for my main course, but they were out of it, so I got the izgara kofte, which is called kofte kebab elsewhere, but this was served as 5 patties of beautifully seasoned meat rather than a sausage-like kebab style item.  It was a little dry and tough, making it rather chewy, which was disappointing, but it was still absolutely delicious.  It was served on top of buttery rice that is also yum, and a side salad chock full of tomatoes with a vinaigrette that is not like that in most Mediterranean restaurants, but still very good.    The pita is obviously freshly homemade, very light and fluffy/puffy and a bit smoky, also very unlike what is found in most places, and still soft and toasty warm by the time it got here.  With everything I ordered, I got 4 of them, and they are all absolutely huge, so that ought to keep me for quite a while.  I couldn't even eat a whole one - but then again, I had a ton of food and didn't want to fill up on the pita.  I also ordered ayran, which is a yogurt drink that is a little bitter and otherwise pretty bland.  I think I'll save my money next time, at least at home, since I think all I'd have to do is pop some Greek yogurt into some water and mix it up.  I was expecting some more flavor and seasoning, although maybe I'm thinking of another cuisine.  Baklava is, for me, a must-have at a Mediterranean restaurant.  This was good but a little odd: not as sweet as most of them are (which was actually a bit of a relief), and almost a bit chocolatey in flavor, not as intensely pistachio-like as most, and a lot dryer, without the honey usually found in baklava, and denser overall, including the phyllo.  It was still good, but didn't have me clamoring for more, and I will try other deserts next time instead.  Of course, since there were four small pieces, which translated to roughly two regular size ones, it was still quite a bargain for a desert that is usually stupidly expensive.  Chintzy this serving most definitely was not.  Overall, a pretty predictable menu virtually identical to what one finds at almost every other Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant, with all of the expected staples, much like the stereotypical tacos and burritos at Mexican restaurants, but with a lot more well-blended flavor than at many.    I'm sure the Turks don't eat these same things every day any more than anyone in any other Middle Eastern country does, or than Mexicans usually eat most of what we get in most Mexican restaurants, but it was all still very good.    I would love to see them branch out and offer more of what Turks really do eat, though, like Naya in Squirrel Hill hews more to *real* Syrian cuisine and away from the stereotypical and predictable same old same old Middle Eastern fare.  This chef clearly has the control over the seasonings that would make me believe that he/she could also easily turn out a more authentic menu and be successful with it. They do at least have some fish items on the menu, which I haven't seen in any other Mediterranean restaurant that I recall, which I will likely try next  They also have a deal that gives you a 10% credit towards future purchases if you order online.  I called instead, though, because it was already 9:15pm, and I didn't know if they would actually get my order in time.  They said it would take 50 minutes - but the guy showed up in a little over half an hour instead.  I see from the photos that there are stairs to get into the restaurant itself, which doesn't bode well for wheelchair accessibility, but I also don't know if they've got a rear entrance that might be accessible.",

We each ordered a bowl of lentil soup and shared the Turkish Grille Mixed to sample a bit of everything. The lentil soup was flavored well and it came with a slice of lemon that added a nice zing. The Turkish Grille Mixed came with lamb kebab, a lamb chop, chicken Adana, kofte, tomato salad, and rice with little short noodles in it. It's also supposed to come with doner kebab but it wasn't ready when we ordered(~11am) so Selim let us substitute it with lamb Adana. I just realized that he added some chicken kebab as well! Everything in that dish was cooked well, flavorful and had just the right amount of char to it. The tomato salad was a bit on the salty side but other than that, it was a great dish! I love bread and I was excited that our meal came with fresh pita bread! It had the perfect amount of fluff and just the slightest char on the outside that added a good texture.  I highly recommend this place if you want a great and filling Turkish meal! I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in town!",

Istanbul Sofra is really good, too. And I like Pasha Cafe Lounge.  This place, Turkish Grille is satisfying and inexpensive, it is a little hidden away a little bit off Centre Ave and parking can be a little tough.  But I have eaten here a few times and everything I have tried here has been OK.  More competition:  Turkish Kebab House opened up less than a mile away.  They are about the same as Turkish Grill.  and there are even more Turkish places here that I haven't tried yet!",

As for the gyro wraps, they were stuffed with lots of meat, but the sandwich was not very flavorful at all. The sandwiches were also inconsistent -- we ordered two, and one was super greasy and the other too dry. The hummus was ok. Not the best I've had, but not the worst. I prefer my hummus to be a little more smooth. The pita it came with was soggy (although it was delivery so I am sure there are challenges with preventing that).   The fried feta roll up sticks were also only ok.   Would not recommend this place. There are better options for Mediterranean food in the city.",

I also got a chicken and a dish called chicken Donner and I would prefer the more seasoning on the chicken personally but for most people I think it would be good I had like heavy spices. Everything was excellent and my waiter was very nice everybody there was very nice it's a small place. Probably would recommend reservations on a Friday or Saturday evening this place to eat is very unique I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their Gyros and other fare on their menu. Also it's located only one block away from my other favorite ethnic restaurant in Pittsburgh, Tamarind",

    "text": "My favorite Turkish place in Pittsburgh. I've been there hundred times after the moment I found out it was reopened with the new management and new cooks. So now I finally decided to write a review because my feelings to this place can no longer stay untold.  When I dine in a Turkish restaurant, I always get lamb shish kebab, it has become a tradition to me. Having tried all the shish kebabs in Pittsburgh, I can say for sure that the best one is at Turkish Grille. Tender, soft, flavorful, outstanding (!!!). I also love their shrimp kebab which comes with a tasty sauce perfect for seafood. And most of the meals come with the side of rice and delicious fresh salad.  Have to mention brilliant deserts. My favorites are kazandibi (milk pudding) and kunefe (shredded wheat with mozzarella cheese and syrup). That feeling when you get a desert and a cup of Turkish tea... or a small espresso-like Turkish coffee.   One more feature of this place is quick and friendly service. Very pleasant guys who make you smile and feel comfortable like you're home. :)  To sum up, I definitely recommend this place for all meat and desert lovers. Menu is very far from being pricy. Turkish Grille is absolutely worth visiting. Will come back many more times!",

Positives: - side salad that comes with the gyros is decent - pita was pretty good  Negatives: - Chicken is dark meat and white meat & skin and oily. A negative for me, but may not be for others - gyro is fatty and not very flavorful - hummus has a nice consistency, but is bland - White sauce is watery and flavorless - hot sauce is sambal oelek, an Asian chili sauce. Not what you'd expect from a Turkish restaurant  Overall: disappointed  The delivery was on time and the driver was friendly.

Well, this is a Turkish type of a restaurant and it is indeed the fastest food ever: we were a group of 2, we were seated on a table, we gave our orders and our orders arrived within a span of 3-4 minutes. I do not exaggerate, it is really this fast.   As for the food, this is \"Iskender\" a Turkish speciality. They serve bread (a delicious type of bread indeed), tomato sauce, yoghurt and salad next to it. It was really good . Ambiance is just like a Mediterranean restaurant . Prices, reasonable.   If you're around, you can try this place and it really worths a special visit.",

    "text": "We drove all the way from Chicago just to have dinner here! OK, J/K! We drove to Pittsburgh to check out Carnegie Mellon for my son and I was craving some kunefe and thought why not go out for a Turkish dinner.   The restaurant is small but I loved the small touches that reminded me of Istanbul - especially the beautiful, mosaic lamps hanging from the ceiling. We came here on a Monday night and were seated promptly. Yelper tip: check in on Yelp and get a complimentary glass of wine. You get a glass of red wine that is slightly sweet. It was a bit too sweet for my taste but hey, it's a nice gesture.   Let's dive into the meal, shall we? We ordered a variety of different entrees. My son always gets the Iskender and this one was probably one of the best he had. The doner and pide was cooked perfectly and the red sauce was buttery. The dollop of yogurt on the side was thick and reminded me of the homemade yogurt my mom makes. My kids also ordered the hummus and the calamari. The hummus comes with a basket of warm pide - this is a great appetizer - definitely get this. My kids loved the calamari so much that they ordered a 2nd one. Spoiler alert - the calamari looked like onion rings, but, it's calamari and it was the perfect texture, not chewy at all. I especially liked the white dipping sauce on the side. It reminded me of cacik but had a thicker consistency. We also ordered the doner entree - the rice on the side tasted just like how my mom makes it. There was also a small shephered salad on the side but although it was good, it could have been fresher. We also got the mixed grill. It's big enough for 2 to share and it did not disappoint. My daughter said the lambchop was delicious and hubby and I enjoyed the chicken adana, shish kebab, doner kebab and kofte.  After a satisfying dinner, the kunefe and Turkish tea hit the spot. My youngest got the Turkish pudding (sutlac) and it was delicious with a hint of vanilla. Overall, this was a great meal and we will definitely be back when we are back in town.",

We were so glad that we found this little gem! We shared the mixed hot appetizer (the zucchini cakes were our favorite!) and he got the dumplings and I had the lamb. We agreed that everything was as good as the food we ate in Istanbul and truly enjoyed our meal. The owner's comped our cokes, our Turkish tea, and our baklava. Tip - get the baklava!! It was outstanding. We will definitely come back on our next trip to Pittsburgh!",

Fresh Mediterranean salad, rice pudding and Turkish coffee for dessert. Exactly what I was looking for. The presentation was creatively done. I have nothing bad to say. Go! Enjoy! Price is right!",

    "text": "I apparently have a different opinion here, but I think this food is just okay. It's edible! But lacking in flavor, unless that flavor is too much vinegar and too much dill. The service is really slow. It's a smaller restaurant with cafe style tables. There were 2 other tables and a larger party of roughly 8 people when we walked in. When we ordered, he didn't write anything down, which always makes me nervous. I ordered falafel, a salad with dressing on the side and grape leaves. He was confused as I was ordering which worried me even more. It took a very long time for the food to come out after the appetizers, and mine came out incorrectly. There was a ton of vinegar all over my salad. I sent it back and told them I didn't want it replaced. It took over 30 minutes for them to come check on me in order for me to actually send it back though.   The falafel was good. It wasn't hard or dry or too nutty. The grape leaves were very strong tasting, probably too much so. We ordered baklava, which was decent. One waiter brought out an extra dessert to make up for the salad which was nice and pretty tasty. It was milk pudding with cinnamon on top. However, it then took at least 20 more minutes afterwards and they still hadn't given us our check. We waived our credit card and he just took it so we didn't even know how much it was.   Over all, a weird experience. Definitely not close to 5 stars.",

I opted for the adana because in my experience it is more consistent than the shish, but I would definitely be back for the shish. It was so tender! Both meats were seasoned really well. The main dishes came with rice and a really tasty salad. The online menu says that it would also come with grilled tomato and pepper, but it didn't. It also says you can choose rice or makarna. I may ask for the makarna next time because I am not a huge rice (pilaf-style) person.    I think the price was extremely fair for the quality and portion. I will definitely be back and may try ordering online as well!",

Just one waitress was there however considering that only two tables were occupied at each time, they didn't need more staff. The service was good but a bit slow. It took a long time until she took our orders and finally brought the food to our table. Another downside is not serving alcohol. The food was decent but not special. Like the food you can find in any other Turkish restaurant in the town. We ordered cold appetizer plate. The size was good and the appetizers tasted very good. We also ordered Eskandar kabob that came with a relatively small size. And the mixed grill platter that was very good and tasty. The best part for me was their tea and baklava. One of the best. The price was fair. In sum, we enjoyed the experience and recommend this place for family our friendly gatherings over a nice middle eastern meal in a quiet place with good ambience and service. You can bring a bottle of wine with you and they will serve that for you.",

With fresh meat, butchered and prepared on site, and a grandma behind the recipes and cooking, you know it's going to be good! After 11 months under their wings the kitchen is working well. The prominent and beautiful Turkish chandelier is accented by colorful table cloths and pictures of famous Turkish monuments creating a cosy ambiance for a pleasant meal. The portions are more than enough for a hungry guy/gal and maybe even leaving enough for some take-home. Vegetarian options abound and the cold combo as an entree is a great choice. The accompanying warm bread is excellent and worth an order on its own. The lamb Izgara Kofte were moist on the inside and charred outside giving it a perfect texture. My only nit was they did not get my side right and its byob. Highly recommend.",
