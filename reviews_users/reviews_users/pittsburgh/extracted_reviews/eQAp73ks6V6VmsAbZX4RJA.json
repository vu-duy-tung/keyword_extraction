Fresh fries, cheesy mac and cheese and more accompany as sides. The companies values of recognizing military personnel and commitment to service are demonstrated around the restaurant and in their quality of service.",

I got a half chicken with a side of their southern green beans (slow cooked and a little spicy and Smokey with onions and bacon), and my friend got the pulled chicken sandwich with French fries and Mac and cheese. My half chicken was super flavorful and moist, you can really tell the people working here care about the food they're making. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food they are serving. I ended up taking half of my chicken home for lunch tomorrow. And most importantly, this restaurant chain supports a fantastic cause. The entire restaurant is decorated in serviceman memorabilia, and they even play the national anthem and ask everyone to stand up to show their respect everyday at noon. The staff members are super friendly and helpful. From my first interaction with the cashier (where she greeted me with a smile and a \"how are you today\" instead of \"what can I get for you\") to the nice busboy who came to our table to ask if he could clear our trays for us, to the overall attention to cleanliness of the whole staff, this really is a great place to eat. I would highly recommend this restaurant to a friend.",

Also,the portions are great and really not too horrible for you on the calorie end.  On the other side of things, it's so refreshing walking into a place and getting genuinely greeted. Upon ordering, the cashier recognized it was my first time and recommended the turkey. Was a great choice! Then made sure I tried a special sauce on it.  After finishing my sandwich I went to throw away container and one of the workers took it right out of my hands. It was a really nice experience and you can tell these employees enjoy the atmosphere mission bbq creates. Can't wait to go back and recommend to friends. I appreciated the detail each employee added to my singular transaction and want to make sure it didn't go unnoticed. It's pretty rare and incredible to make such a great impression in about my 15 minute visit! Kudos.",

Ever since moving back to Pittsburgh from Western Ohio, where I became a fan of City BBQ, I've been on a quest to find good Barbque.  Mission Barbque, you have filled this void.  I've tried the brisket, pulled port, pulled chicken.... oh my, it is all so good.  The Mac n'Cheese is killer!  The green beans and baked beans are both awesome.  The only thing that I still need to try is the ribs.  Also, if you could add corn bread hushpuppies my bbq life would be complete.  I forgot to mention the really good array of sauces.  This place is priced right, the flavor is out of this world, the staff are awesome, what more can I say?  Get there, fast.  Go often... I will be.",

My wife has the pulled chicken and Didn't care for it.  It was a little dry and the smoke flavor was less than she likes.  Mine was spot on and I like a good smoke flavors. She enjoyed the KC sauce and it saved it.  Personally I think good smoked food should stand in its own.  My plate did as described.  Place overall rates 4 stars.  It was a little busy and got dirty floors but the staff took care of it.  It's fast food bbq but so much better than that.  I've had better in Memphis but Ive also had had a whole lot worse. I'd come again and that's all that matters right?",

The meat sampler with sausage, ribs, and brisket was dry and the sausage tasted like grocery store sausage. The chicken platter was dry and tasted like a refrigerator. The only thing that made it edible was the option to add you own sauce. Smokey mountain was good, tastes like sweet baby Ray's that you can buy in the store. Mac -n-cheese had undercooked noodles and runny cheese sauce and tasted like something you would get in a box. The fires are the best part of the meal. I would qualify this meal as fast food BBQ at best. Sorry. I do support your mission, but you need to up your food game.",

What's most amazing about this place on top of the great food and service is the atmosphere and the \"mission\" of truly giving back to our military and local police, fire and EMS.  I've been to many Mission BBQ's so I'm excited to finally have one in Pittsburgh.  I was there on opening day and was amazed as I witnessed the owner and two other employees walk a bunch of senior citizen home residents out to their shuttle bus after lunch.  They even helped them get on the bus too.  This place is top notch and every business should strive to be like this place.",

We also always split an order of fries, which are a great way to try all of the bbq sauces without them getting mixed on your sandwich! If you have ever been to Famous Daves, it is very similar in the sense that the sandwiches do not have any sauce on them and you get 7 choices at your table to put on top (the Memphis is my favorite, my boyfriend switches between Smokey Tennessee and Tupelo Honey). They also have that North Carolina vinegar stuff if your into that. The only reason I gave this location 4 stars and not 5 is because the kids who work here can be a little cliquey and are more interested in talking to their coworkers than the customers. I didn't get the fries I ordered once and stood there for a very long time trying to get someone's attention but they were all talking and didn't notice me across the counter. Other than that, the food is delicious!!",

You walk up to the counter place your order and then your name gets called when it's ready. It was pretty busy, but they keep things moving quickly. Not to mention when we were finishing up, a man who looked to be the owner and/or manager stopped to see how everything was. Those gestures make me want to come back to restaurants. He also stopped over at the table next to us to thank the man for his service (it was National Korean War Veterans Day) and I am pretty sure those veterans ate free that day!   I ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of mac. My mom ordered a half rack of ribs with mac and green beans. Not only does this restaurant give back to the community, but their BBQ is top notch. The sandwich is by no means skimpy the bun to brisket ratio is perfect. Also, the bun is super soft and the brisket is nice and juicy. They have 6 different sauces and I made sure to load my sandwich up with all the sauce. I liked the Memphis Belle the best! The mac and cheese was pretty amazing too; it wasn't too soupy and a little more on the drier side which is how my mom and I like it (it was still cheesy nonetheless).   Thanks for coming to the 'burg Mission BBQ! I can see myself making many trips here. Don't forget to sign up for their Birthday Brigade. It will get you a free sandwich on your birthday.",

The portions are generous- the kids' ribs meals had a lot of meat on them, too. All of the meats are great- it is hard to pick a favorite. Was very well staffed on an Sunday- friendly and fast. Stuffed a family of four for about $40.",

My friend and I ordered the pulled chicken with the macaroni and cheese. We loved it.  Such a great new addition to Robinson Township with a great hometown feel.  Everyone that worked there were all so nice and friendly. It really makes you feel like you are down South.  They have a nice patio set up with picnic benches and lights. We will return! Lastly, the six different bbq sauces on every table is great !",

Not only are these smoked meats packed with an atom bomb of flavors, it comes with a side of fresh cut fries picked from the potato patch out back. Excellent staff, Chick Fil A level, including the manager. This one really brought me back to my roots. When you get a second, check out their mission statement.",

It was all so good but I will say the beans where pretty hot had to let them cool a bit before indulging but luckily I bad some beef to stuff my face with. Thank you and keep up the great work.

First off, get there before noon so you can be there for the daily salute to the good Ole USA with the playing of the National Athem. There was a short line but it moves fast and you can look at the menu that are at the door will in line.   Staff was freindly and helpful and there were staff on the floor cleaning tables and helping out.   There are 6 BBQ sauces in bottles on the table (that you can buy too) and a larger or seventh NC Vinegar bottle.  So many to try with a description to help you choose.  A couple were very smoky tasting.   One was a Tulepo Honey with some bite that was way different and one I really enjoyed.  Also a Bay BBQ sauce that has a Maryland style flavor.   I decided to try the Sampler plate that gave me three choices of meat, some corn bread and a side of Mac & Cheese.  The three meats I choose were the Brisket, Pulled Pork anand Sausage (had the Jalapeno flavored).  The Brisket and Sausage were very tasty but the Pulled Pork lacked any real flavor and really needed some BBQ sauce.  A really nice place and addition to the neighborhood.",

Not much else is needed when the brisket is so tender, juicy, and flavorful. The ribs were pretty good too, and tender enough to quite literally fall right off the bone. The baked beans and creamed corn were enjoyable sides. The corn bread was a bit on the dry side.   Recommended!",

So much so do they endorse their military affiliation that work stops for the national anthem at noon everyday.   I got a sampling of their fare including ribs, sausage, turkey, pulled pork, and brisket, sides were baked beans and collard greens. What was really impressive was their six different sauces (varying in styles from Kansas to Carolina). Their turkey was smokey and moist, sausage had chunks of cheddar throughout, pork butt was well shredded and went best with the table vinegar.   Aside from the food, the service was impeccable, even with it being the lunch rush. highly recommend.",

Some of the best bbq I've had. The menu is a la cart and portions are generous. They have brisket, pulled pork, prime rib, etc etc etc and tons of fixins. If you go hungry here you aren't human. They have several sauces to choose from to sauce up your meat. They have a selection of bottled soda beverages as well as fountain soda, in addition to a few draft beers available.

    "text": "It's about time Pittsburgh got more barbecue options! I've been driving by the old Bob Evans for a few months now anticipating what was going to take its place. Much to my surprise it was a new barbecue spot in my neck of the woods.  I've gone 2 times now because once just isn't enough. Both times I tried something a little different. My first visit I got the pulled pork sandwich. The sandwich comes piled high with meat. So much meat it's difficult to get your mouth around the whole sandwich at times. My second visit I got the lean brisket sandwich. It was equally as delicious and I honestly don't know which one I liked more. The sandwich come without sauce on them because they have 6 different types of bbq sauces at each table. Each one having a slightly different taste than the other so everyone is bound to find one they enjoy.  As far as sides go I've tried 3 of them now. My personal favorite is the mac n cheese and I would definitely recommend it. The baked beans were a little too smokey tasting for my liking but if you like the smokey taste you would enjoy it. The cole slaw is just ok in my opinion. There's nothing necessarily wrong with it. It's just not my favorite cole slaw.  While the bbq is definitely the selling point at this place, I would just like to comment on the service at Mission BBQ. Everyone is extremely nice. Each visit there was someone walking around asking how everything was and asking if we needed anything. The pop machines were having issues running out of Pepsi both times I visited and as soon as the staff was notified they quickly fixed the issue. I will be recommending Mission BBQ to my friends and family!",

When you enter Mission, you'll approach the register to choose your meat and side selections. The Meats range from standards such as Pulled Pork, Ribs, Brisket, and Smoked Turkey with a few outliers like Smoked Meatloaf, Sausage, or even Prime Rib at times.  They have a variety of side like fries, mac and cheese, beans, coleslaw, cornbread, and sometimes stuff like collard greens and corn pudding.  They serve a small beer menu of locals/domestics and a couple of fancier beers but don't expect anything crazy.  There's a choice of multiple BBQ sauces on the tables and you can ask them (and you should) for the Alabama white BBQ sauce.  Let me stress that this is not table service. You're not tipping anyone. You order, receive your food, get your drinks, sit down and enjoy.  Service is on point and friendly and everything in the restaurant is very patriotic, right down to them stopping service at noon everyday to sing the National Anthem.  Don't expect the best BBQ you've ever had, but expect something that, for fast, is probably the absolute best you can get.  Definitely worth a try!",

They have several sauces to choose from; which is really nice. Their baked beans are amazing. I have gotten the chicken and lean brisket; my go-to as I can never decide between the two. Everything is easy to eat there or take out. Everyone I've encounter has been really nice. The restaurants are also very clean. They never seem to run out of condiments (considering they are all kept in a tool table there are plenty). Good food. Good atmosphere. Good people. Good cause. Good choice!",

I always have the best experience here now that I have come a few times. When you walk up, you can pick between different meats and sides. They let you try the food if you aren't which is so unheard of and my fav part.  Once you get your food, you sit down and the sauce is on the table so you can try one of their six sauces and they are all yummy. The staff working are always super nice and helpful. They ask if you need anything and they are happy to grab it for you. I just have a great experience every time I come here. They portions are enormous. I usually just get a meat and 1 side. I bought a cup from them so I just fill it each time I go. This place is worth like 5 tries !",

Only took a few minutes for the order to be ready. I had the pulled pork (NC style, I think that just meant coleslaw on top) and made it a combo. They had 6 sauces at the table and some sort of vinegar. I tried all, most were great, my favorite was the Bay-B-Que (the Maryland-style one). As far as the food, the bun was kind of blah but everything else was very good. The staff here was super friendly. A neat tradition is that they play the national anthem every day at noon, there were a lot of folks here in uniform so it was really nice to see.",

    "text": "My co-workers and I went here on our first night in the area. At first, I was just thrilled to find something in this area that wasn't a national chain!!  The staff was friendly when we ordered and helped explain to us how the menu worked and answer questions about specific menu items.  I was thrilled to see that they had the calories for each item on the menu board over the registers: you didn't have to look for a separate list, look at the printed menu, or ask...they were clearly visible as you ordered.  We were a little confused about the order/sit/wait for name process (especially since it was difficult to hear our names called), but we figured it out by watching others.  I ordered the sliced turkey with collards and green beans, while my co-workers all ordered some combination of brisket and pulled pork. All of us agreed that the sides were great: when the menu said \"spicy\" for the collards, I was a little nervous...but there was a little kick without being overwhelming.  As for the meats: - My turkey was incredibly tasty, even if it was a little drier than I expected. I could clearly taste the smoke around the edges and almost wished I was able to just get an order of the edges. I was glad I saved the small end piece for last! - My co-workers unanimously raved about the wet brisket.  Regardless of what other meats they each got, they all said the brisket was their favorite. From what I could see, the meat was moist but lean (one of my frequent disappointments with brisket is when half of your order is fat instead of meat). - My co-workers were either indifferent or disappointed in the pulled pork. One said hers was too dry and one said it just didn't have much flavor.  I can't speak personally, but none of them were impressed with the pulled pork.  We all liked the variety of sauces. I'm from North Carolina, so I was impressed to see a bottle of sauce similar to what I get at home. I chuckled when I saw that the label reminded customers to swirl the bottle to mix it up!  To be honest, it was not exactly like what I would get at home, but it was way closer than anywhere else I've been outside the south.  Overall, I would likely go back again; if nothing else, it was a good meal with friendly staff where I can make sure I stay on my calorie plan.",

Both sides were great and the beans are the best I've had in some time. Only thing different I'll do next time I'm in town is have the moist brisket. The young lady did inform me of the difference. Place has a cozy hometown feeling that reminds those that come here the cost and dedication that our military service men and women paid so that we could all be free. We will DEFINITELY be back",

The young lady taking the order was efficient and friendly. The food was ready quickly. Seating area was clean and kept up. The food? Yeah, it's good! I had a brisket sandwich and my son a rack of ribs. Then he had a second rack of ribs. The boy (11 yrs old and skinny as as rail)...well, where he puts it I dont know, but he was smiling all the way. He loved the food, including the side of collard greens (I had the greens too...yep, they're tasty!). So was the cornbread, and my brisket was terrific.  They have a nice selection of sauces available at the table...I liked the smokey mountain. Good service, selection and food prices right. Yep...this place'll do just fine. Try it!",

Greens are my favorite part and they were too salty and drowning in olive oil and whatever other liquids so that the actual portion of greens itself was very tiny.  The only thing that would have been promising were the fries, but they were cold. They tasted fresh cut, so I bet if they were warmer I might have liked them. They had a to  of sauces but the only one I really liked was a smokey one.  I probably wouldn't hit this up again unless I was desperate for BBQ while in the Robinson area.",

I guess they don't advertise so I didn't realize it has been open since this summer.  I ordered take out and had the brisket sandwich and got the 2 meat platter (smoked turkey and pulled chicken) for hubby.  His platter came with sides so got him greens and the Mac n cheese.  Their Mac n cheese is soooo good I should've doubled up on it but the greens were actually tasty too.  Cornbread was blah - kinda dry.     The staff was super friendly and the line moves so fast.  I loved the smoky mountain sauce but they have quite a few options so I'm sure you'll find one you'll like.   I love they really support our troops in so many ways.  Their food is delicious!",

It had great reviews so like any yelped, I decided to go and try it. I absolutely loved it! The environment is nice and clean. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with two sides and a drink. The mac and cheese is AMAZING!! Definitely try it! Although I did takeout, they gave me a sample for each sauce (6 total). My favorite was the smoky mountain. The pulled pork was tender and delicious! You must try this place as it's good and reasonably priced.",

I finally gave in and O-M-G was he ever right. Mission BBQ is down right delicious.  To be honest, it reminded me a lot of Hattie B's in Nashville (minus the hot chicken). You order at the register and have a brief wait to either sit-down or take-out your meal. Plus, like Hattie B's it's GOOOOD. I had the Brisket (fatty, because they have options) and it was melt in your mouth tender. The sides of Mac'n'Cheese, Cornbread, and Coleslaw were also on point. I was impressed and will be back.  I don't think you can go wrong with eating here.",

Normally in Robinson alot of food joints are stuffy and you really dont feel welcome (from my experience) but here as soon as we walked in, we were greeted by i think his name was Luke or something along those lines. This was our 1st time in this establisment and he personally made sure that we were comfortable, food was to our liking, he even gave us coupons for our next visit.   oh i didnt talk about the food....GREAT! Jalepeno & cheese stuffed kielbasa are amazing. I think i will go back today.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Hubby and I each ordered the 3 meat platter combo.  I ordered the pulled chicken, Jalapeno sausage, and brisket with a side of collard greens.  Hubby ordered the jalapeno sausage, ribs, and pulled chicken.    What's Hot - Quality of food.  For a chain, they're not so bad.  The jalapeno sausage is spicy and cheesy.  Their meats, for the most part, are tender and flavorful.  They have flavorful sauces, as well, which are available at each table.  I really liked their mustard bbq sauce, which you can't find at the table.  They have additional sauces on the side, which you have to go through. - Menu variety.  Straight forward and simple.  It looks like their sides rotate depending on what they have. - It's a chain.  Good BBQ chains are not easy to come by, especially because the quality of the food varies.  This place isn't so bad.  We've been to the Mission BBQ in North Carolina and they're pretty damn similar.   - Layout.  There's indoor and outdoor seating, which is nice when the weather is decent.  What's Not - Service.  I ordered the jalapeno sausage and received the regular sausage in my order.  The guy who took our order at the counter repeated our order like 3-4 times and still made a mistake.  Ugh...  Additionally, when we went to find a table, the one we found still had someone's junk/leftover trays on it.  None of the staff had cleared it off.  I ended up having to throw the stuff away because we couldn't find staff to clear the table.  To be fair, their staff are minimal and mostly behind the counter.  They don't seem like they're adequately staffed to deal with the crowds.  - Avoid the lean brisket.  When you order brisket, they ask you if you want lean or moist brisket.  Definitely order their moist brisket.  Their lean brisket is dry.  The day we came here, the guy who took our order at the counter said they were out of moist brisket, so i was stuck with the lean brisket. - Layout.  There are a decent number of tables inside and outside.  However, they don't look like they're adequately staffed to handle large crowds.  It probably depends on the day and time, but just be aware.  Final Answer Willing to come back, but be aware of the day and time.",

Look out, rib fest, they have what you don't- seating and air conditioning. No need to rub elbows with a bunch of sweaty drunk people when you can come here all year round!

    "text": "This is probably my favorite BBQ restaurant EVER.    First, the food is fabulous.  Let's start with the meat.  Since it was our first time here, we HAD to order at least a half a pound of everything except the brisket.  We doubled down on that at picked up a full pound.  The brisket is the best that I've ever had.  Hands down.  Super tender, moist, touch of smoke and great flavor.  The pulled pork was my next favorite then the ribs.   I honestly loved it all.    Now the sides, we loved the corn casserole more than the cornbread. If it's available, order the corn casserole.  It's like having cornbread, creamed corn and cake all in one!  My next favorite was the baked beans.  If you can't order it all, make sure you get these two sides.  You won't regret it.   The service was amazing.  EVERYONE was super kind and helpful and knowledgeable.  They seemed to love what they do and take great pride in serving us.  They took our orders quickly and shared their favorites which became our favorites.  I loved their energy and smiles.   Finally and most importantly, I love their mission.  Their purpose why.  The decor was inspiring.  The pictures, the quotes, all of it.    Combine it all, food, service and mission and it's a great place to go.  When we return to visit, we are certain that we will be back - over and over again.",

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the employees. The cashier taking our order was friendly and courteous. One worker asked if it was our first time and directed us to the drinks and condiments and let us know he would bring us our food. We had our baby with us and another man went and got a sling to put the baby carrier and later came back to chat with us. Another worker cleaned our tray from the table when he saw we were done eating. Everyone was so friendly and made you feel like they truly appreciated your business and wanted to take care of you.  The food was great. I got the pulled pork and husband got the pulled chicken. There is a nice assortment of sauces on the table. Tupelo honey heat was my favorite. The pork was moist and tender and smoked to perfection. We had fries and coleslaw as sides and both were just right. And what bbq would be complete without cornbread (with the butter at room temp so it's not a rock when you try to spread it).  The one employee who came by to chat also filled us in on how the company gives back to the military and first responders. Also how they stop at noon to play the national anthem. Their appreciation for those who serve and for our country made me love the place even more.  Can't wait to go back.  Ps- our dinner was just under $20.",

I hope this becomes a routine practice versus a \"just opened\" activity.  The food was great! I have never had a bad meal at a Mission BBQ location.  The only negative comment on the entire experience is the food being served at the lower need of the warm scale.  Otherwise, I am happy Mission BBQ finally opened a location within commuting distance. I will keep coming back is long as the food is service continues to be outstanding.",

Ordered a sampler with two sides. $14 to go. Impressions...  Got the brisket and turkey. Both nicely smoked and tender. Generous portions. Tried the Memphis Belle sauce and liked it. Good balance of sweet and spice. There are five other sauces to choose from.  Sides: Cole slaw - Wasn't over soaked in mayo. Mild, subtle flavors. Long shredded veggies, not finely chopped. Cheesy potatoes - Delicious but very salty. Tender chunks of potato with lots of real melted cheese. Not that Mission is going to take my advice but... with all the salt in cheese, why add more if that's what's going on? Portions were good.  Came with cornbread which was moist and not too sweet. Good compliment for the smoky/spicy meats as was the cole slaw. Only the potatoes, which I enjoyed, stood out as less than ideal with the BBQ.  This place is NOISY, even between busy times. Could barely hear my name called when the order was ready. Loud music, people talking in raised voices to be heard over it.   No complaints about the service or price. Overall, if you like BBQ (especially brisket as it is served in Texas) think you will enjoy Mission.",

The pulled pork was delicious and moist, the fries were delicious and well seasoned, and the Mac n cheese was some of the best I've had in awhile, it's very rich.
