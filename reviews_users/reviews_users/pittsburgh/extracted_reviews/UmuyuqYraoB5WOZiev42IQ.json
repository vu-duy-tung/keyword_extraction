This place is only open M-F 11-5pm when most of us are at work. And don't even think about sneaking up on the weekends because they are closed on Sat & Sun. The only reason that I was able to enjoy anything from this place is that I took my birthday off from work and just so happened to walk-in and give this place a try. I'm thinking there may be a correlation between the business hours and the number of reviews. Anyhow if you are a student or work in Oakland do not miss this place! I however, will have to look elsewhere:(",

Not much in the way of ambiance, but a small, friendly, homey spot.",

She is the super nice Lebonese grandmother everyone wishes they could visit for Sunday night dinner.  The place has been around for 24 years and for good reason. To be honest this is my first time there despite seeing it regularly over the past couple of decades. Perhaps due to its pedestrian facade. Don't let the looks fool you. If you want fast luncheon style traditional Mediterranean food, this is the place to get great food at a great price. I had the kibbee and salad platter.  For $10.50, it came with 2 generous slices kibbee, a side of tangy hummus, large soft pita, and a salad with a giant hunk of feta for you to crumble on it. The salad was fresh and had included lettuce tomatoes onion mint Kalamata olives and a great vinaigrette. Nellie gave me great conversation free coffee and water and topped it off with a homemade Easter mamoul date cookie.  Like I said, it felt like I was eating at grandmas.  I'll be back for sure, and you should go there too",

I am so happy that I did - I got the #32 Gyro Meat, Hummus, Tabbouli, feta cheese and Olives - It was delicious - everything tasted fresh, it was a perfect combination and I got more than enough food for the price.

The service was fast and the owner was walking around in the shop talking to customers making sure everyone was enjoying things. So service is 5 stars, food is 4. I may come back in the future to try something different and see if their other options are any better.",

The meat was decent, and I could definitely taste lively veggies inside. I liked the parsnips but thought there was too much tahini. It was also filling which made it a decent deal in Oakland for $7.22.  I liked how the cashier (I am presuming the owner) knew his regulars and was friendly. I didn't like the wait time for a shawarma sandwich. A twenty-plus minute wait for an item without unique ingredients at a place that wasn't busy is too long.  I'd rate Nellie' three and a half stars, but I cannot thereby I am rounding up to four because I think they offer the best value for Gyro and Shawarma sandwiches in Oakland.",

    "text": "I wish there were an option for 2.5 stars.  I went back to Nellie's and it's OK, but I don't think it's A-OK.    I have an obsession w/ hummus.  I dont know what it is, but I'm guessing it's all the fat that is in the tahini that does it for me.  Sometimes the hummus at Nellie's is ok, but I'm spreading the word that (at least this week), the hummus at Nellie's is hummazing.  I hate myself a little for that pun but I get carried away by good hummus.  The hummus is good.  Because I've been to Nellie's three days in a row, I am now friends w/ the elderly gentleman who seems to own the place.  In fact yesterday, I got a kiss and a hug when I ordered my hummus!  I make friends VERY easily, and the same thing happens when I buy cheese at the Shadyside Mkt Dist so I think this is something I just bring out in people.  I dunno...I know I don't know him but if he keeps making that hummus we are going to be best friends!  Here is what I don't like about this restaurant:  1.  They dont really have lunch specials so if you get hummus and grape leaves as I did yesterday, it's $14 and that's a lot for lunch.  At least for me.  2.  there is no atmosphere.  This place has had the same wallpaper border since I started going there - ten years ago.  I think Nellie's has been in the same spot for at least 15 years.  3.  the place is kind of dirty.  My coat fell on the windowsill (i think it's the heater) and there was a line of gray dirt on my coat when I picked it up.  I don't think it has ever been cleaned.  The tables seem clean, but that is pretty gross.  Not so gross I won't be back, but gross enough I'm not sitting next to it the next time I go there.  They have good food at alright prices, and they're in a great location.  Try this place if you love greek/middle eastern food and it's convenient.  I wouldn't drive or go out of my way to eat here, but it's not bad.",

The menu is on the wall, and inexpensive Middle Eastern cuisine. I got the falafel platter, and hubby got the gyro.  Food was served quickly and on styrofoam--so don't expect bells and whistles, just basic, good food.  It was hot, my falafel crisp on the outside and warm on the inside.  The tabbouleh was fresh and pita chewy.  The owner was a real sweetheart, joking with me and giving my husband a hard time.  I suspect he does so for all the women ;)  He was kind enough to come out and talk to us later, telling us about his family and his wife, who makes the baklava, which I had been currently eating. I always appreciate that approach from owners and I think it's great for business.  This place is pretty popular for those who work in Oakland, and I can see why.  Cheap, delicious, and friendly atmosphere.  Will definitely have my husband bring Nellie's home in the nearer future.",

I had it catered once at a university event, then later I stopped to get a lunch to go and both times I was really disappointed.

And the meat ones have some kind of mystery meat that seems like the quality of pet food.  I had a falafel sandwhich and it was just dry and bland without much in it.  It didn't come with a side or anything and when I ordered a small side of grape leaves the total came out to over $13 which is pretty pricey for this type of food even when it's good. The service was friendly and fast but doesn't make up for the awful food.  There also isn't much seating area and there is no atmosphere at all.  Just a few tables in a sparse setting.",

All this time I thought that Baba D's was the be all end all for Gyros in Oakland, but they definitely have competition from the lesser known Nellie's.  The feel of this little corner restaurant really is that of a homey, authentic kitchenette. If I had a Greek/Lebanese/MidEastern grandma, this is how I would imagine her food to taste. I am going back many more times to try their dishes, but for now I will recommend the Gyros, the Special of the day (it's Chicken and Beef rice, I forget what it's called), and the baklava was awesome. I had the grape leaves and they were good, not incredible. I will go back to try their Spanikopita, Meat Pie, Spinach Pie, and Falafel, not necessarily in that order. We'll see what my stomach desires each time.  The prices are fair - the combo platters are $8.50, their a la carte dishes are in the $4-6 range. They are only opened Monday through Fridays from 11am to 5pm. They advertise deliveries too, but I don't know the details.  All of us walk by, drive by, and see this place so many times without stopping in. Trust me, it's about time.... that is if you find a parking spot in Oakland. Good luck!",

We ordered togo. The menu seemed extensive and reasonably priced. I got the chicken Caesar sandwich. Not sure why it's called Caesar since the only thing Caesar about it was the romaine. The cucumber sauce was okay but watery. My chicken was in huge chunks and tasted bland. The pita was like eating a wet paper bag. I like a lot of strong flavors in my food and this was just not for me.",

    "text": "Stopped by here today for their Oakland Restaurant Week special (which online says its $6 for any sandwich), except I paid full price for my gyro and didn't want to bother asking what was up because the owners were friendly and old and the establishment was packed for lunch. So for just a gyro itself, I paid around $8.50 including tax, which isn't horrible given that the food was super delicious but there are other places in Oakland where you can get a gyro, fries, and a drink for that price.  I ordered the gyro with everything on it, which was from what I could tell: onions, tomatoes, lettuce, hummus (or tzatziki sauce or maybe both)? Actually what ended up happening was that they mixed up mine and a different guy's order and I ended up eating a chicken shawarma gyro instead. I didn't protest and the guy behind the register insisted that it's \"practically the same thing\". I wasn't mad but that's also because I'm not a picky eater in the slightest. Also if there was a huge price difference between the two and I ended up paying more, I would probably be mad but I'm going to avoid looking. I think it would've been nice if he would've at least offered to make me what I ordered. The photo of the gyro that I snapped was a friend's that I ran into there.   The chicken shawarma gyro was delicious though. The veggies were really fresh. The sauce was SUPER delish and they give you a ton of meat. Besides the whole mix up with my order and not getting the restaurant week special price, everything else was super great. If you plan on coming here for lunch, I would recommend taking it to go because there is not much seating available.",

The wrap was huge! There were 4 falafel balls covered with lettuce, tomatoes, pickle, and a tarter sauce. The balls were crispy on the outside and warm and smooth In the middle. Delicious!  The real star of the show was the baba ghannouj. It was creamy and smoky and went perfectly with the cucumbers and pita bread it comes with. As you can see, one order is enough for your whole crew.  I'll definitely be returning!",

Shawarma: their shawarma is NOT shwarma. It's barely a chicken sandwich. The chicken is old, likely frozen, with a clumsy jumble of tomato, lettuce and red onion. The garlic paste isn't even a paste, it's liquid.   Falafel: a little better, but it was cold and bland. It was with the same clumsy mess of vegetables.

The ingredients were home made and fresh, the sauce/tahini was not too thick, but correct amount of moistness to other contents.  Salad was newly produced and fresh.  Would have been better if falaffel was hot, but that is on me because I picked it up late, so it is more than likely impossible to judge...we will assume it would have been hot.  The fallafel was garlicky and crisply fried.  They add a sour pickle inside, which is how I like it!  Asked for and received some hot sauce to put on in to go cup.  All in all it is a legit middle eastern sandwich as expected.",

It disintegrated when touched, turning into tiny crumbs that hid among the other ingredients, presumably out of shame.  The rest of the sandwich was also objectively terrible, from the stale, chewy pita to the weird, inexplicable pickle.  The next time that I'm in the area and hungry, I'm going to eat out of the trash can out front instead.  It can't be any more disappointing, and it'll certainly be cheaper.",

I came here for lunch and got a falafel sandwich. It was very tasty with a lot of a very tangy sauce, a touch of mint and some kind of pickle in addition to the falafel, lettuce and tomato. It was a good deal for a $7.50 sandwich.   The menu is large with a good selection of different sandwiches and platters.   The place is very small with a few tables. Not fancy at all, but just fine for a quick lunch.   You order at a counter and then your food will be delivered out to you. The gentlemen taking orders is very friendly in an old world type of way.   I'd definitely come here again.",

    "text": "I appreciated Lebanese/Mediterranean cuisine from an early age, having grown up in new castle, pa home to two phenomenal & authentic restaurants. Only going 50 miles south from there, I thought for sure the cuisine would be just as good, if not better in Pittsburgh! But then I would say the word \"kibbee\" and people would look at me funny!   There is a place in South Side that's good but I rarely head into that area. So I almost gave up hope.  That is, until I got a job in Oakland and turned to Yelp, I found an authentic and delicious little place that I've been to 3 times already. I can walk there. Any time, M-F. It's amazing.   So, Nellie's... as other reviewers have stated, isn't much in the way of \"interesting\" or \"decorative\" or any such adjective, really. What you see is exactly what you get. But they put the effort they saved on decor into their food. It is so flavorful. Fresh ingredients. Yum!   I am a huge falafal fan so that is what I have ordered every time and every time I am extremely happy. The only thing I will say is that the falafel and their house sauce is very tahini heavy! So this time I opted for the cucumber sauce and it helped to balance everything out.   I have also had one of their samplers including the hummus, grape leaves, and spanakopita and they were all perfection.  I don't think you can go wrong here, guys.",

But let me tell you how much I love this place and I've only been here twice. Now that I'm not eating meat, this is the perfect place for me, because there are so many options. My go-to option is #43 - Spinach Pie, Rice and Salad. The Spinach Pie is super flavorful and a decent size. The rice is also flavorful topped with almonds. And the salad, omigoodness the salad. Now, I'm not one to brag about salads, but the salad I've gotten from Nellie's is delicious. The vinaigrette is super tasty and I love how they give you a block of feta cheese for you to crumble yourself. And what I love about this place the most is that it's a family affair. There are family photos on the wall and you can identify those cooking and serving the food in the photos. Give this place a try, you won't regret it. Also, I'm planning to try this in the near future, but they also do catering and trays!",

I personally had the platter with hummus, baba ganoush and tabouleh, and it was all spot on. They were very generous with the pita as well.

However, the shop always seems kind of empty, despite being located at a prime location during lunch rush.   One day I decided to take the leap and order a chicken shawarma wrap from here. It's just a simple wrap, not much can go wrong right? Nope, it was so bland. There was no \"shawarma\" to my wrap. The wrap consisted of baked, unseasoned chicken breast with lettuce, onions, pickles and some chunky white sauce. Just look at the picture if you don't believe me (definitely not shawarma). The combo came with a dinky plate of fries and a can of soda. All that cost me $11.25. For a lunch special, it was quite expensive. There are better wraps elsewhere in Oakland for half the price.   I will probably not be coming back to this place because there are plenty of options walking distance away. If judging the food alone, Nellie's deserves a 1, but the service was great so I can't bear being too heartless. I had high hopes for this place and the owner is a total sweetheart, but the overall charm cannot mask the fact that the food here is mediocre and overpriced.",
