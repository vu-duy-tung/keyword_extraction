On top of that, the fried rice was over seasoned with soy sauce. They also over-sauced the General Tsao's chicken and I had to pour out the sauce so the chicken would not be saturated with it. I prefer Taiwan Cafe to this place which unfortunately is closed for the time being.",

It's very plain and simple on the inside. Don't expect anything else.   They offer a good combination of authentic Chinese food and American style Chinese food. We often get both. As for the American style food, the \"Amazing\" Chicken is their best. I swear the sauce is the same of Panda Exxpress'.   My favorite appetizer is definitely the crab rangoon. I have had this dish all over because it is so common but it's very, very good here.   The servers can be short and brusk but they're just busy and to the point.   I guess what I'm trying to say is give this place a chance but keep an open mind about service and appearance.",

Maybe it's the fact that it's off Forbes along a quiet side street, or that it doesn't look too inviting from the outside (no windows, and the sign is a bit run down :/). At first glance, the menu doesn't stand out too much either, but they do have some more authentic items; one might describe it as a bit more upscale than Golden Palace, without the buffet. They have some Cantonese offerings, but less extensive than the former. We went with that side of the meu and ordered a wonton noodle soup and a beef brisket noodle soup. Both were solid, particularly the beef noodle soup. The portion was generous in that they brought a huge bowl filled to tbe brim. The broth was super savory, and the beef was good quality, with a good balance between lean meat and fat for flavor. There were also some leafy vegetables as is standard with this dish. Overall I was very pleased with this, considering that it was only about $8.",

I've been through a solid amount in five years, and the bi-weekly Chinese Food Power Rankings certainly fluctuate, one place always stands out in those inevitable hungover-hungry-quickbite-fulldinner-preparty-postparty-craving moments: Tong's Cuisine.  I originally wrote out a list of reasons why I go here longer than their lunch specials, but deleted it in favor of a shorter summary:  It's affordable. It's quality. It's convenient.  Try the crab rangoon, try the braised ribs, try the spicy beef, or try the General Tso's. They're all pretty rad and blow away the competition, especially when it comes to filling that you-will-be-hungry-soon-order-takeout-now Chinese food void.",

I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. I was the only customer in the place, so I'm sure that had something to do with the lickity-split service.   My eggroll had been fried, but it wasn't crunchy. It was soggy and unappetizing. The broccoli w/ garlic sauce was even more disappointing. At $8.75 the portion size was much smaller than I was expecting, which turned out to be kind of okay because I didn't like it much. The sauce was watery and boring. It wasn't spicy or garlicky! Although there was some broccoli in the dish, it wasn't the main feature. The majority of dish was onions and celery and the broccoli that was in there was overcooked compared to what I expect from a stir-fried dish.   This was my first attempt at Chinese in Oakland, so I can't give a specific recommendation for somewhere else. However, I feel pretty safe simply suggesting not here.",

I ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce an old time favorite of mine.  I put in an order for that and one vegetable egg roll.  The eggplant turned has a typical flavor, but some of it was too mushy.  Some of it was the texture that I like and some of the pieces had no form to them at all.  The sauce was adequate.  The vegetable egg roll was pretty standard and nothing interesting.  At least it wasn't stale and hard like sadly quite a few places I have been.  Every Chinese restaraunt has egg rolls, but not very many really have good ones.  I would say that if I was dying for some Chinese food for lunch again at a decent price I would order some take out again.",

The beef teriyaki was typical greasy Chinese food with tons of salt. The service was so lacking. Our waiter pretty much watched TV the whole time.

I have to admit, I was sketched out by the austere vibes of the place and the brusque manner of the staff. Not too friendly, but most certainly efficient. The amazing chicken is advertised as \"lightly battered and fried in our special sauce.\" Well, this is exactly what amazing chicken is -- Its amazing! I got it with fried rice and my plate was literally clean once I was done! My husband was more daring and got the crab Rangoon, lo mein, and Kung Pao chicken. He devoured the entire thing, and shared his lo mein with me. The lo mein was on the slimier side but thats the way we like our lo mein!

In all seriousness, in a highly competitive market where students are demanding quick preparation times, Tong's does an excellent job of balancing quality and preparation time.",

If you attempt to pay with a credit card and your total is under $10, you will be yelled at. If you do not have cash, simply order a second lunch to go and then charge it. 2) Don't expect a fortune cookie. You may get one or you may not. No on knows. 3) Do not order by the number. State the menu item name, no number. 4) Accept that people you thought cared about you really don't and go to Tong's without you.   The end.",

There's a good reason why I've been a loyal customer for the past 5 years.   The Food: You better buckle 2 seatbelts because a surge of flavor is going to blow your beak square off your shoulders. The portion size is enough for even the healthiest of hogs in your crew and that is exactly what the #commonman looks for when faced with a culinary decision. Do not sleep on the starter dishes because a Tong's meal without fried dumplings or crab rangoons (pictured) is like a gym with no weights, you might as well of just kept your lazy self on the couch.   The Service: Oh boy, Mrs Tong's (name uncertain) is a goddess amongst the masses. Her hilariously unapologetic personality keeps you in tip top shape every time you step foot in this establishment. I've been called crazy for what I'm about to say but if that's the case then I don't want to be sane; Mrs. Tong's has made me a better man. Legend says she has not missed a single day in the last 14 years. THAT is the dedication and servitude I crave so dearly.   X FACTOR: Crab Rangoons",

    "text": "YES.  This is the simple, affordable, homestyle Chinese restaurant I've been looking for in Pittsburgh.  This gem can be found in a super unimpressive box of a building in Oakland, which an interior as unadorned as the outside.  My fiance pointed out that half the tables are numbered by marker drawn on the walls.  During our roughly hour and a half there, he was the only Caucasian amongst the 20 or so tables that filtered in and out until another fair-skinned gentleman showed up as we were leaving.  Our Pitt-graduated friends, who used to be regulars but hadn't been there for over a year, were remembered and warmly greeted with a \"long time no see\" in Mandarin by the owner at the door.  To me, these are the type of things that signal a Chinese restaurant's authenticity cred, at least in a small, Chinatown-less city like the 'Burgh.  The four of us each ordered a dish to share family-style, which ended up being the perfect quantity for our table.  We sampled a mix of authentic and Americanized dishes, including the SPARE RIBS WITH POTATO, WATER SPINACH WITH FERMENTED TOFU (comes with choice of being sauteed plainly in the wok or with the fermented tofu), BEEF AND BROCCOLI, and AMAZING CHICKEN.  None of these were dishes that would ever blow my frickin' mind with its novelty, but all were unassuming, decently-prepared, fairly priced, and tasted like home.  The authentic dishes, at least, are the restaurant versions of what our parents make at home.  In particular, the spare ribs suspiciously like how my dad prepares them, although he doesn't slice his potatoes with wavy edges (now a clear oversight in my upbringing).  Porky, tender, amazingness.  I don't often eat meat, but when I do, I want it to be SPARE RIBS, PLEASE.  The water spinach, a must-order for me at any homestyle Chinese place, was a bit overcooked, which prevented it from reaching its wonderfully crunchy potential.  Luckily, I don't mind veggies cooked to death (but give me undercooked and I'll cry), and its wonderfully distinct flavor shined through, enhanced by the fermented tofu sauce.  I wish there had been even more slices of jalapeno tossed in, as I appreciated the heat in an otherwise chili-less meal (a rarity for this incorrigible chili-head).  And a big, heartfelt thanks to Tong's for not slapping a ridiculous $14 price tag on this $2 dish like most Chinese restaurant in town.  (I love you Sichuan/Chengdu/Whatever Gourmet but your prices are laughable.)  The beef broccoli, my go-to Americanized-Chinese order, was perfect in its brown saucy-drenched goodness.  It scratched the itch, hard.  Aaand our Korean friend was responsible for his signature syrup-sauced fried chicken order. :)  But my typically orange chicken-deploring fiance gobbled it up, so I assume it wasn't too terrible.  Our $43-ish dollar bill (also including a pot of hot tea and 2 extra bowls of rice) came out to $45 including tip if we paid cash, an option we most certainly opted for.  Add in its proximity to our home, and I can certainly see us being regulars at Tong's.  It's the perfect option for when I don't feel like cooking, or when I'm craving my dad's cooking, or a weekend brunch like today, orrrr basically any other occasion I can make up.  Yes, I pretty much couldn't believe how satisfied I was with this cheap meal considering how not spicy it was.  I am only disappointed that it took us over a year in Pittsburgh to this bastion of bare-walled happiness.",

They went to the kitchen themselves to make sure I didn't have to wait too long (it took less than 5 minutes for me to get my order).  When I opened my bag (they tied it up in a plastic bag), I realized they gave me a fork, a fortune cookie, and to prevent the plastic bag from getting soggy, they placed a folded menu sheet underneath the contained food.  Now, I realized that they're are two kinds of pad thai: 1) not spicy with lots of peanuts and has bean sprouts with a slice of lemon on the side and 2) spicy with little peanuts and lots of onions, carrots, and lettuce (no bean sprouts or lemon slices).  Sadly (for me), Tong's pad thai is the second one. What was strange in that not only was the container hot but the food itself looked like it was sitting for a bit and the noodles were thin but strangely wide. I had to ditch the fork and get myself some chopsticks to eat it because the noodles kept on breaking.  Like usual, fortune cookies don't disappoint me.",

    "text": "just your typical take-out or dine in Chinese place. I was impressed with how quickly they accommodated new customers and how fast the food came out for a to-go order. yes, I know what you're thinking .... is that a good thing or bad thing? I would say good. The food was very delicious and tasted fresh and didn't give you a feeling of \"what the hell am I eating\". I ordered the chicken with vegetables and steamed rice. really good lunch price and no complaints on the taste! will definitely come back!",
