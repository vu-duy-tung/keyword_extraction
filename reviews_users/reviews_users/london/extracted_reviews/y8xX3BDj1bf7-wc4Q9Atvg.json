The americano was clean and not too acidic. Once you incorporate the design of the cafe and all the fancy packaging, I would probably rate Monocle as one of the best in the city.Seating is a bit cramped and limited, and they don't have wifi (!!!)",

Coffee is solid, if a bit on the expensive side (\u00a33 for a flat white).The room beyond the bar on the ground floor is decorated like somebody's living room. There's a couch, a few seats along the walls, and a big coffee table in the centre. There's also a nice big flatscreen TV mounted in the corner, which is great for people like me who want a little ambient noise while working.The biggest drawback though is the lack of wifi. I don't know if they have plans to install wifi in the future.Cool bathroom with hi-tech Japanese toilet though!",

The green tea chiffon cake was uh-mazing, the lightest fluffiest thing I have ever eaten. I would go back just for this.Maybe I'm being pernickety, but there are a few small things that marred the experience somewhat. The quiet back room seems to have too many sofas for the space, and fairly close proximity and enclosing walls means you can't help but eavesdrop on other people's conversations. That's probably just me being a serial eavesdropper but at least make it difficult for us, jeez. Another small thing, there's no where to put your teabags, so I ended up dumping it in a (very beautiful) glass rather let my tea steep forever. The weirdest thing was the combination of Bloomberg rolling news and Monocle radio. Have one or the other, rather than a weird overlay of chirpy indie music and depressing international news. It added a mildly farcical cacophonous air to a place that would otherwise be relaxing and quiet.",

Staff is simply amazing, friendly, helpful, flexible and cool. The reason I gave it three stars is because the seating plan is extremely uncomfortable, makes you feel like you better eat up and leave. There is no WiFi for customers which seems a bit odd for the style of monocle which is to me all about global identities and style. Perhaps the cafe is too popular amongst residents and this is the only way they have found to contend with cafe trodders who otherwise stick around for hours with their laptops. Who knows? Food is okay. Simple cafe fare. Rather limited but decent options. Would I go back? Perhaps if I'm passing through the neighborhood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.",

But the rest of the food options even though they are nice they are a bit small, which is ok for breakfast but not so great if you are going for lunch.

    "text": "So - finally the Monocle Caf\u00e9 has opened on Chiltern Street, completing a streak of considered branding and well-dressed staff that fully traverses Marylebone, and includes the magazine's offices (Midori House), a shop (George Street), a concession in the Hyatt on Portman Square, and now at long last, the caf\u00e9. For those of us that work in the area, this is welcome relief from Baker Street's chains and Marylebone High Street's lovely but pricey offerings (cf. Providores, La Fromagerie et al).The coffee is sourced from Redchurch Street-Kiwi outfit Allpress, with input on the pastries and baked goods from Lanka's Masayuki Hara and the London outpost of Stockholm's Fabrique bakery. A very strong line-up, then. Although not fully-operational menu-wise (... yet), the macchiato and espresso served was solid - if not quite perfectly pulled by the smart barista - but the macaron I was served on a second visit was La Dur\u00e9e-esque in its moist, flaky goodness. Other offerings, including Japanese chocolate bars ('Crunky'!), rollcake laden with fresh fruit and cream and lovely-looking cinnamon buns were available. In any case, once they've put their full breakfast/lunch (and brunch on weekends) menus in place then this review can be updated and be possibly more than a slightly-informative waste of time.The space itself is light, sleek and very, very 'Monocle'; brushed wood and clean lines lend the caf\u00e9 the requisite Japano-Nordic feel, with seating outside underneath the awning complemented by a more sedate area at the back of the caf\u00e9 with Monocle 24 - the brand's radio station - on constant loop and comfortable minimalist furniture to lounge in and kill your afternoon or chat away to your coffee companion.The lack of significant footfall will likely not detract from this being another very successful Monocle operation - the place is awash with Monocle-ites already, and with hotelier Andr\u00e9 Balazs opening what is looking to be a very swish - and likely very \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 - boutique joint smack-bang opposite later on in 2013, flying trade is assured for the future. In short, go whilst the place is still half-empty and enjoy your Allpress espresso and matcha rollcake whilst being seated is still a realistic proposition.",

So I made my way over to it to realize I wasn't the only one with the same idea. If you don't know, the Monocle Cafe is petite. A small front room where you order, a small back room with some seating and a small downstairs with a few seats. That's about it. So having it high on my agenda of stops to make I had to make do. I ended up sitting by a small window on a stool perhaps designed for Prince George or someone of that size - which if you can imagine a man who is 6'3\" sitting in is sort of hysterical on its own merits. Regardless, I enjoyed my flat white, the Guardian and the soon-to-be-gone Independent as the rain sloshed down around me - happy to have a seat at all as others came and realized they'd not be sitting at all.",

They have the high-tech Japanese toilet that is ready to welcome you with heated seat, music, and variety of automatic flush features. You would wish to stay in their toilet longer if they had more than one. I tried one of them in Japan so I was very happy to find them here. I know it's not coffee-related review but a truly decent and dazzling toilet can make your visit special. Exhibit two is the interior. The place is not that big with only a couple side bars and stools and four tables for two people downstairs. But I liked the semi-private room on the first floor that has a comfortable sofa enough to fit 4 persons, a TV, and coffee tables. Most of the furnitures are very modern, simple, natural and space-savings, similar to what I've seen at Muji, the Japanese retail shop. Monocle magazines are everywhere for you to grab and read since this is the spinoff. In terms of food, monocle has a diverse selection of food from German breakfast to Japanese udon that can suit to whatever cravings you may have. Their small selection of pastries looked all enticing. I enjoyed the green tea cupcake and cinnamon roll accompanied by a hot mocha. The Bircher muesli and selection is toasts looked also very tempting and I have already made plans to visit this place again and try more food. Price is a bit above average. A regular cup of mocha is \u00a33.50 and the cupcake is \u00a33.50. They don't have wi-fi and that's why I didn't see anyone working on a laptop.",

First, the \"food\" couldn't have been drier or more unappealing if it were a feminist's vagina. I won't go into details because I'd vomit at the trauma. The decor must've been inspired by a fast food sushi restaurant at a Scandinavian airport (its namesake publication has fetishes for both). \u00a0The pictures just don't do its sterility justice. A few minutes there will reduce your sperm count and cause you to miss a few menstruation cycles because your eggs will rot. Some cafes are sexy, Monocle Cafe is the antidote to Viagra. The employees are joyless and bewildered why you'd pay to be there. The other patrons are silently crying about what went wrong in their lives. Now then you'll their eyes begging for answers in desperately concealed misery. As for the coffee, well, you're not coming for that. You're there because you're a hermaphrodite in search of a pronoun. But it's terrible. A stain on the third wave coffee movement it pretends to be part of. Oh, please don't bring dogs or any other living innocence there. Not even they could protect you from such high exposures of pretension.",

It is from the London guys who publish Monocle magazine, so a lot of stuff inside is themed accordingly, including playing their own radio in the background! The place is tiny when looking from the outside, but has extra seating downstairs. They also sell all sorts of packages with your coffee - walk a bit past the counter and you will see a sign for magazine + coffee, or coffee + tote or Christmas bundles including a guide book to any of their 15 destinations. Inside I also noticed quite a large menu for food - sandwiches, salads and a few other bites - which I would not think they would serve looking just from the outside. Too bad we already ate! And coffee? Was simply delicious, very milky and sweet :) And each cup comes with a small chocolate",

There are also a selection of sammies, salads, soups, and other small nibbles such as matcha cakes and croissants. Every drink is served on a wooden tray and garnished with a tiny square of wrapped chocolate, a nice little touch. The downstairs seating space has to be the most impressive. It's very comfortable with a lengthy padded bench with tables suitable for studying or working. It does get quite hot downstairs in the afternoon, but offset it with a cold drink. They also recently started offering happy hour drinks around 1730. Staff are very attentive to customers and the space, so it is always very tidy. Green tea leaves a bit to be desired, the flavor profile is slightly off, so perhaps, sticking with the espresso-based drinks or black teas are a better option.",

Advertised as a Japanese caf\u00e9 that also serves Scandinavian breakfasts/pastries (...?), it's essentially just an airy, light space with an equally light yet filling menu. Everything about it is aesthetically pleasing - from the staff, whose shirts match the black and white striped awning outside, to the kitschy wooden plating - and it's a place that clearly takes both its coffee and its customers seriously.I was in the mood for a mocha this morning, and I'm super happy I tried one instead of my usual latte - it was very lightly sweet and had just the right hint of chocolate. I also tried the bircher muesli and, because I couldn't help myself, a chocolate chip cookie. Both were excellent, and I was definitely full after my meal.There is no wifi, which I was a bit worried about at first, but it gave me a great space to catch up on non-line work. I'm mentally bookmarking this as a place to come back to when I want to catch up with friends and put my digital life on hold for a bit.",

Pret, Costa, Paul, Starbucks, Eat, Pret, Pure, Pret, Pret, Pret, Pret -- that's about the bar for Baker Street. If you're looking for an \"indie\" spot to grab your jolt, The Monocle Cafe will hit you where it counts. I'm not much for the whole \"brand\" or \"lifestyle\" of \"Monocle\" (cool if you are though) but they serve very good coffee and that is all I needed them for in this lifetime. The flat white, double espresso and iced americano x 20 powered me through many an afternoon. Anytime someone queried at the office \"where can I actually get good coffee?\" they were immediately sent here without hesitation with a warning on the price tag. Yes, it's overpriced. The coffee is great but it is expensive. \u00a34 for an iced americano!? It is mostly water chappies! Oh well, clearly I sacrificed the coin to get the goods. Just be prepared for the sticker shock on some of the items. *not worker bee friendly (no wifi) -- not encouraged. *a few outside tables will allow you to people watch the who's who of London trotting in and out of Chiltern Firehouse. *there is more seating downstairs. *small Japanese cafe menu on offer (I've never tried) If you are reading this, you need coffee (good coffee) in the sea of dreaded chain coffeeland, here's your solve. You're welcome. Buzzzzzz.",

The small room on the ground floor with couches where you sit with strangers was also quite fun. I tried the iced matcha latte, and loved how it wasn't sweet! Friends also say the (Japanese) food here is good too!",

The location is super cosy and quiet,and the food was delicious. A real taste of Japan in London for 8\u00a3.The shop is quite small so seated places are limited, but if you go there on a week morning, the place is pretty empty (we got the back room with sofa and armchair for ourselves).",

The staff even got into the whole look and feel of the place. Coffee is pretty good, tea is even better and you can get matcha lattes here: yum.If you are into pastries go no further than the cinnamon scrolls. They are zesty, cardamom, sticky amazingness. The Swedish and the Japanese breakfasts are beautiful and light, but substantial making them a nice healthy start to the day. Biggest highlight of all: the heated toilet seat. Wow.",

    "text": "Tucked away opposite on the Chiltern Firehouse, off of Baker street, this place is a real gem. It's what you'd want a quiet cafe to be--secluded, with friendly staff, lovely food, and baked goods. The best thing on the menu, undoubtedly, is the cardamom bun--a lesser known cousin of the now famous cinnamon bun. It was so good that I got one, took a bite when I left the shop, and then went right back in to get another one because my wife and I knew that our love wasn't strong enough to withstand sharing this piece of heaven.They have some unusual flavors in macaroons. My favorite would definitely be the black sesame and matcha.They have cakes from Lanka which I intend to go back for--especially the matcha variety. Expect me again soon, Monocle.",
