Found this place online before I left home and told myself I will have to come here at least once during my stay in London. The breakfast was tasty and healthy! I got skinny Benedict and oh boy, so glad that I could have similar breakfast to what I cook by myself everyday back home. (Okay, I'm not bragging about my cooking skill just FYI. :) ) it just sucked that it rained so hard this morning so when I arrived here, i was almost soaked. (And completely soaked when I walked back to the tube). But definitely worth the trip! :D",

    "text": "I honestly travel far and wide for a meal from The Good Life Eatery. For REAL food you can look no further. There is something for everyone, for whatever diet you're on, even if you're not on a diet, if you want to eat well and have non-healthy friends, this place is just MAGIC full stop.Fast service, lovely staff and a banging menu. I spend the majority of time trying to decide what to eat, promise myself I'll work through the menu, but end up ordering the same things cause it's just so damn good.My current favorites are The Good Life Salad - perfect for those with a sweet tooth. It's the only time I've actually really loved chowing down on kale. I also love their Raw Pad Thai and their Goodness Bowl which is a bit of everything. And all their brunches! AND THE BROWNIES . My cousin hates all this 'healthy' stuff and had one of their chia puddings I had brought home and said he'd never had something like that so good. They may be a little pricey but their portion sizes are HUGE. I also feel happy that I know they cook the food in good oils, there are no hidden nasties in the meals and sauces and genuinely makes me feel all good inside (I know I know.. But just wait Til you try it). Also, everyone who eats here is GORGEOUS so if that doesn't tell you something I don't know what will. The only negative would be the extremely small space, so if you're coming for lunch I'd try and miss prime hours (no reservations) - but it's a great place to come with a girlfriend to catch up over some yummy food! Hoping for more locations so I don't have to travel too far for a delicious meal!",

I get the impression that it tries to \"wow\" you with its creative ideas and fancy presentation, but in the end, the food is lacking. Being in Chelsea, I expected it to be expensive, but 6 pounds for a small, mediocre health shake was still upsetting.The food here is healthy, as the name of the restaurant would imply, and in that regard, it's quite respectable. However, to charge a tenner for a bland waffle and some yogurt on the side is high-way robbery. Eating healthy doesn't always need to cost so much.The hype for this place through social media built up high expectations for me, but it fell somewhat flat for me.One of the more disappointing food experiences I have had in London.",

The noodles were so yummy it you hardly notice that they are vegetables and not pasta! As far as the smoothies go, the Choc Norris is amazing!!! I highly recommend getting it. And the green smoothie called Ninja Turtle is alright, but without any fruit it's kind of bland. I've also had the acai bowl but it's not the best, and the desserts looked great too! The space is quite small, so you have to check for a table or sit at the bar next to the wall. And wifi would be a nice addition too!",

    "text": "Review from Yana & Beca from SeeknPlay.coWhat better way to remedy a Saturday night hangover than a Sunday morning brunch trip?The Good Life Eatery was the best place to re-nourish our bodies after a few too many large glasses of wine and to clear our conscience too. The night ended with a little trip to a chicken shop... begins with K and ends with C. Oops!Healthy eating joints are popping up all over London as the health and wellness industry continues to boom. The girls behind The Good Life Eatery are taking full advantage of this #cleaneating craze and who can blame them. Yasmine and Shirin only founded The Good Life Eatery 3 years ago, the same number of restaurants they now own. This speaks passion and entrepreneurial drive. We have no doubt that more of their healthy havens will be popping up all over London.The Eatery is so popular, the long queue of people standing outside proves this, but keep an eye out or you'll walk straight past it. The cafe is welcoming and unpretentious, but fits nicely into its surroundings of the sophisticated SW3 area. \u00a0The window is full of yummy looking treats (mostly gluten free) spoiling you for choice. However, The Good Life Eatery (Sloane Avenue, Chelsea) is quite small, so be prepared to wait for a table if you're planning to eat in.Looking at the menu, you are totally spoilt for choice. We found ourselves scanning the big black boards over and over trying to decide what delicious delights to choose. Dishes are diverse and range from protein-rich smoothies, baked goods, sandwiches and superfood salads. Like two little girls in a sweet shop, we waited eagerly for our food to arrive. The time was filled sipping on our smoothie and juice drinks. Both tasted rather heavenly.Yana liberated her sweet tooth and went for the Almond and Chestnut Waffles, with Banana Mash and Chia Jam. To drink, the Choc Norris, with Raw Cacao, Almond Butter, Avocado, Banana and Almond Milk, was an obvious choice. They went down an absolute treat, in 60 seconds to be precise!After much umming and arring, Beca finally decided on the Rise and Shine granola bowl with; Chia Seed Pudding, Home-made Granola, Almond-Hazelnut Butter, Strawberry, Banana and Cranberry Powder (gluten free and dairy free). If that wasn't enough the Spelt and Quinoa Scone was thrown in there and to wash it down, a Dr Green Love juice, with Spinach, Kale, Green Apple and Coconut.Beca's thoughts: Rise and Shine was well presented and pleasing to the eye. I thoroughly enjoyed the top layer with the variety of flavours but felt a little disappointed to discover that the chia pudding dominated the bowl. Definitely not enough granola or fruit given. Being a massive scone lover I had to try The Good Eatery's Spelt and Quinoa recipe... bellissimo! Will be having that again. The chef definitely doesn't scrimp on the portion sizes, but don't worry about leaving the goodness behind. Just ask for a doggy bag! You might find the bill a little pricey, especially if you are just grabbing a quick bite to eat. We managed to spend around \u00a313 each. The smoothies ring in at \u00a36 a pop, but bearing in mind the location and quality of food, we let it slide.In all, we had a splendid experience at The Good Life Eatery, teaching us that there are better ways to remedy a hangover than a greasy spoon cafe! After all the food and smoothie/juices consumed we were still able to fit in a Peanut Butter Cupcake each. These little gems are rich and satisfying, and a must try if you fancy visiting The Good Life Eatery. We shall be returning!If you've been let us know your thoughts.",

    "text": "Good coffee... but unable to get a seat to have anything else.My hubby & I were shopping King St yesterday when we realised we hadn't had lunch and it was 3pm! \u00a0Having wanted to try out Good life eatery (mainly based on the many celebrity endorsements) for some time now, and figuring that by 3pm it might have quietened down by then, we got a quick uber over. We found a little line (about ten people ahead of us) but decided to wait it out. Firstly, the menu isn't entirely palatable to the lay man (everything is kale-something or superfood-somethingelse) but we decided to persevere and order coffees, juices and some basic grilled chicken and avocado on toast (though we nearly ordered the quinoa falafel as well). \u00a0By the time we got to the till we'd already waited about 20 mins. While my hubby paid, I asked a waitress about the seating situation. She kind of brushed me off and infered that it was every man for himself. I eyed a table that had two girls that looked like they were finishing up. After about ten mins of watching and waiting, they left and I went in for the kill, but the rude people next to that table decided to spread out across the two tables. By that point, I was over it (we'd been waiting half an hour, including queue time) so we cancelled our food order and got our coffees to go. The coffees were good, \u00a0like really good. We'd ordered iced lattes. They were strong but smooth and if I'm honest I'd queue up 15 mins for them again. Having said that I would NEVER go here in an attempt to get a table again. I find it quite annoying when cafes have tables but no table service.",

The menu ranges from everything from eggs benedict to granola bowls, acai bowls and salads. While I love everything about the menu, I can't rave about this place for a few reasons. There are no where near enough seats. There is always a line out the door of people wanting a table and once they've ordered they stand there and eyeball you if you're at a table making you feel rushed and making it hard to enjoy your meal. If you manage to get a table before you order, you're also glared at for sitting at a table before you've ordered while the other person you're with goes to the back of the long line to order. When you get to the front of the line, staff on the cashiers are incredibly slow and don't seem to manage to get your correct order down... a little frustrating. The eggs benedict was tiny - one small piece of bread with two eggs.....and it was cold. The granola bowl was essentially a bowl of granola, with a few berries and a spoon of yogurt which definitely wasn't enough for the whole bowl.. I had the chocolate norris smoothie, which was nice but the avocado flavour seemed to be too prominent in this instance. I'm sure they're better when they're not rushed off their feet but I was really looking forward to checking this place out and I just felt harassed and rushed and then a little let down..... I'm not sure I'd be back in a hurry which is a shame as there is other items on their menu I'd have liked to try!",

They have delicious Breakfast & Lunch items. Coffees, Teas, Smoothies, pastries etc. I'd recommend the Goodness bowl. It had a little mix of everything from tomato chickpeas, falafel balls, a variety of spiraled veggies (which I think change depending on the season).There was even a half of a whole avocado that was dipped in black sesame, sunflower & pumpkin seeds. All Served with fresh salsa. Just a really satisfying dish, and all very fresh. If I hadn't change my location in London, I definitely would have eaten here quite a few times.",

It was delicious but also so huge that I couldn't finish it. It came with tomato chickpeas (my favorite part), avocado, quinoa falafels, pea/kale dip, and some salsa (I didn't like the salsa). Overall, the dish was really good, healthy, and high quality. I'm definitely going to head back here soon.",

I stopped by for breakfast on a Monday morning, and was able to easily get a table. The menu has a lot of great and varied options, and I finally decided on the Bel Air. Awesome. Fantastic. Tasty. Cooked right. Nothing annoys me more than poorly done Poached Eggs, and so when they arrived cooked to perfection I was already sold. The fritter was extremely tasty (not the sort of thing I'd ordinarily choose) and upon completion of the meal my taste buds and belly were fully satiated. The best thing - the coffee didn't disappoint!! Right temperature and right flavour! This was a great find.",

They were blooming massive! We went for the feta and tomato courgetti and the hot chicken with refried beans and rice. We also ordered a delicious coconut milk based smoothie with berries. The hot food arrived still hot (something I have had issues with in recent deliveries) and the portions really were so big we were able to both have it for lunch the next day. Highlights definitely include the smoothie and the hot dish - the chicken was so moist and the rice and beans full of flavour. The courgetti was also really good but got a bit samey quite quickly. There are tonnes more scrummy sounding salads as well as a brunch menu which looks fab - will definitely be either visiting or ordering from them again soon.",

    "text": "This place is way too hyped up on Instagram.The food was good but I experienced serious food/meal envy with my girlfriend. I ordered The Lean Machine bowl with sweet potato falafel and the Ninja Turtle (veggie/green) smoothie. I was slightly disappointed with both. The bowl was okay but nothing in comparison with the teriyaki salmon Man Bowl. The smoothly wasn't great (even though it's supposedly a favourite). It tasted of water and cucumber, only much thicker and I didn't finish it. The Berry Sunrise was decent though and I would consider getting it again (even though it was \u00a36 per smoothly)! By the way, don't be put off by the name \"Man Bowl\"... a woman can eat this easy and it's worth getting.The restaurant looked nice - it has a rustic, healthy, modern twist going for it. The downside is that it's way too small and busy. We did go on a Saturday so it might be worth trying on a weekday instead. There were no tables available when we arrive so we sat at a bar overlooking the stairs to the bathroom. Also, we felt way to close to everyone to properly enjoy the meal and left the restaurant feeling slightly overwhelmed. I honestly think the restaurant could be massively improved if they remove the bars and let fewer customers eat in at a time.The service was also quite strange. We were given two options as to how we could wait for a table. We ended up sitting at a bar to eat until a table was made available. Even when a table was freed up, we decided not to move because you could tell everyone was waiting for a table (there were a lot of people waiting) and we didn't want to race to it. It would be nice if the staff organised this.",

It's a very health-food oriented place, with plenty of options for veggies and meat-eaters alike. The till is almost overwhelming with the amount of treats and juices there are to choose from (and then there's the actual menu), but the back is a calm space with plenty of two-person seating.For breakfast, I tried the a\u00e7ai bowl and one of their mylk drinks. The a\u00e7ai was nice, and topped with plenty of fruits and granola. I wasn't so much a fan of the mylk, but I think that was more of a texture thing than anything else. When I came back for lunch, I ordered their daily soup (cauliflower - amazing!) and a slice of avo toast, which was nothing special in comparison. I also tried the green juice and a sip of my boyfriend's coconut water, which was exquisitely fresh because of the literal slice of coconut in the bottle. He also ordered a Man Bowl (of course) and ate all of it before I could try any, so that's a ringing endorsement.All of that being said, the conclusion I've drawn from my experiences at The Good Life Eatery is that in order to enjoy said good life, you've gotta be willing to pay the price. Which is hella expensive.",

I got the GOODNESS BOWL: \u00a0hollywood tabbouleh, zucchini fettucine, sweet potato, quinoa, falafel, black bean dip, gluten free crackers, \u00a01/2 avocado with omega seeds, red pepper chilli sauce GF for \u00a312.50; the THE GOOD LIFE SALAD with kale, roasted sweet potato, quinoa, lentils, walnut, goji berries, nutritional yeast and orange tahini vinaigrette GF V for \u00a311.00; the BAKED SWEET POTATO & QUINOA FALAFEL GF DF with basil cashew cream GF Vfor \u00a34.50; the PEANUT BUTTER CUPS (Organic Peanut Butter, Spelt, Cocoa, Non-Hydrogenated Sunflower Spread (3 Pieces) for \u00a33.75; and last but not least an energy ball. Leftovers for days!I thought the Goodness Bowl was the better of the two salads as the sweet potato mash is delicious: incredibly creamy with roasted overtones. The avocado was perfectly creamy with the omega seeds a nice crunchy addition and the sauce tangy and tasty. However, I seemed to be missing the black bean dip =/. The portion though large, far more so than the Good Life salad. The Good Life salad had great nuggets of sweet potato but the kale was dry. I did ask for dressing on the side though so it's likely my fault. I assumed though the kale would be massaged to break up the plant's naturally tough fibers. The dressing was marvelous though.The falafel was crunchy but I admit I didn't taste sweet potato very much. Sadly, I didn't get the basil cashew cream that was supposed to accompany it. The PB cup was definitely \"healthy\" tasting; don't be fooled you'e getting a Reese's. But I love anything PB so was up my alley. It has a crumbly texture.I'm dinking a star just because of the missing sauce and the fact it's so expensive!!",

I originally found out about them through Ella Woodward \"Deliciously Ella\" where she recommends good health places to dine at. Plus God was pointing at it too and also I recently borrowed \"The Good Life Eatery Cookbook\" so that was the final push for me. I had to attend. Upon arrival the cakes were displayed in the window and my eyes were drawn to the Red velvet cake. God knows I love me some Red velvet ever since Hummingbird bakery introduced London to its deliciousness. So I ordered at the counter my Red velvet slice for \u00a34 made only with Gluten free ingredients and also Dairy free. I also ordered a Matcha Latte which you can choose what milk you want at no extra cost. I chose Almond milk. The cake \u00a0was perfectly moist with light cream cheese which I felt you could tell the different from the normal one. Unfornately I would of loved if they had used alternative sweeteners instead of caster sugar. The Matcha Latte was nice and light especially great on a humid day. It is a small place with know downstairs beside the toilet, kitchen and office. \u00a0I came on a late Sunday afternoon on the hottest day of the year so far and it was a chilled out vibe. Absolutely love the decor, topical plant, overhead fan, barstools, lovely chest nutty brown furniture. I like the fact their was a jug of water and a few magazines including their cookbook for your leisure. \u00a0They don't have free WIFi because they would prefer that people speak to each other or just be! Which I think is great it nice to be mindful and enjoy the simple thing in life like the pleasure of eating great food. I'm sooooo coming back to try their food, which look A-MA-ZING!!",
