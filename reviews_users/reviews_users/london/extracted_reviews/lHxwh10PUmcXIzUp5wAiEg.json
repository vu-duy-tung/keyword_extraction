    "text": "Last night Alan and I celebrated our 32nd wedding anniversary here. \u00a0It's about a 10 minute walk (shorter if you're a fast walker) from our hotel and has been open a couple of months, I think. \u00a0It's a branch of a small chain of steakhouses in London. \u00a0You walk up a couple of steps and down a long flight of stairs to the host station. \u00a0Our hotel concierge had switched our reservation from one of the other branches to this one at our request, since it involved a walk rather than a taxi ride. \u00a0We were greeted and amid a little confusion over our reservation (Were we a party of 7? \u00a0No, it's our anniversary, it's just the two of us.) our hostess confided that she had just celebrated her first wedding anniversary. \u00a0She escorted us down a shorter flight of stairs to a table for two.The restaurant has high, white curved ceilings. \u00a0Several tables were filled w/ parties of varying sizes and as the evening progressed the restaurant filled up. \u00a0The noise level was high, but not unpleasantly so. \u00a0We looked at the menus and I looked at the cocktail menu, then the wine list. \u00a0We both decided to have 400 gram ribeyes, mine rare and Alan's medium rare, w/ no additional salt. \u00a0As I looked through the sides I saw the expected creamed spinach, then following it, spinach w/ garlic and lemon, which sounded perfect. \u00a0With the guidance of our waiter we decided in addition to share the heirloom tomato salad and the triple cooked chips, unsalted. \u00a0Shortly after ordering, another man, seemingly a manager, but who also worked as a waiter, came over, wished us a happy anniversary and asked us about wine. \u00a0Alan \u00a0explained he had to stick w/ water because of \u00a0the limitations of his liquid intake. \u00a0I was interested in a glass of wine, so the sommelier was sent over. \u00a0He was young, bearded w/ long hair and a plaid shirt w/ the sleeves rolled up. \u00a0He was adorable, the antithesis of the old school pretentious, imposing sommelier. \u00a0I told him the style of wines I like and he made a few suggestions. \u00a0Two were available by the glass and he offered me small tastes of each, a Cabernet and a Malbec. \u00a0They were both delicious, the Cabernet a little smoky, both smooth. \u00a0I decided on the Malbec because it seemed to open up more over time and he brought me a glass. \u00a0I suggested to Alan he ask about the tiniest glass of beer they offered so he could have just a taste. \u00a0It's been months since he'd had one. \u00a0He spoke w/ the manager/waiter, whose name we didn't hear. \u00a0Unfortunately they don't have beers on tap, just in the bottle, but he suggested getting a bottle and drinking just a small amount, which is what Alan did.Our steaks were delivered,along w/ the sides. \u00a0The meat was delicious and the spinach was wonderful,much like what I make at home, but the addition of the lemon was new and lovely. \u00a0The heirloom tomatoes in the salad weren't as vibrant as I'd hoped they would be, but the combination of the tomatoes, tiny dices of cucumbers and thin slices of red onion w/ the lightly piquant vinaigrette was flavorful. \u00a0The chips were delicious and crispy. \u00a0Alan requested some catsup for them. \u00a0After dinner our manager/waiter came over and encouraged us toward dessert. \u00a0When I said that Alan didn't eat sweets, he suggested a cheese plate, which sounded \u00a0good. \u00a0We are quite susceptible to temptation. \u00a0There \u00a0were three cheeses, one a blue, one a sheep's milk and I forget the third, along w/ two types of crackers and some chutney. \u00a0After we'd finished the cheeses the sommelier came by w/ a plate on whose rim was written in chocolate, 'Happy Anniversary' w/ three artisan chocolates in the center. \u00a0It was surprising and most welcome! \u00a0Since Alan doesn't eat chocolates, they were all mine. \u00a0One was salted caramel, one was passionfruit and the third was bourbon based. \u00a0They were each lovely in their own way, although I think the passionfruit sang to me most sweetly.When the bill was presented our drinks had been comped and the price of the cheese plate had been reduced. \u00a0Everyone we came in contact w/ at the restaurant had been kind and friendly. \u00a0We felt royally treated and if we lived locally we would be regulars.",

Its very cool inside and is great for crowds or couples. \u00a0We checked in our jackets and were led to our table. They have a great selection of wines and the menu is based on steaks and seafood. The prices were very reasonable for London and how high class the restaurant is. I ordered oysters which were lovely and the steak tartare which was good too. Everyone else ordered the fillet steaks and most people said it was the best steak they have had in a long time..if not ever. \u00a0The sides were all good however on the small side. \u00a0One ordered a panna cotta which they loved and I ordered a espresso martini which was delicious. \u00a0The birthday boy got some free chocolates and a 'happy birthday' written on his plate. \u00a0Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a reasonably priced special occasion.",

    "text": "Sorry amigos, this is a long one. Hawksmoor has proven, at least to my partner and me, to be as good as it gets for dining and service in London, and the new Knightsbridge branch continues to hold up that reputation. I don't generally eat meat, but have been so happy with the other offerings at Hawksmoor that I jumped to make a reservation for my birthday at the Knightsbridge location when I read that it would have a wider seafood selection. The complimentary round of champagne for July and August also helped, I must say!We were running late for our reservation, but when we got in touch to let them know about it, they were still so gracious and allowed us to decompress at the bar after we had rushed to get there, even though they were quite booked. The bar experience at Hawksmoor is one I always look forward to, because of the sophisticated, clubby atmosphere that also manages to feel laid-back and relaxed. The cocktails are superb (their negronis are my favourites!) and they have a nice selection of craft beers. I can't comment on the wine, because I'm usually buried too deep in the cocktail menu. We started with oysters, which were wonderful - briny, plump and so fresh, served with a mignonette. We also shared an herb salad with dinner.I got the scallops on the half-shell and half a lobster. My eyes were bigger than my stomach, but I ate everything and I regret nothing.The scallops were covered in crisp breadcrumbs and a garlicky butter sauce. They were rich, but wow. WOOOW. The scallops were sweet and large and the whole dish definitely felt like an indulgence, but a very nice one, The lobster was perfectly cooked, with large pieces of meat. I must have looked like an animal whilst eating it, but again, je ne regrette rien.My partner got a rib-eye steak, cooked medium-rare at the recommendation of the waiter, and lobster mac & cheese. So, you know how I said I almost never eat eat meat? I eat it at Hawksmoor, maybe once or twice a year, albeit in small bites stolen from the husband's plate after his eyes start rolling back in his head from over-consumption. Their steak is a revelation. It is a Come-to-Jesus experience for me. It's so tender, you can cut it with the side of your fork, and the outside has just the right amount of char, while the centre is like meaty buttah. \u00a0We washed it down with a Plymouth gin martini, which was just right after pillaging that meal.Finally, we had the 'Ferrero Rocher' for dessert, which was basically a chocolate sphere the size of a tennis ball, with a chocolate ganache centre and hazelnut mousse. That description doesn't do it justice. It was wonderful, and I vowed to come back the next time I have a bad day, simply to eat that, have a drink and get back on the train back to Brighton.A note on the service: Our waiter was charming and attentive, and we were checked on often by him, and other staff. The bartenders are always friendly, and the front of house staff are equally friendly and polite. It sure feels nice to go somewhere and feel assured that you will be treated well, and have a wonderful meal.",

You are looking at paying a similar price for less than average steak chains elsewhere in London such as Angus Steakhouse so Hawksmoor's express lunch deal was indeed great value for money, service as expected was also very friendly and well mannered, I got nothing but love for Hawksmoor.",

    "text": "One of the best steakhouses in London has arrived in Knightsbridge. If you like meat, Hawksmoor Knightsbridge is a place you should have on your map!It was unplanned - on my commute home, my phone suddenly alerted me that something was wrong with the District line. Not that surprising, really - but this time, there was a part closure. Worse, the part of the line I needed was closed, so I decided to stay on the train and get off at South Kensington, to have some light bites outside. \u00a0Disappointed after the failed attempts to get a place outside without waiting, I was already at the bus stop to make my way home, when I remembered that Hawksmoor opened a new branch in Knightsbridge recently. I looked it up and as it was not too far away, decided to give it a go, to salvage my Friday evening after a busy week. Hawksmoor Knightsbridge is located in a little side street and probably easy to miss if you do not know what to look for. Once you enter, you are in a beautiful, elegant space dominated by dark wood, brass lamps and light green leather. At the reception, I was asked for my name - wrongly, I assumed they wanted my first name and spelled it. And I was corrected. Yes, of course the \"oe\" should be an \"\u00f6\", but I had given up long ago spelling my name with \"\u00f6\" in London. However, the woman at the reception was German and when I confirmed the umlaut in my name, she immediately recognised that I was also German. Sometimes you get the impression that London is quite small, and full of Germans.After I made my way down to the table, I was offered a complimentary glass of champagne, because it is summer. That's what I would call a great start! \u00a0After a quick look at the wine list, the lovely waitress - another export from the continent, though not from Germany but neighbouring Poland - asked if I had any questions. If so, she could get the sommelier over to me. I always like to get recommendations from people who know about wine, and soon after the sommelier talked me through the list. I asked for something light, either white or red. He suggested a few options, dashed off, and then came back with three tasters. Really excellent service. I decided to order the one he mentioned right at the beginning, an unusual Grenache (Birichino, Old Vine Grenache 2012 - Santa Cruz, California) with a distinct taste. A good choice and a really delicious, light, red. Too light for many other people, I guess, but right for me.I was slightly disappointed that they do not bring complimentary bread and butter, but then I did not have to wait too long before my juicy, medium-rare grilled fillet steak arrived. It was a bit on the rare side, I would say, and tasted very good. The peppercorn sauce had a strong and lovely peppery flavour, I just would have liked to see more peppercorns in it - again, that's just a personal preference, and as it was full of pepper flavour, I did not really mind. When the friendly German descended from the reception and wandered around the dining hall, she stopped by and we briefly chatted about London and their meat - I did not know, or remember, that Hawksmoor sources its steaks exclusively from Ginger Pig. Good \u00a0to know, Ginger Pig now seems to supply plenty upmarket places with their quality produce.As side, I had chosen the safe option, triple-cooked chips. They were golden and crunchy, just as I like them. They had nothing special to them, nothing that makes them stand out, they are simply very good chips. When I added some salt and pepper from the little mills on the table, I found the chips even more enjoyable.After destroying the beautiful steak, I went on to get a delightlingly decadent dessert dish - they call it their take on \"Ferrero Rocher\" and it is a gold-plated chococlate heaven. Many different textures and flavours, creamy and crunchy, and simply one of the nicest chocolate desserts anyone could imagine. Once again, an excellent recommendation, this time by the helpful and attentive waitress. When I ordered the dessert, she had explained to me that they serve Climpson & Sons coffee, so I had decided to get one. You think that when they source coffee from a nice roastery, they should also serve a decent cup. And they did, the flat white was indeed better than the coffee you mostly get at restaurants. Often I regret ordering a coffee even at outstanding restaurants - not here.I was at Hawksmoor before and I liked it. However, this time the steak was even better than at my last visit some years ago. As you expect in Knightsbridge, it all comes with a certain price tag. Really, at this level I kind of expect to get some nice bread to start with; perhaps that's out of fashion now, and maybe I eat too much bread anyway...That takes nothing away from the absolutely delightful fillet steak, peppercorn sauce, wine and service.",

He apologized and brought a napkin and club soda but offered to only cover our round of drinks and my cleaning bill for the clothes. Well, given that I had a non-alcoholic drink, that didn't benefit me very much. Plus, I was flying out the next morning so there was no chance of having any laundry done before then for them to cover. When I pointed this out, he didn't offer to do anything else.

Hardly fully booked.I should have listened to my friends review that it wasn't great but I didn't listen.No soul or vibe to the restaurant but fine, it sometimes is the case.Ordered the wine, guy found it tough to pour, dripped on the table and my water despite the cloth around the bottle neck. It's not that hard. Then the wait, so long for the food to come.Food arrives, slowly the guy puts the food on the table. 850 grams of steak, fries and bone marrow. The steak wasn't that 850g. insulting to charge what they did for 11 small pieces of steak. Literally the size of a t bone steak for 1 in any other restaurant. Needless to say we finished, feeling hungry, half a bottle of wine left, certainly a first, the meal was fast.The little service that there was, was poor to say the least. Not sure if they don't care or they are not trained but it was a waste of time.Left unsatisfied, quite insulted that the daylight robbery had occurred. I pay for good quality but what this was, was a joke. I'm sure the pub on the corner makes better food.London needs a steakhouse but this certainly isn't it.Don't waste your time or money.",

    "text": "We came for Sunday roast, and it was everything we hoped it would be. We started by sharing a Doddington Caesar salad. It comes as it should with anchovies but if you're not a fan I'm sure they'll keep them off if you ask. They're also easy enough to pick off. The roast (cooked medium or well done) comes with potatoes, greens, carrots, and Yorkshire pudding. \u00a0The gravy is yummy with beefy bits in it. We had a Malbec with our meal - it was fruity on the front and spicy on the back and went really well with the roast. Our server told us that the reds they have available are selected to go with beef (which makes sense haha) so you can pick any red on the list that is your preference. For dessert we ordered sticky toffee pudding (heavenly), Ambassador's Reception (inspired by Ferrero Rocher candies - yummy but really sweet), and blueberry cream (creamy, sweet, and tart). With our desserts we had the Full Fat Old Fashioned, made with bourbon infused with butter. That's right, butter. They also add sugar and ice, and trust me when I say if you like bourbon, whiskey, or scotch, you will appreciate the richness and smooth flavors of this treasure of a drink. Trust me - order one. You can thank me later.The service was also good. Our server Mario was friendly and happy to answer questions.",

    "text": "It's my second time in London in two years and my second visit to a Hawksmoor restaurant. During my last visit in 2014, I was obsessed with the the idea of Sunday Roast and did a lot of research on restaurants in London with the best Sunday Roast. Hawksmoor Seven Dials was the choice then. My husband I had a dinner time reservation and the beef roast had run out before we ate (on this trip I noticed the menu said it was only guaranteed until 5 PM). We were disappointed and contemplating leaving until the waitress convinced us that the roast chicken with all the traditional trimmings would be a good substitute. It was (!!), hence my eagerness to return to a Hawksmoor this trip.This time I was on my own and I made a late lunch reservation to ensure that there would still be beef. All aspects of the meal were enjoyable. The waiter didn't scoff when I ordered a medium to medium-well piece of meat (I'm pregnant...usually I want it bloody). Veggies (especially the carrots), Yorkshire pudding, crispy roast potatoes, gravy, and horseradish sauce were all simply and perfectly prepared.I thankfully left some food on my plate so that I'd have room for dessert. The Hawksmoor's Sticky toffee pudding was one of the best desserts I've ever had. I'm not an aficionado on this particular cake, but I don't think that matters much. Trust me, it's freaking good. The cake was generously soaked in stunning toffee sauce and the super super smooth custard on top left was divine, not just an afterthought. Lay off me, I'm pregnant.The restaurant itself is a pleasant place to eat. It smells of wood fire and whisky when you walk in (mmmmm). The decor is straightforward with a subdued mid-century modern feel. Very appropriate for a hip steakhouse.",

    "text": "Honestly, I wasn't impressed with Hawksmoor. The food was subpar for the most part and it wasn't worth it at all. I had an early dinner without a reservation and got seated immediately. The ambience of the restaurant is very nice and slightly casual. For appetizers, I got the mixed oysters. I would like to say that I'm relatively familiar with oysters... But these all tastes the same to me, so I questioned whether they were in fact mixed. It was fresh, but I wasn't a big fan of them. I also got the tuna tartare, which was probably the best dish all night. It was delicious and the portion was generous. I had the ribeye for my main. I guess presentation isn't really a big thing for their steak...because it's literally just a piece of steak on the dish with nothing else. I ordered it medium rare but it came out rare. I didn't think it was savory either, just a piece of meat. Other things to note.. The Mac and cheese was delicious. The drinks were good, I enjoyed my Concealed Weapon. The service was very good. The server checked up on us pretty often. The wait for the food was average. Overall, an overpriced dinner for a meal that wasn't event close to wowing me.",

Good start!The restaurant is beautiful and reminds me of a 20s fancy steakhouse. Food was out of this world. We got bone marrow which is incredibly rich and intense and probably my favourite thing on the menu. We also go spinach and Mac and cheese (both classics) and you could literally have a great satisfying meal with just those too and the bone marrow, let alone the steak. I got a porterhouse steak and you choose them from a blackboard with their respective weights. After ordered the cross it out as you've taken their only Xoz steak of that particular cut and its refreshing to know they don't just have hundreds of steaks in the kitchen. Steak was amazing. It's very easy to order too much so be careful! Definitely recommend for a special night out.",

The drinks at the bar were very good, we then got our table at the back of the restaurant and since we like to eat a bit earlier than the rest of London, we had no other guests around for the longest time. We shared the chateaubriand and had fries, spinach and the tomato salad as sides, she had the hollandaise and I had bearnaise and omg was the meat tasty and cooked to perfection (medium rare). The waitress suggested a wine based on our order as my initial suggestion would have had too much flavor for the chateaubriand and suggested a slightly cheaper and less strong wine which my gf, who isn't too much into reds, enjoyed.The ambassadors reception is a must try (if you, like me, enjoy ferror rocher) for dessert!

Raw oyster combo is excellent; I forget the names but two out of the three kinds were quite good, third was a little too briny. Raw seabass appetizer was delicate yet substantial.Mashed potatoes and gravy looked small but was quite ample in reality, and the caesar salad was artful, yet definitely not subtle (literally, whole baby romaine leaves covered in cheese and with an anchovy). And the ribeye was excellent-- rare to perfection, marbling to match, a little sea salt, simply superb.Desserts were very good, the lemon meringue sundae was the right balance of sweet ice cream and vanilla chips (?) yet sour with lemon zest. Went very well with the Glenronach 18 Allardice.Overall, quite good, even the basement architecture compliments the meal and adds a lot of atmosphere. Not cheap, but then, a good steak out rarely is.",

    "text": "Without fail my go-to steak restaurant in London.The purest Hawksmoor out of the bunch in my opinion, the ambiance is perfect under the vaulted ceiling. The staff are brilliant in their informal, knowledgeable, attentive yet unobtrusive manner but the highlight is the attention to detail that marks Hawksmoor above the rest. You could also say, Hawksmoor Knightsbridge over the rest of the bunch.Being a creature of habit and also living by the \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" my usual dinner for two.Start with the mixed Oysters, shucked well and served on ice with the usual accoutrements and of a really good size.The main event of course we're out usual two perfectly hand cut fillets. Done rare they melt in the mouth with no toughness to be found anywhere. I would be happy with just the steak but of course Te sauces and sides add to the experience. The triple cooked chips are crispy, fluffy in the middle and exactly what you expect. The wilted spinach is just that, not a load of mush just wilted with flavours of garlic. The massive baked sweet potato has hints of spice and is mashed to perfection. Then there are the sauces: as a traditionalist the peppercorn tastes fresh and is evidently not sat there brewing away however the Stilton Hollandaise is naughty. REALLY NAUGHTY. I'm sure it's a gateway drug as its creamy, cheesiness is not only perfect with the steak but is even better as a decadent dip for your chips.If you still have room for more the desserts render me speechless. The fruit pie is amazing especially when lavished with the jug of fresh custard *starts salivating again* and I am assured that both the hand made \"Rolos\" and sticky toffee pudding seal the deal and put you in a post-dinner nirvana of satisfaction.I won't review the cocktails otherwise this will end up in War and Peace territory as there are too many to name however rest assured they are of an equally high standard, lovingly made, thoroughly tasty and well presented like everything else Hawksmoor Knightsbridge has to offer.(The Old Fashioned is beyond epic)",

After going back and forth between Hawksmoor and \u00a0Blacklock, we decided to come here.Reservation was easy, and we both liked the restaurant itself. The food was ok. My girlfriend ordered Sunday roast. Just because I didn't want to order the same thing, I ordered ribeye steak. I don't know if it's our expectation was too high, we were both underwhelmed by the roast. My girlfriend was completely turned off by the \"gravy.\" It's an orangish clear liquid made from bone marrow. As you can see in my photo, my steak looked terrible. Just a slab of meat that looks really dry. It was not a juicy steak as you can guess from the picture, but it was way more flavorful than the roast. Glad that we tried Sunday roast (check!). We do not need to try it again.The location worked out great for us. It's only several minute walk away from the Victoria and Albert Museum. We took a tour at the museum in the morning and came here for a late Sunday lunch. We went back to the museum afterwards.*****************************If you found something useful in my review, please hit \"useful\" so that I can improve my reviews.

What I was looking at was all the fabulous foods they have on the menu and then trying to decide what to eat.My co-worker and I decided to split the meal so here's what we ate:Appetizer:Evesham asparagus with hollandaise sauceMain Course:Rib-eye B\u00e9arnaiseTwo fried eggsButtered English greensI found all of it to be really delicious. \u00a0I almost wished I had a larger stomach so I could have fit more in.The restaurant is very loud though so I found myself having to nearly shout at the others at the table across from me. \u00a0It is classy and tastefully decorated though and I like the layout with the waiting area and the bar. \u00a0Amazing food, but not a place for an intimate date.",

The lobster starter was perfectly tender and well seasoned. A little difficult to share but we managed just fine! Gracious server! We wanted the scallop starter but there were four of us. He offered to add an extra one without us even asking. Fantastic! We all agreed it was one of the best scallop dishes we have ever had!Our steaks came perfectly cooked to order, well seasoned and delicious. Reviewing mashed potatoes is silly right? Put me in a corner with a bowl of that magic and I would die a happy person. Fantastic food, fantastic service and a fantastic evening!Highly recommend !!!",

It quickly became one of my favorite restaurants. Fast forward a decade and there are a number of locations across London with one forthcoming in NYC I hear. Wifey and I wanted a date night and had free babysitters back at the family's house, so we went out to an old haunt of ours. We started with oysters, shared the salad and scallops as well as the steak. We had fries, spinach and bone marrow as sides. We had originally ordered bacon, but they were out and gave us bone marrow gratis. Thanks Hawksmoor. More than anything, I was shocked that the meals was significantly cheaper than we would have paid in Chicago for just as good a meal. We will definitely go back to this place on our next trip. Already drooling over it.",

If you want steak done right, this is the place to come. They also have quite a bit of seafood on the menu, and importantly this was also expertly prepared and served. The Dartmouth lobster was outstanding, as were the roasted scallops served on large shells. This place reminded me of another favorite steak house of mine, Halls Chophouse in Charleston, SC. The main difference was that the sides are so much better at Hawksmoor. We had the mash and gravy, chips and spinach, none of which could be faulted. Service very friendly and efficient. They always have a meat special, and on our visit it was 44 day aged Lincoln Red beef. Shared a 900g prime rib, cooked to perfection.",

    "text": "Known for their tender and flavorful steaks, the Hawksmoor restaurant group's location in Knightsbridge is perfectly situated near the museums and the renowned department stores, making it the perfect stop for lunch while taking in the sights, or as my friend and I chose to do, a dinner in style.We opted to start with scallops, roasted over charcoal, which gave a nice hint of smoky-ness to them, accentuated by the white port and garlic-infused butter they were served with. Since we couldn't decide on individual meals - we wanted a bit of everything as it all sounded delicious - we chose to share our mains. First we ordered a whole steamed Brixham lobster, served with garlic butter. The lobster melted in our mouths, the texture perfectly light and buttery, and the garlic didn't overpower the dish, but enhanced it. Next we chose an amazing 1.3 kg Tomahawk steak lightly cooked to perfection! If you've never had a steak at a Hawksmoor restaurant, you're truly missing out. We talked to the staff, which by the way were so outgoing and friendly, and learned that the restaurant only uses the finest British beef suppliers, using traditional methods instead of mass-produced farming. The steak was tender, rich, and honestly one of the best I've had in my lifetime. Served with triple cooked chips, the potato starch is exactly the right accompaniment to the perfect steak. I'm a sucker for a crispy, delicious chip.Despite being so full from our delectable dinner, we opted to end on a sweet note, ordering the Ambassador's Reception, a chocolate and hazelnut flavored pudding, reminiscent of a certain spread we've all enjoyed. The best part is they donate a portion of the sales to a charitable cause for world hunger. We also ordered the sticky toffee pudding, highlighted with a dollop of clotted cream. Everything about Hawksmoor Knightsbridge was exceptional. A true culinary gem!",

If you're not a true steak person then this is a nice place to go to and is totally fine, a must-go since it's kindof an institution. Steaks in london might be totally different than american steaks....??? Im not sure! The steak didnt stand out by itself, you needed all the sauces and gravy for it to taste good. Otherwise it tasted like a sponge...Not a deal breaker, gravy slathered steak with fries and sides is always a good meal!! I would come here again though, it was still a good meal...",
