The prices are reasonable, as the portions are generous, and the food is great quality. \u00a0Don't eat all day, and order all 3 courses, plus a bottle of wine. You won't regret starving.The Chef's Salad is amazing, especially if you opt for the tofu instead of feta (cheese lovers out there, I know, but really. GET THE TOFU). It's such a delight to get that big old salad, and pick around underneath for all the hidden bits. It's divine.The deserts are insane, especially when they have a lemon torte. The crumble with custard is always a good fallback.And for all you silly star spotters out there, this is where everyone famous, American and British, dine. I won't spoil it for you by telling who.",

    "text": "Sorry to be a downer, but on an absolute scale and after sampling the menu extensively, the food is terrible. Cons: Vegan options that try to be meat substitutes (eg, veatballs \u00a0dry and flavourless); Manna does much better with the menu items that are comfortable as the I am vegan options that they are. The pan-asian style items seem to offer the best flavour profiles. Pros: Attentive service, family atmosphere, and most of all, according to my vegan friends, the only real restaurant in London that offers a proper full vegan menu. So, for that, I applaud Manna. But if you do not mind being limited to a few items on the menu, other restaurants score higher on taste.",

    "text": "Very disappointed in food and service after reading all the raving reviews here. I went here for Thanksgiving as an American living in London. As a devout vegan for 14+ years I thought I'd give it a try. Firstly- the service is terrible. All of the servers are incredibly rude. My husband and I were one of the first people to be sat down and we were sat next to the door which I requested if we could have a table closer to a wall because I have a cold and asthma and did not want to have an asthma attack on thanksgiving. After explaining this to the server/hostess she just rudely said \"no\" even though at this point the restaurant was empty. She said the tables were reserved for other people- as if people know where they are going to sit? My husband and I also had reservations. None of the servers had any respect for this holiday. The food was so/so. The only course I liked was the pumpkin soup. The salad was bland. The thanksgiving nut roast course was not good at all- the roast itself was very gummy and tasteless. It tasted like raw dough. The pumpkin cheesecake was too rich and once again tasted gummy. I've been vegan for 14+ years and this was by far the worst meal I've ever had. This is very disappointing because I had such high hopes. Perhaps if the service was warmer, kinder, and trained in customer service I wouldn't have noticed the bland food as much. Usually vegan/vegetarian places are friendly and welcoming....not upsetting and rude.",

For entrees, we had the pasta special - pesto and tasty but the winner was the enchiladas - incredible!! \u00a0The espinaca was a bit stringy, but the sweet potato and pumpkin seed (one of my favorite foods!!) filling was wonderful. \u00a0No need for the rice side and the guacomole and salsa were fine, nothing extraordinaire but it was almost winter in the UK so probably not as good as when tomatoes are in season. \u00a0The bread selection was great (our entrees took some time after the starters) but he beetroot hummus was stunning - color - and tasted fine. \u00a0For dessert we had the tiramasu and the baked-stuffed apple. \u00a0Fortunately, as I don't like walnuts, they were replaced with pecans, and the \"vice\" cream was yummy. \u00a0One of the highlights of the meal was the mint/citrus infusion (tea-like) at the end of the meal - sweetened with maple syrup it was an amazing end to a fantastic meal.",

    "text": "Oh, Manna, how appropriately named you truly are, and how long I waited to find out! I'm really not sure why it took me so many years of living in London as a vegetarian and then a vegan to get round to eating at Manna. Perhaps it was being slightly put off by a friend who described it as posh and pricey, perhaps it was not quite knowing where Primrose Hill was...whatever, I couldn't be more pleased that just a couple of months ago I had the pleasure of visiting with some friends before seeing Martha Wainwright play round the corner at The Roundhouse. That's where Primose Hill is, righhhhht... I suppose Manna is sort of posh and sort of pricey, but only if 'posh' means nice, and 'pricey' means paying more than you would for okay food to receive gorgeously lovely food. All the food is vegetarian and lots of it is also vegan, and the staff (unlike another, similarly priced, vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Soho) are very sweet. A very handsome young chap of a waiter even declined to laugh in my face when I couldn't work out how to get the salt out of the dual salt/pepper grinder - now that's manners! Oh, what a terrible pun I just made, quite unwittingly...manners = mannas, geddit? Looking at their website (mannav.com) they've got a load of deals on at the moment so my next trip might be sooner than I'd planned...YUM.",

The food was delicious and, short of my mother's cooking, was all that I could have asked for to satisfy my nostalgia for traditional Thanksgiving food. Not only that, but their preparation of tempeh turkey meant that, FINALLY, I was able to have a taste of the main course that everyone always raves about. The selection was fantastic. My friend and I were served an aperitif, pumpkin soup, salad, wine, the above mentioned turkey, mash, green beans and pearl onions, sweet potatoes, mushroom gravy, cranberry sauce, AND to top it all off, dessert! The service was wonderful and the atmosphere is adorable. The food is more expensive than I would usually go for but now I will be tempted to splurge every once in a while to come visit. Very nice results on a traditional American holiday, London!",

The service is both prompt and sweet; the atmosphere is nature-inspired and relaxing; the owner is a most delightful host. This past weekend the soup of the day was the most glorious and piping hot wild mushroom and fennel treat served with tiny, fresh-from-the-oven rolls. The meze platter is a great idea: a little of everything. The croquettes are quite amazing; as I enjoy them I try to imagine how the chefs get that soft cashew cheese filling inside the perfectly round, crisp spheres...and then there are the raviolis stuffed with walnut p\u00e2t\u00e9, and graced with two gorgeous sauces. The portions are so generous it can be hard to save room for dessert but the long, tall trifle can be shared by two.Manna's guest books (a new one's just been started) contain grateful notes from people all over the world - vegans and non-vegans alike - who have never had a lovelier meal. \u00a0Their praise is well earned and deserved. Check the map well. Though very near Chalk Farm Station, Manna is located in a small road tucked away rather snugly; it's actually quite easy to find, though, after a stroll through Regent's Park coming north into Primrose Hill. Manna is unique, and a model for anyone wanting to start a vegan restaurant that treats its guests with genuine care. The world needs more wonderful places like this to visit, enjoy, remember, and revisit as soon as possible!

    "text": "As a visitor to London, i've only been to Manna once for dinner - but I was mightily impressed at that one visit! For starters, it's a lovely environment - beautiful decor, a cosy little space (even with a tiny conservatory!), and a small bar if you need somewhere to sit and wait for a table (like we did, but not for too long!). The staff when it's a bit busy can be a bit hard to get a hold of, but they are absolutely helpful, friendly and attentive when dealing with you. Let's face it - i'd not really heard much about the restaurant itself, but the food - that's what I went there for, that's what made a killer impression on me. There's a good selection of stuff on the menu without being overwhelming, and a chef's special each day if it takes your fancy. (They have quite a nice selection at the bar as well, if you take a drink with your dinner.) The presentation is impeccable for the appetisers and mains, and the portion sizes are a reasonable size for what is essentially a gourmet-style restaurant.I shared a meze plate of appetisers with my friend, because I couldn't decide what I wanted - the three we chose were the raw pad thai salad (nice and spicy), smoky tofu & potato roulade, and grilled tikka kebabs (which I could've eaten about 20 plates of and still wanted more, oh so delicious!). My friend tried the chef's special which was a nice indian take on shepherd's pie \u00a0- a really fantastic and unusual use of flavours. I was lured in by the onion rings and tried the bangers and mash - terrific gravy and an incredibly creamy mash, very fresh (I guess made on premises?) veggie sausages and those delectable onion rings on top. The only thing that irked me was the fennel in the sausages - but i'm not a lover of that flavour. I could barely finish my main, so disappointingly I couldn't try dessert at the restaurant - I was dangerously close to exploding. We got a fantastic selection of the petit fours packed up to go which I tried the next day, and they are definitely a delicious treat! One day i'll get back and try that banoffee trifle though..Thanks for the meal and the evening, Manna! I wouldn't hesitate to come back for lunch *or* dinner when I happen to be in London next.",

I have a great truffle & champagne risotto for starter, loved but main dish, beans and polenta was okay. My friends appreciated their food! I think it is worth to give it a try!",

This is one of the fancier vegetarian restaurants in London, and it has a good selection of vegan dishes as well. I highly recommend trying their desserts, especially the vegan cheesecake, which is one of the best I've had in the world.The service was passable, but not great. Our waitress hurried us out of the restaurant once we were finished. This type of customer \"service\" is something I am not accustomed to, being American, but I've since heard it's common in the UK, so I won't subtract any stars for it.",

    "text": "Service was good, nice cosy place with nice lighting. Starters were pretty good. The croquettes were very good, the tempura average and the artichoke starter was a bit flavourless. There was a stone in the tapenade and the artichoke was the texture of hard avocado. The mains were a let down. The Caribbean platter had fluffy rice full of flavour but the curry was pretty bland and like something you could whip up fairly quickly at home. The slaw was very dry and I can't imagine anyone enjoying pineapple salsa. The mix of pineapple with onion gave off the taste of durian which is a required taste.The sausage and mash was pretty average as well. The shepard's pie was less impressive. Both being like something I've had as a veggie main in a pub for half the price. We had some sides. The greens (kale) were okay and the deep fried tofu was flavourless. We really wanted to enjoy it and maybe we picked the wrong mains but it felt very over priced considering nothing really blew us away. I'd probably pop in and try the other mains for half the price but for \u00a314 I feel like I'm just paying for the convenience of vegan food above anything else that seemed like veggie pub food on a square plates.Servers were very nice and helpful which can turn an average evening into a better one.",

Went there for Sunday lunch with my parents (non-veg) and we were all amazed of the wide selection of dishes and how good, tasty and fresh everything was. We had the mushroom tempura, indonesian satay, autumn salad, risotto strudel and sunday roast, and even if we were full, we had to order dessert, everything tasted so good that we didnt want to miss anything. I also loved the fact that is vegan, so perfect for poor lactose-intolerant people like myself Was a bit pricey (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but definitely worth it. My parents have already asked me to go back there the next time they come to London...as my dad said, \"I didnt know vegetarian food could be so amazing\". Will be back, hopefully very soon",

    "text": "With 3 stars, I'm apparently bucking the trend for Manna reviews but if I'm honest, this place was quite the anticlimax. The decor was lovely, the staff attentive and the atmosphere very comfortable but where the food should have sung a veggie melody, it only whimpered a bland ballad. Sorry for that analogy - I've just been watching the X Factor.Anyway, to start we shared a variety of small dishes because we were all feeling a little too greedy to settle for one dish. My favourite of these starters was the smoked tofu won ton. Never before a tofu fan, this crunchy little surprise has made me rethink years of nose turning. However, from that tasty treat to a very dull 'living lasagne'. Thinly sliced raw beetroot is never going to win any taste prizes, especially not when it's only accompaniments are raw tomato and cashew cheese. Cashew cheese?! If anyone can explain how you milk a cashew I'm all ears. Whatever it is though - it definitely wasn't worth \u00a37.The mains carried on in a very mixed fashion with my falafel reigning supreme and chickpea curry falling far behind. Our vegan desserts were pretty patchy too - the ice cream was good but the blueberry cake was dry. I mean cotton wool on your tongue dry. Bleh.Maybe we just caught Manna on a bad day and so there's potential enough to give it another chance but as far as yum points go, I'm underwhelmed.",

However, thankfully on my journey to Manna I had the pleasure of a recently transformed vegetarian who was brimming with the exuberance of the recently converted. Billed just about everywhere as the 'best vegetarian restaurant' in London I was simply gagging to get a last minute reservation, and staff were happily receptive to my pleas. So hungry for meat substitutes and all manner of foliage, my lovely friend and I began the painstaking process of choosing our meal, sampling a selection of grains (their names escape me, I was too engaged in stimulating conversation over a Kir Royale) finalising on a Chef's salad served with crispy marinated tofu, now featuring celeriac, roasted fennel, winter potato salad, raw carrot, raw grated beetroot and many more deliciously tasty treats. I told her I disliked beetroot, but was actually lying as I scoffed several mouthfuls! However, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance had to be the enchilada casserole layered exquisitely with cashew cheese, black beans & rich mole sauce, sandwiching tortillas served with green rice, carrot salsa & guacamole. That dish alone was well worth the Israelites venturing into the wilderness seeking the holy manna. Beautiful company, effortless food and service, jumping straight into my London top ten seamlessly.",

I was warmly welcomed and seated right away.I ordered a glass of sauvignon blanc and started with the arrancini - before my appetizer arrived, the restaurant started to fill up and another singleton arrived but was almost turned away before I invited him to join my table, so we shared dinner at Manna. \u00a0Now I have more things to review! \u00a0- Arrancini - incredible and delicious, the sauce was so good!- Polenta tart - I've made polenta plenty but never put it in a \u00a0pan - this was really a fancy way of doing it, and the salad and herbs in this super creamy polenta was very quiche-like- Bangers & mash - topped with a trio of perfectly crispy onion rings, the homemade vegan sausages were delicious and not totally an analog of meat (not chewy but flavorful) and with baby kale and the most amazing mashed potatoes -- huge portion (I took half of it away to eat on the airplane later)- Chocolate-peanut butter custard -- this was INCREDIBLE -- there's nothing better than chocolate AND peanut butter and this dessert did not disappoint, rich chocolate ganache on top that was creamy/fudgy and not set hard with a rich thick peanut butter custard underneath, topped with candied nuts. \u00a0If you go to ONE fancy vegan place for dinner - this should be your choice. \u00a0It's not cheap (I paid $65 for app, entree, dessert & two glasses of wine) but service is impeccable and the food is outstanding.",

We decided to try a bit of everything and the most recommended dishes- the bangers and mash, nachos, and enchilada. I'm sorry to say but none of the dishes blew me away. Generally when I try \"recreations\" of meat dishes I'm certainly not expecting them to taste of meat, but I expect them to be delicious. The bangers and mash were warm-ish, which sort of bugged me. The textures started blending together along with the flavours, which sort of made the dish a gooey mess. When looking at the pictures I was expecting piping hot mash, flavourful and thick bangers (yes I just said that) and crunchy hot onion rings. I got none of that. The enchilada had more flavour and spice, which I was thankful for but the depth of flavours was also lacking. Nachos were good.",

The staff was friendly and welcoming in a very relaxed way, which felt fitting.My girlfriend and I ordered a \"mezza\" to share, and were able to pick three appetizers or salads for a reduced price. The Brazilian cashew croquettes made up one of the most delicious small plates I've ever had, sort of a vegetarian's crab rangoon as my girlfriend put it. The vegetarian sushi was good, but definitely needed the soy sauce to come together, and the naked tacos were good despite not being our favorite.The only reason I can't give five stars is because we unfortunately found a dead fly on one of our salad leaves, quite literally attached by the wing somehow. I let the waitress know and this may be when their chill nature may have failed them, as she lightly apologized but it wasn't mentioned again or brought up to a manager. For a restaurant that charges \u00a38-10 for any of these small appetizers, including \u00a39 for only three of those croquettes, I expected much more hospitality for a clear mistake like that.",

    "text": "Thanksgiving at Manna gave me a home away from home this holiday season. As a vegetarian, it's next to impossible to find somewhere to have a veggie American Thanksgiving in London, but Manna fills that need with a multicourse meal that has everything you could want. Pumpkin soup, salad course, tempeh roast, mashed potato, stuffing, cranberry sauce, green beans, saut\u00e9ed onions, a dessert of either pumpkin cheesecake or apple pie. My one wish is that they'd make traditional pumpkin pie as it is one of the highlights of the season for me! But regardless, excellent meal in a beautiful environment with a friendly and accommodating staff. All I could have asked for on Thanksgiving.",

I recommend ordering the following starters: Cannellini bean slider, raw lasagne (note that it is served cold), and the indian pizza. \u00a0If you and your guest want to share 3 starters, I recommend ordering the manna meze to share. \u00a0With the manna meze, you can order any 3 starters or salads for 22 pounds. \u00a0If you go on Sunday, the chef's special is fantastic. \u00a0I shared the chef's special nut loaf with kale - It is perfect Sunday comfort food. \u00a0I love this place.",

    "text": "Food - Pretty damn tasty. Between us, we tried the bangers & mash, Sunday roast and baja california plate. I can especially recommend the roast and baja. The blueberry cheesecake though... strangely rubbery and uncheesecake-like. Not so nice at all.Cost - Thought it was a bit over-priced, sorry Manna. We took the Manna meze for \u00a322 to start and it was teeny tiny. A spoonful of salad, half a miniature cashew cheese croquette each (admittedly, very tasty) and one stick of vegetable tempura. Unhappy face. :(Service - We had a friendly waitress and a rather odd waiter who seemed painfully shy and not at all suited to serving the public. But he had a fantastic afro in which he kept his pencil, and I managed to coax a smile out of him by the end of the night.If I scored a pay rise, I reckon I'd come here again. Otherwise, much as I enjoyed the food, I'll probably stick with other cheaper and tastier veggie options.",

It was tough to get the waitstaff's attention; when we wanted to order, when we wanted more to drink, when we wanted to see a dessert menu, when we wanted to the bill, and when we wanted to pay. We spent more time waiting to get the staff's attention than enjoying the food. The surprising part is that they were preoccupied wiping utensils - quite loudly, and talking amongst each other. The tacos and soup were really nice.",

    "text": "Such perfection! I decided I had to try Manna while I'm living in London even though it's rather expensive. Great decision! I had the (vegan) bangers and mash and it was so much better than the original I remember from my pre-vegan days. My friend had the enchilada lasagne, which was delicious as well. The portions were large enough to sate us and to keep us from ordering dessert. The wine was quite nice as well, a maybe that paired nicely with my meal. I'm so satisfied with my experience at Manna and hopefully will make it back someday!",

We popped in on a Friday and they were all booked up, so we made a reservation for the following night as were set on trying it. They have a varied vegan menu with good raw options as well (like Raw lasagne). Our food was excellent and the waitstaff were very attentive. They have a great wine and dessert list to boot. Can't wait to go back.",

The service was pretty standard for England; jaded, no smiles, no information or opinions to offer so it's a good thing the food spoke for itself. We had:Jalapeno-Cashew Cheese Croquettes- very yummy but not very warmNachos- disappointing. oh well.Bangers and Mash- absolutely dee-lish!Sticky Toffee Pudding- HEAVENLY!!Half of the meal was average but the other half was so epic that it didn't matter! Seriously looking forward to coming back and trying other things!!",
