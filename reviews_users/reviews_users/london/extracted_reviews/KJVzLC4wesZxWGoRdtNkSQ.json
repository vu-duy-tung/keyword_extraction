Starter of edamame was overcooked and bland. Impressive because it's hard to mess up edamame. However, the salmon nigiri was sublime. Melt in your mouth. We also ordered two tuna hand rolls, which were serviceable. The two specialty rolls--crispy yellowtail and spicy tuna--were not to our liking. Regardless, we were filled and the tab was cheap. I think we may have chosen unwisely.",

I opted for a seaweed and cucumber salad and the yellow tail sashimi. My salad was light and delicious. I was most surprised how tasty the sashimi was. My man opted for a sushi cut and hand roll, which supposedly was good as well.The only problem I had with Eat Tokyo was the slow service. It took our food forever to come out and they brought out my food first and then waited about 10 minutes to bring out my man's, which was a bit strange. Otherwise, tasty, good, and easy on the wallet. I'll be back.",

Not much elbow room, as they've shoved as many tables and chairs as possible into this small space, but somehow it doesn't bother me. One thing that does annoy me is they are quite strict when it comes to how long you can use the table for. They start to get finicky once you've gone over an hour. So this isn't the place for you if you want to have a nice long relaxing meal. My favourite dishes are the prawn tempura roll, seaweed + cucumber salad, harumaki (spring rolls), & the chicken katsu (better than any chicken nugget you've ever had in your life)! Enjoy!",

So far, Eat Tokyo is the best place to satisfy all of those wants. Eat Tokyo is a small restaurant situated just off the hustle and bustle of Notting Hill Gate. They have an extensive menu that should satisfy sushi and non-sushi eaters alike. The fish is fresh and the items are priced reasonably by London standards. Something that I also really enjoyed is this didn't seem like sushi place catering to Londoners in the city. I honestly feel like I'm back home in California when I come here, in a cozy sushi joint frequented mostly by regulars and locals. I think that's the best about it honestly.In addition to the food and the vibe, the service is very good. They are very attentive, but also not rushing out out of your seats (even though this place does get very busy during dinnertime). I would highly recommend if you're looking for some good fresh sushi that won't break the bank.",

On the same street as the more famous \"Feng Sushi\" and very close to the new enormous \"Itsu\" in Notting Hill Gate- I've just eaten the best California Rolls I've had in London! I also had edamame and a wonderful spicy squid and a coke for just \u00a310!The chef and staff are Japanese and they are clearly very proud of the food they serve and the way they serve it. The chef appears to have quite a history of awards and the fact everything is in Japanese with smaller English print (sometimes!) underneath speaks volumes about their target market- London's resident Japanese population (and anyone else with a sense of curiousity or adventure!). They also seem to do very reasonable take away lunches for about \u00a34.50. Well worth a visit-I'll probably be back once a week at least!",

    "text": "Cheap eats doesn't always work out to be a good meal but in this case, it was. Lunch specials start at only \u00a39 for a bento and the portion is enough for a substantial meal. The menu is large - choose from sushi, rolls, tempura, soba, tonkatsu, teriyaki, salmon, donburi, etc. I was happy with my bento's quality - tasty miso soup, salad with dressing, lots of rice, pickles and your choice of main (one or two). The star was actually the fried tofu which was soft on the inside, a slight crisp shell soaked in soy dashi and topped with wakame. I left full and happy!On the down side, staff need to work on their customer service. Definitely not the traditional customer-first attitude most Japanese restaurants provide. I also had to ask for more water as no one checked on me mid-meal. Decor is minimal and you literally walk through the crowded kitchen to get to the seating area. It's not somewhere I would take a date but if you want cheap and cheerful, this is your place.",

Nothing fancy and not exactly minimalist Japanese. The menu covers everything from shushi and tempura to bento boxes and is almost a bit overwhelming. Perhaps lucky then that most cooked food was unavailable due to a major repairs to the gas mains outside. We ended up with a random selection of raw and fried foods - all delicious.Staff were extremely helpful and friendly, no wonder this is such a favourite with locals.",

Whilst this place is a little cramped it really is worth it.The fish tastes extremely fresh and the salmon and tuna sashimi were melt in the mouth. I found the tempura vegetables a little flavourless and the dipping sauce for it didn't have much taste however this is my only complaint. The fried seafood dumplings were delectable and a bargain at \u00a33 for 4. I am a bit of a spicy tuna maki aficionado and the standard here is good. The plum wine was sweet and delicious too! With lots of sushi restaurants vying for business I really feel that this place is a cht above the rest.",

You should just use the parts of fish that is cheaper or just give less. But never use lower quality (I.e. Older less fresh).Most of the menu was typical Westernized sushi/sushi roll items that was not the most inspiring menu I have ever seen in my life. In fact I am rather uninspired.The prices are very reasonable but then it is because the quality is not the best I has seen (average). Service was so-so, in fact the server gave everyone's bills and I gave up waiting for mine after 10-15 minutes despite trying to chase down people. I almost felt like I needed to walk out for them to action. The restaurant is managed by one or two Japanese person but the kitchen is mainly staffed w people of Southeast Asian background (they are competent of course just want to point out not everyone is Japanese as some reviews may lead you to believe).You should strive to eat fresher and better Japanese food if you can. Otherwise this place will do fine if you need a quick fixer upper in this area (close to Nottinghill Gate tube station). I would only come back to this \"meh\" place if I had to... But not worth going out of my way.",
