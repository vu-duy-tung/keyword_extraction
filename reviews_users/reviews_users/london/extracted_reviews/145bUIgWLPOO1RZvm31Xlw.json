There are a few communal tables in the restaurant but it isn't a huge venue so we usually get take out.",

It's built in the style of a classic caff with white tiled walls, simple, comfortable and communal tables and big windows facing out onto busy Theobald's Road. This is the home of the law courts and legal bigwigs, but leave any pretensions at the door along with your brolly. The servings of fresh plaice, cod and whiting are massive, for the price, and come with an optional slice of buttered crusty white bread, a pyre of chips and lashings of whatever sauce you may fancy. I was foolish enough to ask for a large chips with my meal last time I visited, thinking I had an appetite. 30 seconds later I was sitting at my table contemplating how I was going to even attempt to tackle the kilo of fried potatoes on my plate...",

I'm as limp as the utterly ordinary (okay, rubbish) food I just ate. Any chippy, anytime, anywhere, is as good as this. Not worse, but every bit as good. Which is to say: completely medicore. Seriously, fellow citizen-reviewers, have you ever actually eaten good fish and chips? Where the chips are crisp on the outside and fluffy in the middle? Where the fish still tastes of the sea? Have you? Really? Until recently I lived at the seaside. Okay, they have an advantage in the freshness department. But honestly, even the worst chippy in my old town was better than this. Giving five stars to this sort of swill is an insult to statisticians. Avoid!",

    "text": "OMG. Where do i begin here. Ive eaten in many restaurants in my life as my family has always been into food, running a restaurant for many years, and I've learn't to enjoy various flavors from all around the world. I'm as comfortable in a Michelin starred restaurant in a posh area in London as i am in a beautifully run down hole in a wall in the Southern reaches of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. Now, Ive wanted to write a review on yelp for a long time but i am probably too busy enjoying the food Ive been eaten and leave it up to others to write reviews.Until now.This place has inspired me to tell the world to never ever go here. Haha Its actually funny in hindsight, and actually when we were chowing down on the chewy refrozen chips we kinda giggled at how badly we chose this place.I used to live in London for a few years so i have been re visiting some of my old haunts and old favorites, yesterday my girlfriend suggested we go to a fish and chips place - as its a good English thing to do.We rocked up to Holborn, and walked over to the place from the Tube stop. Walking past a fantastic looking old school butcher i thought, hell yeah we are in a good part of town where the tourists dont go and this will be tasty!There are great booths to sit at in The Fryers Delight, great old photos and reviews from famous people and a great big Take away menu full of interesting fried goods including Cod Roe Fry.We sat down with a fried piece of Cod, chips, peas, and a fried piece of Cod Roe. As Im an adventurous type and i love all things roe, i had to try this.First sign of trouble:As we are kinda impartial to a good mushy pea (like the one at Harry's in Sydney) we asked what kind of peas, and whether they were the mushy type, the waitresses answer, no they are processed.Ok, maybe i could live with this.What proceeded was the worst meal Ive had in a Long time! The peas were indeed from a can, no matter, i do like things from a can sometimes! But these peas tasted like they were cooked in Mineral Turpentine. i kid you not.The cod was precooked so it was luke warm. The fish although frozen was ok inside, it was frozen fresh so it wasn't deadly but the batter was terrible and soggy and limp.The chips, the best things on out plate, felt dry and frozen several times before being cooked.Now the Cod roe. wow. I have never tasted anything that vile. It was obviously cut from a solid block that was fallen from a can. It had the smooth sides to prove it. Ive smelt dog food before and you can imagine what it could taste like, but this cod roe actually tasted that bad. It had so much vinegary preservatives in it that kept it from rotting, i had two little bites as i was game enough to give it another go.We also had a little side dish of pickled egg, I now can taste the difference between fresh vinegar and bad sourness like i had in the roe.We left kinda smiling at how in the world other people actually rated this place, even if we went at the wrong time of day, No place that serves food to the public should be allowed to what they did to us.",

Tartar sauce is extra and is just packets. It's a no-frills place, with nice employees, but I can't imagine wanting to go back. Also, they don't serve alcohol, so plan accordingly.",

Every time I am in London I seek this place out for a good meal. I enjoy the plaice, haddock, or cod depending on my mood. The fryers really do know their craft!Inside is clean, tidy, and vintage. Formica obviously lasts a long time. There is no pretense or posturing here with the food, decor, and staff. They serve great fish traditionally prepared in a simple environment.Located very near the British Museum, it is worth the short walk. I recommend this shop to everyone who wants the real deal without the high price and pretense.",

Nothing has changed inside Fryer's Delight in the two and a half years since I set foot in here. Which is no surprise as it might not have changed since before I was born. The only thing that needed to change for me to like this place a lot was the freshness of the fish. And that is one thing that has, thankfully, changed since my last visit. \u00a0The fish was good enough to bump up my previous rating to 4 whole stars. I would have left skipping, if I hadn't been so full I could barely walk. Remember this is a \"chippy\" and the food comes with no frills. However, it is good enough not to need any. And stepping inside is like stepping back in time. There aren't many places left you can buy time travel AND good fish for a tenner.",

In the day and age of fancy coffee shops and hipster food trucks, it always feels good to enter a classic chippy. There's something nice and real about these almost tacky colours everywhere, somethings that just tells you that \"this is it, no bullshit\".My friends and I decided to wait 5-10 minutes for a booth to be free and eat there, while a number of people came in and out to get their fish and chips as take-away. While we were waiting they asked us fif we wanted any fish, to start preparing it.Haddock, chips and mushy peas. The batter of the fish was light and nice, so extra kudos.Really, it's all you'd want for a fish and chips place. I mean, what else could you possibly expect ?",

In most cuisines (and for me personally) the best deep frying is the one that can be wrapped in paper with the paper coming off dry. I don't know whether that's the case with fish and chips, but if it is, The Fryer's Delight just isn't very good. It was very greasy and so heavy that we couldn't even finish half of our meal. There was also not nearly enough acidity, and as we took our meal to go we couldn't add any. We did buy a pickled onion which was a bit messy to eat, but it really saved the meal. Without that acidity, it was too one-note to have more than a couple of bites.",

The waitress plunks down plate (or platter... certainly big enough to call it that) straight from the counter - a big ol hunk of golden fish, three handfuls of fries, a wedge of lemon and off you go. Salt shaker and bottle of malt vinegar are on the table. All are crucial for bringing out the flavor, but also especially because they make the \"Fish&Chips\" experience everything you imagined. A burly man hauled up wire-baskets-full of their chunky squarecut potatoes from a rather dodgy looking basement, at least 3x while we ate, which means they go through them like crazy. In other words, when it comes to frying this place knows what they're doing and they do it a lot (which came first? who knows, but it's a good cycle to get stuck in).",
