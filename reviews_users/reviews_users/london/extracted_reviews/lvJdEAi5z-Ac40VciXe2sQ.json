However, I prefer mine with the skin off and it has never been a problem before in any pub, restaurant or even chippy (who are usually happy to make a skinless version for a couple minutes extra wait). Garfunkel's staff, however, not only seemed to assume at first I was referring to the batter (please hire some stuff that speaks sufficient English) but even assured me that it came without. Well, when the food arrived it actually still had the skin on and it took 5 minutes to get anyones attention at all. Eventually she went to check back and told me that the manager said they won't do it because it will make the fish fall apart (strange, how does everybody else manage?). Besides, shouldn't the chef decide not the manager. At \u00a313 per portion I wouldn't expect it to be that unreseanable to ask for. That was my first and my last visit to this establishment. Afterwards we went to a pub just a minute down the sidestreet where I got served skinless battered fish no problem. Thanks Garfunkel's.",

    "text": "Heading back home to Sweden, taking the Heathrow Express train, this is one of the closest restaurants in immediate vicinity to Paddington station. \u00a0I say restaurants because although it is a chain it still looks like a proper and fresh place for lunch. However let me assure you looks can be deceiving and choosing this particular Garfunkel's is one of the worst food experiences I ever had in London.They do brag about their \"famous\" Fish & Chips with minted mushy peas, for \u00a312.99, but they should have kept it on the down low. The batter was thick without any fluff and \"after fryer kept warm in the oven over done and dry\" so much so we needed a hammer and chisel to cope with it only to discover grease soaked slimy under cooked fish underneath, go figure as it did amaze us in addition to how same kitchen can't make the chips as crisp as the fish, they were badly soggy, so much so it would have been better to order mushy chips to accompany the bland tasting mushy peas minus any hint of the mint. The lunch menu offers priecewise and combination-wise a better choice, and a visit to a salad bar that is fresh and tasty, it contains of usual herb, green, pasta and bean salads and cold cuts all in all a great and good for the value antipasto. However when choosing the 2 or 3 courses combo, at \u00a38.99 and 10.99, from the menu your visit to the salad bar is kept short by giving you a plate more than less in the same size as a coffee cup plate. It should be said that the friendly and accommodating \u00a0waitresses did tell us to have another go at it if we wished. And in hindsight , we should have cause the mains were disappointing again. Lemon & Herb Chicken Escalope should ratter be called just grilled Chicken Escalope. We all agreed that the chicken was never in presence of nor marinated in any lemon, fresh herbs, garlic and olive oil. Salmon & Broccoli Fishcakes were perhaps the dish of they day as we found nothing wrong with them but nor was it anything right with them and the tartar sauce does usually help hide kitchen mischief. \u00a0 Perhaps we were wrong and not adventurous enough to choose other courses that were not British or British-like mains, but we strongly doubt it. We also have had enough level of adventure trying to locate the Restrooms throughout a labyrinth of stairs and conference rooms as it lies in another part of the building which is a hotel.",

In the end I ordered the goats cheese veggie burger, which cost just under \u00a310.The food arrived and was just pathetic. The burger was served with a limp lettuce leaf and a slice of tomato, plus a few chips. The menu said this burger came with pesto but I couldn't find any in there. The taste wasn't that bad but it was ridiculous for something costing \u00a310! The food looked beige and bland and the plate was half empty. If I had been the one paying I would have complained there and then.Added to that I ordered beer which came at room temperature, which wasn't very pleasant. Although most of the staff were pleasant I found one waitress to be quite rude. My father ordered an all day breakfast, and a plate of garlic bread with cheese for the table, and was told You don't need that, your food comes with toast. It's one thing to make sure he knows it comes with toast, another to directly tell him what he does/doesn't need to eat. He did get the garlic bread, minus the cheeseI don't normally write reviews of restaurants etc, but this was so bad I don't want to let it go.",

In a nutshell: it was an absolutely greasy, dry, and unsavory experience. Every single item of the sharing platter was deep-fried or reheated (supposedly from the evening before). The taste was bad \u00a0the batter was either too hard or spongy; even the nachos were spongy. Fish & Chips: Worst thing ever. I had to dig very deep into the adamant batter in order to find the fish which was neither fresh nor tasty. Every canned fish would have been better. By Scampi, we didn't expect little deep-frozen shrimps hidden in a brown and spongy batter which resemeble wellindistinctive crumbs of something. Either the oil needs to be renewed or the chef. At least the drinks were ok. Service was ok. We were charged more than 37 bucks for that adventure. I'd rather consider another investment such as ___________ (please insert ANY restaurant here) in the immediate vicinity. For the management: I hope that I just had a bad day. Good location and nice ads are not the core business of a restaurant. Thank you!",

The ambience and menu seemed not to have changed since the late '70s and was ridiculously overpriced. I ordered grilled gammon with Jacked potato and the potato was an health hazard. Just looking at the colour ( pinkish and gluey) didn't look like jacked potato and was certainly not inviting. I bravely attempted a taste and had to spit it out it was so foul. The rest was barely edible. To sum it up, avoid it if you don't want to risk food poisoning.",

The staff were stood around talking to each other or pottering around with table settings and ingnored us completely.We ordered a starter each and a main meal each at 5.30pm. At 6.00pm - half an hour after our order was taken the waitness brought us our main meals - NOT our starter and asked us if we wanted to have the main meal first (very odd!) she looked very confused and tried to just leave the meals with us. At this point we had reached the end of our tether as we had a show to get to at 7.00pm. We told the waitress we wernt happy and left the restaurant. We ended up going across the road and having a quick Burger King meal instead!! - much quicker , cheaper and much better service!I would only recommend this restaurant if you dont mind slow service for very over priced food and drinks - and also if you like eating your started after your main course!",

I noticed this place as we were heading to the Waterway for dinner while using the tube. So Yes I am an American tourist. We came in excited to eat a full British breakfast since we had a full Irish breakfast several times in Ireland. We were greeted openly and with a friendly face by the hostess/waitress. We ordered one All day British breakfast, cottage pie , still water, and a Chocolate Garfunkel milkshake. First review \"Garfunkel's milkshakes\"According to the drink menu the Garfunkel Milkshake is made with a blend of milk and ice cream in you flavor of Chocolate, strawberry or vanilla. I choose the chocolate. Well I am no expert in European milkshakes but I can say I qualify for milkshakes review with the many versions of milkshakes I have tasted in the USA. With the presentation you can already tell there was something off with the drink. Once I took my first sip, I got a mouth full of chocolate syrup and then milk. In my opinion this tasted like chocolate milk and not a chocolate shake. The consistency is very fluid and missing the thickness consistency that shakes usually have. \u00a0It seems like they only blend cold milk with chocolate syrup. I may be wrong and they did blended ice cream but by the time it got to my table it was like drinking a glass of chocolate milk. 2 out of 5 since they got the milk and chocolate portion right. Cottage pie Bland steam veggiesGravy and meat was okayMash was over cooked or to dry on the top. My expertise with gravy and mash comes from the homemade mash potato and gravy I get at home and my experience with Australia's pies with mash peas, mash potatoes, and Gravey all over. The \u00a0British breakfast Was okay, was expecting to have blood sausage or blood pudding. The sausage they gave us was a little mushy. It lacks that firm texture. Not unless it really supposed to be like that. 3 out of 5Garlic breadWaitress asked us if wanted bread with our breakfast. We said sure will have the garlic bread. Not knowing it was an extra charged. We were charged \u00a35.25 for bread! The breakfast cost \u00a310.95. \u00a0So yeah next time asked if bread comes with the meal or if it's an additional charge!But yeah overall, if your really hungry and got no where to eat I guess this place will be good to satisfy your hunger. Hope this helps anyone planning to eat here. I am sure their other menu options must be tasty but the ones we ordered was not satisfying.",

Well, that was a big mistake because when I finally got the attention of the waiter to find out where the menu was, he started dressing me down for helping myself to a seat. I guess customer service isn't a big thing at these restaurants, and the fact that it was empty probably said a lot.

    "text": "I've eaten At Garfunkels before and the one near Kensington actually does a very good breakfast.This particular outlet was absolutely terrible. Service was excrutiatingly slow. We asked for a starter sampler platter which took 45 minutes to arrive - the onion rings in it were dripping oil, but the worst part of the dish was one of the accompanying sauces - it was named sweet chilli sauce, but it tasted like water. Like they had served us the second rinse from a bottle of sauce. When we politely brought it to the attention of the manager, he refused to accept that there was anything wrong with it. We told him to take it away, we did not receive a replacement, nor did we even receive an apology!I appreciate that a restaurant can run out of sauce (even at 7:45 pm on a weekday when the restaurant runs till 11pm), but you can always serve a different sauce from your menu instead. Customers can accept a substitution, not watered down rubbish.We had waited for the arrival of the starter to decide if we would need 1 or 2 main courses between the 3 of us. So when the female server brought the starter to the table, we ordered a pizza and a ribs - 30 minutes later, when we asked how much longer it would take, we were told that our main course order hadn't been placed.The lady who took our order was managing the till too, it's not like we have the order to someone who was just bussing tables. Again, no apology was offered or explanation given. The pepperoni pizza was average, the ribs were soft but overloaded with barbecue sauce that I scraped off before eating. We had to request tap water at least 4 times, before it actually appeared.The cappuccino was average, the queen of chocolates \u00a0(hot chocolate) was better than average, however that is no reason to ever go back to this place.We wasted 2 hours here on terrible food & service, in what we thought was a fast food restaurant. If I'm hungry around Paddington, I should just head straight to Ya Hala - fresh tasty food, superlative service and quick turnover.",

This one is definitely on the low end of the quality scale.The food was greasy, soggy and bland. Service was friendly but excruciatingly slow. I had to go looking for my server three times because they just didn't show up anymore. When I asked a different server for help, she just barked at me that I wasn't in her area. Great. Once my server showed up again, she'd give polite and friendly service... And then disappear again.Definitely won't be coming back to this branch.",

    "text": "I ended up eating at this Garfunkel's during my most recent trip to London due to its convenient location to my hotel and Paddington Station. I admit, normally on a big trip I try to be a bit more adventurous about where I eat, and try to actually find somewhere other than the eatery that's attached to my hotel. But after flying seven hours overnight - not to mention navigating the enormous Heathrow and sitting through a train ride to this part of the city - my mother and I were famished, and so were more than happy to give the hotel restaurant a shot.Since it was about 9am when we stopped in my mother and I ignored all the window ads for their shakes and fish and chips, and instead went straight to the breakfast menu. I opted for the eggs benedict, and she went for the eggs florentine. And there were no complaints from either of us food-wise - we both felt that the bread we received was warm and perfectly toasted, that the eggs were fresh and light, and that the toppings (ham, hollandaise sauce and chives for me - spinach, hollandaise sauce and chives for her) had exactly the blend of flavors we were each looking for in our meals. It wasn't a fancy or extraordinary meal by any means, but it was a nice one. (Granted, we were pretty famished after the long night by the time we got here, so I suspect the only reason we would have hated anything served to us at that point would be if it was served to us burned.)I admittedly can't rate this as more than an \"a-ok\" place. The food, while just what we needed after a long night's flight, was pretty standard fare for a chain. And the layout of the place had one major quirk: to get to the bathrooms you need to leave the restaurant and trek to the lower levels of the hotel itself - and there's quite the maze of hallways, doors, and stairs to navigate to get there! Finally, there's the fact that the service felt a bit slow for a quiet morning - plus, while looking around I got the sense that the place could have used a little more attention the last time it was cleaned. All of that considered, I'm going with an \"a-ok\" for my experience at Garfunkel's. And while a nice, simple meal may have been perfect at the time, I definitely think the one visit to the one location in this chain was enough for me.",

    "text": "We stayed nearby, wanted to like this place, but the food was rather bland, as is the case with most English food. The meat pies are good, not the fish and chips. Decent service, wide variety of tourist frequent this place. I am a bit biased since I don't particularly like English food, I like spicy, deep flavors, aromas, etc... English food is just not my cup of tea. Fortunately, we headed to Rome after our stay in London, where I got my foodie fix. I'd still recommend this place for a quiet place, if thirsty, walk 2 to 3 minutes off the main st and get to a decent pub. Same kind of food but the beers are better and less pricey.",

We had to ask to pay multiple times. We flagged her down for the \u00a0payment of the bill but went on to seat 4 other groups and take all of their orders and bu 5 other tables before she came to ours. This took about 30 minutes for us to pay and leave! She purposely dragged service at our table. Even yelled at us for making a small mistake about water since this is our first time in London. The food is very below average. Its what I call a bad stocking stuffer. Itll fill you up for a small price, but its not that good. Id give this place 0 stars if I could. Absolutely horrible. Bland food, and horrible service. Absolutely ruined my London experience. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM HERE!! Plenty of other options around that are way better.",
