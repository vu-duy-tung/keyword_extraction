Two of us are vegetariens and one doesn't like tomatoes \u00a0no problem, all of our special requests were happily taken care of. When we came back a few days later for a pint the owner recognised us which I think is amazing in a town like London and a sign that he really cares about his customers. The pub itself is the regular, cozy English kind of pub, just the way you want it to be. Highly recommended and absolutely easy to reach as it is located within 50m of Lancaster Gate station.",

There is also a terrace which overlooks the park but that was hired out for a private party when I was there, so we were unable to sit up top. The pub is rather basic and nothing special but they do serve cheap food and you they have roast lunch already cooked up so you can eat really quickly if you are starving (or in a rush).",

We needed a quick lunch on a cold afternoon--after an overnight, transatlantic flight--and the Swan it the spot. The daily special salad was crayfish and avocado, and came with boiled potatoes, arugula, and lemon and was light, fresh, and filling. Also generous glass pours of wine at very reasonable rates. I recommend the South African Chenin Blanc.I'd go back, which says enough in and of itself. Or so I'd like to think.",

When the beer I did order remained to be seen, even after my wife had gone through half of hers, our sad nachos arrived. I queried the server about my beer and was told shortly that she only dealt with the food and I'd have to hail the barman to deal with it. Certainly, after I did as such, the beer arrived quickly.

    "text": "Hubby and I grabbed a couple drinks a few times at the Swan because our hotel was located right down the street from the pub and we would pass it every time we went to/returned from the tube (I heart the TUBE!). I loved how quaint and historical it looked. It was awesome being able to sit down outside (or inside) and have a pint after a long and exhausting, but absolutely wonderful, day of exploring London. The inside is nice and dark and woody and loud. Since Hubby's younger brother is studying in London, we brought him to the Swan one night, and it was nice to throw back snakebites, ciders, and beers, and to have lovely conversation at near-scream voice levels inside (there was a live band playing inside that night). Another plus for me was the fact that it is located right across the street from the park and therefore offered nice views of lush, beautiful trees.I miss London pubs.",

The beer range is limited to Fuller's but that's not an entirely bad thing. A nice, traditional spot to drink some London-made cask ales. A place to visit out of convenience, not a place to make an effort visiting.",

    "text": "I love The Swan.I come here all the time, especially when Mom is in town and staying at the hotel next door. The interior encapsulates exactly what I expect from an English pub: sturdy wooden tables that are great for groups, richly colored, and cozy. There's an outdoor area in the front with long tables and heat lamps that is nice in the fall, but still too chilly in the winter.The drink selection is good, although I admit I always go for the Aspall cider on tap (delicious). They have live music on certain nights, which always seems to fall on the nights I'm there, and I really enjoy it. It can get pretty loud, but if you find the right table it's ideal. Now, the tough part. I love this place, and if you do too, and you want to continue to enjoy it, do not eat the food. Just don't. Okay, you can have the cheese platter or some chips for a nibble, but that's it.There will be tests of your resolve. You will be tempted by the trendy handwritten chalkboard menu. And the carvery set up at the bar. And the upstairs seating area reserved for meals only. Remember: this place is not for meals, it is for relaxing after a long walk in Hyde Park or enjoying drinks with a group of friends. It is great for those things. If you are a tourist who has been traipsing around London with a group all day in the bitter cold and your feet hurt and you want to warm up in an old English pub (with the requisite morbid historical backstory) with a pint, then welcome to The Swan. You'll love it here. If you're hungry, then move on.In summation: pints with friends, yes. Food- wise: perpetuates every stereotype out there about English cuisine (many of which I don't agree with.)",

Our hotel was located right around the corner from this place, so we decided to leave it for the very last day.When we got to the place, it was fairly empty. Unfortunately, the upstairs with seating overlooking the street was unavailable. So we got outdoor seating downstairs.We quickly got menus and placed our orders. The wait for the food and tea was no more than 10-15 minutes. The Eggs Royal were very tasty and beautifully plated. The teapots with our tea were a very nice touch. The English breakfast tea itself had great flavor too.All around great service, food and drink. Highly recommend.",

We decided upon Bangers and Mash, London Pride and Fish and Chips (of course!!). The food was all absolutely delicious, but the hands down winner was the fish and chips. The best fish and chips we had while visiting London, by far. The batter was light, crispy and flavorful. The mushy peas were a delight and the tartar sauce was perfect. We were satisfied with the other meals, as well. A couple of Fuller's pints while on the patio followed by a walk through Hyde Park afterwards made for a truly enjoyable experience all around. Highly recommended!!",

Other than that the meal was fine. The peas and carrots were properly cooked, Chips were HOT!!! The beef pie was good but a little salty. I didn't eat the red cabbage.

We lucked into a table for two which I held while my partner ordered our meal and drinks . \u00a0Menu selection is good with a nice choice of meat, seafood and vegetarian items. \u00a0Service was prompt and good. \u00a0Fish and chips were hot and delicious.

    "text": "Honestly the best steak pie we had during our entire stay in London. \u00a0The American girl behind the bar was so helpful - really made a nice introduction for us, as out-of towners. \u00a0Cool layout, and wide demographic (from posh young guys outside having a pint with their mates on the way home, to oldsters having dinner inside) - just a really nice atmosphere.However, the second time we went, the fish in the fish and chips definitely tasted of ammonia. \u00a0If you eat fish frequently, you know this means the fish has gone off. \u00a0That would be OK, things happen, right, but after we drew it to their attention, the manager wanted to debate it (after they had cleared away the remains). \u00a0I told him it tasted like ammonia, he pushed back and said nobody else ever complained...which doesn't mean the fish hadn't gone off (it had). \u00a0He thought it was a financial thing, like we wanted a free dinner, to his further discredit....and so, comped it. \u00a0We felt like he should refund it, since the fish had gone off, and so, took the comp. \u00a0A 2-star experience, but otherwise, the service, and everything else we had here was great, so, plus one star. \u00a0Won't be back.",
