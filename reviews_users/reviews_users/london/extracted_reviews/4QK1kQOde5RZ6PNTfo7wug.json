    "text": "gave it a third go. this time for dinner. seriously.the dinner menu is full of big comfort foods and while they were tasty, my mind was not blown. i got a ham and chicken pie with a puff pastry crust. the filling was so runny, it was like soup. once i had the crust all pushed in it was good (read: the crust was a saving grace), but worth \u00a310.50? i dunno. ditto on my partners reaction to his steak and kidney pudding.we had a good laugh over the dessert: they had \"Burnt Cream.\" i called the waiter over. \u00a0\"isnt that basically Creme Brulee?\" He babbled about how its pretty much the same, but a slightly different recipe from some guy in Cambridge. blah blah blah, whatever. and you know what? it was creme brulee, no matter how he tried to spin it. and the service again was horrendous. when we wanted to pay and get the hell out of there, it took us ages for someone to take our money. we cleared everything on the table off to one side and placed the credit card on the other, spotlighted on its own. my BF even had a wave at the waitress of the next table over, she frowned and walked away. we were considering taking it as a sign that our meal was free and walking out when finally our waiter came over with a machine.HIGH NOTE THOUGH: their white table bread is freaking out of this world. amazing. best ive ever had. like we were full of our main dishes but ate more bread. and we both generally avoid all the unneeded \u00a0carbs.",

    "text": "One of my favourite places to go in East London for breakfast, the Albion is a large, upmarket cafe set in The Boundary building. Conceived as a bit of a Shoreditch House but without the membership code, it's usual to expect a 10 - 15 minute queue for a table if you go at any peak eating times. On my first visit I had a full breakfast which I didn't think was that great, but I've since discovered their breakfast baps. Bacon, egg and sausage is crammed into a freshly cooked bap which will fill you up completely for the tasty sum of \u00a34.50. Much better value than the breakfast. I've also tried their chicken rolls and smoked salmon & cream cheese sandwiches. Both are massive and very yum.",

    "text": "This review is for the bakery.And it's just not very good. Which is odd, because it has moments approaching brilliance. The almond paste in the croissant is to die for - thick and luscious - but the actual pastry is terrible! Slack, doughy, and often burnt, it's nearly inedible and nothing like a croissant - I cannot believe a French chef would turn this out. The macaroons taste amazing, but there's no gloss on them and the texture's wrong. The salted caramel tart is delicious, but again the pastry is undercooked. Even the carrot cake tasted initially incredibly then left a strange sickly after-taste. Flapjacks and brownies are okay, but not as good as they look, and many things are over-priced. I've eaten through all the sandwiches and salads, which are fine, though far too much bread to the meagre amount of filling. The bacon sandwich is just bad -a giant floury white bap, two thin greasy slices of bacon hiding in the middle. I did just have a delicious breakfast bun though. I love proper British bakeries and yet this just doesn't quite get there, for all its incredible looks. That said, I'll still go back as there's nothing quite like it in the area. The Modern Pantry, if you're Clerkenwell way, does delicious pastries Mon-Fri in its side shop.",

    "text": "I've had a lot of conversations with friends from foreign climes recently about the quality of British food, and they all seem to be of the same opinion- that it's horrible. The French ones guffaw at our battered sausage, the Spanish hoot about the greasy fry-ups, and don't get the Italians started on the greying pies they've spotted at their local chippy. They'll be eating their words once I introduce them to Albion, the latest Conran venture.The setting is fantastic, a little corner of Shoreditch with striped canopies and massive windows making this place look like a Parisian cafe. Inside there's a well stocked deli selling all sorts of cakes, sandwiches, groceries, cold meats and pates that had us drooling before we'd even sat down. Upon entering the main dining area we ordered a couple of pots of tea- which come with with knitted tea cosies, very in keeping with the current trend for war-time style knick-knacks and activities- and scanned the menu. It reads like a list of every great British dish, with gammon, egg and chips, whitebait, cauliflower cheese and much more to choose from. We both plumped for the Albion English Breakfast- It was a Sunday afternoon after all- and were greeted with a fantastic plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, black pudding, home-made baked beans, mushrooms and tomato. Every ingredient was top quality and perfectly cooked, and was served with home-baked bread and the saltiest butter I've ever had the pleasure of ingesting. Looking at other tables I caught glimpses of other dishes which looked fabulous and were being shovelled into contented looking faces at a rate of knots. Definitely one to take our foreign friends to to show that, when it's done well, British food is bang on.",

Snootiness aside, this is a great all-rounder location and perfect for folks who have to do work remotely: good, strong, delicious coffee, a good strong selection of coffee, and good strong wifi. For lunch and dinner, the menu isn't consistently tasty: some meals are simply better than other. Fish and Chips, excellent. Full English Breakfast excellent. I can't fault this though for being the ideal cafe to waste the day in: especially if you're one of those lucky, hip few that get to bag a people watching spot on the tables out front.",

    "text": "I'd heard about this place from a few people, and my boyfriend had been before with colleagues a couple of years back, and enjoyed it. So he suggested we go for Sunday lunch, on a particularly rainy Sunday - the sort which called for a pot of tea and a hearty meal. We braved the weather to get the cafe, only to find a massive queue. We decided to wait (who's in a hurry on a Sunday anyway?) and 35 minutes later we had a table. The dining room is one long, white bustle of tables, and the word to describe the style is \"cool and Conrad\". The service was decent enough, and the food was nice, but overall, it just didn't make me feel warm and fuzzy inside, as a Sunday lunch out should. Personally I wasn't in the mood for heavy dripping, pastry or chips, so I opted for the aubergine, courgette and chedder bake. Which was quite nice, but mostly it was \"meh\". My boyfriend had the full breakfast which actually looked much more intriguing, and he really liked it, so perhaps that's the one to go for. But I reckon there are plenty of better breakfasts out there, especially for ten quid. Food orders aside, though, I think the overall atmosphere is what lets Albion down. By the time we laid down our cutlery there was still a huge queue standing and watching everyone eat with impatient longing. The room lacked the warmth and lanquidity of a mellow Sunday afternoon, instead feeling more like a post office with a kitchen. We spent more time in the queue for a table than we did at the actual table. We decided to skip the pot of tea and go somewhere else, where we could take our sweet time with it. The bakery shop at the front of the cafe, with its amazing products, seems like the better, more enticing aspect of Albion. I wasn't really blown away by the sit down meal. To sum up, it was good, but it wasn't great.",

My friend had a shepherds pie and we each had red wine to boot.\u00a39.25 and \u00a311.00 respectively, well, alright the portion sizes were quite large, but still a bit pricey for somewhere that acknowledges they're a caff providing ''nothing challenging or complicated, just straightforward hearty ingredients and recipes''We both found the restaurnt got quite hot where we were sitting and as soon as we finished eating, moved to a table outdoors to finish our drinks and breathe more easily. Perhaps the heat is due to the open kitchen or maybe it was just a particularly busy Sunday afternoon?Anyway, I enjoyed seeing the rest of the Boundary complex - Terrance Conran's boutique hotel - the roof terrace ia lovely for drinks with views over the East End and the 'posher' restaurant downstairs looks luxe. We also liked the shop where you can buy deli items and fancy-schmancy stuff like overpriced oraganic milk and cordials while some of their baked-on-premises buns and flapjacks etc were pretty cheap by comparison. I'd probably go back to Albion again - when I'm feeling flush.",

    "text": "Recently opened, the Albion is Terence Conran's cafeteria styled restaurant on the ground floor of his Boundary hotel project in Shoreditch. The front of the restaurant is a food market/bakery, with open air kitchen and dining area tucked behind. Three of us dropped in on a Saturday night, between various pubs and lounges, and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. They do not accept reservations, strictly first come first serve. We were more than happy to wile away the time by getting drinks at the bar attached to the fancy French restaurant downstairs. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. We enjoyed our killer cocktails (well mixed and tasty) in the lush, though small, basement bar and were seated back upstairs in the Albion in no time. The Albion has a very warm, relaxed and unpretentious feel to it. The space is anything but claustrophobic with high ceilings and huge windows. There are some touches of the old character of the building remaining, including exposed brick walls and some elements added that respect its industrial heritage such as the lighting and floors. The food was simple and delicious. I had Welsh rabbit and a chicken pie; both exceeded my expectations. The chicken pie was quite large and they were very generous with the chicken. The baked crust was perfectly flaky. The breakfast menu looked excellent as well; we're already planning a return visit for a long lazy brunch. I wouldn't recommend it as an \u00fcber romantic spot (try the restaurant downstairs for that!), but it's a fantastic place for a relaxing meal and conversation with friends.",

This time, though - the croissants were not on offer - just as well, as it gave me a chance to order something new. My friend had a rather more conventional perfect cheese omelette and excellent chips (I was naturally forced to sample a couple while I waited for my food to arrive). And when it did - heaven. A bread and butter pudding I can only describe as ethereal, sizzling away in a satisfyingly large dish. No idea how they managed to get the custard so light - and the fruit bread so crunchy on top - anyway, I scraped the dish and can't wait to go back and have it again. I'm sure the main courses are all lovely but right now, I can't see beyond that pudding.",

It's hard not to compare the two, and I'll definitely have to come back here to try a few more of the dishes before making a final decision, but so far, st. Johns comes out on top. Though I will say, the bread and coffee I had were both fantastic. I also ordered a steak and kidney pudding. My first really. It could have used more gravy and perhaps the crust could have been a bit less spoungy, but I have no basis for comparison. The food came out quite quickly.

Great atmosphere and the restaurant was located on a quiet little street without any tourists (well, except us that night). Service was good and friendly. One of the colleagues wanted a salad but they were all out, so the chef created something for her from the last bit of veggies they had left upon request.

Not content with singularly homogenising the aesthetic of Britain's interiors with that bastion of modern design, Habitat, Sir Terence Conran has only gone and opened a restaurant slash hotel slash cafe on the site of Victorian London's most notorious slum and in the process likely pushed my rent up by a good 30%.Sure, I thought, it'll be grand being able to get a good coffee not twenty yards from home. That is if I can still afford a humble brew twelve months from now when those who formerly patronised Conran's bastion of pedestrian Sloaniness, The Bluebird Cafe, have treated The Boundary's opening as some kind of gateway drug to residing in formerly run down and out Shoreditch.Gripes aside, Albion does look very pretty. Lending Boundary Street a chic air and some much needed outdoor seating. Gripes back on the agenda: the service is not great. OK, I've only been to Albion for coffee, juice, etc and I understand my experience might have been elevated from the mediocre had I tried some food but Albion really is let down by its disinterested if sweet service staff. Oh, and the uniforms, as if it were actually possible, render the service staff even more invisible. Greige jackets a la H&M circa 2002? I think not.

    "text": "Albion @ The Boundary Project(Pics at The London Foodie)I had meant to come to Conran's new eatery since Time Out awarded it 2009's \"Best Cheap Eats\" in London but only made it with Dr G nearly a year later, for a late brunch last Saturday.I was impressed by the understated elegance of the building and d\u00e9cor - as a former light industrial building, some of its interesting features were maintained (or sympathetically incorporated) like the refectory style cream tiles, the factory lights, and the large windows which let plenty of natural light into the Caf\u00e9.I also loved their food shop and open plan kitchen - the large baskets of fresh bread, cleverly positioned at the entrance of the building, welcome you into the Caf\u00e9 and help to draw in even the most reluctant of punters.The menu is reassuringly simple with some British classics and \"caff\" style dishes that will appeal to anyone. Prices are not bad either with most dishes costing less than the \u00a310 mark.I was pleased to see Greenwich Meantime beers on their menu @ \u00a33.75, one of my favourite brewers in the country. I was lucky to attend a private tasting by this fantastic, \u00a0independent beer house a couple of years ago, and was completely stunned by the quality of their beers and the passion of the founder/speaker. I always order GM beers whenever I see them available, my favourites being London Porter, Union and the coffee beer.Dr G and I ordered a couple of staple dishes - I went for the \"Full Albion Breakfast\" @ \u00a39.75 while Dr G had \"Kedgeree\" @ \u00a39.50.I would have liked to continue the complimentary tone of my review and say that our food was as great as the d\u00e9cor, food shop, and beers, but unfortunately both dishes were rather disappointing.My breakfast looked great but did not taste it - the saving grace was the streaky bacon which was delicious, and the perfectly cooked eggs. With the exception of the baked beans, which were in fact not properly baked, and were very hard and nearly inedible, everything else was just passable.Dr G's kedgeree was an interesting choice - I cook kedgeree at home sometimes (one of my favourite brunch dishes) but had never seen a version like Albion's before. It was not a kedgeree, it was a risotto style dish made with basmati rice and cream. It had no discernible pieces of fish, be it smoked haddock or salmon - the fish had been I guess \"pulverized\" as there were no \"flakes\" to be seen. It was basically a fishy rice dish with cream, and was seriously lacking in seasoning. After the beautiful d\u00e9cor, the lovely bread, the charming service, expectations were high - I was gutted.As I waited for my food to arrive, I envisaged bringing some of my overseas friends and relatives who normally visit me in London for a taste of British cuisine - but judging by these two dishes, I would rather take them elsewhere. Tom of TomEatsJenCooks recommends The Modern Pantry when entertaining visitors from outside London for both a good brunch and the wow factor, but I still have to try this Clerkenwell place. I will report back as soon as I do.The total bill was \u00a330 for two, including 12.5% service. This is not bad (\u00a315 = main + beer) although for once I will have to disagree with Time Out as I can think of quite a few places where my 15 quid would be better spent.Verdict - Another classic example of style over substance - great d\u00e9cor, efficient staff, gorgeous looking food shop but seriously mediocre food. A possible Shoreditch choice for tea, cakes, or Greenwich Meantime beer.",

GO GO GO! MOVE! NOW! BUNS ON THE MOVE!! And subsequently shove one in my face, two in my purse, and five in a box for my flatmates. There must be some British crack involved in these buns (as is often the case...) because I just can't get enough!Freddie J recommended this warehouse turned British-culinary church of delicious and we sat for a light lunch in the cafe area. The highlight of our time together was a most adorable tea cozy that was literally a knitted tea-pot shaped jumper. Although my sandwich was attacked by mayo, which I despise, it was still gone in 60 seconds due to the speciality cheese involved. Perfect for a light lunch with a friend or a 1-man work party, (free wireless = gold) The Albion is definitely something you will be hearing much more of, be it by press, foodies, or friends with their mouths full of buns.",

There are home made classic cakes like Battenburg, Victoria Sponge and Bourbon biscuits on offer, it all made me very happy. Beyond being a pseudo bakery The Albion stocks an amazing array of jar'd pickles, mustards and all types of wondrous things. The Albion although excelling as a traditional bakery with extras, is a British restaurant selling darn good British tucker. There were four of us dining in the open kitchen, simply but stylishly decorated restaurant. We all had different dishes and each one was superb. I had a Chicken & Crayfish pie with a side of Beef Dripping Chips. It was so good. I also devoured the cauliflower cheese, numerous rounds of bread and munched my way through much of my colleagues' plates. The Albion is a great restaurant of which I would certainly recommend trying for lunch. The prices are at the high end of reasonable but well worth it.",

No, that was not what happened because both people who were sat after me (both solo diners) both received their food before me. Actually going to downgrade this to a 2. I ordered a cup of coffee and the full breakfast. I am actually sitting here and waiting for them to bring bread for my now cold eggs. \u00a0Now I have the bread. Good lord the eggs are actually inedible. I would tell the server this rather than a yelp review if they bothered to stop by and ask. How does a restaurant do bad eggs? It's the first dish a child learns to make? Sadly will not be back - this was a mistake of me judging a book by its cover. The cover was super shiny but the substance (and food) was severely lacking. The only thing nice I have to say about the place is that the coffee was good. \u00a0Okay downgrading to a single star.",

I have been four or five times always for breakfast/brunch but this morning's jaunt there was the first to propel me to put pen to paper, well, finger to keyboard. It's a great setting and certainly has a vibe, and the food is OK (not fantastic), although have to say this morning's coffees (flat white) were really poor - the sort of thing you'd get in a chain restaurant and served way, way too hot, and weak. As it had taken an age to get them, and I was gagging for caffeine, so I slurped mine down rather than sending it back. But it's just the general level of service that lets this place down. Lots of brown-jacketed wait staff running hither and thither, all studiously avoiding eye contact and looking miserable. Trying to get the bill was another effort - had to ask for it 3 times from the same waitress. (It was a Sunday morning and yes they did get very busy, but I was there before the rush). Will I go back? Yes, probably, because, hey I'm English and we whine a lot, and it's the kind of place you hope against hope that there will be a great experience the next time, and if everything came together it would be. I kind of fantasise about hanging out here, fab coffee, stack of papers, answering a few emails, sun streaming in.... But, I see there is a review here from Dec 09 also complaining about service so no one from the management has looked here and done anything about it. So we'll see. I'm not holding my breath. Vibe/atmosphere 4 stars; food/drink 3 stars; service 1 star.",

    "text": "Great little restaurant if you're looking for a cheap(ish) eat and good ambience. Came here with 2 friends and we sat at the communal table next to the open kitchen. The bread is sliced to order and really good, soft in the middle and crusty on the outside. They bake it fresh every day. We had to share our enormous plate of butter with the 2 sets of guys sitting next to us, which actually was kind of fun in a way. The fish and chips are quite good - the batter wasn't too heavy, just the perfect amount of crispiness and density, and the fish itself tasted fresh and was quite flavorful. We also shared the chicken and crayfish pie which was actually very light and not super rich, and had a delicate pastry crust which we eagerly plunged into. The lamb chop was slightly disappointing. A friend ordered it medium and it came to our table almost rare. I don't mind rare-ish meat, but I'm assuming if you do mind, then it can be quite unsavory. She sent it back and they re-grilled it, but she had to wait 15 minutes or so. It was also very thin, probably a cheap cut off the leg, but then of course, you're only paying for a cheap cut so why would they give you anything better? All in all, this a good place to dine - decent food, especially with a group of friends, and especially for those on a budget.",

The food is excellent, menu nice and varied and everything cooked to perfection. The little details of the retro coffee pots, knitted tea cosies and the whole blocks of butter on the table are kitsch as well as a little 'nostalgic' in some ways. But twice now I have felt very let down by bad service. The first time I went in November the waitress treated us like dirt. The place wasn't exactly busy either which I found a bit worrying. She took a long time to ask us what we wanted and seemed to have an edge of high arrogance about her. On my second visit we were seated and then promptly ignored by the staff. No menus or offer of a drink. When we eventually did some to order a pot of tea it came with no tea cosy and again very grotty service. It felt like literally ordering some tea and a full English was asking the staff to go out in a field and milk a cow for our tea and then come bearing our breakfast on a gold leaf platter followed by them individually peeling each grape we might like. That wasn't the case. I repeat my point but I do feel that literally asking for a pot of tea and a full English isn't asking too much as it is on the menu. My companion asked for some extra toast and you might have thought that we had asked her to do some performative dance or something along those lines. The face wasn't cheerful to say the least. Albion has great stuff in there, but I am bitterly disappointed to go there for awful service. I know its Shoreditch but it really should drop the attitude as I feel it lets the place down. Living just 5 minutes from there I know full well there are places that are capable of being lovely as well as a little trendy, minus the attitude.",

I was impressed by the understated elegance of the building and d\u00e9cor \u00a0as a former light industrial building, some of its interesting features were maintained (or sympathetically incorporated) like the refectory style cream tiles, the factory lights, and the large windows which let plenty of natural light into the Caf\u00e9. I also loved their food shop and open plan kitchen \u00a0the large baskets of fresh bread, cleverly positioned at the entrance of the building, welcome you into the Caf\u00e9 and help to draw in even the most reluctant of punters. The menu is reassuringly simple with some British classics and caff style dishes that will appeal to anyone. Prices are not bad either with most dishes costing less than the \u00a310 mark. I was pleased to see Greenwich Meantime beers on their menu @ \u00a33.75, one of my favourite brewers in the country. I was lucky to attend a private tasting by this fantastic, independent beer house a couple of years ago, and was completely stunned by the quality of their beers and the passion of the founder/speaker. I always order GM beers whenever I see them available, my favourites being London Porter, Union and the coffee beer. Dr G and I ordered a couple of staple dishes \u00a0I went for the Full Albion Breakfast \u00a39.75 while Dr G had Kedgeree \u00a39.50.

The menu was a little fish-heavy, but a couple delightful vegetarian options (the aforementioned squash). It was also excellent for people-watching. I wish I could've eaten everything in the attached shop. They really prove that proper British food CAN be delicious!",

It must be that they are really badly managed, as I can't imagine any other way that you would get that many people who cannot function in one team. The Matre D is horrible to them. I've seen the way he speaks to them and its not pretty! So in a way, I feel sorry for them, but not enough! If your job is to provide customer service, then you should do that or move on! Such a pity as the food is good, if a little over priced and the surroundings are lovely.",

The sun was shining. \u00a0There were beautiful people all around us. \u00a0It was good.We topped it off with a look at the grill on the roof. \u00a0As soon as it is sunny I shall see if I can get a long term lease there. \u00a0It looks amazing.",

    "text": "I've been to Albion before for breakfast, and my time back then was quite enjoyable. I think their breakfast, fresh breads and baked goods are the best thing about this place.Unfortunately, I recently went back for lunch with some friends and discovered how unfortunate you must be to come to this place expecting a decent lunch experience. The food was not satisfactory, however that was the least of the problems here.The real reason why Albion gets one star is because of the service. Mind you, the experience gave me and my friends a good laugh, but that entertainment value quickly died when we had to pay for the absurdity they like to call service.First off, our server wasn't helpful with the menu. When we asked him which dish he preferred between the two we picked, he casually mentioned that one was vegetarian and the other had meat. I did not learn anything new from that insight...Once we all picked our dishes, our server went off to do his thing elsewhere. The entertainment commenced once more about 20 minutes later when we finally received our dishes. The server returned and sternly told us \"you guys are now complete, yeah?\" Sure thing, except we didn't have the adequate cutlery to enjoy our meal.One of my friends requested a spoon so she could eat her dish. The server went away and, a few minutes later, returned with a large dinner plate. He hovered it above our heads. We weren't sure what to make if it until he said \"just take the spoon.\" The hilarity ensued as the luncheon dragged on and we were requesting for more drinks. Our server had a penchant for keeping his gaze away from us and standing idly by the window, presumably waxing philosophically about something.The icing on the cake was when we requested the bill. He told us he would clear our table and bring it to us. Taking only two plates, he went to the back of the kitchen, never to return again...Our table was still filled with empty plates, and a manager finally gave us the key to our freedom. We paid the service for two reasons. As a fellow server, I understand what not getting service feels like. But, the real reason is for the entertainment value our server offered. His comical style was second to none and I honestly believe Albion should increase the service from 12.5 to 25 percent.Just kidding! In all seriousness though, don't go there...",

I don't know what they put in the eggs (maybe cream, maybe crack?) but they were insanely delicious. \u00a0We ordered a side of cheese cauliflower and it did not disappoint. \u00a0Service was slighly off--I think it is because we were at the end of the long alley, so it doesn't really work for the waiters to flow down there to be able to check in. \u00a0The only problem is that I wanted to eat so much there--next time I will be taking a to-go bag home with a sticky bun and a cupcake.",

We sat at a wooden communal table and were surrounded by lots of lovely people who were all catching up and looking for a delicious brunch just as we were.On our way out, we couldn't help but grab a loaf of bread to-go.

One of the options was poached eggs with sweet potato hash which sounded divine. It sounded so delicious that my non-gluten-free friend also opted for it and it was delicious. The eggs were cooked to perfection and were a wonderful deep orange colour highlighting their quality. The sweet potato was delicious and helped set me up for the day.

    "text": "How have I not reviewed the Albion?! I've been here like 18 times. The Albion is a funny one, it's like that ex you keep going back to because you're too lazy to find someone new. Whenever I need to take someone to a breakfast place and my steadfast favourites are busy, I drag them to the Albion. But I'm not crazy about their breakfast, they have big jumbo sausage sandwiches and English breakfasts. However, I don't always want that much grease on my plate, so I order granola and toast. Their toast basket does come with great slices of doorstop bread and a butter dish that you can just slather on and not worry about anyone judging you. My friend did order eggs on toast and got one egg on a slice of toast for about 6 quid. Errr....And for lunch, I've ordered the huge doorstop sandwiches and cauliflower cheese. I think this place might be great and I just don't get it because I can't really fit that much stodgy carbs in my tummy. It's proper British food, comfort favourites that I adore \u00a0and ones my dad would like, mackerel, kippers, etc. If you have visitors from out of town that you want to take to a beautiful, light-filled restaurant that serves classic dishes, then this is the one! And for dinner, well I've cracked it on the dinner front. Just order mains and a dessert and you won't get the stodge-overload. I had the chicken and leek pie and it was flaky pastry perfection. We ordered a side of cauliflower cheese and dripping chips and struggled to finish them. Albion, I think we will forever have this crazy relationship. And I'll keep coming back. I just can't quit you.",

I had a scone and a juice, which is perhaps not the most representative sample of their fares, but both were pretty good, and it was a reserved and healthy breakfast, so I can't complain. The juice I had was a bit odd, very heavy on ginger I think, and left me a bit puckered after. The noise is quite loud, both in the restaurant and out on the street, though it's nice how open the place is on a warm day. There are long tables and small tables, good for intimate brunch, or a team meeting like I had.It is a nice location, just a few short minutes from Shoreditch High Street station. The service was good, although not really in a rush, and the prices were a bit high. Overall, it was a nice enough place... I'd be persuaded to head back for a proper brunch some day.",

Delicious fish and chips and mixed sharing board! Get a beer or cider and you are set for the day.Only complaint was the very slow service. Although we were seated fairly quickly, everything after that seemed to take a long time. Our waitress was very sweet but I felt like we had to flag her down or signal to her everytime time we needed something, including just getting our order taken. Luckily we were not in a hurry and chalked it up to a service style that we were just not used to. Would still go back!",

Bought a visitor to London here to show it off but sadly the service was way off -- we did the standard wait to be seated thing, were at the front of the queue, saw some empty seats, lots of staff. Nobody even greeted or acknowledged us for about 5-10mins even though we were right by the til and staff thoroughfare and they all walked straight past with no smiles or even a 'someone will be with you shortly'. We had to ask if the system had changed and we can just go sit on the empty seats to get served... to which the staff member said a waitress will come get us... tick tock. Embarrassing as had just talked the place up. Got sat. Took a while to place order.Luckily the food here was still good so can't fault the kitchen!! Coffee was terrible though.Took forever to get someone's attention for the bill, which was odd as there was a queue so you'd think they would try and clear our dirty plates and give us the bill.What's happened Albion?! New management or something?? Def won't be coming back in a hurry.Such a shame about the service.",

The rognons (kidneys) were perfection incarnate, slightly smoky and perfectly cooked. \u00a0My dining partners loved the fish and chips; and the giant chocolate chip cookie at the end \u00a0was \u00a0breathtaking. \u00a0Cut to 2018-- Easter Sunday. \u00a0This time, we trekked to Albion on our last day in London, and really wish we hadn't. \u00a0The restaurant was quiet (it was around 6pm). \u00a0The staff was inept (\"It's my first day,\" said our waitress). \u00a0The problem wasn't that she didn't know the menu to answer basic questions (\"how is the calf-liver cooked?\"); SHE DID NOT SPEAK ENGLISH!!!! \u00a0I had to write out our order (yes, MOI, the diner). \u00a0The food was stale, abysmal, and seemed warmed over-- even the once fabled chips (fries). \u00a0And the chocolate chip cookie was still giant-- just stale, hard, and better as a ping-pong bat. \u00a0We were terribly disappointed and wish we'd headed instead to Dishoom across the street --it's another old fave that just keeps getting better). So, Albion: get over your laurels. \u00a0This meal was really worse than anything served at a \u00a0backwaters airport at 2am. \u00a0Get your staff an English lesson; teach them your menu (it's only 6 items for dinner, if I recall!); source \u00a0those fresh ingredients; and for heaven's sake, \u00a0redeem your pride if your clients are ever to return. \u00a0This one will surely not!This was a truly abysmal meal on every front. NOTHING redeemed it, alas.",

The grocery/bakery portion of the restaurant is only as big as a kitchen but every product is top notch.We stopped by between the awkward late lunch/early dinner hour. Luckily for us, the bakery was still stocked full. I decided to buy some dessert for later- a giant cookie (the size of a plate) and Queen Victoria Sponge Cake. I was craving scones and the cake was the closest thing to it complete with jam and cream. I grabbed a bunch of Prestat chocolate bars as well. My cousins bought dinner groceries. Fancy pork chops it was for them. Btw, the meat and poultry here is all organic.If you are into food, this is a great shop to browse as they have a lot of specialty and local items. The only thing that shies it away from a 5 star experience are the tiny flies that buzz around the baked goods not covered by glass.",

    "text": "I've now been here 3x. It's a solid 3.5-4 stars, but based on the sandwich value I'm going to round up... Sandwiches: Basically for the price of 1 sandwich (6.95) you get 2 sandwiches. Literally, 4 slices of bread and each an individual large sandwich. I thought it might be a mistake the first time (salmon/cream cheese) but I got the tomato and cheddar last night in the same formation. It's quite a deal, especially if you are hungry. The service is always a bit lethargic. The menu lacks descriptions -- none of the menu items has any indication of what it might be, might come with, or any details. I guess do your best? This seems like it might be an easy fix, especially when some of the items are quite foreign, even to my British dining companion. Pssst, Kedegree is a beautiful thing, just for the record. It's caught somewhere between \"nice restaurant\" and \"cafe style.\" It's got a relaxed vibe and there are always mountains of pastries and cookies and pies flowing out from the large kitchen. It's almost as if its a large commercial bakery with a restaurant sat in front of it. A row of outside tables for when the sun may be shining, and a sweet little market with plenty of great \"quick\" takeaways, ingredients, vegetables, fruits and other delicacies. It won't come cheap, but really -- what does? They have Fentiman's Lemonade, so my life was happy. All in all, I suggest it more for a breakfast or lunch and elsewhere for dinner (the menu doesn't really change regardless) -- but a solid spot with some promise shown. If they spiffed the menu a bit and put some pep in their step, this place could be shiny.",

    "text": "I stumbled upon this place after a Sunday evening movie at the Electric Cinema on Redchurch Street. We wanted to grab a bite afterward, and unfortunately as it was a Sunday, there weren't too many options available. I have heard great things about the brunch here, but had never considered it for dinner. After a brief look at the menu, we agreed to dine here simply because we were starving.We got the cheese straws to start and I ordered the half pint of prawns, while my friend got the roast venison. He asked the waitress if that was enough food, and she said the venison didn't come with much, so he ordered chips as well, but when the food came it was definitely too much with the chips. The venison was beautifully pink and came with a large pile of roasted root vegetables.The cheese straws were delicious and had a great herb mix in them, and also came served in a little mountain of at least 15. My prawns were pretty disappointing, as they were quite small, and the restaurant didn't have cocktail sauce available so I passed on the mayo and settled on dipping it in lemon juice. i definitely wouldn't recommend them. I had the same dish at The Well in Clerkenwell and I found that far superior.I didn't particularly enjoy my experience here, but from what I'm told, brunch is the star of the show (and attracts long queues), so that could be a reason for a return trip.",

Had a lovely juice, coffee, fruit salad and sausage sandwich but the service is inattentive though polite.",

What I loved most however about the meal were the chips - chunky, with the skin still on, and - I believe - cooked in the oven. You might guess that the chips had something to do with me not finishing off the sandwich - yup, I guess you're right! But: have a look at the other sandwich half I took home with me - this is definitely not for beginners!To round off the meal I had a glass of ros\u00e9 wine which was lovely.I have not seen much of the interior, although passing through on my way to the bathroom I did observe the place and found it to be very nicely done, with white being the dominating colour, and lots of food on display, as the Albion serves as a bakery, too. I could have purchased bread, danish and lots of cake on the spot, it all looked so delicious. Surely one of the most popular spots in Shoreditch, and rightly so.",

    "text": "In a Nutshell: A trendy resto in a very trendy area that surprisingly delivers on food quality (and top-notch people watching).There's the Boundary Hotel and its posh Rooftop Bar above...and Shoreditch House across the street. \u00a0I was a tad nervous that I'd get stuck in some overly pretentious East End douchery at the Albion, but the ambience (though still very much hip) struck the right balance. \u00a0My fellow photographer friend and I were lucky to snag al fresco lunchtime seats (it gets busy around here) and the proximity to all the street activity and passerby fashions on Boundary/Redchurch street was worth the price in itself. On to the food: The menu is very British, and dishes were listed with minimal description. \u00a0That made me a tad nervous. \u00a0My recommendation is to ask your waiter what they'd recommend, for the \"Rabbit in Mustard Cream\" wouldn't have been my first choice...but dammit it was good. \u00a0The actual presentation of the meal was tremendously more attractive than the terse text on the menu. \u00a0It would be the best rabbit dish I've ever tasted (others have been too gamey for my preference), and the mustard cream was well-balanced, appeasing my fears of a tangy onslaught all over the meat. \u00a0 For dessert we split a rhubarb crumble, which came with a lovely warmed custard to help neuter the sweet punch of the rhubarb flavor. \u00a0Add to the mix good tea, affordable wine and unfussy service, and you have one of my more delightful restaurant experiences in London of the summer.The Albion may just have converted this reluctant American into liking British fare.Golden Tip: Come early, and if you can get a seat outside (especially when the weather is excellent) DO SO.",

You'd be mistaken to think this East London gem is just for locals, or would do terribly fancy breakfast foods you've never heard of before. What Albion do best are the classics. Their sausage baps are on point, with the much loved additions like a drippy fried egg, bacon, the works. Being a Yorkshire lass, I was skeptical as I looked over the menu. Sausage bap, you say? I'm going to judge you heavily on how well you do this. Gotta say, in addition to the friendly staff, delicious coffee and reasonably priced options; they really smashed it out the park with my favorite breakfast treat. Not a chewy bit to be found, the sausages were perfectly cooked and well seasoned - really need to find out where they source them from and stock up my fridge at home. Nothern or not, if you're missing classic, amazingly done and decent sized portions you should really add this place to your list of regular breakfast spots. You'll find them tucked behind Shoreditch House, just opposite the overground and next to A.P.C - perfect for some post-food shopping. Albion, I love you.",
