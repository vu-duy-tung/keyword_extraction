They also have a great old school Hollywood movie thing going on in the new basement and loads of vintage car stuff everywhere. It all goes well with an unusual mix of old school Blues, hip hop, classical and even some very old country music! Anyone would love it here. It somehow makes me want to go to the deep south and do something exciting.My best part? The staff and they're lack of exclusivity. Oh, and the coffee is better then ever. They use English roasters to keep is local .And the basement cinema is rare.And the European mix.And the staff are rare.love it.",

Quick visit to Greensmiths made this visit a little slice of perfection for our late lunch/dinner between classes.I've been here a few times since, and the coffee and staff/customer friendliness has remained consistent each visit.

No, the kicker with this great little haunt is that it's a rickety shambles of a place that seemingly has some kind of tractor beam installed in it, meaning that, should you pop in for a hot drink, there's a very good chance you'll never ever leave. It's a cosy place alright with a friendly mix of people all loafing around and trying to attract the attentions of the most aloof cats I've ever met. Yep. This cafe has cats mooching about the place ignoring absolutely everyone in there and, of course, if you're a cat person like me, this makes them even more irresistible and you split your time evenly between grinning to yourself, admiring the clutter that adorns the walls and wishing the felines would make friends with you for just one second. If you want something a bit stronger than the hot drinks, they sell beers and spirits as well, which makes this one of the best places I visited in London. It's a pretty unassuming place, but it is well worth popping in. Just don't tell too many people. You'll want to keep this all for yourself.",

It's full of transport related objects and generally old artefacts; there are also at least three cats hiding in and around the place. I love it here. However, there are a couple of bad bits standing in the way of the big five. For all the quirks and old stuff, what also comes with that is a little bit of grime and only two comfy chairs.

They have Vespa and scooter goodies all over the place (their original raison d'etre) and great reading material scattered about. When you're finished with the reading material and people watching watch the barista and you'll be amazed at how she/he prepares everything in a tiny ships galley like space! Pure theatre, I think. In the lovely Lower Marsh area this is certainly one to try. Finally - they serve beers alongside their other hot drinks - which is a bonus for some.",

When it first opened and was more of Scooter repair place than a coffee shop i used to walk past and think, that looks cool but was too chicken to go in. Then chairs started to appear and people were more visibly sitting and talking with drinks inside. The coffee is absolutely the best in the area. The atmosphere is super chilled, like walking in to 1967 complete with mismatched furniture, games in the corner and cats wandering about. The new downstairs is a great addition as it was beginning to become difficult to get a seat in there! I remember when the downstairs was still in progress though and i had to go to the loo once in a place with no walls! Absolutely hilarious. I've been here for meetings in the day and on dates and with friends in the evenings. The wine is nice and well priced, two bottle beers available Corona and Morretti. Oh and there used to be some insanely beautiful twins who worked there. Tall and willowy and just beautiful. The staff are always dead friendly though, twins or no twins.",

She ended up having the greatest hot chocolate ever!!!I think my neck touched the curtains, and that gave me a rash! But then, I am just hypersensitive.YES, I loved this place. Every time I visit London, ScooterCaffe is going to be on the top of the things to do list.",

You can bring your own food. They show free films downstairs on Monday nights and have a supply of board games. Downstairs is also available to hire for private parties. The prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is unlike anywhere else, a real vintage gem.",

As long as it's a low-key first date. People watching was fabulous, the staff were super friendly to everyone, including a homeless man who came in for a tea and kept talking to them during busy spells.The only thing is, I was a bit worried about the surrounding area, considering we left at about 10 PM but turned out to be fine.

Came here yesterday morning with 2 friends for a quick catch up. Caffe was already busy with young mums and dads and their buggies. We managed to squeeze ourselves into a corner and it was well worth it. Awesome coffees from the Faema professional barista machine (rare to find in the UK). Cat lovers will adore their experience here where a moggy roams free amongst the customers!! Curiously, little to no food on offer apart from biscoti. I was advised by the friendly waitress to nip out to near by shops to get pastries which I did from Greggs and Green(??? can't remember the rest of the name) down the road. Hey, may be someone (me, even!) should offer to make snacks for them to sell in the caffe!!! Cup cakes come to mind :o) I cannot wait to go back there for drinks in the evening. Such a terrific place to hang out at and it is independent too!",

There used to be a scooterworkshop here, now there's not but it's still fun!Cats! Anywhere can be vastly improved with the addition of a purry kitty. Well this place has four, I think. The tips go to the food fund. CutenessThe events. Live mic nights, SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS and other things of awesome.You can take your own lunch in. They ask you to take your rubbish though. Nice.Free wifi! Yay! See? Moving in.Cute boys! Very cute boys. Everywhere. Staff, punters, scooter cat loving boys. See? There's nothing I don't like about this place.

Its decor includes the eponymous scooter in the window, a table that looks like a piece of old sewing equipment, a shelf of board games, a small rear garden and (best of all) a black and white cat. It's a great place to relax during the afternoon over a drink and have a chat with a friend or for a more intimate drinking hole in the evening. There's not a lot of selection for beers and wines but they have a lot of hard liquor. The beer and wine isn't badly priced. It's also great for a coffee or tea. The atmosphere just makes me feel relaxed and content.",

    "text": "The Scooter Works bar and cafe, just behind Waterloo station is my newest discovery. It is an absolute delight. I was taken by a friend of mine who has been coming here for 4 years, and is always happy when she misses her train at Waterloo because it means that she can come here instead. The idea behind this small little room is that is emulates a 50's Italian coffee shop where the twin passions are good quality espressos and...scooters! So there are a couple of scooters nonchalantly parked next to the till, along with a smattering of Italian records thrown around for good measure. Played wrong, this could end up looking a little contrived, but this place really works. It helps that the coffee is sublime, easily on par with the Monmouth coffee company. It also helps that the staff have an authentic 50's Milanese coffee machine to work with. The menu is tiny, written on the back of a postcard. I ordered the hot chocolate which was like nothing I had drank before. It took about 5 minutes to make and then I drank it in 10 seconds. It is more like melted dark chocolate. I wanted to order the white chocolate with nutmeg, which apparently tastes like thick custard, but was told that this flavour had sold out, and when they sell out, someone has to go back to Italy to get the ingredients. I guess I will just have to hang around until they get it back in.",

Positives: Really friendly and warm service, cat that treats the entire cafe like his living room, excellent cocktails and lots of seating downstairs when it's a bit full up top.Downsides: Doesn't get a lot of light in the daytime, so it feels a bit like a cave on sunnier days, though there is a small outdoor section in the back. Not a lot of food selections, however they allow you to bring in outside food. Highly recommend hitting up the Lower Marsh lunchtime market for yummy food (Hungarian sausage wraps, Cuban sandwiches, Jamaican jerk chicken) and bringing it in. Last, not as laptop friendly as Four Corners across the way.Overall, nice spot to come for cocktails in the evening, especially when it's late (like after seeing a play in the nearby Old Vic) and the neighbourhood is quiet.",

    "text": "Retro-trinkets, 1920s music, two cats and an English waitress quick to break into foreign accents and language. This is definitely my kinda place.The aspect I like most about ScooterCaffe was the gloriously escapist feel to it. The hint of this starts at the door: it's dimly lit inside, making it very difficult to see into the cafe from the outside. But enough is visible to stoke your curiosity. A Vespa scooter sits in the window with a cloth union jack flag draped over it. Next to it lie various faded bric-a-brac from yesteryear. Walking into the cafe reveals ScooterCaffe in its full retro glory. Rusty scooters against the walls. Tables covered in red and white checked table cloths. Walls plastered with old pictures and turn of the 20th century adverts. 1920s music playing in mono. So convincing was its effect that for a while, I felt like I'd wandered on to the set of a 1920s play.So, its retro-effect is pretty spell-binding. It's also got free wifi, a small space outside at the back and a large basement downstairs with more seating (though less retro-themed and more fairy lit). But a couple of things stop it from attaining 5 star status. The hot chocolate and brownie I had weren't exceptional, more edging towards the mediocre, which was disappointing given the stunning lead-up to them. If they can fix that (hint: source the brownies from market stall Galeto's. Job done. And look to French bakery Paul for pointers on how to make the best hot chocolate) then this place will be a shoe-in for 5 stars.",

I'm not sure if the coffee tops my favourite at Timberyard, but for a space to work with free wifi, a decent amount of power sockets, and a pretty relaxed atmosphere in the afternoon, it's great. And also has the resident cat so it balances out the not-as-good-as-Timberyard coffee.The first time I came here we ended up inadvertently sitting next to resident cat which was a great surprise! The girls who work here (as I've only seen women working here) are friendly and good at their jobs. The atmosphere is relaxed, with lots of strange stuff everywhere so cool space to look around. The music tends to be quite good and varied but not too loud which is great for both work and coffee-time chats. There's some outdoor space at the back as well which is good on sunny days, though I haven't been here during one of those rare London treats.It's taken me years to finally get myself to Scooter Caffe but now that I've been it's quickly becoming a favourite for relaxed afternoons getting work done and meeting up with friends.

If you're on the south bank, the BFI perhaps, tear yourself away from the tourist trap that it is and imagine you are in your very own Fellini film here at the Scooter Cafe. A cool artsy little cafe, with great espresso, but it'd be a real shame to grab a caffeine kick here and just knock one back and fly, instead have a Negroni, or two. Then enjoy the setting-at any time of day, if you need to do work, you could or you could kick back, forget whatever next is planned next get another Negroni, they are the best! N-E-G-R-O-N-I= yay! Worries, see ya! Deadlines, shmedlines. Oh and they also have cats. A dark and cosy spot, with a cute dingy little basement for after dark dalliances and more Negronis.",

Fortunately petting the kitty makes up for it. If you're looking for a snack, grab a Wagon Wheel! Yum!",

    "text": "This is a little place tucked away behind Waterloo Station. Upon first glance, it looks more like a little coffee shop where you can spend hours reading a book or writing your memoirs. And during the day, I wouldn't be surprised if that's exactly what it is.As night falls, it changes into a kitschy little bar with a full range of alcohols although I'd wager this is more for standard cocktails than any novel or innovative drinks due to the limited number of liqueurs and mixers. However, the drinks they do serve are impeccably made as evidenced by the very clean and crisp gin & tonics my friends ordered. I took a slightly different tack and ordered a double Laphroaig 10 year old whiskey neat. To my delight, and possibly the dismay of others, the smoky peaty smell spread over the whole bar hinting at a fresh bottle properly stored. D\u00e9cor wise, it kind of looks like someone raided a storage locker clear out sale with items that are most likely described as \"salvaged\" or \"reclaimed\". It's not my style and thus unlikely that I would opt to come back (I prefer clean lines, stone, metal, and glass in my bars) but my sister loved it. Each to their own I suppose.Prices are very reasonable sot that is a draw but be warned - there is space for maybe 12-15 people to sit and very little standing room. So while good for meeting a friend or two, any medium to large group is going to be sorely disappointed. An interesting stop on our way to Cubana and probably best kept that way.",

Lowlights:- The area that this is located in is currently under construction and the store front is blocked by construction fences, make it difficult to see / locate.Overall: A great place if you like exploring hole-in-the-wall places with a lot of character!",

With two resident cats, a fully stocked bar, lush coffee, and a chilled, unpretentious vibe, Scootercaffe highlights exactly what is missing from most coffee shops in London: atmosphere.Tips:- don't order a flat white here; they don't serve it (they do, however, serve a hot chocolate which you could stand a spoon in).- wine is only \u00a33.50 a glass- you are welcome to bring your own food although they serve a limited range of pastries- wifi is free; the password is stuck on the till- don't feed the kitties- do stroke the kitties (notice how I avoided the joke about stroking pussy...oh...wait)- the bathroom is frightening- watch your head on the light fittings- there's a patio out back* I may or may not be one of these people.",

First of all, I must add, that I like coffee quite a lot. I do however, adore cats. In the crazy cat lady way. So you could imagine my excitement whilst scouring yelp and finding this little gem. Anyway, I arrived and was greeted by two uber cool hipster ladies behind the counter who ushered me in to take a seat. They were really friendly and quickly took my order. I tried not to look too insane but immediately my cat-detector vision was reporting negative to felines in any proximity. As if to add insult to injury my coffee arrived and my latte art was a swirly blob. But the whole experience was saved, by the coffee being nice (not on par with others in London but certainly nice) and I found the furry friend. The Kitty was all snuggled on a chair downstairs (that I didn't know existed until I needed the loo), so I got to have a little tlc time with the cat which certainly made my day. Next time, I'll be back, but next time I'm bringing whiskas!",

It ended up with just me having a coffee and somehow managed to pick the table where the cat was fast asleep on a chair next to. Not deliberate, honest!Unfortunately, the milk in my coffee had taken a turn for the worst. Immediately realised it was sour. Took the coffee back up to the girl who served me, she apologised and said there had been problems with the milk before. She happily swapped the coffee for a lovely, refreshing Fentimans lemonade. The decor is scooter and vintage themed, very cool. They have a small terrace area at the back that looks like a little sun trap too. Lots of delicious looking cakes on the counter too.I would go back if I was in London, hope they can get the sour milk situation straightened out, it's a cool wee place.

Unique,cosy,quirky,chilled,interesting, a must visit!!",

Love this place it really has a uniqueness about it because it turns from one to another yet keeping elements of the bike shop within it. Good coffee but I usually come here for a beer or wine. Quirky chairs it's a cool place to stop off at if in area.",

I ordered a coffee while my friends both ordered tea, and we sat downstairs. We honestly lost track of time in the cafe, as the environment and vibe were really quite nice. Something in between hipster and comfortable. Really enjoyed this place and the coffee/tea were quite good, but not spectacular. Unfortunately the kitty was asleep during the time I was there, but seemed quite friendly. One of the finds on Yelp that I am most proud of. Definitely coming back if in the neighborhood.",

A great place to check out, you should definitely visit for the funky decor, endlessly tasteful and fantastic playlist of jazz music, and of course, for the adorable cat (who seems to be always sleeping). Will always pick this place to introduce to friends who think the lower marsh isn't cool enough.",

The staff were friendly and efficient and served us quickly despite how busy it was when we arrived.  It is very kitschy inside in a way that doesn't feel too forced. There isn't much in the way of food but the coffee was pretty good! \u00a0 It's quite small but has alcoholic options too so can take care of you from noon till night.",

There was a cute, sleepy cat guarding the bathroom in the basement as well as kitschy furniture decorating the place. I got a cider there, surprisingly a French cider, but it seems they have good coffee and cocktails as well. The beer selection didn't look promising at all, unfortunately. There's free wifi as well as a clean bathroom, so it's a nice place to stop by when you're tired. I saw quite a few people there alone, either reading or using their laptops, so you won't feel out of place if you do the same.",

Definitely not! The tables were cute, I guess, but not very functional. The loo is down a spiral staircase, with a broken railing, so be warned! This cafe is also famed for its resident cat, but even the cat was unfriendly. Disappointing.",
