Yes, there's the occasional drainpipe clad muso but, y'know you're right next to London Fields and Crackney Wick...residential meccas of the Hoxtonite. I don't find this pub to be pretentious, rather it's a nice converted old man boozer that now sells typical gastropub food in a predictable interior (big chunky wood tables, dark lighting and young staff). If it's a crime to have a pub serving decent grub and have a younger crowd then y'all must be miserable as hell.",

    "text": "Sitting in a pub mid week over a leisurely lunch is by far the cheekiest treat I've allowed myself of late. One I can't really afford it and two, I should be at the studio working. But it's a rare occasion that my friend is in this neck of the woods, the North South divide is alive and well and we had something to celebrate, an offer being made on her flat. It doesn't really matter where we go, we always have a giggle but this was particularly fun. We sat giving a running commentary of all the odds and sods in the bar, what a colourful crowd we are. I do really like this pub, it's calm and beautiful if just a little intimidating and I've gotten over the fear of bumping into my ex- she's back on the other side of the world, phew. So, what to have? With unnaturally high levels of indecision and a pounding head I went for the heartiest thing on the menu that weren't the faggots and ordered myself the belly of pork sandwich with whole grain mustard and watercress and yes, as you've offered, I'd love chips. But not verging on burnt and a little red sauce wouldn't go a miss. I'm no great meat eater but I hate to say my \u00a37 sarnie did taste a bit like the back end of a pig rather than it's belly and I was a bit miffed to see that I'd been charged extra for my chips when the bill came, I assumed that was part of the dish. The pub was pretty busy but still we held a big table to ourselves without anyone batting an eyelid. Really nice place but just a little up it's own behind if you know what I mean.",

Then the chef changed around 2006, around the time that Broadway Market was overun by Nathan Barley's from Hoxton Square and now its just full of style over content people that groom themselves to look like they have slept in a bush for the last week eating roast meat type nursery food whilst they ponder if moving here from Ladbrooke Grove was really the right thing to do, just because their friend Toby's dad bought a flat near the canal as an investment. We went here for dinner again recently, the gnocchi was solid and inedible and Suzi Quatro's Devil Gate Drive pumping out from the speakers made me want to stand on an antique piano stool dressed as a Chelsea Pensioner and throw up my own pelvis bone. It gets too busy too unless you go Monday-Thursday night.is this place a boozer or a restaurant??!!, I don't think it quiet knows, what I do know is that if you like eating sat next to someone who smells like a Sue Ryder shop but probably earns 75k a year for sitting in front of Quark all day then you'll love it. Service is erratic unless you have a 70's plastic jacket on and a goatee beard and a tattoo of a 'mystic' Hindu symbol on your lower left leg.",

The gastro menu changes daily and you are rarely disaapointed. There is a spiral staircase and opened an upstairs dining room, which is great as the weekends are so busy. Well worth a visit - nice, easy atmosphere and a cool east london crowd. You will often see the odd celeb having a beverage here. You have the tables and chairs outside and an awning so you don't have to worry about getting rained on if you smoke. You can also take youru dogs inside with you which is really lovely. The drinks can be a tad pricey but then you are in London are this pub is really lovely. Brick walls and old wooden tables and chairs. If you get the chance simply go!!",

    "text": "I live in Manchester so the Cat and Mutton is hardly a 'local' but I have friends who live nearby so if I'm down for the weekend and Saturday night creeps into Sunday lunchtime territory and the Holyoaks/Eastenders/Come Dine with Me omnibus's have finished the pull of a good Sunday Roast at the Cat & Mutton, before the arduous journey home, is enough to thrust me into mixing with people for a few hours. The pub itself has a semi rustic feel with differing sized tables and a big old bar, which for a short arse like me is not ideal, and although it is usually busy if you happen to go on a nice day, even in mid October, the crowd tend to spill out onto the street so you can often still get a table. Or share a table, you quite often find 2-3 people on a table of 8 but don't feel put off by asking to share. East London may be renowned for its 'Di**heads' but even they make for good table mates. It's a great pub for people watching. They have an upstairs area too which is sometimes overlooked, probably as the spiral staircase on a Sunday hangover is too much to attempt for someone in ridiculously skinny jeans. The food here is of a very good standard with big portions, slightly pricey, but probably not for this part of town. Roasts with all the trimmings will set you back \u00a315. They have the usual selection of gastro pub beers and ciders although running out of cider at 6pm on a Sunday was bad planning by someone. I haven't any cause to complain about the staff being rude or pretentious as I haven't experienced it. Whenever I've been in there's been quite a varied clientele and it is bustling. I find the atmosphere vibrant and it certainly perks me up for my long journey home.",

I like the East End, including Whitechapel, Bethnal Green and London Fields, so points for good surroundings, too.There was an odd mix of folks, but there was something for everyone, it seemed, including people, dogs, people with dogs, various dress-up birthday parties, dressed-down/casual tourist types like myself, and locals like our hosts.",

The staff are all really young - or perhaps I'm not - but sweet, and friendly and once they get the hang of not opening bottles of prosecco like they're weapons and almost taking patrons' eyes out, it will be perfect. Canap\u00e9s were great - sausages with mustard glaze; mini Welsh rarebits; bite-sized Yorkshire puddings with beef; asparagus spears in puff pastry. The mgmt recommended a great DJ too who played just the right mix of motown classics to keep things moving. Great location for a party - and if you want to continue on after they're shut, head down to their other pub, the London Fields on Mare St.",

It is just that tiny bit pretentious; lots of plaid shirted boys with floppy hair and girls with ballet shows and pea coats - but it's not unpleasant at all. They do coffee until closing time, which is really handy when you're flagging on the way to a big night out. The beer range is focused on the ususal popular staples, as is the wine list, but let's face it: you're not going there to drink if you're honest are you? You're going there to be seen. On any given sunny sunday (of which there have been a few I happily note) it looks a bit like London Fashion Week has descended onto a tiny corner of Hackney. I also noticed that many people just buy booze from the offy next door and stand near the throng outside the pub for some credit crunch posing.

We stopped by for a Sunday lunch - you can't book a table, but arrive before 2pm and you should be fine in Winter. There were a few good vegetarian options; I had the Wellington which came with delicious cauliflower, spuds and mashed butternut. Comes with hot cheese sauce, but a distinct lack of gravy. The meat-eaters seemed fairly content with their lot. The selection of beers is fairly average, but what makes up for this, is its a great looking pub, with good staff, good food and a great location.",

The Bloody Mary's here are AMAZING... now I'm pretty picky when it comes to Bloody Mary's (I prefer Bloody Caesar's over Mary's, being Canadian and all, so I'm a pretty tough sell when it comes to these drinks) but the ones they have a The Cat and Mutton are fantastic! Not too thick and perfectly seasoned. Yum. Sunday Roasts here are also worth checking out. Comes out really quick and are delicious and filling. If you're a group of 3+ I'd recommend getting the full chicken... the table next to us got one and we were all having a bit of food envy despite being ridiculously full from our own meals.",

The atmosphere inside is interesting due to the dark decor and metallic touches but I must admit I was not too keen on the animal heads hanging behind the bar. It does give off a hunting lodge vibe though. The food is all right but I wouldn't say it's anything special. The skewers portion was full of vegetables and hardly any meat. Their Bloody Mary smells like a frat salad and tastes quite well though.What I really liked is that they have lots of board games you can play so we had a few intense jenga rounds and a game of snakes and ladders that took way longer than it should have. It was quite fun though.I would definitely go back there if I'm near the park as its a great place to go for a drink after a barbecue.",

Luckily Cat & Mutton is well positioned, and just as it started to rain (pour!). Great spot for a weekday pub lunch! We started with the olives and hummus (both served with warm sourdough toast), Mac and cheese gratin with mushrooms (made fresh in its own skillet!), fish n' chips with mushy peas, chicken club (the only slight miss, would've been much better on that wonderful sourdough -- instead it was soggy wheat that was pressed in a panini fashion), numerous ciders, beers...all very satisfying. We left stuffed to make our way back home in the rain. Service was great, too. Friendly, helpful, quick food that is made right before you in the open kitchen. I'm sure this place can get mobbed on the weekends, but for Friday lunch we were quite comfortable, had a wonderful meal and enjoyed the staff. Would definitely return.",

I've been coming for a few months now and never struggled to find myself a seat, table or little booth to enjoy a few pints. Started coming here after work on a Friday evening but this soon turned into a few more evenings, and now I rarely leave over the weekend! It's a really unique pub, huge ceilings on both floors, and plenty of space to move about. The vibe in here is more than friendly, the bar staff are all keen to have a chat and just enjoy the few hours or drinks that you're going to spend there.In the week, you have a great Wednesday quiz night which is challenging but certainly got a sprinkle on fun in there (paper aeroplane round!) and the food is more tasty, quite reasonable too.During the summer days, the place is even more perfect. With London Field directly opposite people just pop in when they can and with the amazing saturday market right out the door you can't help but pop in. I'd more than urge you to try this pub out, it's worth going to the area to just sit back and relax. Perfect.",

Its got delicous food, it serves a wide range of drinks including a fine Guinness, its spacious and airy inside and there is rarely an evening when it is not full enough to have some sort of atmosphere going on. In practice I avoid it. Something about the vibe created by so many young, alternative and utterly, utterly self-concious people puts me off. I really feel when I go here that I am entering the private members room of a club I will never be offered a membership to.If you are in the area on a Saturday and you are not as bitter about the Broadway set as me, then you can do alot worse than a swig of a bottle and a giggle at all the odd people on the crowded pavement outside. But for me that appeal wore thin pretty fast and I now usually go to the Albion, the Pembury Tavern or Bidels if I'm drinking in the locality.",

The pub itself is lacking something. The main down stairs are is one big room with tables and chairs, which feels like a school cafeteria more than anything.There is a open kitchen to the left at the back and the bar is to the right. There is a nice symmetry and I like that you can see the chefs at work. There is never a shortage of staff, all dressed up and easily mistaken for customers as they seem to spend as much time socialising as they do working. Maybe they are working, maybe that actually are paid to stand there and look good. After all, it is all about looks in this pub.The food is good, probably the best pub food in the area. Although you may pay in excess of 12 pounds for a main course, it is worth it. The Pork Belly is amazing, a \u00a0traditional dish with a contemporary twist.I must say the table service is really good. If you're lucky, Andy, the General Manager, will take your order in his \u00a0informal, yet personal and delicate manner. As far as table service for pub food goes, he is the master. Throughout the summer, people flock to the Cat and Mutton both at night and during the day. The pub cannot hold the amount of people that come and the outside area seems to stretch (illegally) across the road. Unless you are after a pretentiously trashy, rowdy and broken glass filled experience, avoid the Cat and Mutton on a warm summer night.The pub is closed on Monday day time but open Monday night. It opens normal pub hours the rest of the week.",

We went here for dinner again recently, the gnocchi was solid and inedible and Suzi Quatro's Devil Gate Drive pumping out from the speakers made me want to stand on an antique piano stool dressed as a Chelsea Pensioner and throw up my own pelvis bone. It gets too busy too unless you go Monday-Thursday night....is this place a boozer or a restaurant??!!, I don't think it quiet knows, what I do know is that if you like eating sat next to someone who smells like a Sue Ryder shop but probably earns 75k a year for sitting in front of Quark all day then you'll love it.

Located just a few feet from the sprawling London Fields, I spent a rather pleasant afternoon sipping on organic cider and watching girls (sorry I mean) the world go by. Famed for their hangover-banishing Sunday roasts, the menu is moderately priced (mains \u00a311-\u00a316) with top nosh including the scallop starter and the melt-in-the-mouth seared tuna loin.

    "text": "Bethnal Green, Broadway Market and London Fields always used to frighten me. I had read fairy tales documenting their dangerously cool and relaxed vibe and because of this I had scarcely made the commitment to seeing some of my friends who live out in that particular mythical part of London. However, as I continue on my quest to slay the hydra of preconception I have successfully integrated myself into East London life with a plop. I think it must be the hair. Either way, my first sample of London fields life was at the Cat & Mutton and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Another place that just reeks of cool. Arty types, let's call them, with their trilbies and glasses of white wine, deck the seating area and without appearing pretentious the cool of the cool clearly utilise this establishment to laugh, drink and eat. I can see why. The bar staff were relaxed, but not so relaxed that they didn't attend to glass collection with military precision and food that was ordered was promptly delivered. I didn't have any, but it smelt and looked awesome. Outside there is a general sensation of how I would imagine it is in a Lilt advert. Super laid back and refreshing. Drinks are standard London prices. You're looking at about 4.5 nuggets for a beer and 6 nuggets for a double spirit and mixer. So not cheap, but the atmosphere in there pays for itself. From what I hear it really is the go-to pub for the trendy elite. When Broadway market is in full swing it can get a little ramo, but could go a long way to calming that busy street stress level. I liked it and I'm sure you will too.",
