Visited this caf\u00e9 a few days ago, surrounded by at least ten young ladies taking pictures of their rose lattes. One of the filthiest bathrooms I have ever seen, service was slow and not particularly nice, and most importantly, food was meh. What can I say? Instagram can be deceiving. Seriously, there are so many good caf\u00e9s and restaurants in London. This one just doesn't live up to the hype.",

We tried for 15 minutes to flag down our waiter and he avoided eye contact with us. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant closest to him and were completely ignored. Also I literally can't even count on two hands how many Instagrams I was in the background of. This restaurant is basic girl heaven. So if you're into good social media pics and bad food this might be the place for you.",

    "text": "it's quite a shame to give this place such low rating as i was really looking forward to going here since they serve organic and vegan food and coffee. I took my sister here on a rainy day out in Notting Hill and wanted to spend a nice lunch with her. we were seated in a nice place for two but then forgotten for around 10-15 minutes. we had a nice waitress taking and placing our order hence one of the stars. the other star goes out to having vegan options for both lattes (almond milk) and food (i took the winter kale salad). Though the rest of the experience wasn't all that pleasant. My latte was not hot in the first place, the almond milk (which they charge an extra 60p for) didn't seem to be fresh either because the espresso and the milk wouldn't combine properly. A shame when you pay 3,5 for a quite small coffee.And now the salad. It cost 8,5 for lots of kale and just half a fig, some pistachios and chunks of quinoa - the combination could be nice of it hadn't been drowned in lemon juice. Made the whole thing not quite enjoyable and i was missing any other kind of flavour. Even salt and pepper didn't help out here - not to mention i felt a bit hungry just two hours after eating this salad.Don't get me wrong, the caf\u00e9 is a nice place in general, just the quality of the food didn't meet my expectation - if served for that price! my sister had a regular latte and a veggie sandwich, which was quite nice (i had a bite or two) - but after adding 12,5% extra on the bill, we ended up paying 27 pounds for the whole lunch, which is way too pricey, even for London, for such little food and enjoyment.Most likely won't come back - maybe for breakfast but lunch really isn't worth the fuss at this place.",

It is in a nice area, place is a little away from the crowd, in a cosy, very nicely decorated location. Staff is mix nationality (but mostly french, hence the 5 stars?!?), menu is mainly healthy looking with plenty of gluten free, organic options, and is perfect for brunch. WHile the wait cant pull you off, it is worth waiting to get in. We have tried the sandwiches, the soup (lentil/red pepper), avocado toast, juices, liquid gold teas, lavander latte, and all were very good. Very friendly staff, smiley and all, you feel right at home. It does get very busy, so hang on a little for full attention, but overall quality-service combo pleases us all the time. Note : take the half sandwich, it is more than enough. and Try the cakes because they look good though we haven't tried any yet. We ll be back very soon.",

I only dealt with two servers, but I thought the service was awesome! I ordered the crab cakes on the recommendation of the server and she was spot on... delicious! I got a side order of mushrooms on the recommendation of a different server and they were a very tiny portion and pretty mediocre. I would have given the place 5 stars but I am taking off 1 because they \u00a0are really pricey and not quite worth it. I'm taking off another star because I came back later in the afternoon to try the green smoothie and it was extremely expensive ($10), which would have been fine except that it was the most bland flavored smoothie I had ever had. Literally, it had no taste...or a very slight bad taste. I went and looked at the menu again to see what was in it and in hindsight, it's not that surprising... coconut milk, cucumber, olive oil, avocado... these foods have very little taste I guess, but there was supposedly kale that I couldn't taste. Still, it killed me, but I threw that $10 smoothie in the trash the moment I stepped outside.",

Love the charming feel of the place and the lattes are both delicious and just asking to be Instagrammed. I tried the charcoal latte, which is black (very cool!) and sweetened with date syrup. It was surprisingly delicious, as was my husband's chai latte which came with the cutest dog latte art. I went in the late afternoon on a weekend and there weren't any pastries left plus the kitchen was closed as they don't stay open till evening, so I would say get there early if you want to eat or have brunch. The atmosphere was quite relaxed, with everyone chatting away at their cosy tables with no urgency. I think I would rather bring my girlfriends here than my husband, as the menu seems to be quite light other than the pastries. The staff here was really sweet and as this is Notting Hill, the crowd seemed posh. I am definitely coming back to try the rose latte and the avocado toast!",

The ones that'd presumably been sat out, uncovered, all day and hadn't yet sold. There wasn't a cake in sight! Disappointing, to say the least. The latte itself however was utterly delicious. It held such an unusual floral flavour, the milk having been infused with rose water and the latte topped with crushed rose petals. I seriously enjoyed it. It was just perfect and made such a refreshing change from sweet & sickly caramel coffees. \u00a0Whilst we were there we decided to peruse the menu in case we wanted to return but were entirely put off by the prices, \u00a36-7.50 for a smoothie!

I ordered the Latte Black, Rose Latte and Coconut BLT. The Latte Black (w activated charcoal) was cool and different, sort of tasted like warm milk though. I really enjoyed the Rose Latte and appreciated its uniqueness and the infused rose water was quite amazing. The Coconut BLT was also good, it didn't really stick out to me, but wasn't bad. I went midday on a Monday and there was only a 15 minute wait. However, I heard the weekend wait is a lot longer so I'd recommend visiting on a weekday. Furthermore the staff was super friendly and the environment was quirky and cute. I'd definitely recommend!",

It was so cute through and the food was worth it! We got avocado toast to share for the table, and they give you cucumber water too which was refreshing. We got a rose and matcha latte, which are just so darn cute. For my meal, I ordered the berry pancakes which really lived up to my expectations. They were fluffy but still healthier than an average pancake because they're made out of buckwheat, and the berries, coconut, and syrup on top made it so tasty! My friends ordered the pitaya bowl and the farm salad, which were excellent as well. For take away, I got one of the vegan donuts for the next morning and it was soooo yummy! Definitely take a look at the baked goods at the counter.",

The cafe inside is very aesthetic with sketches on the walls and this blue tiling. The menu is entirely vegetarian, and there is a lot of nice options for vegan dishes, gluten free, and dairy free. I tried the pink salad which had watermelon, cucumber, kale with a little bit of nori sprinkled on top. It came this honey mustard and berry vinaigrette. The watermelon was very refreshing, but I found that the salad was a little bland; I wish it came with more dressing. For cafe, I ordered the rose latte. It was so-so, but very instagramable. The VIP of the brunch was definitely the coconut BLT sandwich. They had vegan bacon made from smoked coconut! The sandwich came with tomatoes, lettuce, and a generous amount of fresh guacamole. It came with toasty bread, and it was one of my favorites! Overall, the aesthetic of this cafe is everything: very cute and features a nice selection of farm to plate menu options.",

    "text": "I went here for the first time about a month ago.LOCATION: This location is in Notting Hill on Portobello Road. It's a nice and cute area, and I like how the cafe is kind of tucked away (it's not hard to find or anything though, but if you've been there/once you see it, you'd get what I mean by \"tucked away\" lol. 4/5ATMOSPHERE: There's a little outdoor patio area, as well as inside seating. It's pretty quaint and homey. 4/5SELECTION: They're whole menu is basically brunch-type items, like breakfast foods, sandwiches and salads, and lots of different drinks, like lots of unique lattes, coffees, and juices. I like that they label which items are vegan, gluten-free, and nut-free. They could have a few more vegan items, but then again, I shouldn't complain because at least they have a few and they're clearly-labeled. 3/5WHAT I GOT: I got their Latte Black and Acai Bowl with granola (\u00a33 extra). First off, the latte was amazing. Hands down, it was the best latte of my life. It's a charcoal latte, so the ingredients are activated charcoal, date syrup, and cashew milk. Thinking back, the taste of it was simple and basic, but it was unique and it wasn't bitter or anything, nor overly sweet. I'm sorry, I really don't know how to describe it, but if you're into health-conscious wellness-type lattes at all, I'd definitely recommend it. On to their Acai Bowl: it was pretty good. It wasn't one of the best I've ever had, but it was still tasty. The acai blend was thick, but it could've been a little less icy-ish (not that there were icy chunks, but I've just found that when acai bowls are made with almond milk -- like this one -- they have this weird icy-ish texture, so maybe a thicker milk like cashew milk would be better...just my take). Anyways on to the toppings: the fruit was good, including the coconut, as well as the chia seeds. And the granola was pretty good as well -- it wasn't too chewy or hard. I just don't get why they charge extra for it, when most acai bowls automatically come with granola. 4/5SERVICE: The service was good. All the employees were nice and attentive, and we didn't have to wait an abnormal amount of time for our food to come out. 4/5",

    "text": "Beautiful place, atmosphere and food, and while it doesn't lack in presentation, it lacked in flavor a bit. I saw this place all over the internet and as a lover of cafe culture I knew I had to go here after a visit to Notting Hill. My sister ordered the fruit & yogurt which she enjoyed, and I ordered the avocado toast with a poached egg. It was presented beautifully but the avocado was seasoned poorly and the egg was also very bland. It tasted fresh but was lacking seasoning for sure, I've had much better. We also had two croissants, pistachio and raspberry - they were very good, raspberry was definitely the better of the two. For drinks, I ordered the chai latte which was wonderful, and my sister had a pretty average cappuccino. Service was prompt, kind, and accommodating - bathrooms needed some attention - but overall it's an inviting and warm, atmospheric place to have breakfast/brunch/lunch. The ladies sitting next to my sister & I ordered more savory items on their varied menu and the smell was wonderful - so perhaps just ask for some salt/pepper if you choose to order the avo toast.",

    "text": "The first time I'd heard of this place was when a group of friends and I decided on a whim to stop by for lunch on a Saturday at half past noon; unsurprisingly the queue was massive, with a 2-hour wait, so we gave it a miss. However, that did make me want to try again later, so the next time I needed to make breakfast plans with a friend, I suggested we come here shortly before 10 AM, again on a Saturday.When we arrived, all of the outdoor seating and a large chunk of the indoor seating was already occupied. However, we did get a table without having to wait. It was a bit of a tight squeeze, as all the tables are really close together. It does make it easy to spy on what the other customers ordered, which can help you make a decision since a lot of the items on the menu look enticing. The restaurant is cute and charming and has a cozy atmosphere.We went for the acai bowl and the baked eggs as our mains, along with the rose latte and the hibiscus matcha latte. We also spied an interesting-looking green-striped croissant that the waiter informed us was pistachio flavored; we ordered this too and it was served on a warm plate. There was complimentary cucumber water at each table.I loved everything we ordered. The acai bowl was very refreshing and the eggs were flavorful and reminiscent of Mediterranean cuisine. I did wish the eggs had come with more than 1 slice of bread; even if my friend and I hadn't been sharing everything we ordered, I still would have wanted more bread for just myself. The rose latte was beautifully decorated and really did taste of rose. The hibiscus latte was really tasty too. The pistachio croissant had a green pistachio gel inside and I think it was also on the outside as a decorative stripe; I would have liked to have had actual pistachio somewhere in or on the croissant, but I imagine that changes the baking.I didn't think we were rushed at all during our meal, but we did come before the brunch rush. By the time we left, at around 11-11:30, there was a pretty long queue, but not as long as the one I'd seen the first time I came here. The service wasn't terribly fast, but I didn't think it was particularly slow either, and certainly not slower than what I've experienced elsewhere in London. The staff we encountered were friendly and willing to answer questions.Our total meal came out to be about \u00a335, which isn't bad for London and seemed reasonable given the amount of food we ordered. I was able to pay with my American bank card without any issues (signature required). The restaurant is very well located; definitely stop by the Notting Hill Portobello Road Market if you're there on a Saturday!",

We waited about 30 minutes to get a spot, but once we finally got a spot the food and service was quick and great. Ordered a latte and the avocado toast and would recommend. Was surprised with how much food was served. Very yummy! The atmosphere here is great and would recommend this place to someone who is tired of pub food. But be cautious and come when you have some time to spare because you probably will be waiting.",

My boyfriend and I decided to try Farm Girl during our last trip after recommended to us by a local blogger.I admire their menu for being health conscious with many gluten and dairy free options, but we were not impressed with the food. I ordered an English Breakfast tea and a scramble on toast. My scramble didn't have much flavor at all and only had a few ingredients in it - basically just plain eggs on toast.Other than the cute interior, I felt rushed to eat my food and leave so they could flip my table. Wish I liked the food better because it's such a cute place, but had way better meals throughout our trip.",

First, we were met by a member of staff who didn't greet us, he just looked at me and my friend as we walked in and as time went on he kept up this unfriendly manner. Secondly, everything is SUPER expensive and the servings are tiny, total waste of money! My friend and I ordered an a\u00e7ai bowl each that although tasted nice, was nothing extraordinary, and was served in the most tiny bowl. I also ordered a hibiscus latte which was nice however again super expensive and nothing extraordinary. The whole dining experience just felt stiff and unwelcoming, not to mention the absurdly high compulsory service fee they lump on at the end, on top of the exorbitant cost of the food. Although the decor is pretty, don't get sucked in. I'm sure there are many other cute cafes which offer friendlier service and better value for you to spend your money on. Don't go here!",
