I've eaten tasty brunch and lunch here and never felt disappointed. \u00a0The only minor issue is, I think the price of some of the options skirts the quantity/quality barrier. Either more food at the same price or the same food at a lower price would push this place into perfect.The staff are usually great - I have on occasion been served by ones that were mediocre, but usually only the once and then they're never seen again. \u00a0The regular staff are all friendly, helpful and quick to respond. Even when you show up with bloodshot eyes and speak in a barely audible croak!",

    "text": "Recently, after I was ignored at a near-by roastery for half an hour, I gave up and walked around the corner to the antipodean place Salvation Jane. Salvation Jane is a good cafe that offers a very similar menu and style as the Fitzrovia coffee shop Lantana. The advantage of Salvation Jane is, that it is more of a restaurant than a little coffee shop. Some people might also count this as disadvantage. Anyway, I was two or three times at Salvation Jane so far and very much like it. In particular, I like the toast or in general the breakfast and brunch you could get there. So many places in London serve crappy bread as toast, Salvation Jane is a very welcome exception. And you could also get a decent coffee there. All in all, Salvation Jane is probably not the cheapest spot for scrambled eggs on toast and a cup of coffee, but at least you get proper bread, nice and friendly staff and a relaxed atmosphere. I will definitely go there again.",

    "text": "There's been a growth of new restaurants appearing in Old Street and some quite attracting too. Salvation Jane were one of the first ones to open that got me excited to try out being a sister of Lantana, a popular brunch place and Salvation of Jane was no different. I really thought I was in for a let down when I saw they had removed the Spanish Style Baked Eggs off the menu as it was the dish I wanted. My heart sank when I couldn't find it. But I'm pretty glad in the end as it got me trying new brunch dishes I wouldn't usually have ordered if I saw baked eggs. So in the end I settled for my corn fritters stacked w/ streaky bacon, fresh spinach and slow roast tomatoes served w/ avocado chilli lime salsa and cr\u00e8me fraiche whilst my boyfriend went for the toasted sourdough, organic streaky bacon, a fried egg, rocket, fresh tomato and aioli. We also added a side of a halloumi. Both dishes were delicious although I only got to have a bite out of the boyfriend's one so will not review his. There was so much going on that it was hard to believe how wholesome it actually was. The combination of ingredients used was faultless. The beautifully grilled corn fritters had a lovely seasoning, slightly spiced and each bite had soft little burst of sweetness coming through with the corn. Lovely fresh crunches from the spinach and the perfectly salted lightly crisp bacon giving me that 'Saturday treat yourself' feel. The perfect sunny side up, avocado and creme friache wrapped things up nicely, adding that buttery creamy texture to each mouthful. The halloumi came nice and chunky and no complaints there. The whole dish was just made with simple ingredients but put together it tasted amazing. I finished with my Chai Latte which was probably one of the best I've had as you could actually taste the tea. It was creamy with distinctive notes of ginger which was really warming. Together with the fresh looking wooden decor, natural lighting shining through, homely furniture with a mini bookshelf containing fun little books for a quick read and a self serving condiment shelf, my brunch experience became the perfect start to my weekend. It's the place I would choose to go for relaxation, a feel of home but being served by lovely waiting staff, all very welcoming too. Really highly recommend this place.",

The cafe is pretty minimalist; big wooden tables, murals of Australian flora and fauna with the occasional bird thrown in there for good measure.The menu is really good - there's a lot of variation on it, but it's not one of those menus that has so much on it that you feel like you're reading a dissertation instead of a list of food options.The food was DELICIOUS. It's pretty unusual, but divine nonetheless. I had wheat-free toast with smashed avocado, bacon and poached eggs, while another friend opted for some corn fritters with bacon, and another had some concoction of ham hock and chorizo. Everyone agreed that the food was brilliant, and at under \u00a310 for generous portions, I'll definitely be visiting again.The only downside was that the service was pretty slow - we had to wait about 15 minutes to finally get the bill. Usually by that point I have naturally assumed that the business doesn't want my money, but my companions assured me that this was likely not the case.",

Your staff are kind and handsome. Your coffee is well-crafted, potent, and flavorful. And your food. Your food is the thing to not be missed. You have a thoughtful menu: well seasoned and moderately priced, featuring preparations that allow the quality of the ingredients to shine through. And oh! Your baked goods are also exceptional. \u00a0Dare I ask... are you seeing anyone? Can I come a-calling again soon? I don't want to be too forward, but as you can probably sense, I am quite taken with you. Yours truly,KB",

Kiwi baristas shout hello when you walk in and it's all very relaxed and Sunday-fabulous. The BERT (bacon sandwich) is the business, with crispy gorgeous bacon and a poached egg to run down the side. Nom! I always go for the sourdough toast with lashings of butter and vanilla blueberry jam. If I was ever feeling virtuous, the bircher muesli is divine and a decent meal on its own. If you want to pop in for cakes, they have a tasty selection of mini cakes, brownies and Antipodean type treats.",

(is Brunching really becoming a Thing in London? I can imagine a Sunday punctuated by Brunch and Roast...) Everything's good, but it's almost as if they've ticked all the boxes - 'locally sourced meat', 'funky peppery lettuces', 'poshed up bacon sarnie', 'good antipodean coffee'... all at prices to match. It's fine. It just doesn't crack the four-star barrier for me.Plus, they do that thing that annoys me - adding in 15% service on top. Chaps: this is London. 10% is correct, 12.5% is cheeky and annoying, but 15% is just over the bloody top. I, like lots of people, will add on a better tip, in cash, without card fees or delays. It's not like someone's going to stiff you.",

    "text": "At Lantana, you will find an awesome Aussie style brunch and I say this as an Aussie. Their brunch items are veggie-forward, filling and well-thought out. The weekday breakfast menu featured some pretty creative and unique savory brunch items. My friend and I shared the corn fritters and pulled pork drowned eggs. My favorite of the two was the corn fritters. It came with streaky bacon, fresh spinach, roasted tomatoes, smashed avocado and lemon creme fraiche. The entire dish was very well executed - all the ingredients went well together and it was bursting with flavors. The pulled pork drowned eggs were pretty awesome too. We asked to substitute the fried eggs for scrambled eggs, but it came with sourdough, spicy tomato sauce and parmesan. This was quite interesting as I've never had anything like it before. The pulled pork was tender and flavorful. The eggs were fluffy and the spicy tomato sauce added so much depth to the dish. Overall, Lantana serves some pretty delicious and filling brunch here. Prices are decent too. I highly recommend checking this place out!",

Also the kale bread. So many great savoury flavours and excellent portion sizes for the admittingly a bit expensive prices. Also my husband loved the coffee. The desserts were also top-notch: the salted caramel bar and the banana walnut cake earned praise for their rich textures and tastes. The only niggling factor? All the dishes were quite salty so I definitely felt as if I would have a heart attack by the end. Also the service wasn't great; out waitress was very nice but the amount of people she had to serve meant she went missing when we needed more table water, extra plates etc. Overall though I would definitely return for how creative the dishes were. Just make sure you make a reservation!",

Had a most enjoyable evening at this very casual, easy ambience, welcoming place, where you are served by the owner himself.My friend and I wanted somewhere for a drink and a catch up chat for an hour or so, so stumbled here, just off the Old Street roundabout, as somewhere close to where we worked in the City, so alas City prices, \u00a327 for two glasses of wine and a small mezze board including service charge, but you do get decent quality food and drinks, especially the wine, the owner, George, actually let us have a tasting of the wines before ordering which was a really nice touch. \u00a0They have a really nice summer nights menu serving Mediterranean cuisine. \u00a0We chose the Mezze board to go with our ros\u00e9 which included grilled chirozo, green olives, hummus, dukkha, cornichons and toasted sourdough. Not a large board, almost a taster size, but we were not looking to dine, so suited us for something to snack at while drinking our wine. Great atmosphere at the front of the cafe, nice rustic feel with wooden tables, and a full wine rack up one wall, makes a nice decor. To my surprise when I went to check-in, it said it was closed at 6pm. \u00a0But apparently, they have started to stay open until 10pm a few months ago, so that needs updating, as if I was checking my Yelp app, I would have missed such a great place as it said it was closed!",

    "text": "Lantana has the rudest server I've ever had the displeasure of meeting, and her colleagues let it affect their performance as well. The food and drinks we did receive were good (thus the two stars) but the service was so horrible, it completely affected my review. Lantana owners/ manager: why don't you change your website opening times rather than allow your servers to ignore people waiting at the host desk for over 10 minutes (7:25-7:38). Or train your staff properly. I understand you don't open until 7:30, but your front door was open. If you have any staff in, they should politely greet me, the customer who was quietly and patiently waiting for a greeting on Thursday, May 24th. In that greeting, a staff member should have said that someone will be over to seat me in a few minutes, they would open at 7:30. Then, at 7:30, come to the desk, explain that the kitchen will be open at 8 am but that I am welcome to take a seat until then, seat me, and give me a menu. What actually happened was far from target service standards, and show how one hungover, self-involved \"team\" member can ruin a customer's perception of a restaurant and affect the whole serving staff's morale.The servers/baristas behaved deplorably. I have worked in restaurants and I understand that if your website says \"kitchen opens at 8 am,\" that I cannot order until the kitchen is set up and open. \u00a0However, I had to seat myself, my friend is far more assertive than I, so she approached the bar and asked to take a seat. My friend was traveling and had heavy luggage. From behind the bar, after taking the time to attend to some set up task far more important than customers, the blonde, shoulder or chin length Australian woman with her hair sloppily, half pulled back, rolled her eyes and finally haughtily explained we could sit down but they didn't open until 8 am. We said that's fine, we know your kitchen opens at 8 am, we read the website. Then she rolled her eyes and went back to her set up. Every single interaction with this woman was similar or worse. \u00a0One colleague, a brunette man, did greet us after we were seated. We had to ask for menus. We told him we, \"were happy to wait to order until he could take our order. We understood that the order could not be placed for a few more minutes.\" He couldn't find his note pad in his apron and made some excuse. It was 7:57 am or so. We were eventually allowed to order two coffees, two rather expensive brunch meals, and a smoothie, which was never served. Our food came and my egg was poached properly. \u00a0The food was delicious, portions were large, I couldn't finish mine. We had to ask for our bill, and the servers didn't bother printing an itemised receipt for us, when I asked for an itemised receipt, she pointed to the credit card reader readout and said it's there: yes, it was, but we didn't get our smoothie you tried to charge us for. I pointed it out and said I'd like the smoothie we didn't get removed, as well as the service charge. She left without a word, and went to print the corrected receipt, without an apology. My friend and I paid and she left, and I had to ask for a box, but the attitude I got was completely rude. Really and truly, check your attitude and rudeness at the door and get your service face in order. Looks like she'll need a full mask to pull that off.",

Take your pick, Jane saved me from all of these things. While it may look quite small from its address on City Road, it's rolls into a back area with very ample, quite comfortable, seating. Rows of communal tables and quiet corners to conversate and dine --- you'll find right here. The space is new and shiny (housed in a newer building) with very clean restrooms, a smiling staff, and nice offerings. However, a bit pricey. A breakfast for 3 (each with a main and a beverage) ran close to 50 quid. Not that the quality didn't match the price tag, but just watch out as you peruse. The Smoked Haddock Hashcakes + fresh spinach and poached eggs were quite lovely, very obviously prepared this morning, and hit the spot. Not too big. Not too small, the right temperature and consistency for hashcakes, and the eggs...perfect. My dining companion's Cinnamon French Toast with cream and berries though? WOW. Looked absolutely amazing and she concurred. As I mentioned, the service is good. Very good for London. Only misstep? Those half-eaten hashcakes hung out in front of me FAR past when I had decided that we should separate. Enjoying Americano #2 without the lingering smell of fish would've been highly preferable. However, only misstep on the service side. It also seems very...BRIGHT in here. Some better light might set the ambience up a bit better. There also seemed to be quite a few interviews being conducted, just a funny observation more than anything else. :) Go get those jobs, people! Jane will save you! Would be a great place to curl up for a nice meal, bring a group or just pop in for some takeaway (in the front, premade sandwiches, coffeebar, etc). Will add to the breakfast rotation around Old Street Tube stop. Next...Ozone!",

They also offer a great lunch deal: Tart + 2 salads. Quite good as well. I will be back, for sure. Breakfast time I think!",

    "text": "Hmmm. Only some impressive, last-minute customer service from the manager here saved Lantana from a \"I will strike you down with great vengeance and furious anger\" review. Lantana looks the part of relaxed Aussie brunch place all right. A warm, yet modern space divided into different themes. Predominantly young arty professional customers. Coffee listed on a blackboard. The (Allpress) coffee was good. We were about to hit up the London Coffee Festival so opted for a decaf. It was solid. The food however was disappointing. I had a rather messy mix of fried egg, meat and potato. It was okay, but not particularly flavoursome. My girlfriend's corn fritters however were outright tasteless. Seriously. Seriously weird. It was like they'd ruthlessly hunted down the cheapest ingredients, thrown them together and hoped no-one would complain amid the trendy surroundings. The manager saved the situation somewhat though by asking how our food was and immediately removing the fritters from the bill when we shared our feelings on it. So A-OK it is, even though once bitten twice shy: I doubt I'd be racing back here if in the area and in the market for brunch.",

    "text": "I have a very special bonding with Salvation Jane, why? Well I had my job interview here and guess what I actually got the job! I think one of the stars is probably because of that! But the rest 4 they deserve every bit of it! I am very bored of all the Starbucks and Costa's so every time somebody introduces me to a new cafe I get extremely excited. Salvation Jane is also such a pretty name, being a marketing person names of restaurants gets me very excited to a point that sometimes I might like a place purely because of its name (ok that is probably an exaggeration). For all you nasty smokes (I am included) they have a smoking shed outside which is such a saving grace during winters because you don't have to freeze to death to have a smoke. The tea pots they have are very pretty and blue, I have a lovely photograph of that too because the day I visited I happened to wear nail paint of the exact same shade of blue! The breakfast menu looks absolutely stunning and the options are just so confusing (in a good way) because there is so much to chose from. I had a Cinnamon Toast with cream and berries -- wooohhh delicious will be an understatement. I will have to mention that it is not exactly a cheap breakfast or budget meal place so I think you should save this place for special occasions if you are not loaded like me. The waitress we had was very friendly and she helped me pick my dish too.Verdict : If you are near Shoreditch and looking for a good breakfast place, you know where to go! :)",

This time, I opted for the smashed avacados, served with a good slab of gluten-free bread, poached eggs, cream cheese and bacon. All the flavours mixed perfectly together, lightly finished off with some hazelnut dukkah, and a decent size portion. The price is a little more dear than other brunch options, but the amazing food makes up for it. Definately worth checking out!",

The portion wasn't huge but the taste was definitely amazing - surprising because I've never really been a fan of lentil to start with. There's also a variety of drink selections and desserts.
