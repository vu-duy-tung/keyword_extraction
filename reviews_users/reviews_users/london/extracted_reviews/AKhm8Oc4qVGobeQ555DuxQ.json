We had a larger group (10) coming in for lunch but were told in a curt tone to wait, it would just be 10-20 minutes. We had three kids with us in the group. After 20 minutes they still refused to seat us despite many tables being visibly open and ready for service. They finally jammed us into the front end but left us one chair short. When asked for a chair the greeter simply said we don't have any, you will just have to make due. We tried to seat ourselves but then waited another five minutes before anyone even came over with menus. We then left. There are so many better choices on Picadilly, as we luckily discovered, just a few doors down. There is just no reason to come here with a group.",

It's not cheap because they probably pay a ridiculous rent for the location but there are lots of tasty options for under \u00a310. \u00a0For example, the grilled goat's cheese with caramelised onions and tomatoes on toast is divine and costs less than \u00a36. \u00a0The onions are sweet and well-cooked (if a tad too acidic for my taste), the tomatoes are nicely grilled and the goat cheese is deliciously rich. \u00a0 It was topped with a drizzle of a creamy cilantro sauce, which made all the difference. \u00a0 The substantial soup bowl and a side of baguette will fill you up, unless you're a football player or think you need to eat like one.I did see tourists at a table nearby having afternoon tea and I wondered why on earth anyone would seek out a typical English tradition in a French bistro. \u00a0 I also several solo diners of advanced age who looked like they'd been coming there for years, which gave me confidence in the food and added to the feeling of being whisked back to old Paree. \u00a0If I was in the neighborhood again, I'd definitely return.",

Amazingly, nothing had really changed, the elaborately pretty, red-and-green, chinoiserie-style d\u00e9cor remained. Not sure I recollect the menu from my early visits as a youngster but it seemed fairly true to its origins. There were some creative 'modernised' starters that almost tempted us into eating, although on a cold and drizzly November night, all we really wanted was a warming drink and a cosy place to chat. After much perusing, umming-and-aahing, we (boringly?) just opted for a pot of tea each (at \u00a32.70). I was quite surprised when it arrived in a very stained 'stainless-steel' pot, which had seen far better days (mine didn't even close properly) - rather than elegant china, which would have been far more in keeping with the setting and ethos. The floor beneath our table had remnants from a previous customer's breakfast jam jar lids. Recommended as a useful stopping-off point for a (relatively) traditional cup of tea, or a snack, when you're seeking an antidote, or contrast, to the plethora of modern chains. A little disappointing in certain areas and attention to detail.",

It started when we stayed around the corner at the Cavendish in 1983, and - when pressed for lunch suggestions - our tour guide asked, \"Have you been to Richoux?\"And so our fun little \"tradition\" began, \u00a0and each time it's as delish as we remember.This past month we were lucky to be staying in London nearby for our 3rd visit to Richoux, and it did not disappoint. Courteous waitstaff, great location...the menu is loaded with other promising options but we only think of the delectable fish and chips!",

    "text": "Unlike its moniker, Richoux is not a French cafe, but a pretty typical English cafe. Part of a small chain, this one is on Piccadilly Rd, and provides a pleasant oasis to escape the shopping precinct. Food is standard English fare. I had the Welsh Rarebit (a bit ordinary) and a surprisingly good espresso. The house specialty is definitely the assortment of patisserie and desserts, including Rich Fruit cake, Baked Apple pie, waffles and a great variety of fruit tarts, creamy cakes, Etc.For a traditional English afternoon tea indulge in their\"Traditional Afternoon Tea\" consisting of finger sandwiches with smoked salmon, egg mayonnaise, cucumber and chicken followed by warm baby scones with strawberry preserve and Cornish clotted cream, also a rich fruit cake followed by one of the patisserie. Follow this up with a choice of tea, coffee or hot chocolate.Overall, a lovely British experience, with just the correct ambience, let down by indifferent service and very average food.",

    "text": "Sorry guys but it has been pretty disappointing.I have been quite few times there (i guess four, not sure though). Everytime was nice. There were a couple of Italian waiters and bartenders and an Italian Manager. They were very nice, not only with me, but with every customer in the place. Also there was a lovely spanish girl, very helpful when you needed to choose which dessert/tea you wanted. If it was for them I would have written a 4stars review, but...My last time has been AWFUL. I wanted to have a lovely cake I saw at the entrance with fruit on it. So i looked at the menu and there was: \"fruit cake. Fresh cake made with fruit, served with fruit\". Well it's a damn fruit cake, i thought.... NO! I received this brown piece of wood and I asked what was that. The waitress (in a very rude way) said it was the fruit cake. I then asked where the fruit was and she replied \"inside\" and run away. I then asked to another waiter where the fruit was and he said again inside. I then asked which kind of fruit was inside and they said \"nuts\". WTF? There was written fruit on the menu not nuts.I then asked to have a fruit cake and that i didn't want to eat that cake. The waiter called the manager who was rude and upset when I said I wanted fresh fruit. He stared to argue with my, saying I didn't understand English as on the menu there is written fruit, and nuts are fruit and so on. After a while I was so disappointed I asked for a Fruit salad. He took me to the counter and showed three fruit salad and in a sarcastic way he started to say that I had to choose which fruit salad I wanted as he had no intentions to bring another dish back as he was so busy. I was speachless. I agree that maybe I was a little picky as I wanted fresh fruit, but I was a customer who has to pay for what is asking. Why was the manager so rude with me?I mean he could have just asked me what was wrong, explained me in a good and polite way about the \"language difficulties\" (are we serious about this?) and change me the nuts-cake for a fruit salad and that could have been it.I was so disappointed by this last experience. Sorry guys, bad experience",

    "text": "Our friends who have been visiting London for over 30 years just raved about this restaurant. French food is not my favorite, but I decided to go along with our group of 4. First we were seated at a tiny table where we hardly had room to breathe because our chairs were so close to the other tables. Next, it was about 10 minutes until our order was taken. It took 20 minutes just for us to get some water. Our waiter was acting like it was all a joke. The other young waiter was acting like he was pissed about everything. Another table asked him for water. I watched him roll his eyes and slam the pitcher and glasses on the bar where he was getting water. After that another 20-30 minutes to get our food, which was actually just mediocre. I had to add salt and pepper to the risotto, something I never need to do in other restaurants. Lastly, my husband asked for the bill. We waited again. Finally, he walked over near the stairs to ask for the bill again. Our young waiter was walking up the stairs reading something on his smartphone. Sorry, if you want return business have someone there managing these young men who were totally incompetent. We won't be returning.",

    "text": "I couldn't go to London without sampling an authentic high tea, could I? My friends suggested Richoux, which is supposedly French, but I just followed the locals and suspended by disbelief. The exterior is bright red and classy, and the inside feels very art deco old money pretty. The ceiling is stained glass and the carpets are lush. That said, the restaurant was on the dim side and certain elements of the service made the experience a little less posh, but still good. That said, please don't come in with flip flops, shorts, or tank tops... You would feel awkward. My table ordered the traditional afternoon tea, which comes with finger sandwiches (smoked salmon, egg mayonnaise, cucumber chicken), warm baby scones, strawberry preserve and Cornish clotted cream, rich fruit cake and a pastry with tea, coffee or a mug of hot chocolate. Each person got their own pot of tea and we opted for extra scones. I loved the baby scones - they were the perfect size for tea and to avoid carbing it up too much. They were buttery and fluffy, but I could have skipped on the raisins mixed in. The sandwiches were good, but a little dry. I was expecting open faced sandwiches, but they were full sandwiches with bread on both sides. I loathed the fruit cake, but I've never been a fan anyway. Others at the table who are not so averse to fruitcake said it was tasty. And the raspberry pastry (that looked like a giant macaron) was fantastic. I also really enjoyed my Richoux \"own blend\" of breakfast tea, which was smooth and well rounded without being steeped too long. The Richoux Earl Grey was also tasty with good notes of bergamot. However, I found the jasmine tea to be too bland, with not enough fragrance to make it distinctive. (Yes, I know its supposed to be a light tea. This was basically drinking hot water.)The service was mediocre. While we had a reservation and the restaurant was only 20% occupied, we still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. When we were seated, one of the chairs was covered in powdered sugar. Since my group was a little young and a bit casual, I felt that service was a bit disdainful of us, even though were were not being loud or disruptive. (Perhaps we didn't order enough for them?) Our tea and food came after a 20 minute wait and they let us leisurely enjoy our tea, but it did take a while to get the check. The price is good, especially if you're splitting the tea among a party of 4. But if you're a small party, it will feel very expensive until \"tea\" really means \"lunch\" to you.",
