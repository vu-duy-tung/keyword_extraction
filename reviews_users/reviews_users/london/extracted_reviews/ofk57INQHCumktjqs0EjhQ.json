Food is great too with speedy service and Italian pizzazz. Particularly enjoyed the seafood fritti, fresh calamari and garlic aioli. Also enjoyed the rib eye with garlic and chilli, not so much the veal, too thin and the coating wasn't right. Loved my panna cotta dessert, best I've tried in London! Double espresso came with flaky pastry-I wasn't hungry anymore but ate them all anyway!?! Lovely touch. Finally, lots of the staff said thank you and goodbye, a thoroughly enjoyable evening. NB. Reserve a table and try to sit at the back to see into the kitchen!",

It reminded me of a chic NYC restaurant mixed with an Italian bistro. The service was attentive and helpful. The food is served tapas style and is meant to be shared, so be prepared to order a few dishes to experience the broad range of delicacies. Everything we ordered was amazingly fresh and flavorful. I ordered a truffle ravioli and it was sooooo good! I didn't want to share with anyone! The best part of the restaurant was the fact that my very picky in-laws LOVED the food and will be frequenting the restaurant in the future. Yum, yum Cicchetti! I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "So, when my mum recommended to me an Italian small-plates restaurant right next to Piccadilly Circus, you can understand why I felt rather sceptical and envisioned a rather overpriced tourist trap with excessively salty food. \u00a0However, my mum is quite particular about food and I must say that, from the outside, the window display is rather enticing with hanging charcuterie, arrays of pasta, and an assorted variety of fish. \u00a0You can also catch a glimpse of the salad counter which, whilst not as enticing as the awesome Franze and Evans' near Brick Lane, is pretty. \u00a0The inside itself is rather swish with the marble tabletops and bar counter (although I'm undecided about the lemon-yellow chairs); overall, whilst smart, it still feels relaxed.The menu is split into what I guess is a standard all-year card, featuring several sections (bready items, soups, carpaccios, salads, meats, fishes, pastas), a smaller card with an array of seasonal dishes, and the daily specials board.As some may know, I deeply dislike 'small plates'-style dining, especially when it's referred to as tapas (not that Cicchetti does). \u00a0Maybe I'm just being overly whiny/grouchy, but I don't like getting a plate the 1/3 the size of a main dish for 2/3 of the price. \u00a0It's smart business, but it almost always leaves me feeling rather shafted. \u00a0Cicchetti does recommend \"two people, 5-6 dishes for a full dining experience blah blah blah\" and I was trying very very hard not to grumble (saved by the fact that the menu is pretty impressive), but eventually plopped for 6 dishes - fried calamari, tuna tartare, rare rib-eye steak, halibut with samphire and cherry toms, lobster risotto, and pennette amatriciana (pig cheek, red onion, and tomato sauce with small penne). \u00a0My mum also went for the two-oysters-with-glass-of-prosecco (the oysters were large and fresh - considering I'm not really a fan with them, I quite enjoyed them).I have to say, I was really impressed by the size of the dishes, especially the rib-eye and halibut dishes, both of which carried substantial chunks of meat. \u00a0The presentation was also great, and I really appreciated the painstaking effort that the waiter put into mixing my tuna tartare. \u00a0The quality of the food is really good generally - the halibut was particularly well put together with crunchy samphire next to soft fish and the tomatoes sweet-but tangy; the tartare was seasoned very nicely, not dominated by onions or capers; the steak was excellent - very juicy and chargrilled; the lobster risotto carrying plenty of shellfishy flavour (seems that they make the stock the right way).(another reason to dislike small plates - too many bloody dishes to write about)Hey, and my double espresso was very good too - whilst it should be a given in such a restaurant, it isn't always. \u00a0It's one of the few times I've been to a small plates restaurant and actually felt full. \u00a0Unfortunately, it did mean that I didn't have any room for dessert, but they look REALLY TASTY.The staff are very friendly; at the beginning of the meal I did feel a little hounded and rushed (two different waiters asked us for drinks, and when I asked for an extra few minutes to look over the menu, I got about 90 seconds). \u00a0Also, the plates all came out at once which was a bit of a logistical nightmare as the tables aren't particularly big. \u00a0However, after the food, we weren't turfed out with any haste, so overall, I didn't feel like we'd overstayed.It's not a cheap price - on average, the dishes are around 7-8 squid. \u00a0However, the dishes are a good size, and 4-5 would be sufficient for two people (say, the steak and a risotto or a pasta) if you aren't in full-on splashout mode. \u00a0My mum did say that the drinks are a bit on the pricey side, but I can't really comment on those. \u00a0Minus the oysters, the bill still came out to around \u00a310 less than Ceviche (\u00a335 per head and I wasn't full afterwards), so it's relatively good value.I found it hard to believe that it wasn't a trap, but, well, it's not a trap! \u00a0It's not a trap. \u00a0It's the first time I've really enjoyed an Italian meal in London for a while, and I really appreciated how well the food is put together. \u00a0Definitely looking forward to the return trip!",

    "text": "We saw this lively bustling restaurant on a walk towards the Piccadilly underground on a Saturday night around 8:30pm/20:30. The two of us were asked if we wanted to sit by the bar and we went for it. We were seated without a wait and the bar seating was very comfortable with a purse hook under the bar and cushy seats. The service started out great, we were greeted right away and when I asked about wines he simply let me try a sample before ordering a glass. I tried one and asked for a wine with more body, and the second one was perfect.We then ordered beef tartare, a tube pasta with a sausage ragu, lobster risotto, and a special - rib eye, sweet potato and rocket. The beef tartare was pretty but came with a single layer of thin cut meat, about three slices, shaved celery, a lot of Parmesan and some rocket.Way too much cheese and not enough beef. But the quality was fine and I was happy with the celery and rocket.The tube pasta was cooked al dente and the meat sauce was very tasty- a well done dish though u get like 5 thick tubes of pasta.I was really looking forward to the risotto, but it was very disappointing. The rice was undercooked and the lobster was overcooked. The shaved truffle was a nice touch and the flavor of the dish was quite nice. But it's a little sad when my favorite component of a lobster risotto was the pan roasted grape tomatoes. The service to this point was speedy and efficient. But then there was a 15-20 minute lull. No one checked on us and our final dish was MIA. When the bartender came to clear our dishes, I asked about our last dish but he was already clearing our personal plates. I have a feeling they forgot all about our final order. He gave us new plates for our final dish which took another 7-10 minutes to come out. The ribeye was a thin cut and more medium well than medium rare. The sweet potato chips were neither crisp nor chip like - they tasted like rubbery chips when a fried item is soggified by meat juices. Finally the rocket it was served with was fine. The meat also lacked seasoning as in I don't think salt was even added. So the food was ...ok, my favorite was probably the pasta because it was cooked correctly. Finally after that they added a service charge of over 12%, I don't know if this was due to the trendy neighborhood, but be aware that they will tack on a service charge even when the service fell flat and there were just two of us. While the atmosphere was nice, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant because I think you can do better food and service wise for the prices they charge.",

Our 'board' of selected meats was excellent with the sausage being a standout (even over the lamb chops!). The second board we selected was seafood and was expertly grilled and had a nice selection that included scallops and langostino, a rare treat. The small side of pasta with bolognese sauce was outstanding. On the downside, the pizza was a sad rendition and the cocktails were *really* light given the cost. This is also a lively, loud restaurant so for diners looking for a quiet or romantic dinner, I would suggest trying somewhere else. Reservations are a must.",

For the price of the overall meal, I think the food should have been better. If you come here, save food for the Tiramisu dessert. It's actually pretty good - I'm a tiramisu connoisseur, so for it to be good, you should definitely give it a shot.The service was VERY slow... So brace yourself to wait to get your check, paid, and served.I would certainly try other places next time so I highly doubt I will be back. If I do, it will just be for the tiramisu dessert and some drinks.",

It is Italian small plates but that was the best thing as we could order a few plates and share it amongst us. The food and service was absolutely spot on.

The tables are crowded together( thus only 4 stars) so we ordered our food in waves so as not to overwhelm the space. The Queen Anne scallops and tuna tartare were the table favorites. We ordered a mixture of pizza, pasta, meat, fish and desserts. The one positive about the tables being so close, we were able to chat with the local couple sitting next to us. The risotto was amazing, and although I didn't try the grappa, my colleagues said it was some of the best. I'll be back",

Everything we ordered was good. The soup I had I'm still dreaming about. I think the menu changes often but we had salmon, soup of the day, cheese, green beans, ok just realizing I can't list it all out because we ended up going back there for dinner!

We arrived starving being up all night on the red eye from Toronto, The restaurant was nearly empty at 10:30am. The service was excellent with Italian servers busy getting ready for lunch. We chose the classic English breakfast and the eggs and smoked salmon dish. The food was very good but the real draw was the beautiful decor. Later we found out that this was a chain of restaurants and quite popular since every time we walked by they were always busy in the afternoon. They have fresh seafood on ice displayed at the front window of the restaurant. We wanted to come back for lunch or dinner but we felt that we had to try other restaurants. When in London San Carlo Cicchetti is an excellent choice.",

    "text": "Wow...just wow wow wow!!! This goes down as one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Genuinely, the whole experience was a pleasure. San Carlo Cicchetti is located literally a stones throw from Piccadilly Circus. When my friend Zoe suggested having dinner there I looked up the location and wondered what I was in store for. As soon as you step through the door way you immediately feel as if you have been transported to another place, a side street perhaps off Via Condotti in Roma. With seats at the bar we relaxed and took in the atmosphere. The staff are all Italian from what i could tell and speak to each other in Italian, when at the bar it just sets the tone wonderfully. We agreed that the overall atmosphere of the place is perfect, the background music is just below the level of the chatter and if there is a lull in conversation it fills the space. Small touch but shows an attention to detail.The restaurant concept is in a sense similar to tapas, a full Italian menu but the plate sizes are small and designed so that you can try 5 or 6 different things between two. From memory we had the calamari fritti, the truffle croquettes, spaghetti bolagnese (made to Mums recipe), gnocchi with fresh crab. For the wine we shared a love red from Puglia, its drank very smoothly and was very quaff-able .To finish I had the tiramisu which was served with a glass of marsala and Zoe the pistachio sponge cake. Both were to die for for, Zoe's description of the tiramisu said everything, \"Its so light its as if it were made by angels\"! what else can you say to that other than this is a incredible place with great staff and its the first of many visits I will be making.San Carlo Cicchetti comes Highly JD Recommened.N.B. Side note Bill Nighy was there on the same night, we were slightly star struck :o)",

    "text": "Very good Italian small plates in a fancy marble dining room in the midst of a bunch of tourist traps.I had never come to this place before it was recommended by a coworker because I always expected it to be just another tourist joint with mediocre food for too much money. \u00a0I was fortunately very mistaken.First off, the menu on the web site is not at all reflective of what they actually have in the restaurant. \u00a0There are 2x-3x more small plates available than what appears on the site, including a bunch of interesting specials. \u00a0The space is fancy bordering on gaudy, but it's all very clean and organized, so it works. \u00a0We ordered about 10 items for 3 of us for a business lunch, and while the waiter was difficult to understand, the service was good and the food came out rapidly. \u00a0The highlights for me were an octopus special, the sea bream with artichoke, and the antipasti, all of which were delicious. \u00a0No complaints about any of the others, either - their kitchen cranks out a lot of high quality plates very quickly.My only problem was with the affogato that I got for dessert. \u00a0Good affogato should be served with the gelato and the espresso separate, so that the espresso can be poured over it a little at a time and you can get the wonderful combination of hot and cold, sweet and bitter, before the whole thing rapidly turns into soup. \u00a0Ours was served all together, and it was already mostly in the latter state. \u00a0Overall, I'm settling on 4 stars, choosing to round down because despite the very good small plates, it's not really my kind of atmosphere, and I'd probably only go there with people from work.",

    "text": "We have been in London for 5 days, following our 5 days in Bath. Our favorite restaurant in England is this Italian gem. Many other restaurants have good food and efficient service, but none of them have FANTASTIC food AND service! \u00a0We first went for breakfast. Then we went for lunch. When we returned, the staff remembered us and treated us like VIP's. The menu has so many wonderful dishes to choose from. Everything is rich, fresh, homemade and delicious. Food is served Tapas style. You're encouraged to order a few plates and share. For lunch we had fresh pasta with Bolognese sauce, veal and morel mushrooms, gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce served in a parmigiana cheese bowl. Plus, beans in olive oil and lemon, and zucchini sticks. Every dish was elegant and wonderful! \u00a0We both wanted to try more dishes, but we were full. Of course we had to have dessert. As recommended, I had the pastiche tart. I would not have ordered this, but I was talked into it. It was out of this world!The coffees are great. The wine list is extensive. The mixed drink offerings look inventive and thoughtful. We are hoping to return tomorrow if time allows!The restaurant has a clean, elegant style. It's easy to get to, as the underground has the Piccadilly stop right on the corner. \u00a0We enjoy good service, and the staff at San Carlo Cicchetti is second to none! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We went again today for a late lunch. I just have to update yesterday's review. The place was hopping at 2:40pm. We were recognized and given a table at our favorite servers station. Fabrizio is a world class professional! \u00a0He welcomed us warmly and helped us plan our meal. Everything he recommended was spot-on. We indulged in 5 courses, drinks, and dessert. I had 2 versions of champagne cocktails..fabulous! \u00a0My husband had chianti. As we enjoyed each bite, we watched the workings of this busy fast-paced restaurant. There are many servers and supervisors. Nobody here has a moments down time. Constantly scanning the tables for empty glasses, plates that need replacing, and anything else diners might need. I'm telling you, it's like a highly orchestrated dance..fascinating. We just enjoyed every minute and every bite. We will miss Fabrizio and the flawless, warm, and much appreciated service he provided.",

Two plates are about the right amount for one person. The risotto lobster is ok. Nothing special. The rice is a bit raw. The lasagna has tons of cheese but it tastes pretty good. The special pasta with mussels, clams, and langoustines is interesting when this dish comes on the table, it's wrapped in a plastic bag and then they unwrap it and put on the plate. Again, the taste is ordinary and the pasta is a bit undercooked and hard. The desert that comes with 4 small desert bites for 2 and a small glass of wine is great. I like the wine and the raspberry desert the most. The service here in general is ok. Sometimes I feel that some of them have pissy face/attitude.",

I had a grilled avocado for \u00a36 that turned out to only be 1/4 th of an avocado, not the freshest or most flavorful at that. Left me feeling cheated from the get-go.Next, I tried the paparadelle parmigiana cheese and portobello mushrooms w truffle-- Okay, no truffle in it whatsoever, prob just truffle oil which we know is anything but. Then there was the mushrooms, kinda slimy and not the most flavorful. Almost no cheese grated into it. The big ribbons of paparadelle were nicely cooked however, just a minute or so beyond al dente, which always works for me. Not bad but not particularly noteworthy. Decent.The service here is extremely attentive as they hustle folks in and out but it is very good... most of the waiters are (Italian) foreigners so ordering was a little difficult but fine ultimately. I liked my affordable glass of nice and youngish montolpulciano red wine the most. That and the pretty interior. At \u00a326+ I might look elsewhere...*** / ***** from me.",

I love Italian food and I went in expecting full dishes, keep in mind these are tapas style. Quantity is little and to share! If you don't watch out it adds up pretty fast too! We got the cacio e pepe which was so good. Perfectly peppery, perfectly creamy. Also ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli which was 2 jumbo raviolis with fresh tomato sauce, why I thought was just ok. The margherita pizza reminded me of appetizer flatbread and comparable to something I'd get in the states. The service was a bit over the place, we had like 4 waiters come through but all friendly.",

Fabulous service from the minute we walked in through after dinner drinks. The reviews were good, but definitely didnt do it justice. The minute we sat down we were explained how the menu works and to share all of our options. Between us we had a salad, a specialty pasta, a regular pasta (pasta is all homemade and SO fresh) and a pizza. We probably could have fit in one more entree between us, however dessert was too tempting. We also had a bottle of the Cabernet (exceptional) and very fair prices considering its all imported Italian wine. We finished with the tiramisu (homemade I am certain) and two glasses of port. If you are a port fan, spring for the good stuff. The service was impeccable the entire time and the pizzas are stone fired in the back, so I highly recommend if you are wondering what to get. Considering this is in the middle of a very touristy area its a pleasant surprise and somewhere I will not only recommend but return to.",

My friend had the arancini, the stuffed and friend rice balls, which she loved. But I think the star of the evening was the proscuitto plate (which comes with truffle and burrata cheese). These 3 ingredients on the same plate were a match made in gastronomy heaven!!! After one bite, I wanted to hide in a corner and eat in all myself....no sharing here!!! Hehe. We also ordered the carpaccio, which was equally delicious and topped with a shaving of parmesan cheese (another great pairing by the chef). \u00a0This place is great!

Pizza dough is awful, pasta has no flavor. I don't know what's wrong with this. It's an Italian restaurant!!! But they do other dishes just fine...hmmmm",

    "text": "The place is AMAZING! \u00a0The food is served \"Tapa\" style (small plates). So they are meant to share. It is VERY authentic Italian. All the waiters and workers speak Italian too. You feel like you're in Italy. I wished we were more hungry when we went the first night, so we went back a second night just for dessert. The tiramisu and cannolis were amazing. The cannolis were served on a bed of Nutella. Is that a plus, or what?!? Just can't say enough. If you want Italian bear Picadilly, try it out. I think you'll love it!",

    "text": "Great place to drop in for Italian tapas. I ate here earlier this year and though it was good. I came back from a 2 week trip to Italy and realized this place is pretty legit. Food is great. Staff is pushy. The portion sizes are pretty small, so you really do need 5-6 dishes for 2 people. Beware of how much you order as it'll get pricey before you know it. My favorite dishes on the menu are the tagliatelle bolognas, seafood spaghetti, and steak. If you're able to order off the seasonal menu, definitely give the octopus a lobster risotto a try! The restaurant staff seem to be from Italy and give you nice warm welcomes in Italian. They sometimes come off as a bit pushy. My friend and I ordered way too much food and was not interested in dessert or coffee/tea and the server kept pressuring us to order more. You'll want to make a reservation because they get pretty packed. I came at 5:45pm, before the dinner crowd, and got seated right away, but the server definitely made it clear he was doing us a favor.",
