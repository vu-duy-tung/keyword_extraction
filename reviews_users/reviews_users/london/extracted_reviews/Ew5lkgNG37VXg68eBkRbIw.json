It wasn't great value for money but if you're catching up with friends and looking for somewhere quiet to eat then Pho is good for that as it doesn't seem to get very busy in the evenings.",

Last year I was lucky enough to work on a cookbook with experience in a professional Vietnamese kitchen in London \u00a0this rather spoilt me. Eating Vietnamese food in London can often be reminiscent of eating Indian food here in the 1970s. So, why is the restaurant PHO so bad? The banh xeo was like a hard greasy taco shell, the nuoc cham tasted like red dish water. The Pho, and noodles, and curry were vapid, with meat that tasted as if it had been frazzled-black several hours ago - like bits of old shoe leather. All in all, truly appalling food. The range of beer was good and the Saigon beer was the tastiest item on the menu by far. The staff were professional, courteous and very friendly \u00a0but he food was so bad I went home and cooked for myself.",

We don't buy in pre-packaged processed meatballs and frozen spring rolls \u00a0instead our Vietnamese chefs make everything using authentic recipes. Our pho takes up to 12 hours to prepare and it's this care that is key to the stock retaining its goodness and developing its subtle and distinctive taste.

The soups were amazing, and I loved the spicy ones, especially the spicy prawn. the noodles are excellent as well and while the menu says the noodles are cold, they most assuredly are not the mushy noodles you're thinking of and are quite hot.The restaurant is a little oddly shaped and can get very crowded during dinner time. I love the take outs, because not only are the portions MASSIVE for what you pay for, but your noodles come in tupperware. ACTUAL tupperware. Think about it, great food AND free kitchen utensils.

I've had Pho here a bunch of times and think that it's ok. But today I didn't have Pho. And I made a discovery. Pho is not what Pho is best at. Explore the menu a little more, venture off the beaten track and you'll be rewarded with some tasty surprises Goi Cuon Tom, summer rolls, were nice, although a little too noodley for me. They were freshly assembled though, full of herby flavours and the sea salty tang of prawns. The Nem Nuong though were good. Slightly crispy on the outside, they were moist and meaty without being too fatty. Lemongrass added a lovely citrussy undertone to the tasty pork. Next up salads. Vietnamese and Thai salads are a completely different proposition from their western equivalents. Properly made, they're packed full of powerful and punchy flavours, they dance sexily across your taste buds leaving them breathing hard and begging for more. Goi Xoai, a spicy green mango salad served with pork, dried shrimp and peanuts was an absolute bargain at \u00a34.50. Hot chilli, roasted nuts, pungent dried prawns and crispy pork. Wonderful, fresh and utterly reviving. This is the best dish I've had at Pho. In comparison, the Goi Du Du, a papaya salad with chicken, topped with peanuts was more of a waltz than a tango. But it was super fresh, crunchy and soothing. The perfect spring time spritzer of a light lunch. To finish I had a dense dark Vietnamese coffee. It was as strong and treacly as you could want with condensed milk adding a sweet viscosity to the tar coloured coffee If you come here and stick the Pho then be warned, you're missing out.It might not be haute Viet food, but for a lunch spot it's great. And good value for money.",

Since my visit years ago I have been to the Westfield branch which I must admit I don't find as good. The food somehow isn't as fresh tasting, and the service is \u00a0well, non-existent.I returned again tonight to the Farringdon restaurant and remembered why I loved it so much at first. Absolutely brilliant service, really friendly and attentive.As for the food itself; the fresh Vietnamese spring rolls (the non-fried, see-through kind) were great, and their special recipe chilli dipping sauce called Nouc Cham was lovely \u00a0a delicate taste but with some kick.I personally love the noodle soup with beef and meatballs, which comes with a side dish of garnishes for you to add to taste. (Chilli, beansprouts, lime, oriental basil, parsley \u00a0create your own flavours by adding to the soup.)I was also pleasantly surprised by the delicious sorbets for dessert: you wouldn't think basil and strawberry went well together, but they do.And the small shot of Vietnamese iced coffee: sickly sweet and chocolatey. Lovely.It's a low key restaurant, and definitely not a place to take someone to impress them (try any number of other restaurants on Farringdon Road for that!) but if you need to grab a quick and delicious sit-down meal with great service and good prices, Pho is an excellent choice all round.",

As soon as you walk in here your nose is \u00a0overtaken by the sweet-smelling and fragrant aroma of Vietnamese cuisine. It's more of a cafe and take away joint than a restaurant, with canteen-style tables and zippy service, but what makes it the rather more enticing are the friendly prices and extensive menu of noodle soups (pho means noodle soup if it wasn't already clear). It may not be as traditional as an up market Vietnamese diner in Chelsea but then it isn't claiming to be. It's fast, filling and heartening nosh to get you set for the afternoon's work or before an evening on the town.My favourite: Pho Chin - sliced tender roast beef noodle soup. If you take out, they give you the ingredients, the noodles and the seasonings, in separate containers to add yourself. I love this idea, reminds me a bit of the Salt 'n Shake.",

I'm happy for others that they've now opened up a new branch in Oxford Circus somewhere.

Available in various flavours (types of meat), it was quite a hit at my desk ... even the vegetarian version. The quantity was substantial. I would be surprised if a person with a normal appetite can finish off a full bowl for lunch.Tip (more to myself than to anybody else): Make sure you don't have a meeting in the afternoon, i usually end up spilling a substantial amount of the soup on my shirt :(The only drawback of this place is that it is very small and hence gets very very crowded for lunch.

The quality is usually fairly high, and that was handy, with two 'challenging' eaters (one who doesn't like spicy food, yeah, didn't figure that one out early enough, and the other a vegetarian who lives off cheese) to entertain...We went for a mixed set of starters, the summer rolls proved slightly pointless without any meat (seriously.. it's shredded lettuce and coriander in a soft rice wrapper), and the veggie spring rolls were crispy and slightly chewy on the outside, with a coating like a Macdonalds apple pie. But I'm a sucker for the special, and there were two to try that don't appear on the daytime menu. The slivers of tofu and mushroom in a sharing (sized) crepe snapped with unami, though the crepe had the texture (and oily touch) of a sheet of grilled cheese on the bottom of an oven tray (the veggie cheesehound was delighted). My main was another evening 'special', a slightly too soupy Cari Ga (chicken curry) served with rice and it wasn't great. A very creamy light sauce with way too much sugar and coconut for me (and way too little chilli heat)... I knew I should have stuck with their simple and clean Bun noodles.The others adored it, but I've definitely had better from them...",

The venue is small so we had to wait about 15 minutes for an area to clear, and there wasn't anywhere to stand where you weren't in someone's way. On a positive note, you can order take away and bring it back to the office if you work nearby. Once we sat down and have ordered, the food arrived within minutes. The bun noodles had the authentic flavour, even if it was more water-y than I am used to (but that's good, I love sauce!). The staff was absolutely enthusiastic, helpfully explaining the menu and recommending us things to try since we haven't been before. I did think that price is a little bit on the high side for 'street-food,' but the authentic flavour and its location helps make up for it.",

This is the base of every good Vietnamese soup, \u00a0especially pho. If you cannot master the broth, just don't even bother with the rest. - The noodles. Pho noodles are thin, soft, and often times translucent. The noodles here are wide, thick, and they suck. - The meat. Not enough, and not tender. - The condiments. The hoison sauce was ok, but I don't understand how a pho restaurant can even operate without the real Sriracha chili paste. BY THE WAY, I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and not the Pho. How do I know what the pho tastes like then, you ask? Because they screwed my BBH up and made it exactly identical to the Pho and still managed to have me notice how bad their pho would have been if I had ordered it. On top of it all, the service sucked, the wait was long, and the place is too cramped. If they offered quality pho, none of this would be a big deal, but of course, they do not. If you are wondering, 'Pho' is on par with Cafe VN, which is down the street on Clerkenwell. Both should shut their doors. So there you go, a two for one whammy Yelp! review. You are welcome.",

There is also Bun (vermicelli noodles and toppings) as well as some very yummy Viertnamese curry!At 7.45 for a good bowl of Pho Tai, this is a perfect place for a quick lunch or dinner.For lunch I had Goi Cuon Tom, which was delicious and freshly wrapped along with a bowl of Pho Tai Chin.

We had a great waitress - - to whom girlfriend and myself played the game of trying to guess where she was from since we knew she wasn't English but could not pick out a distinct accent. Being tall and blonde I went the Scandanavian route while girlfriend absurdly thought Irish - - we were both wrong when she told us she hailed from Krawkow, Poland.Anyways - - ordered the Rare Beef Pho - - and let me tell you I was quite impressed with the aroma and flavors which arose from that big bad bowl. Along with a extensivly large wooden spoon and chopsticks in hand - - we both went to town. Needless to say this place is great - cool decor, great food, friendly service, and located quite near my flat.Recommended to Pho lovers anywhere.",

Put my main in a bowl and we're generally going to have issues, fool. It's not that I'm not adventurous with my food choices - i'll eat anything apart from tripe - it's just that habits are a hell of a thing to break.Here I ate a bowl of beef Pho for my main, that's beef with noodles and broth. Though simple is was deliciously filling. Welcome soul food for a weary stomach. Starters was a simple salad sprinkled with nuts and some six pastries in which tender slices of roast pork were hiding. Dessert was a three scoop sorbet affair including lime, mango and coconut. Again, here i once again strayed off my gastronomic path but again, I enjoyed being lost. In short, I appreciated the simplicity of it all.For that reason, Pho is going to form part of my on-going culinary rehab routine. Reasonably priced and clean, there is nothing to offend here and therefore, it's worth another look. PS - It's quite a squeeze passing by the close tables especially after eating, so you'll have to get your Kanye Workout Plan in check.",

They handed me a legit laddle- not the Asian spoon mind you, but a legitimate laddle. I don't even know what to say, am I supposed to eat with it? No. Just no. I got Pho, it was absolutely terrible. Broth was fatty and bland AND dark. Beef was not right. Hoisin has to be asked to be brought to your table (whyyyyy? It's like going to a coffee shop and having to ask for milk. Why?). There was no Thai Basil served with the Pho. There was not enough bean sprout. And what else, com tam (broken rice) doesn't come with the fish dipping sauce. Yes, I repeat. Com tan doesn't come with dipping sauce. So what the hell am I supposed to eat it with? I can't even. I don't even know what to do. I will never return to this place and I regret spending money here. The service was nice though. Hence 2/5 stars.",

The broth was so rich in taste, it was the best bun rieu I've ever had besides of course my mom's. Prices are okay, service good! Next time I'll try the pho",

Best to get here early for a table especially during lunch rush hour. Everything is described properly on the menu, as it was so cold today I opted for the Ph t\u00f4m with a veggie broth. Base broth of lemongrass, ginger, lime and different veggies with tiger prawns. A large bowl was placed in front of me with thick noodles and extra side of veggies for the noodle soup. I was impressed by the size, not so impressed on the bland broth. I added the garlic vinegar, extra lime, chilli oil and paste and sirarcha sauce to it. Then it was much better! The extra herbs of mint and coriander really helped to bring out the flavours. As I couldn't finish it, they packed it up for me in a secure tub which was then tied inside a plastic bag to prevent spillage. They also kindly added extra prawns which are \u00a31.75 extra and the veggies are an extra \u00a31.00. Overall a nice place for Vietnamese food. It's more of a street food style menu, but nonetheless still tasty and value for money.The staff are nice too!",

It's very clean and well kept in here, when downstairs and the toilets are nice to visit. Not that I'd go there for that, but it's nice when you go and it's not grubby!Our servers were very friendly, and upon hearing my friend had never had Vietnamese he explained the menu and made some suggestions.I had a fantastic chicken and prawn crispy pancake thingy which you wrap in this rice paper or something. It was absolutely delightful with great portion sizing and very reasonable pricing. Full of flavours and fresh, is thoroughly recommend this place to anyone and would like to go again!",

The restaurant is small and busy - it's on the crowded side rather than intimate - but the noise level was bearable and the service was very fast. I gather it is very busy after work, so dining a little later may help. Expect to wait for a bit at peak times.We tried the hot and cold (summer) veggie rolls for starters, and then I had the tofu and mushroom bun noodles. The food was delicious - especially the noodles, and the ginger soy I was provided with made a stunning accompaniment. Interestingly, the beers (Saigon and Lao) were great companions for the food.A nice feature was our very helpful waiter who pointed out which \u00a0sauces I could have as a vegetarian (ie avoiding the fish sauce).",

This is just the amount of time it would take to go someplace else and thus worth waiting it out, plus a server clearly tried to persuade a couple who had paid and were just chatting, to move on. The aroma coming out of the kitchen was tantalizing and by the time we were seated we had decided on our orders. He had the chicken broth w an egg and tofu with mushrooms while I opted for the spicy noodle soup w all the mushrooms and eko Choy, a cousin to bok Choy. We started w some rice paper glass noodles w prawns which came out promptly and were v tasty. Unfortunately the combo of being seated next to a drafty window and the long wait between app and main cost Pho a star. The mains were v tasty indeed and generously sized. The tofu was fried rather than soft but the noodles and enoki were amazing and the broth could do no wrong. V affordable price points for high quality eats. Can't wait to return for more.",

It was so good I actually ordered a second bowl.That is the feeling I want to get and is the benchmark for me to discover not a good, but a great Pho.

I had the crispy spring rolls (cha gio) which is very good and authentic when it comes down to the actual rice roll wrap that they use to the filling with the ground pork and mushroom strings. Very Vietnamese and down to the T! Nice texture and awesome flavor. This is 5 out of 5. I will give the Pho 3.5 out of 5. The 'bo vien' meatballs was nothing spectacular, it feels like a housemade ground beef rolled up with no real chewy texture and flavor. The 'nam' (brisket) could be softer, but still had a nice texture. It's always a plus here in London to see a Pho establishment giving you Hue (basil) and sufficient amounts of bean sprouts. The meat could be more tender, but I've tried a lot worse here in London.The service was great, everyone was friendly and prompt for a Saturday night service. The restaurant is fairly clean for a Vietnamese joint. But then again - I grew up knowing that when it's too clean, it's not that authentic.I will definitely come back again on a cold, windy, and wet day here in London.",
