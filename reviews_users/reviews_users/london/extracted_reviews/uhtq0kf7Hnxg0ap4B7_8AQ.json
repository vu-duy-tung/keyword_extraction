Im now a fan of Franco Manca!!!!!",

Long wait (about an hour) - expected to be honest, but they have an excellent reservation system, where you can check your spot in line via your smartphone browser!Food is quick and cheap. Hot fired oven pizza, though pretty well made. I actually thought our pizza was undercooked a bit, and a bit doughy in the middle, but overall it was quite good. While the menu is small everything is simple and well done. No frills.Service is great, because the turnover is so high, they are always around and moving quickly. For the price, this is a great value. For fairly cheap, good pizza, in a central location this is the place to go.",

Service was quick, friendly and attentive. The pizza special was a 'meat special' which arrived at my table in less than 10 minutes. It was really very, very good. I'm not a fan of wafer thin pizza bread preferring mine on the doughy side and this didn't disappoint. The pizza base was piping hot, slightly crusty with that satisfying bulge around the rim to really get the teeth into. The topping was a number of different meat slices which, to be honest, was ok but the bread made it for me. Less than 10 quid and in and out in well under an hour. On the bookmarked list for future London jaunts.",

However, the chili oil, garlic oil, and olive oil in the middle of the tables really do add a lot to the pizza, I would be sure to add some to taste. All in all, the pizza was decent for the price. In terms of personal preference I would have preferred more substance (in the form of dough cheese toppings, etc), however that is mostly my fault for going to a thin crust sour dough pizza place.",

    "text": "I'm not a pizza person, at least that's what I used to think before I started studying the art of the neapolitan pizza for months. This place is the real deal. They use slow rise sourdough that had the right texture, taste, and chew that was baked in a wood fired oven. The chef even domed (raising the pizza to the top of the oven where the heat and smoke is) the final 5 seconds to give it that finishing touch. I ordered the most basic, cheapest (the best deal in my opinion), first item on the menu: Tomato, garlic, oregano 4.95 pounds. ($6.50ish). The tomato sauce was fresh and bright. The garlic wasn't burnt. The oregano came through. Make sure you drizzle with the chili oil or olive oil that are on the tables. I got mine take away and walked the streets of Soho with pizza box on one hand and a slice in the other. I walked by a homeless man and sat down with him to split the pie. Food tastes better when shared. That pizza was more than I could eat alone, yet I enjoyed every bite. In a world filled with mediocre to cardboard tasting pizzas, this is the epitome of what a pizza should be. I ordered a pizza oven for my backyard. I'm using this as a base to measure all my pizzas that I'll be making from scratch.",

    "text": "Famed for their sourdough which gives their pizzas a unique taste, Franca Manca is basic yet pleasant. The menu is simplistic and rather limited in variety of both food and drink. Nevertheless, some additional toppings can be added to the pizzas and look out for their specials board for more savoury options, dessert possibilities and other extras. Helpfully, a non-cheese pizza can be chosen and personalised with your preferred toppings if you have a vegan or dairy-free diet.This branch of Franca Manca had efficient service, somewhat cramped seating, only one stall for a womens' toilet and had slightly burnt the rims of the pizza crust. The texture of the wild mushrooms tasted fresh, the tomato sauce juicy but the base too thin for my liking. Even the sharper knife design did not go unnoticed and was greatly appreciated as I find that pizzas can often be difficult to cut with an average blunt knife.All-in-all dining here was convenient and satisfying but nothing much to rave about.",

The ingredients are top notch and the anchovies were excellent. The cost of a basic pizza is very reasonable at \u00a36 to start. The homemade lemonade looked great and will have to try it. Will be back for sure. Only downside was no soda options.",

I mostly wear dresses or skirts, so my chilly legs ain't got no time for that! However, now they have been around for a while, the queue seems to have calmed down (at least on Monday nights- yay!)I looove:- The sourdough bases were perfect! I often leave the crust of my pizza if they are dry and boring...but I ate every crumb of this! Seriously...the crusts were crunchy, yet soft and doughy. They were even better drizzled in a little chilli oil. Yum.- They only have a few options for toppings, but both of the pizzas we tried were lovely.- The wine wasn't too pricey, but tasted good.- It is really affordable! \u00a37ish for a huuuge pizza. Even with wine I spent less than \u00a311!!This was better than ICCO. You can't get better pizza-praise than that. *I still wouldn't wait in line for an hour though!*",

(Got one small table in the corner empty) since our table was in the corner I guess we were kinda forgotten by the servers. Waited for about 20 mins for the waiter to show up. You can basically make your own pizza here and add any number of toppings which are available. The pizza dough here is so soft and moist. I guess it's way different \u00a0than NYC PIZZA. I would not recommend this restaurant to someone who needs fancy decor or want to come on a date night as this place can get pretty noisy with so many people around. Loved the food but would not say their service was top notch.",

Great simple menu with awesome bases, a great tasting pizza and enough to satisfy any pizza lover. The lemonade is great and the starter menu is a tasty treat before the pizza arrives.The prices are another great point about Franco Manca and whether you are grabbing a quick bite to eat or sitting down to really enjoy the evening, you won't have a big bill! The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is that the service could be better. The first time we ate here, they forgot our starter, the next time they forgot our lemonades and another time, we made a mistake on our order which we quickly corrected with the waiter and if looks could kill....I would not be writing this review. It seems at some places it's fashionable to not care but a smile and excellent service goes a long way! Great pizza, great location, pay them a visit!",

Menu is simple, good for those who cant make a decision on what to eat! lol . I thoroughly enjoyed the pizza no. 4, 5, 6... but the one with salted fish/ antichoke is a bit salty for my taste. Sourdough crust was easy to eat. me and my mates also ordered 3 ice cream. They are 2.5 pounds per scoop, but they do not have desert menu there, we have to ask the staff for it. They have raspberry, vanilla and chocolate, and they also have brownie and lemon cake.",

My MIL was struggling and the waitress wouldn't bring out a slicer or offer any help. Very strange... Also, they DO NOT OFFER VEGAN CHEESE. It came up in my search for vegan pizza and was the sole reason I chose this place for 5 people. That said, the pizza was still amazing so just know this going in. You'll need to order without cheese. Worth noting: very busy, extremely hot upstairs due to the ovens, and loud. Not great if bringing an older group along but probably fine for younger people.",
