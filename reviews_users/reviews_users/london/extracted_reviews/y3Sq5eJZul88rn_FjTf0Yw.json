    "text": "I think the alarm bells should've started ringing after the 40 minute wait for the table. However like lambs in line at the abbatoir we trudged towards our doom. After such a long wait you would've thought that the staff would be trying to win back some brownie points, well you thought wrong. After another 6 or 7 minutes waiting I gave up and got menu's for everyone from the waiter station myself. We made our decision and placed our order, then we waited, and we waited and when we were tired of waiting, well we waited some more. Eventually our food arrived and the waitress who served us was the rudest person I have ever come across, reprimanding my wife and our friends for leaving their bags next to the table. 'You can't leave your bag there, put it under the table you're making it really difficult for me'. Urmm, excuse me? My wife did as she was commanded but this left no more room, the waitress then proceeded to tut, mutter under her breath and kick the remaining bag before saying 'you'll have to take this I can't reach now'. I have to say I was suprised at the 'Jungle curry'. It was a clear broth like substance with 5 small pieces of chicken floating in it along with some small quartered limes and so much ginger cut into little sticks it looked driftwood from a shipwreck. Okay, so that is not exactly what I recognise as a jungle curry, and I have eaten this dish in South East Asia, but hey ho I thought, lets give it a go. Well I have to assume that they dumped the entire contents of a salt shaker into it by accident and decided to serve it to me anyway, it was totally inedible. When I explained this to the waitress and said I didnt want a replacement dish as it had taken so long to arrive in the first place she refused to take it, and instead got the manager and several other waiters who proceeded to have a team huddle right next to me to discuss it. Eventually this resulted in them taking the dish away. I'll be honest I have never really taken to the conveyor belt dining experience that is Busaba, it is impersonal, noisy and generally pretty unpleasant. This however was the final straw for me and I wont be going back, but I'm sure they wont notice the loss of my custom when people are literally queuing up to be treated like cattle. Just to clarify the 2 stars are for the 2 dishes my wife ordered which I ended up sharing and were very nice, not however nice enough to go back, goodbye forever Busaba Eathai.",

    "text": "Very affordable and tasty Thai food. I'd seen this chain (10 restaurants in London) recommended in various places and I'd say it's a great alternative to the blander, overpriced fare on offer at Wagamama and co. The food here is very reasonably priced (lots of dishes under \u00a37 which really impressed me) and my chicken and lemongrass soup, as recommended by another review, was excellent (except for when I bit into something hard and bitter thinking it was a potato. It was not). My friend loved his chargrilled duck dish, which did indeed taste great.It also has a slightly nicer decor and atmosphere than the more canteen like versions and service was efficient and attentive. These restaurants tend to be in locations, e.g. Westfield, close to Covent Garden, where a lot of the food on offer is mass produced, sub par and at premium prices - if you find yourself in that situation - head here!",

The food is good but quite over-priced in my opinion, about \u00a310 for a portion of Pad Thai that doesn't even fill you up?! Their duck main is lovely, but again, very pricey as you need a side order and altogether it comes up to about \u00a319. Service is okay, the waitresses tends to be slightly rude and during busy lunch/dinner hours it can get very noisy in there. But, food does have some good flavours and everything tastes fresh so three stars for that.",

    "text": "I'm reading the consistently poor reviews of this particular location of Busaba Eathai and I'm sorry fellow yelp diners, my experience was a good one. *Ducks underneath desk*I'm not really a fan of chain restaurants, especially when they warp the cuisine to match the western palate. Thai food is meant to be fragrant, bold, illuminating...and coconut rice is among my favorite things to eat, ever, so, of course, I'm going to rave about Thai food as if it's the most brilliant thing on the planet.First, they have a weird reservations policy. So, we couldn't book on a busy night but thankfully for a Friday, in the heat of the dinner rush, we were seated. Communal dining isn't my thing but with the right people, we're able to have a chat and forget that we're eating at the same table as some man in a suit who does things with his Sriracha that are too obscene to mention.We skipped starters and headed for mains. The vegetarian choices (for diners like me) are idiotically limited. If you want something added to a dish, it's impossible, the staff says. If you want something taken away, however, it's their pleasure. Portions are irrationally small. I was so hungry after eating my pad thai jay that I had to order a side dish and rice to soothe my hunger pangs and ultimately looked like Miss Piggy to the rest of the table. I wouldn't ever claim that this is authentic Thai fare but I wouldn't say it's the worst either. We cleaned our plates and enjoyed our food but this is a Thai place I'd visit in a pinch, not as a first choice. There is room for improvement but it was a quick, easy dinner and one can't complain too much without reservations on a Friday night.",

We were walking through covent garden and dropped in for dinner at this location. \u00a0Mistake. We ordered \"starters\" from the menu. \u00a0The main arrived first. No big deal, we can live with that. But when we asked the server about our starters, he replied 'we don't do starters.' \u00a0Well, the menu says 'starters.' \u00a0The vegetable curry was tasty as always, but there just a few measly vegetable bits floating in an ocean of liquid. When the tom kha chicken soup starter artived for our party of 3, we had no bowls. The server suggested that patrons all eat from the same bowl. \u00a0The soup was bland coconut milk, lukewarm and free of flavor, as if the kitchen forgot an ingredient or two. Duck was good. Squid also good, as were the fishcakes. \u00a0Staff at this location require training, management, and attitude adjustment. We will be avoiding this location.",

Aye, muchachos !!! It was amazingly good, not at all dry as I had feared, a true blessing from Asia ! The spice was elegantly matched by my Nam polamai fruit juice, which made the whole dinner yet another very pleasant Busaba experience to tell about !",

The dear they gave me was right where the waitresses kept knocking into me. One of the side dishes was so late after me reminding them about the order only for it to arrive under cooked.

I had a coconut / lemongrass soup the second time which was really, really tiny portions, but did not wish to order anything else.

They have a pretty good menu, although I actually found that there weren't quite enough choices. I'm used to thai restaurants having a pretty extensive list of noodles & main dishes, but Busaba's left me wanting more to choose from. Service was okay, but I was definitely left to my own devices on more than one occasion. I asked for some spicy sauce from someone who wasn't my waiter and got nothing. To eat, I had some spring roles, which were tasty; an order of roti; and smoked chicken noodles (Smoked chicken vermicelli noodle, Chinese broccoli and egg). Add a ginger tea to that meal and you're pretty much satisfied for 20 quid. I'd say it's good, not great. Worth a try to formulate your own opinion!",

They seem to have invented lots of \"fusion\" dishes, and have hardly any Thai staples aside from pad thai. But I want to see some pad see ew, and there's no Thai iced tea either!

    "text": "What with the British summer rain and clouds destroying our plans to go up to the top of the shard on my birthday at the time we wanted we were pretty much left to fill the time with eating. I fancied Thai food and after reading the reviews we ended up here. I was not disappointed despite there not even being a hint of Thai iced tea anywhere, which must be an American invention. We started with the prawn crackers and Bellinis and homemade lemonade. Their list of drinks is extensive and creative, though the portions are somewhat smallish.We wanted the roti bites but sadly we were out of luck as they didn't have any. Instead we ordered two mains, more than enough for two of us to share at lunch.The beautifully presented tamarind duck was amazing and I would order this 10 times over for the tangy sauce alone. The side order of sticky rice that came in a cute little woven box was a good accompaniment.We also ordered the sen chan pad Thai dish which was good and had a completely different flavour profile but it was not as memorable as the duck. There was just about enough meat in there and the shrimps had been properly prepped, so I wasn't eating fish poop, yay :)If I was to go again I would definitely order the duck again and then perhaps try another new dish or two. The decoration is modern and the ambience is relaxed. You are sitting on benches at large square tables that could seat up to 12 friends and maybe 8 strangers. So yes you may well be eating right up close to someone you don't know but I personally love that cause I like eaves dropping!I can't remember a desserts menu but if they do one I bet it's creative.",

    "text": "I avoided Busaba Eathai for years after several underwhelming experiences paired with my dislike of communal-style dining. However, I was in search for an affordable option on a Friday night in central London and discovered that Time Out cardholders receive 50% off of their food bill here- valid any day- so I put my prejudices aside.We visited the Covent Garden location and were greeted by the ubiquitous Busaba queue- a permanent fixture outside of their Soho branch in particular- but were seated almost immediately. We ordered prawn crackers to graze on and some drinks- the crackers were moorish and a satisfying complement to a cold beer. They were more scampi fries than the bland, Styrofoam variations often proffered to diners in Asian restaurants. The sweet chili sauce appeared to have come from a bottle and was uneventful.We then had issues with our drinks- I was brought the wrong order and had to ask twice before this was rectified. My boyfriend was happy that they offered a selection from Five Points Brewery, but he was given a glass that had obviously just come out of the washing machine- he fortunately prefers to drink from a bottle!The most astounding moment arrived with our mains when our server asked if we could manage with chopsticks and spoons- she explained that they were out of clean forks. This didn't cause me any consternation with my noodles, but my boyfriend felt that his curry required more practical utensils. We sent the waiter on a hunt for a fork while we eyed up our dinner.The food was average- my pad kwetio was billed as a spicy dish of flat noodles, smoked chicken, shitake mushrooms and prawns. In reality, it was a slick nest of noodles that lacked any real heat and was very sparing on the chicken. The king prawns were the highlight, perfectly plump and meaty and had somehow avoided soaking up the oiliness of their surroundings.My boyfriend's songkhla red curry arrived swimming in an aromatic broth and looking more appetizing than my meal. Sticky rice was required on the side because none was offered with the main. The ingredients of the curry were a bit sparse- the hunks of beef were generous, but there was a lack of tomatoes and peppers, which would add vivacity and visual interest to the dish. The flavours were good, however, and there was a discernible hint of heat.Service was sluggish and disorderly throughout the meal and there was muddling over our bill- our server accepted the Time Out card without any issue, but we had to request the bill several times. When it did arrive, he had already forgotten about the discount and it had to be recalculated. In the end, the meal and drinks came to \u00a322.33, which I can't fault for a central London meal on a Friday evening.The central locations of Busaba Eathai are best avoided because the service suffers as a consequence of how busy they are. If you do visit a Busaba, the curries are a flavoursome choice, but don't expect more than a barebones version. If you're not in a rush, you are advised to track down an authentic Thai restaurant, as there are some wonderful and affordable gems all over the city.",

Normally they are quite heavy for uour stomach because if the fry but this time they were quite delecate.Regarding the noodles: they were nice but not great. I mean i have eaten noodles that were more tasty than those ones.A friend of mine took noodles with shrimp. They were spicy and tasty. I think next time i will take shrimps ones.By the way i think prices might be a little lower (we spent 25\u00a3 each one and we were 6 eating the same stuff)I will definitely eat there another time.",

I'm glad... instead ended up at one of their family style tables. They have an extensive menu, at very reasonable prices - including special group and lunch menus. I ordered some new spicy coconut broth, chicken, noodle and vegetable soup plus Thai chicken wings.l and the obligatory Asian beer to go with.All of it was fantastic. The soup came in a huge bowl and was loaded with chicken, mushrooms etc (instead of just noodles) I couldn't finish it - even though I ate far more than I should. Ended up taking the wings home with me for dinner. Everyone at my table lived their own choices.It was packed with people, but after a slow start the service was attentive the service was attentive and friendly.This is a great, affordable Thai spot \u00a0if u r visiting London and craving some spicy goodness- conveniently located right near covent garden.",

Sort of the darker sexier Wagamama, but I enjoyed myself none the less. Had the prawn chilli rice, which was great but a lot more kick than I had planned.

The only dish I actually like is the sen chan pad thai, but find it a little pricey for a dish that is essentially wok-fried noodles. I've tried a couple of their dishes and found most of them to be average. All are good enough for a casual meal with friends or when you just need to get a fix of Thai cuisine. But if you're craving delicious Thai food, I'd look elsewhere. So, 3 stars from me.",

    "text": "I've dined at other Busabas and found the service and food quite good, so when planning an evening at the theatre for a large group I was delighted to find that I could make a reservation for 10 people at this location. The food was just as good as I remembered- the duck curry in particular is a total star. However, the service was so incredibly abysmal that I cannot recommend this restaurant to any future diners.Upon arrival we were seated at our giant table and then promptly ignored for 20 minutes. No menus, no, drink orders, nothing. I had to go find a waiter and ask him to please provide us with the pre-theatre menu (which is listed on their website), and my request was met with utter confusion. Finally after consulting with multiple other waiters and the manager they rustled up some pre-theatre menus that were completely different from what was listed on the website (from which everyone had already chosen their meals). Okay, menu had changed, we reassessed and decided on new orders.25 minutes into our 'meal' we now at least had menus but still no waiter in sight, as the one who had given us our menus claimed he couldn't take our orders because he wasn't the assigned waiter (cue vague gesture towards that back of the restaurant where no waiters were to be seen), and made no effort to alert our 'assigned waiter' that we were ready to order. I had to stand up and go ask the manager to please come take our order as we had a show to get to and were all getting quite hangry at this point. Our waiter finally materializes and takes everyone's orders, then comes back 10 minutes later and says that actually they are not accepting the pre-theatre menu so can we all please choose different entrees. Are you kidding me? Luckily the manager bustled over after seeing the combination of anger and hunger on my face and he told us that the waiter was mistaken and that they are running the pre-theatre menu and he will put in our order. The food arrived 10 minutes later and it was yummy and and we were finally able to fill our growling tummies. What I don't understand is that this restaurant is quite small and they had more than enough wait staff to handle the number of guests, so they clearly are putting zero effort into training and preparing the staff. It's a definite shame because the food has so much potential!",
