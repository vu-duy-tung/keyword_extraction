    "text": "Dear Da Mario,I wanted to let you know that you are really good at getting me interested in coming into your establishment. You provided a bright neon sign promoting DISCO Pizza; and to add to that, it's Princess Diana's \"favourite\" place for a pie. Once I looked at the menu, I further realized you're the guy that created to pizza for Pizza Express, which fed me and saved me on numerous occasions when I first came to London.You proved your masculinity with the giant establishment, featuring a good sized room on the ground floor and a sprawling downstairs area that was hustling and bustling. However, this is where your epic fail began. Despite you promptly seating our group of six people, you put us in an unoccupied area that was nice for us as we could actually hear each other talking, but no one came to take our orders, ever.For the love of Princess Di, one of the people in our group had her arms waving in the air trying to get the employees walking in and out of our rooms attention. This kept on for twenty minutes. 20 minutes, you ignored us. We were all ready to give you our orders of Diana's Disco Pizza Express Pizza, but no, you snubbed us. So, when our collective patience left, so did we. Right out the door, back past several of your employees that ignored us and we left. I will never come back to you Da Mario, in fact, every time I go to Pizza Express now, I will curse your name and repeat \"never again.\" In all honesty, not even the people at the place that cannot ever be mentioned had better service and a better attitude.Sincerely,Yelper #3 of 5 that you pissed off all at once",

Outside on the steps, it boasts Princess Diana's pizzeria. Err yeah. Inside, the bustling restaurant was full of people enjoying pizza and wine, as you do. We were offered the choice of a table in the path of serious wind chill from the door or downstairs. Downstairs, they seemed to have a few rooms and we were gestured towards an empty one that felt like a train station waiting room. And we waited... and waited. Eventually we got menus and all picked delicious sounding dishes. Broccoli on pizza? I'm in! What was most annoying was that there was a waitress coming in and out of the room with us, totally blanking our attempts to call her over. Wo - ow. Worst service ever. So we left.",

Sometimes a server would poke her head in, and we would frantically wave, but no dice. Not even drinks. I offered to get up and go find the server. We decided instead to all get up and go find somewhere else to eat.It's noted out front that this was Princess Di's favorite pizza place, but I bet that Di used to actually get her order taken. I, on the other hand, had to leave without getting to try either their disco or their pizza.",

Thank goodness for their chance encounter because the pizza here is a delight! The pizza crust is really, really thin, and light, and the flavors are just bursting. I just wanted to keep eating and eating and eating. The individual pizzas are all pretty huge (in my opinion), and I left feeling very full and completely satisfied. For dessert, my friends ordered a tiramisu and a tartufo nero (a ball of sort of whipped custard enveloped in chocolate ice cream, crushed hazelnuts, and cocoa powder... OHMYGOSH so good). Our servers weren't particularly attentive, which was irritating when we needed refills on our drinks and our bill. Regardless, I'm sure we'll be back again.",

On the downside, the music is a bit too loud; and the waiter mystified me with the question of whether two plates of pasta, two glasses of red and a plate of garlic bread was all my companion and I required (in the event this proved more than enough!). It's also small, which is a disadvantage when you've got so many guests. And boy was it crowded! I was prescient to book ahead to eat after 7 pm on a Saturday night; later on we saw some people turned away and others queuing outside because there were no tables available. Because it was so busy, in the end it didn't matter that the music was so loud. Anyway, this is a testament to how good their food is. And not too expensive too - the final bill was just under 50 quid including desserts. The small room in a house masquerading as an Italian palazzo is filled with various bric a brac of dubious provenance, some of it apparently celebrating Diana the Princess of Wales who used to be a regular here. But I suspect all these people have a more important reason to flock here; and that's food. Well done.",

The gnocchi is out of this world... I would totally recommend this to anyone who's visiting the area. I never had the pizza though, even though that's what they're \"famous for\" after having the gnocchi with the mozzarella cheese baked on, I could never even think about ordering anything else!",

I mean, on a mushroom pizza in a \"quality\" Italian, I don't expect tinned 'shrooms. Is that too picky? Anyway, the sauce was OK (verging on bland) and there was a LOT of cheese.

You'll see families, date nights, and those tourists drawn by Princess Diana's recommendation at Da Mario. We made a reservation the first time and of course had no wait time, without one expect up to 20-30 min on busier nights. There is an upstairs area and a downstairs, so there is plenty of room for walk-ins. It looked like the downstairs area could also accommodate very large parties, and the small bar downstairs was nice to wait at as well.Friendly staff (for Italians), always prompt with service, and the food is really well made. I have never had a problem with the service here, but have never come with a group over 4 people. All in all, an enjoyable spot with good food. Also try the chocolate chip and vanilla ice cream for dessert!",

We ordered the ciabatta and caprese salad as a starter, pizza / pasta for entree, and Tiramisu for dessert. All the food was really fresh and delicious. The balsamic vinegar was particularly interesting (and tasty) as it was probably the thickest I have ever had. The staff was really friendly and on top of it. Next time we are in London we will definitely be making our way here.",

I do have a small fascination with Princess Diana but it wasn't the main factor that convinced me to try this place. No, the main factor was that I often had visitors who were picky eaters so I had to find something that was pretty standard for them. Da Mario was it. The food was delicious! Excellent Italian and they even gave us limoncello one night when we were celebrating a birthday! The reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the service wasn't particularly attentive. Sometimes, they forgot to give us out food or didn't give us what we ordered. But I'm usually not a stickler for things like that because, hopefully when I go out, I'm with people whose company I enjoy!!! If you're just going for the food, it's well worth it!",

Then I saw they are mostly from one group, and what restaurant doesn't have an off day here and there?It wasn't the Princess Diana thing that drew my fellow Americans and me there, it was the proximity to our flat, the proximity to our fav pub, and the decent prices that we liked. I also thought the pizza was really tasty and the wine was cheap... I went there with girlfriends for dinner and drinks quite a few times and always had a great time. My friend had her birthday party in the room downstairs and the staff was really attentive and everyone got their food promptly. I like Da Mario's!!",

Aside from the cheesy painting of Mario serving a pizza to Princess Diana (apparently it was her favourite place too), you get really friendly service and excellent quality food.If you're unlucky you'll have to sit downstairs, where it's sometimes more smelly and it feels like a different kind of restaurant, as it's much bigger downstairs and not as cosy. The food is still good though :)",

We were a big group and ordered a ton of food - and must say it arrived promptly. Half of us had pizzas and half of us pasta, and the Arrabbiata, the Amatriciana and the Seafood linguine were really actually great. The pizza was good but not outstanding and the tiramisu was pretty good but not great. There was too much whipped cream and not enough mascarpone. But all in all, a good italian place, I would go again.",

    "text": "My first dinner in London and I'd consider it a major success! I scoured Yelp for a restaurant within walking distance of my hotel in order to get a head start exploring the city as it should be explored--on foot. Eventually I came upon Da Mario Restaurant which stood out when I read that Princess Diana is fond of this otherwise inconspicuous Italian spot. Walking up to Da Mario, it's chilly, but you can still see diners sitting on the patio and lights twinkling as the sun sets. The atmosphere is romantic, but lively. We started with a Fantasia di Bufala, which consisted of buffalo mozzarella, greens and tomato accompanied by olive oil and a sweet balsamic reduction. It was simple and well done, but the mozzarella wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped it to be. I'd probably pass on this dish if I were to return. The Pappardelle Ragu was absolutely delicious. The flat wide pasta noodles were homemade and cooked to a perfect al dente. The ragu was essentially large chunks of fork tender beef in a tomato based sauce. I finished every last bite. My dining companion ordered the Pappardelle Aurora and also was blown away so I'd say you can't go wrong with one of the handful of Pappardelle dishes on the menu. Da Mario also gets a feather in it's cap for the extra generous wine pours! This spot is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.",

    "text": "I'll sum it up in one line - Princess Di had GREAT taste! (The princes is said to have dined here and this was her favorite pizza place in the neighborhood - several mementos on the walls pay homage to her)At Da Mario restaurant, everything from the bread to the mains and desert was simply excellent. If you're looking for a no fuss, high on taste meal in central London that wont break the bank, this is it. We started with some focaccia bread that was perfectly warmed and crisp to dip in the two types of olive oils that were on each table - regular and chili. Yumm,This was followed by Prawns Aglio Oglio - delicately spiced and grilled to perfection, these garlicky open faced prawns were a hint of how excellent the rest of the meal was to be. I got the Pappardelle Pasta - cream sauce with spinach, garlic, toasted pine nuts, parmesan and fresh basil. For a change every single ingredient in this list was in the dish and what's more you could taste it in every bite. This has to be one of the most well-balanced pasta's I've ever had. The sauce was just right - creamy, but not too overpowering or drenched in cream that you couldn't taste anything else. Excellent. The husband opted for the Charcoal grilled sea bass fillet, baby squid, king prawn dish that was served with a side salad of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes. I tasted the fish and it had a melt-in-the-mouth type of freshness to it and the crispy bed of salad was excellent as well. To round it all of, we shared the Caramel Custard and I had a decaf espresso - the coffee was decadent and the desert was gently soothing and delightful.Not withstanding the fame that came with the late Princess dining here, the prices are modest and the portions generous. I was a tad skeptical of visiting this restaurant because of the celebrity tag associated with it, but everything including the service was great. Highly recommend you visit De Mario if you get a chance!",

So anyway we booked a table for 5 here but still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated (and we were 5 mins late). The place is very homely but lives on the fact that princess diana came to eat there (maybe once who knows) and her memorabilia are all over the place. I ordered one of the specialities - the spaghetti with clams - and although the pasta was cooked very well, the sauce that came with it was super salty and pretty much just tasted like salty tomato. Portions were also quite small compared to other Italian places I've been to but it was still enough to fill me up. Come for a taste of Italian mama food.",

The restaurant itself has seen better days, tatty furnitures, pealing paint on some walls, and tacky collections of Italian souvenirs complete the decor. The service was alright but nothing to remember. Food was subpar for one 'of the best' Italian. All the 'specials' were actually on the regular menu, our starter choice of the impossible to screw 'caprese salad/ fantasia du buffala alla caprese' with Mozzarella flown directly from Naples was a complete let down, tasteless tomatoes and chewy Mozzarella... for the main a Spaghetti Vongole, with peproncini (not on the menu description), tomato. Sauce and plenty of oil, I mean pleeenty.. was mostly good because the clams were fresh tasting but otherwise won't leave an undying impression.With all that, we exited the tourist-trap quickly, avoiding the dessert menuThe only real good part came in the form of a Glass of red wine, mostly because it was the size of a fish bowl and made the rest of the dinner bearable.

We met there as a group (two groups, actually) ahead of the John Williams concert. The service was friendly, if not terribly efficient - the food can be considered solid neighbourhood Italian. The pizzas and pasta aren't spectacular, but freshly made - though at downtown London prices of course (UKP 11 for a standard pizza). I myself had the sepia and shrimp mixed salad, also at UKP 11 - and it was okay, but not better than okay. The atmosphere is nice, if very busy. Solid option near RAH.",

We ordered the cured meat platter, gnocchi, two seafood pasta dishes, and the spinach and ricotta ravioli. Shortly after our meat platter appetizer was cleared and our waiter came over with the desert menu. 5 minutes later, the waiter came back and asked what we would like. I jokingly say \"our dinner\". \u00a0The waiter smiled then walked away upset. \u00a0He came back and explained that the person who clears the table must check on the main courses. \u00a0(Honestly, it was no big deal.) He went on to talk about his coworker who didn't know what he's doing. \u00a0As soon as he walked away another waiter came over and commented on our food and waiter not being right. Super uncomfortable.",

First off, it's extremely busy. We were here for dinner and waited outside in the cold (Christmas time) for about 15 minutes. No complaints. It was worth the frost bite my fingers endured.We were seated downstairs, which is a bit unsettling, when you think of the amount of people downstairs and only one way in or out. My mind tends to deviate to worse case scenarios. They do have options for street-level seating, but seating is limited. The pizza was delicious and the pasta was amazing. I'd come back to London for this place alone.",

All we could taste and smell were the cleaning chemicals. They tried taking away half full glasses of wine. After charging our credit cards, they literally threw our cards and receipts onto the table. While we were waiting for our cars outside, they brought out a large container of greasy liquid and dumped it into the storm drain next to us. I've experienced bad service before, but I've never left a bad review. Thank you Da Mario for being my first.",

If you live or visit London (or willing to) and like to taste great food, you must go to this restaurant. Service is very italian which means that it comes with its pitfalls.",

    "text": "I heard the hype that Lady Di used to bring the boys here to slum it and eat pizza. Actually, it was really great! The upstairs is small and cramped but it buzzes with charm and seems really popular. The staff are super friendly and the food is excellent. It has the quaint charm that I was hoping for in place of the cheese factor of knowing about the mystique of the place. The downstairs is a bit odd, in the that upstairs you expect nouveau riche slumming it for pizza and fine wine in a cozy restaurant, while the basement looks like a Latvian club. Advice: eat upstairs, piss downstairs.",
