    "text": "After years of talking about this restaurant, I finally got to try it out, and boy what an experience it was!! On arrival we were greeted by the very friendly and helpful staff who advised us how the night would proceed and invited us to order a pre-dinner cocktail from the bar. The selection was good although a little pricey - I went for an apple and blackberry mojito that was delicious.We were then introduced to our blind waiter, Asha, who would be taking us through to our seats and looking after us for the evening. He explained that we just needed to shout his name if we needed anything during the course of the evening, and then led us through the curtain in a line, each person with our hand on the shoulder of the person in front.We were seated at a long table with other diners and brought a bottle of \"surprise wine\" which I was instructed to pour - quite a nerve wracking experience as I certainly didn't want to waste wine! We had chosen the white menu which is the surprise chefs selection so we really didn't know what we were getting. The starter definitely smelt like fish when it was put down in front of us, and we all settled on smoked trout on toast. It was pretty hard to eat with cutlery, and having chewed on an empty fork an number of times, I gave up and used my fingers! the main course came, again I could smell fish but thought I could taste fish, chicken and beef, plus sides of mushroom, parsnip and some kind pickled onion! This course was slightly easier to eat with the knife and fork, a good job as it also had some kind of sauce which would have been pretty messy should I have been required to eat with my hands. Dessert was next, some sort of custard pudding or pannacota?? We also had a surprise cocktail which was definitely a pina colada.Having read previous reviews, I wasn't expecting the food to be particularly good but I was pleasantly surprised. I do believe that you get much of your enjoyment of food from the look and presentation so it was strange to remove this aspect. I really was a peculiar experience having a meal in the pitch black, and I found I was leaning forward a lot to get closer to other people as well as my plate! It was definitely a little unnerving when the conversation stopped, but we all found ourselves joining in with our fellow dinners conversations which I'm pretty sure wouldn't have happened in the light!Once we had finished our meal, Asha escorted us out, I was surprised by how much I had lost my bearings. My only complaint was that it seemed to be over much too quickly, I would have liked to spend a little longer in there enjoying the experience.I felt quite dazed as we came back into the light, and a little tipsy, may be my wine glass had been a little fuller than I had thought! I was cleaner than I had thought, no food smeared around my face! Now to find out what we had eaten - just how good is my palate?? Well, apparently its pretty rubbish! The smoked trout turned out to be foie gras and duck breast terrine - what, two different things??? The main course was shark, crocodile and ox cheek with tongue - not the easiest of things to guess but I pride myself that I was kind of on the right lines...And pudding was some kind of pear dish which I didn't get at all.Overall, a fantastic experience with good food and drink. Yes, its fairly expensive, but not something you would do every day.Now, to work on my palate....",

    "text": "Here is a crazy idea. Ever tried eating a three course meal in pitch black darkness? Well if you think this sounds like fun you need to try out Dans le Noir restaurant in Farringdon.On entering you take a seat in the lobby and decide whether to eat the surprise three course menu of where there is no description of what you will have. Or you can choose your meal. I definitely recommend the surprise menu. You are introduced to your blind waiter. They explained that all the waiters are blind as their senses are more attuned to working in darkness. You are instructed to place your right hand on their shoulder and then they lead you into the darkest room I have ever been in.You are seated, then after explaining that if you call your waiters name they will come, they pour your first glass of wine and depart.The first ten minutes were difficult as the darkness is so oppressive. There literally is not a single shard of light. You can hear others in the restaurant and this I found comforting. My partner and I often held hands as a comfort to.As the food arrived things got really interesting. It is startling to realise how much you use your eyes when you eat. Without this sense your taste is really heightened, and it is great testing your knowledge on flavours.When the main arrived using a knife and fork initially was a problem, but before you know it you are chomping away as normal. Without a single hiccup or broken glass we made it to the end of our meal. At around \u00a350 per head it was an amazing experience.",

    "text": "The Idea behind this place is that without the use of sight, guests are forced to place more attention to their taste buds.and that works.kindda.when i walked into the pitch black dining room, and realized just how dark pitch black is, my stomach dropped, and adrenaline went coursing through my entire body. Omg, I thought, what the hell have I gotten myself into, this was a mistake, I'm going to trip and fall and die or some other terrible accident and no one will ever know. The state of panic my body launched itself into was astounding. My eyes literally hurt trying to find some kind of light to focus on, as if by looking *really* hard, I could force light out of the darkness. Eventually your eyes, well, adjust is the wrong word, but they reach a kind of half closed state, where you cant tell if they're open or closed and frankly it doesn't matter anymore. The food was good. Not mind blowing, but that's a bit hard, when a large portion of your brain is not only trying to figure out *what* the hell you're eating, but *where* the hell it is as well. after quite a bit of scraping, coming up with empty forks, and eventually putting your finger tips down to find your food, you get the hang of it, more or less. Funny thing about taking one sense away to enhance another - \u00a0sometimes its not the sense you would expect. My partner and I kept our voices low, neutral, as we would in any restaurant, but many of the diners around us doubled their volume to make up for the loss of sight. Just because you cant see the room full of people around you, doesn't mean their not there. After you eat they take you back into the reception area and ask what you think you had. We described everything that we had figured out, and they did a little show and tell, with pictures and descriptions. Here is where the main flaw of the place was brought into light: they tried to do too much. The starter was complex, but interesting and while certain ingredients were surprising, you felt you had a grasp on it. The mains, however they had 3 very different dishes and set ups, but all on one plate. They called it ''tasting menu style.'' That's all well and good when you know and can consciously eat each one individually, however when you're blindly \u00a0mashing your food together and are happy enough with yourself to recognize that you just ate steak with mash, you're not going to assume and go looking for soy and honey glazed duck with spinach (which I swear wasn't there) and seared calves liver with artichoke puree. It might have all worked by themselves, but not as invisible mush. \u00a0It's a cool, querky, novelty place to go with some friends for something different. - in fact, I would say everyone should go once and see what its like, \u00a0but I'm not rushing to book another table anytime soon",

    "text": "This is best described as a novelty experience rather than a culinary delight. You're led into a pitch black environment, completely devoid of sight, and guided to your table. You are consequently rooted in your chair for several hours whilst the food and drink is served, and then led back out into the light, blinking, when the ordeal is finally over.The food was absolutely vile, and my stomach is still doing somersaults on the morning after the night before. Our party had a tuna and swordfish sashimi for starters, then a medley of crocodile, bison and springbok for the main, and a raspberry mouse for dessert. The wine was, well, slightly more palatable than vinegar.Also, having a conversation is deafening. Without the typical visual cues of body language and facial expressions, you're reduced to shouting across the room in the general direction of where you think your companions are seated. I had to steal other people's drinks under cover of darkness to maintain my composure.On the plus side, the serving staff were excellent. They were courteous, efficient, and entirely professional, never more so than when I pleaded to be taken out of the room so I could go for a pee. Meanwhile, upstairs in the (lighted) cocktail bar, the barman mixes drinks with painstaking attention to detail, and if I was in the mood to leave a tip he'd have received the lion's share.",

You will find yourself eating some rather bizarre flavour combinations but the most important thing is that you will be eating in complete darkness. You will never have experienced darkeness like this before it is so dark that your eyes hurt! Very interesting night out and gives you some perspective as to what it would be like to be a blind person (I was so impressed by our blind waiter). However I think it is a one off experience.",

    "text": "After overhearing a conversation in an elevator once about how amazing this restaurant was I have been wanting to try it ever since. The first thought that springs to mind is but how the hell can you eat in the dark? So I finally got to try it last night and see or not see as it were for myself. I sampled one of the cocktails first in the lit bar, i tried the Dans le Noir (\u00a38.50) which was raspberry puree, vodka, Chambord, splash orange juice topped up with Laurent Perrier Brut with a blackberry on top. As me and my friend waited for the 9 o clock sitting the bar got busier and the people from the previous sitting poured out of the hall rubbing their eyes, some laughing, some looking very confused. At 9 we were introduced to our blind waiter Mona who told us to form a line and to place our hand on the shoulder of the person in front of us as she led us down the dimly lit hall, through two sets of curtains into complete darkness. We both ordered the white surprise menu and we were handed a plate of what we thought was just meat at first but as we explored the plate further we found some rice and veg. It was difficult to cut the food and it was a little cold which was disappointing.The dessert was a blueberry mouse and vanilla custard (there is probably some fancy name for it but thats what it was basically) I enjoyed it, but i was expecting more for the price at \u00a329 per person. But It was a great experience that i am glad to have tried.",

    "text": "Darkness seemed to be the theme of my day yesterday. London was experiencing one of its normal grey rainy days. Then i went inside Miroslaw Balka's \"How it is\" (telegraph.co.uk/culture/\u2026) during an evening at the Tate Modern, and i ended the day with dinner at Dans Le Noir.I had reserved a place last week itself. But when i called to confirm the time, i was told that there was no booking in my name. They reserved again. Sloppy book-keeping ... they lose one star for this.After this the experience was unique ... the spookiest meal i have ever had. Our blind waiter led me and another couple, each holding on to the person in front, into the inky black darkness of the dining room. I was slow and apprehensive ... and often felt my hold slipping ... but i desperately held on. But the journey didn't take long (thankfully there were no stairs) and somehow we managed to sit at the aisle side of what seemed like a long table.I felt for the glasses and the cutlery and waited. The first item to arrive was the surprise cocktail. It was nice, but very sweet. I guessed some concoction made of vodka and cranberry juice.Then it was time for the starter. One can choose from the Meat, Vegetarian, Surprise or the Fish menus ... i had gone for the surprise. My surprise seemed like a salad and turkey with a a sprinkling of nuts. I had bravely started using the fork, but gave up soon after. Your hands are your best bet here ... it allows you to scrape the plate to search for any left-overs :)I was confused by the mains. I tasted fish but the lady in front of me who also had ordered the surprise menu thought it was lamb. I tasted lamb later. So was there some fish ? I didn't know. But surely there was some potato mash and vegetables. Actually i was almost sure it was a British sunday roast. Again i scraped the plate and finished all morsels of meat until there was only some mash left.The interesting thing was, the darkness didn't subside. Even after 1.5 hours inside, i still couldn't make out a thing ... not even my fingers. The room was darker than any other darkness i had ever experienced. I can't even begin to guess how they managed to accomplish this.Once the meal was over i was told what i had eaten. My guesses weren't correct of course ... but i was somewhat close.This is a very difficult rating to assign. Do i recommend the experience ? Certainly, no questions. Will i come back ? If i am accompanying someone, then sure ... else i don't think so. The food was good but not great, and the unique experience is not attractive enough for a second visit. So its a 3.5 star in my mind.The food is costly ... the 2 course menu plus the cocktail set me back by \u00a347.50. But the money is well spent for what will almost certainly be \u00a0one of the most memorable meals you will have ever had.",

    "text": "Well, this was certainly a unique experience. I took my girlfriend there as a treat after reading about it, and I must say it lived up to expectation. When we arrived we were given an introduction to the restaurant, told all about the dining in the dark experience and invited to wait in the bar until they were ready (about 15-20 mins). We visited the little bar upstairs which was very tasteful, the drinks weren't cheap in general but the mystery cocktails they do for around \u00a38 are recommended! Here they took our order and were very accomodating here, my girlfriend isn't able to eat some meat/dairy, which they took into account. After a short while we were told that our table was ready, and taken to the entrance to the dining area where we were introduced to our waiter. We were led to our table with some other people, making a train of people by holding onto the person in front. Once we were in and sat down, I was rather surprised to find the other couple sitting right next to us on the same table, I couldn't tell how far they were away as it really is pitch black in there, your eyes don't adjust to it so you can see, which is a very strange and can be worrying at first! We were joined by another couple slightly into the meal as well, this was odd but the people we were next to were lovely and meeting them outside was interesting as we had no idea what they looked like! The food we had was very nice, I remember having some venison, foie gras and ostrich, so you have to be prepared for some interesting flavours and textures, I think the sensory depravation does make you appreciate the food more. It can get very loud in the restaurant as people compensate for the dark by speaking louder, the waiters did ask everyone to quieten down a few times which was appreciated. We had a great time here, it was a bit pricey (\u00a3120 for 2 of us) but it was an experience I'll never forget, I wouldn't recommend it if you think you might be uncomfortable with the darkness though, as the only way out is to leave!",

    "text": "Dans Le Noir is unique. I can promise you that you've never had a dining experience like it! Dans Le Noir (In the Dark) is a restaurant where you literally dine in the pitch black. When you get there you can have a drink at the bar although it's pretty pricey- \u00a37 for a vodka and diet coke! When your table is ready your waiter/waitress will come out and be introduced to you. Now, this is where it gets interesting: all the waiting staff are blind. You are then asked to hold on to each other's shoulders as you led into the dining area. It is such a bizarre experience walking into the pitch black like that and, for me, I found it a bit uncomfortable. From then on your waiter is your guide, telling you where the glasses and cutlery are on the table and seating you. Now, there is no set menu. You can specify whether you want meat, fish or a vegetarian option, but other than that there could be anything on your plate. To start I had lamb with gravy, roast potatoes and cabbage, and I ate it all with my fingers! I just couldn't grasp the concept of using a knife and fork in the dark, but I'm sure that it was just me being an idiot. I managed to use a spoon for the dessert :) I have to say that I'm not sure if I'd go to Dans Le Noir. The food was reasonably priced- \u00a330 for two courses and \u00a340 for three-and the staff were absolutely fantastic, but now that I've been there and done it it doesn't have the novelty value that it did before! However I really would recommend it as something completely different and something you're not going to find anywhere else in London! Also, it really gives an insight into the way that blind people live their lives and they do donate a lot of money to the RNIB. Oh yes, and if you need the toilet then go before the meal! The staff will take you out but they say it ruins the experience. So overall it's a thumbs up for Dans Le Noir!",

    "text": "I'd heard about Dans Le Noir and had wanted to go for a while so was really excited when my friend organised a big girly dinner there. For those that don't know (French) the premise is you eat dinner in the dark! You choose a menu option before hand from meat, fish, vege and can also let it know about special dietary requirements. All the waiters in the restaurant are blind which in itself is amazing to a fully sighted person. The time slots are pretty strict but you get plenty of time to eat dinner. After meeting in the reception you're led into the restaurant in a long conga line by the blind waiter. The order you go in will depend on what menu you have so they know where you're sitting. They direct you to your seats and let you know where the wine, bread etc is. It's one of the weirdest most interesting experiences I've ever had. You really are in absolute pitch darkness. We soon gave up eating with knives and fork and opted for fingers because it was so much easier! I was the only vege in the group so I missed out comparing and trying to figure out what we were eating. When you come out they show you a menu of what you had. I would definitely recommend going in a group of more than two as it's more fun. Not being able to see is surprisingly tiring. It was a real effort to listen to waht everyone was saying especially as we were in a big group. It's amazing ow much you rely on sight cues! Prices are very reasonable and the actu food was very good but not amazing. We paid about \u00a320 for two courses. All in all an experience I would highly recommend!",

After choosing our meal (there are 3 set menus to choose from, Red: Meat or chicken, Green : Vegetrian and blus: seafood) we were giuded by our blind waiter to the dining room which was piched dark after going through 3 sets of curtains. Inside there, we felt like we were the blind ones and the waiter is the one who could see! when the food arrived, forks and knives jumped out of the window and we started eating with our own hands! we shared the tab;e with another couple which we didn't meet before hand and the conversation started to get casual so quickly that you wouldn't do in a lit restaurant. The food was great, but, we didn't waht we were eating. You have got to rely on the feel of the pieces and the texture with taste to guess what it is. after the meal, they will ask you to guess what you have eaten and then they show you the menu, and what a suprise!! What we thought was potato chips, truned out to be celeriac chips! Price wise, it was \u00a379.00 for both of us. It is a must visit place, like the pyramids, at least once in your life time!",

You walk into the bar area and are handed a menu with the option of either a complete surprise, a surpise without fish or vegetarian option. This delightful experience is not for the fussy eater as you have no idea what you are about to eat. Then a blind waiter (yes you read that correctly) greets you and holds the first person's hand and a small group of unsuspecting diners hold each other's shoulders nervously like a train and are led into the pitch black dining area. You really can't see your hand in front of you. How many times can you honestly say in a lifetime that you are at the completely mercy of a blind person? I have always admired people with a sight disability but gaining a tiny idea of what it's really like, I have nothing but admiration for these guys. And the waiters are incredible; funny, happy and incredible service. No-one was injured, stabbed with cutlery or any other mishap. I would advise eating with your hands to really gain full benefit of this experience and pouring your drinks is amusing. I can honestly say I didn't want to leave at the end of the meal. Oh and the fun part, eating your food and trying to guess what it is. It's incredible just how wrong you can be, even though your other sense are heightened. You are then led back out into the lit bar area and presented with a menu of what you ate. My boyfriend was shocked to read that he had venison and ostrich and I was given lamb and duck. The menu changes all the time, so there's no cheating if you plump for another visit. It is a little pricey but well worth it for a memorable, lifetime experience.",

    "text": "An intriguing, daunting and overwhelming experience but also humorous due to many mishaps in the dark. Other reviewers have already outlined the concept and process. The smells are overwhelming as is the noise. Our waiter Addy told us people tend to speak louder in the dark. As for the food, it was hard to tell other than sticking your hands in the plate whether you had eaten everything. Small portions, mysterious food and textures - often tastes that don't normally go together (I had wild boar, calf liver and saffron rice with crayfish all together as the main). Slightly daunting that you will never know the state of your plates or cutlery or food.Very disappointing that no matter which menu you choose, everyone has the same dessert. It seems like a bit of an anti-climax after the excitement of trying to describe your unique dishes to each other and offering them to your friends in the dark.Slightly overpriced for the quality and amount of food, but ultimately it's the experience that you are paying for.On the plus side, loved sharing a long table (I think it was long) with strangers in the dark. The overlap of conversations is just hilarious. Don't expect to have privacy because it's dark in there!",

    "text": "This is an amazing experience. I've been intrigued for ages and so glad we finally went. You sit in complete, pitch darkness, your waiter is blind and you don't know what you're being served (you pick a menu at the beginning out of 'surprise', meat, fish and vegetarian) and advise them of anything you can't/don't eat. It's such a surreal experience but the food is amazing, our waiter (Darren) was a legend, and we ended up having a great time with the two girls we were sat next to (who we'd never met and couldn't see). Being in the dark changes your whole perception of the world, friends flavours and all. It may sound odd but give it a go!",

In a complete darkness.A meal at Dans Le Noir will not only test your senses, but tolerance. One is left to guess the dishes after the meal. I was pleasantly surprised by the range of food: from foie gras pate to exotic meat, although, I was expecting much more from the quality of cooking.It's definitely not an experience for everyone, but rather something quite different that will give you food for thought. Eating in complete darkness will definitely open up your senses... or will make you anxious.The restaurant is located about 10-minute walk away from Chancery Lane and Barbican tube stations. Although the reception room could do with a bit of a make-up, the service was great. Slightly expensive, but worth a try at least once.Would visit again? Maybe.My score: 5/10 estonianfoodie.com",

    "text": "Went here for a birthday dinner-- they sing but sadly no candles-- and it was such an interesting experience. You walk into a dimly lit restaurant and are told to put anything that is a light source (watches, phones, etc.) and your purses/coats into a locker room. You then are greeted by the maitre'd and given a choice of menus-- Surprise, Meat, Vegetarian, or Fish. The \"Surprise\" one is kind of a misnomer because all of them are surprises really-- you have no idea what your plates are going to look like. You are greeted by a waiter who leads you into a completely and utterly dark room (hand on his shoulder) and as you sit down at a sort of community table to start enjoying your meal. This is sort of a make or break point for me-- I ended up having a really friendly and interesting table with lots of good conversation, but I can see how it could end up the other way around. The food was delicious, albeit hard to eat (lots of disappointment when your fork reaches your mouth and you haven't gotten any food on it). I will say that make sure you are ready for an experience because you have no say over what you are eating (unless it is an allergy and you submit that at the time of reservation). At the end of the meal you are lead out to pay with the maitre'd and you are given a \"look book\" of sorts to see what your meal looked like. I ate kangaroo and I liked it! Overall a great experience for the adventurous and the food was delicious prepared. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "The concept of this restaurant has appealed to me ever since it was first brought to my attention so I finally got around to seeing if it lived up to my expectation.Upon arrival we were greeted and briefed on what to expect. I picked the white menu, which is the chef's surprise and we opted for 3 courses with surprise wines. Our coordinateur then advised us to use the toilets prior to entering the dark room.Given that the toilet area was to provide my first impression I was a little taken aback by the state it was in. It was smelly and grubby, reminiscent of something you would find in a divey run down pub. Even the stairs and carpet outside were worn and tatty. Not what I was expecting!We returned to the lobby and deposited our stuff in one of the provided lockers before being introduced to our blind waiter, Roberto. We were then led through expertly into the dark room and seated.It really is pitch black, and I found myself exploring my surroundings with my hands to try and build up an idea of the environment around me despite the inky blackness.The food arrived promptly, with the accompanying wine in tumblers rather than wine glasses for obvious reasons! Eating in the dark was surprisingly difficult, the lack of any tactile feedback from the cutlery makes it impossible to tell if you stabbing at food, your plate or just thin air! For both my starter and my main I had to resort to running my fingers across the plate to determine if I had eaten everything or not.The three courses arrived in what seemed like quick succession. However we weren't rushed and once we had finished Roberto told us to give him a call when we were ready to leave and was happy for us to take our time.Once we were ready to go we were led back through the curtains and back to the lobby area where our coordinateur presented us with a leather bound booklet showing us what we had eaten. My guesses proved to be mostly incorrect, however the dishes selected were exotic enough that I wouldn't have known what they were even if they had been served up to me in broad daylight...Overall I found it to be an immersive dining experience which I would definitely recommend to others to try, however I didn't find the food to be remarkable enough to feel that I would want to return. Our bill for 2 covers totalled \u00a3144 and while I don't regret it for the overall package I have had better food for less money elsewhere.",

Got there a little early and was slow to be seated (didn't end up at the table until 8). In the meanwhile, the maitre-de took my order (I chose the red meat meal, between vegetarian, seafood, and chef's choice).I ended up heading to my table with a very nice couple. We formed a train (holding each other's shoulders), as we were guided through utter darkness to our table. It felt a bit disorienting and stressful at first, but I quickly became more comfortable as I made friends with the folks sitting next to me.Three courses, two new friends, and a mystery cocktail later I was quite satisfied. Our waiter Jack was wonderful -- hilarious and always there to help when we needed him. At the end they showed us pictures of our meal. What a shocker! I won't divulge what I ate in case of spoilers, but I would not recommend ordering the meat entry unless you feel adventures. I don't know when I'll next be ready to go back. The price was steep (\u00a361 + service), but totally worth it for the experience. Would definitely recommend - and kudo's to Jack for some of the best customer service I've ever had. What an experience!",

Once back in comfort of sight, they'll have you guess, and then show you a pictured menu of what you ate, which I thought was rather fun.--If you do the White course (Chef's surprise), be prepared for VERY exotic food. \u00a0If you are not comfortable with that, stick with the Red (meat) or Blue (seafood). \u00a0SPOILER ALERT: \u00a0I got the White course and my meal ended up containing ostrich, shark, and....zebra :X. \u00a0I'm still not sure how i feel about the last one, but i know a friend of mine is a wildlife lover and had some trouble sleeping that night...",

However, this was certainly my experience upon leaving such a fascinating concept restaurant, which surpassed my already high expectations. First off, my date and I were led to a series of lockers where were asked to leave our belongings and venture into the darkness. We both opted for the 'not-for vegetarians' surprise menu. Later when quizzed on what we ate, I said veal, the waitress said ostrich...I said chutney, she said goat's cheese. But you know what, the experience itself was so utterly delicious the food really wasn't the main attraction ;-) Ben our blind waiter was perfectly attentive, as two tumblers of white and red wine were delivered with a deft tap of the shoulder. The only question you need to ask yourself is...should I scoop the mash with my hands, or opt for an ever-vanishing fork? My date and I differed on this approach, with rather enchanting conclusions...pitch black has never been so illuminating!",

    "text": "On a trip to London 3 years back this was on my lists of \"Must do!\". First and foremost, please make sure you make a reservation and arrive on time! I was nearly late thanks to jet lag and a very long transport from Oxford Street but anyway. They themselves state if their staff who are visually impaired can show up to work, you can show up to a dinner reservation. Really gets you doesn't it?I thought I would be dining alone in the dark which sounds quite pathetic but luckily, they seated me at a table with literal group of strangers as all I heard were voices and slight Italian accents from a man named Fernando at my table. The good thing is they ask you up front what you will not eat or are allergic to. I for example do not eat pork. The early cocktails outside the dark room helped and it was nice to have dinner with others without being distracted by faces or cell phones. VERY STRICT no cell phone policy but don't worry, they provide lockers. By the end of the night my taste buds were so excited with everything except the dessert which was a predictable chocolate flour-less cake but the other entrees were superb. Once I received my very high bill (the most expensive single dinner I have ever had, nearly \u00a380) if I recall and for a girl from the U.S., that was quite a surprise but worth it! My main course that night? Crocodile curry and it was delicious!",

The first thought that springs to mind is but how the hell can you eat in the dark? So I finally got to try it last night and see or not see as it were for myself.I sampled one of the cocktails first in the lit bar, i tried the Dans le Noir (\u00c2\u00a38.50) which was raspberry puree, vodka, Chambord, splash orange juice topped up with Laurent Perrier Brut with a blackberry on top. As me and my friend waited for the 9 o clock sitting the bar got busier and the people from the previous sitting poured out of the hall rubbing their eyes, some laughing, some looking very confused.At 9 we were introduced to our blind waiter Mona who told us to form a line and to place our hand on the shoulder of the person in front of us as she led us down the dimly lit hall, through two sets of curtains into complete darkness.We both ordered the white surprise menu and we were handed a plate of what we thought was just meat at first but as we explored the plate further we found some rice and veg. It was difficult to cut the food and it was a little cold which was disappointing.The dessert was a blueberry mouse and vanilla custard (there is probably some fancy name for it but that's what it was basically) I enjoyed it, but i was expecting more for the price at \u00c2\u00a329 per person. But It was a great experience that i am glad to have tried.",

    "text": "Ok, so here's how my experience started...I arrived with a full bladder, searching madly for the nearest bathroom. With trepidation I followed the concierge's hand signals towards an envelope of shrouded darkness. Luckily I popped out in a passageway with complete with lights....whew....unluckily, once I had found the bathroom, it appeared the bathroom's light bulb was out (this was not part of the setup, I considered it for a moment, but knew it wouldn't work, no one wants to clean up after that, and confirmed it later in the evening upon returning to a then well lit bathroom). Anyway, as I said, I needed to go, pronto...so I made a calculated guess of where everything was from the doorway, before plunging headlong into the blackness as the door closed behind me and all light was emphatically extinguished....It all worked out OK (I think...I couldn't really tell too much, but I even managed to find the soap and wash my hands!). This was just my first 5 minutes at the place, and already I was enticed by the sheer feeling of helplessness one experiences in the dark, even though you can usually get by just fine if you put your mind to it and take certain precautions!Right, on to the \"advertised\" experience. So we went in as a large group, 1 hand on the shoulder of the person in front, don't let go, or you'll be left behind enemy lines and never find your way out. Lost forever in the inky darkness. Possibly waking up in a bath full of ice...no, let me stop there... Luckily, I managed to hold on to my guide....Unluckily I walked straight into a wall! If you could imagine someone mashing their face up against a pane of glass, then you'd have a pretty good idea of how I looked, except it's funnier when it's glass, not a wall, people are watching from the other side, and it was your intention to do this for other's amusement. Luckily, no one saw it happen, as it was completely dark. Unluckily, everyone heard me grunt at the point of impact....After sitting down the real experience started, we had a sample of wine and tapas. It was an awesome experience trying to figure out what you were eating, how much was actually on your plate (there were numerous Eureka! moments when people found they had one more of their favourite morsels left on their plate that they hadn't noticed), and how to tackle your food with a knife and fork. Obviously the knife and fork was just foreplay, and could only be tolerated as long as your will power allowed, soon being sidelined in favour of the more direct and hedonistic strategy of digging in with your hands. It was truly a experience of discovery and excitement. Everything was unexpected, even Matt taking off his shirt unbeknownst to most...Conversation was enthralling as once everyone was finished eating, their was literally nothing else to distract people, you were either speaking or listening (or perhaps making out, I'm not sure if any of that went down...but it could have...).The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars, is because I wouldn't say the food was earth shattering, and I can't give them 5 stars unless the experience was perfect. The food was definitely good value for what we paid, but we only had the tapas. Without any shadow of a doubt I will be returning to sample their 3 course menu, and will then update this review with my more qualified thoughts on their culinary expertise. All in all the experience is definitely a \"must try\" in my book...except for those afraid of the dark...",

Right hand on the shoulder in front, as per our blind waiter Thomas' instructions, we were led into the pitch dark. The blind leading the (temporarily) blind. With my hand placed on the back of my chair, I fumbled around to find the seat and avoid the early embarrassment of sitting on the floor. Thomas nimbly assisted us in helping us locate our glasses and cutlery. It took us significantly longer to figure out where we all were in relation to one another. It seemed incredibly noisy and very difficult to hear each other to begin with. Without being able to see each other's faces and expressions we had to lean in and concentrate on the words and tone. Social etiquette can easily be left at the door here.eat with your mouth open, yawn widely, scratch.who cares?!  I had been coerced into going for the 3-course Chef's surprise white menu (\u00a344 each) with a surprise white wine. This translates into anything goes. Eek. The drinks arrived together with instructions on how to pour. An immediate spillage of water ensued. Food next. Figuring out how to use cutlery, how not to lose the cutlery, what the food is and where the food actually is on the plate is all part of the fun. Table manners go out the window and it's a sauce-spilling, dressing-dripping, finger-food extravaganza. You don't go here for the gourmet cuisine. The starter was not quite the plain, meaty fish & salad we thought, but lobster, leeks and rocket salad. Plus caviar on the edge of the plate, which we all missed! The main seemed simpler - beef, pork, crackling, roast spuds, some kind of fish sauce and citrus dressing. Surf & Turf perhaps?Oh no. zebra, kangaroo, crispy Parma ham, roast potatoes and anchovies! Good grief. * feels guilty * The dessert, the nicest of the courses was a lemon mousse (err, posset) with an ice cream filled chocolate, shortbread and figs (not peaches at all). Best story of the evening? Apparently Wills & Kate went there one evening, via a side entrance, and dined in perfect anonymity! You can't fault this place for the experience. It's humbling to realise how sighted people take their vision for granted. It was an incredible, one-time experience. And challenging too. Well, aside from the wine pouring. Turns out I can do that with my eyes closed after all.",

You're in such a high state of anticipation that it woulddn't be hard to be blown away and they failed entirely. Similarly, the \"bar\"/anteroom was empty when we arrived at seven and is not at all atmospheric or pleasant - you're better off drinking at the pub next door.In the end, this is something you'll want to try once but it's a shame about the food.",

By the end of the dinner you realise how hard it is not to have eyesight, although it is just for a dinner and you're not even moving from the spot. And the dishes themselves were very delicious as well. Considering you're paying for the dinner and the experience, it is a very good quality-price ratio.I don't want to give much detail about the food besides that it's good. Frankly, I believe the main thing one remembers will be the experience anyway. It was still great fun guessing what you're actually eating.",

    "text": "I've known about Dans Le Noir? from very early on in my years in London, mostly because I had seen it on lists of places where Will & Kate have dined. But after a friend went late last year and described the experience, I resolved to book in a visit and recruited some adventurous foodie friends to join me. When you get there, you stow your jacket and bags in a locker, then order from a mystery menu: all you have to do is choose the number of courses, whether you want seafood, meat, vegetarian / vegan, or total mystery, and the wine (which can either be a la carte, or also mystery). Most of the table went for the 3-course white mystery menu and we also ordered a mystery bottle of wine. We were then led into the dining room, single file with a hand on the shoulder of the person in front of you. Since we were a group of 5, we were seated at a shared table, whereas I think smaller groups have individual tables. The adventure began with pouring our own wine and water. Thankfully the bottles of wine were screw cap, and the wine glass was stemless and slightly shorter than the water glass, so we just about managed without too much mishap. The hardest part was knowing how much liquid had already gone in the glass! The food arrived quite quickly, and we turned out to be pretty good at guessing, identifying the starter as smoked salmon and crab. The main was a little more tricky, as they served it on a plate divided into three sections. One part had what we thought was beef (later turned out to be veal) cut into chunks, although some were a little too big, and the meat was very tough. Then there was a fish and potato dish, that I didn't quite understand how it went with the veal, and then some peas and plum side dish in the last section. That course was a bit confusing. But the dessert was very good, with a chocolate and passion fruit panna cotta. One of my friends even accurately guessed that the first bottle of wine was a riesling and that the second was a pinot noir! I thought time would feel like an eternity in the darkness, but it actually went by quite quickly, and we managed to get through it without too much mishap. Around us, we heard the sound of dropped plates at least twice, but everyone takes it in stride. At the end of the meal, you get to see pictures of what the dishes look like, and there is a bar to hang out in with silent disco headphones if you would like to linger further (in the light). All in all, I would definitely recommend this experience: the food is not bad, but it's all about the experience, and with that they've nailed it. It's the right level of uncomfortable but totally doable for those that are up for an adventure!",

This food was yummy, but it wasn't much different than going to any other restaurant in town, except it was pitch black. The server was great, and I love that the song staff is blind people. This gives them a chance to utilize their skills. The food was good, the cocktails delicious, and the staff was great. This was pretty good, but nothing near as interesting as I had hoped for. I won't tell my friends that it is a must do.",

    "text": "An extraordinary experience that was equal parts unnerving, exciting & enlightening, my dinner at Dans Le Noir was a very special part of my recent trip to London. \u00a0I suppose like many, I first learned of this restaurant after seeing it in the film About Time.Though I'm a pathetic loser who travels & dines alone, I was made to feel welcome by their staff & while I'd already familiarized myself with the process, they explained everything about what was in store for the evening as I placed my jacket, watch, phone & other things safely in a locker. \u00a0After selecting my desired menu option (choices vary in the number of courses), I ordered drinks & met my blind server, Fabio.I placed my right arm on his shoulder & was then led into darkness. \u00a0I spend a lot of time in the dark, so I'm fairly well acclimated to it, but Fabio & the other staff live their entire lives in it. \u00a0More than a culinary experience, an evening at Dans Le Noir is a lesson learned. \u00a0While you struggle to reach for your beverage, clean your plate or focus your hearing so that you can hear the conversations you wish to over the din of the crowded dining area, your senses are being forced to quickly adapt to this sudden change & it can be unsettling.Service was surprisingly quick, so I didn't even really have time to ponder things like how much they must save on decorations.But of course the main draw for many is the excitement of what they may be eating, which is not revealed to you until after you've finished your meal. While I would likely have never eaten a number of those things in the light of day, in the blackness of Dans Le Noir, it was quite different, as I cleaned each of my plates. \u00a0They offer a range of specialty cocktails, including non-alcoholic options & the experience is really something that should be enjoyed & savored, even if you don't leave with Rachel McAdams.",

    "text": "Pros - Took my fianc\u00e9 here for his birthday, his first time, my second time (first time was in Montreal) We're visiting from LA, thought this would be a great occasion for him to try out this whole \"dining in the dark\" experience. The experience overall was okay. The food was good we both got 3 courses (white option). Our waiter (Fabio) did a decent job accommodating our needs, etc. Seems like he was waiting all the tables in the area, because all we hear throughout our meal was random people calling for him. Cons-BUT, here's the downside of this restaurant. They're really shady when it comes to drinks, even water. I asked for water and Fabio brought out a glass-sealed bottle. I immediately knew this will end up on our bill in the end so I didn't even bother opening it. Instead, I asked Fabio for tap-water. He seems a bit surprised that I found out, even in complete darkness. I understand some people might prefer still/sparkling water, but you should at least have the common decency to let the customers know beforehand that there are options. Shouldn't just hand them the bottle and have them unknowing fall for it's trap. Luckily I didn't, nice try though. Shame on you guys for even doing this trick on people knowing they can't see a thing and would just open the water without even thinking anything. Just like our neighbors, (a couple who we shared a table with) fell for the trap. When he asked for \"tap-water\" after finishing his glass-bottled water, I'm assuming Fabio brought out another glass-bottled. How did I know? I heard the guy telling his girlfriend he brought out the same bottled water. Fianc\u00e9 ordered a coke, it came in a small glass (think half of a Red Bull can) full of ice which costed \u00a33.00 when he asked for refill for the coke, we found out in the end that we got charged 2 cokes. Uhhh, maybe you should inform us that there are no refills on soft drinks? Yet another shady move right there. \u00a36.00 for a Red Bull size semi-flat fountain coke with a bunch of ice? Wtf?!? I would say definitely try out this place just for the experience. Beware when it comes to drinks though. Make sure to be clear that you want tap water so you don't get charged in the end. There are NO REFILLS on sodas. If you asks for \"refill\", don't be surprised to see it on your tab in the end. Have fun!",

But you use your five senses, the sixth sense \u00a0if you have it :) touch your plate, your food, concentrate more on tasting it to find out what it is. Focusing one the voices.. And appreciating it. It's amazing how our brain works and how easy to adjust to any situation.

    "text": "I recently spent 7 days in London during spring break and if there was a \"must-do\" on my list, dinner at Dans Le Noir was it. The restaurant is pricey so it was tough finding a fellow college student to go with me, but they do offer a student discount! When you enter, someone will explain the menu to you so you may choose which menu you'd like (vegetarian, meat, seafood, of chef's surprise), how many courses you'd prefer, and select your drinks. When you're ready your waiter will lead you to your seat in the pitch black room and dinner begins. My friend and I both selected the chef's surprise which gives you both meat and fish throughout the meal. Neither of us enjoyed the appetizer which we thought was a cold crab cake of some sort. The main did not disappoint and we enjoyed what we thought was chicken, steak, and salmon, but we didn't much care for the vegetables that accompanied each meat on the plate. Lastly, the dessert was what we thought to be a flaky tart with fruit and cream. When we we're ready for a new course or to be escorted out of the dinning room, we would just call out waiter's name and he would pop right over. After dinner, you pay near the bar and have the opportunity to see pictures and descriptions of what you actually ate. Apparently we had: white crab with carrot gel and avocado emulsion for the starer; baked cobia fillet, roasted deer fillet, and pan fried goose breast for the main; and bourbon custard, poached and foamed pineapple, fruit gel, and victoria sponge crumbs for dessert. I probably wouldn't have eaten any of these things had I known what they were, but they were delicious. Now I'm a fan of deer and Dans Le Noir!",

Having said that, some of their dishes turned out to contain some of the most unique ingredients such as zebra and crocodile meat, so all very worthwhile! The fact that our dishes were served by blind people made the experience all the more special. It is really pitch dark in the dining hall, and you realise the frustration and difficulty blind people must go through day to day -- and yet, in this very dark environment, our server Lisa was truly efficient and kind. Not much to comment on ambience given the darkness, but I did enjoy the little gathering space they had outside the dining hall. A great place to chill and be introduced to the concept whilst sipping on a glass of wine or cocktail from the bar. Overall, I'd recommend the experience if you're up for an adventure!",

Obviously, you're also in complete darkness, so I don't understand the higher dress code (as opposed to smart casual, or business casual).",

    "text": "I was taken to Dans Le Noir as a birthday treat, and it took a little while when the idea was revealed to me to get my hear around it. It goes like this...You dine in the dark, completely in the dark. You can't see anything. Pitch black is what I'm aiming for here. And it makes for an amazing experience.You're welcomed into a bar area where you lock your belongings in a locker, grab a drink and choose which of four menus you want to dine from. What you're actually going to get is a complete mystery, you just choose a general idea from Meat, Vegetarian, Fish and Chefs Surprise... Both Mrs D and I went for the surprise and the adventure began.Ushered into a dimly lit corridor, you're introduced to your server for the evening. All the waiters/waitresses are blind, and we had the fantastic Christine. Forming a sort of cross between a human caterpillar and the conga you're led, very carefully and very slowly to your table. You'll be seated on a table with other people (I think ours was six) so Christine helped get us seated and we introduced ourselves to those we'd be dining with. The experience of being so thoroughly in the dark was very odd at first, because it's only when you're so completely cut off from the light you realise how much you can normally see, even at night. Without a frame of reference, it's really difficult to place how far away you are from other people or what's in front of you...Our set menu was a three course affair, with a glass of wine served with the starter and main, selected by the restaurant to go with the meal that we had, and included a cocktail which you could choose to have before you started, or with dessert.The starter was our first foray into eating without being able to see, and take it from me; it's so much harder than it sounds. It was, I decided, after a bit of prodding with my fingers, some kind of pate - I'd already found the toast, and sticking your fingers in jam is actually highly enjoyable. Eating it was great fun too, with a really great variety of flavours in there and the difficulty in navigating the food successfully to my mouth really adding to the experience.Once cleared away, Christine announced the next course. Once again, there was prodding, and this time I determined that there were meats of some description on the plate, along with carrots... All I could tell at the time was that the food was good. I had no idea what it was, but it melted in the mouth.Lastly, the dessert - this was creamy and good, with maybe some kind of chocolate shavings on the top...I'll go through what the menu actually was shortly, along with a nice big spoilers tag, because, once you leave, they explain to you what you've eaten, and show you that, at least prior to you getting your fingers in there, it was all plated up beautifully. It's an eye opener to see what you've eaten after the fact, and if I'm honest, I'm sorry that the meal wasn't longer - it's true... Time flies when you're having an amazing time.***SPOILER***Starter: Foie Gras with Plum Chutney and Toasted Herb BreadMain: Bison, Venison and LobsterDessert: Panna Cotta with White Chocolate*** SPOILER ***",

Also, looks kinda cheapy: the bar, the main hall, the menus - and yet it was 80\u00a3 p.p. and not to forget that we had to wait over 30mins for our table. The staff is really friendly. But I don't recommend it for dinner.",
