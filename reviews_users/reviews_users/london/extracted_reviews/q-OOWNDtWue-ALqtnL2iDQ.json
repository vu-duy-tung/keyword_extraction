    "text": "Firstly, let me say, I have been on a quest for good Indian food since moving to London, the alleged European capital of good Indian. Trishna was highly recommended, and is in our neighbourhood, so my partner and I went, with high expectations and big appetites. We ordered the quail and squid to start, and found both delicious, with my first experience of curried game positive, with the meaty quail portions moderately spiced though flavourful. The squid lacked seasoning but was perfectly deep fried, with the perfect texture. We followed this with the lamb curry and jhinga prawns, as well as dal and bread basket. The mains were flavoursome if somewhat mild, and everything was good, but not overwhelmingly so, which I had expected given the price point. In addition, the service was downright cold, and while I love that they ask each customer for a pound to provide meals for the homeless, I wish we had experienced more heart/warmth from our server and host. In short, this is a good spot, and a nice room, but not a place I'd rave about- more go, if you're in the hood, or if you're introducing delicate eaters to Indian food.",

    "text": "A friend and I decided to go to Trishna after seeing it featured in Daily Candy. Just off of Marylebone High St, it's well-located and the decor is quite simple and welcoming, even if space is fairly limited. You could tell that everything was brand new, with the silverware sparkling a bit under the dim lighting. The staff and service, however, were less than well polished. There seemed to be some communication issues, and the staff were sometimes overeager but sometimes nowhere in sight. For example, as soon as I arrived, someone came to ask me for a drink, saying he'd bring a wine menu, and another server came by just as the first was leaving and handed me a food menu. The first server assumed that it was all sorted, so never came back and it took a bit to wave them down and get the wine list. There were several other incidences similar to this, like two waiters coming to ask us if we needed anything (like water) but neither coming back to us for a while or the waiter taking away our plates while my dinner partner was still eating. The food , on the other hand, was quite good. Probably not the best Indian food I've had, but I can appreciate a menu with lots of seafood options. We tried the fried squid, scallops, grilled prawns, crab and mixed vegetables and they were all reasonably good. I encountered a slighly undercooked scallop, and the prawns didn't have a real kick to them. I think the crab stood out for me the most, but possibly because food is always more rewarding when it involved lots of work on my part All things considered, I think that Trishna has potential, once they work out all their service kinks.",

    "text": "Even though the British national dish is officially Indian curry, most Indian food in Britain is much the same everywhere - heavy sauces, greasy rice and thick bread - washed down with copious amounts of lager. Thankfully, Trishna is different. The food is diverse and creative. The wine list is inventive and there are even suggested pairings to go with each course of the tasting menu (5 or 7). I was on a table of 4, where only 2 of us wanted to do the tasting. This caused some kerfluffle but we reached an agreement. Food was entertaining but not sublime. Portion sizes were tailored to people who diet. Some dishes - the crab in particular - were too rich to enjoy. If you are on a date and don't want to talk to your partner, then this is the place to go, since accoustics are terrible. We shouted at each other all night. Decor is visually pleasing but not particularly comfortable. The lighting is great but the seating came from a Church hall. Overall, a novel experience with a chef that takes Indian food seriously, but not one I'd be in a hurry to repeat anytime soon.",

I tried the \u00a310 express lunch special, which includes an entree plus an alcoholic or nonalcoholic beverage of choice. I ordered the tandoori chicken chat and a mango lassi. Both delicious! I'd never eaten a chat (or, chaat) before, but I believe it just means \"snack\". This dish came with a tandoori chicken and crisp shaven potatoes mixture, naan, spinach, a yogurt-based cream, and a flavorful green sauce. Though the serving size was small, I thoroughly enjoyed the combination of flavors. I also loved the lassi, which was less overwhelmingly yogurty than most. I will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "We discovered this restaurant because of a wonderful experience when we dined at its 'sister' restaurant in Mumbai. The London 'relation' measured up pretty well.The restaurant is away from the hustle and bustle located in Marylebone Village. It has an interesting feel as you enter...initially it appears to be a small restaurant however them it emerges there are a number of 'rooms'.....the place has an efficient feel about the way it operates. The food is excellent and it has ample attentive servers. We started by sharing the Haldi Chiprones which comprised baby squid with turmeric, fennel seed, samphire and mango ginger....a dish of wonderful flavours.For mains we shared two dishes, the Kerala Jheenga Curry which includes tiger prawns and Keralan spices....stunning dish, and the standout for us was the Andhra Lamb Masala with its curry leaf and coastal spices...so tasty with a gentle warmth. The wine we had which was also delicious, and it was the Australian Paringa Estate 2009 Pinot Gris. This was our second visit....there was a blemish on each occasion. We were initially seated in the section which is as you immediately arrive in the restaurant and both times we were located close to the front door. A cold place to sit and a relatively high traffic area....all this in spite of having had long standing reservations, and on the second occasion asking to be seated in section 2, and area in a separate area. In the end we were moved to this section...it did take the edge off what was otherwise a really good restaurant experience.The menu pricing is modest and good value. The food is outstanding and we felt as though we were eating the very best in Indian meals...in India.",

    "text": "I came here last weekend in a group of six people. We were sat in the private room downstairs, which was alright.The food was fine. No real complaints. We all got the \u00a325 tasting menu so got to try a few things. The consensus, almost universally between the six of us, was that the food was alright, at times too spicy, but flavourful enough to continue eating. Two of my companions were particularly underwhelmed by the apple crumble dessert and left their portions on the table. (Indians doing apple crumble? Is that typical?) Nobody thought that the food was good enough to warrant the fairly hefty pricetag of the meal; although, we did all leave the restaurant quite full, which I would attribute mainly to the rich sauces in which the dishes swam. I'd say the sauce-to-meat ratio was in the 5:1 area.Waiters were attentive and convivial. Don't have too much to say about the atmosphere since we were isolated in a room downstairs. So, for us, it was fairly quiet and very private.Bottom line: I don't think this place is doing anything especially progressive or inventive with their cooking. I've been to a number of Indian restaurants in London now and I say (with conviction) that you can find a better meal for about half the price. For this reason, I likely wouldn't go back here in the future.",

Five stars just for trying!They have things like pheasant tikka, and duck seekh kebabs. The presentation was immaculate. None of that greasy curry spilling off the sides of metallic dishes; this was Indian food served like Japanese cuisine.We were the only ones in this particular Saturday afternoon, and the chef went a bit overboard with the selection, but I'm glad he did. A fantastic stream of dishes kept pouring out, each one entirely different from the last.It's expensive, I suppose, by the general expectations set by Indian restaurants. But once you can see this place as a restaurant for fine dining and not some cheap Indian buffet table, it's really not extortionary.",

In particular, the salmon was cooked just perfectly (perfectly!), moist and smooth on the inside, and with a delicious spicy coating on the outside. All the vegetable dishes, chicken and lamb were delicious as well. It was so good that on our short stay in London, we went back for dinner three days later. Dinner was even better, including a potato appetizer and other delicious smaller and larger plates. The staff was extremely knowledgeable, helpful and gracious. The decor is low-key but perfect.

    "text": "Yesterday evening I ate at Trishna as part of the Graze food festival. This works by purchasing a ticket which allows you to visit a number of restaurants and try a dish with a matching wine for a relatively reduced price. It allows people to try out multiple restaurants in an area with a view to give people an insight into the differences you get with fine dining and how much more you can get out of a food experience at the reputed restaurants. I had a ticket for the Marylebone High Street edition. I do not have a bad word to say about any of the five participating restaurants other than Trishna.We arrived at 7 to pick up our keyrings which identified us as ticket holders, but were told there would be at least a 30 minute wait as they were only allocating one table in the entire restaurant to people using that menu. The number of tickets sold for this event was over 100. With this system, this meant they could seat approximately 6 people during the entire evening. We were told without question that no bookings could be made via the Graze menu. As you can tell, there was a fundamental problem here.We came back later at approximately 9:30 having enjoyed dining experiences at all of the other restaurants. We arrived back to find the restaurant far emptier and asked if they could seat us. The waiter went to check and told us that it would be at least a 45 minute wait. We also were reminded that we were not allowed to book a table through Graze, so even this was a tentative placing. We asked if we could just sit at one of the available, empty tables. He went to consult his manager and came back to tell us that the whole restaurant was booked out with people arriving at 10pm. We looked around suspicious that approximately 6 large tables would be filled with 10pm bookings in a place which closed at 11. We asked if we could sit somewhere to have a drink and wait for the table to come available. We were told that there was nowhere we could sit and that we would have to wait outside. In the rain.We went elsewhere to decide what to do. After twenty minutes I decided to phone the restaurant to make a booking to see what would happen. The person on the phone was happy to place us, had plenty of availability and said that it would be fine. Just as I was ending the call I mentioned we were looking to take advantage of the graze menu, at which point I was put on hold. I waited patiently and eventually the person came back a lot less receptive but said that he could reserve a table for us, but that they only had rice pudding on the menu left. Undeterred and determined at this point simply because it was the last thing these rude liars would have wanted, I went ahead and made the booking.We arrived back at the restaurant to find it near empty. It seemed that these mysterious 10pm diners had not appeared. Who would have thought it! We were seated and given menus but then angrily asked You want the food then?.The plus side of the story is that we got our food, and it tasted great, with an excellently chosen matching dessert wine. The ambience in the restaurant is not the best, with chart tunes playing in sterile Ikea-like surroundings, but the little food we got tasted great. It may have been amplified by the taste of a victory (or who knows what the chef had done to it by this point) but by this point it didn't matter.I would like to point out that we were not rude at any of the points above, remained patient and were sympathetic to the business they were describing. It wasn't until we were told to leave the restaurant that we realised we were being duped. If they didn't want to be part of the festival, that's fine, but I believe the way they acted was diabolical and unacceptable, hence my review here today.",

The cuisine is \"contemporary Indian, specialising on the coastal side of India\", which in itself is a good sign (I love restaurants that try to communicate the originality of specific regions, without trying to appeal the masses asking the same oriental cliches on and on). Food was in general pretty good, with a couple of sublime spots. \u00a0The crispy squid and tiger prawns were good to very good, but nothing extraordinary. On the contrary, the roasted aubergines were remarkable, the tandoori guinea fowl was fantastic, as was the dum lamb curry. The list has a number of options we didn't explore, including interesting wine matches suggested for every dish. A sort of expensive option, but surely rewarding given the finesse of the food.On the service side, while I didn't find the manager's attitude too likeable, it surely was a matter of personal taste (the guy is a little too cold and brusque in my view) the rest of the waiters were extremely helpful and nice.There are a number of set-menu options, all reasonably good valued: I opted for the \u00a325 for three courses, and was happy. Price ended up being around \u00a340 per person, including wine (for what we had to choose one of the few reasonable options in a list otherwise filled with wines whose prices are not well balanced with the one of the food).",

    "text": "When visiting London for the first time I wanted to have Indian. Everyone said, \"Visit Brick Lane.\" But my experience with most Indian food in the states is that it's heavy, saucy, and all takes similar. I wanted something more nuanced, fresh and clean. Enter Trishna. It's set in the cool Marylebone area, with a cousin restaurant based in India. Nearby you'll have Selfridges, good pubs, and the hip Monocle cafe. We reserved a table a few days in advance, as the 6:30-8:30pm spots were almost entirely filled up. They brought out house-made dosi with mango chutney and a prawn spicy sauce. Both were excellent. To start we ordered two salads, both nuts based, with fresh, sophisticated spices. It was a fair amount of food, were well-seasoned (but not too saucy or salty), and made us salivate for the entree. For mains we have fish tikka and guinea fowl (which is hard to find in the states) Tikka. The fish, a salmon, was encrusted with mustard, peppercorn and other spices. The guinea fowl was marinated in a flavorful mix of spices. Both were amongst the best dishes I've ever had. We were hungry for desert, but the options looked incredible. We ended up with a lemongrass malai. While we weren't keen on the gelatiness texture, the flavors were refreshing and a perfect palate clenser. I had to work hard to restrain myself from ordering the single-origin, organic teas that also sounded incredible. All told, the meal ran us about 66 GBP (no alcohol), less than the other sit-down dinners we've had in London, and was by far one of the best meals I've ever had. Very strongly recommended.",

    "text": "This was a very different experience from my first London dinner out in White chapel. \u00a0Trishna is a Michelin starred Indian restaurant, which is slightly more casual than its sister restaurant. They have some more interesting cocktails with tea and spice components, which goes with the menu. They also had things like mango lassis. We ordered everything family style a la carte, which ended up being a ton of food, and we got to try exactly what we wanted for less money than the tasting menus. \u00a0The food was a lot more interesting than most high end Indian food we find in the US.1. Papadam and crackers (complimentary): the shrimp chutney had great flavor. It also came with a mango raita, which was fine on its own, but together with the shrimp one, it was much better*2. Aloo chat: served in a in a nest of basically hash brown potatoes. The potatoes inside the dish reminded me of breakfast potatoes with tamarind sauce and yogurt. I liked the flavor and textures in this dish3. Podi jheenga: fried pink prawns with chili, garlic, and smoked tomato chutney. This had a bit too much batter for me, but it had good spices on it *4. Achari jheenga: black tiger prawn with pickle spice. It reminded of a yogurt marinated tandoori meat, but it was plump large shrimp inside. This dish was delicious but very spicy. It comes with some puffed rice on the side for texture *5. Quail pepper fry: a good amount of quail for this dish (no bones). The spices reminded me a bit of Muslim Chinese food (I think it was mostly the cumin). The flavor was good, and it came with cherry tomatoes and green beans. This is a dish that's good with rice. I don't ever order quail, and this was pretty good6. Dorset brown crab: very creamy - a bit too much for me. However, it was a good value since it was basically all de-shelled crab. It came with a garlic chive garnish, but with the creaminess, I thought it could have used some more salt and maybe a bit of acid 7. Lamb nariyal masala: this dish reminded me of beef stew (in a good way) and was great for dipping naan 8. Shellfish pilau: it doesn't look like a big bowl, but it's actually a lot of biryani. There was a good amount of tiger prawns, but I didn't get much in the way of lobster or scallops. It comes with a cucumber raita. I thought the rice could have used some more salt/seasoning, as well.*9. Coastal bindhi: super tiny okra, chopped very fine, without any sliminess at all. This was the least oily and slimy okra I've ever had. I liked this a lot*10. Palak paneer: also not overly greasy or creamy. There was a nice sear on the outside of the paneer. I thought they did both vegetable dishes very well 11. Bread basket: 3 types of naan. These were kind of sad - not great in texture or flavor, and they were cold when we got them. * = I would get this againWe all ended up very full and couldn't finish any of the dishes completely since it was a substantial amount of food. The first round of appetizers were had were much more heavily spiced, and I think it made the second half of the meal seem almost bland by comparison. I did add some salt to some of the dishes, which enhanced it a lot. In the end, it was about \u00a344/person including gratuity, which wasn't bad at all for what we got.",

    "text": "American Yelp friends argue that London is weaker in most areas of cuisine compared to the USA but one genre of cuisine which is indisputably better in London is Indian food, as evidenced by 4 Indian restaurants in London being awarded a Michelin star this yearI am very fortunate to be friends with Trithankar D, who is \u00a0an expert in Indian cuisine. He took me and sister to Trishna for our first taste of Michelin starred Indian diningWe had the 7 course tasting menu as it's so unusual to see a tasting menu at an Indian restaurant. The fine dining ambiance extended to an extensive wine and alcoholic beverage menu. I was very pleased to see that there were also non alcoholic cocktails and I enjoyed my fruit punchThe popoddams came in funny square shapes but were tasty1. Potato chaatUsually sold as a street snack food in India, there was a lovely amalgamation of sweet, sour and hot flavours with crunchy bits for texture. Very moorish2. Chargrilled wild tiger prawnsHuge prawns had been cut in half and expertly grilled to perfection with subtle but distinctive indian spices. This is the watchword of this restaurant - the flavours are unmistakably Indian but it's not in your face3. Seabass tikka with dill raitaOnce again, top class ingredient cooked delightfully with more savoury flavours this time4. Lamb chopJuicy succulence at its best with tikka flavouring5. Duck seekh kebab with spiced pineapple chutneyMy first duck kebab. Now I want to know what I can't get this amazing kebab at my local curry house. Yum!6. We had a choice of main course and opted to share the lamb curry and Dorset brown crab curries. The lamb was OK but the star of the whole meal was the crab curry. Once again, this was my first crab curry and the white meat had so much punch yet \u00a0retaining sweetness in the butter sauce. I would be happy with a spoon, some rice and a whole huge vat if this. if you go to Trishna, order this!!7. DessertsAgain, there was a choice and we enjoyed some cardamom kheer and peshwari samosaFantastic food. My first Michelin starred Indian meal and it won't be my last! Thanks to Tirthankar for organising this meal!",

Trishna is different...very different. It's the deluxe version of Indian cuisine and as my Indian host told us, this is also a place where the Indian upper class would feel quite comfortable. Foodwise, Trishna offers a selection of dishes that I've not had at other Indian restaurants before - such as quail in a very spicy rub, and a crab dish that kind of resembles a traditional Western tuna salad, but with Indian spices - both of which were delicious. \u00a0The service was quite high end, with the waiters being almost too stiff and too unapproachable to my liking. (For instance, when I was missing a fork, it got delivered on a plate laid out on a white napkin.) Interior-design-wise I felt very comfortable here at Trishna: muted and earthy colours dominated, parkett floors made it all very homey and big tables for large groups or communal seatings assured that you're having a swell time!",

It was pouring rain. My phone decided not to show me where I was on the map, or any map at all. I was soaked by the time I finally found the right bus stop. (Yes, I took public transport to go eat at a Michelin starred restaurant. I mean if I had spent money on a taxi then I would not have had money to spend on food. Or I would think about how I could have eaten twice as much food instead of taking the taxi. Whatever. Life is apparently very difficult.) The bus was muggy and gross and a huge class of children got on and their supervisors were screaming at them the whole time. A man sat next to me even though there was plenty of room on the bus and he smelled like a musty mushroom. The bus line decided to terminate 10 stops before Trishna even though it was supposed to stop 4 minutes away, so I had to walk another half an hour. I got there just before 1:30.It was totally worth it.  I thought I died and went to Indian food heaven. The soft shell crab, sea bream, and prawn curry were all AMAZING. The masala potato fry that came with it was SO good. And the naan was so pretty and tasty. The only thing I thought was a bit bland was the cardamom dessert, which was basically a tiny spoonful of cardamom ice cream in the middle of some rice pudding, but I was so full by that time it didn't matter. I finished eating around 3 pm. It is 11 pm. I am still full.The decor is simple and understated and I liked it that way. Service was prompt and efficient, friendly without being overbearing or intrusive, so: perfect. I don't think I can ever eat cheap Indian food again. Sigh. I'll have to start walking everywhere.",

Yet, I would rate Trishna as the best restaurant I have been to period. The five course wine paired tasting menu is transcendental. The flavor profiles the sheer attention the taste, presentation and overall unagi is unbelievable. Like I said, it would give my grandmother a run for her money, and she is an accomplished cook. It is pricey, about 150 usd per person for the five courses paired with wine or about a 100 without. Each of the courses was so dang sublime, I would advocate saving up for the experience without even a hint of hesitation. I can't wait to come back to London just so I can visit again.",

    "text": "Opening Remarks:-One Michelin Star-Located in London's adorable Marylebone Village-Trishna in London is the sister restaurant of Trishna in Mumbai-The Executive Chef is Karam SethiAmbiance:-The restaurant holds 80 people including a 12 person private dining room and space for a few tables outside in food weather-The room is adorned with calming light blue walls, beautiful soft brick and clean lines- it's breathable and comfortable.-The demographic is mixed the day we visited- a few young couples, a large Indian family, and an older wealthy looking gentlemen on his own- all were assumingly locals.Service:-Very friendly and professional - our server did a fabulous job explaining each dish in detail and ensured that cutlery, plates and water was always replenished in accordance with the course of the meal. \u00a0I was also quite pleased that we never felt fussed over or hovered above. Yes, this is a Michelin star, but it's also a casual lunch- Trishna let us have both.-The meal also was very efficient and moved at our preferred pace- we were in and out within an hour while never feeling rushed. Drink:-Trishna offers a substantial International wine list with bottles ranging from \u20a425-135 and a few half bottles available.-They have an intriguing cocktail menu that features Indian inspired ingredients like tamarind, cumin, Indian lemon juice, saffron Tequila, coriander, chillis and more-Available as part of the lunch bite menu is a wine flight trio of 100 ml glasses that follow a theme (grape, country or vintage) and ranges in price from \u20a435-50 per person-For the end of a boozy meal, they also have a Tea Library filled with an impressive collection of artisan teas from boutique family run tea gardens.-For us, \u00a0however, it was a house brewed non-boozy iced tea. We were saving our livers for that evening at the Fat Duck.Food Menu:-The cuisine is South West Indian and most dishes are designed with the concept of sharing in mind.-The emphasis is on simple presentation and preparation largely over a charcoal sigri, tandoor and iron tawa.-They offer an a la carte menu, a tasting menu, and a lunch bite menu, which allows you to decide how many dishes to order and whether or not you'd like a wine flight pairing-We knew we had a heafty meal ahead that night so opted to order lightly with two \"bites\" each. Warning- I hope you have a big mouth because these are not small bites.Papadums with Mango Chutney and Spicy Tomato Shrimp Chutney De-lish. Both chutneys had a good bit of heat but could not have been more different. The former was sweet and tangy while the latter was loaded with savoury flavour.Potato Chat- Masala Chickpeas, Papri, Tamarind, Sweet Yogurt, SevI fell in love with this dish. The combination of sweet tangy tamarind, creamy yogurt, with the crispy papri (the crisp type bits) and sev (fried vermicelli) was absolutely addictive. Tawa Vegetable Salad - Beetroot, Heritage Carrots, Tenderstem Broccoli, Cashews, Kasundi DressingI wasn't as big a fan of this starter. While the vegetables were beautiful in their own right, there was something flat and unsavoury about the dressing.Tandoori Chicken - Kashmiri Chili, Ginger, Garlic, Leg Chat, Coriander ChutneyLovely tender chicken packed with flavour from the tandoor. My favourite bit however was the crazy addictive leg meat chat. Essentially it was little bits of moist dark meat mixed with an abundance of crispy fried vermicelli and shallots. Indian crack, it was.Paneer Tikka - Fenugreek Leaf, Corn ChatI loved the corn chat but found the paneer itself a bit dry and bland.Hyderabadi Dal, Spinach Corn, Basmati RiceThe dal was a little bland for my taste but the spinach corn was truly magnificent. It was creamy, herbaceous and sweet all at once. I could eat a whole bowl and feel wonderful about it.Fennugreek and Coriander FlatbreadFabulous flatbreads and perfect for loading up with dal and spinach.Dark Chocolate and Puffed Rice with Crushed PistachiosA nice end to the meal with the bill albeit maybe a touch stale tasting.Closing Remarks:-Lunch bites for two including a pop and homemade iced tea was \u20a455 ($90) - fairly pricey considering we didn't drink anything or have dessert but one must remember this is London and a Michelin star.-I am not an Indian expert, but I found the flavours on some dishes unexciting, so I expected a bit more from a Michelin star Indian restaurant-Having said that, I love the Marylebone Village and found the space itself calming and inviting, so if I were to return one day I would want to try for the full tasting menu and really get a sense of the chef's work.",

    "text": "It very much pains me to give Trishna an average rating because their food is quite tasty. Their service is SO TERRIBLE, however, that I have to give this place just 3 stars.Ambiance is great. Restaurant is pretty in an understated way. It was about 1/2 full at lunch today.Service is a huge problem here. Not sure if the gentleman in the suit is the owner or manager but he was utterly unfriendly and unhelpful. I felt like I was inconveniencing him by asking questions about the menu. And yet he was super friendly and patient with another couple who arrived after us. Not sure how we rubbed him the wrong way?Our waiter was nice enough but a bit difficult to understand (English wasn't his first language). \u00a0I chalk his lack of attention up to the fact he was the only waiter working the entire restaurant. We had to constantly flag him down for water, the check, etc.Food is great, as I mentioned above:-- Aloo Chat is delicious. Loved the presentation in the potato basket. Definitely order this.-- Mattar Hing Ki Tikki was very good but spicy. Again, presentation was fantastic.-- Tandoori lamb chops were inedible due to the unbelievable spice level and fattiness. The owner / manager gave us a hard time about sending this back but after going back and forth he finally took it off the bill. The whole conversation was awkward.-- Hyderbadi dal was good. Not the best dal we've had but good.-- Basmati rice was nothing special and a bit strange in texture. I wish we'd ordered the lemon rice.-- Saag Aloo was very good. Potatoes were perfectly cooked and the spinach was fresh.-- Bread basket was good. The naan and roti were excellent, the kulcha not so good.Overall I am disappointed in this restaurant. I really want to return for the food but just can't justify dealing with the service again. I understand Trishna has a Michelin star and thus expected excellent service to match the excellent food. Too bad they failed to deliver.",

I must say the customer service was great (10/10). Food wise I went in with higher expectation considering this is a Michelin Stared place. I thought the taste would be amazing and out of this world but was a bit disappointed as much as it hurts me to say it. The cooking style weren't innovative but you will defiantly appreciate the texture on some of the food as it's cooked to perfection and can taste all the ingredients although it's a bit bland or an acquired taste. I would defiantly recommend it for special occasions only considering the steep price but equally I may rather opt for Veeraswamy on Regents Street instead. Being located it a predominantly white area, the place gets full with Americans and Europeans so you will get stared at if your Asian like me. You may get the odd one or two people looking at your food and asking what your having but it's only as they're curious.",

But be sure to heed the recommendations from your host! We went off grid a bit, and ordered the Dorset Brown Crab main: super rich and way too much for us 4. It needs to be split between 6, at least, and to be paired with bread. \u00a0The Tulsi scallops from the tandoor were delicious, be sure to order plenty. The Paneer Tikka Anardana was pretty addictive, the Malawi Jheenga Curry also.I can't say the Hyderabadi Dal was memorable, but if anything leaves a sour taste - I'd highly recommend you wash it down with Nimbu Drop.Just be careful to stay alert for the steep descent to the bathroom.",

    "text": "Have you been to Trishna? \u00a0That's the question I get all the time when I tell people I live in Marylebone. \u00a0So for lunch one day I decided to give it a try. \u00a0I found on OpenTable that they have an express lunch where you can pick from their \"meat, fish or vegetarian\" menu and you receive three dishes, rice, dal and a glass of house wine. \u00a0I thought that this was a pretty good deal. \u00a0I show up with my dog and was their very first diner at 12.15 PM. \u00a0All three people at the host stand just stared at me. \u00a0I finally pointed to one of the three \u00a0tables outside and said \"Can I sit there?\" \u00a0I don't think they have many diners come with their dogs.Food: I chose the vegetarian menu of the express lunch which came with Aloo Chat (potato, masala chickpeas, tamarind, sweet yoghurt), Bharli Vangi (stuffed baby aubergine, aubergine pakora, aubergine chutney) and Paneer Tikka (fenugreek leaf, corn & green mango chat). \u00a0It's also serviced with dal, a bread basket and basmati rice. \u00a0It was well presented and all tasted good.Drinks: I had a glass of white wine that the sommelier brought over which was included in the express lunch.Price: 16.88 GBP for myself which was reasonable. \u00a0Ambiance: There's not much ambiance at Trishna - at least not during lunch. \u00a0Maybe it's different at dinner.Service: The service was ok. \u00a0People were there if I needed something and the food came out quickly, but I wouldn't say they were friendly.Would I go back? \u00a0Probably not because I didn't like the overall feel of my experience. The food was good, but there are a ton of other Indian restaurants in London where I don't need to waste my time with one that's not friendly - even if it's around the corner from me.",

We chose Trishna, because my boyfriend and I love spicy Indian food.The restaurant is very classy and perfect for a romantic dinner. The staff is quick and polite. They never forget that I have a dairy allergy and that boyfriend doesn't eat seafood. We started with prosecco and Indian aperitif, The spices in the sauces were perfect....different flavours and spicy without crying. The prosecco was fresh and soft. The starter: I didn't share, because I was craving for Kolhapuri Jheenga aka shrimp, ginger and smoked chilli chutney. Forget the shrimp tempura! These shrimps are better. The combination of spicy flavors....this is shrimp heaven (well,for me then -)).Main dishes: Boyfriend and I always want to try the lamb chops and curry and we chose for the lamb version. The lamb meat was soft and the spices...nomnom!Although the portions are not too big, we were full after 2 courses. My dessert was a herbal tea. All the wines were excellent choices but the are really expensive. This is the most expensive but also the best Indian restaurant I ever tried. But hey, you will get more than one pie per course so you won't get hungry after this dinner. This is Indian foodie heaven!",

We opted to get 5 course tasting menus. It was quite an amazing meal of various flavors and tastes. It's a huge amount of food, but it's so good. I would come back in a heartbeat. The only mix up was I ordered a drink and they forgot about it, but brought it later when I mentioned it. They removed the drink from the bill.",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to be treated to a meal here through work a couple of weeks ago on Diwali (obviously no one realised they'd booked the curry night on Diwali until they told the asian on the team, but it gave us all the more reason to go for indian food!).After discovering younger sibling restaurant Gymkhana was fully booked they went for this place, which made me very happy - it's been a good few years since I last visited but my overriding memory was that the lamb chops were TO DIE FOR. Special bonus was that they gave us their private dining room downstairs - a lovely space set for 12 people, all wood-panelled apart from one glass wall which looks through into the wine cellar. Even better, they had a special Diwali tasting menu on that night (with the lamb chops on woo!). Whilst it's always amusing how my colleagues turn to me to order for the group at indian restaurants, this took the pressure off!It was a real treat of a meal - thanks to some attentive and unobtrusive service, and the fact that the food was just as tasty and flavourful as I remembered. The starter courses were all pre-plated and the stars of the meal - the lamb chop, chaat and a salmon course. The mains were just ok though served with a lovely selection of breads and soft parathas. Dessert is never going to be an indian resto's strong point but the halwa was nice enough too. It was also the very first time in my life that I've actually sent a bottle of wine back for being spoiled. Though it was a slight cheat - I was sitting next to the guy ordering the wines and he asked me for a second opinion, and I could only tell that it tasted different to the first bottle! Had it arrived first I may well have guzzled it regardless... The sommelier came down though and agreed with us just by sniffing it!We emerged stuffed and happy, and they even gave us each a little box of mithai (indian sweets) on the way out as it was Diwali. I definitely needed the walk back to the tube afterwards! It's a classy date place, or splurge on the tasting menus (5 or 7 courses for \u00a345-60) with matching wines for a special occasion. Also highly recommend booking the cosy private room for up to 12 peeps to make as much noise as you like!",

    "text": "My friend and I came here for the start of London Restaurant Festival, where top restaurants around the city put on special menus for the month of October. Our offer, booked through Bookatable, was 3 courses and a cocktail for 28 pounds - exceptional value for a Michelin star establishment! The menu was available only from 6 - 6:30 PM on weekdays, after which I think they do their normal a la carte menu. The only thing we had to choose was the main: the two vegetarian options were a paneer dish or morel & mushroom pilau, and the two meat ones were kori gassi chicken drumsticks or guinea fowl biryani. My friend and I decided to get the chicken and guinea fowl dishes. I guess it was a little bit disappointing that there was no seafood option, since Trishna is frequently described as being known for its seafood. There was also no choice offered for the cocktail, but we asked nicely and they were willing to substitute a glass of the house red wine instead.We were given some papadums and two lovely chutneys to start with, followed by the starter, aloo cha, which is an Indian street food with a great crunchy texture. Everything was well presented and very authentic. But the true spread was when the mains came, in two small metal serving dishes, and accompanied by rice, daal, naan, a yogurt raita, and an amazing creamed spinach dish. The presentation was perfect for sharing. I was grateful to have the kori gassi, which had plentiful amounts of sauce, to go along with the naan. My friend also could not stop complimenting the spinach dish. This ended up being too much food for the two of us, but impressive nonetheless...I didn't particularly care for the dessert, which had ice cream, vermicelli jellies, and whole peppercorns floating in a cream. But that wasn't that much of a miss because the rest of the meal was so enjoyable. The staff were also exceptional. When we arrived at 6 PM, the restaurant was rather empty, so the manager came over and talked to us for a while. Apparently Trishna was the first restaurant in the group, but they also own Gymkhana, Lyle's, Bubbledogs, Kitchen Table, and the new hot spot Bao. I was surprised because that covers a wide range of cuisines. They've clearly been extremely successful and Trishna remains popular to this day. We got a great deal, but at around 20 pounds for a main, it is also rather affordable and I would definitely come again.",

I normally eat meat most days, but have never been more happy with a vegetarian tasting. Well balanced between sweet and spicy for both the courses and the paired wines. Keer with pistachios and fig ice cream was the highlight of our night. \u00a0I'd recommend to anyone looking for a unique Indian tasting experience.",

    "text": "Refined Indian food, but the flawed staff and manager did not accommodate for the best experience. Indian Accent restaurant in London feels much more special than coming to Trishna. I would expect that Michelin gives Indian Accent a star also (newly opened).The courses have high-quality ingredients, but the recipes are too spicy for my taste (& I eat Indian food regularly). I was told they would make the recipes mild, but they were hot, hot, hot. Overall the courses were good, except for the softshell crab, which was too salty, and the crab curry, which was so spicy you couldn't taste the flavor. The saag with corn, and the desert, rice pudding with caramelized figs stood out.The service is the weakest link at this restaurant. The server interrupted the middle of the meal by making my table literally get up so he could move the table to a different spot (it was unnecessary). At the end of the meal, someone asked the manager if he could call a taxi (since the restaurant is not on a main street), where he rudely muttered \"I'm not a concierge\". He could have been nicer, even if he didn't want to make a phone call.Even though the food is refined, I would still recommend the also refined Indian Accent over Trisha.",

The sixth course was almost as large as the five preceding courses combined and we ate maybe a quarter of it. \u00a0As we were staying in a hotel we could not bring it home so it was wasted unfortunately.Standout dishes included the sea bream, partridge and tandoori prawn, and particularly the lamb chop, which was the best piece of lamb I have ever eaten. Intensely flavorful from the tandoori marinating I presume.Service was good throughout the night. Interesting cocktail. Wine list was good, a little pricey in my view. \u00a0Received several recommendations for interesting wine to pair. My advice if eating here is go for the 5 course tasting menu as the 7 course is overkill.",

We started with the (rich, gamy, and spicy) quail pepper fry and the very generous portion of tandoori lamb chops.The second course of sag paneer and lamb curry was great. They do not skimp on the spices. The king cobra beer quenched our thirst and went well with the spicy fare.",

The potatoes are amazing, the lamb chops are one of the best things I have ever ate, the curry is so creamy and perfectly spiced and the naan is ridiculous! But the best think has to be the around India drink special that brought the whole meal together. And don't forget to round out your taste buds with a scoop of the Cardamom and Caramel ice cream. You can thank me later.",

Nice ambience, excellent wait staff and really extraordinary dishes. We had their five course tasting menu and have already said we need to return to London so we can dine again at Trishna.",

I would skip those even though k know u r thinking, how could the fritters be a no go? All fritters - the shrimp and the cuttlefish...the batter was a little dry, cold, too thick....it wasn't a wow...that was the only weakness. Go for the non alcoholic drinks too. They have coconut and passion fruit plus they r sweet like candy. Also...I wish they just sold a basket of coconut nan!Man...I would eat the entire bakery dedicating the,selves on making coconut nan.Desert: the mango ice cream w noodles and condensed milk sauce was my fave. I wanted to chug the condensed milk",

    "text": "WOW! Such amazing food and amazing service! It certainly is a leisurely meal (took almost 3 hours), but as long as you go in with no hard stop it's so enjoyable. We did the 5 course tasting menu and got a half bottle of wine to share between my boyfriend and I. We both left full to the brim and happy as can be. I am gluten free and pescatarian but the waitress kindly let me switch the courses in the tasting menu to accommodate my dietary needs. Our favorites were the shrimp, salmon and lamb with the pineapple dessert being much better than the fig dessert. Our total for 2 tasting menus, half bottle, and 2 cocktails (plus 12.5% service fee) came out to about \u00a3200. Certainly a splurge meal, but well worth it! If you are looking for London's best Indian food and also have dietary constraints this is your place!!",

    "text": "A Michelin-starred restaurant for a casual lunch? Why not? With a lunchtime menu of two courses for \u00a320, Trishna isn't the cheapest place to eat in Marylebone but it looked worth trying out.I ordered the quail, seafood pilau, bread and potato fry. The starter was small, but well-flavoured and absolutely delicious. It had a kick that kept building afterwards, with my mouth eventually on fire, but it was worth it. I do have a low tolerance to heat though, I'm not sure how vindaloo fiends would find it.The main was enormous. I'm not sure how much seafood was actually in my pilau, but it was still tasty. The side of potato fry was the star. Could happily have eaten it as a main.Onto the gripes...The waiter insisted on explaining what our mains were despite my colleague's attempts to get his attention and explain he had brought her the wrong dish. He immediately doubled checked his pad rather than taking her word at face value and whilst he apologised, he didn't do anything to compensate her for having her main arrive late. Nothing off the bill, no special extra drink or side - in a good restaurant, this happens as standard.Despite a lunch booking, a near empty restaurant and only two courses, it took over 90 minutes to turn our table. I can't imagine how long it takes when the restaurant is actually busy.Good food, average service, expensive. I wouldn't have pegged this as a Michelin star restaurant - if you want a Michelin Indian experience, try Benares.Although I am admittedly still craving more of that quail...",

For this price point might as well eat at Dishoom.....though you might not drink from an as refined wine list to accompany your mutton korma (but you'll pay far less).",

The curries were excellent was the naan was only ok and the the mango yoghurt dessert was frankly diabolical. \u00a0It tastes like it came out of a can with a grainy texture.",

    "text": "This was a fun place to start my London trip. \u00a0Came here on a Friday night with two foodies who far outrank me in terms of Michelin stars experienced and I left the ordering to them. \u00a0I was a bit worried when I read a few reviews and it mentioned dressy. \u00a0My friends and I were more on the casual end, and it was fine (sweaters, jeans, shirt dress).We started with cocktails - I got a Chili Royale (their twist on a Kir Royale, a champagne cocktail), complete with a hot pepper on the side! \u00a0My friends both go the Kumquat Caipirinha (good enough to order a second round!). \u00a0I liked the small details of the cloth napkins served under the drinks to catch the condensation (vs. a paper napkin that turns into pieces and gets stuck on the table).For dinner we had (maybe too many) dishes for three, but most was finished by the end. \u00a0We started with papadums with chutney (tomato with shrimp and a mango), both tasty. \u00a0Next came out Kolhapuri Jheenga (shrimp with a tangy sauce for dipping), Quail Pepper Fry (thankfully boneless), and (the most amazing) Aloo Chat. \u00a0The Aloo Chat came in a vermicelli bowl and had a lovely yogurt sauce on top - I'm getting hungry remembering it! \u00a0Next round we had the duke keema naan, lamb masala, lemon rice and nilgiri paneer. \u00a0I had never had filled naan before, and this one left me lacking - but my experience has only been with plain and garlic, maybe I was looking for more flavor or maybe I just don't know good naan - I'd try this again just to be sure. \u00a0The lamb masala and lemon rice were very tasty, but for me a bit standard (nothing against that!). \u00a0I'm not a fan of paneer, but both my friends enjoyed it.A very tasty dinner with friends! \u00a0I'd come back to explore more of the menu!",
