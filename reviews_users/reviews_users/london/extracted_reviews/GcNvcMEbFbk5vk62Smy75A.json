Prices are quite high and you may prefer to pay a little extra but get the satisfaction that you would get from Shezan instead. I would however recommend the fish for a starter as it was very unique and vert tasty that i actually ordered more. Other than that it is a place worth trying once i guess.",

    "text": "A good Indian find in the heart of Knightsbridge.I had wanted British Indian food to impress, and it certainly hasn't disppointed. The lamb vindaloo looked attractive to me at first, but its 3-star spicy rating was enough to deter. I love spicy food but certainly wasn't prepared to suffer the consequences of that on this trip. Instead we went with the saam lamb. Fantasticly thick blended spicy spinach with cubed lamb perfect for a garlic naan pairing.The tandoori chicken was a bit on the dry side. \u00a0Its meat also was leaner, unlike the factory farm product you'd expect back in the States. Poultry is always tricky, and fattier chickens appear to make for more forgiving outcomes.For the rice we went with the onion rice pulao. What the menu fails to mention is that it's in fact basmati rice stir fried with diced tomatos and perilla seeds. So very fragrant, so very understated.The wait service was adequate and prompt despite it being staffed with only one waiter and a bus boy.Also let it be known that they have Kingfisher on tap; that alone counts for two stars.",

The food was really good, the prices used to be reasonable, and the service was OK too.However, on my last visit I brought some friends and found that the prices have gone up noticeably by a few pounds -- but the quality or quantity has not improved. They also add a service charge of 12.50% onto the bill, but the quality of service has, rather ironically, gotten worse.Also, as we were leaving, there was an unpleasant situation where the waiter informed us that we were about \u00a31.50 short. While we had paid for the whole meal and left ample tip (optional), my friend paid the difference anyway. (I later calculated using card payment receipts and we were only \u00a30.50 short.) I thought it was a very unnecessary confrontation. In any case, I didn't expect a restaurant in Knightsbridge to be so stingy, especially after I had recommended and introduced the place to a group of friends. Sad to admit that I'm not sure if I'll return.",

He seemed annoyed when we didnt know what we wanted to order 4 minutes after walking into the restaurant. After ordering, he came around to tell us our food was running late. That was the last time we saw him. He didn't bring us our food (food runners did) and never came by our table to ask how the food was (he was there the whole time, just never came to our table). We had to get up and go to the front of the restaurant to ask for our check, which took them over 10 min to bring. The food was decent but not special at all, and VERY overpriced in my opinion. (Ex. \u00a314.50 for chicken tikka masala that came in a small bowl and did not include rice.) Maybe they were having an off night, but I would not come here again.",

I also recommend the potato and cauliflower stir fry flavored with ginger, baked eggplant mashed with onions and tomatoes, and fresh tuna curry. There's a wide assortment of stuffed naans; my favorite is one topped with chopped nuts, cheese, tomato sauce, and coriander. For dessert be sure to try the delicious carrot pudding with almonds, which is something I haven't found on other Indian menus.The waiters are very friendly and attentive, and the chef is happy to spice according to a diner's request, so if you ask for medium heat that's exactly what you'll get.This Knightsbridge dining spot is worth a trip from anywhere in the city. Because it's very popular, even midweek, reservations are recommended.",

    "text": "Wow, apparently I went to an entirely different restaurant than the other reviewer....Craving Indian food, we forgo-ed going to a traditional hole in the wall curry stand in favor of a more high class establishment. By the end of this meal I was wishing we hadn't come.Our server did NOT like us, he barely looked at us, and he didn't even ask us how everything was. Now...I am certainly used to how nonchalant service is in Indian restaurants...but this was ridiculous!! The same server who couldn't give a crap about what we wanted or liked was fawning over another group of ladies near by.I went with the Murg Kesari Korma plus an order of Naan. Coming in at over \u00a310 I expected a lot from this dish. Well, I was sorely disappointed. Rice does NOT come with any of the dishes and it costs an extra \u00a33!! What?! Never have I ever had to order rice with a dish, and believe me, I go to a lot of Indian restaurants. My chicken dish was flavorless, I couldn't taste any saffron or almonds, and it wasn't spicy in the least (I asked for medium). The only saving grace about the whole dish was that there was a lot of chicken included. The Naan was too crispy and I was only glad to get it because of the absence of the rice.So, in conclusion: - Too expensive, bland food, rude service, disappointment all around. I wish we had found a hole-in-the-wall place instead.",

    "text": "Firstly, regarding the service that some people complain about - whilst I've heard that there is one slightly surly staff member who can be a bit difficult (and I daresay, perhaps he is the source of grievances in these reviews), the others are fantastic. Of particular note is the exceedingly friendly Kenyan chap who normally serves me - always cheery, efficient and attentive. As with many restaurants, I reckon it's a case of you get what you put in - be polite and friendly, and you'll usually receive that in return. Either way, the service has never been anything other than solid at worst and excellent at best.Wine and beer list is well thought-out with some interesting selections including a red sourced from India which was definitely worth a try. Usual Indian beers available, plus Tusker, which is a very light and refreshing African offering.On to the food. One word - sublime. I've bought, variously from my South Asian friends, Tamils, Kenyans, Punjabis and Gujuratis, all of whom have had nothing but praise for the standard and authenticity of the cooking. Tandoori is perfectly cooked - succulent and well spiced. Poppadums and assorted chutneys are excellent, the mint sauce being one of the best I've had the pleasure of trying - not too confected or overly-minted, just right. Curries are superb - wonderful heat from the vindaloo, good quality meats used throughout and clearly not just a case of chucking in a bit of tandoori chicken in to a heated sauce. Dhaba chicken and black lentils are exceptionally good and an absolute must. Rice is spot-on with the correct texture and level of moisture. Naan breads are very good - properly cooked with ghee. Their version of peshwari, with a sweetened tomato top (and no sultanas/raisins) is a departure from the bog standard naan and is definitely worth a try, as is the wonderfully flavoursome garlic naan.Desserts are fairly good - nothing major to write home about, but solid and well-executed, if not as rapture-inducing as the starters and mains.All in all, arguably one of the best non-haute cuisine Indians in London. Sure, it's a little pricier than a take-away (hey - this is Knightsbridge!), and it has no aspirations to be the Cinnamon Club, but it does what it sets out to wonderfully - top notch Punjabi curries and tandoori in a relaxed atmosphere.",

There were ten of us meeting up; I'm sure the restaurant staff had no idea what was about to descend upon their quiet little establishment. We ordered a few appetizers for the table. Several plates of naan (garlic & plain) and multiple dishes for everyone to share. Many of us ordered based on what the waiter recommended which was the right way to go, but it unfortunately means I have no idea what we actually had. A couple curries, lamb, prawns, chicken. Just a wide variety. It was all very good and I would definitely go back.Learned a new trick to ask for a bowl of yogurt.

    "text": "Really good food! We've always heard London has great Indian food, but both my (Indian) husband and I have struggled to find Indian here that's not super high-end or very low-end, this was the perfect middle ground! We went here on the last night of our honeymoon, while stopping in London for the night on our way back to LA from Sicily. After a week of pizza and pasta, we were ready to go heavy on the vegetables! We didn't want a super-fancy, tasting menu type place for Indian (in fact, we feel like Indian is almost always better not fancy), but also didn't want a buffet or Chipotle-style Indian, which seems to be catching on in popularity. This place totally fit the bill - a convenient and beautiful 12 or so minute walk from our hotel, warm and smelled delicious as soon as we entered. After a longer than expected flight from Italy, getting through customs, checking into our hotel and getting here close to 9pm, we were hungry!With the help of some friendly and quick service, we ordered subzi jalfrezi (masala of mixed vegetables), bhindi masala (okra, onions, masala), dal tadka (yellow lentils with onion, chilis), mint naan and peshwari (sweet) naan. Truly, everything was delicious and a good serving size without being overwhelmingly large. The mixed vegetables was a great mix of carrots, green beans, cauliflower and if any, maybe one or two potatoes, a nice mix-up from the usual potato-heavy veggie dishes at Indian restaurants. The okra was fabulous, perfectly sauteed and a nice bite to it. The dal was a bit on the spicy side for me (a massive chili pepper was in it), but still very comforting and filling. Something about all of the spices in Indian food makes it that much more satisfying. The naans were hearty and well-spiced. I've enjoyed other sweet naans in the past with raisins, currants, nuts, etc., whereas this more felt like a cinnamon-sugar naan, but still sweet and delicious - no extra dessert needed!Of note, they also had an extensive drinks and cocktail menu that was reasonably priced, even including some creative-looking cocktails! They also have a few restaurants in Africa, and it seemed there was definitely some influence from that as well. This place reminded us a lot of one of our favorite Indian restaurants in NYC, Chola. Next time we're in London, we'd definitely go back!",

We went yday, a Saturday night and it was packed! Couple of families there. It was very hot in there and there was no air flow at all considering it's been cooler during our September stay. Our food took some time to come out. In fact about five tables food came out same time as ours, and two guys waited over 35mins for their food. We had aloo CHaat which was a sour lemon vinegar taste but was so good! I'm always so skeptical of kabab and other non chicken meat...we live in Chicago and have great places there and I still don't eat there. Getting the lamb seekh Kabab is a must. Color inside was completely done and it was edible for me! The flavors of that Kabab were amazing! Good amount bc it was just me and my hubby. And we also had the chicken tikka masala. Meat quality was amazing, but food was warm and on the cold side unlike other two dishes. Not that those were hot either. I thought it was be spicy or taste little different since its tikka masala but it was like putting tomatoes into my mouth. Still got through eating it since it was good. At the end when u ask for ur check...you get magic towels and the waitress poured hot water on it and they became hand sized towels to wash ur hands. U get a haandi mint afterwards which is just like the Olive Garden candy you get back in the states. My husband loved all the food whereas I wish food was hotter and tikka masala didn't taste like I was putting tomato in my mouth. They have alcohol. And I order Coke, it came in the glass bottle with a glass and ice. Enjoy!",

We were greeted nicely and put to our table almost immediately. I liked that the staff knew their place and I didn't have to beckon them through the whole evening. The waiter knew when he was needed and also understood the food in a way to explain it to a simple non-indian foodie like me. The meals were great, came out quickly but we didn't felt rushed to leave. It was all really delicious and the whole party was well full on curry-spiced bits of heaven. The only thing that put me off and made me lower my rating was the crammed feel of the whole restaurant and a tad too-ordinary choices in pots and plates.However, I might have been too stressed that night so anything would have irritated me and it should not divert you from visiting Haandi.",

However, when you're at a restaurant in Knightsbridge, you would expect something of a higher quality.Came here on a 'double date', after a yelp event no less. The service was pretty good, our guy being really friendly, chatty and nice, despite us being a little noisy (that'll be free wine at the aforementioned event!) (which is kinda why I've gone up to 4 stars). Food was ok, my wife liked the Egg curry, though I thought my saag lamb was a bit lacking in lamb. in hindsight, perhaps I should have gone for the more traditionally spicy dishes. I thought the sundries (yoghurt, naans, rice) were quite good though(the other reason for 4 stars).",

    "text": "Looking for some quality Indian Cuisine among the infinite options in London? Look no further friend, for Haandi has come to the rescue.Star 1 - How was the service and atmosphere?Tucked away to the point where you'll likely miss it upon first pass, Haandi provides an extremely comfortable dining atmosphere whether you're in for a drink and quite bite after work or are just out with some family or friends. \u00a0With extremely friendly service complimenting an array of table sizes that can easily accommodate any party, I was thoroughly impressed with Haandi even before sitting down. \u00a0To top it off, my party of three were served in under 15 minutes. Star Granted.Star 2 - How were the portions relative to the cost?For around \u00a312 - \u00a315 each, my party of three opted to go with a combination of garlic na'an, two large portions of white rice, and two large dishes of tikka masala and lamb vindaloo to share between us. \u00a0While \u00a330+ may seem like a lot, the portions we were served were absolutely massive, and at the end of the meal we were all so stuffed that arguments ensued over who would have the task of finishing the rice! Excellent Value. Star Granted.Stars 3/4 - How was the food?Since I've now been back in United States for several months after leaving London, I can honestly say that I dream of my meal at Haandi. \u00a0With each dish customizable as to how spicy you want it, I was absolutely blown away by both the quantity and diversity of flavors that were in both the Chicken Tikka Masala and the spicy Lamb Vindaloo. \u00a0Additionally, the Garlic Na'an was absolutely brilliant. \u00a0Without a doubt in my mind, Haandi dished up some of the best Indian cuisine that I've ever had. Dual Stars Granted.Star 5 - Would you eat it every day if you could?Yes, yes and yes. \u00a0Regardless of whether you're new to Indian food or a seasoned vet, Haandi is worth a visit regardless of how long you're staying or living in London. I would personally pay for the owner's airfare if he or she were willing to come and open a Los Angeles location. Star Granted.",

There weren't even that many people at all but there was no explanation as to why the food took SO long.Also, the waiter wasn't very accommodating when I asked about vegan options. He was also not very understanding when I made a few requests about my food. Considering the service and how the food wasn't amazing, the place was quite overpriced. If you're in the area and craving Indian food, Haandi is a good option but otherwise, it's nothing that special.",

Don't waste your money, I ordered a spice lamb dish and the waiter want me to order their 5 pounds little dish of white rice, then when I got my food I realized why you need that little dish of rice, the lamb was terribly spice and the amount of rice they give isn't enough to go with the dish, so get ready to pay 10 pounds for a decent portion of rice. They should stop being so cheap and include rice on all their dishes since the food is already so pricey.",

It feels like it will be yet another basement restaurant, but that's where I was mistaken.The food is superb and the waiting staff is friendly and competent; for instance very helpful when asked allergy questions - they made sure there was no way I could consume any nuts.The ambience at the restaurant is charming with Indian music playing over the speakers in the ceiling, and, as always, when natives eat at ethnic restaurants, you know the food is good!",

Most worrying though was service. Waiters had no idea of ingredients for allergy information! Everyone had a different answer and finally the head chef said he can't vouch for any food to be allergen free. We almost walked out! By luck, a manager from restaurant who was in a personal dinner with family overheard us and intervened to have customized food made for us. We will not visit again.",

    "text": "My husband and I were looking for a cheaper Indian food option and thought this might work. Nope. The food was just ok... I ordered the chicken tikka masala and my husband had the lamb biriyani. I've had MUCH better Indian food. In fact, there's a gas station back in the States just down from where I work that serves better Indian foodat about $20 for both of us. My husband asked for a little bowl of masala sauce on the side and they charged us \u00a35 for it! Ridiculous. We were seated before a table of 7 and a table of 4. Somehow our order was taken after theirs, putting our food preparation behind them as well. Our drinks were absolutely terrible, pretty sure mine was just an orange juice actually. Overall, not impressed that two people couldn't eat in here for less \u00a380. For the money, the Red Fort in Soho is a MUCH better option.",

    "text": "Has a very bad case of \"Indian restaurant syndrome\" whereas the staff are under the mistaken belief that \u00a0their restaurant is fancy. Consequently, the service, while not bad, is a bit uppity; the manager in \u00a0particular suffers from delusional self importance. The decor reinforces just how far this restaurant has succumbed to IRS. I can excuse the palm trees, but a glass enclosed kitchen to watch cooks prepare standard curry is a bit too far, these poor guys have lost the plot.The curry, however, is very good in a very British way, which is obviously the best way to enjoy it - chicken was meant to swim in a buttery tomato concoction. Great fluffy naan, nice not too spicy vindaloo, and Cobra on tap - I'm sold.Maybe if I had made a reservation getting a table wouldn't have incited such emotion, but calling ahead to eat at a curry house? I just don't live my life that way.",

The people are so sweet, and the food is just amazing. I ordered everything off the vegetarian menu, and the explosion of flavors sit very well on my palate! Try this place!",
