    "text": "\"Das Auge isst mit\" This is a German saying that loosely translates into \"The feast is not only for the stomach but also for the eyes\". I rarely give 5 stars, but from recollection Pollen Street Social would certainly deserve one. What is amazing about Pollen Street Social is that dining there is an festival of experiences - taste, presentation, delivery, texture - everything has been considered with minute attention to detail. \u00a0For those that don't have the money or the time to sit through a Pollen Street Social dinner, chef and owner Jason Atherton delivers a downscaled version to London. Located on Poland street in Soho one is greeted by a friendly doorman guarding an unassuming door. The interior features exposed brick and dangling light bulbs to evoke that industrial, casual atmosphere we have become to associate with casual yet refined dining experiences, rightly or wrongly. What you get at the Social Eating House is a truly downscaled version of Pollen Street Social. The former is much cheaper and therefore also not quite as much of an experience as the latter. However is it definitely close enough. Give the Wild Mushroom on Toast appetizer a go: its a good example of the wonderful presentation you can expect at an Atherton restaurant. You are presented with a sealed plastic bag on a hot metal plate. As you wonder why the plastic is not melting away, the waiter explains that this bag promotes the absorption of the flavours into the mushrooms. The scissors he uses to cut the bag probably don't need to be this big and this industrial, but it's all about the experience of eating here. Oh yeah, almost forgot: its mushrooms with sauce on toast, self-assembly required with the separately delivered toast. It's tasty stuff.In the main course department go with the unequivocal waiters' favourite: the lamb neck is simply astonishing. You must get it, it's a no brainer. The girlfriend had the chocolate mousse with an \u00e9clair while I stuck to cheese and wine for desert.It's not Pollen Street Social but it's close enough at that price. Would I go back? Absolutely! But first I have to go back to Pollen Street Social.",

    "text": "Dined at Social Eating House last night for the first time. \u00a0It was my pick of restaurants for the night and I was excited based on all the fantastic reviews...however, I was a little bit nervous as well since I was dining with three London locals with very discerning taste and expectations. \u00a0We were greeted promptly and seated immediately and seemed to have at least three people tending to our table (which at times was a little chaotic and intense, but we wanted for nothing). \u00a0 The place has a great vibe, it was busy and all the clients seemed to be truly enjoying themselves. \u00a0Overall, the dinner was fantastic. Flavours were complex and presentation was lovely. \u00a0 We tried the smoked salmon and the duck \"smoked ham, egg and chips\" for starters. \u00a0The smoked salmon was delicate and wonderful and the duck was overall tasty, unique and filling. \u00a0 I had the baked curried hake (which I feel I need to add, I rarely like anything with curry..and in fact didn't realize it was a curried dish..when the waiter suggested it) and it was outstanding. \u00a0Two of my companions shared a 45 day aged steak for two that they both (despite themselves- being self-proclaimed steak experts) thoroughly enjoyed (and they have had every steak in London). \u00a0The fourth in our party had the mac & cheese, which was really quite good...though not remarkable. Lastly, we tried the wagon wheel for dessert...which for me was one of the few flat notes of the food. \u00a0It was good...but not mind-bending for what other reviewers noted. \u00a0Also, be warned it is exceptionally sweet...like eye watering sweet (and I love dessert). There are few other small things I feel compelled to mention for this place to be exceptional and I believe this place could be exceptional. \u00a0The first to note- it is extremely loud (as many others have mentioned). \u00a0The restaurant would benefit greatly to change up some of the ceiling and/or exposed brick walls and put up some panelling type fa\u00e7ade /art to absorb some of the crushing sound...it's like being at an American sports bar (not the feel I think they are going for). \u00a0Second, some of the dishes were a bit over salted...and for a place with this pedigree behind it, there should be someone tasting the food (who is not a smoker) to ensure this amateur misstep does not happen to such good food. Also, it is definitely a bit pricey...however, I would definitely return.",

    "text": "Good food is worth waiting for and I have waited to eat at the Social Eating House for many, many months. After pay day, I reserved a table for 9:30pm. Above is a Jar of food. The description on the menu classes the 'Jars' as something to eat whilst drinking. So we did and on the waiters recommendations we went for the duck rillet with chutney. My fianc\u00e9 and I both were craving pate and this was perfect for that craving. After the first bite we both went into our own happy places as we took a moment to enjoy our food and then commented on the indian spices. Then to our surprise they were served with Poppadoms. Great crunch and lovely chilli and chutney flavours suited the duck perfectly. For starters we had the Scallop Ceviche and Smoked Salmon. I actually preferred the salmon, but really enjoyed the Scallops too. They were nice and soft and the lemon, lime sauce added a great taste to the dish. It was a lovely way to continue the meal and set me up with a ready belly for the main courses. I had lamb with asparagus and a mashed peas. The lamb came in four ways- only I can think of three, These were the kidney, the lamb shoulder and the neck of lamb. All were amazing and to be honest I am not sure which was which but they were all cooked perfectly. My fiance had Hake for her main and this was with air cured ham and a mascarpone sauce. This combination of rich sauce and lovely ham made the fish delightful and very filling. After sharing these two dishes we were completely stuffed. However, I had waited so long so we had to get a desert too. So the two deserts i had are equal to food heaven. the reason was because Laura and I both received 'DEATH BY CHOCOLATE'. These two were unbelievable and I am so glad we had them. We were actually lucky to get the chocolate nemesis- compliments of the chef and amazing service from the team (which was evident throughout). This even came out after a pre-desert - free from the restaurant of mojito sorbet and meringue-WOW to all three deserts we had.Rich, delicate, foamy, soft, tasty and amazing. Amazing is the word to describe this place. I can't wait to go to Jason Atherton's other restaurants.",

    "text": "We took friends from The States to Social Eating House for NYE dinner and it exceeded our expectations. The set menu started with a variety of snacks, all a little different from anything I'd had before and all very good. Even the simplest pieces, like the prawn crackers with soy sauce was incredible. The soy sauce included peppercorn and it gave the soy a nice little kick. Four items stood out above the rest: halibut with chicken tortellini, venison, lamb neck, and the peanut butter & jelly donut dessert. Each would have been a mouthwatering star on their own, but as part of a brilliant 8-course meal, it blew us away. The only negative was the brie with truffles, which no one at the table took more than a few bites of. The only specialty cocktail we tried was the Vitamin C Vespers, which was smooth and refreshing. Highly recommended. The staff was excellent and explained every course, although the various accents cost us a complete understanding of every dish. The NYE set meal wasn't cheap, but everyone agreed it was more than worth it for the incredible meal and dining experience. When we walked out of the restaurant nearly 4 HOURS after we sat down, we were a satisfied group. Bravo to Social Eating House and thanks for a great NYE!",

The smoked duck ham, egg & chips starter was a \"deconstruction concept\" miss. My husband and i both had fish, again good, not great. For dessert, we went for their attempt at apple pie, a big let down for two Americans. Considering the reviews, Social may just be more suited for the British appetite.",

I could make out it was a restaurant, and was curious about it as there was no signage and it always seemed to be pretty dark inside. I decided to take an out of town friend there to give it a try. I was taking a bit of a risk, but it was all paid off. I didn't make reservations, but they were able to seat us immediately at the bar next to the window. The menu looked quite interesting and we settled on roasted monkfish lion and lamb neck fillet which were two popular dishes on the menu. The dishes came, simple and elegant, just the way I want my food and the flavors were spot on. My friend couldn't stop raving about how delicious the monkfish was. We still have room for dessert and I ordered London honey almond sponge with goat cheese curd ice-cream. There were so many flavors and textures on the plate, but they all played off each other perfectly. It was a perfect ending to the meal. I will go back and try some other dishes for sure.",

    "text": "I dined at Pollen Street Social for the first time last week then not a week later found myself at Social Eating House for a meal with two friends for my birthday (my choice). I LOVED Pollen Street Social. I wanted to love this, and I did at the time, but the more I think about it the more uncomfortable I become. In short, the experience was great thanks to good service and nice ambiance. My food was very good (although lacks the ingenuity of Pollen Street) but my companions' food less so. Overall it was a little hit and miss and at \u00a370 a head for 2 courses, one pudding between three and two bottles of house wine at \u00a320 a bottle I feel a little deflated today.Weirdly, I'd go again. There's definitely something about it, and I sense it has the ambition to sort itself out.We started in the bar which was pleasant although definitely more suited to the winter months thanks for the speakeasy feel. The cocktail menu is different and adventurous. Service was excellent throughout the drinks and meal. The ambiance in the main restaurant was great - buzzy but not too loud, decent space between tables etc. The room is quite small yet there were an awful lot of staff. Just an observation.I had the wild boar ravioli to start. It was actually just one ravioli but it was nice and deep and it was superb. Definitely the best bit of the night. I thought the tomato sauce around the edge was a little tart so it was best avoided if you wanted to really taste the meat. The pepper grinder which actually had \"heart and kidney\" in was a nice touch. One of my companions ordered the duck \"ham egg and chips\" which I thought was a little stingy. No complaints from him, but he wasn't raving about it.For my main I ordered the confit lamb neck. It was delicious and easily the best dish on the table. I found the ricotta mash a little uninteresting, but it was very creamy and smooth. One of my friends ordered rump steak, which I think is a mistake somewhere like this, but regardless, it was nothing more than a standard steak - no clever presentation or added flavours... It came with peppercorn AND Bearnaise sauce which to me is a dream, but I'm sure many would find this a little odd and uninspiring. The triple cooked duck fat chips looked a little anemic and under done. Nothing spectacular about this dish at all, but if you will order steak...My other friend ordered macaroni cheese. As it happens not because she's a vegetarian, but because she loves macaroni cheese. Big mistake. This dish was a massive flop. It was a pathetic portion, and had no interesting textures or flavours. As the previous reviewer says it was just macaroni pasta and bechemal. Some strong cheddar or SOMETHING is needed. Not good enough at all. Vegetarians who had nothing else to chose from on the menu will undoubtedly leave feeling very hard done by,For pudding we shared the chocolate mouse with salted caramel eclair. The mousse was fantastic, the salted caramel ice cream also very good. I don't know much about sweet things, I usually pass, but the pastry of the eclair tasted wrong... maybe old, or just not prepared well.We had house white wine with our meal in a bid to keep the cost reasonable. It was Sauvignon Mauzac and very nice indeed, particularly at \u00a320 a bottle. I'd order it again even if I wasn't watching the pennies.So then the bill came. \u00a370 a head. We didn't have three full courses (we shared one dessert between three and the macaroni main was half the price of a meal main) and we had two bottles of house wine at \u00a320 a bottle. We bumped it up by starting with a cocktail each, but at \u00a39 they hardly break the bank. For \u00a370 a head, with all of those considerations it just wasn't good enough. I was pretty happy, but my friends would have been less so and I feel pretty aggrieved that my choice and my birthday left my companions feeling a little flat and \u00a370 worse off.",

    "text": "Absolutely excellent spot by one of my favourite British chefs James Atherton. Full disclosure I only had drinks here at the upstairs bar (where half is reserve red for no reservations) and that's the 5 star review as I can't comment on the food, but the decor, lighting, art, music and exceptional attention to every detail really impressed me. Definitely book ahead no matter what. Oh, and the drinks. It may have one of the most creative and unique cocktail list I have ever seen, with drinks served in pill bottles, soda cans, clay pots. A wonderful experience. The Rye n' Air cocktail was my personal favourite. Can't wait to eat here.",

    "text": "Love a well crafted cocktail so obviously I fell in love with this place immediately. The two floor eatery reminds me of Stanton Social back in NYC. Upstairs, a full bar and seating area and downstairs a restaurant. Unfortunately we had no reservations on Friday night meaning that we waited for about an hour. The wait wasn't so awful considering the delicious drinks we were throwing back upstairs. The place is a cute spot, warmly lit, serving some amazing food.That night we decided on the Scottish scallop cevich\u00e9 and Umbrian black truffle salami both amazing choices. The salami with hint of truffle was absolutely amazing. The porc entree was absolutely tender, juicy and very well prepared. This place definitely a date hotspot, girls night out or should I say hens night out. Definitely worth a visit even just for the craft cocktails.",

    "text": "After searching for Michelin starred restaurants in UK, I have decided to put my money in the Social eating house. \u00a0Well, the truth is that I've only been to the upstairs bar so far since that's what my budget can afford ( or not :p)We arrived around 7pm, there was no line up but was instructed by the door man that we have to wait for around 20 mins since it's full inside. \u00a0We waited for about 30-40 mins in the end but the doorman was very nice with updates and apologizes so the wait was pleasant. The decor of the place is very nice outside and inside, when we reached upstairs, the host greeted as promptly letting us know that we can wait by the bar until a seat opens up. We were served with water right away at the bar, which is rare and nice feeling. Before we can order, the wait staff has found us a seat in the nice couch area.All the cocktail options are very interesting, I would like to try every single one eventually. the snack food options look good too. We ended up ordering 4 cocktails and 1 hummus plate. All very good. the bill came up to around \u00a360.The decort was nice, the service was nice, the food and drink are good. they didn't over pack the place. Yes it was pricey for just drinks but I'm already determined to come back for a few more times! =)",

    "text": "Compared with my experience eating at Jason Atherton's Pollen Street Social earlier in the week, this restaurant was much more up my alley. It's not cheap, but I think it is a good, young, hip atmosphere and the food is well priced. I came here with 4 friends on a Saturday evening, and we sat leisurely at the table as the late members of our group arrived. For starters, we ordered the jar of smoked burrata, the Jerusalem artichoke with jamon iberico and spring truffle, and the roasted foie gras. I thought the foie gras was quite disappointing, as it had a consistency more akin to meat / cooked offal than of foie gras that I would spread across bread. I didn't get to eat much of the burrata, as my vegetarian friend finished off most of it, but the Jerusalem artichoke dish was simply amazing. The truffles were cut into thin slices, not just grated, and it infused the artichoke milk on the plate, and went so well with the jamon iberico and roasted Jerusalem artichoke. I would definitely recommend it.For the main, I got the roasted Cornish cod, which sat on top of a beautiful mushroom sauce. I was very full by that point, but it was so good that I couldn't resist finishing it. The one thing I would note is that is was fairly salty. My friends ordered the mac n cheese, which looked good, and a vegetarian warm salad dish. Unconventional as it is, the warm salad was a mix of cooked / roasted vegetables, which came with a separate jar of sauce, and it looked very appetizing. The last thing I must note is that we got a bottle of the Pollen Street Social Selection, and it was such an interesting wine. It was smoky, with a whisky like flavor, but still rather easy to drink. We were a table of diverse wine tastes, but after we tried some of this, it was just something we had to have more of. We had a great time dining at the restaurant, and I would definitely come back.",

Melted in your mouth and matched perfectly with the gingerbread and grape molasses. My boyfriend got the smoked angus tar tar which also melted in your mouth and tasted incredible.For the main I got the lamp rump with confit neck which was delicious however my boyfriend got the venison loin which is definitely what I'll be getting next time! Flavors matched perfectly and the staff was incredibly nice. Definitely a must try for everyone if they feel like splurging :)",

We had the scallops ceviche appetiser which my wife loved but I found there to be too much of the ceviche marinade on the plate overpowering the scallop. Needed an edit or a stronger fish. The lamb however was amazing. Had a number of takes on this lately but this is the winner by a mile. Rump was perfectly cooked and tender and the confit neck had loads of flavour. The sauce was amazing and the mint yogurt added a nice accent. Would come back just for this dish. My wife had the cod which was perfectly cooked although she thought the tempura? flakes didn't add anything while I really liked the texture contrast to the soft fish and pur\u00e9e. We skipped dessert.I'd rate this one over Little Social and just behind Pollen Street which has better atmosphere.",

    "text": "The Social Eating House is the newest creation of chef Jason Atherton from the famed Pollen Street Social. Since opening just a few weeks ago on Poland Street, the Social Eating House has become the talk of the Soho restaurant scene. I went last night with 4 friends to see if it lives up to the hype.As we arrived an hour early to my 9:15pm reservation, I ventured upstairs to the buzzing cocktail bar on the upper floor which serves very inventive twists on cocktails. One of my friends had the Silver Screen 9 which was a Popcorn infused bourbon and coke drink served with a mini tub of popcorn attached to the glass! My cocktail was entitled are you a Mexican or Mexican't which was a nice play on a grapefruit flavoured margarita. As we had a very late reservation, I also treated myself to a pre-dinner snack---a delicious pork belly slider, tasty sliced marinate pork on a brioche. It's juicy, so be careful when eating! The only drawback to the cocktail lounge is the rather low ceilings; even with a mirrored ceiling, I would have felt a bit claustrophobic if I wasn't seated. After a few welcome drinks, it was time for the main event and we were escorted by the hostess downstairs. The whole vibe here is of a high-end scene-y speakeasy, but don't worry it actually works! For dinner I had one of the steak specials (all the specials were steak, including a \u00a377 cote de boeuf for 2). I elected for a cheaper option, but for \u00a318.50 the bavette came with a side of duck fat chips and a salad---which is reasonable value and cheaper than Burger & Lobster for instance. It was a bit unusual that the steak is served on a side slab where you can slice it to your liking and then eat on an oversized heated plate. The highlight though was probably the fillet of lamb's neck, which looked divine, but unfortunately my friend devoured it down without sharing! Dessert was epic, really dug, the honey and almond drenched sponge cake served with a very refreshing goat's curd ice-cream. 3 of my friends enjoyed their salted caramel ice-cream eclair, while the 4th had the boozy B52 brownie cum sundae.Social Eating House is a great addition to the West Soho dining scene. I will be back!",

A business partner invited me for dinner while I was in town and suggested this place and i sure am glad he did!Started out with cocktails on the 1st floor where I was engaged in a great conversation with the barman who was prepping for a competition he was about to enter. Went downstairs for some lunch (see photos) which was incredible - I highly recommend the duck ham started. Ended up re-visiting the cocktail bar later that evening with some other friends where we were wow's with some rather extravagant and entertaining (but perfectly mixed) cocktails.Well priced, great service and fantastic ambience.",

It is relatively expensive but I highly recommend it for one or two!Table service which I thought was a really nice touch. And the bar snacks are AMAZING.We ordered the olives and the prawn crackers. The olives were delicious and the prawn crackers were even better. They were huge and they had obviously been made in-house. The sauce they came with was delicious as well!There is a restaurant downstairs as well which looked really nice but it was a little too expensive for what we were looking for so we moved on after that. All in all a lovely experience and great way to start the night off!",

    "text": "Not to be confused with Jason Atherton's other baby, Pollen Street Social, Social Eating House is his most recent creation. And so far, gotta say, not so impressed. I've had a love-hate relationship with PSS for the last couple of years. We were served a shockingly good meal on New Year's Eve last year, but a couple previous visits on random nights didn't pan out. Anyway, back to the main attraction: Social Eating House on Poland Street -- see? confusing! -- opened a couple of weekends ago, and so I made a booking for dinner Friday night with some friends. We also had drinks in the bar upstairs beforehand. The bar is a bit cramped, and almost feels like sitting in an attic. There were plenty of seats to be had at 7.30; I figure because the door is recessed off the street. If I hadn't known what I was looking for, I definitely would've walked right by. Four bartenders stumble over one another behind the tiny, well stocked bar. They're definitely still working out the memorization of their cocktail list. But hey, a week in they're doing pretty well. The bartender made me a cocktail based on my current drink obsession, the Sidecar. It was bright orange, too sweet, and dusted with the ubiquitous 'a' of the Atherton empire. I went back to Sidecars after that. The hubs reported his Hemingway too sweet, but was pleased with the negroni. The place filled up, got loud (thanks to the low ceilings), and the service became harried for sure. Drinks took ages to be delivered. We retreated downstairs for dinner, which is a sexy dark wood and red leather number. The space buzzes with convivial diners. I've heard this new iteration described as 'English bistro', which seems an oxymoron to me, but I guess I see how it works. The menu is a mix of French classics and English pub-type dishes. I guess that makes it English bistro? We ordered the wild boar ravioli (it turned out to be one large raviolo), which was one of the best things of the night. The duck 'ham and cheese' sandwich was deemed 'just OK', while the angus beef tartare was well seasoned and balanced. And because London needs another steak place, all three of the specials were steak. I ordered the lamb neck, which really illustrates what JA's team does best, unusual cuts of meat cooked to perfection. The garlic pommes puree that accompanied it was probably the best thing I tried all night. The mac and cheese tasted like noodles and bechamel. It could have used some serious aged cheddar. The cote du porc was cooked beautifully and fell apart. We also ordered the cote de bouef for the table with bearnaise and chips. Ordered medium rare, it came to the table medium, but hunger trumped principle and we devoured it in no time. We also had an obscure Nebbiolo di Carema, which turned out to be an excellent bet for the price point. It went well with the variety or dishes and drank well on its own. We'll see how things develop over the coming months, but so far the whole idea seems a bit convoluted. The steak-heavy menu makes it more of a brasserie, than a bistro. But by far the best dishes are the more refined bistro-style ones. I would love to try again on a weeknight to see how if the tentative service the first go-round was a fluke. I can only hope everything improves with time.",

And even though one must expect more people and noise on a friday - it was to much. But if you dont mind this, then definetly go here.The second course in the sampler menu was an artichoke/truffle dish that blew me away. But even this great artichoke didnt leave me speachless like the sweet pea and chocolate dessert.It was so fantastic that I immidiately wanted to go home and try to make this myself - I wanted to relive the taste again and again. I will NOT be able to recreate it, but I'll have to try!The waiters were great, but seemed a bit confused. Maybe they were more that one person responsible for each table, and thats what screwed our order for beverages up two times during the evening. But never mind, they were still both pleasant and fun, and in my book thats more important than perfect waitering skills.",

The white bread was exceptionally good (you can always judge a restaurant by the quality of the bread) - crisp, tasty crust with a chewy, yeasty interior. Ordered the lunch 3 course prefix. Includes: 1) chicken cassoulet in a terrain fashion with greens, pine nuts (great texture), 2) fish (perfectly cooked with a foam and light cream sauce. This is the type of food that is perfectly salted, light (not overly heavy), so you feel like you can keep eating it forever (which imho, is an culinary art). Was only initially going to do two courses, but turned into a third at the end- a coconut creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a coconut sorbet and coconut Swiss meringue topped with a strawberry sauce.

I really like the decor and ambience of this place- low lighting, wood paneled walls, fitting of a restaurant called the Social Eating House. \u00a0The early dinner menu was 30 pounds for a 2 course meal, including a nice cocktail, so appreciated having a really nice value option. \u00a0After having the duck rilllette off the a la carte menu, it's possible that the standard menu might be worth the splurge, but I didn't otherwise order off of it so can't say for sure.Went with a friend. We ordered:Duck leg rillette (the only item off the a la carte menu)- excellentSt. Austell Bay mussels- okayMacaroni and cheese- goodCod cheeks with olive oil yogurt- goodPeach & Jasmine macroon with blood peach sorbet- okay except sorbet was excellentDuck leg rillette - easily my favorite item of the meal, making me wonder whether the items on the standard a la carte menu are overall tastier than the early dinner menu, but for the price, the early dinner menu was definitely a good value, so we went that direction. \u00a0Such good flavors, an amazing mango sauce to complement the duck, and the pairing with the crisps was truly excellent. Would definitely recommend this one.St. Austell mussels- For some reason, these were a bit fishy and some were very soft, not really in a good way. \u00a0I'm not sure what was going on, but this wasn't really my favorite. \u00a0The cream sauce the mussels were in was quite nice, though.Macaroni and cheese- My friend got this and said she really enjoyed it. \u00a0Adult mac and cheese. \u00a0:)Cod cheeks with olive oil yogurt- This was overall well-executed, cooked well, and the olive oil yogurt was a really nice complement to the fish. \u00a0I think nicer than butter sauces that often accompany fish. Peach & Jasmine macaroon with blood peach sorbet- Friend got this. She wasn't really a fan of the macaroon and I wasn't either, but I'm not really a macaroon person. If you like macaroons, you might still enjoy this. \u00a0The peach sorbet was really delicious though and probably the best part of the dish.",

    "text": "We had a reservation on Open Table and started out upstairs at the Blind Pig, which was awesome. \u00a0They came to get us to seat us downstairs after a short wait.The menu is very gastropub-ish. It's pretty dark in the dining room and is pretty loud/lively, so it's different from the standard Michelin starred restaurant. On the back of the menu, you can see where everything was sourced from and how far away the source is. They start you with bread with milk and honey butter.1. Salt baked Jerusalem artichoke: with iberico, a soft fried egg, truffle. \u00a0This was my favorite dish by far. It's so luxurious and has so many intense flavors, but none overpowers the others 2. Confit duck leg rillette jar: with mango and coriander; served with lentil chips. The flavor reminded me of Indian food. The duck itself had most of the fat rendered out, but it was still tender and flavorful. \u00a03. Macaroni and cheese: with Montgomery cheddar, Parmesan, girolles (chanterelles), shaved mushrooms. We've had a lot of Montgomery cheddar here, and I really like it, which is what drew me to the dish. However, it was more like pasta in an alfredo sauce. \u00a0Instead of browned bread crumbs on top, they have tiny crouton bits, but it's not quite the same as a buttery cheesy crust for me. \u00a0There weren't a ton of mushrooms, either. 4. 60 day aged native Cumbrian black angus ribeye: this was cooked medium rare. It was salted well. \u00a0The peppercorn sauce it came with was very peppery and masked the steak's natural flavor, so it's good that it comes on the side. \u00a0It also came with mixed greens and the triple cooked duck fat chips i had been eying. The fries ended up being pretty regular and needed some more salt. \u00a0The price on this dish was good5. Side of broccoli: this was a very buttery broccoli dish, which is enjoyable, but I was looking for some vegetables for the health factorService was ok; water refills had to be requested most of the time. The food came out extremely slowly despite that we didn't get seated until after 10pm - the meal took over 2 hours, with most of the time spent waiting for the food. \u00a0The dishes were hit or miss, with the starters being the highlight.With 4 cocktails and a bottle of the house red wine (cab franc), it added up to more than we expected for a gastropub.",

    "text": "A hipster nouveau-gastropub with tasty cocktails and food and delightfully kind service.Admittedly, Social Eating House wasn't my first choice for hipster gastropub on our most recent trip to London--my heart belongs to another. \u00a0But my other (food)lover was closed for holiday, so I was looking for a new place for a night out with my lad. \u00a0We arrived timely for a 6 pm reservation (alas, the latest available on our chosen Saturday). \u00a0The restaurant was mostly empty, but steadily filled over the course of our stay. \u00a0The ambience didn't seem overly loud, even with a full house.For starters we had the steak tartare jar and mushrooms in a bag. \u00a0The steak tartare was lovely chunky-hand-cut beef topped with \"egg jam\" (aioli by any other name would smell as sweet?) and accompanied by toasted baguette slices. \u00a0Surprisingly, it was bathed in a barbecue-like sauce, slightly smokey and tasting of the American south. \u00a0It was tasty, but hid the flavor of the meat too much for my taste. \u00a0But brava for an out-of-the-box take on tartare. \u00a0The mushrooms in a bag ended up being the absolute highlight of the meal. \u00a0An assortment of three types of mushrooms in a rich beefy jus was accompanied by two large slices of toast spread with cep (mushroom) puree. \u00a0Something really special.For mains, I had the John Dory, a spin on fish & chips. \u00a0Tempura batter and luxe duck fat chips elevated an old standard, but didn't necessarily lend a fundamental difference to the basic concept. \u00a0Mr. N ordered the duck. \u00a0It was a fleet-average pan roasted breast, but was accompanied by a duck cake composed of neck meat and confit. \u00a0SEH should build an entree around this spectacular component, rather than regulate it to the side of a more pedestrian main.Service was attentive (Mr. N dropped his napkin and it was replaced before he realized it was sitting on the floor), but we didn't seem to have an actual waiter serving our table as no fewer than half a dozen separate servers attended to us. \u00a0This led to dessert menus being delivered twice and a bit of difficulty getting anyone's attention when we wanted to request the cheque.",

    "text": "A low-ceiling, dark wood and reclaimed chairs filled den of men in suits and women in shift dresses. Great for a drink (reservation recommended) at the Blind Pig bar upstairs or a meal where you don't mind shouting over the noise.I'm sad they don't do 'radioactive' drinks anymore as a result of patrons stealing the illuminated ice cubes. We asked for the craziest cocktails on the menu and were brought one packaged in a juice box (seriously) with the straw and an aluminium soda can filled with small ice. Great cocktails! The waitress from the restaurant came to collect us from the bar upstairs when our table was promptly ready at 9pm.The brasserie style dining room was very noisy and fairly dark. A cross between casual and upmarket dining. Good for a night out with friends or colleagues when not talking business. Good for date nights.Jar to share - Truffle salami, crudit\u00e9s salad with almond & basil toast - tiny slivers of salame, with poignant beetroot and onion. Very fresh and a great way to start with the wines.Entrees - Smoked Black Angus tartare, radishes, horseradish, mustard leaf (absolutely delicious - small chunks of tartare with the meat perfectly balanced against the horseradish and mustard. I could have this over and over again) //Scottish scallop cevich\u00e9, fennel, purple broccoli, lemon & lime (a bit too much lemon for my liking and the scallop was drowning in the juices so it became a bit mushy)Mains - Slow cooked guinea fowl with foie gras and sweet roasted corn on mash (really delicious and juicy guinea fowl, served with cooked foie gras. The sweetness of the meat, foie gras and sweet corn became a bit overwhelming and sickly so I couldn't finish my dish. But the meat was so good.) // Kentish Saltmarsh lamb rump, confit neck, miso caramel, pale aubergine, mint yoghurt, coconut (the lamb just fell apart it was so tender. The mint yoghurt and coconut were lost on the dish but the meat was so good we didn't care).Dessert - Chocolate brownie, rum caramel, chocolate ice-cream,rum & raisin ice-cream, coffee foam (a really nice twist on a classic sundae with rum and raisin and coffee flavours a perfect way to finish off).Highly recommend the meats here, so delicious.",

As a beer-person, I really thought their selection could have been a little more extensive (only 1 IPA on offer).I ordered a lamb rump as a standalone dish for my meal - it was a decent portion, but the sauce it came with was a bit too salty and made the dish unremarkable. It was alright, but definitely not Michelin-levelNot really sure if my experience would have been better if I had ordered the tasting menu, but I would have to think twice before deciding whether to give SEH another try.",

We sat down and looked at the drink menu, it was really creative, they have themed drinks like \"shire brew\" (if I recall correctly) based off of LOTR and many others. After waiting 45 minutes we finally sat down. I'm not sure if it's because we looked young (me and my party of 3 were in our mid to late 20s) or if it was because they were basically almost closed by the time we finished our meal, but the waiting staff was not very attentive to us at all. \u00a0We ordered our food and it began to came out, here's the good: Foie gras, just get it and enjoy, it was great. The Cumbrian rump (my younger brother ordered this) and he said he enjoyed it, chose the peppercorn sauce, I had a bite towards the end of our meal, it was pretty good so I agree with his assessment. I had the Lamb, it was pretty good, I enjoyed the sauce it came with and it was very filling. Here's the ehh: Scallop ceviche, it was ok, not my favorite, felt like it was lacking, especially compared to the other starter.The bad:Roasted Cornish cod loin...the cod was good, the chowder surrounding it was the saltiest thing I have had in a while, it took away from the dish for sure. We didn't feel like complaining because by the time we had gotten our main courses we were pretty exhausted. My girlfriend ate the cod and had some of the duck fat chips (fries) that came with our steak...which weren't as salty as the chowder.Overall this was a good restaurant and we may have just had an off experience, I would come again if I were to visit London in the future and order some other menu items and cocktails and hopefully it'll \"wow\" me like other reviews.",

And while you won't need sides, there are many tasty options, like broccoli with chili or green beans with truffle. Sadly, we were too stuffed for dessert!One main course came out awkwardly late.

I don't always feel like dressing up and making reservations and being fancy.The food was REALLY good but like some people said in other reviews the service sucked. Went for lunch on a Friday, by myself and sat by the entrance. It took then forever to give me menus. It took them forever to take my order, each time I would be attended by a different person and I was ignored most of the time. Ughhhhh.  Ordered a la cart. Duck rillete with chips, octopus with potatoes and for main course the lamb. DELICIOUS. Cooked to perfection and very flavorful. I will definitely come back to try other items.Thankfully after waiting long time for my appetizer I was helped by Julian and he was a great server. Apologetic about the wait and very kind to offer me a glass of wine. Thank you. Saved the experience.I'll come here every time in in London.",

We were ushered to the empty 1st floor bar and waited and waited until checking with the front desk eventually resulted in us being seated.The daily menu posted outside the restaurant was different from what was on offer inside the restaurant. Specifically the prix fixe two course lunch menu option wasn't available. This was a disappointment was none of us wanted desert which we had to pay for with the three course prix fixe option.The fish portions we ordered were tiny and bathed in mysterious, tasteless foam. The steak which my sister ordered was undercooked and tough. Our waiter arranged for the steak to be cooked medium instead of rare but when it was returned it was still tough.The waiter removed the supplemental cost of the steak from the prix fixe menu but didn't remove the charge completely which would have been the right thing to be considering that 80% of the steak was left untouched since it was tough.Ironically all four of us agreed that the deserts were significantly better than the main courses.Another peeve was the noise level. It was difficult to hear each other at our table due to the loud music and generally high level of conversations other diners were having to combat to ambient noise.I expected better food, better service and better ambience.",

This place proves that British food can be fun, creative, flavorful and a power player in cuisines of the world. Had all local and it was all good! I especially enjoyed my tequila cocktail (forgot the name) which had a bit of smokiness to it like it was on the grill! Never tried Hake and I loved it! I was so full and kept eating because I didn't want it to end! Kudos to having a full vegetarian menu. We didn't have a great table and we were the last seating of the night so it was a bit rushed but nothing can top the quality and perfection of that food. I wanted to take my sister somewhere nice and quite frankly, I was the one that was impressed. I've never been to such a fresh and young Michelin rated establishment. Usually, it's stuffy but the vibe here is awesome and the people that work there really seem to like their job which makes all the difference in the world! I would recommend this place to anyone that's looking for a lounge scene but needs a great meal.",

    "text": "We have really enjoyed touring a couple Michelin restaurants in London. The ones we've visited at home are very formal and stuffy. So walking into Social Eating House with its lively, casual ambiance was really exciting. The food is absolutely second to none. We both did the tasting menu, and it was fabulous. The crab salad is delicious and the lamb was exquisite. I am not typically a foi gras fan, but found it to be exceptional here. As was the cod...superb all around. I also did the wine pairing. The first and last wines missed the mark for me. Both of them accentuated a bitterness in the food, and that wasn't my personal preference. I prefer wine that neutralizes/matches the food. The service generally was very friendly. However, two things went awry for me. My husband ordered a second drink and never got it. That was just unacceptable to me, especially since he wasn't offered a second drink until almost the end of our meal. Secondly, we also had empty water glasses for the majority of our meal. Typically, these wouldn't be the end of the world for me (especially adjusting for differences in service by country) but at a highly acclaimed restaurant, I found these service issues to be frustrating. All that said, the food is phenomenal. Definitely try it!",

I ordered the Sea Bass which was topped with the most delicious butter sauce, to die for! My boyfriend had the lamb which was cooked to perfection. We finished it off with their noteworthy cheesecake. Next time I'd order two desserts since my boyfriend devoured the whole thing. ;)Honestly, this was one of the best meals I've ever had in London, ever. The only downside may have been that the staff wasn't particularly helpful or friendly. I'm American so maybe I just need more warmth. Most of the staff seemed to be French and they obviously have a different style of service than I'm used to. Clearly it didn't sway my vote, I'd eat there again this week if I could!",

On one end of the dining spectrum there is a place like Dinner by Heston Blumenthal - perfect, overlooking Hyde Park in the Mandarin Oriental, flawless service, quiet, modern, understated and classy. On the other end of the fine dining spectrum is the upscale gastropub -- a more adventurous menu, more of a focus on craft cocktails, sure to offer offals and often (what a tongue twister!) in the middle of a trendy area. Here is Social Eating House.Smack dab in the middle of Soho. Loud. Trendy. Plates for sharing. Very sexy. Perfect for a date, perfect for a foodie. We got a reservarion very easily through Open Table on a busy Saturday night and never felt rushed. We started with pate in one of the jars and had a scallop appetizer. The menu changes so my comments on \"what to get\" are somewhat useless. Our entree was the venison --- if this is on the menu, certainly highly recommended, but it was the flavors and presentation that particularly impressed me. We turned down dessert in favor of heading upstairs to try cocktails in The Blind Pig. Don't miss it. James Atherton has an empire, but there's good reason for it.",

    "text": "My boyfriend surprised me for my birthday with a seat at the chef's counter! Originally he had planned to take me to the sister restaurant Pollen Street Social which was closed that night due to a private event. We were both glad it was as the Chef's counter at Social Eating House did not disappoint in any shape or form!! Upon arrival to the super busy restaurant - we were led downstairs to find a curtain in front of us blocking the way and an \"Employees Only\" neon sign. We were led inside to find ourselves in the kitchen at the chef's counter! Amazing setup.It was so utterly thrilling and amazing to be downstairs behind the scenes watching as the cooks scurried and the chef yelled out tickets, reprimanding and critiquing his little minions and service runners alike. So much organized madness and chaos. Reminded me of my days in the back of the house making pastries, very nostalgic. But also made me thankful that I am no longer in that mix of madness stress and chaos. \u00a0Still a die hard foodie though.....that will NEVER change. The Chef Patron and Head Chef were not in that night. James Brown (Senior Sous Chef) was leading the brigade. The whole experience was top notch all the way. I will add also - the wine pairing had some very interesting twists - We went with the full chef's counter tasting menu and premium wine pairing.- Scallops. Cauliflower, walnuts, lovage. Pairing: 2007 Riesling. Scallops were served more ceviche style - great acidity and worked well with the walnuts.- Artichoke. Langres, autumn truffles, Iberico. Pairing: 2008 Pommard. One of the favorite dishes of the night. VERY generous truffle shavings. Every individual component of this dish was amazing - and they all worked perfectly together.- Foie Gras. Autumn vegetables, ginger, dashi. Pairing: Brannland Iscider. My boyfriend claims this is the best Foie Gras he has ever had (and he has had a lot!). It had an asian flair to it - the broth/soup was amazing. Very clever pairing with an Ice Cider - perfect balance.- Halibut / Jon Dory. Chervil root, chanterelles, truffle. 2013 Blanc Fume De Pouilly. Sadly only one piece of the haibut left, my partner in crime had to do the Jon Dory which was no where near as good.- Venison. Faro, golden raisins, carrot: 1997 Robert Mondavi Cab Sav. Perfectly cooked - Sorrel. Grapefuit, mint. Neither or us enjoyed this much. Tasted like plants.- Milk tart. Ginger wine, fromage frais. Served with an amazing Shizuku Yambuki Plum wine / Saki. Such a change from a Sauternes!! Very nice. The tart was moreish!! - Petit Fours. Came in a very clever old school tin. These were delish. Service was excellent - only slip up was one of the servers (not our usual one for the night) rolled up and left the petit fours without explaining what each of them were. The pastry chef saw this mistake and personally came over to explain them. Excellent!! To finish the night they gave me a delicious chocolate cake in a box for my birthday!! We also asked the chef to sign and date the menu as an awesome keep sake which they were happy to do!!To top it off the Pound to Dollar exchange rate had taken a swing the days before making this a very well priced gastronomic extravaganza!",

    "text": "My partner took me here for our birthday dinner a few months ago. \u00a0I wrote the review for the food then, but thought I would give it some perspective before I finished. \u00a0Time did not make me fonder. Let's start with the good. The reservation at the Social Eating House downstairs got us straight into the Blind Pig upstairs. We didn't get a table straight away but eventually were seated at the bar. The cocktails were inventive and super tasty. The bartender chatted with us when he had a few minutes downtime and was able to recommend a great aperitif. Unfortunately I can't remember which one it was, but it was perfect!Dinner was lovely. Both my partner and I had the tasting menu along with the wine pairing (the wine pairing was a first for both of us!!). Highlights for me were the pigs belly which is the creamiest I've ever had and the lamb and the scallop. The wine tasting was eye opening. I've never had wine enhance the flavor of food like that! They weren't really wines I would typically drink on their own. A bit sweet for me but they worked perfectly with the food. Now, unfortunately for the bad. We were sat right near the waiters station. \u00a0And when I say right near I mean practically on top. \u00a0We had a great view of everyone else in the restaurant, but we also had to listen to the waiters bicker all night, which sort of ruined the mood. \u00a0I also felt like they were hanging over me the whole night because of their presence right at my back. \u00a0Additionally, the view of the entire restaurant also made it abundantly clear that we were getting the worst service. \u00a0People who were seated after us got drinks before we were even asked if we wanted a drink. \u00a0People seated after us who we watch eat the tasting menu were given bread well before us and also were fed well before us. \u00a0I enjoy being given time to enjoy my meal, but being ignored for a half an hour after sitting down (no drinks, no bread, no check in, nothing). Is just poor service. Lastly, the wine pours were fairly small, which is alright, but for \u00a350 for a wine pairing I'd thought they may be a little more generous especially if they saw the wine didn't last us. \u00a0This was also a result of the snail paced service we were drinking the wine out of boredom before our food came!If everything was perfect, as I would expect it to be at a Michelin star restaurant I would have given this place a 4.5 or 5 stars. \u00a0Especially coupled with the bar. Unfortunately for the price you are paying I expect the service to be impeccable. And it was just seriously lacking. If I didn't know I would not have thought this was \u00a0Michelin restaurant. So have to dock it to two, because, well meh- I've had better. \u00a0I'm going to rate a total of 3 stars because our experience at the bar upstairs was fabulous, but I won't be visiting the restaurant again (maybe the bar) and I won't be recommending this one to any of my friends or family. \u00a0Better to roll the dice on another Michelin.",
