    "text": "\"A place to be seen. Reasonable food that's a bit over-priced. It all feels a bit cynical & over-sold.\"I eat at more restaurants than are good for my bank balance, well at least enough to know what to expect for seventy quid a head (incl tip, wine, etc.) in this part of the world and Gaucho's \u00a0falls short. At fifty quid I would have been satisfied and rated this 'A-OK' (three stars) but without a change in ambience never more than that.- While the quality of the ingredients was good, it's over priced (even for Richmond).- I liked the wine selection but as a bit of a Malbec aficionado felt the sommelier was pushing more expensive wines over the best value choices.- We booked a table with a view and walked right past two empty ones on our way to a dark corner right at the back, being told there were none available despite booking a few weeks ahead. Of course, by the time the manager came over to explain the previously empty tables were filled by other people.- Staff have attitude, with the kind of the over confidence of extremely good looking young people who really shouldn't be working in a service job.I think I'd like this restaurant more 10 years ago when I was in my twenties and booked restaurants as much to be seen as to be fed. The food is good but for me the ambience undermined the overall experience.This is part of a chain and I'm told the Gauchos in town have the same good food plus a much improved ambience. If you're looking for a special evening out it you might have a better time heading towards Piccadilly .I have to say, many of the younger diners seemed to be having a great time. We, on the other hand, will be checking out many of the other really good restaurants London boasts instead.",

It's perfectly located on the Thames riverside with a view of Richmond Bridge a short stroll away and the food and atmosphere is excellent.It's a steak house so expect steak. If this isn't your thing then you've come to the wrong place. However, there is an excellent Salmon dish that's worth a go. They've got a range of very tasty sides and the meat selection is varied. In fact, the selection process is something in itself, they bring all their cuts out on a big chopping board and describe each of their pros and cons.I don't drink wine but the waiter suggested a red that he thought would compliment our meals which I fell in love with and have every time I go back.Like others that have reviewed it, I use this restaurant for special occasions. It's classy, the food's great (really great), scenery is good, service is excellent, and once your belly is full they'll even drive you along the towpath to Richmond bridge in their golf buggy.You'll need to brace yourself for the bill though, because it'll be big. And you can't save dosh by avoiding service charge because the service is great, you'll probably even feel like tipping more than you usually would. Despite the size of the bill, it's worth it for a special occasion and you come away from it feeling that you got value. You might even feel like you owe them a 5 star review on Yelp.",

You can choose from all manner of cuts, and as with all good steak restaurants you get to see the cuts first. You can also choose weight - they even go up to 1kg, but 300g is more than enough! I had the fillet, rare, and it was extroardinary - melt in the mouth gorgeous. My wife had the marinaded sirloin and that was delicious too. The restaurant is kitted out like a nightclub - all black surfaces, funky furniture, moody lighting and pumping music. I'm sure the last Gaucho Grill I went to was more like a wild west cantina!! Anyway, they do a good line in Ceviche (marindaded raw fish) too plus if steak's not your thing there's plenty of other things on the menu. It seems to average out at around \u00a340/head upwards, so not a destination for the casual diner. Its also tucked away on its own on the banks of the Thames with no direct car access. Beware the walk through the dimly lit & steeply inclined gardens!!",

    "text": "The Richmond Gaucho is the best Gaucho, in my opinion. We only go after nightfall. This time of year it is usually packed since they have a huge deck right by the Thames. I'd recommend getting reservations. That being said we have never had reservations (we eat out a lot and always go spur of the moment) and have always been able to get seated within twenty minutes time - just long enough to enjoy a glass of wine from their excellent wine list. They start you with a delicious basket of varied breads - my favorite roll is the one made with yucca flour. Dipped in a chimichurri so fresh and delicious that it makes your mouth water just thinking about it. The first time we went to Gaucho, my husband complimented the chimichurri to the waiter so eloquently that the waiter went to the kitchen to ask the chef to write down the recipe for us. As busy as it was - that was a nice surprise. And how optimistic of my husband to think we might actually eat in someday and resort to using the recipe rather than just walking down to Gaucho! So naive and optimisitic it's just adorable. I cannot say enough about their charrasco chorizo and garlicy spinach. It is wonderful. Not the priciest piece of beef on the menu but certainly my favorite. My husband usually gets a fish dish and is pleased. He hates fancy high priced restaurants and definitely had a mug on his face when I said I wanted to go to Gaucho to celebrate the night we moved here to Richmond. Now he is happy to go here with me despite it definitely being on the pricier side.",

    "text": "What a disappointment. My husband and I love Gaucho and frequent the branch at The O2, where we eat before concerts and events. When a friend wanted to meet somewhere in Richmond for lunch, I thought Gaucho would be the perfect spot. It's in a gorgeous location, and we were at on the deck. It soon became apparent that although the deck was full of patrons, most of them were unhappy by the amount of sun beating down on them. The restaurant should definitely invest in some sun umbrellas! People were constantly moving their chairs, relocating their tables, and holding their hands up to shade their eyes. It didn't make for a great ambiance.My friend was running late, so I ordered a bloody mary as a rare lunchtime treat. It was very tasty, but had strange hunks of basil in it, that kept clogging up the straw. And... why were they in there? When the waitress took our order, she immediately pointed out that the one dish I wanted (which contained crab) was not available. So, my friend and I both said we would have the burger (\u00a315.95). The waitress said that we must be aware that Gaucho only cooks burgers one way: Well Done. What? Is this not a steakhouse that deals in RAW MEAT every day? If they are that worried about health and safety, should we avoid the steaks as well? OK so I said fine, and we ordered the burgers (against my better judgement). When they arrived, they were, as expected, completely WELL DONE and therefore, like eating burned rubber. The bun was so fluffy that it flaked away, sending an errant piece of fluff down my throat and me into a choking spasm. We both finally gave up on the useless bun and ate the burger alone with knife and fork. For some reason, although my dining companion is a rugby-shaped guy who's 6'2\", the waitress continuously ignored his requests. It actually became a joke - he decided he must be wearing his Cloak of Invisibility. What?So, all in all, it was a fairly standard meal, executed poorly, with pretty terrible service. And a revolting bloody mary.",

We had the fish, so next time I'll try the beef.

    "text": "Went here for my birthday dinner last night and it was a complete disappointment. \u00a0Apparently having a reservation for 19:00 means you get seated in the bar for 30 minutes before getting a table. \u00a0When these kind of prices are charged I expect not to have to send back my Chorizo steak for being over cooked. \u00a0My girlfriend's was also overcooked but she was too polite to send it back. \u00a0Coming from a culinary family, I know that chefs know how to cook meat, and I would think they would know how to here, especially in a steak house! \u00a0When I did get my dish a second time it was under cooked! I did not send it back that time, although I would have, if I wasn't so ready to just leave. \u00a0The near rare steak had absolutely no flavor like a good cut should have and for that price. The even more disappointing thing was to hear the table behind me have to send back their steak for not being cooked properly! \u00a0I don't know if someone was having a bad night but I will for sure not go back.",

When you have greeters taking people's coats at the door and charge outrageous prices for your food you need to step it up and have waiters who know the menu and are personable. This place is nothing more than manufactured pomp in a beautiful setting.The worst part is that the manager came over and told us - not even apologetically - that'd we need to vacate the table because they have another party arriving. When you pony up \u00a3500 for dinner you don't expect to be treated like you're in a Wetherspoons.The two stars are for the design and location.",

I think it says it all for a spot that specialises in meat when the best dishes we had on the night were all composed of everything but meat...The Humista, Salmon Ceviche and Mozzarella Empanadas ...were good indeed and worthy of 5*...but the Churrasco de Lomo @ \u00a340.95, before you even start to add any sides, was average at best and the tail ends were overcooked to the point that they were actually tough and what really racked me off was the insipid Caipirinha I started the evening with, a sign of things to come as it turned out.Other things that did not appeal...the service was erratic and one of our servers dumped the individually ordered starters in the middle of the table and flounced off as if \u00a0she had just smelled a fart?! We spent most of the evening trying to grab the attention of passing waiters and the bloke who originally looked like he was assigned to us spent a large part of his shift fire fighting far too many other tables. They look seriously understaffed.I hope things do pick up here as it's in a beautiful location alongside the river Thames and on \u00a0some warm Summer evening the outside patio would probably be worth a visit but I was left with the serious impression of a place that is more aucho! than gaucho ...",

    "text": "A well-kept secret, Richmond's edition of the popular Gaucho has perched itself just by the waterside, under a massive oak tree (is it an oak tree? My herbology isn't up to scratch). It has lovely seating both indoors and outdoors, with wall-to-wall windows making a glorious change from the usual Gaucho styling (underground, dark, romantic). Possibly the brightest of the Gaucho cousins, I would strongly recommend this one for a romantic dinner this summer, while the weather is good. In the winter, it should also be lovely, but I doubt you'll make it there in time to watch the sun set at that time of year!",

The waiter brings the various cuts of meat to the table and explains what each is, a nice touch. Don't come here if you have children to feed, as there is no child menu, and there are no child friendly dishes on the menu either.I also object to bottled water being brought to the table without asking, and them being charged \u00a34 for it!However, the food is of very good quality, but expensive, with the need for ordering any side dishes required as none are included with the main dishes. The restaurant itself has a modern feel to it, with lovely views over the river.",

    "text": "Part of a chain of restaurants this one has a really nice setting on the River Thames at Richmond just yards along the towpath from the bridge. Wonderful outside dining area and an ultra modern glass fronted restaurant make this a great place for that special dinner or occasion. Upscale and expensive food coupled with good wines and a cocktail bar will turn that special occasion into to an amazing one. Choose the actual cut of beef that you want and then tell them how you would like it, sit back and relax over a glass of wine or a cocktail and wait for it to arrive. Alternatively they do a bar menu and burgers etc but all this comes at a cost, For me it is for special occasions or when I have money to burn, Therefore I won't choose a burger however good it is. It is all very impressive and I love it, couldn't go there all the time as I ain't got the enough money.",

This branch of Gaucho Grill is ideally situated by the Thames with glass walls providing an uninterrupted view of the river, and with a lovely outdoor seating area for when the weather permits. This is a fantastically atmospheric place to go for dinner, with a delicious selection of food on offer. It would be a great shame to come here and not order a steak, but they do offer some good alternatives. The staff are very knowledgeable, taking the time to explain the different cuts of beef on offer. There is not one dish on the menu I would not recommend, but my absolute favourite has to be the bife de lomo, a silky soft fillet steak, accompanied by humitas, a wonderful puree of sweetcorn wrapped and roasted in plantain leaf. The wines and cocktails on offer are just as tantalising as the steak.",
