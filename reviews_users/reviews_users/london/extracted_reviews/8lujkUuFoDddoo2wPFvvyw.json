My fellow diners were happy enough with their food, and my lamb shank was delicious (see photos), but the fact that it took an hour to arrive means, only 3 stars from Phil. Sorry guys.",

    "text": "My daughter and I went in for dinner on Sunday evening and they were not busy with many open tables. We asked for a table for two and we were offer a large community table for 8 people or a table in the lounge. We took the community table since my daughter did not want to sit in a lounge with people drinking and carring on. We felt uncomfortable from the beginning and not welcomed at all. There were many booths open with other parties of two and we could not understand why we were put at such a large table!! Service was very poor!! One server asked us for our drink order and I ordered a bottle of still water and he walked away never asking my daughter what she would like to drink. When another server returned with a bottle of still water my daughter then asked for a lemonade. The server said ok and asked what we wanted to order. We placed our order and he then asked my daughter again what she had ordered to drink. We did not feel as if we were a priority to him at all.Dinner arrived and it was very good!! If you are going for good food then this is the place. If you like dining and good service then this may not be the place for you. If you come with a 12 year old child this is definatly not the place for you!!!!While eating never did any of the twelve servers standing around follow up with us to see how our dinner was. We had another server ask if we were done and remove our plates.We decided not order dessert because we just wanted to get out of there.We decided to order room service and get dessert in our room. We are staying at the Hoxton for a week and will not return for any meals!! I operate a multi million dollar restuarant in San Francisco, California and planning on using this exprience as a learning tool and hope that anyone who walks in the doors of my operate feels welcome no matter where they come or what age they are!!!",

A hotel bar? I was thinking stiff barstaff, extortionate prices and stuffy guests. Nope. Well, drinks aren't the cheapest actually!Big and spacious, almost an extension of Great Eastern St itself, the lobby of the Hoxton is a place for late night revellers, hungry souls and those too stubborn to go home. Oh and those who just can't be doing with queueing and paying to get in somewhere else. One long-ish bar, a huge seated area for those who'd like to eat or rest their legs, and plenty of open space - that's what you're going to get here. They have a DJ playing in the corner; a nod to the party atmosphere, but it can feel a little transient. People coming and going, meeting friends and scamping off somewhere cooler.I liked it though. A good way to wind the night down or consider your next move.",

Definitely a place that attracts the banker/consultant/lawyer sort. Plenty of sofas and many private rooms which can host work gatherings and private meals for groups.

The Hoxton Grille is like 4 places all wrapped into one. You have the bar area which is packed with people trying to get their drinks and reminds me a lot of University. There's a nightclub dancefloor - - which more than once I have had to pull friends of mine off their stage because they were making fools of themselves (one with the English flag). A coffee bar area with patio (haven't been on patio since Septemeber) which is cool and relaxed. And then they have a lounge area off the bar - - with a entire wall that is a window facing into traffic. This is a cool spot from Thursday-Saturday. I really wouldn't mind going here any weekend of the year, it never ceases to put a smile on my face.",

Even with the multiple bars I found this aspect difficult.But once again, I see the appeal. The dance floor in the back will get hot, sweaty and generally pretty sexy. The crowd it attracts are some of the best in Shoreditch - which is something coming from me considering my overall distaste for Shoreditch and hipsters.

I'm afraid I'm going to have to revoke my oh so flattering four star review of The Hoxton Grille and give it, instead, a measly two. \"In the name of what?\" I hear you ask. \"It's appalling service\" is my honest answer.I returned to The Hoxton Grille to take advantage of its Lucky 7 early bird menu. No, I'm not a pensioner but a \u00a37 steak sandwich with chunky chips is just too good to forgo in the name of a fragile ego. Granted, the food was amazing, I had a couple of fruit martinis again, both good with the passionfruit being better than the watermellon but oh, what's this, another Shoreditch establishment with truly abysmal service.From forgotten drinks to missing cutlery, rogue ingredients to the sight of our gorgeous looking food waiting ten minutes to be delivered to us by waiters too busy talking about their 18th Amendment jeans, the service at The Hoxton Grille is nothing short of appalling. We had five waiters in all which I'm pretty sure is a cardinal catering sin and worst of all, having waited for half an hour for someone to give us the bill a member of staff approached our table and asked us to leave because they wanted to seat some other patrons. Shockingly bad service which is a true shame because the food is beautiful and I'm totally down with the early bird specials.",

A surprisingly grown up crowd considering the neighbourhood, and also surprisingly large on the inside, the Hoxton Grill is always full but never rammed. Plenty of people stand around but we always manage to get a couple of seats on a comfy sofa. \u00a0Bar staff and door staff are extremely friendly and attentive, but I am a girl so that helps.The crowd is quite mature even though ranging for the mid-twenties to late thirties range. \u00a0There are a few bespoke cocktails on the menu and otherwise bar drinks are fairly standard. \u00a0The have a cocktail call the Pole Dancer which is *amazing*, only glitch is that it's a pig to make and the bar staff, who are all absolutely lovely, take a deep sigh when I order this drink because it is so complicated and takes a while to make, but it is delicious and worth the wait, try it.Music wise the Hoxton Grill could raise its game a little. \u00a0It plays laid back chillout music which doesn't always necessarily match the vibe of the crowd. Perhaps the venue doesn't have a dancing licence, there is certainly no dancing area, although there are always a few punters (girls of course) having a little boogie in the corner when a slightly upbeat song comes on.I haven't tried the food so couldn't tell you what that's like. There seem to be a couple of private dining rooms in the back for hire if that floats your boat. Also for those who like to know these things the toilet soap is from the paraben free Cowshed range which gets my massive thumbs up (I'm anti-Molton Brown punter in general).Good stop over venue.

    "text": "The Hoxton Grill takes up quite a large chunk of prime location in Great Eastern Street. It is lavish, a bit brassy and brash, but good fun for groups of people. Inside is cut into sections, if you want to sit with your mates and drink cocktails you get the front part of the establishment, and those who want to eat at the restaurant are set a little back.It was a Thursday night when I came, and the place was buzzing; lots of chatter, lots of laughter. I think there was music playing, but I'm not sure I heard it over the din! Because of this I would hesitate to recommend the Grille if you want to go on a quiet romantic date, but if you are looking to kick start your evenings entertainment, then this place is perfect.The menu was a bit too heavy on the 'grill' for my liking - I am not a big fan of steaks, cuts and beef. However if you do like this kind of food then this is a meat eaters paradise. I made do with a starter portion of smoked salmon, which tasted very fresh. We were also given a complimentary bread basket which gets an extra tick from me. This was washed down with a very smooth Pinot Grigio. I'm sure the rest of the wine list is top notch.The Hoxton Grille is a very different type of place from the majority of Hoxtons scruffy venues, but I can see that there is a definite market for this kind of venue.",

It has an impressive and extensive food menu and cocktail and wine lists, with staff who know what they're doing. The decor is fab - walls are flanked with paintings, and some rather strange objects littered throughout the venue (I'll let you find out what they are for yourself!), the Hoxton Grille is a great option when you feel like going somewhere a little less Shoreditch and a little more..grown up.",

Very creative chefs with some amazing talent cooking some of the best meals I've had in my life, no joke. This stereotype of British food being bad has been crushed by this place alone. On this trip I could tell they have gained quite a lot of popularity because it is always so busy, and rightly so. Make reservations and plan for a great evening. I would say attire would be business casual. Prices are so extremely fair for the absolute wonderful quality of food you get. I will always come here anytime while in London.Don't pass this place up, inside the Hoxton Hotel in Shoreditch, London.",

I arrived in London late night, on a holiday so this was unfortunately my last choice.I ordered the Pulled Pork w/Apple Slaw expecting maybe a pulled pork sandwich. I DID NOT anticipate pulled pork molded and wrapped in bacon. It was disgusting. The pulled pork itself was decent but, the bacon was just unnecessary and the presentation alone made it look like something you'd see on thisiswhyyourefat.com.Now, don't get me wrong. I love bacon. I think it's safe to say that everyone does but, one of my pet peeves is when restaurants used bacon to mask crappy food. Oh it sucks? Let's sprinkle it with bacon cause it's just soooo hipster and trendy. The Hoxton Grill missed hipster and trendy by a long shot. But, they hit gross and not appetizing right on the mark. I will give it one extra star only because I liked the apple slaw.Let's not forget that your meal is served with snooty managers and hostesses. Your food is not good enough to warrant bad customer service.",

The first few words that comes to my mind when I think of the restaurant/ bar are : swanky, posh, well maintained, friendly and good looking waiters. The couches are really big and comfortable and seems like this place is quite popular amongst the London Yuppies as its never empty and always buzzing. I opted for a cheese burger (yeah safe but always a winner) which was absolutely delicious and HUGE, but guess what? I managed to demolish that big bad boy all by myself! The burger came along with fries and salad as usual. \u00a0I have to say something about the fries here because I am a very fussy fry eater but the chefs at Hoxton just nailed it - it was not too thin, neither too fat but just right and very crispy (melts in your mouth). The drinks were reasonably priced too, 4.50 for a Corona is not bad at all I say. The waiters were rather friendly and sweet, he even remembered me the next day when I went to collect my bags and addressed me with my name (I was really touched because my name is not the easiest in the world). Verdict : Definitely going back again when I am in Shoreditch!",

    "text": "I've had several (very different experiences) here at the cozy Hoxton Grill...nestled inside the Hoxton Hotel. The first: Room service while staying at the hotel. Absolutely great. Black bean burger with sweet potato soup, side salad and a Diet Coke in glass bottle delivered expeditiously to my room within about 20 minutes by a friendly redhead. No crazy surcharges. Very nicely done, I really enjoyed my dinner. The burger fell apart a bit, but the overall taste was very good. The sweet potato soup I liked so much I ordered on a future visit. If you can get over the consistency of purreed veggie soups (baby food! ack!) then you are in for quite a treat with this one. The second: Wandered over one solo Sunday morning (I'm embracing them, they're numbered!) to enjoy a paper and some hot breakfast. Enjoyed a very decent Full English for \u00a310. Great service with a smile and strong Americano rounded out this meal. Exceptional service from start to finish, even though I lingered a bit to finish my reading. The third: Ventured back to sit in the lobby, work for a few hours, enjoy lunch and coffee. The wheels fell off a bit here. Yes, the fireplace was beaming me to higher levels of existence, the same home-like vibe, cushy chair, an outlet and fast wifi in which to indulge...but I literally could NOT get anyone to wait on me. I would've actually preferred counter service at this point as I'd like to have a few coffees and then lunch but pestering two different guys every time (with hours in between it seemed) I needed something started to get troublesome. I'd ask for something, the one would assure me it was coming and then I'd watch him amble around the restaurant for 45 minutes before coming back and not realizing that he had forgotten me. I'm not sure what the issue is...and it is still a lovely place to hang out (especially with the live music on Sunday afternoons, swoon)...but service in the lobby is a bit hit or miss. So rounding all those together, still a solid 4 stars. We live in the area so we will be back for dinner or to lounge I am sure...just be forewarned the service can range from excellent to subpar. The wifi is strong and free though, and their menu quite enjoyable. Great place to hang on a Sunday afternoon. Live music and a latte.",

Okay texture as it was fork tender, but it was just salty with no other prominent flavor. My friend's mac n cheese w/ bacon and jalapenos was pretty terrible too. The pastrami (salt beef maybe?) salad was a little strange. It was a salad with pieces of salt beef and gherkins. Second time I had the pork ribs. It was average in terms of utility bbq ribs. I think the location gives this place more credit than it deserves. The setting is nice, crowd is young, but the food feels like an Applebee's that doubled its prices. Who let Applebee's sneak into Shoreditch?",

Grumpy faces and unnecessary attitude. The grill/restaurant staff are a friendlier bunch but are not as attentive as they should be. Often huddling as a group to laugh and joke etc. (Even on a busy afternoon), not clearing tables, and not checking on tables.There seems to be several managers on the floor, again, more bothered on being social with colleagues, or 'checking out' the female clientele.Great place, poor service!",

I booked a huge event here, we had 14 people for a conference in their apartment which is a review for another time. We booked a table for 14 in the bar of the grill. I provided all the card details and everything when we booked so there would be a seamless interchange of everything with just a signature from one of the organising party. Sadly the bar staff were literally the slowest things ever, I had to chase one of them around who was avoiding eye contact for about 15 minutes to order some drinks. We then managed to get their attention suitably to make sure drinks could be ordered. However when I asked to round everything up they faffed about with the bill (even though it was all on account) so much that we were late for our table reservation. I enjoyed the drinks they were well made, but doesn't everywhere in London make a good cocktail nowadays? Also they don't sell any Ales what so ever at this bar, which is kinda crazy considering its the thing that everyone wants. So it has a good vibe and atmosphere, but I could probably spend my money more effectively around Hoxton/shoreditch and get a little better customer service.",

    "text": "We went on 26th December, limited Boxing Day menu, which was basically the brunch menu. Food was mediocre. \u00a0The burger, no temperature asked, came out well done. Flat iron chicken had incredibly salty skin. Local beer - shoreditch blonde (Belgian blonde style) we enjoyed. They were out of Camden pale ale. Chips were terrible - frozen and undercooked. My green salad was partly rotten and drowning in dressing. Our server disappeared mid dinner. We observed him apparently enjoying his dinner with a fellow employee in a corner while we were still eating OUR dinner. Very unprofessional as he didn't inform us of his break nor did he assign a different server to our table.Wouldn't recommend coming here unless you're desperately famished (i.e. Boxing Day when everything else is closed)",

I have always wanted to try this restaurant as I walk past the trendy hotel frequently. The restaurant is set on the ground floor of open planned hotel, occupying half of the space at the back. There are 2 dining spaces, with the larger 'indoors' american diner area which is next to the open kitchen. There is a second, smaller dining space, which looks like a conservatory with natural light.The restaurant was fairly busy but had quite a few empty tables, which had not been cleaned. We were instantly told that it would be a 10 mins wait for the table, by a not very friendly front-of-house, and without a smile. We waited at the bar, and eventually after about 20 mins, a table was ready. Our waitress was helpful, but clearly overwhelmed as she was covering about 10 tables. Food took a while to arrive (Eggs benedict and eggs & avocado), and was slightly cold on serving. The poached eggs were runny and done well otherwise.Overall, the experience was underwhelming.",

Then again, I'm also from America and it's possible my reaction is slightly heightened due to being homesick after staying here for 2 weeks :). Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. The chicken was ridiculously juicy (like seriously), with great flavor, and was balanced with the perfect amount of saltiness for me. I also love garlic, so the cloves of roasted garlic around the plate just added to the magic of the dish.The broccoli is actually broccolini and is what you'd expect it to be (steamed). I soaked it in the chicken juices/sauce and cleaned up the plate.Service was friendly and there's a really cool, chill vibe in the restaurant. Needless to say, I'd definitely visit this restaurant again.",

They prepare all the classics (I loved my whiskey sour) and have a few HOUSE TONICS (like the SOHO NEGRONI) too. I didn't find the latter all too yummy but the atmosphere made up for it.Unfortunately the service was useless. There were some waiters running around who never stopped at our table, although it wasn't crowded. Eventually I ordered our drinks at the bar and had a lovely chat with the charming baristas instead.",

We each had an expertly made espresso martini, and the bartender was kind enough to make me a chili infused concoction of his own preference that was not on the menu but thought I'd like based on my telling him what kind of stuff I like.I cannot stress enough how key it is to a cocktail-focused business to have a bartender like this. They like talking about different drinks and new mixers and alcohols, and *like talking to people* and then bringing that together for a personal experience. Anyway, I enjoyed the more loungey vibe to this place (compared to the more retro-designer-house feel of the Holborn location) with its books and overstuff chairs, sofas and fireplace.I still feel meh about the menu (though the pics are starting to convince me)",

While the toast was served warm, it quickly turned cold after a few bites. The poached egg atop the avocado was wonderful, though. The yolk seeped into the toast, a glorious, delicious mess.My friend got the English breakfast, which looked fantastic. He seemed to enjoy it and I believe has had it before. Definitely a great place to brunch and convenient for those living in the Hoxton hotel. I just wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Service was solid, and the teas were good. They didn't use loose leaf for my green tea, which was a slight bummer (I'm obnoxious about tea). But my friend's earl grey seemed to be loose... they just put it in a bag to seep in the teapot. As is true of everything in London, prices are steep!",

We all opted for a burger, one of us had the chicken burger and we got some onion rings on the side. You can have your burger with salad or chips. Us being carb-consuming monsters, we went for the chips.The food was outstanding. I've tried both the beef and chicken burger and they were both delicious. Cooked as we ordered them and with a full taste profile. I really liked the chicken burger, next time I'll be getting that for sure.It's affordable but its also easy to spend a lot of money on the food here. All in all, an excellent choice.",

I was a bit late but when I reached the restaurant I found him sitting in the back. The venue is nice, dark but very vibrant and popular. I believe the night I was there the front half was packed with business people who just got off work. Anyway looking over the menu I ordered the pulled pork apple slaw sandwich while my friend ordered the half rack of St. Louis pork ribs. For an appetizer he really wanted the mini hot dogs. We both ordered beers while we waited for our meals. The food came out and it was exactly as the name describes. The meal was nothing exceptional...maybe because BBQ style food is just better in the US? I'm not sure but I was definitely now WOWed. If I was given the option to go again...I most likely wouldn't. But the environment is super chill and other patrons seemed to really enjoy it.",

The drinks are amazing, the espresso martini is the perfect pick me up on a Friday evening, and on a sunny day it's nice to sit in the open conservatory style part in the middle. I've not eaten here but friends have spoken highly of it!",
