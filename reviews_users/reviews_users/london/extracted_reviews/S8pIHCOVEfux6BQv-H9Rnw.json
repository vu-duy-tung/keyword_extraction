    "text": "The one thing you can't complain about is the view. It's pretty awe-inspiring and the food and drink were great. Unfortunately, that's where the lack of complaints end. I can only fathom that the view is what is keeping the bar busy, because the attitude of the staff bordered on the downright criminal. A dropped plate at our table, before any of the meal was eaten, caused a disagreement over our bill. The manager insisted that we had been given a 'replacement' meal (which we had been offered, not requested) which was then included on the bill, bringing the cost of one plate of fish and chips to \u00a332 and leading me to believe that the word 'replacement' doesn't mean what they think it means.This was clearly a misunderstanding and an opportunity for Madison to show some good customer service, the 'customer is always right' if you will. We weren't trying to take advantage and claim free stuff, but if there is ever a small disagreement, you'd imagine that the customers viewpoint is the one that managers should lean towards believing. Instead this got pretty heated, the waiter branding a member of our group a 'liar' at one point, and was only resolved when we were allowed to remove the service charge, not the meal. The way this was dealt with was pretty despicable - it was an accident and a misunderstanding. We were not looking for a freebie (the first meal hadn't been touched!) but we did expect a minimum standard of customer service that we didn't receive.Somehow, don't think we'll be going back. Though I suppose we might go up to the free viewing platform next to the bar just for that view.",

Only drawbacks I had were when they are open as a night club the food seating area isnt moved around to generate more floor space in the summer this isnt really a problem cause can hangout outside but in the winter it is freezing and you are stuck shoulder to shoulder with everyone here. I came here a second time for dinner and although pricey everything was delicious from the mac and cheese to the burgers and everything else inbetween. Great date place!",

Obviously! \u00a0Having an ice cream sundae to knock the socks off most that I have eaten before, and trying the Petit Pot Au Chocolat finished the meal with the same great flavours as it began with.",

The drinks are ok (but kind of pricey for the variety you're getting) and the tapas aren't much better. The crowd is very mixed depending on the day and there's a minimum spend for reservations.Be warned, trying to get here after work on a Thursday when the weather is nice is like trying to invade Greece at the battle of Thermopylae. Hoards of people are squeezed into the glassbox elevator, made to ferment in the ride up to the roof and then stuffed again into a tightly rope-curtained standing area diligently patrolled by security personnel. Guess this is Sparta.",

Who knew that a top the ugly brown One New Change building there is a sun-bathing gem of a restaurant and bar?! As we exited the elevator on the roof, I felt I was walking into an exclusive club; but the area could not be more accommodating. The cocktails were a little pricey (the cheapest being \u00a38-9), but they were very inventive and tasty. I especially recommend the Passion Fruit Mojito. I didn't eat, but the tapas bar outside or the restaurant inside looked inviting. I will definitely be eating next time. The outdoor seating is stocked with comfy chairs and tables. If you can't snag a seat though, the deck has ample area for mingling and admiring the gorgeous view of St Pauls. Too bad other buildings below block the Thames and other famous London sites, but nevertheless, it's a great place to sunbathe all day and admire the sunset in the evening.",

If you like cocktails you are in the right place. Great Pornstar Martinis and the Long Island Ice Teas are amazing but tread carefully, they are very strong! :)Beer is on the pricey side too but similar to the pubs in the area that charge pretty much the same prices but without the gorgeous location. Service is dependant on how busy it is. It's only natural for service to not be as good when it gets really busy but overall the times I've not been happy with the service have been rare.In the summer it gets very very busy, too busy for some. The bar gets very busy but they have waiters and waitresses walking around taking orders too. Now that it's cooling down it doesn't get as busy but don't hang about if you want to get a seat with your mates.",

Modern European is ear-blastingly loud remixes and long queues for basic cocktails. Modern British is St. Paul's over your shoulder as you chat with friends. Technically, then, Madison is both.The view, as all say, is why you're here. Pop in early with friends, don't mind the queue as it moves quickly, and get cozy to enjoy the nice weather. There are few places that are as iconic as Madison, but the drinks are expensive and not that strong for what you're paying.Definitely a 'must-do' experience, though I'm not sure for more than one 'must-doing'.",

It's priced for the location and yes I do realise that \u00a311 for double vodka soda is excessive, but there is no cover charge and stunning view of St Pauls sort of makes up for it.The service at the bar was quick, though I was terrified when I first saw the queues. Waiters, waitresses and bartenders were all nice and polite - which is a very good for a place that could potentially have the most rude staff ever and still attract people (I avoid such places at all costs).On a Friday afternoon with a light breeze from the passing summer - I would definitely come back and enjoy my expensive drink and probably meet like-minded people as well.The only downside is their closing time. They advertise themselves as 'open till late' but they really are not. After my friend and I had a quick bite at Burger & Lobster and came back for more drinks at around 11.30pm, we weren't let in, justified by the fact that the place is closing. And it was during the summer heatwave. Come on, Madison!",

Think a step \u00a0up from All Bar One, but not a very big step- burgers and steak , and a little bit of mild exotica ( a well done lamb tagine, for example). Would pass for the best restaurant in a middling size market town somewhere provincial. The staff, in my experience, are numerous and reasonably efficient, although the poor experiences noted by other reviewers probably result from fatigue at serving the oceans of thirsty drunken punters at peak times.",

If you are in the mood to splurge and just want to treat yourself to a spectacular view while sipping your drink this would be my recommendation. While I was there, I noticed that they also have indoors seating, where they also serve food. This also has an amazing view of the South bank, London eye area along with the St Pauls dome view.

But I still recommend that place to out of towners who like the scene and want to experience it (except there you get red robes in the winter time).Drinks are on the expensive end but try ordering a low-to-mid priced bottle of wine. Saves you some \u00a3 and saves you from having to fight crowds on a packed evening to get back to the bar.I will say - this is a prime spot come Friday when it's nice out. Watch the time because there is a queue (and supposed dress code) but it moves.Honestly, I've been here less than a month and been twice. The 2nd time because some out of town visitors suggested it but I really couldn't find it in my heart to say \"no, you DON'T want incredible views of St. Pauls and London during sunset....\"",

Even after pestering for it for over an hour. Mind you I did have 3 cocktails which were immediately brought to me. My favorite cocktail was the Hot Bitch \u00a0out of the three I ordered. Spicy and Sweet. The rooftop view on this 6th floor venue gave amazing views of the city especially the nighttime skyline.I even met some amazing people whom I can't wait to catch up with in December on my return.",

With a huge, glass-fronted atrium for the rainy days, a spacious roof terrace for the sunny days, and an incredible view of St Paul's all year round, it's one of the best roof top bars you'll find in London.When I visited a few weeks back, I also ate there for the first time with some Texan friends who were visiting London. The food is not cheap, but it is delicious. I had the Mac & Cheese with broccoli, and it was just so tasty. My friends had the lobster roll, which went down a treat, and the chateaubriand, which they also loved.We stayed for drinks afterwards - the bar service isn't the best, but it's not terrible. There's plenty of room inside for a touch of light dancing, and the cocktails are pretty good.The roof terrace does get extremely busy, and you may need to queue to get in for after-work drinks unless you've booked in advance, especially when it's a beautiful sunny day. It's well worth a visit to Madison's, especially if you're with guests from outside of London or have been living under a rock for the last 2 years and haven't yet been yourself!",

Don't arrive to late, so you can grab a sit outside (there are blankets for the cold evenings) and enjoy the view. The drinks aren't that expensive for the area and you can order some snacks.

    "text": "Oh I really did want to find my new city bar, and this promised so much, but delivered so little. I turned up at 4pm on a Thursday and it was already crowded. In order to sit at a sofa in the non smoking section, you have to reserve, and a reservation means a minimum 600 quid spend. (Well if you all let them get away with it, what do you expect?) So I perched at a table for two on a high stool. A friend then turned up and found space round the corner in the smoking section, on a sofa, so I decamped round there. There were four of us meeting and we were really interested in catching up and chatting to each other over some interesting cocktails. That never happened. The clientele basically comprises secretaries in skirts way too short for their figures, heels that they can't walk in, chunky tiffany jewellery, screaming 'Oh My God' to other tables, and married men looking for a quick hook up. Ok, that sounds bitchy, but it's accurate. Even sitting practically in each others' laps, we couldn't all have one conversation at the same time due to the said screaming going on from all all sides. It was like mating season in the monkey enclosure, where only the loudest and screachiest \u00a0were going to attract the male. The drinks were not good. Very expensive and just not brilliant ingredients. My favourite cocktail is a margarita and I can tell fake 'too sweet' lime juice a mile away - this was like drinking gummy bears. The cosmo my friend ordered had never seen a cranberry in its life and again had gummy bear lime juice. Even the views were a little disappointing, the best place to see them is the public picnic area on the opposite side of the roof to Madison. If you want to try this place (and assuming you are neither a screaming secretary, nor a philandering chap) I would recommend going earlier in the week. Actually scrap that, I wouldn't recommend going here at any time! (They get a point for clean loos. I do like a place that takes care of its nether regions.)",

The terrace views of St.Pauls, the London Eye and the Shard are amazing - amazing date location. Inside it's floor to ceiling windows showcasing a panoramic view that must be awesome at night. Since it was a Sunday that I showed up, it was pretty quiet and I had my pick of seats. No crazy after-work crew like some of the other reviewers had to deal with. I had a glass of wine and some fries and soaked in the sun. The menu is a little on the pricey side for starters/tapas type dishes but the views make up for it. Only downside was the waiters are kinda strange and they brought me the wrong kind of fries.I like the bathrooms, they are large and very airy.",

It is a classy, yet laid back rooftop lounge that offers a breathtaking view of the London skyline, as well as the top of St. Paul's Cathedral Dome it is situated right across.You take a glass lift to the top floor of this lounge, and once you step outside, you're presented with a charming little area with tables, sofas, and a wider walking area where you can opt out on the alcohol and just enjoy the view. There's also food on offer but I've only tried the cocktails so far -- which were deliciously exotic by the way. They're not too strong, but that suits the chill atmosphere of the place. I'd recommend this lounge more for a date spot than a pre-drinks place to get yourself pumped for a crazy night out at the club.",

    "text": "Madison lived up to the reputation of having a nice view of the city, most notably St. Paul's Cathedral. However the best view is not actually from the bar but the free observation deck where you are not allowed to drink. It's a shame because there could be so much more room to enjoy the view. That said, it's a good spot to tick off your list if you're a tourist but the locals say that crowds are common and queues are unbearable. My experience was lucky coming just before the post-work rush and finding reasonable prices considering the location. I even managed to get a table although generally you will wait downstairs without a booking and can expect much more hassle on a sunny evening.I wouldn't be a regular here but then again, it was a nice place to go without a booking, as the popular Sky Garden was fully booked all week.",

    "text": "It's hard to find a good roof terrace in Lonodon and while Madison doesn't have a view of the whole of London, the view it has of St Pauls cathedral is spectacular.It's a good place to take tourist friends visiting London for the first time and a good place to take a date as it's romantic overlooking the cathedral.However, if you are on a date, you may want to think carefully about what time you arrive as it's too epxensive to stay there all night. I suggest arriving early as it fills up toward the end of the night. Only groups can book tables on the terrace.The location inside One New Change \u00a0means you can start off your night with drinks, and go to Jamie Oliver or Gordon Ramsay's restaurant inside One New Change for dinner.",

    "text": "First time visiting here on a hot, sunny Sunday afternoon for cocktails on the terrace. The weather was perfect, got quite lucky. Nice, chillout catch up with a friend over drinks. Not too pretentious, found great seating near the terrace bar, what was even better, we got lounge service, which meant no queueing up! Was treating my friend to birthday drinks and chose The Rooftop - Hendrick's Gin, Elderflower, Lime & Prosecco. For myself I opted for Strawberr'Le - Belvedere Vodka, Limoncello, Strawberry, sugar and Prosecco. Amazing long drinks for an afternoon, warning though - they are pretty strong, so take your time drinking them. They went down pleasantly well.Round 2 we opted for the Pornstar Martinis - Vanilla Vodka, Passion Fruit, Lemon & Sugar, with a shot of prosecco. I have had a lot of these at various establishments, but these have got to my favourite at Madison's. They're not too overpowering, hydrating and even the prosecco is relatively light and enjoyable. The service is really good, drink suggestions from the mixologists are on point too. Was a perfect afternoon. Will definitely be visiting on more occasions. it has become my new favourite rooftop bar in London",

    "text": "As a bar, this place has tasty cocktails and an amazing view but really that's it (I can't yet comment on the restaurant). Booking an area requires a hefty deposit and without that there's not much space to stand, let alone sit.I have been a few times but I guess the last trip left a bitter taste in my mouth. We huddled on a bench area outside one evening at the end of April when the weather had been unseasonably cold having had hail earlier in the day. There were no heaters, only blankets.Friends arrived separately and it was ok until the last person tried to come up the lift and the door staff (at the lift entrance) refused to let him in citing no table reservation. With us already upstairs they then used the excuse of dress code (black leather trainers) which I think is a bit much for a bar on a Thursday night.With no other choice we finished our drinks and joined our friend. We moved on to The Happenstance where the drinks were cheaper and the staff really welcoming.",

When the suns out there no place better, great vibe, great drink, great sounds, great foodIf you want to \"hire\" specific outside space they charge \u00a31000 as a minimum spend for a group of 12 or more.

    "text": "Madison has some clear pros and cons, though I'd give it four stars just for its unique pros. First, if you work in the Bank area, the location is perfect. In my case, this place is about 10min walk away from my office which makes it an ideal after-work venue for any purpose. Second, the view of St Paul's is one of a kind. Depending on the time of the day, you'll get different experiences too, so try to be there for a couple hours to see the full spectrum of the views this place can offer. However, a clear downside is the difficulty of getting in at peak times. For example, only two elevators operate up and down the building, and there can be a huge queue to even get on the lift to get to the bar. Once at the bar, you then have to go on a quest to find a spot to stand and drink amidst a heavy crowd. The drinks are good, though can be considered pricey. I liked their finger foods last time I tried. Finally, the indoors venue is quite well-done -- might be worth trying to get a table next time for a private party.",

The bar is quite expensive however, it costs around 10 pounds for a cocktail, and the line for the bar was fairly long but went kind of quick. There are areas to sit with laid back music to the left of the elevator. Go look at the view of The City before you grab a drink, since you can't bring your drink along with you on the main part of the rooftop.",
