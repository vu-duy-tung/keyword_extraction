The best pork dumpling I've ever had anywhere and I'm Thai! The lady owner is very friendly and sincerely lovely and generous. Her husband had passed away a week ago, unfortunately. The decor aren't great, which is a shame as she could attract more customers otherwise. But the quality of food compensated for that once you are inside and eating! Since I moved out of London, I came here for a meal every time I come to London.",

The food was delicious and inexpensive. Plus, we saved money bringing out own beer with no corking fee! I got the prawn pad thai and hubs got chicken pad thai. Both were great.My only complaint (which, really, I could have voiced at the time but didn't) was that my pad thai (1 of 3 we ordered) was much smaller than the orders given to my dining partners. Not sure if that's just because I'm a small woman or if it was an accident. (When I used to live in Guatemala, my portion sizes when I ate out would frequently be \"sized to fit\" my tiny frame. Unfortunately for me, I eat a lot more than one would expect for my wee-ness!) Luckily, my fianc\u00e9 had already eaten before we went out so I was able to finish his equally yummy dish.",

AMAZING. humongous portions, and their food was so so good. i went to SOAS for my third year of undergraduate and lived at dinwiddy house. we used to frequent paolina's and sit in their downstairs room w/ the tables that were too close together at least once a week. ok so here's the thing -- the food was good but the ambience wasn't even close by a longshot. and service was always so slow. however, they were SUPER friendly and it was really close to our school. so we returned frequently. \u00a0paolina's is the type of place you go to all the time with your best friends because it's close to your heart. because it's got comfort food. because they always make you feel welcome and smile big and you leave full and happy. \u00a0you don't really notice the stained linens or cramped bathroom (which you sortof have to climb your way into) or the fact that your table is pretty much touching the table next to it. you sortof just gloss over all these things. because paolina's is the type of place you can make your own \"spot\". \u00a0and who doesn't love having a restaurant to call their own spot.",

That doesn't mean that the quality of the food is compromised - far from it. I have eaten there countless times and the food has always been magnificent - the green curry is hot and spicy, the starters fantastic, and it is very reasonably priced. Add to that the fact that you have to bring your wine/beer etc, it makes an excellent alternative to fast food when you are on a night out.

I was hungry and was so glad we had everything we ordered. The place and service: it's definitely a hole in the wall, mom and pop shop kinda place. But you know that means a cozy, casual atmosphere.

The restaurant itself was downstairs and incredibly small and cosy with its medium oak walls and tables. \u00a0Service was exquisite and staff were of all genders and ages like a family run restaurant. Upon entering I saw the elders preparing the rice and some carrying heavy loads of dirty dishes downstairs to wash. It was like I stepped out of Kings Cross for a little bit and into a Thai family's home.Deep fried tofu This came piping hot, freshly fried so still kept it's lovely silky melting texture inside which balanced well with the thin crispy exterior sides. The peanut sauce was lovely and thick to cling on to the tofu adding a lovely rounded nutty sweetness to it. Tom KhaA coconut based milk soup with galangal and kaffir lime leaves was very fragrant with warming notes of spice. It was filled generously with lovely fresh and plump prawns and mushrooms.Thai green curry chickenThis was a lovely addition of the classic dish. It was thick, creamy, complex flavours with all the traditional ingredients of aubergine, bamboo shoots, galangal and more. The chicken was a bit thinly cut but was still very tender. Portion was very small too but quality made up for it.Kang massaman beef This was one of the best varieties we've had being really thick, savoury, rich in flavour with complexity. Unlike some we've had before it wasn't overly sweetened. The carrots and potatoeswere both fork tender and the beef came chunky and soft too. Cashews provided a lovely sweet nutty finish as well as a contrast to the softer textures.Lard na This was also surprisingly good. I somewhat didn't expect fresh Ho fun in a place like this. It was cooked perfectly, slippery, full of bounce and in a lovely soy based gravy seasoned perfectly. It was better than more than half of the restaurants in Chinatown serving Ho fun. They were generous with the prawns and squid which were both tender and plump. Vegetables were fresh and sweet too.Coconut custard & Sweet Sticky rice This has become Ren's favourite dessert. The custard pudding was like an egg flan, subtle in sweetness with a layer of sliced pumpkins for a more diverse experience. The sticky rice had the most comforting texture being chewy and al dente. The slight saltiness to it against the custard was like maple syrup to bacon being the perfect match and balance whilst the condensed milk made everything creamier and sweetMango and sweet sticky rice This was delicious and without fault. The sticky rice was slightly salty drizzled over with condensed milk to add a layer of creaminess as well as sweetness. The mango was sweet and juicy provided the perfect contrast to balance not only the salt but the density of the dish too. Truly delicious.I love this little cafe so much. Blended amongst other buildings along King's Cross Road it almost feel like a hidden gem. There's no fanciness to it, just all the classic Thai dishes cooked homely, with passion and at reasonable prices. Can't wait to return.",

    "text": "I'm slightly disappointed by Paolina's Thai Cafe. I got takeaway, and while the food itself wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't memorable. Also the portion size was shockingly small, so I came away still a bit hungry. Perhaps I would've gotten more if I had sat in instead of taking it away? However, the most egregious part of the meal was actually when it was being prepared. The kitchen lies exposed to the customers, and it makes for a pretty neat scene while you wait for your food. The one chef that was preparing my food seemed friendly and knowledgeable enough, and my food came out rather quickly. When he was packing my food, he started to make another customer's dish. AT THIS MOMENT, he decided to PICK HIS NOSE, wipe it on his apron, and continued cooking without sanitizing his fingers. I was disgusted and almost had a mind to throw away my food, out of fear that he might have done it earlier without me watching.That one moment has probably turned me off this place for good. Rather disturbing display of the sanitary conditions, or lack thereof, in this one-man kitchen.",

    "text": "So came back here with a larger group (7) the week after I wrote my glowing review. Sadly I feel as though I have to knock it down to three stars, especially if there are more than 4 of you and it's a Saturday. Our issue: we ordered starter platters for sharing and when the food came to our table the waitress said we've had to change some of the food as we've run out. This meant that 4 people in the group couldn't eat 80% of it. I completely understand that these things happen but it's not acceptable to tell people as you serve it. We would have been happy to order something else but by this point it was too late because we had already ordered mains. The mains came and again chicken had been swapped for beef in two cases, luckily this wasn't a dietary issue. At the end the staff had forgotten to include some items on the bill and then asked us for it after we paid. These things happen but I no longer feel as though it deserves 5/5. Will definitely be returning on a quieter evening with 1/2 other people.",

I feel bad for the grandma carrying a huge heavy tray of dishes down the stairs by herself, I really wanted to help her but it was back of house and she was smiling so figured she could handle it.The atmosphere kind of reminded me of Thailand somewhat only 30\u00b0 colder.It's warm welcoming staff and casual seating made you feel at home.The food was a bit hit and miss, the masammam curry was homely and comforting. The Tom Ka also hit the spot and tasted better than an instant soup which is my usual Thai restaurant experience.Many other dishes were generic english 'thai' food that you don't really get in Thailand except for the tourist spots but saying that, the quality was pretty good, nothing was bad so far.The desserts really shone, I can't speak for the authenticity as I rarely ate dessert in Thailand. One in particular, the coconut custard and sweet sticky rice. This dish was one of the best desserts I've ever had. It wasn't exactly complex or fancy, just a simple creamy rice dish but made me feel like a 4 year old Thai kid being treated to home made desert after getting a gold star at school :(Don't come here expecting a gourmet experience, come here expecting to feel at home and welcome, the prices are not too bad but be careful as it can get pretty busy at peak times.",

Delicious thai food freshly cooked right next to you in the store. This place deserves more rave and praise! Don't get put off by the small store front, say hello to a few step down and a few bigger long tables! All their noodle dishes are well made with affordable pricing. Not the cheapest thai, but for what you get, and its portions, it's not a bad deal. Also once saw a group celebrating a birthday dinner here, so, there you go. It is big enough to cater more than 10+ people!Do try their thai ice tea! Yum!",

Didn't disappoint. It just *feels* thai. The food was delicious \u00a0and service didn't complain about our million substitutes.

It ain't a chain so don't expect a fancy decor however, it great to grab a quick bite (something after work maybe). There is a inner and outer searing area, inner can cater for a group of 6 max. seated together, more can do but not ideal, although the place can hold about 30 people in total. They don't except reservations neither do they do delivery's (but yes do have takeaway).If you are unsure what to order - spicy, mild, sweet and sour), do ask as they provide personalised suggestions (which is great). All the meat/seafood dishes availabke can be made in Vegetarian.Last tip, get some cash before popping in to avoid rush for cash machine after a good meal (since they don't accept cards).",

I come here at least three times a week.The green curry with vegetables is excellent, and the pad thai with prawns is alright.I also appreciate that the restaurant has an open kitchen, which I'm always a fan of because I'm a real stickler for cleanliness and open kitchens make me feel that the restaurant has nothing to hide.Tip: this place is cash only.",
