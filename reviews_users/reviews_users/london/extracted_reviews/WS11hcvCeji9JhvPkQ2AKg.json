    "text": "This place is always packed to the rafters whenever I walk past so one day we thought we'd give it a try, but we were so disappointed. A good crepe should be delicate, light and melt-in-the-mouth, but at Caf\u00e9 Cr\u00eaperie they're huge, crispy, folded over monster pancakes, browning on the outside rather than a nice golden yellow. I was surprised at this as the chefs were French, the waitresses were French... so why weren't the crepe? The huge choice of fillings, both savory and sweet are tasty, I had Tortiflette, a traditional bacon, potato, raclette cheese, onion, white wine and cream filled one, but the whole crepe was far too heavy and none of us particularly enjoyed the result. The small selection of wines are OK, all are fairly inoffensive so they don't impede the already strong flavour of the crepe.I really didn't like the interior either, it's a cheap caff style, with throw away table clothes and a constant queue of people who they let loiter about in the door way waiting for a table, which is rather off putting as it's only a small restaurant and when I was there they were actually standing next to the tables. Plus because of \u00a0the door constantly opening and closing there actually flies buzzing around! The music is from a radio at the back and if your sat further in it's so awful to be subjected to it blaring out. As the kitchen is a small counter in the dining area you come out smelling like an over done crepe yourself! The waitresses are also rude and it lacks any Parisian charm whatsoever.I can't understand why people rave about this place! For me, it's getting nuls points.",

Once I tried the Italian crape, I was hooked! This delight contains mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, basil and a special Italian sauce.They also have wonderful sweet crapes too! For example, you can find specials like cream cheese and strawberry preserves, or just apple, cinnamon and raisin. All of the recipes",

Service too, can be slightly chaotic on the busy days when queues can snake out the door.But thats a good sign too, right?Once you get in, try the real Breton cider - strong, rich, dark and delicously different to the sweet fizzy commercial and the flat dry Somerset versions. Among the crepes, there is a bewilderingly vast choice on the menu, as well as daily specials up on the boards. The one I usually end up going for is the Buckwheat Gallette with champignon (creamy mushrooms), cheese and ham. There are plenty of choices for vegetarians, but coeliacs, dairy-free and vegans might have more trouble.",

The selection of savoury crepes was a unique and curious lot with an international flair to fit any taste! I had the chicken and mushroom but not just any chicken and mushroom...a pepper cheese and cream with garlic infusion made this a party for the taste buds. After we had our crepes and washed down with a very nice crisp sav. blanc for \u00a313.50 a bottle, we went onto the homemade ice cream and the sweet crepes! The toffee, banana, coconut crepe was a flavour sensation. Good news too...they are opening a new creperie on Dean street in Soho tomorrow or Tuesday! HUZZAH! The staff are friendly and attentive and really were thankful for our custom which they will get many more times!",

I have to stop converting prices into USD, but in any case, the price range of their crepes was between \u00a36.00 and \u00a310.00 (at least for the savory ones). I tried the spicy tandoori chicken crepe (\u00a37.75), which was fun to eat. (What can I say? I like trying foods that are familiar to me except in an unfamiliar form.) There was also some courgette (i.e., zucchini, if you're an American) mixed in there. I tasted some of the chicken mushroom crepe (\u00a37.95) and the chicken and pepperoni crepe (\u00a37.95), both of which were tasty, but I think you have to be open-minded about your crepe tasting like a pizza for the latter one.The verdict: I must return after an outing to V&A or Hyde Park and try a sweet crepe.",

    "text": "I would highly recommend those wondering what to order to look up at the \"Crepe Specials\" board before ordering because a) They don't have it on their original menu (which has so many options you'll get dizzy just looking at it) & you never know when they'll stop making their scrumptious limited time specials!b) The sweet & savoury crepes I tried tonight from the Special Crepe board were both delicious.The server wasn't able to understand/speak English too fluently so it took a while to order, but I still had a great experience. Popeye - Savoury Crepe: juicy (yes juicy! Not dry!) chicken pieces, spinach (hence the name), goat cheese (I substituted mine with brie b/c I'm no fan of goat cheese), cheddar cheese & sundried tomatoes. The cheeses were perfectly melted, the ingredients complimented each other well and it was neither too salty/bland. Mmm... The spinach didn't leave that weird residue-ey feeling that some spinach/cheese crepes do back in the states! Strawberry Cheesecake - Sweet Crepe: Get it. You're daft to not get it if you like sweets, strawberries, cheesecake, belgian white chocolate, crumbled sweet biscuit and vanilla ice cream... or anything of the sort. So good. Blew all my stress away.It's a bit cramped inside, but there's seating outside if you don't mind the weather!Highly recommend this place if you want delicious crepes for a decent price.",

I wasnt expecting too much really for a restaurant like this which is so close to V&A and all the other museums. I ordered the english breakfast crepe and it was okay. I will say if i ever come to this area again in a super early morning i will choose to come here.",

This restaurant is crowded with tables and chairs, but smells great...probably because it serves fresh crepes and gelato. I ordered a hazelnut crepe and my husband ordered a chocolate and banana crepe. They were served warm and gooey, with melted chocolate inside. VERY rich and decadent, but also really good!I also ordered a cappuccino, which was delicious with the rich dessert. The atmosphere is crowded and nothing special, but I thought the food, as a treat, was great.",

I ordered both the caramel banana crepes and chocolate Belgian waffles with a side scoop of snickers ice cream and ferrer rocher. To cut a tasty mouth explosion short the waffle was fantastic. Moist, chocolate melting muddy, fresh and fluffy and delicious to boot ... Oh both of the scoops of ice cream hit the mark as well. Yet .... On the flip the crepes not so much. Dry and disappointing to put it bluntly. I was eying of the freshness of the girls sitting next to me and wished I was in her shoes and not mine.

After sitting down I realised why - \u00a0what used to be 4 or 5 pages menu full of great and varied crepes turned into one page menu with a mere 8 savory crepes on the list (and three specials on the board). We were hesitant but finally decided to stay to check whether at least the quality is still there. Unfortunately, the crepe I ordered was mediocre. I also asked the waitress why the menu has been downgraded to a single page and she only explained that they have a new owner and that is what he wishes to have.It is really a pity that what used to be one of my favourite restaurants in London with great menu and selection of fantastic crepes turned into an average place.

As of last night, I had officially arrived, hungry for something sweet with a gluttonous appetite and a crowd of dessert-fiend friends.This sweet little spot (see what I did there?) is very close to South Kensington station and Imperial College. We jumped at the chance to go after eating at Pierino (very close by). We arrived shortly before closing and were seated quickly and given menus. They have everything. EVERYTHING. Tons of sweet and savoury crepes, a large selection of waffles and ice creams (ice cream sundaes of all shapes and sizes, too). All you need to do is merely look at the menu (go on, it will take you a while) and you'll find just what you're looking for, whether you want a classic crepe with nutella or you want a waffle smothered in tropical fruits or you just want something savoury and warm to get you through the day. If you're a vegetarian, you will be in luck, too - there are plenty of choices and you won't struggle much unless you can't decide from the options in front of you. Best of luck with that!We ordered everything from waffles covered in nuts, chocolate and served with Ferrero Rocher ice cream (yumyumyum!) to crepes with chocolate, sugar and lemon, to custom made crepes with drunken apples, cinnamon and chocolate to classic glass bowls crammed with flavor after flavor of ice cream. Everything came quickly so we were able to dig in and soothe our cravings before things got too out of hand. The only gripe I have about this place is if you're asking about the ice cream flavors, you have to get up and figure it out yourself as they've got dozens (try the Snickers ice cream, too) and they're not all listed on the menu and your server isn't going to want to walk you through them all. Portions are big enough to share but you won't want to - everything is too good to spare a bite.",

Last time it was about confusion as to whether I wanted take-away or eat-in when I made my desire to take away very, very clear.

    "text": "This was a disappointment, I am sorry to say. Even if I ordered a crep\u00e9s with buckwheat i didn't expect it to be dry, hard and tasteless. For that high a price I would expect to be amazed. And I was, by the lack of fresh fruits and that soft feeling you get in your soul when eating a really good crepes.Take a strawl down Porto Bello Road when theres a market and you'll find 5-6 different street venders with crepes five times as good at a third of the price.The place was loud and the staff seemed so busy trying to serve everyone (or what they were doing) that i felt like being in the middle of Indy 500 race track. A couple of shattered glassed I think shows the stress levels these guys were under. Not their fault, not at all. It all comes down to management and leadership.If I was the only one in the company with a bad experience, that'd be fine, but my girlfriend didn't seem to enjoy her crep\u00e9s either. And the fact that they handed us our check right after we finished, without asking for it. Like: Please leave.Sorry guys. Do over, do better. They're in a great spot on a nice street and it could become a good place. With some effort.",

    "text": "This place is in a great location on a stretch of Exhibition Road a couple of blocks south of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The food and coffee are both great and the outdoor seating is wonderful on a nice day. The prices are also reasonable. The table service is pretty good and the personnel are quite friendly and pleasant. However, our experience suggested the kitchen staff might be overwhelmed a little too easily when things get busy.We had just finished our tour of the Victoria and Albert Museum. It was about 3:30 and we had not had lunch. We saw from TripAdvisor that there were several restaurants two blocks away on a short stretch of Exhibition Road that was largely dominated by pedestrian traffic. There were a number of excellent choices but this place stood out with an attractive exterior and a tantalizing specialty for its cuisine. The outdoor seating area was packed as It was surprisingly busy for the time of day but we chalked this up to the fact that it was a Bank Holiday. We were fortunate in our timing as there was only one other party ahead of us waiting to be seated. That group was larger and wanted to sit inside. Hence, when an outside table became available, we were seated within a minute or two of our arrival. We observed that seating became more difficult during the course of our visit.Our server waited on us right away. She appeared to be one of the proprietors and was rather pleasant and very friendly. The staff were flying around frantically at times trying to take care of the numerous patrons. In all they were doing a pretty decent job in a challenging situation even if they seemed slightly disorganized at times.We placed our order and received our Sparkling Water very quickly followed by the crepe ordered by my colleague in a very reasonable amount of time. However, when they delivered the first crepe, I was told the crepe I ordered was coming. Unfortunately, after fifteen minutes or so it had still not arrived. At this time, our server came back and asked how we had enjoyed our food. I let her know I was still waiting on my crepe. She offered a sincere apology and a menacing scowl came across her face as she looked back toward the kitchen. She went back inside to have a word with someone and my crepe appeared about three or four minutes later. I appreciated the quick rectification but it was clear to me that things had reached a tipping point for them and the helter-skelter was getting the best of them.As far as the food was concerned, however, we could not have been happier with our selections once they were delivered. At the recommendation of our server, my colleague selected the La Belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, a sweet crepe featuring a pear, dark Belgian chocolate, almond flakes, vanilla ice cream and real whipped cream. She let me try it and it was absolutely luscious. I chose a savory crepe on the other hand deciding to try the Countryside, which was filled with chicken, onion, spinach, garlic, carrot and cheddar cheese. It was likewise excellent and was also quite filling. We finished with coffees which were done very nicely.The prices were not bad for what we received and considering it was centre city London. The total bill was \u00a329.48, everything included. This was about $46 USD at the exchange rate at the time, or about $23 per person. In an expensive city like London, this sort of pricing was not unexpected. And we certainly got our money's worth considering the quality of the fare.Overall, while there were some hiccups in service due to the busyness at the time we were there, this place was a great find. The crepes and coffee both were excellent, the personnel were polite and pleasant and the atmosphere was lovely. The prices were not bad considering the location and the quality of the fare. If you like crepes and outdoor cafes, this is a great choice.",

I think the beef ragu is my favourite as it's not a flavour I have found elsewhere and it is really yummy, but the Countryside with chicken,garlic and spinach and added potatoes was also great. The menu has a lot of great options and you can choose your own fillings which is great. I really love the iced coffee latte here as well. The KC hot chocolate is maybe too laced with cinnamon flavour for me, but it was nice. I definitely plan to come back sometime to try the dessert menu!",

    "text": "Next to South Kensington station and very close to Hyde Park in London, this is a lovely place to eat delicious crepes. Given you can get a delicious meal for \u00a39, as long as you earn in pounds, you can call that a bargain. It is a well served crepe portion and the only downside I would mention about this place is the fact that it only accepts cash. These days when you can pay virtually anything with a card, I find a bit nonsense that you cannot do it in a restaurant. They also have lovely options for desert. I highly recommend this play but I also suggest to avoid lunch hours, since that's when you get the peaks of visitors and you may end up facing a very long queue in order to manage to get a table.",

    "text": "I had a smoked salmon and spinach crepe, or rather, what I thought was a crepe.I should have trusted my instincts the moment I walked into the dingy place and saw the cook make a crepe on the crepe pan with an **incredible** amount of oil.My crepe arrived rather greasy and very crispy, which of course is a product of having it FRIED in grease. Crepes are meant to be slightly chewy and delicate but this was none of that. I would say calling it a crepe is a wee bit of a misnomer. More like a very fried thin pancake with filling.The smoked salmon and spinach had cheese inside which made it a little salty. I was starving but didn't finish my \"crepe\".They have a very wide selection of sweet and savory crepes. It is better in my opinion to be master of a few crepes than to be a jack of all crepes. Come here if you are easily satisfied. Otherwise, avoid this place. My \"crepe\" cost 8.5 quid.",

    "text": "Very very thick crepes. We came here for a Saturday morning breakfast. My husband had a chicken pesto crepe. Chicken quality was horrible and it smelled and was too big. I had the hazel bania crepe of something. Was good but the crepe was so thick and layered. Had never seen that before. Color also seemed off. Latte was extremely cold. Have never had a latte that cold between our Paris and London trip. Will look else where as the prices were a bit much. We paid around 30-35 pounds for a breakfast of two for tw crepes and tw drinks",
