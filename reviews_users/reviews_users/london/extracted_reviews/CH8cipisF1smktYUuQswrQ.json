Given the raving reviews on yelp, this seemed a sure choice and didn't fall short of my expectation. The decor inside is warm and inviting, and customer service was second to none. The food was served hot and within an excellent time frame, was delicious, fresh and excellent value for money. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area looking for something a little set back from the hustle and bustle of Leicester Square, who has a taste for contemporary Pakistani cuisine yet without having to bust the bank! My date was extremely impressed with my choice, who has agreed to see me again. Thanks to salt 'n' pepper for making it an evening to be remembered, and to yelp for providing this service. Thank you",

The service was wonderful and the manager, Mr. Sharma stopped by my table and we had a very nice chat. I will definitely be back again next time I'm visiting as both the Royal Trafalgar and Salt 'n Pepper were winners.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner last night after a comedy show. We were looking for restaurants in the Covent garden/Leicester square area with an offer on, which seemed like an unlikely task. However, this place was on tablepouncer and opentable with a 50% offer which is pretty damn good for central (we booked with opentable because tablepouncer charges a \u00a35 booking fee for the same offer - just as an FYI). We booked for 8.45 and there was only one other party in there. We were told that for the 50% off you had to order a starter and a main each, but that suited us down to the ground. We ordered the amb somosas and the shami kebabs for starter and chicken tikka masala and korma for mains. I found all of it very spicy, especially the starters and the masala. I thought I'd be safe with a korma as they're meant for wimps right? But this one was still pretty spicy. We also got 2x rice and a naan with a beer and a coke and the whole thing came to \u00a338 which is a steal (it would have been \u00a365).The staff were okay but our waiter had the voice of a mouse and seemed to whisper everything. I see why they run this offer, because the restaurant is on a back street off Leicester square so you would only find it if you know about it. However, I would recommend giving it a go, only if you have the offer.",

Ordered lamb chops but unfortunately got lamb shish kebab instead. \u00a0This was disappointing because we wanted meaty pieces, not lamb-burger. \u00a0The kebabs were overly spiced to the point of obliterating the lamb flavor. I didn't complain as our time was short. \u00a0Bottle of house red wine was fair - nothing special but ok for price. Decor was simple and sparse. \u00a0Bottom line: decent enough place for a pre-theater meal but definitely not a destination restaurant. Not worth a second visit.",

    "text": "We came to this place by recommendation of some locals. There were so many strikes against this meal that under any other circumstances, it would have been a disaster. For example, I love Southern Indian cuisine but this place is Northern Indian/Pakistani. Though I've never had Pakistani food before this, Northern Indian has failed to impress me in the past. I also don't eat meat and their menu is mainly meat dishes. When I did eat meat, chicken was my least favorite and we ordered chicken for my son. Lastly, I've never been a fan of Daal... read on...By the time I realized this place is Pakistani/Northern Indian it was too late, we had already ordered drinks and appetizers. I also had a huge lunch and wasn't hungry but was forced to come to dinner as my wife was starving. So I was now prepared for a disappointing meal. As we were waiting for our food, the staff was extremely friendly and came to play with my son (even taking him for a walk around the restaurant in the beginning). Our waiter was very knowledgable and recommended individual courses that worked together to create a well rounded meal. When the food arrived, I braced myself and took a bite of the Paneer Tika Masala. It was like butter. The flavor was heavenly and I couldn't wait to try the next dish, the Prawn Karahi. It was perfection. The flavor was multi dimensioned... it was, as my wife would describe as \"a party in your mouth!\"As mentioned earlier, Daal isn't my favorite but Taji wanted to try it anyway. But the Daal Channa here was the best I've ever had. The biggest surprise of the night was the Tandoori Chicken which we ordered for my son. My wife raved about it and asked me to take a bite. As mentioned earlier, I don't eat meat and when I did, my least favorite was chicken. But one bite led to another, and soon I ate the entire piece. Each bite was filled with flavor completely through the chicken. Simply delicious. \u00a0We also ordered Onion and Garlic Naan as well as Chili and Coriander Naan, both were outstanding. I began this meal with so many strikes against it and left beyond impressed. This has been the best meal we've had so far on this trip and ranks as one of our all time favorite meals. We will but putting Salt and Pepper on our list of must eat places whenever we return to London.",

This is only my second foray into Indian food in London, and I was left somewhat disappointed again.There is an interesting plaque on the wall that said something like, we only use British produce, organic foods (or something like that), but curiously the last line said \"We use fewer spices, in fewer quantities\" - but why? Indian food is the king when it comes to using a variety of spices, and I think that what makes it quite good. I don't want my Indian food to be bland!I thought the potato samosa tasted a bit flat and dry. The korma chicken was the biggest disappointment. Usually in the States korma is like orange or brown. This one was almost a nude color, which is really odd for Indian food. The sauce was not that flavorful. The spinach dishes we got were okay. They sadly did not have palak paneer, so we got something close but it was not quite right. My friend said the paneer didn't taste that great. I thought the spinach portion itself was decent. One of the spinach dishes was unusually spicy, so spicy that I started crying.The mango lassi was very delicious though.It could be that I'm just ignorant when it comes to British Indian food, but I thought this place was just okay. They could up the flavors a bit more here.",

I am a bit of a snob about Pakistani food and have a hard time finding Pakistani/Indian food in London that I think is worth paying for. I know someone who is a fan of the Salt n' Pepper branch in Lahore and pointed me to the London location and I am so glad they did! The lamb seekh kabobs were piping hot and very good and the chappli kabobs were great. I really enjoyed the \u00a0tasty spices and flavouring of the karahi chicken, and I was very happy to wipe up every last bit of sauce with the excellent roghni naan. I have tried the saag aloo and the zeera aloo, both of which were nice although not as exciting as the karahi chicken. I think the saag aloo wins over the zeera aloo because of the edge the fenugreek gave it.The service here is very helpful and quick and the restaurant itself is spacious and clean. The food is not too cheap and the portions are not large, but considering this is Leicester Square, I think it is decent value. I am definitely coming back here as the menu has so much more I'd like to try and I want to see what the talented chef does with it!",

At the moment, it's in the middle of all the construction around Leicester Square - which now seems like a really quiet street.We ordered the lamb samosas, lamb chops and lamb seehk kebabes as starters - all which came out amazing. \u00a0Comparing it to Tayyabs - pretty good! \u00a0Actually prefer some of the dishes here. \u00a0Felt a lot more fresh with more herbs and spices.For our mains, we had the chicken tikka, lamb rogan josh, and the chicken biryani along with an sorted bread basket. \u00a0When all of the food came out, at first I thought the portions looked quite small but we were so stuffed we asked to take what was left to go. \u00a0So happy to find this place - will definitely be back!",

I thought it was only mediocre. \u00a0They had a neat selection of beers which I liked. One drawback was the smoking on the front patio it was epic and the stink was terrible. Why do people want to kill themselves with this poison?But the chicken do pyaza and the chicken Karachi now they are both on point and really tasty. I'd eat either one of them all day. This is where the restaurant earns its money and they got the most crucial thing right. Service not great though the waitress did a good job keeping up though she was overworked. This ain't Tayyabs but is still serviceable. I'd go back for sure.",
