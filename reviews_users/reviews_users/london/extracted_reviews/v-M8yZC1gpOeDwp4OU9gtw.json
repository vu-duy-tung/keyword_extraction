    "text": "Tas offers an exciting cuisine of Turkish origin. On their website they describe their restaurants as offering a fine dining experience and the highest quality food. This is a tall order to live up to and to be honest I would not expect \"the highest quality food\" from a restaurant that makes such a claim, but I figured I would be fair and go in with an unbiased opinion and give Tas the opportunity to prove itself.My first impressions of the restaurant as I entered were positive. The restaurant was open and airy, providing a pleasant view of the London streets just outside. The mood was inviting and pleasant without seaming cheap or informal and the music and lighting complemented the atmosphere.Because we had booked for the large group we ordered off a prepared menu and already had a portion of the meal predetermined. The starters came out in a relatively timely manner and I must say that the array of food was impressive. The starters included Borek, Humus, Manca, Tabule, Sebzeli Kofte, Zeytin Yagli Bakla, and Zeytin Yagli Patlican and were all excellent. In particular the Manca (a sort of tart yogurt and spinach mix) offered a refreshing yet zingy flavor and was exceptional with the traditional bread served with the starters. As a whole the starters offered an exciting mix of traditional flavors and I would suggest any of them.For my main course I ordered calamari. I was hoping for an exciting dish filled with interesting flavors that would compliment the squid. Unfortunately my meal was not all that I had hoped it to be. The flavors were bland and it was served only with an equally bland walnut paste. This is not to say that the calamari wasn't good, it just wasn't as exciting as I had hoped and I wish that I had chosen a more exotic dish. My friends Karides Guvech was exceptional and offered a full gamut of flavors, I would recommend this dish to anybody looking for a good meal.To complement the meal our teacher graciously agreed to pay for a couple bottles of wine and we enjoyed both of the house wines, a Turkish white and red wine. The house red would best be described as blunt and had an almost shockingly strong bitterness to it. However, this lessened as the wine breathed and by the end of our meal was quite fruity and flavorful. The white had a mild flavor and was quite smooth. Neither would be my first choice if I went again.On the whole I would describe the restaurant as good and I would most certainly eat here again. However, I would highly suggest to indulge in the more exotic sounding dishes as these will provide a more exciting meal. The service was a bit over zealous although our large group size could well have been a factor. I will return to this restaurant on different terms in the future and I suggest that you do the same if you are looking for a meal that will be sure to excite.",

The meal started with a selection of great appetizers- spanakopita, baba ghanoush, hummus, and some other things I can't quite remember. Though my calamari was a little dry, it was still tasty. And the baklava and was great for dessert. I didn't have anything alcoholic to drink, but the fruit juices and cappuccino were both really good.",

    "text": "Not having been able to find \"sit down\" Turkish food closer than this, we made the trek along the M4/A4 from Windsor to Bloomsbury. TomTom did its best to misdirect me, but we finally made it to the general area and thanks to my mum's disabled badge we found easy parking. Note to other drivers: most parking around there is resident's. It was after 6pm, so no congestion charge and free parking. Does it get better?On to the restaurant... Perhaps they've redecorated since the first review, but the place looks nice: bright, airy and busy. What recession? The place was packed. They have additional seating downstairs (which are where the toilets are). Note for the mobility impaired, there seems to be stairs only access to the downstairs, though perhaps there's a lift hidden away for staff use (or a dumb waiter?)The menu is extensive and has a great assortment of items. We had three appetizers: dolmas (lovely and fresh), cacik (good but not great) and something with broad beans. Turkish bread with a yoghurt dip and marinated olives come with the table. The dip was actually tastier than my cacik appetizer, so next time I'll just keep asking for more dip. The olives should come in a steady stream throughout the meal - they are delicious with chili flakes to liven them up. You get four at a time and we went through two servings. I was gutted when a momentary distraction made me miss out on the last one before it disappeared when the plates were cleared!We had four entrees and split them: a mixed grill (kofte, lamb and chicken kebabs), shish taouk (chicken kebab) and an okra-based vegetarian dish. All entress are served with couscous, which I find odd because it is a North African rather than a Turkish staple as far as I am aware. But who cares because it is delicious and rich: flavourful, oily and just plain yummy. They could bring me more of that all night but they don't need to because the little bowl fills me right up.My kebabs were delicious and then there's the hot sauce. Now, I consider myself to be a hot sauce expert and no hot sauce scares me *chest thump*. This stuff is amazing. It is freshly made and is both spicy and refreshing at the same time. Full of green chili goodness.On to desert. I stayed traditional and had the baklava. My mum had \u00a0 Kaymakli Kestane - a chestnut based dish - and my mum's friend had Kayisi Tatlisi, which are dried apricots with nuts and cream on top. The last two were good (and the presentation was superb). My baklava was the best I've ever had (and as with the hot sauce, I haven't met a baklava I didn't enjoy). I got three small ones. They were moist, flaky and nutty, superbly rich and best of all, not tooth rottingly sweet and sticky!We had no alcohol, just water, soft drinks, espresso and Turkish coffee. The bill came to about \u00a377, which seems expensive to me coming from the United States but is probably good value for London.Service was efficient but a little brisk. The waitress did a double take when I asked for a box for the leftovers (because we had enough for a one person meal), but it is possible so ask! There's a recession on you know.",

Since then I have been many times and since I am not a vegetarian anymore, I quite enjoy their mixed grill. Excellent quality meats.The wine list is impressive, I like the Kleine Zalze, which is reasonably priced and delicious. The bread is so good you do not want to stop eating it, and the desert is delicious. Try to sundried apricots with homemade cream, or the homemade pistachio icecream. You will be in heaven!Reservations are a must, especially on weekends.Great place, great atmosphere and busy!",

I attended Tas for class, so my menu was already set. \u00a0I really enjoyed all the different starters that they provided. \u00a0The starters consisted of Humus, Zeytin Yagli Patlican (aubergine, tomatoes, garlic, peppers and chickpeas cooked in olive oil), Tabule (chopped parsley salad with tomatoes, onions, cracked wheat, olive oil and lemon juice), Manca (spinach with fresh yogurt served with garlic), Zeytin Yagli Bakla (fresh broad beans, coriander, red & green peppers, dill, garlic, olive oil served with yogurt), Sebzeli Kofte (ground chickpeas and broad beans tossed in spices, deep fried and served with tahini sauce), and Borek (filo pastry filled with feta cheese and spinach). \u00a0They were nicely displayed as well as quite tasty. \u00a0I liked the humus the best. \u00a0The Manca starter surprised me because it had a mint taste, but it was good. \u00a0For the main course, there were several choices, Karides Guvech, Kalamari, Turlu, Ispanakli Patates, Karisik Izgara, Mousakka, Tavuk Sis, Eksili Kofte, and Tavuk Guvech. \u00a0I chose the Karides Guvech which was prawns cooked with garlic, tomatoes and mushroom. \u00a0It was delicious, I ate it with white rice which balanced the sour, tart taste of the sauce. \u00a0Along with the food we had a choice of the house wines. \u00a0I'm not a big fan of wine in general, but the white and red wine were not too bad. \u00a0Overall I enjoyed the food, however I wasn't too thrilled with the waiter for our table. \u00a0In general, it's not good for a waiter to reach across someone's face to place things on the table or to rearrange place settings, this happened several times throughout the dinner. \u00a0I didn't order sleeve with my dinner. \u00a0Despite the waiter, I enjoyed the food at Tas.",

Whilst inside is a bit of a strange contrast; pale yellow, blue and light wood, that all remind me of a seaside hotel breakfast room. They could do so much more with the interior but, apart from the dodgy decor discrepancy I have, the Turkish food is worth a visit. The menu is an extensive and well-priced choice. All hot and cold starters are under \u00a35 so it's good to get a meze selection between friends and try out a few different dishes. I really like the Borek (Filo pastry filled with feta cheese and spinach) and the Icli Kofte (Minced meat covered with cracked wheat and salad). Whilst all the mains are around the \u00a310 mark. The casseroles, which are cooked in a traditional Anatolian stew pot are very flavoursome, with tender meat and Eastern spices. These are especially great during the cold weather! Tas also has good value set menu's such as three courses for \u00a38.95 and a meze platter for \u00a310.95, although when I tried this the meze selection was slightly less tasty as when we'd ordered them separately. I give the food a thumbs up, especially as around fifty percent of the menu is vegetarian, but the cheesy decor looses Tas a few brownie points and it wouldn't be a choice for a special evening meal. We usually come for afternoon tea, although it is busier then as the Bloomsbury literati and tourists also like to pile in.",

The service was excellent and the waiter pointed out that the intended main course ordered by my wife was available as a 2 course option at the same price as the main course. We tried different starters and main courses on each visit and found all were very good. The wine was reasonably priced for any city we have visited. We would definitely eat here again when we visit London.",

My entree was full of flavor as was everyone else's at my table.While the meal was delicious, my wine was horrible!! I ordered a small glass of the house red and it had an unpleasant musky flavor.. not appealing at all.Our male Turkish waiter, who I first thought was Russian or French, was very attractive as was the woman that seated us. If everyone in Turkey looks like them I will be moving there ASAP!!!!Not my favorite meal ever but definitely worth a try for a new dining experience.",

    "text": "I went here with a group of other scholars after a conference at the University of London -- all people who have traveled a bit and are particular about their food. We were a group of about 15 people, and we were seated in the basement. The restaurant has a pleasant enough decor and seems very classy on the exterior and inside. We were informed that because we were a large group, we had to order off of the group menu, which was 18.50 per person... that was the first thing that annoyed me about the meal. I am a graduate student who has scrimped to fly 8 times zones away to a conference, so being informed that I MUST pay at least $30 for my meal, right up front, sort of made me angry. My colleagues offered me wine and I had to tell them that I couldn't afford any because the meal was too expensive. That was embarrassing. Fortunately, the senior colleagues were sweet and offered to buy wine for the students provided we didn't go crazy and drink a huge amount. With the group menu, the waiters bring you a selection of mezze and let you pick your own main dish. The mezze were all very good; I especially liked the eggplant salad and boerek, and the balls that resembled falafel and the hummus were very good, too. I was moderately fond of the fava beans with yogurt and the tabbouleh was average -- about what I expect from tabbouleh anywhere. The Turkish bread and olive oil/tahini dip were quite tasty. For my main, I ordered the spinach and potato vegetarian dish, which was cooked in soy sauce and veggie broth. The waiter added some chili paste at my request. They also offered herbed yogurt to our table to add to our dishes. I had a colleague who was gluten-intolerant, and the restaurant's chef made him a special mezze of his own, as he couldn't eat many of the other ones -- some sort of mushroom and vegetable dish. They also brought him chopped carrots and cucumbers to dip in the hummus. I thought that was nice of them. We all liked the food a lot.You may wonder why I am only giving the restaurant 1 star if I liked the food so much. Well, as many other reviewers have noted, the service was BAD. The waiter was unfriendly and brusque and appeared rarely. He left us without water for long periods of time. He would not give me more chili when I asked for some. I didn't enjoy that. I also didn't enjoy that I had to pay 25 for my meal once the service charge was added. That's $40! For $40, I expect amazing food, large portions, and polite, attentive service. I NEVER pay more than $25-$30 when I go out to eat at home (in Los Angeles) unless it's a very special occasion, and that is including a 20% tip. WHAT A RIP-OFF. Being FORCED to give a THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT TIP for what was actually ROTTEN SERVICE is an insult. I am given to understand that in the UK, you only tip if you got really great service, and then you only tip something like ten percent. So, why do they have the cheek to FORCE us to pay a 35% tip, especially when they give such terrible service? This is why I would encourage you, the diners of the world, NOT to visit Tas. Show them that we have other choices. The city of London is absolutely crawling with other options for delicious and fresh Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food. Go get some of that instead.",

The waiter needed to consult the manager for this and sadly the manager turned us down. \u00a0When we asked for boxes to go at the end we were informed that he was not allowed in the kitchen because it was closed. \u00a0When we asked for dessert which was included in our meal, we were informed for the second time that the kitchen had closed! \u00a0The manager had to be called. He in turn informed us that we ate too slowly and the cook had gone home and could not prepare the dessert we wanted. \u00a0Throughout this conversation he excused himself repeatedly to make phone calls to an invisible force behind the scenes who seemed to be remote controlling this turkish tragedy unfolding before us. Alas we were deprived of dessert. He did however adjust the bill to reflect this by charging for only one person at the end. \u00a0Food quality was so-so.",

    "text": "Since Tas is located directly across from the hotel I stayed at during my last London visit, a family member and I opted to eat here after we spent a very long day on the train and Tube alike. While we stopped in planning to not eat THAT much due to it being a little late, we quickly ended up ordering more than we expected simply due to the delicious nature of the menu! We ended up sampling soup, meatballs, and an okra and couscous dish I believe was called bamyan. The seafood soup with mushrooms and shrimp was delightful, and topped off with seasoning from the cilantro family. The meatballs were simply excellent: tender, juicy, covered in absolutely delicious sauce. And the okra was, for lack of a better word, delectable -ESPECIALLY with the yogurt and couscous that came with it. Even after all of that, though, we had to try the Turkish delight squares that came with the bill; they were a perfect sweet addition to a meal dominated by tomato- and citrus-based sauces.My only complaint about the experience was that I wished throughout the visit that they would either check on tables more or leave a pitcher of water, because my dining buddy and I were parched after our long day. But, we managed, and frankly, the food was so good, I got over that pretty quickly. Turkish food is hard to come by in my hometown, but now I can say I've been able to enjoy it - and that I would absolutely visit here again during future trips overseas.",

He literally pushed us out of the restaurant. What would a normal manager do? In most cases - nothing, just kindly smiling while showing you a way to a toilet. In some cases a manager might ask you to leave some tips for the cleaners but still with a smiling face. Hope that the manager of this restaurant will read this message and learn some lessons of politeness. Almost all negative reviews apply to rude staff. I've been here on 8 of November 2017.

Upon arrival the wait staff as rude. But Yelp loved this place so I overlooked it. When the soup came out cold and the salad came out mushy, I said nothing and smiled. When the bread and hummus came out stale, I smiled kindly. When the halibut came out, I nearly died from disgust. This dish was DISGUSTING. It was cold and had BONES all in it. Not only that, the fish was a frozen fillet! It wasn't even fresh. The taste was horrifying. When we tried calling the manager over, he not only didn't listen to me, he YELLED at me in front of the customers.

So this place seemed like a great idea.We had two last minute drop outs, and they easily adjusted our table to fit four instead of six. We chatted for a bit, and kind of decided what we wanted, but no server was to be found. Eventually Jules had to wave at one to get them to come over.I had the only cocktail on the menu and it was nice. I also tried the non-alcoholic drink consisting of picked carrots and beets with salt and spices mixed with yogurt. (Also tasty, but it was a bit intense). For food, I ordered the spiced lamb liver to start and the mixed grill in tomato sauce and bread for a main. The liver was fantastic. Really tasty, and the spices complemented the liver well. My main was slightly disappointing. I was expecting a bit more bread, and it turns out I was eating the chicken as bread for awhile. Oops. And the tomato sauce was a bit bland, and didn't really add to the meat. I think I would have been better off with just the mixed grill with couscous. Oh well.Then after we decided to leave, it took another long period of time before we could flag down the server to get our bill. And another long period of time before someone came over so we could pay our bill. So that was slightly annoying.So the food was good, but the service let it down a bit. But the venue is nice, so that's something. If someone wanted to go, I'd probably go back, but I might seek out other Turkish places to go if I was in the mood for that type of food.",

Can get a meal and under \u00a312.The meat plates are executed well, kebabs not over cooked and juicy and tender.The set for 2 is all vegetarian, carnivores be warned.Service is pretty laid back and you need to be proactive to get serve staffs' attention.",

    "text": "Our hotel suggested this restaurant and we went there after a long day at various museums. What an awesome place! We've eaten Turkish food before but the menu was new to us. However, the service was excellent and we received great suggestions on what to order. The food smelled delicious and tasted even better. New spices in interesting combinations. I had a pea and carrot dish called \u00a0Bezelye Sote which was savory and a little spicy and delicious. My boyfriend had the Tas Special of lamb and potatoes and he liked his dish very much. We had Baklava and Kanafeh for dessert and they were wonderful too . We made plans to go back again for our last night in London.You can't miss a chance to eat a delicious meal like this! Or to be welcomed by the great staff. Treat yourself to a trip to Tas!",

    "text": "Okay this is gonna be a loooooong review so may the gods give you strength! The d\u00e9cor: slightly 70's looking pale yellow, light wood tones and lots of unnecessary turquoise accents everywhere - a little like being inside a mosque in the Ottoman Empire. \u00a0During my visit with a friend Tas is near empty; granted it was the tail-end of the weekend, but this is central London after all - you'd expect the location to be ideal for business regardless of time. \u00a0We order from the prefixed menu: 3 courses for \u00a319.95 - not unreasonable. \u00a0The appetizer selection of 5 dishes included something unfamiliar so we asked if we could switch to something that we actually recognized. \u00a0After looking a little horrified the young waiter goes to ask the manager for permission. \u00a0The request is turned down even though what we wanted is actually cheaper than the existing item on the set menu so if anything, it would have been to their advantage! \u00a0The appetizers arrive and there's hummus, then a yogurty dish, then an artichoke, potato and tomato thingy, then an eggplant dish and finally dolmas sitting on a bed of lettuce thing, all lacking salt or any discernible taste. \u00a0The main course takes a while to arrive but when it does it's actually not half bad- not award-winning but better than expected. \u00a0Perhaps that is the key to their success: low expectations. \u00a0 When we eventually ask for a box for our leftovers this is where things take a turn for the bizarre: \u00a0the nervous little waiter takes our plates away and promptly returns to inform us that since the kitchen has closed he has no access to boxes, or anything else. \u00a0This is confusing as well as disturbing, because you see #1: it is nowhere near closing time and #2: we had yet to get dessert which was the last part of our delightful 3 course meal. \u00a0When we remind him of this minor fact, he apologizes and scuffles away once again, visibility sweating now. \u00a0I am beginning to fear for this guy's life. \u00a0There we sit and wait - utterly baffled. \u00a0Soon another guy who looks like he could belong to the Russian mafia comes over and says no dessert in broken English (which I know is hard to achieve when you're only got two words to work with, but achieve it he did). \u00a0Clearly they were bringing out the big guns to deal with our very threatening behaviour! \u00a0After we explain our dilemma he agrees that we can go ahead and order dessert. \u00a0Fantastic - we look at the menu and decide. \u00a0When we inform the original waiter he says that particular dessert is unavailable and to try again. \u00a0We ask him to let us know what is in fact available; he says one second and runs away - again!!Yet another guy then shows up. \u00a0This one, who seems to have a slightly more managerial role, is less frightening looking but equally clueless. \u00a0He explains that since WE took such a long time to eat dinner the kitchen closed and the chef has gone home and as such only the cold desserts are available- they can no longer cook anything. \u00a0A little stunned, we remind him that THEY took their sweet time delivering the entrees and no one actually told us the kitchen was about to close, so how about fixing the problem instead of placing the blame on the customer?! \u00a0He too said one minute and disappeared. \u00a0He didn't actually go far - just to a corner to immediately get on the phone. \u00a0After an eternity and what we assumed to have been several confidential calls with the secret service, he came back to say he didn't know what to say! \u00a0He wasn't unpleasant - just completely helpless, defeated, borderline pathetic. \u00a0He accepted that what had happened was \"unexcusable\" and was prepared to adjust the bill to reflect the lack of the third course. \u00a0Fair enough we said, by this point so thoroughly annoyed and exhausted that we didn't care about having dessert any more. \u00a0(And equally unwilling to correct his grammar - saying unexcusable instead of inexcusable is, well, inexcusable!) \u00a0He went away once again, and returned a little more apologetically this time having reduced the bill by 50%! \u00a0Not quite able to believe this was actually approved by the faceless gods running the show behind the scenes, and thinking surely there must be a mistake, we quickly paid and legged it out of there as fast as we could. \u00a0I do wonder what fate befell that poor bastard since everything seemed so tightly and mysteriously remote controlled, with the staff completely powerless to make the simplest decisions without getting NATO clearance first. \u00a0Hopefully he wasn't taken out the back and shot on the spot. \u00a0 \u00a0Okay, rant over.",

The place is located at a walking distance from the British museum and the location is pretty central; there is a big crowd passing by pretty much the whole time so don't be surprised if the place is packed.Exclamation point on the Pacanga - it's so, so delicious, smooth and crispy all at the same time.",
