We had visited it's sister place Chutney Mary's and were very pleased although we just had small bites in the bar. Veersawamy is beautiful. The view over Regent Street incredible. The scents were amazing and we were ready for a fantastic meal and experience. We were disappointed with both. Our server was cold and not attentive. She was on the sarcastic side and treated us like the tourists we were. Tourists who love London! She was neither British nor Indian and seemed to be miserable. That is unfortunate for her customers who spend high $$$ at Veeraswamy for food we could get in Central Square in Cambridge, MA or at a food truck in Portland, OR. Overpriced. Limited menu. Big disappointment.",

Methinks not.Best dishes:- Green curry prawns (large, delicious - however the appetizer only comes with 2 prawns)- Pineapple curry (sweet, but with a little kick - this was almost dessert-like for me)Everything else:- Lamb Biryani - good (not worth the price tag)- Duck Vindaloo - I've had better duck elsewhere, but this was good- Chiken Makhani - tasty, would order again- Basket of Bread (three different types of Na'an) - disappointing (was expecting bursts of different flavors - or at least something noticeable, but this was all-around rather bland)- Spinach Saag (I wanted some kind of vegetable - because everything else is very heavy - this was rather unmemorable though)Rounding up from 3.5. Would likely never return, but enjoyed my meal while it lasted.",

    "text": "The second pillar in the Holy Trinity of Indian food in London (see my Amaya review).Veeraswamy would be my go-to choice of the three higher end Masala Zone restaurants (Amaya and Chutney Mary being the other two to choose from). \u00a0It is slightly less expensive than Amaya, making it a bit more attainable for an evening out.The general decor and ambiance of Veeraswamy is gorgeous. \u00a0Outstanding wait staff service. \u00a0Fantastic food. \u00a0It is really difficult to find a quality restaurant like this in its location near Picadilly Circus. \u00a0Veeraswamy is a great option for a classy dinner before heading out to the theater or just going out in that area.I've had multiple fish dishes, octopus, shrimp curry, multiple biriyanis, and more and they've all been phenomenal. \u00a0They have a great wine menu as well, which pairs excellently with any of their entrees. \u00a0Their custom cocktails are also quite delicious (there was some sort of spicy martini I tried last time that was wonderful).The waiters are always incredibly helpful in determining the appropriate meal size and selection. \u00a0They are also very knowledgable about their wine and cocktail list to suggest pairings. \u00a0They managed to make each of my three dining experiences there equally unique and enjoyable.I could not recommend Veeraswamy any more strongly! \u00a0Great for a date night out, group or business dinner, or any nice occassion, really.**same note as my Amaya review - check out the Masala Zone website for discounts, promotions or specials before you go!",

This restaurant was on our short list and we chanced upon it whilst strolling Regent Street. 1. Very little Indian food aroma that lingers in your hair long after the foods gone.2. Fresh ingredients , no BS recipes or silly names for everyday dishes, good selection representing various Indian cuisines3. Interesting artwork and pictures on wall, informal atmosphere4. Helpful ,polite well trained staff.5. Its not cheap, but so worth it.Thanks Veeraswamy for a memorable London evening..:):)",

It's not the most expensive but it's pricey enough to expect something a little bit better than what I got.I was in a big group and it was a Tue evening. We ordered a lot of finger food starters, chicken wings and the like. All overdone and no care taken over them at all. The accompanying sauces weren't in the slightest bit vibrant or surprising. When I eat Indian I want something vibrant and surprising.My duck masala main course was again perfectly edible but carelessly done. Very overdone and with a ubiquitous masala sauce. I tried two of my guests' food. The lobster curry was a little more delicate without being amazing in any way.I would expect this sort of food in a decent high street curry house. But the prices are far greater than that so you're paying for the area and the room inside which is a shame when there's so much great indian food around at the moment. I'm lucky enough to live near Indian Zing in Hammersmith and the food there knocks the food here into a cocked hat at a much much fairer price.",

    "text": "Solid Indian restaurant in London but probably not worth the \"1st Indian Restaurant in London\" premium you have to fork over. After all, first isn't necessarily the best. I went to Veeraswamy for a business dinner not knowing the history of it. The waitstaff was extremely attentive and the decor was what you would have expected of a high-end Indian place.For appetizers, we split the Raj Puri (which was spot on delicious - perfectly crispy on the outside with the right amounts of creme and sauces inside - I could eat 3 of these just for my main course) \u00a0and the Sagg Panner (2 triangle chunks of paneer with a thin layer of sagg (spinach) inside. Quite uninspiring and I wouldn't get it again.For my main course, I had the vegetarian sampler - which included dal (lentils), kofta (ball of ground chickpeas), two other dishes that I don't remember and I didn't really care for. The dal and the kofta were delicious! I didn't care for the other two. We also had a side of sagg, which normal sagg with tons of garlic but nothing unique. \u00a0Rice and naan were ordered separately on the side, which is annoying.My dessert was a banana kulfi (think banana ice cream). It was the way Kulfi was supposed to be - mildly sweet and fragrant with all the Indian spices. If only they could have had Saffron Kulfi, I would have been in paradise. We also tried a Black Jaman. That was presented rather peculiarly but definitely satisfies any sweet tooth you may have.I had Cobra beer (just one), and the wait-staff continually tried to push more on me. Quite annoying. \u00a0The beer selection was limited, with only Cobra and no Kingfisher..Overall, Veeraswamy was nice to try out and enjoyable since I wasn't paying, but if I did pay, I'd pick something more affordable for the same quality of food. Total bill, including gratuity, was about \u00a3200 for a group of 3.",

Our table decided to go for the taster menu. All in all, I think when you're in a large group of people it's a great idea. We had two rounds of starters that where ok but not impressive followed by a strong entourage of curries of both pork and lamb and a very light dessert. The curries where very much traditional and tasty. Highly recommended. A large part of the reason why they don't have the fifth star was the bad service. We waited quite a bit of time between starters and drinks and desserts took a while to arrive as well. Additionally there was quite a bit of perceived hostility between our waiters which detracted from the experience. That coupled with the weak starters and the cotton candy flavored lychee ice tea make this a good restaurant to go to, just slightly overpriced for it's quality.",

The ambiance is wonderful and the food is quite good. But the food isn't in the creative/fusion category, and the restaurant prides itself as traditional. As a traditional fare, it just isn't that interesting or traditional. It tries to be chic and refined, but yet the food just isn't that special or exceptional to warrant the price. \u00a0You are paying for the ambiance. \u00a0The appetisers are more refined though, which I would recommend. I almost would argue having a full meal based on the appetisers as they have more subtleties and complexities that I would pay for. For the traditional curry and grill items, you can do better at many other places for half the prices and bigger portion. Punjab (Covent Garden) and Tiger Spices (Soho) are both cheaper and have more flavorful food with big curry kicks. For a glass of wine, a starter, two curries (portions are small and don't have much sauces) and a dessert, you are looking at about 45-50 quids.",

Come here if you fancy an extravagant but glorious Indian experience. Veeraswamy is the oldest Indian retaurant in town and has quite auspicious beginnings - it was opened by an Indian Princess and English General and its new world flavours were an instant hit with the upper classes. The fact that it is still here is testament to the quality of the food. All regions of India are covered here, including some that are rarely prepared outside of the country itself. The Nizami Murgh that was recommended to me (chicken breast and koftas with pine nut, lemon and rose petal) was heavenly and there are coastal dishes such as Mussels Moilee which are firm favourites. If you want to eat in an opulent setting (gilded ceilings and chandeliers), and to experience real Indian cuisine it may cost you around \u00a350 all in all but is an experience you won't soon forget.",

I hadn't tasted such authentic food since I was in India (currently live in Hong Kong) - I really enjoyed all of the dishes. Interestingly enough, the much touted prawn curry was the most average to me. The highlight was ending the meal with tea which had been described in a very wine like fashion (and also served in wine glasses) - classy touch to a lovely meal",

This is the oldest Indian restaurant in London. \u00a0It was recommended to me during a business trip in Albuquerque of all places. \u00a0It pays to talk to your neighbors at the bar. \u00a0I have eaten here twice and both experiences were great. Their cocktails are amazing-the combination of flavors and aromatics cannot be duplicated. I seem to always order lobster when I dine at Indian places in London. \u00a0They just know how to cook lobster like no other group! \u00a0It's located close to many theaters. Reservations are a must here.",

Where the service itself is ok, but the food quality, that is got, does not really match the price given. I don't understand why you order Indian food and have to order the rise or nan bread in addition. At least a portion of rise should come with the food.So after all you feel a little cheated, though the quality is ok.The overall feeling in the restaurant is very good.",

    "text": "We did quite a bit of research and wanted to go to an Indian restaurant with some history in London. This certainly fit the bill. It also recently received a Michelin star. Coming from a place in the US that is chock full of good Indian options (SE Michigan), I had high hopes for the city that my British friends claim is the \"best place for Indian in the world\". The place is very classy, with a nice address in Piccadilly Circus. The interior decor is rich with hints of Indian accents. We ordered a number of items from the menu including the mango avocado salad, the crab ginger soup, the vegetarian platter, and the shrimp curry. I asked if they had paratha, which they did not. Fine, we'll have the roti. The roti featured exactly one piece for 5 pounds. I thought we'd have at least two pieces for that price! Our appetizers were good, but the crab was non-existant in the crab ginger soup. It was mostly just ginger soup with a few tiny scraps of crab meat. The veggie appetizer came in bowls that yielded a spoonful or two of food. The spinach ball dish in the platter with almond dressing was most interesting, but gone in two bites. The shrimp curry was fine, but nothing memorable. At the end, with no alcohol, our tab for two was 125 pounds. I could eat for a week of Indian food for that. Had it been great, I would have been able to justify the price. But the miserly portions, unremarkable dishes, combined with the long wait between the appetizer and mains, makes this s a first and last visit for us.",

Apart from the beautiful setting and attentive service, our Vegetable Bhajia starter was the highlight of the meal... think of a mouth watering Indian-style tempura (Bell Peppers, Green Beans, Onions, Broccoli) as opposed to the fritters normally served in restaurants. I had a gorgeously presented Coconut Chicken dish for my main, prepared with a spicy korma-esque sauce and garnished with a spicy chilli on top. With a generous bread basket on the side, I found that even absent sides, I was more than stuffed by the end and even passed on dessert. For vegetarians, the Crescent Platter offers a plethora of choices, though the Daal dish stood out compared to the others. In the opinion of my wife (who is a veggie), these were some of the very best lentils in London.The quality and location come with a price tag, and while not shocked by the total of our meal - it was relatively punchy: 10-15 GBP for starters, 20-35 GBP for mains, with sides also running closer to 10 GBP than to 5. Throw in a few drinks, and the bill can start to add up pretty quickly...",

It took them 30 min, at least, to serve us water. When we asked the waitress about it, she blamed it on the bus boy. The food was decent, but not worth the 200 bucks we spent there. I ordered the homemade organic paneer, layered with green herbs and green mango, and finished off with nutmeg and cardamom. Very good. My cocktail was decent, but still pretty sweet (although the waitress smirked when I asked for it not to be too sweet, and said, \"Oh no, it's not sweet at all\"). Wrong. I had the veggie crescent platter, and the only standout was the paneer tikka masala. Even then, it wasn't nearly as good as the veggie dishes we had the previous night at Roti Chai.One last thing, we asked for naan to accompany our takeaway (we figured we should take our leftovers for a late night snack, since we'd forked over $200 for them). The waitress seriously went into a 5 minute explanation about how it would taste chewy if we reheated it later and she didn't recommend it. Lame. Give us what we ordered, we are paying for it.She then brought the naan out 10 minutes later, on a plate, as if we were going to eat it there. She explained, \"I brought it out like this because the chef gets upset if people order takeaway, but I can pack it now bc it's been served\". WTF. Who says that? Doesn't the client always come first?She never came back to give us our check. We had to ask the bus boy for it, so that we could GTFO.Suck it, Veeraswamy.",

    "text": "What an incredible disappointment.This was possibly the most pompous and underwhelming restaurant to which I've ever been. \u00a0The problems started with our cocktails, which even after requesting they not be made sweet, came out as if they were made with tablespoons of sugar. \u00a0Gross. \u00a0The waitress' condescension began here, by the way, with her arrogant proclamation (when we ordered) that the drinks were not made anyway but perfectly. \u00a0Yeah, whatever. They tasted like drinks teenagers would drink. \u00a0Amateurish.Our appetizers were a mixed affair. \u00a0The herb paneer was excellent; the softest cheese scented with nutmeg and cardamom. \u00a0The crab cake however was dry and flavorless, it tasted like chewing seafood sandpaper. \u00a0How do you screw up a crab cake?At this point, 20 mins later, still no water as requested when we ordered our drinks.Our entrees arrive. \u00a0Again, a mixed affair. \u00a0The chicken tikka was good, not great; a solid blend of sweet and smoky spices. \u00a0The saag however was dismal, it tasted like spinach run through a blender and slopped on a plate without any seasoning. It was inedible. \u00a0My wife's veggie platter was so-so, a couple dishes were good, the aubergine was poor. \u00a0 But at least our water now had arrived! Small victory. \u00a0But at the end of our meal pretty much, accompanied by an apology from our waitress who blamed the bar. For the 30 min delay -for water. \u00a0Nice.Last, and this would fall under the insult to injury category, we asked for the remaining food to be packed to go except for the spinach and aubergine, and requested the addition of a naan. I then had to hear a lecture on how naan is not meant to be taken away and how would it rot in daylight or to another's touch outside the restaurant and (this part is no exaggeration) the chef gets very mad if patrons do takeaway. Are you fucking kidding me? I couldn't believe how arrogant and pompous this waitress was. \u00a0Who cares what the fucking chef thinks, it's a piece of naan! Please pass this on to the chef and to the owner: if the food was as made carefully and service as half as polished as you manicure your inflated sense of ego, you'd be getting more than 1 star. \u00a0And put a Kevlar vest around the chef's delicate heart and tell them the spinach and crab cake sucked ass. So many other places we've been to like Roti Chai and Dishoom outclass this place in terms of food quality and service, skip this place and spend your money elsewhere. \u00a0What a waste of time, money, and patience.",

    "text": "I was on a business trip in London this past May and had a friend come visit me during the second week I was there. The one thing we really wanted to eat was good Indian food. I had gotten recommendations from a few coworkers, both of which recommended Amaya, a sister restaurant to Veeraswamy, which was actually recommended to my friend by someone else.We arrived at Veeraswamy at approximately 7:30 PM on Wednesday night, sans reservation. To our surprise, there were no tables available and the earliest reservation we could make was for 9:30. We decided to put our name down and and go grab some drinks at a nearby pub. The restaurant is in a nice area of the city, near lots of shops (which were unfortunately closed by that time of the evening) and restaurants, so we didn't have to go far to find another place to hang out. After having a couple of drinks, we decided to go back to the restaurant at around 8:45. We were able to wait in their upstairs lounge, which was actually just a few small tables near a bench, until our table was ready. We each ordered a glass of wine which was brought to us promptly. Luckily for us, coming back early was a good choice because we were seated about 5 minutes later! The restaurant was beautifully decorated and had a vibrant color scheme that reminded me a lot of India (I'm part Indian). We studied the menu after being seated and finally decided what we wanted. Our waiter took our order and we anxiously awaited for our dishes to arrive. The service was great throughout the night, even though the restaurant was filled to capacity when we sat down to eat. We started our meal with the green herb paneer tikka, which was made up of homemade paneer with various herbs and spices. The paneer was the right consistency and went perfectly with the herbs. For our main course, we ordered the Kerala prawn curry and the tandoori raan. The prawn curry was full of flavor and had the right amount of spice. I had never had a Kerala style curry before, but it's made with coconut milk and therefore reminded me of a Thai red curry more than a traditional Indian curry. The tandoori raan was probably our favorite dish, which was a slow cooked lamb shank in a garam masala infused cashew sauce. The meat was tender and fell apart easily. The sauce was incredible - I would have drunk it if that was socially acceptable. Instead, I resorted to pouring it over my rice. We also ordered naan and some saag (an Indian creamed spinach of sorts) to accompany our meal, both which were also very good. I think we forced ourselves to finish all the food we ordered, despite being full, because it was that amazing. We couldn't not have dessert, so we order the gulab jamun, which is a traditional Indian milk-based dessert. The dessert came with ice cream and a raspberry sauce. It was very good, but I think I prefer the more traditional version of the dessert served in most Indian restaurants. If I am ever back in London, I would not hesitate to visit Veeraswamy again (or maybe try one of its sister restaurants). This really was a dinner to remember!",

I thoroughly enjoyed their naan as well.The service was outstanding. \u00a0We were greeted at the door, at the front desk, and almost as soon as we were seated. \u00a0Our waiter consistently checked in and we never wanted for anything. \u00a0If you get the opportunity to try this place out its worth the money!!",

The portions were certainly generous, but the flavors themselves I found a little lacking. Granted, I visited for lunch so perhaps it was not their best work, but I would have to say I've found better in the US (such as Rasika in DC).",

There are in fact so many that it made deciding where to eat a challenge, but after scouring reviews and asking local friends for their opinions, we landed on Veeraswamy.You enter on the ground floor and take an elevator up to the restaurant which features authentic Indian decor. With so many amazing dishes to choose from we asked our friendly, attentive and helpful waiter for advice.We started with the Raj Kachori which was artfully presented as its a large wheat puri filled with goodies. It was delicious. We also had the Angara Chicken Tikka which came with spicy boneless chicken thigh pieces smoked with garam masala and mace; and lastly, we shared the Tandoori green paws which were light and flavorful served in a coriander, mint, chili sauce.For our main dishes we had the Kerala prawn curry. The prawns were served in a coconut curry that was slightly spicy. We also has the Hyderabadi Nimboo Dopiaza which featured a large portion of chicken breasts served in a spicy sauce with lim, chili and cumin; and lastly, we had the Hyderabadi Lamb Biryani which has subtly spiced and has apparently been on the menu since 1926.All of the dishes were delicious and cooked perfectly. The only thing I would change is to order less chicken dishes and one less appetizer. \u00a0The restaurant met my high expectations and I would definitely go back.",

Yet everything we tried was one of the best Indian dishes I've tasted, and we tried quite a few items, sampling four appetizers and a vegetarian main that included four separate dishes. Particular highlights were the Raj Kachori, a fancy version of Indian street food consisting of a crisp wheat puri filled with goodies, and Scallop Moilee, which came in a stunning coconut and ginger sauce. My wife is a Chicken Tikka aficionado, and proclaimed this one the best Indian dish she ever tasted.There is also an excellent wine list, highlighted by some very well-described white and red Burgundies.This will definitely be the Indian restaurant we return to on our next visit to London.",

I was born in India, raised in Australia and Canada. It's my first time in London, and I have been recommended Veerasamy by many friends. Thank you to the owners of VEERASWAMY for proving such pleasant memories for my first and hopefully last visit to your restaurant. More Detailed Experience Below: Ordering Experience: We were well received well by the hostess and was directed us to the table. Menu looks solid, and called the server to make the order.1. Asked to order Gravy, Naan/Roti and Tandoori Dish. This is our standard order when we go to Indian restaurants. 2. Server said \"Can you order more food\" and my response \"I am good, this should be more than enough\" 3. Server advised us that there is a MINIMUM SPEND of 60 pounds (can't remember the exact $$) per person limit that we had to order. I have never seen this before and I explained to him that we don't eat that much food. 4. We ended up adding a Biriyani and another dish to the existing order to come close to the amount which the server was fine with. 5. Server comes back and asks us if we want Raita or drinks. I said NO, I DO NOT. He advised us again to order more food when he specifically said \"This should be enough\"6. I spoke to the manager about the service provided \"Do you want Raita? Do you want a Drink? Management will not accept? \" - Manager: He was arrogant, rude and did not give me a proper explanation of this garbage service that has been provided to my parents and I. 7. Apart from the lovely hostess that greeted us with a big smile, the remaining was despicable. **CAUTION** - PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT AND EXPECT A FINE DINING EXPERIENCE. Beware of the fine print on the menu before you order your food. If you want good Indian food, please go to Dishoom. They provided amazing customer service and the food was fantastic.",

    "text": "Veeraswamy is London's longest standing restaurant (since 1926) and it's obvious why it's still around! My husband and I continue to rave about this restaurant and both agree that it was easily our favorite meal during our trip.The restaurant is located upstairs in a building with a view of Regent Street. You'll check in with the hostess and take the elevator upstairs, where another host will show you to your table. My husband and I opted for the 3 course menu (appetizer, main course, and dessert). We started off with the mulligatawny soup to start, lamb kashmiri and chicken makhani as our entrees, and galub jamun for dessert. Every single item was OFF. THE. CHAIN. All of our dishes were bursting with flavor and there was a smooth balance of spice and savoriness. The meats and the veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly.The service was very friendly from start to finish. The manager checked up on us, and our server checked up on us frequently, but we never felt like it was overbearing. The hosts were also very friendly to us.As they are well deserving of their Michelin star, I would highly recommend reservations which can be easily made through OpenTable.",

Flavors were explosive, fresh and the meats and seafoods were cooked perfectly. Prices are a little higher than most, but I think it's definitely worthwhile. No doubt one of the best out there.",

The restaurant is on the second floor, but the hostess stand is on the ground level. You check in, and they send you to an elevator, up to the restaurant. The whole thing gives this Hong Kong Fuey kinda vibe.Pampered by the red carpet service of 5-Star Indian cuisine in an elegant room overlooking a streetwide parade protesting fox-hunting... well, that's how it was the day we went!!!I ordered the \"tasting menu\" or whatever they called it, and each bite was better than the previous. An amazing chicken app and the most astounding prawn ever preceded my main course: a flight of curries.AAAAHHHHHHHH!!! (Light shines down from above and I begin weeping).Seriously, this food will ruin Indian food for me for years, cuz there's NO WAY it's going to be this good any time soon. Sorry, everywhere else.",

    "text": "A colleague of.mine had recommended this place and so I decided to pay a visit. Reservations are essential here as I discovered that this restaurant had 1 Michelin star to it's name. I had dined at Quillon on a previous London trip so it was nice to have the chance to compare 2 London based Michelin started Indian restaurants.It was fortunate that I had a reservation as the restaurant seats about 40 and there were only a few tables for 1-2. The restaurant was about 30% full when I arrived at 6.30 but it slowly filled up. I was seated promptly after I exited from the elevator on the first floor. The decor of the restaurant is traditional Indian with some modern touches. Definitely more traditional than Quillon.I decided to order 2 dishes that were on the original 1926 menu: mulligatawny soup and the lamb briyani. These are quintessential Indian dishes as well. Unlike previous reviews, both dishes did not lack flavor in the least. Certainly the lamb briyani was as spicy as anything I have ever tasted in India, Singapore or Malaysia. The mulligatawny soup had a nice flavor, with good balance and interesting texture from the rice and onions in the soup. The lamb briyani was of a good portion size - enough for 2 to share. The lamb was tender and flavorful and the basmati rice was soft, fluffy and just sufficiently moist without clumping. At the end of the meal, I was too full to have dessert so I had to skip that but there were a number of good options available, both Indian and non-Indian. The restaurant also had a very good wine list and drink list.The service, I must say, was very attentive and warm, in keeping with the Michelin starred restaurants I have been to. I was attended by the main and assistant waiter and the supervisor also checked in twice to see how the food was. Comparing to Quillon, I would say come to Veerasamy for more traditional Indian style food and surroundings. I would say Quillon is a more contemporary Indian restaurant with a more modern interpretation of Indian cuisine. It's probably more accessible to Western or British palates as well. Both restaurants shined where it came to their drink and wine list and service. Price wise - they're similar though Quillon had smaller portion sizes. If you have the chance and the funds, I would say try both!",

We went with our children and they were very accommodating in helping us find options they thought the kids would like. We had a show to catch and we asked if they could seat us sooner. They were able to seat us one hour earlier. Now to the food. What can I say, not one bad thing on the table. But the highlight for me was the starter Raj Kachori. It was puff pastry filled with heaven. It was like a work of art, I didn't want to eat it. Anyway, everything else was up to par with all then reviews. Recommend for lunch or evening.",

    "text": "My boyfriend is an indian food fanatic. If he could, I think he would eat Indian food 3 times a day, seven days a week, and still never get bored. Over the past three years of our relationship, we have been everywhere from traditional restaurants in Cambridge, York and Brick Lane, \"modern\" indians like Bombay Bicycle Club, Masala Zone and Imli, and \"upmarket\" joints like Amaya. So, when I decided that an Indian tasting menu would be the perfect birthday present for him, I knew I needed somewhere special. And that place was Veeraswamy. As previous reviewers have mentioned, Veeraswamy is the oldest running Indian restaurant in London, which gives the place a sense of history. This is evident from the turbans hanging on the walls: gifts from visiting Maharajahs. I booked the table weeks in advance and had 1 very annoying request: I wanted the tasting menu for both of us, but I don't eat red meat - would it be possible to do one veggie? Now, any foodie worth their salt will know that the rule is always the same: the tasting menu has to be ordered by the whole table. Not so at Veeraswamy. The restaurant was delightfully accomodating, not only over the phone, but in person too. I can honestly say that the restaurant has the nicest, most welcoming staff I have ever come across. The gentleman who led us to the table reassured me that the chef is well aware of my request, but then reappeared a few minutes later to say, \"The chef is worried that you're only having vegetables in your meal - he would like to know if you'd like some prawns with your main course?\" Could they get any nicer? I am still salivating over my starter: Raj kachori (a large crisp puri filled with lentils, tamarind chutney and yoghurt). This was beautifully presented with little pomegranate jewels, and the taste was extraordinary. And boy, am I glad I ordered the prawns: the giant green prawn was a dry dish with an intense flavour which followed perfectly on from my light starter. Alongside a keralan chicken curry (which I also tried) and a lamb curry (which I didn't), my boyfriend was in heaven. The mango sorbet was the perfect end to the meal, but this was topped (if possible) when they brought out another tart, dark chocolate sorbet with a candle in it - completely out of the restaurant's own impetus - which made my night. Yes, it's not exactly street food prices, but then it's not exactly your average Indian. It's special, and you pay for what you get - wonderful staff, delicious food and a colourful, romantic atmosphere right in the heart of London.",

    "text": "At the time I ate here, I hadn't been to India yet and understandably, the food I had in Delhi was better than the food I had here. However, up until I ate here, I had never really liked Indian food. I hadn't written it off and for that reason, I was down for eating here when it was suggested.I heard the stories of how this is the oldest Indian restaurant in the UK and how tons of famous folks eat here. That doesn't necessary make it good by default, but with the many choices of decent Indian food in London, I think it does mean something that the restaurant has been in business for so long. Places go out of business regularly, especially in these times.Now onto the food. We had quite a spread because a) I didn't know what I wanted and b) I was eating with two people (my father (travels to India at least 10 times a year) and an Indian) who couldn't settle on one thing to get. I have to say that I loved the tandoori chicken--it melted in my mouth and is to die for. Everything we had was good, down to the Indian ice cream. The service was good too. They were patient as we figured out what we wanted and were always nearby if we needed anything. Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the decor; it's gorgeous. Glass chandeliers, modern furniture, peaceful ambiance. You'd never guess that the restaurant was so old based solely on the decoration. I go to London fairly regularly and though this place is pricey, I will definitely go back!",

However, our waitress was lackadaisical, slow, snobbish, and flippantly rude. And when I say \"slow\", I mean excruciatingly slow with suggestions like \"I'm sure you want to wait until the next course.\" Well, actually, no. I don't want to wait 15-25 minutes between each course. \u00a0It cast a pall over the lovely dishes - which were, indeed, fine - but certainly not awe-inspiring by any stretch of the imagination. The lamb knuckles were delicious and tender. The chicken in the chicken curry, however, was tough. Great naan. Mediocre rice. The best thing was their interpretation of \"street food\" chaat - which was fantastic. We had the tasting menu - 75 pounds with wine per person. After cocktails and the chaat (which we ordered separately) it's a pretty hefty price to pay (about 200 pounds - $320 or so) for the \"thanks\" that she tossed off with a shrug of her shoulders. She seemed offended that we didn't want coffee or tea. How barbaric of us. I don't recommend this restaurant - you're much better off at a smaller, family-run place - where the quality of food will be very similar and with a staff who is glad to serve you.",

Although we had a reservation at 5:30 on Saturday 4th Jan we decided to not dine there solely based on the level of service provided. We reached Veeraswamy at 5:20 and were told by the ma\u00eetre d' to wait outside on the street till the restaurant opened. When asked whether we could wait at the long seating area where a couple was already waiting, we were told that the area would get crowded although the sofa at the waiting area could seat at least 5 more. We went down and immediately after another couple walked up. We waited to see whether they would be told the same. But to our surprise they were not asked to wait on the streets as they never walked back out. When we went back to ask about that the ma\u00eetre d' acted as if he was not sure what we were talking about. We decided at that point not to dine there and went somewhere else. To me this is a first and quite discriminating and in most parts of the world would be considered racist as we were the only people of Indian origin who were waiting at that point of time. I was also surprised that an establishment of such stature have such disappointing service. To be fair we were contacted after half an hour but by that point it honestly felt because they had an empty table left. The food may be fantastic but if the service is this bad I honestly can't recommend it to anyone.",

Purely because V iis the oldest restaurant meant I had to add it to my list along with the spurious Top 10s etc. I knew it was expensive so had waited for my 50th birthday to justify dragging the family 120 miles south for a curry. Every restaurant will have mixed reviews, why? The decor is impressive but I have seen better. Whether the the food is poor, good or excellent is your opinion, I think this is often down to people not really knowing what they've actually ordered. Indian, Pakistani and the more common Bangladeshi restaurants have their own characteristics. My tip for a good meal is take your time, talk to the waiter and question the menu and (if in doubt) make sure you know exactly what your getting, it's your money. One man's bhuna is another man's mulligatawny. My experience was overall very good but it I thought it wasn't worth the money although my wife & kids did. I particularly disliked the fact that none of the staff had Asian heritage but appreciate it could be different on another night.",

Indeed, National Geographic reckons Veeraswamy is among the ten best destination and special restaurants in the world. If you've got the cash, love Indian cuisine and fancy a superb view over Regent Street, I highly recommend a visit. Menu highlights include a starter course of irresistibly crisp green leaf and okra bhajias (whole okra and leaves of fenugreek, ruby chard and mint coated in a light rice flour batter, \u00a39) with a particularly creamy coriander and mint sauce and a tangy tamarind chutney with pomegranate seeds. For the main course, consider the Sholay chicken tikka smoked with garam masala (\u00a39 as a starter, \u00a318 as a main). Charred right bits of especially tender chicken with a bit of kick, I'd definitely choose that dish again. Another item I'd certainly be keen to enjoy again is the side dish of fresh pineapple curry (pineapple, curry, mustard and green chilli, \u00a39). Unusually savoury, I'd go back for it alone. Veeraswamy's flaky on the outside/fluffy on the inside layered naan (\u00a33.35) are delectable, while kaala jaam (large black gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream, \u00a36.75) for puds ends any Indian feast on a moreish note. Right off Regent Street (the restaurants' first floor dining room hovers above it), with an ethnic without being kitsch atmosphere, incredibly attentive service, fascinating history and an exceptionally tasty menu: Veerswamy is an elegant restaurant serving delectable Indian cuisine.",

    "text": "Our hotel recommended this restaurant and we were quite excited to learn it is the oldest Indian restaurant in London. We had an early lunch here on a Sunday morning in June including myself, my husband and our 8 year old daughter. It is not really a place for kids but they did make some recommendations that were not too spicy for her as well as a yummy drink recommendation too. That drink was a rose water lemonade drink that she and I both LOVED!The decor is absolutely beautiful with colorful lamps and comfortable seating. We had a chicken wing appetizer which was one of the most flavorful dishes I've ever had. We also had a tandoori chicken which was so tender and smoky. My husband ate a fantastic chicken vindaloo which he loved, although I believe he would have liked it spicier. I thought it was perfect.The service was good but they mixed up our teas - they said the jasmine tea was the black tea and the black tea was the jasmine tea. We thought that was extremely odd for them not to know the teas and that we had to tell them the difference. But not a big deal.Overall, we loved it.",

But I have to say that this place is AMAZING. The food was cheap enough considering all that we got. \u00a0I had the lamp binary? Is that how its spelled? It was amazing. There were lots of vegetarian options for my friend.The server was a bit awkward about everything. It was fine though. He didnt speak great english, but he was nice. If I was a resident in London, I would certainly go back this week. But since I was just visiting from San Diego, it probably be a while before i go back :/",

The restaurant is beautiful and stylish too. Expensive (\u00a370/person for dinner, not including drinks), but generally good service and presentation combined with excellently prepared dishes.",

    "text": "Welcome to the most expensive curry house on the whole planet. I first tried it in the seventies when the restaurant was owned by an Englishman by the name of Edwin Palmer. He grew up in Hyderabad in India. He also marketed a selection of jarred curry products under the name of E.P. Veeraswamy. What took me aback, like a dumb slapstick comedy, was being greeted at the elevator by a man dressed as a Hunzar, including a foot high cloth fin coming out of his hat, who saluted my date and I like we were four star generals. To this very day, it gives me a good laugh. The food was boringly mild and tasteless. The price was through the stratosphere.New owners ditched the fake Hunzar in the elevator and greatly improved the quality of their menu. The food is excellent but incredibly London England style. As long as you are not looking for authentic and you want to stay close to the theatre district, Piccadilly Circus, or the West End you cannot go wrong on quality. Just bring a wheel barrow load full of money. I give it four stars for the food but two stars for the price, making a three. It is only a short ride on the tube to Queensway where you will find more authentic food with prices where you will only need a fistful of money and can leave the wheel barrow in your hotel safe. A better than five star Indo-Pakistani restaurant is Shezan in Knightsbridge for those with six figure incomes. The food is authentic Punjabi and Northwest Frontier.A multi course lunch at Veeraswamy for two will cost about 80 to 100 pounds and dinner about 120 to 150 pounds; more if you include a bottle of Champagne which I believe is the perfect wine match for Indian style food. Red wines clash, an Australian Shiraz the least, and the food overpowers most white wines except for a Gewurztraminer which can cost more that a magnum of bubbly. A glass of cold lager is even better and so much easier on the pocketbook.If you want authentic Amritsar Punjabi style, take the train to Southall from Paddington Station. It is a 30 minute ride and you will enjoy fabulous Masalas, Seekh Kebabs, naan, tikkas etc. for a fraction of the price and oh so much better. Dress casual for Southall and fancy for Veeraswamy.",

I had the tomatoe soup- lovely, the prawns- very bland and the Bharta. The Bharta was good as well but not authentic. Being Indian, I thought the food was very mild. The other three in the party had the tasting menu- which was decent. \u00a0All in all, \u00a0I know there are far superior places to eat Indian food in London so definitely not worth the 300gbps!",

When we arrived, we realized that this was not what we were planning as the menu was a bit pricey. But it was immediately obvious why this place has been around for 88 years!!!! The food was beautifully presented and flavorful without being overpowering. We did the tasting menu. It was a great way to get to sample the most popular dishes. If you want an upscale Indian dining experience, this is the place! At a 130 pounds without cocktails, just be prepared to pay extra for the fancy (yet delicious) version of Chicken Tikka and Lamb Rogan Gosh",
