    "text": "My wife and I came here for a special meal. \u00a0Our overall impression was that the food was well done, with some memorable courses, and freshness was a highlight. \u00a0However, the service was not as polished as you would expect for a two Michelin star restaurant.Our only option was to have the Tasting Menu, to be taken by both of us. \u00a0This can be good because it removes the stress of choice, when you see lots of tasty alternatives. \u00a0Before the tasting menu proper, we could have bread rolls - my favourite was the brioche one with bacon inside!The courses were as follows:1. Amuse bouches. \u00a0First was a squid ink \"cracker\" with a creamy mousse on top. \u00a0It was nice, but nothing special. \u00a0Second was a small soup with a seafood morsel inside - it was pleasant, but I can't remember more than that!2. Salad of Green Beans with Fresh Almonds, White Peach and Grated Fois Gras. \u00a0The nicest part was the grated fois gras. \u00a0I also liked the contrast of the white peach.3. Flame Grilled Mackerel with Pickled Cucumber, Celtic Mustard and Shiso. \u00a0This turned out to be the favourite course for both of us. \u00a0The mackerel really was cooked to perfection. \u00a0I particularly remember the tender flesh of the fish and the crispy skin.4. Steamed Asparagus with Duck Ham, Morels and Spring Truffle. \u00a0I have really grown to like asparagus when it has been cooked to the point where it is still firm. \u00a0We got a green one and a white one and they were cooked to my liking.5. Cornish Turbot with Crab, Fennel and Elderflower. \u00a0The turbot was cooked nicely and it fell apart on the plate. \u00a0I liked the combination with the fennel.6. Roast Quail with Peas, Black Pudding and Girolles. \u00a0This was a nice change from the fish courses.7. Short Rib of Ruby Red Beef with Celeriac Baked in Juniper and Bone Marrow. \u00a0I had actually forgotten about this course, so it was a welcome surprise when it arrived. \u00a0The beef was tender and I liked the fried potato. \u00a0However, it felt like there were a lot of \"extras\" on top of the beef that I had to work through. \u00a0My wife's one had a very tiny hair in it, which we told the waiter about. \u00a0He let us know that the chef was most apologetic about it.8. Pre-dessert. \u00a0This had a mango base, yoghurt and a granita on top. \u00a0It was a refreshing transition from the savoury courses to the sweet.9. Whipped Ewes Milk Yoghurt with English Strawberries and Lemon Verbena. \u00a0The best part of this was actually a strawberry sorbet which was so full of flavour. \u00a0The other components of the course went well, but as a whole it was not too memorable.10. Bonus dessert. \u00a0This one was the rectangular caramel bar which I had seen photos of and was very much looking forward to. \u00a0It actually tasted like caramel dairy food to me (sorry - NZ childhood reference) and I enjoyed the biscuit base.We had our meal with a full-bodied red wine recommended by the sommelier and our sparkling water was topped up all night (for no extra charge).The service was efficient, but felt a bit clinical most of the time. \u00a0When the service is at its best, then it feels more personable (like you and the waiter are in on a secret together). \u00a0That \"something extra\" felt missing in this case.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch on a Sunday and it did not disappoint. The food here is exceptional. We had the tasting menu at lunch, since we didn't want to eat a huge meal at the very end of the day (the problem with popular restaurants is.. you can't get a table at whatever hour you want). The restaurant itself was very nice. \u00a0The tables weren't squished together too much, although we were closer to the two tables on both sides than I would have preferred. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. \u00a0They did an excellent job. Each table also had an oval rock (dense glass really) that served no purpose other than to be a conversation point for virtually everyone in the restaurant. The food as I said was exceptional. \u00a0Being that the tasting menu probably varies, I won't go into details, but the sauces were amazing and everything was cooked just right. \u00a0The breads they served were really good as well. \u00a0I saw some of the other reviewers also mention the bacon and caramelized onion bread, which is well worth trying. In my opinion, good bread is hard to come by. \u00a0They did well with the bread. We were looking forward to a dessert that we had read about on line. \u00a0They didn't have it on the menu, but prepared it for us anyway. For the week that I was in London, The Ledbury was almost completely full for dinner. \u00a0However, there were a few empty tables for lunch. \u00a0Something to keep in mind I guess. \u00a0It is also apparently fairly close to weekend street markets, which would be a great way to walk off an excellently massive meal.",

I started with the Potato Risotto special that was incredible, including black truffles and other decadent flavors. I chose the Pigeon as my main course and could not have been more impressed. It was a gorgeous display as well. My favorite part of the entire meal was the dessert. I chose the Passion Fruit Souffle with Sauterne ice cream -- I can confidently say this is one of the 3 best desserts I have ever had, quite possibly the best. You MUST order this when coming to the restaurant. The sommelier chose a bottle of wine for us that complimented the entire meal. I would highly recommend visiting The Ledbury.",

    "text": "I have a new favourite, lazy-ass, Sunday activity: three-hour lunch at the Ledbury. It's probably the best, Michelin-starred dining deal in the city. Forty pounds buys you an appetizer, main, and dessert. Of course, we also dabbled in some sparkling rose, white wine, and dessert wine that made the bill a whole lot more expensive, but that's not the point. For starters, we had heirloom tomatoes with goats curd wrapped in phyllo pastry, the rabbit lasagna, and the partridge to start. All were great in their own right... the rabbit lasagna was sublime. Our mains included the grouse, feather blade of beef with ash-cooked veggies, and the lamb shoulder and loin. The preparation of the grouse showed off its intense gaminess, while the lamb two ways illustrated the brilliance that is slow-braising lamb shoulder. The hubs was particularly taken with their cheese trolley. So much so, I think he'll be in the market for his own before long. And as much as I enjoyed dessert the only aspect I can remember were the tasty little morsels knowns as beignets. They may have been served with fruit. The junior som did an excellent job picking a white Bordeaux to go with lunch and chose a separate dessert wine for each of our desserts--all were brilliant in their own right.As much as I love dinner here, I can't help but love the Sunday lunch option so much more. I can imagine it will be just as much fun on a blustery winter day as it was this past beautiful Sunday. Such a great atmosphere! Definitely book well in advance, as being the Ledbury and all, it books up fast. So worth the wait, though!",

    "text": "I have been to the Ledbury restaurant on several occasions, and I have always been very impressed by the food and their overly attentive service.Apart from their regular menu, the Ledbury offers a lunchtime deal (even on Sundays), which is great value for money - 3 courses for less than 40 GBP. The food is inspired by the modern French cuisine, although it is considerably more pan-European than other \"French\" restaurants in London. No wonder then that quite a few of the staff members are French.The dishes are prepared very delicately, and sometimes with a slight trend towards \"molecular cooking\". The ingredients are -as can be expected- first-rate, and often the dishes come with a twist (I remember a dish served under a glass cloche preserving a flavour of smoked hay). The restaurant itself is fairly small, so booking of your table well in advance is strongly recommended. The Ledbury has always been an impeccable dining experience for me and therefore in my opinion truly deserves its two Michelin stars and a top rating in other restaurant guidebooks. Highly recommended !",

    "text": "A truly exceptional dining experience that justifies the Michelin two-star rating and the exorbitant price. From the moment we walked in, the service was welcoming without being overbearing. The menus are small - either a fixed tasting menu or a 70-pound choice among about six starters, entrees and desserts. But that belies the experience... on the 70-pound option, we ended up receiving seven courses without counting two bread courses. What really impressed me was the way they customized our meal. After the server helped us choose among the options that sounded good to us, he also brought us courses of the ones we HADN'T ordered - making the extras conform as closely to our tastes. So we each ended up with an amuse-size plate, three small appetizer-size plates, an entree, a dessert amuse and a full dessert. In total, we tried 10 different dishes, the worst of which was very good, and the best of which were superb. The chef embraces modern techniques without getting lost in the culinary wilderness of molecular gastronomy for its own sake. A starter of scallop ceviche, for example, was accented with roe and frozen horseradish for a cold dish of numerous distinct textures. Accompaniments receive as much attention as the dish's center; crisp boneless chicken wings came with divinely stuffed morels and spears of sweet white asparagus dusted with parmesan breadcrumbs.Proteins are welcome departures from the norm: fresh venison, guinea fowl and John Dory make the menu exciting and fun. Far and away the most expensive meal we ate during a week in London, we left happy, full and absolutely sure we had invested wisely.",

It's more than the ingredients -- it's the way they come together. Seafood with frozen horseradish, ribs that had us moaning for more. The service itself was so friendly and made us feel at home even in such a swanky place. We spent the whole night talking with new Australian friend about wine. She poured us glass after glass of surprising and interesting wines I never would have tried myself. Yes, it's worth it. How can food be this good?

I would say, every course, I believe totally 9 there, was delicate. The quail egg was boiled placed in the center of the plate, set like a small nest. The sea bass was right with the balance of crispy in skin and tender in meat. The desert looked like a fruitful tree in the winter with ice cream, pear, cake etc. Just well done! I am not a big fan of meat, which made me a little bit hesitate to compliment the eight-hour made pork and the medium-well pigeon. The services were nice, given that we spent a long night there - of course, you have so much to finish! The waiter introduced each course patiently and suggested the cheese plate before desert (we did not try as we were so full already). The price was reasonable if you think this is a good Michelin 2 star restaurant. More expansive than most of the restaurant I've ever been. So not much to complain. Yes, after all, you are in London, this is a French restaurant, this is Michelin, and you are happy after the dinner, so what else you would expect about the bill! (well, I would be even happier to see a more moderate number though lol)",

Two special fish dishes both cooked to perfection with the most creative combination of ingredients--a grilled mackerel and a saut\u00e9ed sea bass. They're singled out because not many restaurants, even top ones, can cook fish this well and also plated them so beautifully. An olive oil panna cotta was also memorable.

    "text": "Quite simply an outstanding dining experience on every level. Big reputation but zero attitude at this elegant Notting Hill restaurant. The Ledbury lives up to its well earned great reviews beginning with the space itself. Quite small for a 'grand' restaurant, sort of like walking into someone's home with a slightly larger dining space. Approachable staff to ease you through the select seasonal menu. Plus the luxury to sit at your table to enjoy everything from soup to nuts. The food is exquisite. Presented with flair and artistic eye. If it didn't smell so good you wouldn't want to touch it is so pretty. But it just gets better when you bite in. This is definitely the place to go for a special meal to celebrate and the prices reflect that, but don't let that put you off. The food is so good you will find a reason to go back.",

Pellegrino to pair with Two Michelin Stars it was just after 6:45pm that I was seated towards the back of the dining room and with canap\u00e9s arriving even before my order was placed the night started off wonderfully - a quartet of rich bites flooding the palate in preparation for a seven savory tasting offering not a single texture or flavor out of place, the enthralling bitter-meets-funky pigeon dish amongst the best I've tasted this year. \u00a0Undeniably impressed at the two-hour mark despite surprisingly lax service whose 'shared' style never really allowed the diner to connect with the staff it was at the time of the cheese cart that the evening began to decline and although a long delay was finally met by a single staff member who could describe the night's offerings I was no less made to feel like my inquiries were a bother - a similar issue arising when my pre-meal request to add a second dessert was met by a single bite portion of the warm custard toast. \u00a0At this point having sat for a full fifty minutes between the granite and a tartlet that harkened the scent of an upscale \"WC\" it was finally the maitre d' who would approach and obviously sensing my displeasure as I requested the check my grievances were aired - a long apology heavy on excuses followed by the offer of a kitchen tour and waived gratuity offering some condolence as the time neared 11 o'clock - late, though admittedly not quite dawn.",

    "text": "We went with 2 friends for lunch on a Sunday and it's the best value set menu I've seen in London! For \u00a345, you get 3 courses, an amuse-bouche and the tastiest bacon and cheese brioche rolls ever! Ok, to be fair, there were other roll choices but that one was stunning. They were lovely too, and kept coming back with them. I think I *may* have had four .... We didn't opt for the tasting menu this time but from what we saw on your neighbour's table, it's worth a trip back for.It was quiet when we arrived it had just opened so there was a few minutes of quite-awkward when there were more staff than diners. That soon changed as every seat was filled and the place was buzzing, in a reserved way.The service was impeccable, as was the sommelier. When we asked her to note down the bottle of wine we had, she came back with the label enclosed in a lovely envelope with a handwritten note. Definitely a nice touch. All the food was fantastic, especially the brown sugar tart. For one of us, who wasn't a big fan of desserts, this went down like a charm. We also opted for the cheese selection which didn't disappoint. The plate catered to our tastes but we were also introduced to a few new cheeses. The Chinese water deer was also stunning and when we asked for more detail (specifically about the bone marrow), the servers were able to answer them all! With only one sitting at lunch, we didn't feel rushed at all. I'd definitely recommend The Ledbury as it can cater to a lower budget (but for a special occasion) or you can splash out too! It's not as stuffy as some other Michelin starred restaurants I've been to but it was very professional and smooth.",

The restaurant is beautiful and chic, but it was a little too quiet. That's one thing that I don't like about fine dining; people take it so seriously that they forget to have fun during the experience. Other than that, it was lovely. Wine list was a little limited, but the choices were still nice. I wouldn't necessarily say it should be in the top 10 of the world's 50 best restaurants, but maybe I should go back again and give it another try.",

But I must say food is great but not impressive ... All dishes are executed perfectly and tastes great but some dishes have been there for a bit too long such as flame grilled mackerel with shiso... I know it tastes great but I first tasted this dish back in 2009.... What makes this place 3 star instead of 2 is service.., it is okay but but hit and miss and I had a waitress Shirley who was horrible to us (beyond not warm)... \u00a0My chairs get kicked it touched throughout a meal and no one bothers to stop to apologise or recognise it...Pitty but think it is loosing its plot as it is so popular.., best to avoid if you have been there before.

    "text": "Undoubtedly one of my favourite restaurants in London. Brilliant food combined with top-notch service that isn't overbearing or patronising which seems to be the unfortunate norm in certain fine-dining restaurants. The set lunch menu at \u00a335 is a steal for the quality of cooking. The dishes are in essence a simplification of tasting menu dishes with some substitution of ingredients. Venison was in season when I visited - my muntjac and juniper confit was to die for. As a main, the fillet of brill infused with bergamot served with oat-crusted mussels was fantastic. The fish was crispy on the outside but so tender once you cut through...I definitely cleaned the plate. For dessert, we were absolutely torn between passionfruit souffl\u00e9, banana galette, and the rhubarb mille-feuille. The maitre'd decided to choose for us...and we ended up with all three desserts! The souffl\u00e9 came with sauternac ice cream which complemented the lightness of the passionfruit nicely. The caramelised banana galette with peanut butter ice cream was rich but extremely satisfying. The rhubarb mille-feuille was surprisingly light and not too sweet.Petit fours were simple and innovative - such as the bourbon chocolates. Two and a half hours later, when the bill arrived, we noticed that they had only charged us for two desserts to our surprise. The restaurant is simple, and inviting with attentive service. Seriously, nothing but praise from me and definitely deserving of its 2 Michelin stars. PS: Make sure you try the warm, fluffy and delicious bread. The bacon and onion rolls are seriously addictive.",

    "text": "The Ledbury is one of the best fine dining experiences in London. We went big and splurged on the tasting menu and wine pairings. At \u00a3155 a person, it's certainly pricey but not outlandish for a 2 Michelin star restaurant. What followed was an impeccable 9 course meal. Each and every dish was a work of art. The colorful \"confetti\" duck course even looked like a Jackson Pollack painting (see pic!). My favorite however, has to be the flame grilled mackerel---one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever had. As I'm not a fan of oysters, I substituted a seared scallop in brown butter with baby broccoli for the Chantilly of Oysters---I'm glad I did, the scallop was delicious. The truffle toast that accompanied the buffalo curd was also a standout. The only dish that was a bit lacking was the dessert---a galette of bananas in salt caramel. Bananas for dessert...come on Ledbury you can do better than that! The wine pairings were amazing and really a must have as they do wonders to bring out the flavors of each dish. Service was well choreographed as you would expect though a bit stiff. Our reservation was for 9:45pm, and since the Ledbury was running a bit behind they gave us complimentary glasses of champagne for the 5 minute inconvenience. There is no bar (or even a proper waiting area) at the Ledbury so arrive promptly on time and definitely not early. \u00a0With our late booking time, having 9 courses meant we literally closed down the place---we left at 1:30am! The wait staff became a lot more casual and cheeky once all the other patrons left, leaving my 3 boisterous Australian dining partners and I to have an extra class of port to close out the experience.",

Im relieved that I've found a place that I could always rely on for impressing people who want a great culinary experience. Booked more than one month in advance for lunch because dinner timings were no longer available. I've never been to the restaurant before so was surprised to find it to have normal Victorian housing as its immediate neighbour. Entering the restaurant felt like entering someone's home, it was intimate but also comfortable and it's like all the diners are someone you know. Our waiters were very attentive. They were quick, efficient, courteous and they were good enough for me to be swooning over them where I could catch their attention with a flick of my hand like I'm some character from a James Bond movie. Normal restaurants would have me waving my hands wildly, desperate for the attention of the waiters but noooo, this is the Ledbury and they make you feel very, very important. :)For me, the food was on par with my expectations and the pricing was very reasonable for a Michelin starred restaurant and one thing I'm happy is that they don't charge for us the extras they give us , i.e., the little horse-radish appetisers, bread, water and petit fours, which some restaurants do that I find super annoying and bordering on evil. So I'm super happy that I went to the Ledbury and if I have the chance i will go to the Ledbury again whenever I am back in London. (I moved back to a location that Yelp won't let me update - probably doesn't exist) Everything was so delicious and I was so happy throughout my meal that I felt like I was in cloud nine. Also, the toilets were amazing there was Aesop hand soap and hand balm available which is a brand that I love because it targets dry skin. *happy sigh* I love you Ledbury! I hope no one counts how many times I've written the word \"happy\" in this review. I don't need a thesaurus. PS: whenever you're feeling down from bad dining experience and/or bad service, go to the Ledbury to feel better again!Tl;dr: recommended restaurant. Please go!",

But in Brett's view, it is still work in progress, he continually seeks as to how the place can be improved and I absolutely salute his willingness and determination. On a final note, I would recommend the tasting menu over the a la carte, because for a little more, you would be able to experience the full package of The Ledbury and one not to be missed.",

Every dish was delicious it is even hard to remember specifics and on top of that we got SIX deserts. All included in the price above. Portions are small but when you get to the end of all dishes you can barely walk. The restaurant is located in quiet Notting Hill and there is no bar area so it is better to arrive on time otherwise there is not really anywhere to wait. Special thank you to the staff from sommelier to all our waiters everyone was absolute amazing!",

His wine pairings were also spot on.The entire service team was very relaxed and did a great job balancing the high standards of service while having a sense of humor. Some of the best and certainly the most fun service I've received at a starred restaurant.Here's the menu we had:macaron of beetroot and foie gras  chestnut/truffle soup  Flame Grilled Mackerel with Cured Mackerel, Avocado and Shiso  Ceviche of Hand Dived Scallops with Seaweed and Herb Oil, Kohlrabi and Frozen Horseradish  \"Risotto\" of Squid with Pine Nuts, Sherry and Cauliflower  Celeriac Baked in Ash with Hazelnuts and a Kromeski of Wild Boar  Loin of Sika Deer Baked in Hay with Root Vegetables, Chocolate Malt and Homemade Sauerkraut  Pyrenean Milk Fed Lamb with Baked Jerusalem Artichokes and Winter Savory Milk  Crapaudine Beetroot Baked in Clay with Smoked White Balsamic Emulsion, Goats Curd and Herbs  Goats Cheese Tortellini with Date Pur\u00e9e, Beurre Noisette, Almonds and Artichokes  deep-fried quail's egg, with Jerusalem artichoke puree and shaved autumn truffles. Cheese  Raviolo of Rhubarb with Buttermilk and Hibiscus  Highlights were the deer, the ceviche of scallops, the \"risotto\" of squid and the celeriac baked in ash, but there weren't any courses that I didn't enjoy.The Ledbury was the highlight meal of my London and it definitely deserves the second Michelin star it received this year.",

Beautiful restaurant, great ambience, perfect service, wonderful food.The set lunch is only 27.50 (extremely cheap for a 2 michelin star based in Notthing Hill).Is not really easy to find but you can ask around, anyone knows it!The food is heaven, beautiful presentation, great textures and combinations of flavours: simply genius (the frozen horseradish with my scallops was awesome, it looks like greated parmesan and when you eat it you have the cold sensation at the beginning followed by proper horseradish taste milded by the very cold temperature).Words are not enough, i'll never be able to describe how good it is, you have to experience it.Don't miss out the Passion Fruit souffle' with sauternes ice cream.The wine list is very good as well, world wide choice, with great names and vintages as well as affordable easy options.

It might seem expensive, but compared to other restaurants in its class, it is very cheap. After the amuse bouches, our first course came in. The tomato and lobster salad was spectacular. It was very tasty, and had the perfect balance of textures. This was the best dish there, and probably the best dish I've had out of all the restaurants I've been to. Second was pollock with watercress and truffles, which was better that the third dish, lamb with carrots. The final dish, the tart with raspberries and basil, was my least favorite. It was very good, but I didn't \u00a0think it was special. I did like the basil ice cream on top though. The service was excellent. They let us go into the kitchen, where the sous chef gave us a free scoop of ice cream. Overall, the ledbury was a very good experience. I would recommend it if you live in london or are visiting london.",

I know this is London, but are these prices really necessary? The set lunch is a good deal but the evening menu is just greedy. And, I regret to say, a suckling pig dish I had was disappointingly dry; this can be avoided by proper slow-roasting and making sure it's moist and juicy when it's plated. The diners are also crammed just that tiny bit too close together. Still, if you want upscale stuff, this is one of London's finest, I suppose, or at least it thinks it is. Oh, and another annoying thing, the cheese waiter knew nothing about cheese. He just named them and said that they were good. Compared with the cheese genius at Wild Honey, this is disgraceful, given the prices and the hype.",

    "text": "I get there on time. Even early. I'm not sure the world isn't coming to an end. They show me immediately to the table and I ask for a vodka gimlet (say that with a soft g!) and then Meg gets there too. Unfortunately since we've arrived separately we never hear the specials, which is actually ok since the regular menu is hard enough to choose from. It's prix fixe. Big open room and on a Tuesday night not completely packed, but the patrons are weirdly congregated around the edges. Lovely recessed lighting punctuated with low spots and weirdly beautiful chandeliers. Lots of windows with heavy luxe drapery (black with blacker embroidery) combine with tables covered in white tablecloths to give the room a real feeling of luxury. The patrons are an interesting group, mostly 35-ish and older, mostly couples. There's one younger couple that appear to be on the let's get engaged date but they're a course or so behind us so I don't get to see the outcome of that. Staff is clearly professional \u00a0not a lot of I'm doing this while I work on my degree here. They all had responsibilities for different parts of the meal/service so I think we saw everyone in the restaurant at our table at some point. The hostess, who was also in charge of close-of-meal stuff (petits fours and bill). The order-taking drinks and lead waitress, who described some of the courses. The sommelier, who described some others of the courses. The bussers and food runners, who described some the rest of the courses. All very good but I do admit I like having someone in charge of our table to rely upon. I liked that, despite the quantity of food you'll read about below, I left not completely stuffed, as the portion sizes were very reasonable given the whole of the menu. On to the food On the table: mini salt and pepper grinders (I think \u00a0we never used them as everything was perfectly seasoned) which are even better than last week's s/p wells. Drinks: Vodka gimlet with a lime rind garnish \u00a0a little sweet for my taste (when I make them at home I use just straight lime juice rather than Rose's) but I think it's made to contemporary recipe standard. Hendrick's martini with (bar) olives \u00a0Meg wanted a place like this to serve it with nicer olives instead of the Oscar Meyer of olives. Canap\u00e9: spiced flatbread with pate mousse piped on in two long snakes. Water: we're the only people in the room drinking tap, as far as I can tell. When we ask for it, our water goblets are removed leading me to fear we're going to get kiddie cups but eventually the goblets come back filled with icy tap water and a couple of lemon slices, and are kept filled all night from a pitcher also holding lemon slices. Definitely passes the tap water test. Wine: The list is really a book. Too much to choose from, so we ask for a recommendation. The sommelier knows most of what we've ordered and takes Meg's we like Cabernet Franc suggestion and flips through the book. He comes up with three different suggestions, all under \u00a340 \u00a0quite a feat when you consider that about a quarter of the book is in that price range. We settle on Domaine de la Chevalerie Busasrdieres Bourgueil (1998 ) which he says is quite different. On this we concur, but overall find it to be too fruity for our tastes. Amuse: Courgette puree w/parmesan creme and sourdough croutons. Delicious. Bread: a basket of choices: bacon and onion brioche (Meg), sourdough (Megan), brown roll with black pepper (neither). Meg likes the brioche, I find it a bit much. I like the sourdough, especially with the addition of a little butter \u00a0served in a cylinder on marble with a small sprinkling of sea salt on top. Apps:Terrine of Foie Gras and Pain d' \u00e9pices with Mango and Cabernet Vinegar Caramel. Meg goes for something I don't like. I try a bite but, nope, still don't like foie gras. Nothing more to say here. Scallops Roasted on Liquorice with Fennel, Cepes and Roasting Juices. Liquorice is used like a skewer to make scallop lollipops. Very meaty and flavourful. Mains:Confit Suckling Pig with Spiced Peach, Salsify and Ham Beignet, Baby Onions Pickled in White Beer. Meg goes for bacon for dinner. The peach is quite amazing, and the baby onions are really sweet. New Season's Lamb Roasted in Balsamic with Spinach Pur\u00e9e and Aubergine Glazed with Miso and Garlic. I generally consider aubergine to be a reason not-to-order but the seasonality of lamb win me over. The dish arrives with both the regular bits of the lamb and sweetbreads in the form of pancreas. One of my clients at work is a diabetes product, and they try to be all science-minded so I look at pictures of pancreases (pancreii?) all day so this bit is fascinating. It's really rich tasting. The juices are definitely a hit. Aubergine is roasted so much I thought it was a banana/plantain, and it's actually nearly that sweet, so better than expected. Spinach puree is a little flat but with the addition of the juices and/or lamb I'm quite",

    "text": "Notting Hill or Berkeley Square? For a long time, I had wanted to eat at either The Square or The Ledbury, the two sister restaurants owned by Philip Howard and Nigel Platts-Martin. The Square has held 2 Michelin stars for some time now, and has received consistently high praise over the years, while The Ledbury received 1 Michelin star in its first year of operation and a 'rising star' in last year's guide. The Ledbury is also much closer to my neighborhood, so finally I managed to get there a few weeks ago before heading off to the US for a week or so. The Ledbury's kitchen is run by Brett Graham, a native Australian, who was voted the UK's 'Young Chef of the Year' in 2002. After 3 years at The Square, he was given the green light to open The Ledbury in Notting Hill. After reading about him and his food on other blogs (i.e. here), I was fairly eager to try his cuisine, which seemed to be quite technical and colourful, with a modern Aussie flare. As I don't have any more new and interesting information about the chef, I will end the background information here! Inviting interior, warm welcome We arrived at The Ledbury bang on 7 o'clock, just as it began to drizzle outside. The restaurant was relatively empty, and we were greeted warmly by the hostess, who looked like she was a true professional who had been doing this for a while \u00a0a good sign. As she showed us to our table, which was along the back wall of the restaurant, I found myself being very pleasantly surprised. You see, I have looked at the restaurant many a time from the outside (perusing the menu and the exterior dining area as I tried to walk off my Ottolenghi calories \u00a0there is a branch just down the street toward the Westbourne Grove end of Ledbury Road). You can't really see too much of the interior from the street, and I had thought it might be a bit too stuffy and cramped inside. Quite the opposite. The dining room is light, modern and very tastefully done, in shades of whites and dark grays. While it is a fairly small square-ish room (no pun intended), it doesn't feel confined, and the ambience is very welcoming and airy. There are also nice little touches, such as individual, subtle black stone sculptures on each table, which look different depending what angle you look at them from; various iterations of similar design patterns upholstered on each chair; tastefully done curtains; and antique-style mirrors. We were next welcomed by John Davey, who runs the floor (and who I believe was also formerly Ma\u00eetre d' at The Square), who is a charming middle-aged Irish man who has spent a good deal of time in France in his day. We had a very nice exchange with him, which continued throughout the evening, and then focused on the task at hand \u00a0deciding what to eat and drink. To my surprise, we avoided the normal tiff of whether or not to try the tasting menu at a restaurant we had never been to, as Mrs. LF seemed very keen on trying it, which is not usually the case. I was all ears, and decided to go for the wine pairing, which we would share, as one of us still had to drive home later on! A good start The restaurant was beginning to fill up, but was still fairly empty, which was good in the sense that the waiters and waitresses were very focused on us. At this point, we were brought a large tray of 4 or 5 types of bread, which were still warm and of good quality. Canap\u00e9: Foie Gras & Crisp Flat Bread We were then brought a very intriguing looking nibble to start on, which was a foie gras mousse arranged in toothpaste like fashion across some homemade crispy flat bread, with micro-crumbs that the waiter and Ma\u00eetre d' both confirmed to be Pain d'\u00e9pices (roughly translated as ginger bread in English), though we still weren't sure this was correct. But it was a real hit and we were really looking forward to the next 'freebie' instalment. 8/10. Amuse Bouche: Raw Tuna, Yogurt & Tomato 'Roe' \u00a0so clever! Moving from strength to strength, the chef's amuse bouche raised the bar again for this meal (which hadn't even technically begun yet). The tuna, yogurt and croutons worked well together, with the yogurt being particularly very fresh and tart. But the best thing about the dish is that the part which looked like fish roe was actually tiny droplets of tomato essence. We had to confirm with the staff that our taste buds weren't crazy (we couldn't understand them when they described the dish the first time, and it certainly looked like roe), and were glad to know we weren't incorrect in tasting a very intense tomato gel\u00e9e. It was a very clever and very delicious little bit of visual trickery, and the taste of those droplets escalated the dish to another level. 8.5/10. Course 1: Flame Grilled Mackerel with Cured Mackerel, Avocado and Shiso This was an interesting dish mainly due to the fact that both I and Mrs. LF are more used to eating marinated mackerel in the typical French fashion. This however was a grilled mackerel, and it was cooked very well, with",

And 2.5 hours later, I finally ate my last bite, and 2.5 hours is actually pretty quick too for this type of meal.And with the tasting menu here is what I had for that evening:Amuse BoucheSalad of Heritage Tomatoes with Goat Cheese, dried olives and green tomato juiceFlame Grilled Mackerel with avocado, celtic mustard and shiso.Hampshire buffalo milk curd with Saint-Nectaire, truffle toast and a broth of grilled onions.Dover sole with a herb milk skin, roast cauliflower, mussels and mousserons.Pork cheek with peas, ham and liquoricePortland hogget with wild garlic and an Aubergine Glazed with Black sugar.Saddle of Berkshire Roe Buck with White Beetroot, Red wine lees and bone marrowPre-dessertWhipped ewes milk yoghurt with wild strawberries, lemon verbena meringues and warm ctirus beignets.My favorites included the saddle of Bershire Roe Buck (deer). It was a nice and tender, and not too gamey. yelp.com/biz_photos/bEma\u2026And the dessert was a great way to finish the evening. Combination of sweets and tangy from the many fruits was just right. yelp.com/biz_photos/bEma\u2026And that beignet was nice, fluffy and warm too.I was pretty much pub crawling right before I got here so I had to forego on the wine pairing because I was pretty hammered coming in. So I only paid \u00a3105 for the tasting menu. Now that's a pretty good deal especially for a 9 course meal.This dinner was a great way to start off my trip in London. Make sure to book your reservations in advance.Michelin: 2 stars in 2012. Jacket preferred.",

    "text": "The Ledbury would probably rank as my most favorite restaurant in London, higher than Alain Ducasse and other Michelin-starred restaurants. I would highly, highly recommend this restaurant. I just can't understand why this place only has 2 Michelin stars.The ambiance is perfect - fun and casual but still very classy. The service was impeccable. There were 5 of us in our party, and one person was vegetarian. Oftentimes, the lone vegetarian can feel left out or neglected, especially at a fancy restaurant. In this case, some of her dishes looked so amazing, it was us carnivores that felt left out. The staff was amazingly friendly. The sommelier took her time to go into depth explaining her wine recommendations, and shared some fascinating history about the wines. She clearly knew her stuff. Most importantly though, the food was amazing. Every dish is prepared to perfection, and beautifully presented. We ordered from the a la carte menu. My meal included: 1) Shrimp crackers served on enamel-glazed branches, to start2) Toasted brioche with cheese and carmelized onion as our amuse bouche3) Foie gras puff with liquified foie inside. Ah-mazing4) Sunflower puree on a sunflower and chickpea cracker5) Hampshire buffalo milk curd with truffle toast and a broth of wild mushrooms. This was so delicious. One of the evening highlights. The aroma of the truffle paired with the mushroom broth was unbelievable6) Hand dived scallops \u00a0- Tender and delicious, though I wish I had ordered the Flame Grilled Mackerel. I tried a piece off of my friend's plate, and that was out of this world7) Belted Galloway Beef Fillet and Short Ribs, with salt baked turnips, padron, and garlic8) Clover custard with plum juice9) Caramelized banana with peanuts and passion fruit. A perfect dessert to cap off a perfect meal",

    "text": "This is definitely one of the best meals I've had in a long time. \u00a0I went with some harsh critics, and they felt the same.We opted for the tasting for \u00a3120 (so reasonable!) vs the 4 course for \u00a3100. \u00a0We wanted to be able to try more.Their wine selection is very broad. \u00a0We started with a champagne that they helped us pick, which was perfect with the first part of the meal. For the second half, we did a red from Southern Rhone, which was actually perfect with the meats we had.Canap\u00e9s:- Seaweed crisp with smoked mussel cream: the smokiness was really good- Guinea fowl puff with mead jelly - Deer dumpling: fried with jam, not gamey at allDinner:1. Artichokes salad: violet and Jerusalem artichokes with pear and grated frozen foie gras. The first time I had the shaved frozen foie was at Momofuku Ko in NYC, and then I've had it at some other places, but most places overdo it. Ledbury had just the right amount on the plate, and the dish was very well balanced2. Bread: sourdough - crusty and warm with a dense chewy inside. It comes with whipped goat whey, and it's amazing with some salt and pepper 3. White beet root: baked whole in salt and clay so that it steams and is super tender, and it's then peeled and sliced thinly. Underneath is a small amount of caviar smoked eel, which is amazing. Apparently, they take broken eggs of English caviar and mix it with Cornish sea salt. That eel reminded me of ham in a wonderful way and was a nice surprise at the bottom of the plate4. Warm Bantams Egg: with celeriac, arbois, dried thinly sliced ham, and lots of truffles. Truffle often overpowers things, but it was perfect in this dish. It smells amazing when they set it down, and the egg is perfectly runny. There are lots of textures and colors, and I wiped up every last bit with the bread5. Roast scallop: the scallop had a nice sear and was very tender inside. It's a nice change from the classic scallop with cauliflower puree - I really liked the buttery roasted cauliflower pieces and that bonito butter6. Pork jowl: super tender, with chanterelles and carrots. We were supposed to have the aubergine, but it was a component of the lamb dish, they switched out this course for us7. Lamb: it was initially going to be a muntjac, but they were very understanding about how most of us did not particularly like venison. The lamb chop was slow cooked and very tender, and the neck had tons of flavors. In the center was the white aubergine glazed with miso and Darjeeling tea, topped in black olive bits. It reminded me almost of a Chinese black bean sauce but more subtle and refined8. Cheese plate: We had 5 pieces off the cart and it was a good amount for us to try. It was technically one portion, so they charged us only \u00a310 for the plate (total, split among 4 of us). It came with walnuts, caramelized figs, and crackers. I particularly liked the cheddar and the blue cheese9. Whipped buttermilk with coconut and marshmallows, raspberries, and a raspberry donut: like donuts and cream but very light tasting 10. Brown sugar tart: the crust and top added texture, and I liked the ginger ice cream with it a lot to add some spice. It also came with muscat grapesTo finish:- Juniper caramel sticks - Eucalyptus chocolate truffles- Earl Grey and lychee pate de fruit They went way beyond the call of duty for service. For example, they inquired where else we were going on this trip, and they brought us individualized printed recommendations for restaurants and places to visit elsewhere in the UK. \u00a0Then, one of the servers noted I was taking note on everything and brought me a list of the cheeses we had in case I didn't catch them all. \u00a0Everyone was on point in terms of the timing of when they set dishes down, how they set our dishes, etc, but it was not a stuffy atmosphere at all.I made the reservation at 9am London time on the 1st of the month - the month prior to our dining month. It was worth the trouble of figuring out Open Table logistics. \u00a0I would happily come here again and again. \u00a0I'm not quite sure why they don't have 3 stars yet because in terms of concept, execution, impeccable service, wine selection, and especially price, they could beat most other 3 star Michelin places I've been to.",

    "text": "When we went to The Ledbury, it was number 20 in the world. Given its high ranking, I had high expectations for the meal. It was also a really warm day, and even though the Yelp listing says the dress code is \"Dressy\", there is no dress code, and they did not blink and eye when we rolled up in our shorts after being out in the hot sun all day. (Even the Telegraph quotes the chef saying shorts are okay in the summer.) The venue itself is very nice looking and the servers are quite dressed up, so you can see how people would like to dress up for such an experience (most of the dining room were, but some were much more casual).My partner had got me a voucher for my birthday, so we had the 8 course meal with wine pairings. We also started with a glass of champagne to have with the snacks. The snacks were pretty fantastic actually. Really holding up to the expectations I had. The deer dumpling was amazing, but the guinea fowl puff with mead jelly was the star. The first course was candied beetroot and eel, and it was really wonderful. It was definitely a \"wow\" course leading us to believe things were going to really be fantastic.Unfortunately, there was only one more \"wow\" course, the duck egg with truffle. Because you can never go wrong with that. The other courses, they were just nice. Nothing was wrong with them, but nothing outstanding either. The shaved foie gras should have been great, because foie gras, but unfortunately it was a letdown. Also I had about one and a half almonds in mine while my partner had about 10. That sort of thing is just really not what you would expect at a two-Michelin star restaurant. Luckily my partner gave me a few of his. None of the other courses were very memorable. Something you could get at any other Michelin star restaurant, and definitely not what one would expect from one of the best restaurants in the world. It just felt lack-luster. Which is unfortunate. Again, nothing was bad with them, just nothing amazing either. The cheese trolley was also a bit disappointing. No real interesting choices and nothing that wowed me. I did like the fennel crisps to go with it though. The pre-dessert was pretty nice, but again, nothing amazing.So it's definitely not a place I think i need to go back to. It wasn't great. It was just nice. The service was impeccable and friendly, so that's always a plus, but given the lack of originality with the dishes, it's not a top world restaurant in my opinion. If you really must do it, go for it, but I think you can find yourself more interesting and better food in London.",

    "text": "An English meal so good on American Thanksgiving that I didn't even miss home.Food: Started with a nice (yet awkwardly sweet) amuse bouche of foie gras foam (very mild) and squid ink on a biscuit. Next we had scallop ceviche with seaweed oil and frozen horseradish. Surprisingly, the cold was a good touch. Cornish turbot was cooked perfectly and plated beautifully. The roast quail with fennel was delectable. For dessert, the sommelier recommended a nice red with the cheese plate we specially assembled. To top it all off, the jelly doughnuts were exquisite.Service: The first whiff of the devotion this place had to fine dining is that they didn't give us coat check tickets - just remembered whose coat belonged to whom. Class. The servers were friendly, talkative, and not uppity at all. Ambience: Elegant yet welcoming decor. Dressy and upscale.Bottom Line: When searching for an unbeatable meal in central London, look no further than the Ledbury.",

We called as soon as booking for our desired date opened and were able to get a reservation over the phone, and subsequently changed it to a lunch booking to take advantage of the set lunch menu, which is \u00a350 for four courses - incredible value for a restaurant of this calibre! We got the wine pairing that was an extra \u00a340, but a great complement to the experience and included interesting wines such as a white from the Willamette Valley, a white from Bordeaux, and a sparkling red. Service was excellent and everything was delicious, beautifully plated, and very unique. I especially liked the pork jowl, which we were told is just like pork belly, but they can skim off all the fat. For dessert, my friend and I split a dessert and a cheese board, and the staff even brought us an extra dessert to celebrate our \"anniversary\"! It was a much appreciated gesture. I really liked that the restaurant was small and felt relatively intimate, especially with its residential neighbourhood setting, versus the larger operations of a place like Dinner by Heston that feels quite commercial.",

    "text": "The Ledbury consistently delivers a quality experience but when it comes to food and service and it has been the same on every visit. I do actually feel a bit bad that I have not written a review sooner but after yet another fabulous visit I felt it was time. We had a fairly early reservation for 18.30 so when arriving we were the second table to be seated. We were promptly seated and immediately someone asked if we wanted an aperitif and who would say no to that. We opted for a glass of champagne each. I opted for the B\u00e9r\u00e8che et Fils and my lovely companion S opted for the Jacques Picard ros\u00e9 champagne. Having tried both before these were safe bets and the B\u00e9r\u00e8che et Fils is in my opinion slightly better than the Picard when drunk on its own while the Picard is a great option with some food. In general the wine list is good but having seen what for example Pollen Street Social are doing with the Coravin (nifty little device that allows you to pour one glass from a bottle, of course not from sparkling) and offering everything by the glass I did feel that the wine list per glass could have been a bit more extensive. That said we had a chat with the sommelier and found some great options for a few glasses each to accompany the food. That brings us in to the food. As this was a repeat visit the expectations were justifiable high but they were no doubt met. No issues with exchanging a few dishes on the tasting menu either so that is nice. The meal started with some lovely amuse bouche that really made me want more. Moving into the proper food we had some fabulous dishes. There was nothing that was average so every single dish was either good or better than that. The highlights included the onion soup with truffle and cheese bread, the heritage tomato salad (so simple yet brilliant) and the pigeon (the only good pigeon is a dead pigeon cooked by the Ledbury...). Desserts were plentiful and as usual when having the tasting menus I always end up feeling as if I ate a bit too much.The service was exactly the way I like it - they are knowledgeable (had some fairly detailed questions about the produce), take the time and also manage to be service-minded yet relaxed. The Ledbury remains one of my favorite fine dining options not only in London but globally.",

They led us to a little alcove that faced into the dining room and provided us the drinks menu. The tiny alcove was cozy but a tad awkward as it faced right into the dining room so we were the voyeurs of the room. The overall service was efficient and friendly but some of the service staff \u00a0could have had a bit more personality. The restaurant manager and the chefs were quite friendly though! The restaurant manager invited us for a tour of the kitchen which was quite exciting.We went with the a la carte option and really enjoyed everything we were served. They have a few different types of bread but the best was the bacon and caramelized onion bread. It looked almost like a cinnamon roll but was flaky and filled with bacon and onion goodness. The amuse bouche items included some sort of squid ink chip and also the courgette soup. \u00a0The texture of the frozen foie was quite interesting and something I have never seen before. I really enjoyed the roasted scallops! The nori gave it that extra kick that really added to the flavors. Both of the entrees were beautifully plated and were delicious as well. For dessert we tried the souffle, some sort of black currant cream dessert and we were also given a complimentary birthday gift of mille-feuille. Everything was so good. Ice cream inside a souffle!

    "text": "My experience at the Ledbury inspired me to write my first Yelp review (which turned out to be more of an essay) Yes, it was THAT good! I was impressed even before we got there...As the story goes, we booked a month in advance before visiting from California. Last minute we tried to switch our reservation from dinner to lunch and they kindly accommodated our request via email.The ambiance was elegant, but not uncomfortably stuffy or over over the top. There was impeccable care placed in the details of not just the dining room, but the entire experience.After being greeted by multiple people, our palates were welcomed with a rich amuse bouche.The service was orchestrated seamlessly, with someone delivering you your choice of hot bacon and caramelized onion brioche, or fresh sourdough or spelt roll. Normally, I'm not one to indulge in much dairy, but the fresh butter served with the bread was divine, no doubt sourced from somewhere special.Had the green bean salad with toasted macadamia nuts, thinly sliced nectarines and shaved foie gras to start. YUM! The beans were cooked perfectly, the portion was the right size and I've never had anything quite like it. The richness of the foie rolled over my tongue for the entirety of the dish, without overdoing it.I opted for the scallops which was listed as a starter, but they offered to serve it as a main. Oh. My. God. Each gigantic scallop was cooked to perfection and served in a beautiful artistic arrangement.I don't think I've had better scallops in my life. The accompanying sauce was light but full of flavor, a perfect complement to the well executed sear.Ended lunch with a trio of sorbets- mango, peach and apricot. Lovely, especially the peach.My sister had the set lunch with the boudin with shaved truffles and the slow-roasted short rib. I still can't get over intricate each flavor was on both dishes. Both also beautifully executed. Moreover, the set menu was only 30GBP- a steal for the amount and quality of food you get.Highly, highly recommend! You won't regret going out of your way for this experience. Keep ob keepin' on Ledbury!",

    "text": "saturday night dinner review:lovely restaurant, small, very nice staff. Can choose from 6 courses and 8 courses. we took 8 because we wanted to experience as much as we could here. we tried one regular and one vegetarian tasting menu. the food in general was very good. sometimes when you eat something really amazing you get an involuntary smile on your face, happened a couple times here. Not every dish was a success. They had a pigeon dish. Im sure some people enjoy this, but we've been to a few well known places that have prepared pigeon, and it is always a very similar preparation...tastes the same, don't really care for it. its gamey, soft in an unpleasant way, and just have had enough of this on menus. the corn puree at the center of the dish was very tasty though.there was a tomato dish with langoustine oil...tomatoes were very good...didnt taste any langoustine, but just saying it made it sound fun. looked the same as the vegetarian version of the dish.the pheasant egg dish was delicious, might have been my favorite of the night outside of dessert. aubergine....tasted like warm eggplant...was good but nothing memorablescallop...i didnt really enjoy the texture of it. felt rubbery. best scallop we ever had was at le bernardin in nyc. the ledbury scallop didnt even come close to it. cauliflower dish...was very pretty to look at...tasted good...but just tasted like cauliflower the gentleman that came over to speak with us from arizona was extremely nice and pleasant to talk to...out of all the restaurants we visited on our trip, he was the most enjoyable to speak with. some of the other staff at the other restaurants were annoying.dessert...very good. raspberry buttermilk ice cream with fresh berries...very tasty. second dish i dont even remember what it was called, but very good...pictures attached.overall we would definitely come again, and will come again in the future once the pigeon is off the menu. it was expensive but if you are making a reservation here you should know what youre getting into. you will leave very full.",

Each course, and all the in between bites are so full of flavour , it literally explodes onto the palate! What I appreciate too is that the portions are sensible, not too much! The wine list is comprehensive and the sommelier friendly and helpful... And that's a trait that starts at the top from Brett, the chef and owner who despite his extraordinary success is down to earth, relaxed and humble... None of that Michelin starred superiority here... It's all about the food! It's a pity to see people turn up in jeans here, the food deserves a bit more than that! I'd love to see a candle on the table too, but it doesn't distract from the incredible experience of the 'art' on the plate!",

    "text": "Wow, I loved absolutely everything about this restaurant. \u00a0After one visit it has instantly vaulted to the tops of my \"must return\" list. \u00a0Everything was absolutely spectacular - the room is lovely, the food was stunning, the wine unique and delicious, and all aspects of service were tremendous. \u00a0If 6 stars were an option I would go there for The Ledbury.Let's start with the room - subtle and sophisticated, the noise level is perfect and the arrangement of tables has sufficient distance to allow you to focus on the food and your dining companions. \u00a0It also enhances the flow of service (more on that later).The food was not only delicious but extremely creative in the way it incorporated and referenced indigenous British ingredients. \u00a0If the UK had had Chefs like this years ago it would not have developed it's previously well deserved reputation for bad food and warm beer. \u00a0We can definitely put a stake in the heart of the bad food part.Our tasting menu was:* Chantilly of Oyster - Tartare of Sea Bream with Frozen English Wasabi (with all the sharpness removed from the Wasabi this was a more subtle dish than I'd expected). \u00a0That would be a good precursor for the evening - subtle and sophisticated flavors that do not hit you in the face.* White Beetroot - OMG, so delicious. \u00a0Baked in clay, the beetroot is sliced thin on the mandolin and picks up amazing flavor from the smoked eel. \u00a0The Caviar salt was a revelation and elevated the dish to amazing places. \u00a0I love beets, and this is perhaps my favorite beet dish ever.* Warm Pheasant Egg with Celeriac, Dried Ham, and Truffle. \u00a0A perfectly cooked soft egg which was (shockingly) not overwhelmed by the substantial amount of Truffle in the dish. \u00a0I often find Truffle can overwhelm a dish, but again the Chef's deft touch made this ingredient delicate and subtle. \u00a0Wonderful dish.* Roast Scallop - Blood Orange, Shellfish Cream, and Asparagus. \u00a0Scallop and Asparagus both perfectly cooked (no mean feat, especially getting a large piece of Asparagus to become so tender - I was a little worried when the dish showed up with a tree trunk sized piece of Asparagus). \u00a0But let's face it, I could eat that Shellfish Cream and Blood Orange pieces by the bowl full. \u00a0Wow.* Jowl of Pork - Hispi Cabbage, Juniper and Cracking. \u00a0Similar to pork belly the jowl had a lovely (and again delicate) flavor and an excellent crust.* Aged Pigeon - Quince, Red Leaves and Vegetables.* Passionfruit Curd - again with the subtlety. \u00a0Passionfruit is usually an ingredient that hits you over the head with tartness. \u00a0This curd was subtle and wonderfully passionfruity in its flavor.* Chocolate - Dark Chocolate Chantilly and Mint - Best chocolate/mint desert ever. \u00a0Surprisingly light and refreshing, an excellent end to the meal.While the food was amazing the service was equally spectacular. \u00a0I often find restaurants can lose points on service gaffes, but The Ledbury's service was so good I'd give them extra points on top of the amazing food.Our servers were quick to gauge our level of desire for interaction. \u00a0I saw them work with each table differently, so clearly there is not just one script but rather an adroit staff. \u00a0They quickly ascertained we were foodie types and we had a running dialogue with our main server and the sommelier on the food and comparisons to other places we've dined. \u00a0Clearly a knowledgeable and passionate staff. \u00a0Everything arrived perfectly, with little fanfare, but with a perfect focus on the description to allow us to enjoy the dish. \u00a0I need to call special attention to the wine pairing and to Seamus, the sommelier. \u00a0He was a delight. \u00a0The wine pairings are composed of many small artisan producers that he had sought out (or in some cases stumbled upon). \u00a0In many cases, we not only learned about the wine we were tasting but got a good story of how he found/learned of it or what unique character produces it. \u00a0Fascinating stuff, once he learned we were an interested audience. \u00a0Plus, the wines were delicious and worked wonderfully with each of the unique dishes we were served. \u00a0Seamus was truly exemplary. \u00a0He helped take an amazing meal to the next level.I am enthralled with The Ledbury, its amazing Chef and staff. \u00a0I can't wait to return.",

I'm never sure if those notes will come across but they definitely did this time. Our reservation wasn't until 9:45pm but the restaurant was kind enough to call me about 30 minutes before our reservation to tell us that our table was just about free if we wanted to come a little earlier, which we did.Upon arriving my jacket was promptly taken and I was given a hook to hang my purse on the table so that I didn't need to keep my purse on the floor. Also, there was a Happy Birthday card for my husband waiting at the table. Super classy.The entire experience was insanely good. We went with the tasting menu and the associated wine pairings for the full experience which did not disappoint at all. I had a bet going with one of the waiters that I could eat them out of their delicious bread, which I did not. But when we left, they gave us a complementary loaf of bread and their special butter with instructions for baking the next day. Hilarious! The staff is fantastic - relaxed attitudes, very friendly, very funny, and I think we kept them entertained too. Absolutely worth the price and I would not hesitate to go back - excellent way to celebrate my husband's birthday.",

I still can't believe I was able to dine in a 2 Michelin star restaurant!Everything about this restaurant is phenomenal, from the space itself to the service, and of course the food! The three of us decided to do the set lunch menu, which included the oyster, sea bass, meat, and for dessert, I had the cheese platter. I still have dreams of the cheese platter! From the very beginning, the whole team made us feel as if they were not just excited for us to be there, but excited to be a part of our dining experience. I think there is something really special about a dining staff that seems genuinely excited to experience your meal alongside you -- and that's exactly how The Ledbury team made us feel. I would go back to the Ledbury in a heartbeat (but I'm so glad I took some of it home when I snagged a bag of their compost!)",

    "text": "Dining at The Ledbury was a huge part of my visit to London. I went for a lunch tasting which did not disappoint. The staff were extremely friendly, personable and professional. I started my lunch with a few amuse bouches. One of them was my favorite bite of the entire meal. It was a reindeer dumpling. It had a light, soft bread-like outer shell with a warm moist filling of meat. To me it brought me to winter, in the mountains and Christmas time. It was served on a beautiful piece of food and fir tree branches. The bread served was simply delectable. There is something about the bread during tasting menus. It sort of brings you to a place of simplicity so that you can dive back into each complex dish. I had the artichoke and candy beetroot dish as my first course. I had issues with a booking so they graciously gave me an extra course and comp'd my beverages. The artichoke was a standout dish with a few different textures including sauce, gelee, and power (liquid nitrogen). The eel in the beetroot dish was distinct, so there was quite a \"fishy\" taste, but again well balanced. Very different from the smoked eel back home. My second course was the warm Bantam's egg. This is another must-try course. It was accompanied by truffles that melted in your mouth and dried ham and chestnuts that gave a crunch. This would be compared to a luxury breakfast dish.My third course was the gamecock which was supposedly shot the day before in Wiltshire. It first arrives smoking straight out of the oven. Not sure how they cook it but it had a distinct smokey smell. The bird was whole, feet still on in a bed of straw and fir tree branches. You get to marvel at how fresh the bird is before it is broken down for your plate. The preparation of the dish is beautiful. The additional elements on the plate make the dish truly dynamic and so cohesive at the same time. The lunch wined down with a raspberry sorbet as a palate cleanser and a light dessert. I feel like the lunch had a great balance of sophisticated cooking, nostalgic bites and local fare. I left feeling like I experienced a balance of dishes that highlighted the cuisine of the United Kingdom with a little Michelin Star twist.",

    "text": "Presented whole prior to carving, the GF was a bit aghast, but did not let on. I was ecstatic. A huge honor, considering it was the first of the season and shot by the Chef himself, I was excited to say the leastWoodcockBrain, breast, thigh, kebab of heart, raisin Gorgeously presented, the breast was not overly gamey. Quite moist, it served medium rare. The thigh had more of a chew and ate like BBQ. The head was butterflied and obviously housed the brain, which was creamy and surprisingly sweet. Macerated raisins and water chestnuts rounded out the dish.We can't forget about the kebab of heart, lightly grilled, with great texture and a surprising sweetness.Cheese Course [15 Pound Supplement = $24.58]We also opted for the cheese course, presented by a wonderful cheesemonger from Brittany, France. Knowing we were Philly, she jokingly noted that there was no cream cheese, but went through the wide selection on offer.We ultimately decided on an all-British feature, including a wonderful burnt ash goat cheese, which was salty, creamy, and smoky. A gorgeous triple creme herbal milk's cheese. A semi-soft cheese not unlike Camembert.And last, we had a blue cheese that was herbal, yet expectedly funky. Candied smoked pecans and honey were paired with the semi-soft and blue cheese, respectively. Rustic crackers were also provided as well. Pre-Dessert Prune granite, cream custardPre-dessert was a prune granite over a cream custard. Light and refreshing - the perfect entry to dessert proper.Burnt CreamChicory, roast pear ice cream, beremeal cakeThe burnt cream ate like creme brulee without the overt vanilla flavors. The beremeal cake was moist and had a nice spice to it. Strands of pear were paired with the roast pear ice cream providing sweet, slightly tangy flavors.Hazelnut PuffsA pair of hazelnut puffs were light and perfumed, with candied hazelnuts on top to provide texture.Nitro Coconut Coconut ice cream A coconut shell housed nitro coconut ice cream within - cold, delicious, and eaten to great effect with the liquid nitrogen. Juniper Pirouettes LimeFinally, juniper pirouettes housed a tangy lime creme to provide a nice bite to end our meal.But that actually wasn't the end! GM Darren McHugh kindly offered to bring us down to the kitchen to meet Chef Austin and the brigade. Heading down the stairs, I couldn't help but snap a picture of the woodcock guarding the kitchen from above.Quiet and immaculate, it's what you would expect from a proper Michelin-starred restaurant. In addition to introducing us to his staff, Chef brought us out a final snack of chocolate and coffee crisp.Chef Austin also revealed that he had just been to L'Arpege and we both expressed our admiration for all that Chef Alain Passard has accomplished, with the simplest of ingredients.And with a final picture and handshake, our experience came to an end. Service as a whole was extremely precise, yet personable and relaxed. I couldn't rate it any higher. The meal was wonderful, with the quality of the ingredients shining through. It's safe to say that while there are more than few restaurants I'd like to try the next time I'm in London, The Ledbury will be a mainstay of each visit.",

All the dishes are very well thought out and the wine pairings work wonderfully with the food. I decided to go with the 4 course meal. They have 3 selections to choose from for each course. My choices were: 1st \u00a0 \u00a0 Wild beet root baked in clay,with smoked and dryed eel. 2nd \u00a0 \u00a0 Bantam egg, truffle, English ham(this wine pairing was the most memorable, \u00a0it was a white French wine made in a Sherry style can't remember the name just that it was awesome!) 3rd \u00a0Aged Pigeon ,with beets (so good!)4th \u00a0Chocolate things with ice cream that has the flavour of fresh herds yummy!I am recalling this from memory finishing writing this in the U.S.A . Want to say that the Ledbury \u00a0is a special place for a special occasion the whole meal for 2 with wine was 450 dollars American \u00a0$ or 300 or so pounds well worth it . I highly recommend it! Be prepared to be surprised by the food and treated great by the staff. Thank you Ledbury for a memorable meal and great exspearance! Will hope to return on my next trip to London.",

    "text": "My first impression of The Ledbury: practically perfect in every way. It was not easy to make a reservation here during Christmas season, but I managed to squeeze one in just before they close. So glad that I did \u00a0and what a wonderful dinner we had!The Ledbury is located on a quiet residential street at Notting Hill. For a 2 Michelin star establishment it has a very warm and intimate ambience. It's moderately sized and very nicely decorated. I love how their lighting is soft but just bright enough, as opposed to most other fine dining restaurants where I literally have to use the candle light to read the menu, and get sleepier as the meal progresses. I never understand why this seems to be the rule for high end restaurants but I'm glad it wasn't the case at The Ledbury. I'm not going to go in detail for each dish because frankly I can't remember all the names, and it'd be an absolute disgrace to put down \"that fish dish with some green sauce on the side\". Check out my photos if you are interested. However, I have to say that every dish was impeccable. Beautifully presented, very well balance flavours, nice texture, and we certainly cleared every single plate. That is quite an achievement because there are 9 dishes! All the dishes came promptly, enough time in between, but never made me wonder where's the next one. Our servers were friendly and helpful. This is definitely a meal to remember and I will return at some point in the future...",

    "text": "Dearest fellow diners, if you have at least a shred of moral dignity worth salvaging, please heed our advice below and opt for any other restaurant. Words cannot even come close to expressing the utmost disappointment of my three lady friends and myself. This is absolutely THE. WORST. EXPERIENCE. EVER we have had in the span of our fine dining lives. In short, we felt debased, dissatisfied and more importantly, discriminated upon. The Ledbury was mindblowingly arrogant, disrespectful, lacking and mediocre in quality - and therefore certainly way overpriced. Plus there was no effort spared at all in redeeming themselves! We travelled to this restaurant for the birthdays of two of our dear friends, to this hugely overrated Michelin restaurant. The offence we took for sure ruined the whole dining experience, but even after a cooling down period (and we ladies know about the importance of this) it remained the unanimous conclusion that we had to share our experience with you all. Service - Worst in London (to say the least, in Michelin restaurants)1. Birthday Cake IncidentThe service throughout the meal had been cursory, towards the end it was the Birthday Cake Incident that was the last straw. To set the scene, the birthday cake my friends brought was a four-layer, beautifully marbled cake. Prior to the meal specific instructions were given to put candles the right way up, so there could be no mistaking the FOUR layers. There was a clear cross-section of it, absolutely no room for error. There are two parts to the Birthday Cake Incident - first, the name of the birthday girl was completely misspelt (along the lines of Amy to Nancy). We were absolutely mortified by this but it can still be forgiven as an honest mistake. After the first mistake was rectified and the candles blown out, our cake took 20 minutes to come back and be served, and instead of the four equal and even slices we asked for, we were served 1/8ths of the cake, each in TWO layers. Who would divide a FOUR-layered cake into TWO layers each and serve cubes of it?? We plucked up our courage and still with Asian meekness, very politely asked after this, and instead of a normal apology you would expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant, the manager had the NERVE to tell us neither he nor the head chef was able to discern FOUR layers from TWO. Not a tiny twinge of guilt for ruining the night for two birthday girls - no, not the high and lofty Ledbury. The reason proffered about the small-cubes portions (disregarding our specific request to just tidily split up the cake into four portions to make life easier), was that we had a 6-course meal before. Rather my first time as a customer to have my specific request completely written off, do enlighten, Ledbury the Best Restaurant in the Whole of UK.2. Blatant, elementary mistakesEach customer is asked about any food allergies or preferences such that the kitchen can make relevant arrangements. One of us would prefer not to have foie gras, and this was sounded crystal clear in advance. The attendant assured us the menu does not consist of any foie gras. In confidence we ate what was served before us, but it soon transpired with dismay that one of the amuse bouche dishes certainly consisted of foie gras! While there was always a cursory rambling description of each dish, we thought we misheard and we trusted too much in the attendants to discover the mistake till it was too late. Whose mistake you ask? If you have a food allergy, perhaps weigh the risks.3. Disregard for OUR tablePerhaps the most infuriating experience was the unmistakeable taste of racial discrimination. We were Asians, and unlike all other tables we noticed, we were not spared any cordial chitchat during our meal. No one seemed to care about how we feel about the food or their restaurant. Further, our requests, albeit small ones such as retrieving a menu and removing a wine glass, took excessively long to be met. Until the Birthday Cake Incident towards the end, we were perfectly civil and displayed all the Asian politeness we could muster. Not reciprocated.Fair points for the brave souls out there-To be fair, the lady attendants were more normal, and we cannot say all the attendants were so very disrespectful. And they added icecream to our birthday cake cubes.The wine list and sommelier were decent, although I wish they might let us finish our glasses before refilling them because some people do prefer that? The birthday card was a nice touch but the birthday girls were not addressed",

Dang it, our meal here was just so downright lovely that it's hard to do it justice in words!!I loved that for such a well-known (and double Michelin-starred no less!) place, the atmosphere is just so relaxed. It's a bright but cosy dining room, and the staff are so welcoming that I felt very well taken care of right from the start (or maybe I was just overly impressed by the engraved handbag hook I was given at the table!). It's fun to people-watch here too - you can spot the regular set mingling with holidaying foodies who've read about it in a 'Best Restaurants in London' list (or yelped it ;). And then there was us, 2 wide-eyed and hungry housemates looking to celebrate a birthday by splurging on great food and wine.That's exactly what we got with the tasting menu. It changes regularly so there's little point detailing what we had, but you can tell the ingredients are high quality and each course had real substance for me - all beautifully presented without any need for the OTT flourishes that you find elsewhere. And ohh baby, the wine pairings. Do it. Don't agonise over the money at this point - if you're there, you may as well do it right!You'll need to break open the piggy bank (or three) for this one, as it's possibly the most expensive meal I've ever had. And yet, after working its very special down-to-earth magic, it's the first place in this price bracket that I can actually imagine coming back to try again. Now if only they'd halve all the prices and I really would be back once a month!",

One thing about the Ledbury is that it's tucked away in a residential area in Notting Hill. The other is that it's smart casual, so not many suits here...mostly locals. Once the Chinese arrive with cameras it'll be over...oh, that's us! :) \u00a0Pics: bit.ly/15e8G5u The decor is a relaxed, but curated vintage look: velvet embossed black drapes, chairs with muted, but unmatching textile designs, plates that change with the courses.

    "text": "They say that lunch is the inferior meal of fine dining. They are wrong. There is nothing inferior at The Ledbury - lunch is incredible. I often enjoy the amuse bouches even more than the apps, and this time it's true. Which is really saying something considering the quality of the apps. There's a dollop of smoked mussel cream on a nori crisp. The nori is light, and the smoky cream has such a silky texture. There's a Guinea Fowl Pate Puff, like a cream puff with meat, and a succulent crab paste with the sweetest tiniest shrimp.Fresh Hazelnuts are a lighter starter - nuts and summer fruit are always a winning combination.The Veal Tartare is so...raw. Gamey but delicate, undeniably delicious. IT come with a hunk of bread topped with beef fat which is basically just butter meaty goodness.The Native Lobster is one of the most beautiful dishes I've ever seen. I love the layers of shiitake on top, and the lobster itself is so tender. The Belted Galloway Beef is a risk because it's for two. The filet is absolute perfection, and just when you think it can't get better, they add a silver-dollar of bone marrow. The short rib is melt-in-your-mouth. I never knew short rib could be so good. Next, a Passion Fruit Mousse palate-cleaner and some fried donuts. Then the real dessert, work-of-art Raspberry Tart with so much amazing sorbet and a Brown Sugar Tart with a fantastic ginger ice cream. Post-dessert, they have Juniper Caramel Sticks that make you feel less grossly full and of course, chocolate truffles. If this is lunch, I MUST return for dinner. The Ledbury is among the best meals I've had in London, and it ranks among my top ten ever. I've had plenty of fine dining all around the world, but The Ledbury is in a league of its own!",

    "text": "This being one of the top restaurants in the world, we had to try it and it def did not disappoint. It is exactly what you come to expect with the Michelin rated restaurant - white glove service, extremely well though out curated food, the best of the best, \u00a0and with stunningly simple Decor and atmosphere. Prior to our arrival, when we made reservations we told them about our dietary restrictions and allergies which this restaurant curated to perfection. There was fresh baked gluten-free bread and entire four course vegan meal including but not limited to a vegan gluten-free ice cream and chocolate mousse which was one of the best hands down that I've had to date, around the world. Each plate was so uniquely different than the rest and even my husband opted to do the vegan meal because of the amazing descriptions listed on the menu. It seemed so enticing and appetizing that this was just the way to go. For a carnivore to enjoy a vegan meal, it takes a lot and this place did not disappoint. It did just that. If you are in the London area, this restaurant is not to be missed. One of the most amazing Michelin rated meals I've had and I highly recommend to anyone with any kind of dietary restriction to try this place. It was truly a magnificent birthday and they made this meal such a special meal and made us feel like we were the only people in the restaurant even though every table in the restaurant was full.",

Most of the dishes I had were bland and uneventful. I honestly didn't see any special care given to the food/service/ambiance compared to almost every other fine dinning experience I have had. The photos on Yelp did not represent anything like the meal I had (which was the tasting menu).The main server I had was nice, but there was another employee who had attitude, which made the dinner less comfortable. I was seated right by the entrance and had a nice view all evening of the servers and workers talking/preparing to serve other tables. It was not a relaxing environment. I also left the restaurant hungry, and literally went to a shawarma place in Kensington afterwards. The management should understand that some customers make sacrifices to enjoy a special meal here, at a steep cost. The food and the service felt perfunctory, it was quite disappointing.",

    "text": "The Ledbury is well known as of the best restaurants in London. With two Michelin Stars and an ever-changing tasting menu, this is a world class establishment with a wonderfully unpretentious ambience. No dress code, and a staff that are as genuinely friendly as they are highly trained. Reservations as far in advance as possible are suggested, as their books fill up quickly. We were lucky to secure a table for two just a few days in advance, thanks to their lovely reservations staff.Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly and seated at a table with a great view of their gorgeous dining room. Romantic soft lighting, high ceilings, and elegant, timeless decor. Luxurious without trying too hard. The wine list was abundant and curated, offering an impressive selection of bottles I had never seen before. The staff sommelier was highly knowledgeable, and recommended a Pinot Noir that we enjoyed. My boyfriend and I each decided to have the tasting menu, which I strongly suggest. They offer a fully vegetarian version for \u00a3140 per person (as opposed to the \u00a3150 pp for the standard menu). The first few courses were not on the menu-I soon discovered that this tasting menu features several mini courses between the actual courses. The first bites that came out set the tone for an incredible meal-savory tartlets served on a warm stone, elegant canap\u00e9s filled with vegetable pur\u00e9e. As each course was brought out, our waiter briefly explained the ingredients and preparation. The meal was not only beautifully prepared and plated, but artfully choreographed.My favorite of the main courses was the White Aubergine Dusted with Olive and Black Tea. The tender eggplant fully absorbed the richly tangy marinade. The two herb infused sauces draped alongside were complex and played well together. I savored this dish, attempting to decipher the ingredients. The Hen Of The Woods mushroom was a close second. Roasted with rosemary, and beautifully presented by the chef, the multidimensional earthy flavors were exquisite. While these courses stood out, all of the others were fantastic as well, ranking among the best dishes I have ever eaten. Do not skip dessert. The dessert (and the pre-dessert) blew us away. Served atop a plate of juniper berries were two delicate rolled cookies filled with a spicy and sweet juniper and ginger sugar that melted in our mouths. Alongside were the most decadent chocolate truffles I have ever enjoyed. The main dessert course, Brown Sugar Tart with Stem Ginger Ice Cream was equally impressive. The wafer thin maple scented tart was filled with a creamy gingerbread spiced mousse, served with poached grapes and a decadent fresh ginger ice cream. Just incredible.I cannot say enough good things about The Ledbury-they deserve more than 5 stars. The tasting menu was not only an outstanding meal, but an experience that my boyfriend and I will not forget. I look forward to returning.",

The chef tasting menu is the way to go - it is an incredible experience. Each course was delicately prepared and displayed imagination and innovation in the culinary arts. There was a sophistication to the dishes. One of my favourite dishes was the Lebury's signature dish where the lobster meat was wrapped with shiitake mushrooms. The textures and flavours were an explosion of the senses. I would highly recommend that you give Ledbury a try. For a Michelin Star restaurant, the prices were on par with other Michelin Star restaurants. Make sure you make a reservation well in advance.",

We've often regretted choosing a tasting menu in the past (there's always a flag in the progression that makes you feel as if you should have chosen otherwise), but the Ledbury's menu absolutely lived up to our expectations.

This dining experience was beyond phenomenal. We made the reservation in November for January 1st. As you could imagine, I sat excited for two months. When we got there it was beautifully decorated. Our coats were taken and my purse was hung. We were seated with the chairs pulled out for us, truly magical.The tasting menu was unique and I loved everything I tried from start to finish. The amazing thing about a tasting menu is that you actually end up being so full. Everything was to die for.Each person came over to ask how everything was and many made conversation about where we were from and what we were doing in London. Definitely a great experience and hopefully not a once in a lifetime one. I will be back!",

I've never had foie gras powdered and it was shockingly delicious. I had a roasted cauliflower (the visual presentation almost made it look too good to eat!) and a perfectly cooked fish. For dessert, I had a strawberry lavender tart that was fantastic too. The BF was happy with his pork and chocolate dessert.

Our meal started with a thin homemade mille feuille (I think was the term for it), with foie gras. \u00a0Delicious flavours and perfectly seasoned.The Ceviche of Hand Dived Scallops with Seaweed and Herb Oil,Kohlrabi and Frozen Horseradish was delicately presented and just an incredible combination of flavours.This was followed by \"Risotto\" of Squid with Pine Nuts, Sherry and Cauliflower. \u00a0Incredibly, the risotto was actually made from thinly cut squid! \u00a0the cauliflower was like shaved parmasan cheese. \u00a0Very creative and beautiful.We were then brought out Celeriac Baked in Ash with Hazelnuts and a Kromeski of Wild Boar. \u00a0The ash was brought out before which is like a cocoon that cooks the celeraic for 24 hours. \u00a0Another triumph.Then came out Roast Cod with Grilled Leeks, Hand Rolled Macaroniand Truffle Pur\u00e9e. \u00a0Again incredible and great attention to detail down to the homemade macaroni. \u00a0This was followed by Pyrenean Milk Fed Lamb with Baked Jerusalem Artichokes and Winter Savory Milk. \u00a0By this point I was starting to get full but still managed to wipe every last globule off my plate with bread!Dessert was \u00a0a beautiful and refreshing jelly (I can't remember what it was).I didn't know such flavour combinations could exist until I went to the Ledbury. \u00a0How on earth a chef can think up such incredible dishes is beyond me and Brett Graham is truly an artist.This restaurant deserves more Michelin Stars!**UPDATE: \u00a0As of January 2010, The Ledbury was awarded a second Michelin Star. \u00a0Congrats and well deserved.",

    "text": "For photos, see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  Within a few weeks after we first moved to London 4 years ago, The Peanut Gallery was researching London restaurants for my birthday dinner. The man does not hold back when it comes to restaurant research, and he hit on a place in Notting Hill that sounded like the goods. And so it was that The Ledbury set my benchmark for London fine dining. It's still my favourite place for a posh lunch or dinner. I've been back twice since - once with friends for the great value set price lunch (at \u00a333.50 for 3 courses) - a terrific way to experience the brilliance while the sun flirts in through the huge surrounding windows. The second revisit was just last week to catch up over dinner with Aussie food blogging friends, Gourmet Chick, Catty and Vintage Macaroon as well as the lovely Claire from Australian wine maker, d'Arenberg. What better place to meet than over the fine food of Australian head chef, Brett Graham, drinking terrific Australian wines kindly contributed by D'Arenberg (thanks Claire) and Katnook Estate (thanks Jo). Jo (who couldn't join us in the end) made contact with Brett Graham, who put together a special tasting menu for us, tweaked to match our wines. Over a bottle of champagne well chosen by the sommelier to meet our request for something reasonably light and crisp, we start with the pretty, mousse-like foie gras canape followed by the amuse bouche - a deep fried quail egg with Jerusalem artichoke puree and shaved truffles. Firm broccoli stem with natural yoghurt and tiny, sweet Falmouth Bay prawns in brown butter and vadouvan (a mixture of onions, shallots and garlic with Indian spices) is one of my favourite courses. This dish highlights the kitchen's dexterity for textures and combining vivid flavours in well balanced harmony. Basically, it's clever, and it tastes brilliant. Who knew broccoli could be this good? We drink the 2009 Katnook Estate Sauvignon Blanc from Coonawarra - a Sauv with body and lots of zesty citrus and apple. A shallow soup bowl is presented next. Across the base is a thin layer of Hampshire buffalo milk curd with uncooked French cheese, Saint-Nectaire. Small clusters of grilled onions and mushrooms are dotted around the plate. At the table, an aromatic, delicate broth of grilled onions is poured over the top and, on the side, waits a toasted brioche topped with large thin disks of earthy black truffle and puree. Again, there are delightfully balanced layers of flavour at work - just gorgeous. With this, we drink d'Arenberg's 2008 \"The Last Ditch\" Viognier from McLaren Vale. It's exactly the type of wine I love. It's been aged for 6 months in French and American oak, and has a lovely, big honey and cream character. Next up, a colourful arrangement of root vegetables, a nutty, sweet and earthy mix, baked in salt and clay with roasting juices, hazelnuts and Lardo di Colonnata (the silky pork fat from pigs having spent their lives feasting on acorns and chestnuts in Tuscany). Oh my. What better way to turn vegetables into pure, indulgent gluttony? Our accompanying 2005 Katnook Estate Cabernet Sauvignon has rich fruit and tannin, but is light enough so as not to overpower this dish. A plump, moist fillet of roast cod glistens beside a mellow truffle puree, cauliflower, parmesan gnocchi and, for some extra umami, sea vegetables. Again, it looks pretty and it's a perfectly executed delight to eat. Finally, the loin of roe deer is baked in Douglas fir (coniferous tree) with beetroot and malt. There's an accompanying venison sausage, which is rich and gamey. The loin is tender and, although I think it lacks some flavour, it's topped with an oozy blob of rich marrow which adds depth. We accompany it with the 2002 d'Arenberg \"The Dead Arm\" Shiraz. This is a big, gutsy Aussie Shiraz, with intense fruit, chocolate and spice. It's a gorgeous match for our rich, autumnal game dish. Before dessert, we cleanse the palate (ok, any excuse) with a tart passion fruit concoction in a shot glass, before finishing with a fantastic, sweet brown sugar tart. It looks like a long slab of foie gras and, praise the lord, is almost as rich. It comes with muscat grapes and a stem ginger ice-cream. Coffees and teas at the end are matched with our choice from a delicious selection of jellies, merigues, macaroons and chocolates. Although we didn't try it, the cheese trolley - or, more accurately, the smell of the cheese trolley - deserves a mention. Fantastic. When it moves about the room, it's like you just wandered into the cheese room at La Fromagerie with your nostrils fully flared. Save room. Service was, as always, professional, knowledgeable and friendly without a shred of stuffiness or irritating fuss. Brett Graham wasn't in the kitchen on the night we ate (he was shooting in Scotland), and so our fantastic meal only goes to show what an all round strong",

    "text": "The Ledbury is a little one Michelin star oasis of sublime French cooking in the heart of Notting Hill. Westbourne Grove is a little treasure trove of wonderful food experiences but the Ledbury is a venue offering a slightly more upmarket experience. I was lucky to be taken there for a belated birthday meal by some good friends from medical school.The restaurant website gives a good idea of the dishes - classical French tradition married to some modern ideas and presentation. The staff were efficient and friendly and people were dressed in a mixture of casual and more formal wear.We decided on the tasting menu which had some unusual dishes on it as well as some old favourites.1. The amuse of tomato essence was an excellent palate cleanser and got the gastric juices going nicely.2. The oily flame grilled mackarel and smoked eel were nicely evened out by the mustard dressing that was sweet, slightly acidic with a little mustard heat to cut through all the richness. A little nasturtium reflected the current trend to decorate plates with flowers.3. The most unusual sounding dish of the day was the celeriac baked whole in ash - this was brought whole to the table to show us before it was sliced. I can see why this was done because the once presented on the plate with the hazelnuts, wood sorrel and pork kromeski, it was so wonderfully tasty and so savoury that I would never have guessed that it was celeriac. An amazing dish in its concept and execution and exactly the reason I dine at Michelin star establishments - they have some dishes that I can't even conceive in my wildest dreams let alone cook them.4. Foie gras :-) \u00a0How can it ever go wrong? :-) \u00a0I prefer mine seared but this was served as a wonderfully rich torchon.5. Brill done in a classical meuniere with some creamed potatoes, mussels and broccoli in a lovely light seafood jus.6. The next unusual dish was muntjac. We had to ask the waiter what this was and it's deer. We were served best end of muntjac baked in hay served with root vegetables, pear and liquorice. I love pear and I love game but would never have put them together. Another genius moment.7. Pre dessert of nice light sorbet.8. Brown sugar tart which was yummy, served with Muscat grapes, white raisin ice cream and vin cotto.The quality of the meal was reflected in the fact that 4 hours just flew by and we had to run to catch our last Tube! A wonderful place for a special occasion.",

    "text": "I was recently introduced to this 2 Michelin starred chi chi restaurant in Notting Hill, which has always been my go to list and has rapidly become one of my top 5 restaurants ever. Most 2 michelin star restaurants are full of pomp and ceremony and are often not a relaxing affair, unlike this beauty in a leafy upmarket st in West London. The restaurant is intimate but buzzy at the same time and is probably a reflection of its' clientele (the well heeled, i spotted a Roksanda Ilinic dress walking around!). The service is excellent. Finally and most importantly it is all about the food here. The food has an Antipodean influence and delivers big flavours subtly. At the weekend , you are forced to eat the tasting menu (only a la carte on the weekdays), which would be my only grumble, i like having a choice. However, the tasting menu blew me away from the beginning with the oh so moreish bacon brioche. The flame grilled mackerel was a crispy, salty morsel of extreme delight ( i don't normally like mackerel). Course after course came in just the right quantities and hit big time taste sensation levels (i felt like shouting bingo at each course.). I cannot fault the meal or the evening, einfach klasse. Not cheap but worth every pound and the distance. I so envy West Londoners who have this gastronomic haven on their doorstep. (monikasays.com )",

    "text": "please also seehungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  A special restaurant for special occasions I was very excited to finally dine at The Ledbury in Notting Hill. (I took RS there for his birthday, lucky guy!) The chef Brett Graham is only 30 years old and has accomplished 2 Michelin stars for his restaurant (for a more detailed description of the chef's CV and some beautiful pictures of the food at the Ledbury I refer you to the excellent post by Cheese and Biscuits). The food is 'modern French' with some interesting twists, I particularly enjoyed the play with unusual flavours which you kind of think can't work together and can't help but order out of curiosity: let me guarantee you however, they do work very well indeed! The atmosphere is exactly right for a special and/or romantic date: it does feel pleasantly posh without being overly pretentious, tables are far enough apart to feel private and to not overhear other peoples conversations and waiters are hoovering around reading your thoughts before you even know you had them without being intrusive. They do have a fair share of French waiters which admittedly adds to the romantic atmosphere. However, I found it impossible to understand their accent, therefore I have missed most of the ingredients in the amuse bouches. They were lovely anyway :) The a la carte menu costs 65 pounds for 3 courses while the tasting menu is 75 pounds. This is really not cheap \u00a0you do get something for your money though \u00a0it feels like a tasting menu even with having only the 3 courses as you get 2 additional amuse bouches as a starter, a pre-dessert and even some chocolate at the very end (before you finally role out the door). We started with Ceviche of Scallops with Kohlrabi and Frozen Horseradish. An interesting looking plate of food reminiscent of a winter wonderland but boy was it good! The frozen horseradish slowly melted onto the thinly sliced scallops while releasing its flavours. Food like this is fun! The Grilled Mackerel with Cucumber did not quite live up to the grand expectations: the mackerel was slightly dry and for me it was ok rather then wow. Also with the mains there was one clear winner: the Lamb with Miso Aubergine. The lamb was so tender and cooked to perfection in a lovely sauce that made you want to lick the plate (I doubt this would have made me many friends there though). And the aubergine!! Soft and with a sweet miso flavour it was absolutely delicious. For me less convincing was the Poached John Dory with Blood Orange, Crab and Asparagus. There was nothing obviously wrong with it, a nice plate of food, but it was slightly one-dimensional and something seemed to be lacking. Then came my favourite amuse bouche to clean our palate \u00a0panna cotta with peach ice cream was a dream and much too small.. As dessert I opted for the Eucalyptus and Gingerbread Souffle with Thyme Ice Cream. The opinion on the dessert was not unanimous: I thought it was perfect. The delicious thyme ice cream melted into the perfect fluffy souffle rich in vanilla/gingerbread flavour with just the slightest hint of eucalyptus. RS said it tastes soapy. Good, so there was more for me! The Cheese Platter was generous: 4 cheeses chosen for us by the French cheese waiter (3 of which we really liked) came with lovely fresh, still warm fruit bread. Cave: they served us the wrong bottle of wine in the beginning (more expensive, surprise surprise!) \u00a0gladly we realised because this would have been an even bigger disaster for my finances However, to make up for it, they invited us to a half glass of very nice French white wine. I forgive easily We had a perfect evening but unfortunately The Ledbury is a challenge for your bank account. However, despair not, they serve an incredibly bargain lunch menu for 40 pounds. For special occasion food I recommend also Launceston Place in South Kensington: I found the food there comparable in taste and quality while their 3 course evening menu is only 45 pounds",

    "text": "We went to The Ledbury in Notting Hill around New Year's Eve and to sum it up: It was absolutely stunning! The Michelin Star is well deserved, with the restaurant providing a small number of maybe a dozen well-sized tables, plenty of space, a lovely decoration and atmosphere, a formidable cuisine and an absolutely delightful staff. We laid our evening's fate into the hands of the chef and decided on the Tasting Menu, a seasonally changing menu with around eight or nine set courses and a suiting selection of wines, providing plenty of variation; especially compared to an usual three-coursed menu. And there truly aren't enough words to describe just how wonderful the menu was. Each and every dish was beautifully arranged, perfectly seasoned, very creative and so well prepared and full of detail, that it was almost a culinary adventure in itself. The staff was just as high-classed as the cuisine: very warm, highly professional, friendly, attentive and polite, there was always someone there to provide us with everything we needed at any given moment. From the elaborate explanation of every course, wine and cheese to little details like the napkins, which were newly folded every time a guest went to the bathroom, the service was truly impeccable. We really felt in good hands and that everyone at The Ledbury wanted us to enjoy our stay as much as possible - and we certainly did. At \u00a3108.00 (including wine) per person, the Tasting Menu certainly wasn't cheap, but definitely worth every penny; especially considering the wide variety of masterfully prepared dishes and the brilliant choice of wines. Our mandatory (sparkling) water was even surprisingly cheap, at about \u00a34.00 per bottle, so that there was no necessity to even consider ordering tap water at all. We really cannot wait to visit The Ledbury again. It was a perfect dinner.",

    "text": "I had a number of friends telling me to dine at the Ledbury. After two months on the waiting list I finally managed to dine there. I went large - the tasting menu. This comprised of 9 different plates all of which were superbly executed. First up was the amuse bouche - a lovely breaded quail's egg with what I think was truffle. A taste sensation. It got even better with the second dish - Chantilly of Oysters, with a tartar of oyster, horseradish and dill - The dish was served in a martini glass and was for me the highlight of the meal. It was like being kissed by a sea monster!Next was a flame grilled mackerel with smoked eel, which came with a lovely celtic mustardFollowing that was Scallops with Fennel, bergamot, and liquorice and good combination of flavours.Next up was Buffalo milk curd, with a thin consume sauce poured over it. Personally speaking this would not be my choice, although it was perfectly executed and had an interest fusion of flavours.This was swiftly followed by celeriac baked in ash, with boar and hazelnuts another highlight. The earthy celeriac worked well with the sweet hazelnut. Another highlight of the meal.The next dish was a fillet of beef that you could tell had been aged for the required length of time. It was like cutting through butter with a hot knife.Having got over the hump of the meal, we had a pre-dessert of what was coconut milk with (I think) a passionfruit jelly.But the next highlight was the mille feuille with rhubarb and clementine leaf ice cream. The ice cream was sensational and unlike anything I've ever tasted. My third highlight of the evening.All in all every meal was perfectly executed and superb. The staff very attentive but without being over bearing. It's worth saying that our sommelier was excellent all evening, giving a passionate account of each wine that I tasted.Expensive yes, but worth every penny.",

The d\u00e9cor and atmosphere were much more informal than I'd expected and the service so efficient that I couldn't believe that we weren't the only ones dining that night. I won't go into detail of the food - suffice to say that each mouthful of the tasting menu was mindblowing. The accompanying wine was a delight and the sommelier pitched his summaries just right. One of the best touches, however, was that we (apparently) had to wait a few minutes more than is usual for our pear and hazelnut dessert. So we were then brought two extra complementary puddings from the \u00e0 la carte menu (brown sugar tart with stem ginger icecream - to die for - and thyme/eucalyptus souffl\u00e9). Awesome.
