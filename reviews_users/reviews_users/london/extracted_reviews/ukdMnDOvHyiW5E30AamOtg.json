Basically, if I want to be sure of having tasty (and authentic) food, delicious cocktails, and a banging good time, then I'll come here. The DJs play awesome sets, and they also have a hilarious band on Wednesday nights that gets the whole underground bar on their feet and dancing. I've not found anywhere else like it in London - and Soho really is the ideal place for it. They serve the best margaritas you're likely to find - seriously, seriously good - and the food has never disappointed. I come back time and again for their beef burritos with a side of cheese stuffed deep fried peppers, or you can share a long tray of tacos and a jug of cocktail which is INCREDIBLE. Also, it's fun to scan the wall of hot sauce and dare each other to try the most interesting ones - and they have loads! Most importantly for me though is the tequila selection. I am a huge fan of tequila and mezcal and El Camion have some of the best around. Plus, you can tell the staff have been really educated and actually care about the spirits they sell, because I've spent more than one night propping up the bar and chatting all things agave with them! Love it, recommend a visit.",

When I got in there I was pleasantly surprised - quite clean and friendly! (Strip joints are so unclean and unfriendly these days.) There was plenty of seating, pretty decent service, and as Andrew points out, a vast array of amusing hot sauces on the wall. I didn't partake in the Qype staff face off but the 100% pain looked fairly viscious! As for the burrito - this is what only warrants 3 stars. Seemed fairly ordinary to me. None of the wonderful flavour and spice you get in some places. All a little neat and tidy too. A burrito is a dirty feed - there should be sauce splashing all over the plate. And ... \u00a37 odd. Bit pricey for a lunchtime burrito. If I want burrito I'll be going elsewhere, although I'm sure this place will do well being on the south side of Soho, el touristo trappo.",

    "text": "El Camino is a new addition to the growing tex-mex scene in London. I have to say, it is distinctly average. It's mainly let down by it's sloppy service - and some of the dishes are so-so. I always get grumpy with paying more than a couple of quid for a tiny pot of guacamole, and El Camino are guilty of this crime. It's so cheap to make - why are you fleecing people for it? The tortilla chips and salsa are also a bit pricey, for what is probably the easiest starter in the world to serve up. Cocktails - we only tried the classic Margarita - but it was well mixed and they certainly did not skimp on the tequila. However, it got served up in the dullest tall glass - where's my Margarita glass with the salted rim? No show-manship on that front.... The corn tacos come in a minuscule sized portion - my friend had to order some more food just to get close to feeling full! The Burritos however are a different story - very tasty fillings, and the portion sizes are just right. I thought the mix of ingredients was well balanced too - and I've eaten my way round a lot of Burritos in London.... What we really did enjoy was the relaxed atmosphere, the kitsch tablecloths and the excellent display of spicy sauces from around the world! What we liked the least was the over-priciness of some items and the slightly lazy service. El Camino will not blow you away from a culinary point of view , but it is a lot of fun. It's definitley a place for friends, cocktails and good times.",

When I asked, the waiter mock me by saying that they would put the music even louder. I ve got so angry I left before ordering. Waste of time, I was starving and I had to look for another place. I am glad I did, the place looked depressing and I am sure the food would have been too. Do not go if you want a good environment and Mex food go to el Chiquito Leicester Square.

    "text": "First let me note that I am from Southern California, but that I've lived in London for more than five years so my scoring is based on more realistic expectations (the bar has been officially lowered). We were initially put off by underwhelming and downright not good salsa and guacamole (my Irish husband was the first to comment so not just me!). But we were pleasantly surprised by the mains which were pretty tasty. My enchiladas could have used a dollop of sour cream with them, but I'm sure I could have ordered it as an extra if I really wanted to. The one thing that was a bit odd was that we wanted a pitcher of margarita which they were fine to do as frozen, but not on the rocks. \u00a0I get that the frozen stuff is ready made and out of a machine, but how hard is it to mix together a pitcher of margarita. But overall, not a bad spot for Mexican food, just don't go in expecting to be wowed and you might want to just go straight for the mains.",

It was nearly impossible to get someone to take our order, and just as difficult to get them to bring the bill, refill our water, or generally check up on us. Given where we were sitting, and the fact that servers could not fail to walk past us at least once every few minutes, I was very disappointed. It was the first place in London where I have not left a service charge.The food was good though, as I say. A bit more Tex-Mex leaning, though we Americans never complain about food that tastes like home.

    "text": "First off, don't confuse this with El Camino. They are a world apart (although fairly close geographically) and depending on the organiser's ability to text accurately you may find yourself in a dingy bar instead of the bright lights of El Camion. My visit to EC was prompted by London Cocktail week as they were offering \u00a34 tequila cocktails and \u00a34 taco plates. A meal and a drink for less than a tenner in the middle of Soho? Sorted. Alas, it was not meant to be.I got there and met my friends which raised our first issue. We have booked a table for 4 and were crammed onto a table for two. Luckily we managed to annex a couple of tables as people left (or perhaps were pushed out by our growing group) and got all 8 of us (quite literally 4 friends wandered by on accident and joined in) seated somewhat comfortably if very cosily. Then we tried to order.I will say the waiter dude was very friendly but he highlighted one key issue. The London Cocktail week deal was only available at the bar downstairs. No worries, I like a good basement bar as much as the next alchie but as I got up to move down, I was informed that there was a tequila tasting going on which was running a couple hours late. As a side note, I've got to wonder what exactly was going on down there that made a tequila tasting overrun by that long. To be honest, I'm quite jealous but that's beside the point. We had a bit of a dilemma as we had to be downstairs to get the deal, but we weren't allowed downstairs. Our reasonable suggestion of providing the deal upstairs was met with a firm \"no\" and little explanation which didn't start us off well.However, as we were entrenched we switched tracks and ordered from the main menu. I selected a pork burrito (in my quest to best Eamon B for London burrito knowledge...however I'm still just a grasshopper compared to him) accompanied by a top shelf margarita. So let's see how they did...The burrito was good. Pork was tender with good flavour, the sour cream and salsa well layered, and the rice nicely done. Overall, it was perfectly fine to kill those hunger pangs in my belly. But not completely. Luckily, when dining with those of the fairer sex I find that there is always more food to be had if you are willing to scavenge. Even better, I have no shame when it comes to devouring leftovers so I promptly finished off the remaining third of a burrito left uneaten by Becky H and even polished off the veggies (it's not meat but it'll do in a pinch) from Claire F. What I really wanted was a plate of tacos for \u00a34 but c'est la vie. Sated, I moved on to my margarita that was left untouched in my food frenzy. Overall, I'll say that the margarita was well made (not as good as Max B's but then again few things are) with a \u00a0great balance of tart citrus flavours and mellow tequila. Minor problem. It was served in a tall glass. I'm old fashioned, I like my margaritas in a margarita glass rimmed with salt not looking like a cocktail with a straw!Overall, I think the good balanced out the bad. So I'll give it the average 3-star rating. Although I'm tempted to knock it down a peg as they charge you for chips and salsa and are stingy with portions. I mean seriously, a Mexican place that charges for chips? So wrong.",

    "text": "As someone originally from Texas, perhaps it's harder to find higher ratings in Mexican. The food is tasty, even if a bit a ways away from genuine Tex-Mex. We were there with a bit of a big group (8 people). The place was pretty busy so the waitresses had a bit of a handful. Even so, the waitresses didn't seem like they had a lot of experience. Lots of missed/mistaken orders. The chips and salsa aren't worth it. It's a tiny portion. Barely enough for one person to try. Prices are really reasonable. But there are some catches for that price.",

    "text": "Seriously, London?Once upon a time, a friend of mine told me a story about when he and his now wife were visiting her family in London. \u00a0Apparently she wanted Mexican, and he was dubious as London is not close to Mexico. \u00a0He also grew up in California, land of Mexican. \u00a0They had Mexican somewhere (I still don't know where), and apparently the food was appalling, which led him to warn me, \"There's no good Mexican in London.\" \u00a0Which to be fair, had seemed to be true for awhile.Last night, after drinking copious amounts of beer, a bunch of us were going to dinner, and of course many of them wanted a curry, as good British people do. \u00a0My partner and I are always down for going for Mexican instead. \u00a0Because hey, once I found a good Mexican, I want to return. \u00a0We managed to convince people, but instead of our usual Mexican hang out (because yes, we already found an amazing one), a friend recommend El Camion. \u00a0Well, except he couldn't remember the name, so I had to find it online. \u00a0I was a bit dubious about a new Mexican, due to the mantra my friend drilled into me before I moved. \u00a0Well, I think he just had something terrible, because El Camion turned out to be a flavorful Mexican wonderland! \u00a0It was definitely more like the Taqueria style Mexican of California than a more upscale, interesting Mexican fusion that I also enjoy. \u00a0The tacos were terrific. \u00a0The enchiladas looked great. \u00a0I had a bite of someone's burrito which was fantastic. \u00a0I ordered the side of spicy potatoes, and they were the perfect amount of spicy. \u00a0Their black beans are also fabulous.I'm definitely coming back here. \u00a0The only problems is that now I have to choose between two delicious Mexican restaurants. \u00a0And next time, I'm getting the flautas and the enchiladas!",

    "text": "El Camino is a great place to drink, and a pretty mediocre place to eat. Rob, Andrew - maybe you caught it on a good night, but I was taken aback by the miniscule size of the guacamole portion - susanacri; if you had half your portion, then a teaspoonful would be what you'd have eaten it with. In total, we waited an hour for food - half for the starters, half for the main. This was probably because the manager was entertaining his mates that night, and pitchers ('no, sorry, they're for the boss only') were being rushed to his table while customers waited to eat. And waited. In spite of this, we managed to wear the staff down so much with our nagging that we were given two free margaritas each - so our \u00a375 bill for poppers, chips, two enchilladas and four superb margaritas was, supplemented by four more of the same, not such bad value. However, if I'd have had to pay for them, I'd have been livid. The food, as pointed out on Urbanspoon, is d.o.d.g.y. I commented to the waiter that had it come in a box that said 'remove wrapping, pierce film and microwave for two minutes' I'd have been relieved that nobody had wasted ten minutes of their life wrapping it. Think LIDL. Have a margarita here, then head up to Benito's hat on Goodge Street for some great Mexican food.",

This is one of those places you have to know about to find as there doesn't seem to be any signage nor would the staff upstairs tell you there is a loungey DJ bar in the basement. The result was a decently crowded place in the heart of soho that still had a free booth or 2! It may or may not be one of those members only places, but just keep walking down the stairs like you belong and you should be grand:) The International crowd was definitely partying it up.Excellent excellent margaritas.

We got the large veggie platter with tostadas, tacos, quesadilllas and jaledas (stuffed jalapenos). Everything looked fresh and beautifully prepared. I loved the taste of the food but the chilli sauces on the table tasted flat to me. I would have loved the option of a fresh home-made sauce, which would have elevated this spot to a definite must-return for me.

Our server was nice and attentive. The guacamole was good and the tortillas were warm and crispy as you'd hope for in a Mexican restaurant. I found the chicken tinga quesadillas were yummy and after a comment from Alex S. I knew the cheese stuffed jalape\u00f1os were a must.

    "text": "I was so excited to go here for my friend's birthday (I love Mexican food, my family is Texan, and I've tried countless places, so I know a good Mexican when I have it!), but was extremely disappointed from the get go.My friend had booked a table for 16 way in advance, and the first thing the hostess said to her was \"do you want the tables pushed together?\" So the table wasn't ready. So we had to wait for that to be done, and then she was told by the waiter that our group of 16 only had an hour and a half because they had smaller groups coming in later.Throughout ordering (inevitably people were late, it's a large group and a half-decent restaurant should be prepared for that with a large group) we were constantly questioned with things like \"are there more people coming?\", and at one point the waitress sat next to my boyfriend annoyed because somebody took a little bit too long to order something. Also when she was asked about the tacos (which, notably, were only available in soft shell), was confused as to what we meant when we asked how big they were (\u00a325 for 12 tiny tacos is far overpriced).When our cocktails arrived they were all half-empty and slammed down, and our burritos arrived as dry wraps with rice on the side, which wouldn't be so much of an issue if there was enough rice to go with the wrap, and half of the sauces mentioned in the menu were actually detectable in the flavour. I can't speak for everybody's food, but I can say that of mine and my boyfriend's. But the tacos I saw looked tiny and not worth the money at all.At one point, the waiter (who was actually lovely), told my friend we had to hurry because they needed the table, but could go downstairs, and he agreed to wait until the one person left eating was finished. Less than 30 seconds later, the rude waitress returned and demanded we move in 3 minutes. When my friend said \"I can't just tell him to get up and move his food downstairs\" she huffed and puffed and made my friend feel uncomfortable.Given this was my friend's 21st birthday, most of us decided to just shift downstairs because she felt so uncomfortable and wanted to get to the next place. However once we got downstairs, after being ID'd and having to put our information in a book because of their \"licensing laws\", we waited about 10/15 minutes before having the bill slammed on the table by another waitress who rudely snapped \"make sure you pay that before you leave\".When I looked at the bill, I noted it had a 20% service charge on it!!!! This then upset my friend further, as everybody declared we would not be paying for such horrible service, and her friend went and dealt with the situation while she went and paid almost \u00a310 for a ridiculously small cocktail.From working in hospitality for a great deal of my life, I understand that larger groups bring more revenue, and as a well behaved group with a table of four behind us (they were there when we got there and hadn't moved when we were kicked off our table, for the record) bellowing for our entire meal, I feel extremely offended.All in all a horrible experience, with mediocre food, horrible service, and sub-par cocktails.",

The staff was super mega friendly and did go above and beyond to please us. The place has a huge decor of hot sauce, we were told these can be found in the USA, yet if someone is interested to try any, they should ask!",

    "text": "Finally found a Mexican joint in London that I was pleasantly surprised by! \u00a0And thus, El Camion will be my go-to whenever I have a craving.The nachos are out of this world delicious. \u00a0And the tortilla chips are much closer to what you get in Texas than what you would get at other places in London. \u00a0That being said, paying for chips and salsa? \u00a0Erg. \u00a0But I'll forgive you, El Camion, for being tasty in every other regard. \u00a0We had chicharones with guacamole for starters as well, and those little fried pig skins were perfect.I had the Yucatan Beef burrito as my main, \"wet\" (read: enchilada sauce), with rice and beans. \u00a0While the rice could have used a bit more time cooking, the flavor was good, and the black beans were really tasty. \u00a0I wouldn't get the enchilada sauce again as it bordered on sourish, but otherwise, the burrito was fab.But seriously... the nachos. \u00a0I'll be back to order a plate of those bad boys all to myself, thank you very much!",
