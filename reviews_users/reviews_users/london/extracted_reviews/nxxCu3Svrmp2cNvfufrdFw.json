    "text": "This place deserves it's Michelin star. Simple as that. It's a pub (kind of) that does fantastic food. I've actually been several times and dind at this place. One time it was particualarly disappointing (the service not the food) but I was assured that this was a one off. My resulting comlaint got us a tasting menu which did a lot to restore my faith in this place. The Harwood Arms does a variety of good English food and specialising in game. You are alost always guaranteed to see at least one of Pidgeon, Pheasant, Venison or Grouse on the menu, as well as traditional lamb and beef. You can also get proper English ales, in old schoo pint pots and the wine list is good too. If you get chance (i.e. if it's on the menu) then try the Scotch egg. The yoke is still runny inside! They boil the egg (for 5 mins) and then put it on ice. it is then wrapped in the prok meat and breadcrubed, before being put in the oven. hence when it is cooked it is still soft. Delicous!  I recommend this place. It is reasonably priced and the food is excellent. You might have to book well in advance, but it's woth it.",

We each tried the snails with osso buco marrow bone (an odd combo but it works), and the bread, both a plain (sourdough?) and a pumpernickel were fresh and quite tasty.For mains, the three of us ordered a different dish and shared: mutton, pheasant, and beef cheeks. Though they were all delish, the mutton was a standout. Crispy top almost made it taste like pork belly. In a word, \"yum.\"A rich meal, to be sure, so we all shared a portion of camp coffee ice cream. Unfussy and delicious.With wine for two of us, the total bill came to 97pounds. Not cheap, but certainly resoanable for the amount and quality of the food.",

The food is uniformly excellent and very reasonably priced--especially for west London.

    "text": "The Harwood Arms is much more than just another gastropub. Chef Stevie Williams cooked at two Michelin star The Square, so this is not the kind of pub food that involves heating things up in a microwave. A key reason why the food is so very good here is the produce, the game being supplied by sister restaurant The Pot Kiln in Berkshire, whose owner is a keen hunter. Consequently the venison, wild rabbit, pigeons etc that appear on the menu at the Harwood Arms are not from some mass-produced source, but from a real enthusiast who knows how to handle meat. Crayfish from the stream outside the Pot Kiln also regularly appear at the Harwood Arms. The kitchen also shows strong technical skills. Its regular dessert of delicious beignets show the skills that the chef picked up at The Square, while the Hardwood's Scotch egg is the stuff of legend in foodie circles. Made with venison rather than pork, each one made to order with a soft-cooked egg nestling inside the warm casing of meat and carefully seasoned batter, this is a great deal more than a bar snack. Several other serious places now offer a version, a sincere form of flattery and yet the Harwood Arms version is still the best I have eaten. The menu changes regularly but any game dish is a safe bet - there is even a complete vegetarian menu for those preferring their bunnies to be fluffy and cute rather than tasty. I have been extolling the delights of the Harwood Arms since it opened, and it now has a Michelin star as recognition of the skills on show here.

    "text": "Another leading light in London's burgeoning gastropub scene, The Harwood was never likely to live up to its hype. That it came damn close though speaks volumes. Shall we get the niggles out of the way? A side dish of kale never appeared. The much-touted venison scotch egg was a twist for the sake of a twist. When two vaguely professional foodies and the owner of a restaurant that celebrates British food wouldn't have known it was venison without reading the menu, it's probably time to go back to sausagemeat, chaps. A sea bream dish that was bright and light but came with pointless - and alarmingly bland - squid. A charming mini doughnut pudding that was disappointingly light on the jam. However, kipper croquettes were among the best bar snacks I've ever had. The snails were exemplary. The crispy brawn on the British meat platter deserved a starter of its own built around it. And the shoulder of roebuck, with celeriac mash, was probably the best piece of meat I've ever had in a pub. Topped with maple cured bacon and mustard, it was sweet, punchy, rich, tender It's a good job screens are wipe clean as I'm drooling just reminiscing. The celeriac and pickled mushroom salad that also came with it was also a perfect foil. Blooming good wine recommendation too - Rully, Meix Guillaume according to the notes, with deep blackcurranty notes to set the venison off. Smashing. When it's good, the Harwood Arms is spectacularly good. When it's bad well, it's probably still better than 90% of gastropubs in London.",

I think that the shoulder of venison - smokey, rich and creamy - slow cooked until it pulls apart like butter - is phenomenal... they say it's big enough for 4 (which is true) but I was so gobsmacked by it that I polished off half of it myself. Their menu is inventive and full of interesting combinations. This is also the place to get a gourmet Scotch Egg, which I thought was an oxymoron until I tried it. Parking is a bit prickly - with odd restrictions and the exodus from Chelsea stadium - so a taxi or tube might be best. Ambiance is okay but not fantastic. This is a 'working' pub alongside its gastro endeavours, so it feels a bit eclectic. I wish they did a bit more with the decor but otherwise it's a very nice surprise in an otherwise unremarkable location.",

    "text": "I must admit that I had my doubts. It was raining outside and I was about to embark upon a round trip of nearly 2 hours for Sunday lunch in a pub. It would seem a little crazy if the destination was not the Harwood Arms, famous for being the only 1 star pub in town and for its legendary scotch eggs. Despite my doubts, the rain was braved and some time later a slightly damp Duncan & Hannah W arrived at the pub. However, as I have already alluded, this is not a standard pub. Consequently, the bar doesn't really exist in a meaningful sense and if you arrived without a reservation you will be lucky to find a seat. The room however was delightful. Sunshine flowed in through large windows and a glass roof onto simple wooden tables dotted around the room. A happy hubbub of chatter filled the air. I had a pint of Otter to start (which was well kept and served in a mug) before moving onto the wine list. Aside from suggesting that diners should commit infanticide (and spending \u00a31200) by ordering a 2005 DRC, the list was well put together and reasonably priced. We opted for a 2009 Morgan which was delicious. After we were seated the first thing to arrive was the bread, served slightly warm and thickly sliced. Whether homemade or not, it was a success and disappeared within seconds to make way for our starters, a winter salad of turnip, beetroot and deep fried quail's egg and a vicar's game pie. Both were delightful, marrying the strong flavours of game/egg with acidity and bite in the accompaniments.For mains, we shared a roast rib of beef with all the trimmings. This was not your standard Sunday lunch. First, it was served on a giant wooden platter, like something from a medieval fairy tale. Second, it featured slight variations and improvements on the 'standard Sunday lunch'. The beef featured slivers of smoked bone marrow, the greens came with a mustardy dressing and the Yorkshire puddings were filled with a mushroom and onion mixture. This kind of frippery can go two ways but it was all delicious and we loved it.We hardly had room for desert. \u00a0However, we pressed on regardless. A Rhubarb Eton Mess was a lovely mix of cream, crunch and rhubarby goodness. \u00a0However, it was the other desert which was the true star - custard 3 ways - first a ginger custard creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, second honeycomb ice-cream, third a custard cream biscuit. \u00a0All of these were great but the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was simply stellar. \u00a0The custard was of a perfect consistency and the ginger provided welcome interest and texture.In short, this was a great meal. \u00a0I suspect that it might well be a better option for lunch rather than dinner. \u00a0However, I am sure that the food would be equally good whenever you visit.",

Main was a recommended pork chop which was a tad dry and wasn't epic. 4 out of 5. Two nice wines- a recommended white Rioja byRem\u00edrez de Ganuza Rioja Erre Punto Blanco (not sure which year) but it was very very good. The red was less thrilling; i tried 3 wines before finding a '10 Barbera d'Alba that I liked.

    "text": "Simply, this place is just disappointing. I visited London and decided to try some interesting restaurants during my trip. I am a fan of \"gastropub\" and using seasonal and fresh ingredients, so I was excited to try this pub after finding it online. I had very high expectations, especially after eating at numerous other sub-par London eateries. Unfortunately, the Harwood Arms was a complete let down. The d\u00e9cor is nice, and the ambiance is great, but the food doesn't live up to the hype. I had these cauliflower and cheese croquettes, which weren't actually anything more than fried cheese, and the scotch venison egg was heavily over salted. In fact, these two attributes turned out to be the themes for the night: fried and incompetently salted. The mains, a cod dish and a lamb dish continued this trend. The cod was so over salted that we had to peel off the top section for it to be edible, while the lamb tasted as if there was no salt at all. And the accompaniments to these mains were more fried items. It's a bit sad when the most enjoyable food on the table is the pickled cabbage.I understand that fried food is a big part of pub cuisine, but for a place calling itself a \"gastropub\" and having a Michelin star, I expected a little more finesse that just frying and salting things until I couldn't taste the ingredients anymore. What's the point of using great ingredients if they aren't cooked in a way to highlight their flavor?If you live in London, maybe this would be an interesting place to go to: it at least seems better than the other pubs I ate at. However, if you are from anywhere else, I would say skip it. You will just be disappointed. Maybe I am spoiled since I am from California and used to great ingredients at most restaurants, but I did not think that the Harwood Arms was anything very special, let alone worthy of a Michelin star or such hype.",

    "text": "A michelin starred gastro-pub in Fulham...sign me up! This quaint, bright and airy pub is located in the heart of a rather random residential area about a 10 minute walk from the Fulham-Broadway underground station. We stumbled upon it late on a Sunday afternoon (thanks Yelp!), and luckily they had a few cancellations and were able to accommodate us. Normally you have to book a few weeks in advance for Sunday roast.For starters, we shared the wild game platter. Instead of cured meats, the Harwood Arms offers spruced up versions of such British favourites as sausage rolls, venison scotch egg, grilled boar sausage, and liver parfait. It was perhaps the finest sausage roll I've ever had and the first time I've had one paired with a glass of Pol Roger. To finish the starter consisted of a wild game consomm\u00e9.For the main, we shared the roast pork for 2. This large platter came with pork 3 ways---roast, pulled, and pork belly. The pork belly in particular was a standout and the most tender fall apart piece of pig I've had in some time. Definitely worth getting if on the menu. The portion for 2 was large and also came with some \u00a0charcoaled butter greens, roast potatoes, and chutney.The Harwood Arms is arguably one of the best pubs for food in all of London, and if you are a fan of wild game and who isn't these days, it's definitely worth making a booking!",

    "text": "Simply Awesome! Go here and feast!Located in the Fulham residental area, this unassuming pub can easily fool the eye. Looking like many of the pubs around, this is one of the few pubs to hold a Michelin Star. Came here on a Sunday, so appropriately so, a Sunday roast is required. They had 2 on the menu, one as part of the specials (Venison) and the standard one (Beef). Each of the roast are recommended for 2 people and with 4 in our group, we had to get both. Here's the rundown:Starters:BreadEat the Soda Bread. It's that damn good.Butternut squash soup with squid and garlicThis was amazing. It came in a small shot glass-like cups and was savory and succulent. Only wished there was more as it was a great instrument to cut through all the meats.Harwood Arms Scotch EggsNot on the menu during our visit, but we ordered it and you should too. I haven't had scotch eggs before so I couldn't compare against anything, but this was also quite good. Slicing through the egg allowed for the gooey beautiful yolk to ooze onto the outer meat layer. Roasts:BeefBeautiful pink center with an outer ring. Along with the beef's own jus, it was melt in your mouth goodness. VenisonThis was wrapped in bacon to keep the venison nice and moist. It also added a salty-sweetness to the game meat. Having the soup along with the venison was a great interplay to cut through the meat.Along with the huge pieces of meat come several accompaniments. All very good in their own as well.Accompaniments: Crispy Garlic PotatoesNice potatoes that served a nice textural difference. Not only that, they were darn good with the garlic essence and spices.Cheese CauliflowerA very flavorful and another addition to the cutting through the richness of the meat.Mushrooms & BeetsTwo separate sides, but both roasted and just simply good.This was a lot of food and I'm still missing several sides. You'll need to come extra hungry in order to be even close to finishing this behemoth of a meal. With that said, all the food was excellent and I would recommend everything above and anything else you can fit in your stomach. Absolutely amazing.",

    "text": "The traditional London pub with some nice ales on cask, a good bar, a fireplace and a great kitchen seems to be becoming a rare elusive beast not easily spotted within the city. The problem seems to be that a lot of them have been bought up by the same 2-3 major corporations who use the same shit frozen pies and pre-packaged food. That is anything but the case here though, This has to be my favorite pub in all of London, and the Sunday roast is absolutely divine: Aged Rib Eye, perfectly medium rare, Bone marrow gravy, and the most perfect Yorkshire pudding. This was my 4th trip here and I have had the specials, and other mains as well all of which were just spectacular. they have never missed a step with impeccable service and divine food. Couple of tips, Make a reservation or get there early before food service and have a few drinks at the bar expecting to eat at the bar if you do not have a reservation. Also order the Scotch Egg (it is only on the bar menu but they serve it in the dining room too).",

    "text": "I came with two friends to this Michelin star neighbourhood gem tucked amongst the residential houses near Earl's Court after one of them (from America) had heard about it back in the States. I've also seen on a list of top gastropubs in London, because if memory serves, it is the only one with a Michelin star. The restaurant was quite relaxed on a weekday evening, but even then nearly every table was full. They have a rotating seasonal menu with the option to order 2 courses for \u00a333.50 or 3 courses for \u00a339.50. And the night started off on a good note because before the meal, we got wonderfully soft fresh bread served with soft butter at room temperature (so many restaurants don't get this right!), sea salt, and a few slices of salami. I've never gotten complimentary cured meat before - so impressed! We also ordered a bottle of sauvignon blanc, which was quite reasonably priced at \u00a326 (there are also a number of other sub-\u00a330 options on the list).For starters, we ordered the pigeon faggots, the pressed pig's head, and the Cornish squid, and I got to try some of each. My choice was the squid, which came with a good 5-6 bite sized pieces, but the faggots were more like 3 small meatballs and the pig's head was actually a small fried chunk of meat that tasted a lot like a ham croquette. I thought the squid was well executed, but if you are going to be adventurous, the faggots were delicious and exceeded my expectations. By contrast, the pig's head was interesting but rather underwhelming when you expect something striking (the name sounds cool, right?) and you get something smaller than a hash brown. For mains we got wild mallard, pheasant, and beef cheek. My selection was the pheasant, which came recommended by our server when I was deciding between the mallard and the pheasant, and it was very tender and definitely a crowd pleaser (my two friends thought it was their favourite too). The mallard was a little overwhelmed by the beets it was served with, which dyed the whole dish purple, and the beef cheek was nice but tasted much like your typical beef.For dessert they had beer ice cream served with some sort of buttermilk cream. We were sufficiently intrigued to order it, but didn't come away all that impressed. I'd say that was my general takeaway from the restaurant as well... the menu had some interesting items on it and it's hit or miss with those, but if you come expecting a Michelin star establishment to sweep you off your feet, Harwood Arms falls a little bit short.",

Never mind: everything else was expertly prepared. From a perfectly chunky pig's head to a really nice pork tenderloin roast (actually the tenderloin, while very good, was the least interesting thing on the plate: the pork belly and cracklings were much better.) The truffle mash fell short only because it did not taste of truffle (this happens so often, why bother?) But a small criticism. The bread here is also some of the best I've ever tasted (which I think it really saying something coming from someone who's lived a lot of his life in San Francisco.)",

We finished with a guinness ice cream with buttermilk malt and the doughnuts. The ice cream was nothing to write home about, yet the doughnuts were warm and scrumptious. Harwood Arms is a MUST!",

The menu is great. \u00a0You could go for the \u00a325 set menu which sounded delicious, but we were tempted by sharing a few a la carte options. The duck terrine was a bit on the smallish sides but as they say it's not quantity but quality and this was a bit special. \u00a0Pheasant main course with buttered greens and potatoes was an outstanding use of seasonal produce cooked pretty perfectly. If you haven't tried pheasant before this is the place to do it. \u00a0And without sounding trite it does kinda taste like chicken... The staff were efficient if a little standoffish \u00a0but by the end of the lunch we had managed a smile from the typically stiff upper lipped British staff. This place is so quintessentially British that it would be somewhat rude to visit London and not check it out.",

I get out my Yelpy app and discovered the 'best Scotch egg' in London is right in his neighbourhood. Gotta get me some of that. We trekked up a very residential back street to find the lovely and very hip Harwood Arms. I remarked that it had a very 'east London vibe', this was met with a scowl. But it totally does. Great hardwood floors and design, cool tattooed bar staff* playing 'The Tallest Man on Earth' album. This is not your grandfather's local! We ordered a couple of beers and THE VENISON SCOTCH EGG and they were totally indulgent. It was warm and decadent - you cut through it and a perfectly cooked egg yolk runs out. The venison is rich and the sea salt on top is a great touch.

I don't know what they normally serve for lunch, but the bar menu items are excellent and we'll worth the money and trip out to Fulham from central London.Harwood scotch egg- I essentially came here for this and it didn't disappoint. Crunchy on the outside, flavorful with a perfectly soft boiled egg.Venison rilletes- my favorite of the three items I ordered. Venison cooked on a stick of some sort (maybe fruit wood?), caramelized, and served with a delicious honey mustard sauce, and mustard-enhanced pickles. Cauliflower cheese croquettes. Very well done. Not as interesting as the first two (but difficult to be surprising as a croquette) but I enjoyed them, have no complaints, and would still recommend them if you're in the mood for it.",

The food was DELICIOUS. The wine was really good, and the server was super fun and help. His scottishness fit right into the restaurant ambiance. Definitely go for anything here that they describe as \"the roast\", though probably stay clear of the fish. The fish was good, but looked horribly disappointing next to the giant meat and potatoes plate that we ordered. Enjoy!",

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, and if you need any advice on what to drink with \u00a0your meal they are more than happy to help! I had the most delicious warm smoked salmon I have had in my life, which hoenstly melted lke butter in my mouth. The fact that I am not a huge fan of mashed potatoes completely changed as I also had the best mashed potatoes that I have ever had, it was truely life changing!! Creamy and buttery, I had to steal from the rest of my family members as I had finished mine! The dessert was the only point that dissapointed, as we had fried doughnut holes with some sort of cream, but they were extremely dry and tasteless, but we did not let that even influence our experience there!",

The venison wasn't gamey at all.- Bread: dense inside, crusty outside, served warm. The butter and flaked salt are really good with it.They did a 2 course for \u00a0\u00a335.50, and there was a special one for around \u00a322. \u00a0We ended up sharing everything - Oxtail broth with suet pudding and pearl barley. The broth was light, and the dumpling was beefy. The texture on the dough was really good. - Charred Cornish mackerel: good char flavor. The grapefruit and fennel slaw underneath was light and a gold complement - Salt cod: I liked the seaweed type lettuce and sea beans. The cod was tender, and there were potato dumplings (like gnocchi)- Cornish sea bream: bacony creamy potatoes underneath were the highlight for me - Duck: perfectly pink duck breast with violet artichokes, kale (black cabbage), and chanterelles - Crispy layered potatoes: these came complimentary and were really good eaten warm with some extra saltSparkling and still water are complimentary.It was a bit of a slower lunch, but it was very leisurely, and food was solid. \u00a0I thought the croquettes and the scotch egg were the highlights. Service is very friendly, and it's a low key, brightly lit place with some touches of a British pub (the stuffed animals on the all, etc). It's very refined British food ,and it's worth checking out.",

The bar itself is stocked with all my favorite gins and doesn't serve the horrible tonic, fever tree or nothing. Also the bread is incredible! To the food: it should be noted that we waited for almost an hour to be served and when it finally did arrive it was a bit cold. We ordered the Sunday roast beef ribeye, with all the trimmings. The meat was delicious, perfectly cooked and needed no gravy or additions. The cauliflower cheese was undercooked but tastey. The greens were over salted but cooked well and not soggy. The potatoes should have been roasted but were simply deep fried, which isn't the proper way. The Yorkshire pudding was perfect, and stuffed with beef and onions- a real treat. The dessert! Oh the dessert! Lovely!! Treacle ice cream with chocolate and stout, and buttermilk pudding with strawberries and amazing sorbet. To die for.The service staff were attentive and pleasant, although no apologies for the cold or long wait for food.Overall, I'm not sure if this place deserves a Michelin star... But I did enjoy it and the price was very reasonable without wine.",

Greg discovered The Harwood Arms after doing research on best interpretation of gastro-pub food. \u00a0Is it no surprise that we found this place? Yeah, I didn't think so either. \u00a0I really enjoyed the neighborhood walk from the Fulham tube stop, and especially enjoyed the comforting, feels-like-home environment once you walked in. \u00a0For a Monday evening, there was certainly a lot of people that in for dinner, so we knew we were in the right place.We perused the menu, but let's be honest, the first thing we were going to order was the Venison Scotch Egg. \u00a0It came whole, which is a huge change from how I've typically had it where they cut it in half for you. \u00a0The awesome effect of cutting into this and seeing the beautiful inside is definitely a huge treat. \u00a0Not to mention, it was delicious, especially with that small add of salt on top!We were served two types of bread, one that was made of potato and the other made out of soda. \u00a0And in a typical overexcitement, we overindulged by eating too much of it early on. \u00a0But it was so delicious! Props to Harwood Arms for crafting their own bread too.We passed on appetizers, mostly because we wanted the mushroom tart but was informed it had sold out for the evening. \u00a0We did, however, add on a side of crispy garlic potatoes, which later on turned out to be a big mistake since we had overeaten on the bread.For our mains, I selected the leg and belly of Middlewhite pork with onions in ale and young carrots. \u00a0Greg had the roast Berkshire pheasant breast with buttered greens and a pressed potato side. \u00a0My pork was absolutely delicious, especially the pork belly. \u00a0The piece was portioned perfectly, and was just slightly crispy! \u00a0It might be some of the best pork belly I've ever had. \u00a0I struggled to finish my dish because I was trying to fend off the full feeling from the bread and the potatoes, but it was absolutely delicious. \u00a0Greg really enjoyed his pheasant but was also struggling to finish as a result of overindulgence in the starters. \u00a0We were both so full from dinner, but seeing how The Harwood Arms is known for their desserts, we really couldn't pass it up.Finally, dessert. \u00a0Yum! \u00a0We went with the special of the day, which was spiced cinnamon and apple ice cream with a caramel sauce and apple bits in addition to frozen goats' curd with vanilla, walnuts & figs based on a recommendation from the server. \u00a0My favorite? \u00a0The frozen goats' curd hands down. \u00a0This was creamy and light, and went well with my cappuccino!Overall, definitely a 5 out of 5 for The Harwood Arms. \u00a0Not only do they locally source their meats and veg, but they care so much about each of their dishes. Absolutely stunning meal in Fulham!",

The servers were very forgiving that we were late and lost. (Life without Internet is so hard). We sat down and decided on a bottle of prosecco to share, and it was so crisp with a light peach flavor.I appreciated the specials they had on the board, but the daily menu also had so many enticing rustic dishes. We forewent appetizers because we weren't that hungry and chose entrees and dessert instead. I got the roast rump of veal with garlic mashed potato, mushrooms and artichokes. The veal was cooked a perfect medium and the potatoes were soooooooo creamy and dreamy. My friend got the breaded lemon sole with broccoli, fennel and brown shrimp, which she loved as well. It's amazing how they've taken simple ingredients and elevated them. We were excited to try the desserts after our fantastic main courses. We split the English cheese plate and the tarragon sugar donuts with blood orange filling. The cheeses were fairly mild. We'd never had oatcakes and it wasn't as good as the bread we're used to eating cheese with. The donuts were kind of a let down; the flavors didn't work well for me. A bite of them with the tartness of the blood orange, the herbal flavor of the sugar, and the rich cream didn't quite come together.We were amazed by how affordable our delicious (Michelin) meal was. It was such a pleasant low-key fine dining experience, which is ideal. I wish there were more restaurants like this!",

My wife had the rabbit followed by the osso buco. The quail was fine but the pairings on the plate brought nothing to the dish. The lamb was tough and totally devoid of any lamb flavor. The rabbit was serviceable but plating was a bit sloppy. The osso buco was forgettable. The best part of the meal was the dessert. It was some sort of berry souffl\u00e9. For a 100 pound dinner (without wine or drinks), I expect a lot more. Not really sure how this place received a Michelin star. Wouldn't recommend.",

After looking through Yelp findings and reviews we decided to give this restaurant a try. A good 10 minutes walk from busy street into to the residential area was well worth it.Now to the restaurant itself. It is fairly small, probably a little less than 20 tables with pretty minimalistic ambience, but good attention to details that make the visit very comfortable. The whole dining area is operated by two very friendly people who share the waiter/bartender responsibilities. \u00a0But don't let that discourage you!The menu was really short, but there were very few items that I wouldn't be interested in. And the specials sounded exceptionally, but unfortunately I couldn't try those. \u00a0We have shared the chicken livers appetizer, my wife had the veal and I decided to go with lamb. \u00a0All food looked and tasted simply phenomenal.

I won't be back.Many reviewers have commented on how few servers seem to be working the restaurant. Many have commented that they had to flag down their server. Yet those reviewers have rated this place 4 and 5 stars. Given the price I'm paying, especially with a \"service charge\" added to the bill for our table of 4, I'm not at all satisfied with the experience. We were sat for 45 minutes before we got our first drink. Anything else we needed required getting up to go find the waitress because she wasn't going to find us. There are plenty of pubs where this is the norm. But they don't charge \u00a3180 for a dinner for four (we didn't have wine). The meal lasted 2 hours, but most of that time was delay waiting on the service.I shudder to think how much more money the restaurant owner would make if they hired enough staff to be attentive to their patrons. They could actually turn tables over quicker and sell more food and drink by checking in more often. When she asked us whether we wanted dessert, my thought genuinely was about how long it would take to get it. I didn't fancy another 45 minutes to do coffee and dessert--Michelin star or no. I told her no, thank you, and we would like the bill. She still didn't hear that and I had to flag her down and ask for the bill a second time. The food is outstanding but the experience is not worth it.",

Surprisingly, there were plenty of empty tables and it seemed like they only have one seating in the evenings. Did that reflect in the availability and attention of the service staff? Not really. We still had to make faces and wave our hands to get the attention of the two staff running around.The menu is quite interesting and has a varied selection in each of the appetizer, mains and dessert sections. Excellent wine list, plenty of new world and local wines, and the staff know what they are talking about in their recommendations.Two course menu \u00a333.50, Three course menu \u00a339.50Hereford snails with oxtail, stout and parsley - 6 giant snails stuffed to the top of the shell with juicy snail, diced oxtail meat, parsley and toasted breadcrumbs which added a nice thin crusty layer. The side toast with creamy baked cheese was a nice addition but a bit strong to complement the snails.Braised Longhorn beef with black cabbage, white beetroot and smoked bone marrow - good god this was deliciously tender beef that fell apart on my fork. The sweet white beetroot was perfectly matched. I didn't see much of the bone marrow and instead it seemed to have been replaced with a spinach or kale.Buttermilk pudding with English berries and toasted almonds - essentially a softer vanilla panna cotta topped with large fresh blackberries and raspberries, a homemade raspberry sorbet which was as good as it gets, and two almond friands on the side which were quite moist and dense.A great experience worth trying once but very rich flavours and meaty, not something I would go back for regularly.",

It is pricey and the portions aren't exactly gigantic, but I do think the price reflects the quality of the food and the appealing setting. I would recommend the lemon curd donuts with earl grey cream. Would I go again: Yes",

But, disclaimer: I don't think you can truly classify it as a \"pub\"- it has a way more upscale feel to it than normal English pubs, and a way more elaborate menu than you'd find at normal ones. Nevertheless, it was amazing. We started off with the crab tarts and the partridge with salad. Both were soooo good. The crab tarts had a small hint of lemon and it was the perfect flavor combination. The partridge was perfectly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside, and the dressing of the salad was delicious. We then opted for the special of the day which was a braised deer shoulder with cabbage, parsnips, smoked bone marrow tart, and crispy potatoes. It was incredible!!!! The deer shoulder was wrapped in bacon and was soooo tender and delicious. Everything was cooked to perfection.Finally, we had the lemon donuts with an earl grey cream- also incredible. I highly recommend making a stop here, you won't regret it!!",

It looks very casual more of a pub than a dining room and although the food was delicious and creative it's definitely more traditional than most other Michelin starred restaurants I've been to.Great wine list, divided by country which I like. Got a Spanish crianza 2012 called manium I think, which was nice.I tried a bit of everything, from the beetroot starter which was great to the special crispy rabbit which had a lovely sauce. We also got the special main which was deer for 2 with a 3 pound supplement each. I really enjoyed it. Just gamey enough, very tender and with some lovely vegetables, bone marrow tarts and gravy. Their chips are a highlight.To finish we shared the donuts because I can never say no to donuts. They were freshly made and not sweet at all which was very welcome after the feast.We definitely should only have ordered 1 starter as I was uncomfortably full for about and hour after we left - but that's just my friends and I being greedy piglets. My only complaint is that it's sooooooo far. I never come to Fulham Broadway and made the journey especially for the restaurant but being used to going to Clerkenwell, shoreditch or Islington or dinner.. it's unlikely I'll return soon.Total bill for 3 came to 185 with service so not too bad at all for the quality of the food!",

I guess you can say they've got their game on. \u00a0;)With reservations made a month in advance, two weeks out being sufficient, we headed to Fulham on a lazy afternoon for a late lunch.Our plan: Eat, drink and be merry!The location was hidden down the neighborhood's back streets, a charming walk leading to the pub/restaurant. It was easy to get to using public transportation.Once arrived, we were greeted by Assistant Manager, Sarah Marouane and seated quickly. The rustic vibe was certainly there and the fine details and linens elevated it to something more.We opted to order one set meal from the lunch menu and the blackboard special. Lucky me! There was only one order of the special left.The food was prepared with much detail and care. Every bite balanced in taste and texture. You can visually tell Chef Alex Sergeant and team treated every ingredient with care.Despite being over overzealous about trying the blackboard specials, I was disappointed in the aged meat. It was slightly underwhelming in taste. Perhaps the top players were every dish, I had to pick a least favorite.The service was thoughtful and besides the delay in our appetizers, they have their \"game\" together 100%. More on my website.What You Need To Know:-- Reservations can be made via Opentable-- Book at least two weeks in advance-- Public Transport: The pub is a 5 minute walk from all bus stops and tube station at Fulham Broadway.-- Travelcard Zone 2.-- Walking down a neighborhood street-- Dessert is also a winner!",

    "text": "The Harwood Arms concept was quite fun. \u00a0I love a good neighborhood pub, but they turned it up a notch into more modern and upscale food offerings while leaving the relaxed pub atmosphere. \u00a0For a started I had the venison scotch egg which was cooked to perfection. \u00a0I also had bone marrow with escargot. \u00a0For my main course I also ordered \u00a0venison. \u00a0 I've never had venison other than some type of cured or jerky style. \u00a0This was cooked, I believe, medium rare and very flavorful. \u00a0Although I normally don't visit upscale restaurants Harwood Arms was a great experience.",

    "text": "This was listed as one of the 50 best restaurants of London by Time Out and they're not wrong.Located in Fulham, this gastro pub has a very nice cosy feeling to it, perfect for dinner with friends, date or even a business dinner. It's a pretty calm/quiet place with tons of space between the tables. They do a set dinner (2 courses for \u00a333, 3 for \u00a339) which includes the best meat I've eaten in a long time (and I don't really like meat). The special of the day comes with mashed potatoes with fried shallots that are almost as good as the one from L'atelier de Joel Robuchon. They have a very long list of wines (although we sticked to beer and cider).Perfect quantities, small enough so you're still hungry for dessert.",

    "text": "My partner in Michelins and I paid The Harwood Arms a visit for dinner. We lucked out and had no issues snagging a reservation a day or two in advance at London's only pub with a Michelin star. Having survived some Tube problems, it was quite nice to stroll around a pretty residential neighborhood as we tried to find this pub.We were cheerfully welcomed and seated in the bright dining area (lots of windows). Some complimentary wheat bread started off the meal on a positive note. I think we had to pay for the bottle of water though, if I recall correctly. We decided to get the \u00a342.50 three course dinner since that way, we could get dessert, naturally! If you lack a sweet tooth, the two course dinner is \u00a335.50. We made sure to get different dishes so we could sample more things, an excellent strategy.1. Berkshire wood pigeon faggots with celeriac, prune and crispy shallotsI didn't know what to expect, but what I got was meatballs. Very satisfactory. The crispy shallots were my favorite part. Not super prune-y.2. Braised jowl of Tamworth pork with bacon marmalade, cider pickled cabbage and appleMy friend got the lamb and I must've been eyeing it during the whole course. It truly looked splendid, and I relished the morsel I got to sample. But to my relief, there was nothing shameful about ordering the pork. The meat was soft and everything was just darn delicious. The marmalade verged on being too salty but was kept in check. The side of the potatoes was incredibly creamy and smooth. Mmm.3. Warm malted chocolate cake with pearl barley and lovage ice creamAs much as it pains me to say it, the dessert was the weakest pillar of the meal, and I love dessert. The chocolate cake wasn't too sweet but I thought it could be a touch sweeter. The barley added an intriguing squishy bead texture. The lovage ice cream tasted like a blend of celery and licorice, and I'm not the biggest fan of either so it was a miss for me. The ice cream was a stunning mint hue, I'll say.The service was good; both a woman and a man served us. It got maybe a little less attentive towards the end of the meal, but it was fine overall. Lovely bathrooms with pleasant-smelling soap. The Harwood Arms: definitely one of my top meals in London. [Yelp review #400!]",

    "text": "Buried in the west side of London, we tried to find a good place to eat near Hammersmith that wouldn't kill our business budget but still give us a fantastic meal. \u00a0Thanks to Michelin and the many positive yelp reviews, we decided to come here. \u00a0This was possibly one of the best meals we had but also the quirkiest. \u00a0The food was truly enjoyable and we wished we ordered the venison roast for two as we saw table after table getting fed this magnificent feast. \u00a0Next time I say!So Harwood Arms is tucked aside from the busy streets and I love how it's so quaint and secluded... you're away from the crazy traffic (and it truly was crazy) and you get to enjoy this great gastropub. \u00a0The place is quite wonderful with it's many wood finishes, heads of animals decorating the walls, and open windows. \u00a0I love how they spaced the tables far from each other so you can still hear your own conversation without yelling.The service is a bit quirky... and slow. \u00a0We had a very happy but unusual server and though she clearly tried, it almost felt like she was too strained for a full restaurant and she was a bit dictative on how things should be enjoyed. \u00a0Her answers to our menu questions were comically unhelpful but that's because we had the most wonderful server from Angelsea Arms the day before to compare. \u00a0Our plates did sit for quite some time between entree and dessert. \u00a0Perhaps a full restaurant on a Wednesday was not forecasted and they were short staff?As for the food... oh dear lord. \u00a0This is the best meal of the entire trip... lovely plating but the taste matters more and they did bring the flavour out of wonderful ingredients! \u00a0We started with the mackeral which was the special of the day. \u00a0Normally other restaurants dont handle this well and it can be strong.. in the hands of the Harwood, the skin was crispy like a perfect kettle cooked crisp, the meat was moist still and was complimented wonderfully with the sides and citrus based sauce that cut the fatty meat nicely. \u00a0I had the salmon which was perfectly cooked again... they really know how to handle seafood and fish impeccably. \u00a0My colleague had the duck and he thought it was the best duck he's had in a long time and possibly all of London. We had a scotch egg to try and wow... best rendition in a long time. \u00a0They added venison to the pork encasing a great egg with molten yolk. \u00a0Fantastic. \u00a0We decided to eat the dessert though we were quite full and I dont regret it. I had the strawberry tart which was like a hit of summer in sugary bite. \u00a0My friend wanted lighter and he enjoyed the honey mousse.Aside from the slow and quicky service, this was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. \u00a0I'll definitely try coming back as it's only 10 minutes from our office. \u00a0Love this place",

The service is perfect, they will be there to answer to any of your request but won't be too present. The place feels cosy, like a good old familial pub should be but with a hint of \"poshness\". Quiet and with plenty of space. The food was also amazing (Time out Top 50) and I loved almost everything that I tried there.I had the 2 courses set for dinner (\u00a333) with a starter: cornish crab on muffins, as main: a perfectly cooked pheasant with greens and potato and as dessert: donuts with rasberry jam and vanilla cream that was a bit NON sugary for me (booouuuh).It was an overall perfect experience and would gladly go back there to try something else.",

Regrettably for most mortals, the locals are primarily of the hooray henry horsey variety, but not needlessly uncivil or boorish. Being a gastropub (an unfortunate, but admittedly convenient expression), the Harwood Arms is informal and slightly chaotic, but there is no doubting the brilliance of the food and the sheer audacious inspiration of its menu. In autumn, for example, there is a dominance of game - pheasant, hare, wood pigeon, rabbit, grouse, venison - and year-round you can eat huge Herefordshire snails or delicious Dorset crab or smoked eels. The wine list is refreshingly broad and balanced, and very reasonably priced - such a relief from the constantly abusive mark-ups you get in most other restaurants in Central or West London. This is a damn fine place to eat, no question.",
