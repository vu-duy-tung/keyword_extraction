We were a group of four and ordered a selection of starter dishes, the prawn crackers, spring rolls and edemames in spicy chilli oil were full of an authentic approach. The mains again a selection of really aromatic dishes, including the Chicken Firecracker which they kindly arranged with halal chicken and the cod and steamed rice which was cooked with richness. I should also mention the range of exotic lemonade options and fine served deserts. Above all was the truly friendly and exceptional service, which they managed and maintained even though the restaurant was busy with queues forming to the door. I would strongly recommend this place for a satisfying meal with brilliant service, which can be very difficult to reach in central London",

    "text": "It's a shame that this review isn't going to be great for Dim T as I REALLY like it here and wish so much for it sort out the negatives so I wasn't left feeling disappointed each time and like I should have known better. How many chances to you give somewhere that you want to enjoy but who can't just quite pull it together? I've been here three times now and there are several things you really can't fault: 1. The view (especially from upstairs). It's surely got to be the best, unobscured view of Tower Bridge you can get. Simply stunning at night. 2. The layout and decor. So warming and cosy, with a quirky layout including a mixture of cushioned booths, circular & square tables and a waiting area. The dark wood looks very luxurious and the whole scheme is very well put together. Now on to the hit & miss parts.... The service really isn't the best and unfortunately it tends to sit somewhere between medicore, rude and lazy. Sometimes you are left waiting for things you've requested. Other times you get obnoxious comments when you ask questions about the menu (we ordered a bottle of the Shiraz and when it arrived it was a Merlot, only when we questioned this were we were told \"we were out of Shiraz\"). The prices are quite good and there are often offers available if you check online in advance. The food is tasty but I've found that the portion sizes aren't consistent. My udon noodle dish was half the size of the person on the table next to me. The food-intolerance menu is very frustrating, I noticed several errors and it was annoyingly laid out by what's not suitable rather than giving a list in the positive. I wouldn't say \"don't go\", but I'll keep my fingers crossed it's a night they're on good form and really urge Dim T @ More London to up their game as you've got the potential to be great!",

The pad thai is unlike any I have tasted before (a bit tomatoey), and although it's great that the main dishes come with rice included in the price unlike some restaurants, the quality is not that great. I found the Hong Kong sweet and sour chicken sauce slightly gloopy and the firecracker prawns special was hardly anything special at all. Service was incredibly slow and you felt forgotton about particularly if you were a small group in the corner. The only redeeming parts of the meal was the duck spring rolls (starter), white chocolate cheesecake dessert, and the various teas on offer which were also good (particularly as they offered free refills of hot water). Would't go there again to be honest, unless I had relatives from overseas who were more concerned about the atmosphere and scenery rather than the food.",

We ordered dim sum for starters, and then were told a fire in the kitchens meant either a 30 minute wait for dim sum or we could eat some warm bits from a trolley, but they didn't have vegetable ones there, just meat. Not great for a group with a vegetarian. OK, a one off perhaps. Then our main courses came and the waiter realised we didn't have chopsticks. He said he'd get us some, and then went to take another table's drinks order leaving us with our food getting cold until I went up to the counter to ask for chopsticks. The food, when we did get to eat it, was a very mixed temperature throughout the dish, cold bits of chicken thrown in with warm Japanese rice. Not good. On to dessert, then. The orders were taken before they came back to tell us one of the dishes was now off the menu, and again the food was disappointing. I paid nearly \u00a35 for a pile of frozen berries with a tablespoon of melted white chocolate - nothing like the Ivy dessert it's stolen from. To sum up, next time I'll go to Ping Pong.",

The main was not like the kind of thing I normally order - I usually stick with safe options or something recommended to me - but it was absolutely delicious and a new favourite. I really enjoyed the dim sum too. My friend had the clay pot chicken and said it was very good. The service was really good and I was full after the meal so decided not to have dessert.

Make sure to make reservations if you're going during the week, and if it's during the day, dress nicely. Any time there is a dress-down day at work and people go there, the already-slow service takes 3 times as long.

The miso soup was nice as well. I intended to write more, but at the the end of the day it's pretty solid, pretty well priced dim sum that won't blow your socks off. I'd imagine you could get better/cheaper stuff in China town, but this place wins on simplicity and convenience",

It's more like \"yeah, we serve some dim sum dishes as apps, but other than that we're a regular asian influenced restaurant\". It was a lackluster experience. I ordered a fish dish that was bland in taste. I had to layer on the hot sauce to get some time of heat or flavor into the dish. Either way, I wouldn't come back unless it was the only place open late in the evening... There's so many other options out there. Pass on this.",

I recommend asking for a seat upstairs by the window for the best view, its worth waiting for. It's particularly lovely in summer as The Scoop have free shows on in the evenings.

I was part of a large group for a surprise birthday. Naturally when it's a surprise, \u00a0the birthday boy/girl arrive AFTER everyone else. You would expect to be at least offered drinks while you wait, \u00a0yet we were ignored for 20 mins before we managed to flag a waitress down to order a drink. The would-be manager kept threatening to split our table because the birthday girl was running late yet our drinks didn't arrive until half an hour after the birthday girl herself, \u00a0despite polite reminders to the apparent manager! You definitely don't feel like a valued customer! Heat! It is like a sauna upstairs! I see on previous reviews years ago that this has not changed! It needs to! Not the most comfortable way to enjoy a meal! Menu - in short, \u00a0this is really a general Asian food restaurant masquerading as a dim sum place. The dim sum is a little limited if that's what you're looking for. It's a shame really because the view alone makes for a great atmosphere. It's a good job I was with great company!",

Just a few minutes walk from the Tower Bridge station, this restaurant sits on the edge of the river and has a marvelous view of the City Hall and the Tower Bridge. The scenery from inside the restaurant next to the window or outdoor on the patio is one of the best in London. ATMOSPHEREDo not be fooled. Dim T isn't what you would expect if you're looking for the traditional dim sum experience where they push around carts of small plates that you point at and tally up on your card. Instead, Dim T is primarily a thai restaurant that also serves some dim sum dumplings that you can order off the menu. Once you get over that little nuance, the d\u00e9cor is really clean and modern for a Thai restaurant. FOODWhenever I go to a Thai restaurant, I like to order green curry, so I that's what I got! Unfortunately, their curry doesn't come with rice (boo), so I ordered a side bowl of brown rice. The texture was a bit grainier and thicker than I what I'm used to, but the flavor was all there and was pretty good. My companions ordered the crispy beef which is think and hard pieces of beef that 's stir fried in a thai chili sauce with onions, bell peppers and carrots. The flavor was pretty good but the beef left something to be desired. The spicy shrimp dim sum looked pretty tasty and was a bit more like what I expected to see at a dim sum restaurant. SERVICEIt might just be a London thing, but some of the servers here also didn't speak very comprehensible English. I think they may have been from Eastern Europe and had a thick accent that made me resort to just pointing at the menu for what I wanted. OCCASIONI think Dim T is a nice, casual, not too fancy place to take friends for a nice view of the city. It wouldn't necessarily be the best date spot because the food is just okay.",

I also had the Asian Coleslaw as well this time which was very fresh and little bit sour; fabulous to have something without lashings of mayonnaise!We went around 6pm as well, so there was a happy hour for the beers and cocktails. The cocktails were a little sweet for me, and they were very fruit based. They weren't bad, I just like a more nuanced cocktail.The view is exquisite as well, you get a perfect spread of Tower Bridge through the windows upstairs.The only thing that I'm surprised about this time was the service. It was shot. When we arrived at 6.15 for our reservation we were the first ones to be seated upstairs as they had only just opened it. Therefore, because we were the only people up there, I can't explain why it took so long to get served?! It just makes no sense. There were a tonne of waiting staff up there, they all *looked* busy but I'm not sure how because there was no one to wait on up there apart from us. They took their sweet time getting to us to take our order and even longer to bring it over. Then even longer still when we wanted to pay our bill.Such a shame as I rarely ever relegate a place to the three star slot, but them's the breaks, Dim T.",

I actually saw our waitress sitting outside smoking a cigarette and when she came back in she went straight into the kitchen and grabbed our food, I hope she washed her hands! Needless to say, I won't be back, my husband enjoyed the noodles but I think nits overrated...I'm disappointed in the poor service.",

    "text": "Food was excellent, service... horrible. \u00a0Unfortunately I don't have the server's name but she just couldn't be bothered to wait on us. \u00a0We had to flag her down for everything - drinks, entrees, dessert, check - and she seemed as though she had better things to do than to serve us. \u00a0The final straw was when we ordered dessert and seemed to wait forever for it to arrive. \u00a0Finally \u00a0(about 10 minutes later) she comes with the check and when we inquire about our dessert she says that she put in the order and the chef said the kitchen was closed (it was the end of the day) so no dessert. \u00a0However, the charge for dessert was on the check so she had to take the check back to remove the charge. \u00a0Pathetic!The food, once we finally received it, was excellent.",

    "text": "Not sure how this place gets so many low ratings below. I've decided not to read them because they might taint my opinion.First off: the view! Oh my god is it good, straight out over the river with an unbroken line of sight to both the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. You need to ask to sit upstairs if at all possible, even though it was closed when we arrived the staff helpfully let us wait with a cocktail until we could go up.I think the prices are reasonable for the location, it certainly is economically closer to \u00a0its neighbour Strada than the mortgage requiring Gaucho on the other side. Think about a fiver for dim sum and starters and about a tenner for a main.The food was tasty without blowing me away, I really enjoyed the spicy edamame and you can't go wrong with a steamed pork bun. Also the menu is varied enough to pull me back to try other things.The service was friendly and attentive and overall I don't really have a bad word to say, definitely will be coming back.",
