However I asked and it turns out that, well, it's all in the cooking. I had the (meze) menu for 18.75 which was a selection of cold and hot plates, more or less like Spanish tapas -well as a concept that is. We also ordered a bottle of Moschofilero, which is a Greek white wine from Peloponnese with strong taste. This was at around 17 pounds. The service was the best that I have seen in London. At last somewhere where the tables are cleaned , not only after you leave but even when the courses are changed. They were also blazing fast at bringing our plates. One complain, which is the reason the fifth star could be missing. We were told that we had two hours to eat. Reasonable and it was in a very polite tone, still I didn't like it. All in all, highly recommended but book a table to avoid disappointment or a long queue.",

The location is lovely, Primrose Hill seems to get more than its fair share of sunshine, so the pavement tables are always packed. My first experience was one of dry chicken, good meze, fresh salads, so i thought i'd give it another go. So, one fine afternoon I popped in with a friend, hoping we could share a bottle of wine and some olives at one of the many outdoor tables. Shown to a table, we declined the menu, asking just for a bottle of wine as we had other plans for dinner later that evening. Sorry, you have to leave, you can't come here just for drinks. I wouldn't mind so much if they had been polite and apologised that drinks only is not their policy, would we care to order some food, but the tone was off-putting, so we left. I don't think any restaurant in London has left me quite so annoyed and unlikely to return!",

Lemonia looked like the perfect place and we were not disappointed.We ordered 2 starters and 2 mains plus a bottle of wine which came to around \u00a360 \u00a0it's not cheap but the setting and atmosphere of the restaurant and the attentive service made this totally worth it. we had a greek sausage dish and tzatziki with bread to start and chicken souvlaki and stifado for the main and everything was delicious. We didn't have room for dessert but the waiter bought us some Turkish delight at the end of the meal, which was a nice touch.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place and would go back in a heartbeat. If you are looking for somewhere to go as a treat and like authentic Greek dishes with good service then this is your place. I noticed that they also do a reasonably priced set lunch menu so I'll be checking that out very soon.",

One of the Cypriot waiters has worked at the restaurant for around 30 years, He gleefully informed grandpa that when you get to 100 you can get a free dinner. Never mind the telegram from Queenie, this is something for all of us to look forward to.They did unfortunately put the prices up a few years back making this place a bit more expensive, but it doesn't seem to hamper them one bit and it is consistently worth it. I am a sucker for anything charcoal grilled so the chicken shish is a favourite as is the haloumi. I recently tried the swordfish which was O M G good.Don't forget to order the rice pudding too. I guess birthday candles don't stand up very well in it, so they rather sweetly slash hilariously put one in a single square of Turkish delight for grandpa to blow out.This restaurant is packed out even midweek - we came here on a Wednesday and it was incredibly lively and busy. \u00a0Worth booking ahead to guarantee a table,",

The hummus was that good to start with we ordered another plate straight after! The vegetarian main course selection is a little thin on the ground (two main dishes from memory) so I opted for a few of the smaller vegetarian dishes and starters. Excellent value for money for such a good quality restaurant in a lovely area. I definitely would have scored it higher if there was a better food selection for the non meat eaters.",

It's a lot of classic dishes done simply, with cold mezze to start, then hot mezze, then a meat platter with rice and salad, (then Turkish delight if you get coffee!). For the other reviewers complaining about expense v portion size: this is where you have been going wrong. You will need a fast paced walk up Primrose Hill to ease your straining stomach after all that lot.The other two things I like about this place are the very nice woman front of house, and their fresh mint tea. In the 5 years or so I lived abroad I came here almost every visit home to catch up with one of my best friends, and we would sit way past the last of the lunch trade without ever once being even gently rushed out.

    "text": "Lemonia, you are a puzzle.A half dozen Yelpers showed up for dinner after a fun Yelp event. We were nearby, I hadn't had Greek food since moving to London and it had great reviews on Yelp, so I thought we should try it.So we go in and they give us a table. It was kind of hidden off to the side, which felt a bit strange. But they were busy so I didn't really think much about it at the time. There were some olives, carrots and radishes placed on the table for us to snack on while we were looking over the menu. It seemed like a weird mix of things to me, but I do love radishes, so I wasn't too concerned.I had the Spanikopita and some sort of stuffed eggplant thing. The Spanikopita were light and flaky with a deliciously lemony spinach and feta filling. The main was tasty, but not great. The turkish delight was wonderfully rose-water-y and pistachio-y. The only downfall for me was the service. It was just strange. After our starters came the waiter kind of just hovered around the table. Like stood there watching us eat. It was creepy, and a bit off-putting. When I finished my main, he swooped in and took my plate away. Now, I'm an American and I'm kind of used to that sort of thing in the US, but in the UK, they usually wait until everyone is finished. So it was just weird. Really weird.I'm not sure it was weird enough to put me off going back. If I were in the area and craving Greek food, I think it would be a great place to go. There were a lot of things on the menu that looked good and that I wanted to try.",

From the moment we stepped inside, it was all warm smiles and pleasant greetings. That attitude held throughout our entire luncheon. That's behaviour I can get behind!In addition to being so winningly lovely, Lemonia backs it all up with delightfully satisfying Mediterranean cuisine at an immensely reasonable price. A two course meal including a coffee or tea (and complimentary Turkish delights!) for roughly \u00a313 verges on being bargain material.I opted for a crab salad starter followed by a lamb stew main and was thoroughly pleased by both. In particular, the stew was rich, savoury, and filling - just the kind of grub to indulge in on a grey and rainy afternoon.Rumour has it that this has historically been a typical hangout for Kate Moss. I'm unclear how she can dine on the great Greek grub and keep her... svelte, shall we say?... figure. Clearly, my metabolism pales in comparison to hers.",

    "text": "I have wanted to dine at Lemonia for quite some time and finally got my opportunity late last night. This very popular Primrose Hill, Greek restaurant was as vibrant as ever. On being seated my lady and I were transported into what I can only describe as a stunning garden type restaurant. There were huge hanging baskets spilling over with dark green foliage, and although I have never been to Greece, I couldn't help but feel transported there. Every server was a character straight out of Grumpy Old Men. This really added something to the atmosphere. Being served by Old Greek men leads to a different vibe than if being served by a giggly 18yr old girl.There was only one choice for the food. We had the \u00a318.50 per head Mezze. Every dish was fresh tasting and decidedly yummy. The hummus we had was potentially the best I have ever eaten. Our three courses were served with precise timing and we were full to bursting by the end of the meal.I would definitely dine here again, and the quality of Lemonia comes out in it's atmosphere and food. It is certainly a cut above its little sister Limani.",

My mum and I went when she was here to visit, and it was one of our best meals on her trip.I had a mixed seafood skewer, which was delicious: tuna, swordfish (aren't those endangered or mercury ridden or something? anyhow, it was tasty), crab claw, scallop, prawn, and some veg all freshly and simply prepared on charcoal grill with a squeeze of lemon. Exactly how I want my seafood to be. We also had some tziki and pita, which was also yum-worthy.Considering the quality of the food, the prices are not bad either. It wasn't too busy for lunch, so maybe that is the better time to go if evenings are busy? It isn't the hippest spot as far as interior decorating goes, but I suppose that adds to its charm. Eat lunch here, sit in the park with some sunshine = perfect day.",

I liked the calamari, the crust was crunchy and the inside was also cooked just right. I also very much enjoyed the prawns salad. I remember the tuna spread being yummy and taking more than once the button mushrooms. The lamb in the lamb chops were cooked better than the ones on the skewers, which were a bit dry and chewy. The chicken on the skewers though were tender and scrumptious. Overall I had a lovely meal and got to try a variety of tastes. The restaurant is located on a cute and quiet street, and the space itself is large and comfortable. Our waiter was also very helpful and friendly.",

The smug monied media mass of Primrose Hill have Odettes and posh Greek charcoal grill Lemonia.It's been a local fixture for years, almost certainly in existence before the arrival of the creative agency types and the minor celebs attracted by the villagey vibe and bucolic rusticity of the little street off the top of Regent's Park. Sandwiched between delis and dress shops Limonia has a reputation above and beyond a thick menu of competent Greek cuisine. Arriving late, sodden with rain and lager, we managed to slide into one of the booths in the atrium at the rear, a table overhung with flourishing greenery from the low hanging roof planters.Mixed meze and pitta forgettably dealt with early hunger pangs. I went for a slow roast aubergine dish topped with a smooth paste of minced lamb and cheese, served on a bed of creamy spinach. Not accomplished cooking by any means but hearty fare in variance with the thin and fashionable regulars. A couple of companions, more regular habitu\u00e9s than I, went for lamb chops from the grill. Slim shards of perfectly crisped fat along the bone were a delight to gnaw, but the meat wasn't quite pink enough for us.. the charcoal grill giveth but it also taketh away. The accompanying chips and rice were largely and deservedly unnoticed.Right place at the right time? It's certainly got a place in local hearts and with the crowds it gets, the management won't be bothered that I'm not a super fan. I'd be happy to eat here again, but only if someone forces me to spend time in the many nearby bars first.",

All were delicious, but the tarama with pita was out-of-this-world good. Definitely get those as starters.For mains we got the pork souvlaki, lamb shashlik, chicken shashlik, kalamari fried, lentils, and okra. For dessert: baklava, vanilla ice cream, mix fruit platter, kataifi, and Turkish delight. All wine and food were great, especially the chicken. One caveat: I was not paying for dinner, so I can't speak to whether or not it was worth it. Going off of flavors and ambiance, though, I thoroughly enjoyed Lemonia!",

    "text": "People who rate this place 4 stars + have probably never been to Greece and have no idea what Greek cuisine is: lots of fresh food, large portions, sharing generous quantities of mezze, fresh fish and ouzo.This place is a decent restaurant with good, friendly service, but the food is simply overpriced and generally of poor quality.The waiter was really surprised when we asked what ouzo brands they had. \u00a0We were planning to order a bottle of 700ml -as you would normally do for a table of 4- but they only had tiny bottles of 20ml priced at \u00a317. \u00a0They see mezzes more like individual starters, rather than a proper mezzes...and again the quality was just average.They are probably second generation Greeks or don't understand the whole concept, or maybe they tried to adapt it to a British / international clientele but I am afraid this is NOT a Greek restaurant",

    "text": "Lemonia is a must-try if you are a Greek food connoisseur. I visited 13(!) years ago and convinced my family we must come during our trip a couple months ago, as it was very memorable the last time I was there. We were not disappointed! I had the appetizer portion of dolmades and they were the best I've ever had. For my entree I had the lamb with tomato sauce.... I can't remember the name exactly, arne de something? It was perfectly tender, practically falling off the bone, with the perfect amount of sauce--and I like a lot of sauce! My parents both ordered lamb dishes as well and were equally pleased. Our server Eric (who was GREAT, putting up with my very needy family) recommended the moussaka, which my sister ordered, and it was seriously incredible. I'd order that the next time I go back.We loved the complimentary rose-flavored Turkish delight. The baklava, while tasty, was a bit too sweet/honey-drenched for our taste.While the food was by and large perfect, an incident at the end put a little bit of a damper on the experience. We were all paid, stood up to leave, when a man (I'm guessing a manager since he was not dressed like the waitstaff) ordered us to wait while putting his arm up to stop us from moving to the entrance. Apparently he didn't believe we'd paid, because a credit card verification slip had been misplaced or something. Luckily we had the copy of the receipt and showed it to him, which was satisfactory I guess, but he then explained that the waiter was new (he might have even said an \"apprentice\" and that's why the receipt wasn't in the right spot. I work in the industry and have to say it's completely bizarre and unprofessional to reassign blame instead of taking responsibility or simply apologizing for the mix up. We didn't appreciate being treated like criminals and stared at by other patrons since by that point we were all already standing up from the table. I have to imagine that was a one-off event, but in the future management shouldn't throw waitstaff under the bus, and maybe have policy to let customers know if a server is new. Guests are generally very understanding/forgiving when the expectation has been set that the server might need a little assistance along the way.",

We had the starters and two mains, the seafood mixed grill and mixed meat grill, with the special greek drinks( I forgot the name lol) The meat and seafood are well cooked, very tender and tasty, espeicially the lamb. We also ordered two desserts, typically greek ones. However i found they're bit overcharged, we are four, \u00a335 per head.",

    "text": "B-list British celebs and equally dull food.So the food: Quail was dry and garnished like it was the 80's still. Saganaki was dry and expensive and boring. Aubergine mash/dip was bland and mealy. Bread was boring and dry. Salad had this awful sweet dressing on it. Bleh! I can't believe this is my local restaurant. So let down.The only good thing was the wine, probably because they didn't make it themselves. Why this place is so highly rated is simply beyond me.ps. Since the service is grudging at best, please stand up to the optional 12.5% service charge. Don't fall for this Britain- restaurants play of your social fear of looking cheap to get you to pay this. The service here can be seriously slow and the food is already way overpriced for what it is. Wait staff in the UK are paid a living wage and get national health. Most in London pay more as well. In America service workers often don't have health care, and rely on tips. Waiters in many American states can earn as little as $2.13 USD an hour- seriously. It is a totally different system in America, don't be a sucker and adopt it in Britain just because other countries do it.",

This has been here forever - I remember coming here as a primary school child with my parents when we were visiting London - so it must be doing some things right. The food is great - really delicious. At my most recent visit in October 2015, I had halloumi as a starter (grilled so it was perfectly flavourful) and then lamb souvlaki, which was marinated in olive oil and was tender and utterly tasty. Definite thumbs up.I think, though, that it's the quality you would expect for the price - a lot of the mains at around \u00a315, and while fine, not the most generous portions ever. And there's something about it that makes it feel like it's not quite sophisticated enough to warrant the price tag - presumably the main thing going for it is the Primrose Hill location, but it's a bit crowded and noisy to feel like a really decadent evening.",
