The only downside is that it's quite food-orientated, so don't expect to be able to lounge in comfort unless you're planning to eat. That said, the high bar stools are comfortable enough and there's plenty of space to sit outside if it's a nice day. I've never tried it, but apparently they do cookery courses on their top floor which, given the fairly high standard of their food, must be worth a look.",

Apparently the place has been there for hundreds of years and serves a nice selection of locally sourced English style pub food. Upon arrival we were nervous we would not be able to eat because the crowd was spilling out of the bar and onto the streets. Luckily for us, most of them were there only for after work drinks! We were quickly seated and I ordered a local bombardier IPA which had a nice bitter taste and my colleague had a green king IPA which he said was very good. It is worth noting, they have a lot \u00a0gluten free options, such as the Colchester Rock Oysters. They are served in a Cabernet and shallot vinegar sauce which was awesome, extra sauce please! The heirloom tomato salad and the minted jersey royals (baby potatoes with mint) were very fresh and a nice light start. My entree was a well prepared small portion of monk fish in curry sauce. The sticky toffy pudding, a traditional English desert, was sweet, well balanced by refreshing ice cream and just right for sharing. Overall really good British experience, especially thanks to our friendly and dry humored server :)",

We were staying at the May Fair, so it was a pleasant surprise to find the Footman just a few blocks behind us. I had the linguini with grilled vegetables for dinner, and promptly went back for Eggs Benedict the next day (because I dreamed about them). The flavor was good, the noodles were cooked perfectly (although they had a tad too much olive oil on them), and the veggies were wonderfully fresh after a week's worth of fried carbs. My friend had the pork medallions, which were really tender and well-seasoned. We ended the night with the bitter chocolate cheesecake and honeycomb ice cream. Unlike most cheesecakes, this sliver was just right in terms of sweetness. I really liked the ice cream. I was not, however, a fan of the butter brickle crumbles or whatever garnished the plate... too sticky on the teeth.",

To be honest, I came here sort of out of desperation (it's one of the few pubs in this area) and I only came as a launching point to meet friends before a night out in Mayfair. The staff was friendly and attentive and the beers and ciders on tap were pretty standard, but nothing really sticks out in my mind when I think of this pub. I didn't have the food, so can only speak to the pub from more of a drinking / ambiance feel which didn't thoroughly impress me. However, I would go back if I were in the area, just wouldn't go out of my way to visit.",

    "text": "In short this was a nice place with nice food almost ruined by one shit waitress. We went on a le cool walking tour and I'd already read about this place and was excited to try it out. The pub is quite upscale almost to the point where it's a restaurant with a bar on the side. They had a small television and even changed the channel for me so I could watch some rugby. Couldn't flag down a waitress so went up to the bar to order and immediately didn't care for the waitress. She had an elongated sigh that lasted the entirety of me ordering but I thought hey, everyone has an off day. Just when the food was arriving I was away from the table and came back to find that the venison pie I ordered was actually chicken. I called the same waitress over and asked if this was venison and she told me it was. I said it doesn't look like venison and she picked up the plate and walked away without saying anything. A few minutes later the manager came over and said sorry they're out of venison and the waitress should have said so I told him chicken was fine. They brought the plate back out which was now a cold pie and mash. He gave us a free drink, or rather he gave another drink and we left without paying for it. Overall this place is too pricey to be a gastropub and too uptight to be decent enough for a few drinks. A shame as it was nice and they had some good menu options. Just not in stock.",

The concierge of our hotel came to our rescue with The Only Running Footman as a recommendation so we set off to walk the 10 blocks or so to Mayfair to check this place out. Located in the middle of a quiet neighborhood, the Only Running Footman was a treat indeed. First of all, the place was packed as there were football playoffs on at the time and the locals were all rooting for their second choice favorite since their local team had already gone down in defeat. We opted to sit in the more casual pub area although there is a \"fancier\" restaurant upstairs as is often the case with pubs in London/ We scored a great seat by the window letting us look out on the street and perused the menu. There were several specials of the night but we opted for the fish and chips (yeah- I know- how touristy of us) and the stew. That and a couple of pints and we were extremely happy with our choices as the food was good and the beer cold. We ended up talking to a couple of the people next to us who actually worked at another place owned by the same people and they proceeded to close down the place with us. Friendly staff, good service and food that scored almost as many points as the Italians did that night! Next time I'm in London, I'll definitely stop back in.",

In fact, everyone involved with the conference rocked it. It was time to celebrate.I was hoping I'd get a proper pub experience while here, and while celebrating with the team, oh did I get it. Shortly after going up to the bar I made a new friend. Drinking since getting off work and quickly picking up on my American accent, we got right into it:- He and 25 of his friends, ah, make that mates are going to a stag (bachelor party in our version of English) in Las Vegas next year. He wanted some advice. My advice to Las Vegas: you have no idea what's coming. - He accused me of drinking water. After convincing him it was a gin & tonic, we were best mates.- He then accused me of bringing \"like\" and \"totally\" across the pond. I absolutely did not, and of course slipped in a \"like\" while defending myself. Fail.- We were back to best mates after another round. Some other pub character almost spilled a drink on me while waiting for my beverage. See proper experience, wanted, above. Thank you.- We ended the conversation bonding over Armin Van Buuren (he had just seen him, mind was blown) and sharing my jealousy he was seeing Above & Beyond in a few weeks. I think my music passion finally won him over for good. I can talk dance music with the best of them.So I got my proper pub experience: A celebration. A new mate. A drink almost spilled. A vibe that is uniquely London. To my new friend: I'll be back for that third round soon.",

The waiter was very nice, but misunderstood my drink order and gave me Italian beer rather than vodka. When I did get a vodka with orange soda, it was in fact vodka with orange juice and seltzer. We both had the fish & chips, which was served with smashed peas. It was wonderful! The \"tartar\" sauce was more of a creamy onion sauce and the peas weren't the sweet peas that I am used to, but I loved them both. Two thumbs up for food, middle of the road on the other fronts.",

    "text": "Thanks Yelp, another great find in London. We made reservation with TopTable only to find that it was for the ritzier upstairs. No worries, they let us sit in the more casual pub down stairs by the bar. Awesome service, very un-pub like in that way. Three of us shared the fish and chips. We loved the fish and the mushy peas, chips were average. But then on a whim we shared one order of their sticky toffee pudding! One was not enough, it was the best I ever had. Many puddings are way to sweet to eat more than a bite. This sticky pudding was perfectly addictive. I would return for this alone!",

    "text": "I always make it a point to hit this gem of a pub when I'm in London, and bring my colleagues along. I can't say enough good things about their fish and chips - especially on a cold day! Beer selection is a bit limited but I always find something I like. The last time I was in, an apparent keep favorite \"John\" was hanging out. John was VERY drunk for 6pm and didn't quite get the hint that I didn't have any desire to talk to him. Despite the obvious signs the keeps kept defending him saying \"Oh, you don't know John, John's a great man\"...if he was so damn great he'd leave me the hell alone! \u00a0Stop in for some fish and chips, and be weary of John - don't say I didn't warn you!",

    "text": "Well, on the last day of the Jubilee weekend, we were out and about with some visiting friends, and I decided we should go have dinner at a place I'd been wanting to try. So we went to Green Park, walked to the restaurant, to find that it was closed. Alas, no Burger and Lobster for me this time.However, The Only Running Footman was just around the corner, and thanks to the high Yelp rating, we dashed over here in the rain to have a few drinks and dinner. It's a gastropub, so it's trying to be a bit posher than your standard pub food. So, we all started with the foie gras and liver pate. It was delicious! I had the burger, and while it was a tasty burger, it wasn't anything special. The person who got the fish and chips raved about it (so much she ate it all without sharing). The person getting the pie said it was quite good. We also got dessert. I had the rhubarb crumble and it was fantastic. The cheese plate looked nice. The pavlova looked like the meringue was store bought (unfortunately). But the berries looked nice.There was a decent selection of ales (Green King IPA, Young's Bitter, and Bombadier) so things on that front were nice. If I were in the area, and we felt the need for a bit of gastropubbing, this would probably be the place we'd go!",

The pastry on the pie was deliciously flaky but I have a pet peeve about pies that have no bottom crust. This one did not and it needed it! The gravy inside was really flavorful though and the chicken had a tenderness to it that was nice. Steak sandwich was good but nothing special. The nice addition was the fries (not chips, i.e. thin fries!) which were super crispy.Wouldn't go back for the food but they do pour a fine Guinness which I would certainly return for and their real ale selection was also noteworthy.",
