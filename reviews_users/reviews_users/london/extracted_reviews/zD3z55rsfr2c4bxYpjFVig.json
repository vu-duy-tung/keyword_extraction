They really did name their business Phat Phuc and quite aptly too, as if you ate here every day and night, you may very well be. Located on Sydney Street, it's literally behind the gorgeous flower stall so you have to go down some stairs to get to it. Seating is outdoors, so it thrives in the summer but can be a bit chilly in the winter to sit there and manage chopsticks but my god, it is tasty! The chicken pho is really fresh and tasty and I'm generally a fan of pho and you can take away, which I used to do many a time when I worked in the area. I love that there are some diehard regulars who will eat here rain or shine, which adds to the whole appeal I think, because they love it so much, they don't mind the cold. I've always wolfed down my meals here in a lunch break but I bet it is just bliss when you can sit in the sunshine and just enjoy. If you're ever in the area and want a decent cooked meal, you should definitely come here as it is totally worth every penny!",

She totally recommended it, and I'm always down to try anything once, so we came along.After trying to figure out what to get (the laksa was on my list), I opted to get the chicken noodle salad as it was a fairly warm day, and I had a heavy dinner planned that night, so salad, right? I also got some edamame because I can't really say no to them. Add some sparkling water and it's a great meal.Erica ordered the pork and rice special. They were both really delicious. The salad was light and refreshing, but still had all that spicy and sweet goodness that I expect from Asian food. The edamame was fine, but some of the pods looked a bit freezer burned. Since it was a nice day, the outdoor seating was fine, but I imagine in the cold or the rain, the lack of indoor seating might be a bit of an issue.I don't know if I'll be back in the area any time soon, but if I need a quick, easy and delicious lunch, I'll definitely look into heading back to Phat Phuc.",

The staff was really nice though, and despite essentially being a food card in a nice little hideaway courtyard off Sydney street, it offers sufficient covered seating for people who want to dine-in. Pho used to be a hangover's delight after those hardly-working nights back in university, so I've had quite a bit of experience dining in Vietnamese restaurants and usually there are several more pho options other than beef, chicken, and prawns. \u00a0Maybe I shouldn't expect much since it's really just a food cart, but at the same time they could offer other ingredients that I've seen in pho before, or at least provide more of the ones they have in the menu options they have. Overall it wasn't as filling as I would have liked, but I wouldn't say that I wouldn't come here again. \u00a0It's location is convenient, and the name is incredibly clever, but I think this is just one of those places that's trapped between being a food card and an actual restaurant. \u00a0For as large as the seating area is, I would think that the menu had more pho options available. If you've never had Vietnamese before, I would say that this place is worth a try, but if you're a veteran of pho then you'll likely be disappointed.",

Flat rice noodles were cooked al dente. Noodles had no flavor. Broth was highly salty. \u00a0I was jet lagged, tired & starving so every drop was consumed. But I wouldn't walk the 1.5 miles from my rental flat to eat here again. But happily my lovely wife ordered the big duck salad. It was brimming with ingredients, was sparkling fresh and had a medley of flavors that danced, skipped and sang. Best salad I've tasted in quite a while, big compliment from me, I live in Northern California. Cute little patio dining area. Walls are clear vinyl. Owner & cooks are friendly, happy & courteous. Prices are bargain ( for London ).",

It was described as a spicy noodle soup with coconut base. I thought it would be like Tom Yum with noodles, but the soup was thicker, more like Thai Curry with Noodles. Not that it was bad! Just not what I was expecting.The price was very affordable and the portions were plentiful. If you're in the area, you should definitely come by!",

It certainly is a popular spot amongst the apparent locals but for me, I've had better.Whilst the menu has a few different selections of the staples, I was hoping to find more custom Pho bowls as they only had beef, chicken, duck and vegetarian. No beef slices or meatballs, just the thick cuts of brisket which were not very tender. They also add all the toppings for you, rather than let you top and season your own. One size fits all.I found the broth good but not great, lacking a bit of depth that is generally found when it's been sitting for several hours. It was a good meal that warmed me up on a cold winter day, however it didn't satisfy my Pho craving completely and isn't worth another walk in the rain.",
