I've eaten before at the Soho Masala Zone, and loved the food, which is why I was so disappointed with the quality of the same chain in Islington. I went with a friend to have a Sunday lunch, and the service was rather slow - she had to go to the counter to ask someone to take our order. We ordered a starter and two dishes - the mains were uninspiring in their combination of different flavors - the essential component of Indian food. In fact, everything seemed to have been made with the same mix of spices. But the starter made with chickpeas was quite good, sweet and tangy with a yogurt dip. I hope they bring this place up to the centrally based Masala Zone standard soon.",

And your papadam so delicate!How can I thank you? This is the only way. Until we meet again!PS. I don't think Masala Zone is even trying to be the best, most authentic and high end Indian in the London market. So love it for what it is (and stop with the critical ratings)-- an easy way to get an amazing variety. And a perfect spot to try Indian for the first time. It's like the tapas of Indian foods.",

But when I found one in my food last week at Masala Zone I quietly told the waiter and said that I was informing him just to let the kitchen know to be careful. I didn't ask for a discount or make a big stink, I just put my plate aside and waited for my partner to finish his meal. The waiter was thankful at first but then after speaking to the staff in the kitchen he basically came back to the table and accused me of dreaming it up as there would never be a hair in the food. I didn't want to pick at my plate to show him as I had buried it under some food but I told him to do so in the kitchen if he wished, I felt a bit sick at this point. I was shocked but was so tired that day that I didn't cause a fuss, I was just floored at the poor service and how they handled that; if I wasn't with a terrible cold I probably would've had words with the manger but I didn't. They gave us 10% off our bill - which was also absurd! I was a fan of Masala Zone but shall not be returning ever again -not because the food isn't great, I still think it is but how they treated a customer who was quietly informing them of something amiss with their meal was done all wrong. Customer service training should be given to the staff there.",

There was 7 of us and we all had Thalis \u00a0we were all still suffering a bit from new year's eve so Thalis were the safe and easy choice as you get a bit of everything. I chose Goan prawn as the main curry with the Thali, and got two vegetable dishes, a poppadom, a chapati, some salad and sauces. One of the vegetable dishes was lentil and was good, the other had potatoes in and was red (I'm guessing tomatoes?) and was not very tasty. The prawn curry was average at best. It feels to me like this place is more focused on marketing and interior design than having great tasting food. If you want a good curry in Islington Roots @ N1 is a million times better",

This is by far some of the worst Indian food I have ever eaten, and I've been to some pretty crappy Indian restaurants over the years. The service was mediocre at best, they were a little pushy and not exactly polite or friendly. The menu. Someone here said it's varied and has a good choice?Have you ever been to a real Indian restaurant? The menu is terrible, the selection of curries is very narrow and they don't even have peshwari naan. I ordered the butter chicken, my friends ordered the korma and the lamb thali. The butter chicken was passable, but the chicken was a little strange and the rice didn't taste freshly cooked. The garlic naan was strangely flat and false tasting. Not nice and light and fluffy as you'd expect. I tried the korma and the thali as well. The thali was passable too, not good, but edible. The korma on the other hand, wow, sinking to a new level of terrible. It tasted like one of those microwave curries you'd get from a supermarket for a quid. The sauce was horrible and the chicken had chewy nasty bits in it. If you want good modern Indian food in North London, try the Tiffin tin or Dinnerbox. If you're going to eat out on Upper street, why choose this place when there are so many great, real restaurants in this area?! (the fig and olive for example is brilliant)",

You get a couple vegetarian canapes, dal (lentils), a chapati, cucumber raita (a yoghurt based condiment) and a choice of one of their main curry dishes. This I do like, however, there have been times where the curries have not been wholly satisfactory and lacked the kind of spice you would expect a good Indian curry to have.

Hungry and annoyed, I was already writing this review in my head, but I have to be fair, their customer service was great. They happily replaced our food, this time it took a bit longer that 15 mins to get to us..which weirdly, was reassuring. It still wasn't hot tho, it never is and I don't know why! They then called us twice to check we were happy and offerered us a discount off our next order. So back to the question of why do I keep ordering? It's so damn tasty!!! It's really really good.

It was not terrible not it was incredible. What I can say for sure is that I was stuffed like a turkey in Christmas. I could barely move when I finished my huge plate.

    "text": "Delivery order made from the website. The food was disappointing to say the least and the portions were shameful. The Honey and Dill Prawns Main -- \u00a3 15.20 -- was just plain offensive: 4 prawns and a rather pathetic garden salad with a vinaigrette on the side. Unbelievable! The Goan Crispy Fried Prawns were soggy and the Delihi Vegetable Korma was runny and mainly liquid -- not much by way of substance at all. The 'Dal of the Day' was ridiculously oily and garlicky. This was an epic failure of a meal whose only upside \u00a0was prompt delivery. Absolutely will not order again and will most certainly share this horrid experience to spare other potential diners this nasty fate. Also, the site's captcha code is ridiculous indecipherable as is the audio option so they have 'gamed' their own feedback mechanism. Pretty shady stuff.",

    "text": "I give 3.5 stars.I came here with three friends before going to a late Proms concert. The name made me skeptical but I was really pleased with the food. It was very tasty and satisfying - I got a thali with a chicken dish I can't remember the name of - it had cilantro and was spicy. OMG it was SOOOO GOOD and the naan was excellent. I'd definitely go back for the food.The one thing that worried me was the service. We said we were in a hurry because we had a concert to catch, and it still took a very long time to get our food. When we asked the server about it, she said it was because one person in our party had ordered skewers, and it states in the menu that it takes 15 minutes for those, but this was after at least 30 minutes of ordering so I didn't buy it.Other than that, everything was great! They seem to take pride in their menu and take the time to explain everything, and I liked that a lot.",

    "text": "Out by myself and so I did not want to dine at one of the super trendy places alone, and so this looked good. I ordered three street foods and a non-alcoholic cocktail and thought two out of my three dishes and my drink were really fantastic: the bhel, a sprouted lentil, cucumber, peanut, chickpea vermicelli salad that was sweet, spicy, and delicious; the smashed samosa with chutney and raita. Excellent service, nice decor, and a very comfortable place to dine alone. My only complaints were that 1) there was no dosa on the menu (I hear \"masala\" and cross my fingers for the pancakes!) and 2) I am not sure that the third item I ordered is what I got (it was supposed to be something with caramelized onion Indian bread but was a toasted brioche and lentils and tomatoes.... ok, but not as subtle and interesting as the other two. Overall, the price seemed pretty reasonable too.",

I've no idea if the food was authentic or not, but to be honest \"authenticity\" is not a quality I really value highly in foreign food. I just value good quality ingredients and want it to taste good to my somewhat unadventurous palate. \u00a0I had a kurma but it was a lot less sweet than I was expecting and I'd have preferred the meat to be marinated in the sauce rather than served separately. I think this place just wasn't for me.",

So given that I can tell the place lives up to my taste buds. I knocked one star as the portions are little less to my liking and prices are higher for the portions they serve. But hey we are planning to visit again very soon as taste matters in the end. I had the masal chai \u00a0and chicken biryani which came with a dal(we don't eat dal with biryani) but it still tasted good and yoghurt both are yum.",

The thalis come in fantastic delivery trays and the food is always wonderful, especially as a vegetarian. Occasionally the lentil dishes can be a little too watery, and the side dishes in the thalis can be very spicy or overly oily sometimes too but these are very small complaints. Most of the time the food is as good as when you eat in and is fantastic value with great service.",
