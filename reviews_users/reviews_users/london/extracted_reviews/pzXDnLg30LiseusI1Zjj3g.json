    "text": "This particular Real Greek is a restaurant of contrasts. Whenever i have walked by this place on my way to or from the Tate Modern, i have always been tempted to go in. Bright lights, a sparkling colourful interior and full of people. I resisted the temptation for weeks, and then one day i gave in, and i regretted it.My initial thoughts were that the service was good, unlike what many of the previous reviewers had experienced ... which gave me hope that they would have improved in recent times. The other customers were being served their mezes in tiered dishes. It looked fun.I ordered a simple rose wine and asked for some tap water. The wine arrived promptly but the water didn't. After some time i reminded the waiter of the missing water and he said that it was there ... in the hour-glass shaped opaque container that i had mistook for the salt. Stupid me !!!The wine was strong and good ... but that would be too much to say for the food. I ordered the grilled octopus as a starter. Although it was listed in the menu as a hot meze, it wasn't really hot. The meat was hard and tough, not the way i think it should be (based on my limited experience of eating octopus and an extensive experience of eating squid). It took some effort to chew the pieces ... and to top it all, it was bland. The effort to chew went unrewarded.The pork souvlaki that i got for the main course was also nothing to write home about. I liked the bread and the vegetables in the wrap more than the meat ... which was again hard and inedible.The quantity of food was decent, though it looks deceptively small. One redeeming aspect was that they didn't make me wait too much for the dishes and also it was cheaper than many other restaurants in tourist spots are. I shelled out \u00a317 for the wine, starter and the main course. Another interesting thing was that the real greek accepts tips only in cash. You can't add them on while paying by card.The looks deceived me this time, but it won't again. Next time when i return from the globe, i will rather get into the pizza express next door.",

    "text": "Located in prime position right on the South Bank, this is a quaint and inviting Greek restaurant. The most wonderful thing about the Real Greek is the multitude of outdoor seating, so as your ambling down the South Bank it's hard to resist the smells and sight of patrons enjoying their food. Food is delivered to your table on tiered metal serving plates, a novel idea and adds an element of fun to your eating experience. The food itself is ok; i always order from the Mezze menu opting for piles of bread with hummus and babaganush. One thing that you should be prepared for is the waiting. Service is slow. Really slow. So don't go here if you're really hungry, it's far more suited to nipping in for a snack after exploring the South Bank. I would recommend you pop in here one summers day, if you're patient it's worth it.",

I was still excited but after about 25 minutes waiting for my starters whilst all other tables seem to be being served left me feeling a little annoyed. The freshly made humus and taramasalata were really divine, they came with greek flat bread.Our mains, however, were... just disgusting. I didn't enjoy anything we'd ordered. Most of the food was oily, some a little cold and served garishly, without much care.I would say this was a real disappointment. There are many places to eat on the Southbank, this does not have to be one of them!",

    "text": "You get great views of the Thames from this branch of what has become a successful chain of Greek eateries. I stopped off at this one with a friend when we were overcome with hunger whilst walking along the South Bank. You can sit outside (Thames side) if you fancy an al fresco meal, but the temperature can drop quite quickly in the evening even in Summer, and the outside gas heaters aren't quite enough to compensate. We had a really weird waiter, who proved quite difficult and more or less ignored us. However, when we did manage to get our order in, the food was very tasty if a bit expensive (and the portions not very generous). I'd say you were paying for the riverside views, but then I've also eaten at the Hoxton branch which is just as expensive but has no views whatsoever! I'd recommend the taramasalata which is made in-house and a natural pale pink (makes a change from the bright pink stuff you see in shops). It's one of the best I've ever tasted. The Greek red wine was surprisingly good (we avoided the retsina as I'm not a fan). The only problem with the food was that a side order of chips was so hot that the first chip I tasted burnt the roof of my mouth off (and my mouth hurt for several days!). I should have complained but it was so hard to get the waiter's attention anyway, I couldn't be bothered. Just watch out for HOT chips!",

A menu of typical Greek foods, meant for sharing with pitas and various dips there are no surprises. The location though, is lovely. Right on the South Bank with easy access for an afternoon walk to the Tate Modern and stunning views of the city over the Thames. The usual hustle of people in this area makes it pleasant to sit at the large windows and watch the crowds. The open kitchen makes you feel more involved with the restaurant itself. All in-all a pleasant experience, with predictable food in a friendly environment.",

    "text": "One of my favourite restaurants. Be warned - this is NOT tradional Greek food. No slow-cooked lamb shanks, moussaka etc. The Real Greek is all about the meze! Modern Greek food that's meant to shared. The decor is modern - lots of stainless steel and cool colours - and this branch located on the Southbank near the Globe Theatre, it is usually very busy in the evenings. Order from a selection of hot and cold meze served on separate plates, stacked one on top of the other on stainless steel stands. The Tiropitakia (spinach and feta pies) and Feta Bourgioudi (melted feta in a tomato and onion sauce) are highlights. Order at least 3 plates per person and share. If you don't order enough on the first round simply order more. The staff are friendly and service is usually good. Unfortunately they've just revamped the menu and removed 1 of the best dishes - the hot cheese balls which were incredible (if a health risk. Maybe that's why they removed them?) so I can't give 5 stars. Maybe I'll start a petition get the cheese balls back. All said, it's a great place to sit and enjoy an evening of good food, Greek wine and views iof the river.",

The bread was hard as a rock, over cooked. I wondered if it had been heated up from the day before. The new potatoes were actually not edible, the skins were just filled with mush, as they were so overcooked.Sorry, this was just not nice food. I know it's not an expensive restaurant, but you do expect to actually be able to eat the food that you've paid for. I wanted to take my partner for a nice meal and left feeling quite hard done by.What a shame.",

The menu is expansive and has all your Greek favourites such as meze, sovalki and salads. Food is pretty much what you would expect from a Greek Taverna and authenticity is increased by the selection of Greek wines available including Retsina. This is a great spot for people watching and is good for groups as you can get a variety of meze to share.",

    "text": "I'm not sure how The Real Greek on the South bank works, but it does, well kind of. It simultaneously offers 'real' Greek food and a modern stainless steel setting which you probably wouldn't think go well together, but somehow it manages to pull the combination off. Maybe it's because the food isn't really (in the traditional sense) that Greek, so you aren't left craving a homely setting with Sakis Rouvas crooning away in the background. Maybe this trendy approach to Greek cuisine is why it's so popular.I've called in here a few times with friends after meandering along the South bank and it's always full with an upbeat atmosphere. On a weekend there's always a a slight queue at the door though, you can book, but I don't think it's worth more than a spur of the minute visit. When there's room they sit you at the the bar whilst you wait for an available table. I've sat in both booths, which are really comfy for larger groups, and on the smaller steal tables for two that are also good as you can nosey into the open partition of the kitchen form here. And guess what, there isn't a plump looking Greek mama toiling away in sight.OK, so The food isn't as good as my grandma's, but there are a few things that taste surprisingly authentic. We usually have 'souvlakia' (marinated, grilled meat, wrapped in a pitta) and the 'meze', preferring to pick at a lot of different things. I recommend the 'tzatziki' (a cucumber and garlic dip) and the 'fassolia' (giant beans served in a tomato and garlic sauce) both are pretty spot on. I also like the way the dishes are served, stacked up on a metal rack. It's touches like this that male it a fun experience whilst still having a little taste of the Med.",

We were served tepid beers when we wanted something ice cold, given this was the hottest day of the year so far, and when we complained the waiter claimed they had come straight out of the fridge. The food was mostly good but there is something about Greek food, a certain flavour or acidity to it which I can't put my finger on, which I don't like and it was very prevalent in some of the mezze, particularly the pasty style ones",

    "text": "Lovely Greek restaurant along the River. The menu consists of cold and hot small plates that you can pick and choose from. There's also the option to do a set menu, but I got drawn in by the pork belly and octopus do opted for a la carte. We really enjoyed the grilled octopus, watermelon and haloumi salad ( seasonal) and branched out the try the cod roe dip. The pork belly eat tasty but on the dry end a bit for me. Make sure to get flat bread to eat everything with. The dishes \u00a0come in a 3 tier each, feels like a Greek high tea (yes, bit too much a romantic I know)! I also had the Greek mountain tea, which appeared to be an herbal tea. Not sure what the herb is but it was very refreshing and a great complement to the strong flavors of the plates.",

    "text": "I love Greek food, but this spot seemed a washed out, toned down version of it. Lots of options which will please a large group, or a mix matched group with different tastes, but ultimately the food itself was fairly boring.I got the halloumi salad which was the healthiest thing on offer, but not very healthy at that - not a shred of lettuce or green in there (despite the menu's promise of a bed of spinach), but lots and lots (and lots) of onion. I love onion but between the actual sliced onion and the slaw, it was more onion than anything else. Also, there was a potato salad heaped into the salad, so that was also a lot of mayo for a salad. I was just looking for something fresher and lighter, and there just weren't enough fresh veggies here. Most of the rest of the table ordered from the lunch specials Greek trio menu, which is a nice way to get exactly what you want: some kind of dip or sauce to choose from like tzsaki or hoummous, a spicy feta dip, etc and pita. Next you choose your grilled meat of choice (though I would strongly advise against the sausage - it looked terrible) and a side such as rice, cous cous, that slaw that came in my salad (which I don't recommend) or chips ... because this is England dammit, and chips are always on the menu. (Actually if they had something nice, like covered them in feta and traditional Greek spices, I would love that - a blending of the cultures, instead of just like throwing it on the menu to please the less adventurous). It sounds pretty great, right? The thing is it just wasn't. It was bland, greasy and lukewarm, and priced more for its location than its flavor and quality. So.... this typical chain spot on the river is a \"I don't want to have to think about it, I just want to eat now\" choice, but better lunch is to be had.",

Meze was great, I enjoyed the diversity of food on my plate, followed by Lamb with small potatoes and young carrots - a very simple but delicious dish. The sauce was excellent, moist and with right amount of acidity as for my taste. The whole experience was complimented with a wonderful pecan cheesecake that was specially modified for us to add the pistachio ice cream to it, which in my mind was perfect addition. The view on the Thames just added to overall experience. Thank you to the staff as well for being when we needed them.",

    "text": "This was my first meal in London! I wasn't expecting to eat Mediterranean food while I was in London, but I am glad I gave this place a try. This restaurant is at a nice location. It is near the Globe Theatre, near the river. We were lured into the restaurant by the samples that the chef was cooking in the patio. My friends tried the grilled pork that they were offering and thought it was delicious. So we decided to eat there. We got the peloponnese, which is a combination of cold and hot meze for two people to share. There were four of us so we ordered two of those! We got to try their watermelon and feta salad, greek flatbread, hummus, chicken skewer, halloumi skewer, tiropitakia, lamb kefte, falafel, etc. This is perfect if you want to try a bunch of different items on the menu! We were thrown off by the halloumi skewers. We thought it was some type of fish but it was cheese instead. I did not try it but my friends did not like the texture of the cheese. The lamb kefte was my favorite! I also liked the watermelon and feta salad because it was quite refreshing. I wish the ratio of watermelon to feta was more like 2:1 rather than 1:1. The hummus is different from the hummus I have in the states, which isn't a bad thing. It is coarser and has more of a bite to it. The hummus that I get from the states is a lot creamier.We were especially pleased with the service. The servers here are very friendly. At one point, my friend dropped the whole plate of lamb kefte. One of the servers came by and cleaned it up for us right away. She even got us a new plate of lamb kefte! They also immediately cleaned up the empty dishes on our table to prevent any more plates from flying off our table! Overall, the food was good and the service was excellent. The restaurant is located right by the riverside. It is a good place for dates because you can sit in the patio complement your meal with the lovely view.",

So when we had came back we quickly scheduled in some time to stop by our favourite restaurant. We where meeting friends there, we arrived first and was shown to a table. We sat and waited for our server to take our drinks order.... we waited and waited and waited till finally she came over. The place was not busy. It was 4:30 on a Monday afternoon. Friends arrived and it took her 5 minutes to find our table again to take their drink order... we ordered the our food and was not quite the same. \u00a0The flat bread are now these dry prices of bread with herbs thrown on and the new potatoes were over cooked. I also had to ask the food runner for more drinks as our server had disappeared again. Once the meal had finally finished and all our plates were cleared and dessert was refused. We all pulled our cards out to pay (the universal sign you would like to pay and leave). Surprise, surprise our server deceived that her conversation with her colleagues in the bar was more important..... so we gave up pulled another server over from another section paid the bill and left.... I could have voted the food a 3 but the server was so non existent, it too left a bad taste in my mouth.",

The dukkah chicken wings is described as coated in homemade dukkah - a spicy mix of ground, dry roasted nuts and seeds and served with smoked chilli relish. But what mix of spice? It just tastes like chicken, and it was a bit pinkish in the middle like it wasn't cooked enough. Put me off from returning to this place.

It has a great vibe and a really nice view out onto the Thames. They're pretty good with allergies too with gluten free options marked clearly on the menu. The haloumi is delicious, as is the lamb, pork, octopus and the greek salad. I wouldn't say it's super authentic and the food did seem a little greasy but overall it was decent food.

The hot meze included a lamb kefte, which was perfectly seasoned and very juicy, and new potatoes in olive oil and herbs. The food was delicious and well-prepared. The service was not great - it was very slow, and a bit odd. I think there was a lack of communication between servers. At a couple of points, we were brought other tables' food that we had to turn away. Both times we were waiting for our bill, which took asking three different servers and waiting about 20 minutes.
