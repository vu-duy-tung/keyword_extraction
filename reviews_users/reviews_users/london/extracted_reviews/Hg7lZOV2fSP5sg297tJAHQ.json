We \u00a0went here for a drink when Vibe and the other brick lane places were full and got a cool orange leather booth to ourselves. The music was brilliant, I loved every song; a mixture of Kings of Leon, Rolling stones and the killers. The drinks aren't that expensive either. I had a miller light on draught which was less than \u00a33 and my friend had a mojito for \u00a37.50. The bar staff are really nice and actually really smiley, none of that sulky serious stuff.Next time I go I'm going to reserve a bowling lane because it looked like so much fun. I'm going to be back very soon.",

The crows is youthful and loud, typical of a bowling alley.On Friday and Saturday night, a DJ will be playing a set whilst people bowl, eat junk food, drink and party, it is a great vibe. Its an American diner/ sports lounge, colourful and loud.What is great, is that its surrounded by other cool places in Brick Lane, and there is so much more to do in the area when the place closes, the latest it will ever close is 12.30.The last time I went to the All Stars, I had cocktails for the whole night, which are around \u00a37-8. There were a few of us that night, and if in the scenario one of us didn't want to bowl, there would have been no problems as so much is going on in here. It's a good night out at the All Stars, and not too damaging on the pocket.",

My complaint is with the usual British-restaurant meanness: when I pay \u00a39 for a burger and you charge me an extra 50p for bacon, please don't come back with one measly, shrivelled rasher. It makes you look tight, which you clearly are. Luckily, anyone feeling ripped off can bowl away the pain.",

I wasn't expecting it to be as pleasant being a Saturday night, the bar was nicely busy and the staff were polite in acknowledging you. Even the punters were an amiable bunch and not poseurs. Almost seemed like it wasn't London! Table service on the lanes was non-existent mind you. We were a large group and were seated after bowling for dinner. The staff were polite and seamless, the menu had just the right amount of choice. I wouldn't usually order a salad but I did anyway and was surprised that it was reasonably priced, fresh, tasty, main ingredients were not frugal and generous portioning. Hats off to the chef for keeping his/her charges up to scratch! The food came quickly and no orders were messed up. My fellow dinners were also satisfied with their meatier choices. I would come here again, I just hope that it wasn't a one off! One thing missing on the menu that would have made the experience complete, the all-American root beer!",

I waver on my review here, and I need to explain why.+ Amazing American bowling experience!- Nobody in London knows how to follow polite bowling etiquette (read: the fellow customers can be annoying)!+ Oreo milkshake! Butterfinger candy bar!- High prices for food!+ Able to bowl two games because the folks after us didn't show!- Only booked one game because nobody told us we were booking per game!+ Great location, in the heart of Shoreditch!- Have to make a reservation two weeks in advance because it's so popular!Okay, so you can see--it's splitsies. It's a fun experience, but really quite expensive. Kind of a token thing to do, but maybe not the only place you can have the experience, and certainly won't have to pay so much. I'm glad other reviewers have had a good time here--I'm probably being a bit harsh, because I did enjoy myself, but all of these things are worth noting. I'd love to come back for karaoke and to enjoy the bar and diner areas.",

    "text": "This is the best bowling experience I've had in London so far. It is pricier than Bloomsbury Bowling Lanes, but definitely worth it. I came here on a birthday party, which it's ideally suited to. Immediately as you enter there's a restaurant-type space that we skipped past to the bowling lanes. There aren't many bowling lanes there (four to six I think) and they're slightly shorter than standard-issue ones, but that's made up for by the excellent atmosphere: dimmed lighting and above all, when I was there, a superb funky soundtrack laid down by a DJ in the corner behind the bowlers. Off to the left there's a American-themed bar selling beers, soda floats, milkshakes and similar.After bowling our party headed for the karaoke rooms. The song list isn't as impressive as Lucky Voice's, and it has the quirk of listing different versions of the same song (e.g.Jeff Buckley's and Alexander Burke's versions of 'Hallelujah'. Did Burke add a new verse or two of 'Ooooooh's?), but it does the job. The ceilings in the rooms are high too, allowing taller clients to round off their musical expressions by standing on the seats, if they so desire.. One of the stand-out features of my experience there however was the drinks service, which was friendly, prompt and generous: our server allowed us plenty of extra time in our room after a delay, including not intervening when we changed our last song mid-way through after realising we'd made a mistake. Heck, he even sang along with us!Overall? I can't wait to have a party of my own here.",

    "text": "Although it lives in the shadows of it's big sister, Grease 2 did give us the classic tune- 'Let's Bowl!'. Not familiar with it? Let me be your Michelle Pfeiffier circa 1978-Let's bowl, let's bowl, let's rock-'n-roll.Hey, come on, let's get this show on the road.Let's bowl, let's bowl, let's rock-'n-roll.We're sittin' on a bomb that's about to explode.Sadly lyrics alone fail to describe the true catchiness of this tune. Once it's in your head it's there all day. A-L-L D-A-Y. And so it was that a brief off hand joke about knocking over the recyling bottles with a galia melon that I was inspired, no compelled, to make a trip down to the newest All Star Lanes Brick Lane style.Being a big fan of American kitch, I was quite excited about visiting this bowling alley come diner come cocktail bar and asthetically at least it didn't disappoint. From the waitress' outfit to the old school tunes, this was 1950s Americana at it's best. I challenge anyone not to raise a smile when Go Johnny Go Go comes on the jukebox!Food-wise, All Star Lanes is pretty decent too. As well as a classic burger and steak selection, a little thought has clearly been put in to including a few posh salads and tasty pasta's. The booze menu is also fairly impressive ('Elderflower and Gin- who knew you would be such a delicious party in my mouth?') and so it was at this point that my expectations for the bowling itself were growing through the roof.Sadly it was here that I was disappointed. Having waited two hours for a lane (we foolishly hadn't booked) we were anticipating a marathon bowling session to truely establish the all time champion bowler. Twenty minutes, \u00a313 and one game later we realised it wasn't to be. Yup, you gotta pay for these trendy surroundings! \u00a36.50 per game, per person and a standard booking of only one game per couple- we found the whole thing a little anti-climatic. Especially after I rolled a gutter ball four times in a row...And so it is with that warning that I give a dubious Yelp recommendation. Do please go, enjoy the food and drinks, the music and quirky uniforms BUT book ahead, take your wallet and make sure you're not rushed into a one-game-blink-and-you'll-miss-it bowling blimp!",

You really need to order a side with their main dishes (my friend ordered the chicken schnitznel and also needed to order a side with that), and at \u00a33+ for sides, and \u00a311.95 (for my fish cake), this makes a fairly pricey meal for what is essentially american diner food. the food also came alarmingly quickly, which always worried me. i am sure it was all reheated, but it actually tasted alright, so it was fine. the service is what really shines in here - the guys looking after us were really lovely, and once we finished our meal, we ordered a bottle of wine and they were perfectly happy to leave us for the next couple of hours whilst we chatted over that., they didn't even ask us to settle up the bill until we were done, which i appreciated.it is huge in here, so you'd probably only need to make reservations on the weekend. having tasted their cocktails (although not this time), i can also vouch for them, and think they are definitely reasonably priced. i like the atmosphere in here, was happy to see that the grim toilets i encountered on a previous visit were no longer in such a horrible state, love the service and cocktails, but wish that the food was a little cheaper.i might even return here at some point to give bowling a go!",

You really step out of Shoredtich and into another world here.But perhpas my all-star moment was realizing that their signature margarita is named Tommy's after Tommy's Mexican in the Richmond district in San Francisco! I'm sure others around me were wondering why I was freaking out and taking multiple pictures of the menu and description. So now you know. If only London could make a decent enchilada and tamale platter to go with that marg.",

    "text": "All Star Lanes looks the business but I think they've put style over substance.Bowling is feels like you're on a conveyor belt and that they want you in and out so the next group of people can be swooped in. I also struggled with the bowling as I'm quite small and have small hands and the range of bowling balls is very limited. Left with a bit of an arm/wrist injury a la Justin Lee Collins. There are private lanes but I have no idea how much these cost and if it's much different from what you get in the main area.Food is typical diner fayre. The restaurant is often very busy so book. Went here last minute and there were no tables but we were offered tables in the bar area where you can also order food. We had issues with one of our group being told they were no longer allowing the bar area to order food as the kitchen was too busy. Frankly deal with it! If you serve food you are bound to get busy at a peak time, customers are often fairly understanding when it's super busy. Secondly when a complaint about the coleslaw was off, management came over and informed us the coleslaw was always made freshly everyday. I tasted the coleslaw and it was definitely off as it was really fizzy YUK! Really wanted to make the manager eat the lot to prove a point.I guess All Star Lanes is a fun alternative for a group night out but it's a bit too corporate for my liking.",

BUT the food is lovely, really quality burger cooked really well. We stuck to the beers last night but I've been in there before for a milkshake as well as it was excellent!

    "text": "Amongst the handful of restaurants in London that attempt to deliver an American-themed dining experience, All Star Lanes [Brick Lane] is the only one that has hit the nail on the head. From the atmosphere to the food, right down to the great service, I had a grin on my face the whole time as I actually felt like I was home. The menu is pretty impressive with a mixture of food from all 50 of the United States, not just burgers, fries and milkshakes. Quesadillas, Philly Cheese Steaks and Blackened Catfish are all amongst the array of typical American cuisine and they have an impressive selection of American beers including Blue Moon and for those who really miss that flavour of the Rockies \u00a0Coors Light. Once you're finished stuffing your face with enough food to feed a small country (I recommend sharing because you will never be able to finish the baked mac n cheese but you deserve a bite!) they have a fancy bowling alley and karaoke booths. It was a nice change to bowl at a place that was not filled with smoke and smelly shoes \u00a0and we continued with the cocktails as we bowled thanks to the full bar in the bowling alley. All Star Lanes makes for a great night out of dining, drinking, and bowling for a bit of a change to the normal wine and dine. I highly recommend the blackened catfish (with Louisiana hot sauce of course) and the heavenly banana split. Pace yourself though, because this is proper American dining. I only have one gripe \u00a0that they have a Florida State Seminoles flag hanging in the entrance and the Florida Gators memorabilia was no where to be found.",

    "text": "All Star Lanes on Brick Lane is a very unique place. Somewhere where you and a group of friends can bowl, enjoy some food, and sing some karaoke. 7 of my friends and I booked online for Saturday night for all three options. Online it said \"Deposit: \u00a3104\". However, NO WHERE did it say \"this does not include food, service charge, etc.\"We had a great time bowling, eating, and singing karaoke. When we were eating we thought it was odd that each person could order two courses (starter and a main or main and a dessert) with a cocktail for the \u00a3104 total. We asked two separate waiters multiple times if we would be charged extra for the food. They each said \"no you already paid there's no extra charge\". We thought this was way too good to be true...it was.After karaoke we went to get my credit card from the desk where they hold it and they handed us the bill and it was \u00a3350! (I am from the states and that converted to about $450). My friends and I were super confused since we were told multiple times by two waiters that there would be no extra charge. We relayed this to the ladies behind the counter and they said the waiters should have known and they told us the wrong information. We said this wasn't fair, especially since there is NOTHING online about it. One of the ladies behind the counter was nice and offered us a discount and took away the \u00a330 service charge, the other lady wasn't so nice. We ended up only paying \u00a325 extra per person. Although we had fun, this was definitely not worth paying \u00a3350 for. The food was only okay and the portions were tiny, the staff was unhelpful and some of them rude, although we did enjoy our night. We will not be returning though, not with those prices.",

Two friends I went with thought exactly the same. The burgers were over cooked, chewy and tasteless. I asked mine to be medium and I got this dry pate of minced beef instead. The sweet patato fries I order were nice...though it's not a rocket science to fry a potato. However the portion was quite small. Also the waitress had no idea if they have any ales. Actually when asked if they have any...she answered NO instead of saying that she didn't know. Surprise, surprise...I managed to even find a craft IPA after I looked in their beer menu.I definitely won't be visiting there anytime soon",

We arrive a few minutes early and it was easy enough to pay and change our shoes over. Our lane was ready and we gave them our names which meant we were all ready to go as soon as we got to our lane. A waitress came straight over to take our drinks order. Nice and easy right? Well we started however my goodness was there a lot of kids. I guess we should have expected it but it was just kids birthday city! It would have been OK but these kids kept running in to our lane, getting in our way and sitting on the bowling balls! I suppose we got unlucky with badly behaved children and incapable parents but gosh did it ruin our fun!Lesson learnt - don't come on a Sunday.To be honest though it wasn't just this. It is a fairly small place with no real atmosphere and if you finish your game in under 45 minutes that is it.. game over. Unlike Brooklyn Bowl where music is great, they have sports on some of the TV's and you get a set time and can keep playing until it runs out.I am not sure I will be back unless with a group on a week night - no kids guarenteed.",

The only reason I give four stars instead of five is because the wait staff screwed up our drinks order thrice. They were very courteous and apologetic about the whole thing. But it did piss off the people in our group a wee bit--especially those whose drinks didn't show up. All in all, a good experience and I'd definitely recommend this place.",

There's also pool tables and some other games I think, though we were there to bowl. We did have to wait a bit for our reserved lane though, I recommend calling ahead. The drink menu is fun and impressive and very sugary, but there's a full bar for whatever you might want. It was a bit dead in there on a weekend but we were there kind of early.

The little brother will never be quite as edgy or cool, but he'll end up more successful no doubt. The older brother I speak of is Bloomsbury Lanes, which lead London down the path to retro bowling and drinking.What you will get with All Star Lanes is a big, pristine space flooded with staff and well maintained bowling alleys. They'll pinch your pockets for the food and drink you go for, it really isn't cheap, but you know what you're getting every time you go.That being said, not sure I'm a fan of the apparent requirement to eat here after/before you bowl or take the financial penalty for not doing so. Doesn't really seem in keeping with the fun-time vibes they try to sell!Limited range of beer at the bar, it's pricey Blue Moon or Coors on tap - although they do have a decent range of bottled beers to get stuck into (see reference to getting your pockets pinched above though).Overall, fun to be had, and they're reliable and professional in what they do.

If you are meeting people here, for some reason it can be really hard to identify them.

Try the 'Zombie' cocktail - it's pretty lethal, and comes blazing. Like, actually on fire.I opted for the fried chicken basket and sweet potato fries, which was pretty good. The chicken was very tender and the spice was done right. Though not a place to go for an amazing culinary experience, it is good for a fun night out with friends.",

    "text": "Disco-bowling is sooooooo 2012! I swear it is so much fun, you should try....When I think of bowling, I usually think of middle-aged men in some sort of grubby bowling alley... Not the case at All Star Lanes!It's clean, it looks funky, excellent service and good food.The bowling is absolute fun; it starts with the shoes. Seriously, I reckon you can make these into fashion item one day. Right, so the shoes are on, it's time to get into serious bowling... you get a table & lane with your friends and off you go. I was totally rubbish, seriously, I was. But it was good fun and the cocktails made it all better. They have a good range of different cocktails, I tried the Dark 'n' Stormy... and stormy it was. Quickly switched to beer, I reckon that after 3 of these Dark 'n' Stormies, I'll be \u00a0throwing the bowling balls into the wrong direction.Afterwards, we went for dinner. I tried the baby ribs and the caesar salad. The ribs were very very very tender. The Caesar salad was very good, the kind of classic caesar that you expect, and then yesss, you also get served.Apparently, they also do karaoke... will definitely try that as well. I looooove this kind of entertaining evenings out with friends!",

    "text": "the mac 'n' cheese was bland bland bland. Should've ordered it with bacon! But I don't know why I didnt, or why they didn't offer?we also had the quesedillas and also the salt and pepper squid for starters. The squid was great, and it was packed in a makeshift takeaway cardboard box, like you do from a chinese takeaway. It was really cute. The quesedillas were solid. I'm just sad my main let the whole thing down.The cocktails are where it's at though. The Julep Jar is lovely. It wasn't too sweet but also quite refreshing! Didn't try the bowling but we did go underdog afterwards for more cocktails! Woop",

    "text": "I usually hate bowling. Especially bowling that tries to be more than it is. Light up lanes and a night club atmosphere does not make bowling anymore interesting. Please. Stop.BUT. I had an excellent Sunday afternoon at All Star Lanes. Yes it's a bowling alley with mood lighting and cool decor, but it neither takes itself too seriously or goes over the top with kitschy, experiential add-ons. The food is great, the atmosphere is relaxed and it is very reasonably priced - we paid \u00a36.95 each for a game and shoes. The front section is a large dining room and I would definitely go back and make a full evening of All Star Lanes.",

    "text": "On approach, the hustle and bustle disguise this 10 pin 10 star venue. You walk in the doors and are taken back by the ambient sounds of the American style diner. Classic 50's tracks compliment the modern take on a period design. The party I was wit had bowling booked, and the 10 minutes allocated to organise the groups classic Puma bowling footwear was substantial. What I personally found amazing was that by the time we arrived at our assigned lane(s) our names were already on the screens! After the Bowling which went without a hitch, we took our seats in a both awaiting to be seated at our table for food. Within the time the waitress approximated, we were sat down on a suitable table which had fresh, cool water awaiting to cleanse our mouths for the fantastic food that shortly followed. The grub was what you would expect from an American diner styled resturaunt, Burgers Ribs, Fries, a range of salads and then a Crab. All looked and tasted fantastic, there were no complaints among-st our group. Even paying was made simple, 10 people, 10 debit cards, two waitresses taking payments, it made everything nice and simple. Bowling \u00a38(ish) Meal \u00a315Would I go again? already have!!!",

    "text": "Who would've thought a humble pair of swinging doors would lead into such a cavernous bowling alley.All Star Lanes is a nod to glamor bowling. \u00a0For you big city Americans out there, think of it as Lucky Strikes meeting TGIF with Americana amped way up. Plenty of suits and skirts stop in on weeknights just to roll a few.A large dining area and lounge/bar tucked in the back makes this an ideal venue for office parties or get-togethers. Sadly the food menu isn't very inspiring in the way of variety or pricing: on last check a philly cheese steak went for 12 quids. Just 30 feet down Brick Lane one could easily find alternative burger and hot plate options.Blue Moon is allegedly on tap but only bottles were served the night of my visit. Can't complain. Let's hope they sign Fat Tire soon.",

The decor is finnnnneeeee!!We started off with bowling, their are six lanes which are short and sweet, which was good because it made me come second and it was the first time I did not use barriers.The price of a game is \u00a36.75 which is off-peak price, after 6pm its \u00a38:75.The bowling alley was slick and immaculate, and the lighting gave the bowling a beautiful ambiance. The birthday girl did book another session of bowling, but All Stars must of double booked or something it was all good because it worked in our favor.All stars have two karaoke, which can hold up to 7-14 people. Our rate was \u00a360 but split between ten people it was cheaper. They had a good song selection with all your karaoke favorites. The room gets hot as you can imagine ten people singing their hearts out and dancing like maniacs. They could of done with wayyyy y better air-con. I was pleasantly surprised, me being tall and all, i was doing a dance while standing on the seats and i did not touch the ceiling with my head. We were overrun the hour, but the staff allowed us more time with no extra cost, sweeeeeet!!The customer service was Awesome!! The staff were friendly and I liked their retro uniforms.I cant comment on the drinks and food, because I did not try anything, but the cocktails looked fly in the jam jars.If you reserve a bowling alley and you and your guest do not turn up on time you get charged, luckily we all came on time. Cant wait to come here again, I'm sure when I do it will get an extra star. :)",
