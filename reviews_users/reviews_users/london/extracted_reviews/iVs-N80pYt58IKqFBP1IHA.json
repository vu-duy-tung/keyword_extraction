    "text": "Is there some law against proper seasoning in England?It's unnerving. In all honesty, I probably respect cuisine in the UK a little more than the typical critic. From almost every casual gourmand I know, I've heard nothing but disdain for English cuisine, that it's essentially a symphony of bland. It's more or less true- most of the food I've had here have been lacking in taste and variety. That being said, while I don't respect tastelessness of the food here, I can respect their attention to texture. Their pastry and pie dough used in their dishes is excellently made, and their dishes are almost always appropriately crispy or soft. Which brings me to this travesty of a dish. I've tried the fish pie, fish and chips, and swordfish sandwich. All of them were excellent with regards to texture. The fish and chips were expertly fried, and the fish pie was smooth and melted in my mouth. Why oh why couldn't they be bothered to season the dishes appropriately? Have they never heard of lemon or garlic or salt or capers or paprika or any other of the myriad of seasoning options in existence today? I think that the air I breathed was more seasoned than the dishes at this place.",

My advice is not to eat it for dinner as it's heavy and not so healthy. Well, eat it once a week and you'll be fine. There are a few topings and sides to choose from but the real variety comes from all the seafood.",

That said, having sampled a couple of shared starters ( calamari and whitebait \u00a0both light battered, and not as greasy as can sometimes be the case), and enjoyed an impressive piece of skate wing as a main, I was reasonably impressed. Service was as prompt as our lowly British expectations dictate, and the restaurant filled up quite convncingly as the evening wore in.All that said, the observations of our American guests were quite interesting, since they came from New England, which obviously considers itself a seafood centre of excellence.

    "text": "Fish'n'chips! It's a British staple and as a theoretically born and bred Londoner it's something I get a craving for every now and then. I've used many avenues to keep this addiction of sorts going from the greasy chippy on the way home, to a full sit down meal at the Anchor, and even cooked it myself once or twice after an early morning trip to the fish markets. Feeling too lazy to do it myself, too healthy for a chippy, and being on my own, I decided to try the Fish! Stall at Borough Market. This is attached to the glass-walled restaurant and they seem to do a brisk business so I figured it was worth a shot. You start off on the right side to place your order, and a cod and chips will cost you close to a tenner. A bit more than the chippy but not unreasonable. The cod was cooked perfectly with moist flaky flesh, a crisp batter, and most surprisingly a distinct lack of oily aftertaste. \u00a0The piece of fish is massive too, roughly a foot long and 4 inches wide but I still demolished it in no time at all. I could have happily knocked out another one without batting an eye, it was that good. This chips were thick cut and tasty but soggy and lacking any crunch whatsoever. A bit of a fail and definitely a let down after that fish.The most annoying part is that they charge you for tartare sauce (something I believe is an essential component of fish and should be included for free) and then there was no tartar sauce in my order. If you are going to charge make damn sure you get it right.Overall, it was a spectacular piece of fish worthy of 4 stars but loses out due to poor chips and lack of quality service. 3 stars because I'm feeling happy today.",

We ordered our beers, a Peroni and London IPA, an appetizer of calmari which came with a rocket and lemon mayo and ordered our entrees of Haddock fish and chips with mushy peas each. Our beers came about thirty to forty minutes later, even after the appetizer and I'm not sure how I even lasted that long. I felt like I was on boiling points on MTV but I was patient enough to wait. Finally I had to call some people out and start cussing out loud a little calling out the horrible service and comparing it to how it would be to the states. The fish was great though and the meal was enjoyed but the service was horrible as even our server changed to another during the time for no reason. Never coming again.",

The restaurant itself is a bit posh, in keeping with the Borough setting of foodies and cashmere. However, the service is not a all snobbish and I would really recommend this place for a great laid-back meal. The waitress didn't even think twice about whether it was ok for me to have a slightly bigger starter for my main course and adapted the prices accordingly.Unfortunately, our experience here was slightly marred by the fact that my boyfriend and I were both recovering from bad colds. The heating in the restaurant seemed a bit obscene especially since I had an air vent blowing powerfully behind my feet. To this day I'm not able to tell if I was my own personal body temperature to blame or if other customers felt the same.Nonetheless, the food was great and service very efficient. Fish! isn't cheap but it's rare to find food this fresh that is. Well recommended!",

If you have planned ahead and you want to eat fish at Borough Market I would recommend Wrights Porter and Oyster bar which will give you wonderful food and a great experience at a similar price. I turned up at fish! this Saturday with six other chaps who had joined me on the stroll along the river from Richmond to our destination, Borough Market. After a pint at the Rake we felt the need for some fish and chips so, it being a Saturday night, fish! was our only realistic choice of getting a walk in table anywhere near Borough Market unless we fancied a curry. When we arrived the restaurant was almost empty so it was no problem being found a nice table despite being rigged out in our urban walking gear. Even with its conservatory type feel, the acres of glass and a kitchen fully open to the dining room this in not a restaurant I would call swanky or a destination type place. If you are looking for a special occasion venue, or somewhere for a romantic rendezvous, this would not be on any short list of mine. However, it's a pleasant enough space although it has no real soul and is a bit lacking in atmosphere. In the main I would say it is frequented by tourists, out of towners and locals who find themselves in Borough in need of some food to keep them going through the evening. Having said all that, and dammed with faint praise, it suited us boys well enough after an 18 mile walk. Cod, chips and mushy peas all round was the order of the day once we had managed to catch the eye of our underemployed but still quite charming waitress. After only a short wait, quite a bit of which seemed to be spent on the pass while the waiting staff got themselves together, our fish supper arrived and it was a pretty decent meal. The fish itself was a fresh, chunky fillet enclosed in a tasty batter, which if it had been left in the fryer just a moment longer would have been overdone. The chips only rated an ok, no problems but nothing to write home about and I even left a few. However, the mushy peas were damn fine and drew murmurs of admiration from the two Northern lads who were in our party; trust me I think these boys would know a good mushy pea when they tasted one. At \u00a315.95 for fish and chips this is bordering on the eye watering in terms of price but the quality and the location was good. We washed this down with a couple of bottles of the house white which was fine but pretty bog standard. The boys grudgingly saying that it was a decent fish supper and it should be at that price as we trudged through the Market for a nightcap at the Porter seemed to sum up the experience very well.",

I just can't get excited about British chips when French fries are just so much better. If you're going to eat junk food, might as well do it right. Some people complained about the tartar sauce. My fish soup was average. Friends calamari were fairly good and fresh. The restaurant is pretty inside. And if the weather is bad and you want to sit down vs. eat at the usual borough vendors, it was an ok choice. I thought the prices were 'London fair' \u00a9 for what could otherwise be a tourist trap. The servers where really polite and fast, although the market was dead while were there. The real service test would be on a Friday or Saturday.",

(which is a sitdown, and has longer hours), and it is right next to it in the middle of the Borough Market. \u00a0We got there maybe 15 minutes before they were closing on a Saturday night, and they were friendly enough, even though they were clearly trying to clean up to go home (or out for a drink, who knows). \u00a0The portions were huge, and even though I don't normally like cod much, this was delicious. \u00a0It had a crunchy crust even after dousing it in vinegar and walking back to the hotel, and the fish itself was flavorful without being overly fishy. \u00a0The chips were so good that I ate 2/3rds of them through the side of the container while we walked. \u00a0The only complaint I had, and this may be standard in the UK but was a surprise to me, was that you have to ask for tartar sauce and pay for it as an extra, rather than it being included in the price. \u00a0Not a big expense at 45 pence, but it'd be pretty disappointing to walk away without it because you forgot to specify!",

The cockles appetiser was fantastic and, because there were so many of us sharing it, they doubled up on the portion size with no extra charge! It was the first time my father had ever had cockles and he absolutely loved them. My mother got the seafood salad, which she liked but I wasn't a fan of. Three of us got fish and chips (one plaice, haddock, and halibut). I liked the plaice the best but I prefer lighter fish in general. My father is a halibut fan and loved his - I found it too meaty. My brother got a fish pie, which he was a bit nervous about because the fish/cheese combo is a bit odd to us but he loved it. Overall, the food was clearly freshly made - I enjoyed seeing the kitchen right in the middle of the restaurant and watching them prepare some of our food - and high quality. Definitely worth another visit.",

The first time I came here with a friend, we realised that there really isn't any need to buy two f&c boxes between two people- one is more than enough. In fact, had we each bought f&c box we agreed there was no way we'd have been able to finish it alone.My only complaint would be the apparent lack of outdoor seating- but given it's a take-away stand, that's understandable.All in all- great stand, and always a lovely excuse to go shopping at Borough Market (plus it's easy to get to- just outside the London Bridge tube exit and then next to the Green Market entrance!).",

You may have to wait just a bit while they fry your meal (FRESH!)Food: Ah yes, so of course, I had:- Cod and chips: the cod was really really amazingly flakey! I was pleasantly surprised. It was hot and freshly crispy and the batter was really right on. The chips were also nice and hot and I definitly didn't complain! Load up on your personal choices of ketchup, vinegar and salt :)- Risotto Balls: I LOVE RISOTTO BALLS! And they do a really good job of them. They didn't look like much but once I opened them- WOW!

Didn't realize it but it was too late and the market stall was closed so I ended up grabbing a table inside the restaurant, which didn't disappoint! Got there around 6:30 and the place was still pretty empty but it quickly filled up. I'd say grab a seat early and inside if you can.... it is under the London Bridge after all and traffic will get loud outside. I had the fried haddock with chips and mashed peas, a market punch and sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream. The fish was perfect not a lot of seasoning but a slight fresh yeast flavor to the batter. The chips are cooked three times apparently, first time boiled in water and that ensures they're not at all greasy but a nice crisp potato. The market punch was nice and refreshing as a cocktail and went very well with the meal. Lastly the pudding didn't disappoint, the only thing I would add is another scooping of ice cream! Although I got something simple there were a variety of seafood selections around the very packed tables.... If fish and chips are not your thing I'm sure they'll have something for you as well (but not steak ) Very good meal indeed!",

I got the cod fish and chips and it was bland as anything. The fish wasn't seasoned at all, and I had to douse it in ketchup, lemon, and malt vinegar to choke it down. Same with the fries. The tartar sauce that I had to pay extra to get was also unseasoned. Sure, the fish and chips had some crispiness, but there's no excuse for under-seasoned food, especially one of the most iconic dishes of Great Britain.",

I was only visiting London for about 4 days and felt I could have ate somewhere with better food/value, especially near the Borough Market. I LOVE the glass ceiling concept and whole style of this place but without that, I would rate it a 2 due to how dry my Swordfish was and it really lacked flavor. I got it with the herb butter, which you would think would make it more moist, it was so dry. So sad because swordfish is my favorite and this meal was kind of expensive. I also had the brushcetta which was good, at least I could taste the garlic so I was happy with that. Oh I had a Mimosa which was really good and my boyfriend had a latte which was delicious, so there's that too. I would probably come back if I lived in London, but unfortunately, I live in the US so I probably won't be able to give this place a second chance.",

Came in here with a huge group of bloggers for an event so we had a set menu to choose from- I went with the prawn cocktail, the swordfish steak and vegetables and the bread and butter pudding for dessert. The prawn cocktail was huge and super filling so could barely eat my swordfish but it was cooked just right-medium rare and tender. I usually love bread and butter pudding but the custard had a film on it and was a bit cold. Would have preferred it nice and hot with ice cream. White wine was really nice. All in all enjoyable, it's a big place with plenty of tables or you can dine at the bar.",

    "text": "Perhaps 3.5 stars.I love fish and chips restaurants that serve more than just the classic battered and fried cod with chips. This is certainly one of them.We went on a Sunday evening around 8 pm. The place is quite huge, actually, with both indoor and outdoor seating. There were no tables filled outdoors, but inside there were a few. Most of the place was empty, though, so no reservation was necessary at that time.We were given our choice of table and our serve was very nice and pleasant. She answered all questions and offered suggestions.We ordered 1 classic beer-battered cod fish and chips, which were also served with mushy peas. The peas had quite an earthy taste, but the fish was great and the chips were good, but nothing to write home about.For our second dish, we ordered off the a la carte creation menu in which you choose one of about 10 different types of fresh fish and can request it either grilled or steamed. After some debate, we ended up trying the plaice and requested that it be steamed. The plaice is a very soft, flaky white fish. This was served with skin and had a very unpleasant taste. I will be fair and say I don't think it's the restaurant's fault, but plaice is not really the fish to choose, I think. We should have gone with the classic cod if we wanted a flaky fish or probably the swordfish if we wanted something steakier. Anyway, these grilled/steamed fishes are served with a vegetable garnish (fennel, carrot, cabbage), but we requested chips in lieu of the vegetables and they kindly obliged.We also ordered a tomato and onion salad with dressing on the side. When we received it, it had been dressed. When we informed them of the mistake, they immediately replaced it and apologized.The restaurant is quite expensive, but I appreciate the plentiful choices and good service. Also, it's very open and airy, which is nice. I'd recommend it, but I am not dying to go back.",

There was a nice crisp on the outside of the fish and tender meat inside. I wish the chips were a little crispier but that's okay. Fish & Chips and a Peroni. I was a satisfied man at the end of the meal. You can chose to either sit in the restaurant or grab a quick bite at the takeout stall outside.

I originally wanted the oysters but they were out.The fried calamari however was excellent. Definitely worth ordering. Get this!Main course was fish and chips which was market price cod. It was nice but truthfully i noticed no difference from ordinary cod. Home made tarter sauce was nice and chips were cooked well. Don't bother upgrading the cod though. I wish it would have had some batter as no real crunch or texture. My friend had a bacon wrapped fish entree with pumpkin. It was good and I would get this instead.All in all this place is nice enough but I think if I went back I would order differently outside of the calamari. \u00a0For what it cost (around \u00a355 with bottled water and no wine) I think it was ok but it just didn't blow me away.",

The food came out at a decent time and it was served piping hot with a nice crunchy outside texture and soft juicy inside. We came after the market was closed so there was no line. They do have a seating area, but it was all filled. The fish and chips came in a box so we were able to just take it and fine a curb to sit on. The condiments and such are located on the large table where people were eating, so it was a bit awkward to interfere with their space for ketchup.... I think these items should be put on a tall table so that people don't need to get into each other's face... i found the price to be fair for the amount of food we got. We only shared one and it was doable... if you aren't starving. I wouldn't call the service friendly but they aren't rude, just very quick. It seems like if you become a regular they'll treat you like family.... if you plan to come just be prepared to find seating elsewhere.... or go into the restaurants right next door. I'll definitely be coming again.",

    "text": "I visited the restaurant's takeaway fish and chips shop that's located right next door. I smelled the delicious, greasy goodness and had to get an order to share. There will most likely be a long line but locals told me that you can phone ahead and they'll have your order waiting for you so you can avoid the line. The portion size was large and plenty for two adults to share as a small snack. Several varieties of flavored ketchup and malt vinegar are provided free of charge; you'll have to pony up a little extra cash if you want mayonnaise or tartar sauce. There are different varieties of white fish (Cod, Haddock, Halibut) and what you get depends upon what's on offer that particular day. They say they serve fresh fish purchased from the market that day so availability is dependent upon what's the fresh catch of the day. The halibut will cost a few pounds more than the other fish varieties. I honestly can't remember what type of fish we were served but I do know that it was hot, fresh, and flaky. The beer batter wasn't greasy at all and had a lovely crunch to it. The chips were even better (but who doesn't love fried potatoes)? Note that there is very limited seating as this takeaway stand is in the bustling Borough Market. If you are lucky enough to get a stool take it immediately! Open 7 days a week and late on Friday and Saturday nights!",

As for the best fish and chips in London, which I heard they got for 2017? I don't think so...The crust was super hard and the portion was small. Peas and chips were just OK. Maybe I just was unlucky. These things can happen depending on who is cooking, etc. Our Spanish waiter was friendly and funny, but so dingy. He couldn't get our orders straight... I think he was still dreaming about his weekend trip to Spain, which he kept talking about. Haha, though. He was entertaining....and a sweet guy. Finished off with a toffee pudding, which was very nice. In all, loved our night there but mostly because I got to see my cousin. We hadn't seen each other since 1983!",

Well, everyone else had the same idea, and places were quickly filling. Since we traveled with a large group, not too many places were accommodating. That is until, we came upon this place. They had a large outdoor seating area, and we were able to fit our group over three large table settings. We ordered some drinks, which were pretty damn good, and some apps with desserts. The calamari was beautiful crisp and just perfect. The dessert, which was a warm bread pudding, was incredible!!! Seriously delicious and perfect, with enough cinnamon and raisin to savor the flavor. My first time ever having this type of dessert. The Bloody Mary were good, as well.Our waitress, cute as a button, was having a hard time, though, with handling the orders and remembering who had what. I even caught her rolling her eyes a few times when patrons were standing in her way, when asked if we could pay our bills, and she had no idea who ordered what, and how much. She actually said this, \"Please write down what you ordered and then I'll tally up your bill. She pretty much had no record of ANYONE'S orders. I totally get it, though... it's a busy night, lots of people, maybe she wasn't feeling well or maybe she just didn't like us Seahawk fans, who knows... but to be rolling your eyes, making faces... you have to know body language sometimes speaks more than words... and her body talk that night was that she was irritated, tired, or just plain out didn't care to be there, who really knows. Either way, it was good food, great times visiting with friends, and our overall experience was pleasant... it could just do without the attitude. That's why I'm not giving this place a higher star rating. As always, enjoy and Happy Eating!",

I'm not so much of a fish eater, but prior to my visit I did find a tastier fish and chips in Notting Hill. Since Fish! Is labeled as \"The proud winner of the National Fish & Chips Award\" I felt I could be in a roll to find another good place. I went for the \"Cod & Chips\" (9.95). I did like how they serve a thicker piece of the fried cod. But the downside its mildly battered so the outside is not as crispy. There was a few bones within the meat, which it doesn't bother too much though. I believe their dipping sauce is their specialty, I didn't like it so much because It tasted like a combination of tartar sauce and coleslaw. I added some of the Sarson's malt vinegar for flavor, however it didn't help so much of it already being just an average fish. The portions of the chips was decent and they were good enough to be as a filler. We ordered a side of the \"Mushy Peas\" (2.25). It was the first time trying it this way. It's simple, creamy and lightly seasoned, it wasn't too bad. Overall, the experience was okay. I got excited at first but it lacked a little in tastiness. I do like their creativity in their tartar sauce, its different but it wasn't for me. Fish! Is a cool and casual food stand. Solid 3 stars.",

Both items were pretty bland. The mashed peas which came as a side to my brother's food was probably the best part of the meal. The one thing that stood out about this experience was the very poor service. Our waiter did not take the time to meet our needs. At one point I told him the meal was not what I expected and he told me to give it a shot. The ambiance was actually pretty nice and is the primary reason I would give any rating. I would also advise diners to beware of the price. Our order was about 70 pounds for an unremarkable meal we could have gotten at a pub.",

The price is reasonable for what you get and they're very nice. You will have to walk a while to find a seat though.

I chose to have the whitebait which was excellent. Fresh fish, lightly coated in breadcrumbs with an aioli dip. Not greasy at all. This was followed by fillet of sole which was pan fried with some sprouts and minced parsley I seem to remember sprinkled on top. This came with sea asparagus, a nice surprise. It was also surprisingly salty and made up for the lack of salt on the fish. My husband order a la carte starting with smoked salmon which also was excellent. However his fish(cod) and chips was a real study in contrast for while the chips were excellent - nicely crisp and not oily - the fish was simply inedible. It was powdery. The batter was good enough if somewhat oily. We complained and the restaurant took it off the bill. Overall the mains were quite oily (my sole was verging on being swimming in oil) and there were hits and misses. Not consistent. Would I recommend this place. Yes but be prepared to experience hits and misses. Staff and service was excellent.",

This one lacks after dark. The fresh offerings are checked off on the menu for your information and available steamed or grilled. They were out of monkfish (one of my favorite) and John Dory so I shoes the skate. But first, the fish! Soup. Wow. Light and refreshing. \u00a0Would have been great served in a cup to take away and drink while shopping the market. Worth stopping in just for fish! soup. The steamed Skate with spicy salsa was nice. Cooked well and easy off the bones. Very enjoyable. While I did not go with fish! and chips, offered as haddock cod or halibut, it looked great and was very large on the plate not the newspaper. Many parties around me chose that direction and cleaned their plates.The short, it !fish is a great place to pop in for lunch when near the market. I would not think of it as a dinner destination.",

You can see the chefs at work, and when I went years back they used to yell out \"fish!\" very loudly as soon a dish was prepared, but unfortunately I don't think this happens now. The Thai Crab Cakes with Sweet Chilli Sauce is oh so good, and actually relatively filling. But you do want to follow suit with one of their fish steaks from their lengthly fish option. The Organic Salmon is grilled just so that the meat breaks off well, and not the least bit dry ( which can easily happen when over cooked). Next door, if you don't fancy eating in the restaurant, you can order a portion of fish and chops which is definitely substantial the \u00a36 or \u00a37 that it's worth.",
