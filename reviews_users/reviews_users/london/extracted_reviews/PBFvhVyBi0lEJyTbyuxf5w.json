The tour was just \"meh\" but the staff at the Orangery made us feel like royalty. We arrived a bit early since we didn't realize that tea doesnt begin until 2:00pm but our waiter allowed us to wait until two instead of ordering a lunch we didn't want. The tea was delicious as were the delectables that were served alongside the tea. Simply lovely afternoon!",

The decor is lovely, sunlight streams through the tall windows and the view of the lush green gardens is delightful. \u00a0There are no reservations necessary. However at peak times, you can expect to wait 10-15 minutes to get seated.Prices are remarkably low. For \u00a315, you get finger sandwiches, scone with butter and jam, and pastries. You also get you selection of tea, of which I highly recommend their Orange tea called Roobio (I think). We even shared a slice of the Orangery cake, which was is unique to Orangery and delightful to our taste buds.So why do I give it just 4 stars? Well, the service was average. For example, we asked for no ham in our sandwiches, so instead of asking us which \u00a0sandwich we wanted to replace it with, the waitress brought us more salmon dill sandwiches, when we would have preferred cucumber sandwiches.The toilets are outside to the back of the building and while clean, are inconvenient. Other than that, a great experience. For the price, there is none better.",

    "text": "Fancy. Pants. But sometimes you need to put on a pair of pants that are fancy. And when you put them on, you should go to the Orangery at Kensington Palace. While it is a regular restaurant with a full menu, you really just need to go have afternoon tea. The ladyfriend and I opted for the Champagne Tea. We each received a pot of tea (the Ceylon was above reproach), four finger sandwiches, a scone with jam and clotted cream, two torts and a flute of champagne. The sandwiches are where the Orangery loses its star - my companion and I are both vegetarian, and one of the sandwiches was ham, and we could not substitute it for one of the other options. Apart from that, everything was perfect. The service was just a tad slow, but friendly, professional and worthy of no real complaints. The food was all to die for, and really, isn't good food why we are all here?When it comes to places like The Orangery, one is paying for the atmosphere. Personally, I think that this establishment is one of the more beautiful places that I have ever eaten - ornate and lovely, but not overdone or pretentious. The bright and airy hall, with a lovely view of the lawn and gardens, make for a wonderfully pleasing afternoon treat. The fact that the Champagne Tea was \u00a321 per person, plus automatic service charge means that I will not be going back as often as I would like, but I do plan on going back as much as my grad-student budget will allow.",

I was really excited to finally get the real deal (I've had afternoon tea at a British tea room in the US) and this place didn't let me down. There was a line to get seated, but the service wasn't bad considering how many tables they were serving inside and outside on the patio. The interior was nice; spacious, high ceilings, statues at both ends of the building...it was beautiful with the sun shining through the high windows.I ordered the Signature Orange Tea, which came with an assortment of finger sandwiches, a scone, chocolate eclair, and an orange and passion fruit tart; I decided to go with the recommended rooibos breakfast tea.Our teas came out first; mine was a loose leaf tea, so I was given a strainer (I've never had loose leaf tea before...). The rooibos breakfast tea smelled amazing and tasted amazing. I didn't put any sugar or cream in it because the flavor was enough for me. I wish I could have bought some of the tea to take home!The finger sandwiches were fresh and delicious. I really enjoyed the scone with clotted cream and jam; it had a hint of orange flavor to it too. The fruit tart was unlike anything I've tasted before; it wasn't too sweet and it was a perfect blend of flavors. The chocolate \u00e9clair wasn't too great, but that was only one item out of the entire selection. I was rather full after eating the sandwiches and scone, but managed to finish off the tart because it was so good. All of this for ~16 pounds (including service charge); this was the best 16 pounds I've spent on food and drinks! If I get a chance, I'd like to come back again.",

We came up to the entrance and was blown away at how bright and warm it looked inside. Beautiful venue.We stood and waited to be seated. One server looks at us, looks away. Another server looks at us, looks away. Another server looks at us, looks away. Finally someone felt sorry for us and seated us.We ordered an afternoon tea that came with chocolate cakes. I substituted my tea with a coffee. When the drinks finally came my coffee was lukewarm. So disappointed. That dampened my mood even more. Not even the delicious orange scone cheered me up. Nothing makes me more upset than being ignored by servers and getting a lukewarm coffee and for both to happen at the same place made for a very sad Mela.When we got our bill we were given a comment card to fill out. You better believe I filled it out and personally handed it to the manager upon exiting. Don't keep me waiting *and* mess with my coffee.",

The table and dishware were very well presented.

The cost is only \u00a313.65 per person compared to two or three times as much for afternoon tea at hotels. It's not a typical tea service in that you get a tiered dessert tray. The spread of savory snacks and petit fours is set up on a table in the middle of the cafe (yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026). Sometimes that setup is better because if you like one or two treats a lot, it's basically AYCE. The space is elegant and relaxing (yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026).

Second, when we got there, even though we made a reservation, nothing seemed to be set up for us. When the tea pots and cups came out, some of then were dirty so we had to ask them to replace our set. The sandwiches were bland and the cakes were tiny and average-tasting. Best part was the scones, but I think I liked the ones at Bea's if Bloomsbury better. Bea's was cheaper, too; Orangery came out to be 32 pounds per person which is almost 50 dollars...I really didn't feel like it was worth that kind of money.",

This was my second time since early 2008 - end of May 2011, and NOTHING has changed. Hey, if it ain't broke. The sandwiches are bland and cold, the desserts - a chocolate torte thing which was kind of dry, and a rather tasty peach tart - could use some improvement. The standout was the scone with raisins - so satisfying and moist and dense at the same time, with lovely clotted cream and fruit preserves (which may come from a jar), but I'm not complaining. I had the chocolate tea which was exceptional - a light and pleasant tea with notes of cocoa. Yum. I was intrigued to see how they would pull off chocolate tea, and they nailed it. My one regret - I didn't get the raspberry meringue - they looked like miniature clouds you'd eat in heaven.The decor is light and bright, looks like a Greek palace, and the staff is as bland as the sandwiches. But you're there for the experience, and it was certainly a good one.",

The tea was great, but I am a huge tea drinker so I recommend the lemon and ginger tea, it suits my pallet. The mini sandwiches were good too! My husband fell in love with the biscuits",

    "text": "Situated right next to Kensington Palace, The Orangery is an ideal location for the full British experience of afternoon tea without breaking your wallet. Although it is definitely less traditional, the setting is beautiful and complements the porcelain silverware and tea settings. The basic afternoon tea is 24 pounds per person, and you get a filling amount of sandwiches, scones, and desserts. It includes an array of sandwiches, from cucumber mint to smoked salmon and cream cheese. These were average in my opinion, but it was a good break from the sweeter options on the stand. The scones, both the plain and the orange raisin, were buttery and soft, but I would have liked it better if they were served warmer! The selection of desserts was amazing, from fruit tarts to marzipan cake to chocolate raspberry cake. The size of each was just small enough to make you feel only slightly guilty if you wanted to sample and finish them all! The assortment of teas was also great, but make sure you indicate to the waiter if you want to substitute the type of tea included in your set, otherwise they will serve a default English tea. I tried the wild berry infused tea, which was very fragrant and naturally sweetened with both apples and berries. Regardless, any tea you choose will be served in a beautiful pot and provide the perfect counterbalance to the sweet treats. Afternoon tea is a necessity when visiting London, but The Orangery is a great place to get the best bang for your buck. Other teas can get extremely expensive, so if you're looking for just a basic experience with delicious food, then this is the place to go!",

    "text": "A review for afternoon tea...One of my dearest, and most longstanding friends came for a visit to London -- and being that her name is Aynsley (English china, I believe) and that she enjoys the finer things in life (as do I), I saw it fitting to find a place for us to enjoy a traditional afternoon tea. My first ever in London as well! Wanting to avoid the hotel scene, and also to include some sightseeing --- The Orangery was the perfect locale, situated pristinely on the grounds of Kensington Palace, near Hyde Park and the beautiful Kensington Gardens. Of course, it was raining so there was no patio perching for our pair, but we were delighted in the experience nonetheless. We had a 1:30pm reservation (the latest I could get) -- without realizing that afternoon tea service does not start until 2pm. Consequently, there was a que at 1:50pm, that snaked around the front of the building. We found ourselves rather lucky to be enjoying a crisp glass of champagne whilst awaiting the 2 o'clock hour to begin tea. I believe this to be a lucky circumstance with a nice waiter, and also the promise that we would be ordering the most expensive tea service on the menu (32/pp). Quite pricey, and worth his service and patience and table...though I'm not sure if this would work again, I might try it anyway. Protip: splurge on the nice champagne with the highest tea service. One only lives once and how often do you take out of towners for tea? Not often. If you are here, you are likely either visiting or with someone visiting, so make it special. That glass is worth it. The actual tea itself was quite nice, with the three-tiered offering of finger sandwiches, pastries, jams, scones, clotted creams and petit cookies. We were offered refreshes on our teas often and without hesitation. We were encouraged to linger, despite the que -- but wrapped up our affair by 3pm and were on our way...stopping at the gardens for a quick peek around, gawking at the palace at bit, and then making our way for a walk in Hyde Park. Add it to your \"tourist\" list -- and enjoy that champagne. *There is also a back room to host private parties. On this particular day it was a child's birthday party. Fancy! *The toilets are around the side of the building, you'll need a code from the staff to enter.",

Hello, antiquated midday tradition! I liked the idea of coming to The Orangery because the walk through perfectly manicured Kensington Park is gorgeous and provided several impromptu photo shoot opportunities. Anyways, I made a reservation the day before, so we were seated as soon as we arrived. Our hostess was pleasant and helped us sort through the variety of teas. We each ended up ordering a pot of the lady grey and it was easily the best tea I've ever had (and this is coming from someone from a long line of serious tea drinkers!). I also enjoyed the scones, chocolate, and other desserts. I can't say that I was a huge fan of finger sandwiches, but my distaste has more to do with personal preference than food quality. Besides the food and tea, the aesthetic of the building and presentation is exquisite. The building features a classic white, elegant decor and grand lofted ceilings. The china pattern on the teacups and saucers is gilded with splashes of turquoise and a rosy floral print. This setting creates a beautiful backdrop for a lovely spot of tea. I would highly recommend this to any tourist, or a Londoner who just feels like being fancy.",

This was perfect, set in the Kensington Palace ground the building with its high ceiling and tall windows gave the room a sense of grandeur. We had the Royal High tea with Pimms cocktail. The savoury plate of wraps and sandwiches was delicious, loved the mint in the cucumber sandwiches. Had the BEST SCONES with yummy strawberry jam and cream. Only negative was the last plate of cakes and pastries tray was a bit dry and they brought the hot drinks when we still had 3/4 of our cocktail left so they went cold. My mum really enjoyed that you could substitute the tea with a hot chocolate. She also loved the little happy birthday plate :). Defiantly will bring all my friends and family when they come to visit.",

    "text": "Holy crap, I'm in London and having tea in the gardens of an English Palace. CHECK! Please excuse my overly excited American self as I am just so excited by this place!First off, the location is GREAT. It's in the garden, converted greenhouse of Kensington Palace with a gorgeous ambiance and view of the grounds. Now I can say I've had tea where Queen Anne used to. This place comes with fancy table linens, palace place settings (costs a pretty penny, trust me I know), and waitstaff in their full livery. Add in the garden statues, plants, and all white decor, you feel downright fancy in this place. If I didn't think I would insult any Brits I would've tried to speak with a posh accent the entire time I was there...Now the the important part. Food and Drink. I may have been distracted by the gorgeous, fancy settings, but I thought the tea and food was great! To me a lot of afternoon teas (especially in the states) are too sweet, creamy, salty, and heavy. Afternoon tea in my mind is supposed to be a light and airy snacktime between lunch and late dinner. The boyfriend and I got the Afternoon Tea set that included Egg mayonnaise and cress bridge roll (soft, light and perfect), smoked salmon and cream cheese mini bagel (perfectly creamy), Coronation chicken wrap (DELISH!), cucumber and fresh mint sandwich (refreshing) and Orange-scented and currant scones served with Cornish clotted cream, English strawberry jam (TO DIE FOR!!!!!) and an assortment of tea pastries. I've unfortunately forgotten what the tea pastries were because I was kind of in a happy daze. Either way, the boyfriend and I were quite happy with our food. And he's pretty picky since he doesn't love tea and is weirded out by a supposedly \"female\" activity. They had a wide variety of teas and I ended up with the Palace's version of the Lady Grey tea: Earl Grey Blue Flowers.Pricing wise, I have paid way more and felt less fancy in places like the Ritz, where yes I got more food. But I don't go to tea to be over fed and over sugared. This, in my mind, is the iconic, classic image of royal afternoon tea that I have read about in books.Overall, I could not find a single thing wrong with the place.",

    "text": "After the wife and I left the Orangery, we realized that the novelty of the place isn't so much the afternoon tea or the service, but the setting. On a summer day, we were sure that the Orangery would be a brilliant place to have tea.But since it wasn't, the food and the service had to carry the day. And it didn't really. The tea was fine, but the scones were only so-so, the sweets and pastries tasted like leftovers, the finger sandwiches (except for the salmon) were bland. The service was also a bit lacking- everyone seemed like they were counting down until the end of their shift, except for one waiter who was cheery and very competent. Gents, if you want to impress your (American) girlfriends, keep an eye on the weather before you come here. If the sun is shining, you'll have a great time. Otherwise, I would pass on the Orangery.",

    "text": "Dear Orangery, your tea service is spectacular. I will be back. Sincerely, Natalie.Ok, I do want to write more than that, but seriously if you're looking for a place to have a nice tea, LOOK NO FURTHER! I've had the tea service at Harrod's and while that was a great experience, I have to say I liked tea at the Orangery even better. I went with a group of colleagues while on a business trip to London. We made a reservation, which I would highly recommend. They may be able to fit you in as a walk-in with a small party, but reservations help. I was impressed by the selection of tea and tisane on their menu. I generally cannot do caffeine, and usually resign myself to a decaf earl grey that most places have. The orangery had several herbal choices (completely caffeine free). Each person receives their own pot of tea, which catered to my selfish American ways ;)We had the traditional afternoon service, and for each pair at the table we received a platter of goodies. Raisin scones with jam and clotted cream were probably my favorite. This was my first experience with clotted cream, and and must say the English have a winner on their hands! It's a delicious spread that is basically thick, slightly sweetened cream. I could feel it going straight to my thighs...and I loved it. Several little cakes and pastries I couldn't quite identify, but all were delicious. The cucumber sandwiches were a refreshing choice on a warm afternoon, and though I loved the sweets, provided a nice contrast.The place settings were lovely. Bright aqua and pink colors. There is a story about the orangery's history on the back of the menu, which is informative and interesting. Something neat to read while waiting for the rest of your party to arrive. The location is very idyllic. You must walk through Hyde Park to get there, and have the opportunity to pass Kensington Palace as well. There is a pond nearby, and as you walk up to the Orangery take note of the elegantly pruned trees and lush greenery. A few minutes here, and you begin to feel like royalty yourself!",

Location 5/5Ambiance 5/5Service 4/5Food 4/5 (5/5 for tea and sandwiches, 3/5 for scones, 2/5 for dessert)It's a less expensive tea than you'd get in other places in there city, but it's a bit pricey to what I've paid in other cities. I would have been happier to pay the 30 pounds (roughly $55) if it had been all outstanding, but only certain parts of the actual food were primo in my book. The tea itself: perfection. You get your own little pot and out renders around 4 cups, which is standard. The sandwiches were fantastic and easily the best part of the meal other than the tea itself. The scones (one plain and one raisin) were okay, the jam and clotted cream were also okay. The dessert, what I was looking forward to most, was not good. I didn't eat two out of the four mini deserts. They lacked flavor for my palate, but maybe it's just me. The food was all very pretty. Would I do it again? Yeah, I would. It's a pretty place. I might order lunch instead of high tea next time.",

There were a number of families and tourists, but they did not at all take away from the experience. The tables are simply but beautifully decorated, and our server was welcoming and attentive. Three of us had the English Afternoon Tea, and the other two had the pork belly and seared tuna.The Lady Grey was delicious (a floral Earl Grey), although the sandwiches and desserts were just good (not fantastic, but not bad either). The pork belly was again okay, but the seared tuna was disappointing. In general, I expect tuna to be seared rare, but this one was cooked through and on the dry side.Nevertheless, we really enjoyed our lunch at the Orangery. From the classy environment to the wonderful service, I would definitely recommend afternoon tea at the Orangery.ATMOSPHERE: 5/5SERVICE: 5/5FOOD: 3.5/5VALUE: 3.5/5OVERALL: 4/5",

Here is how The Orangery advertises their gluten free menu online: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Afternoon Tea with no gluten-containing  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ingredients \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Assorted sandwiches, sconey bun, almond moon  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cake, shortbread and brownie \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a327.50 per personI don't know what The Orangery's regular afternoon tea menu is like, as I dined alone, but THE GLUTEN FREE AFTERNOON TEA WAS BEYOND TERRIBLE.-No \"sconey bun\" or anything to replace it-No fruit preserves (probably because there were no scones)-No \"assorted sandwiches\". I was served six wraps instead. (The kind you can buy at Tescos for \u00a34 - not exaggerating). There were three kinds of wraps. I was served two of each. They weren't bad but I wouldn't describe them as good either. They were edible. One was black Forrest ham - it was okay. Another was vegetarian - not very tasty. And I'm not sure what the third was. I wouldn't buy these from a convenience market for \u00a34 unless I was hungry, had already shopped multiple locations and had given up on quality or taste. -No \"almond moon cake, shortbread and brownie\", instead I was served a fudge-orange bar (was this the brownie?) and an oatmeal-cranberry bar with cream. (The cream was very good but couldn't fix the desserts, neither of which were any good). I ate one bite of the fudge one, didn't enjoy it much but took a second small bite to decipher the orange part of the taste but I didn't eat anymore of it. The oatmeal one was okay but the whole experience was so underwhelming, I was not in the mood to continue it. I verified with my server that this was all I was to expect of the meal, asked for my tab, paid and left. The Royal Tea Blend was excellent but that's hard to botch.If you eat gluten, this place is probably pretty good or it wouldn't have such great reviews but if you are gluten free, as I am, I don't recommend eating here. I am rating The Orangery One Star because the service was prompt. I apologize for not including any pictures. I didn't even think about Yelping when I received my meal. I was so disappointed upon my food's arrival, I didn't want to remember it and I definitely wasn't going to send home pictures. I was embarrassed that I was spending so much for so little. I should have just paid for my Lemonade and walked out.",

All of the staff was friendly and courteous EXCEPT for our waiter. Older man with buzz-cut graying hair. Took our order and never came back ONCE. \u00a0He even avoided making eye contact when he walked by. Our plates and glasses sat empty on the table for 20 minutes or more. He seemed to have a chip on his shoulder--maybe he dislikes gay guys or Americans. I say this because he had no trouble attending to all of his other tables. \u00a0We had to ask another waiter for drink refills and the check.",

The space is bright, airy, and soft with beautiful views of Kensington and the gardens. The Pimm's cocktail we had was delicious and refreshing. The tea, Darjeeling, was superb with the great milk and sugar cubes provided; and all in those cute cups! The food was excellent; you could honestly skip lunch and just wait for this. The sandwiches were great; my favorite was the mini bagel with salmon and cream cheese. The Orange and current scones were DIVINE! All with the clotted cream and jam. And the cakes and dessert puddings were just delightful. Of course, this is a pricier experience, \u00a0but compared to most other places High Tea this is very reasonable. Keep in mind, this is an experience as much as it is a meal. High Tea is more formal, but the Orangery is pretty casual; understanding many people there are travelers with limited clothing options.The service staff is very friendly and made us feel comfortable. I spent 2 hours just sitting and chatting and enjoying. I will be back!",

The scones/cakes/cream/jam are supermarket quality and tea is served very cheaply (they leave the leaves in the pot instead of strainer which makes it become bitter very quickly).The location of the place is great but it's cheaply decorated. Despite all of this horrendous service, they charge 27 pounds per person (including service charge). For this price you can get a much better service in any of the tea rooms in one of the downtown hotels.(The high end price is around 75 pounds per person and the lower end price is 6).",

It's certainly picturesque with pretty views of gardens and the park and the weather while we were there in April was perfect. We arrived just before closing and the line wasn't too long. We grabbed an open table on the patio and watched many people walk away disappointed shortly afterwards as the place was closing for the evening. We had Earl Gray and Jasmine tea and split a scone which was delish. It was quite relaxing and perfect to fill our tummies with snacks before continuing forward to Notting Hill. The bathrooms were indeed around the building with an entrance from the outdoors. It definitely felt more like a tourist destination. Good tea introduction, not too expensive, but if I did it again, I think I might go all out to a hotel for a more luxurious experience.",

The clotted cream also had an off consistency and were quite salty. My friend said that it wasn't even clotted cream but butter. Major disappointment because those are such big components of afternoon tea. The cakes and other treats looked pretty but tasted bland.However, service was overall polite, accomodating, and helpful. They let me sit at a table and wait for the rest of my party (I ended up waiting for over an hour). The waiters were still attentive (a couple checked up on me), but I never felt pressured.My flat mates and I really wanted to like this place, but we all felt that Harrods afternoon tea was the best! Maybe we were just spoiled from the all-you-can-eat, but their afternoon tea is amazing.Pros: The chocolate-orange tea was unique and delightful to try.Nice location at the center of Kensington Gardens.Overall pleasant vibe and service.Cons:The \"clotted cream\" (too salty/buttery) and scones (too soft/soggy).Bland desserts.The price/portion ratio -- lacking a bit for what you pay for.",

    "text": "After my visit to Kensington Palace, I walked towards The Orangery for afternoon tea. The exterior of the Orangery which was built in the year 1705 looked almost as huge as Kensington Palace! It looked very upscale and there was a large green grass covered that was perfectly cut; good enough for a PGA golf match for sure. There are many benches towards the entrance too, so the exterior environment is very park like. Once I entered The Orangery, I realized that this place has an upscale environment which looked better than the interior inside Kensington Palace - what a shame eh? On another note, The Orangery was built by Queen Anne, so you are dining at a Royal establishmentI decided to order spicy cinnamon tea. Not too daring, but more interesting than earl grey black tea. The tea was served with an individual tea pot. Honestly, it looked like something one would use to water plants. \u00a0I'll say there was about about a quarter of a litre of tea, and it came with a small container of milk for the group. I could really taste the cinnamon and it was rich, warm, and a tad spicy, even with the added milk. The first item to eat were raisin scones with cream and raspberry jam. \u00a0The scones were soft and buttery, and with the added cream and jam, it tasted quite heavenly. The second item were the sandwiches. There were a variety that were cut into little finger size portions: cucumber, cream cheese and chive on poppy seed bread; poache salmon and dill on onion bread; and slice ham with grain mustard mayo on sun blushed tomato bread. They were garnished with something which looked like clovers. Honestly, the sandwiches were nothing amazing, but the bread was very soft and it was nice to eat something that wasn't sweet. I should mention that the breads on the various sandwiches tasted like plain white bread, which was rather disappointing. The last item was their signature orangery cake. It's a yellowish cake with yellowish icing with orange shavings inside. It tasted lemonish and orangey. Nice, but not extraodinary. Service was a bit of a miss. The waitress acted like she was in a hurry and she ended up dropping some of the utensils on the floor. Service was quite rushed, and maybe I'm too harsh for something who just travelled in Paris? I mean, they literally took 5 seconds to hand out tea, milk \u00a0for four people in my table. \u00a0Total price of the bill? \u00a350.12 which was pricey, but it was a memorable experience, thanks to the bright classy interior. \u00a0I'll honestly have to say that I enjoyed the tea more than the food. After the meal, I had to use the washroom. Interestingly, the unisex washroom is only accesible by leaving the front entrance. It's located near the side of the building. You will need a numeric password to enter it - they're not for the public! Inside, each of the huge toilet stalls has its own sink, soap dispenser, and towels. Strange, but it works!",

    "text": "Afternoon tea at the Orangery is a lovely (and affordable: \u00a326.00) weekend experience. Fairly priced, you don't feel guilty about splurging and adding on a glass of wine or champagne. The grounds are beautiful, especially the walk to the brick building where you pass through immaculately trimmed hedges and zigzag bushes to get to the main dining hall. The expansive ceilings give an airy and light feel to the space, and the lily-white walls and lattice windows opening to the patio and garden add to the relaxed and classy atmosphere. The lighting is amazing (no irritating or blinding glare), the royal china is delicate and beautiful--a faint Tiffany blue with gold, and the sweets and savories are made fresh so you won't run into any dried bread or stale scones. Presentation is simplistic and classy. Add-on options: Pimm's, champagne, wine, etc.Sweets: orange and currant scone with clotted cream and strawberry jam, chocolate and jam cakes, lemon and chocolate mousse. Savories: egg mayonnaise, chicken wrap, smoked salmon and cream cheese mini bagel, and cucumber and fresh mint sandwich.Drinks: loose leaf teas, infusions, espresso drinks, miscellaneous cold bevvies like ginger beer, lagers, and juices. The waitstaff never made us feel as if the affair must be rushed, so we didn't have to hurry along with our drinks and fare. Reservations highly recommended as the line to get in can range from an hour to two, especially midday on weekends. Patio seating beneath umbrellas is an option as well.",

My high tea came with three layers: Assorted sandwiches, sconey bun, almond moon cake and shortbread. Palace breakfast tea with milk. Just like average high tea.Sitting next table there were British girls celebrating sweet sixteen. Some tourists like me on the other end just sipping the tea and spacing out. Service was attentive.

As a tourist with a tight schedule, I loved the idea of killing two birds with one stone. \u00a0I made a reservation online for 3pm on a Friday. My mom and I were seated as we arrived in the all white room with high ceilings. We opted for the English Orangery Afternoon Tea for \u00a326.00 per person. The china was beautiful and the ambiance was lovely. I chose the lemon and ginger tea and my mom selected the wild berries tea. The tea was accompanied by a three tiered tower of mini sandwiches, scones, and sweets. My favorite selections of food were the scones, chicken wrap, and the lemon mousse (or whatever it was). This was our lunch for the day and we left feeling satisfied. I especially enjoyed being able to sit, relax, and admire the view of the perfectly manicured palace garden. We weren't sure how fancy to dress, so we went with black dress pants and cardigan sweaters, others were dressed more causally. I imagine this place would be a great location for a bridal shower or brunch. If only I lived closer!",

The location is wonderful, and it is just behind Kensington Palace. I ordered the afternoon tea, which was quite delicious. The tea came with several different kinds of fingers sandwiches, I particularly liked the coronation chicken roll and the ham and mustard. Biscuits, one plain with dried fruit and the other orange scented were on the next plate. The final plate had a macaroon, clotted cream, and a small cake. I particularly liked the clotted cream. The table was set beautifully. The plates and cups were of gorgeous pattern as were the views. I am pleased with my afternoon tea experience and hope to go back on a future trip to London.",

The Afternoon Tea served here was fresh, modern and at a reasonable price. The setting can't be beat. You can sit inside or out with a view of the gardens. Can't go wrong with either. Our server was polite and helpful, even asking to take our picture. We opted for the Royal Afternoon Tea which included an adult drink (Pimms or Champagne). The tea sandwiches, scones and pastries were all delicious. I'd recommend making a booking, especially during the summer months. Definitely one of my favorite afternoon teas in London!",

Attempted to go for tea with a friend while visiting London and we weren't able to make a reservation on the website so we called various times with no answer, no answering machine and no information on walk-ins for tea. Finally decided to call the Museum and they said to just come in as they do accept walk-ins. Tube was partly down in our area so had to take a bus then tube over but once we got there, they were closed that day for a private event. Annoyed that they had no notice indicating that on their website or phone message, or informing the museum staff to avoid this situation. The real horror is the fact I emailed the manager of the restaurant and facility and never got a response. I emailed about 5 separate times only to receive automated messages saying they are away on vacation then to be forwarded another email. I'd then try emailing that one and never getting any responses. I eventually started to get aggressive in my emails demanding a response as this was ridiculous for a restaurant and still no response. I can't believe the lack of customer service and would not suggest anyone to go here or hold an event here due to the staff and service or lack there of. In my experience I never once spoke to a single soul no matter how many times I called or emailed, very embarrassing as I've never experienced such bad service in life anywhere I've traveled.",

    "text": "There is no other better place to get afternoon high tea then in this beautiful garden and former royal residence. Yes, it is extremely pricey but as I was visiting London, it felt like the price to pay. Getting to the Orangery is a bit of a long walk, so definitely add in at least fifteen minutes before if you have never been here before. There are a variety of teas and I was excited to see a green tea option because Europe is all about their black teas, which I am not the biggest fan of. The high tea option didn't come with as much food as I thought it would. For two people, we had a single three tiered plated contraption. At other tea places (albeit in the US), it would be one per person but oh well. The cream and strawberry jam is so delicious. We smeared everything all over our scones. The sandwiches were atypical. Their mint sandwich bites have less cream or mayo then other tea places. There is also a more expensive option to have champagne instead of tea.You're paying more for the atmosphere than anything else. It's not the best food or teas I have had but one of the nicer places I have been for high tea. The staff was really nice and are more than happy to take pictures for you. What better way to prove you've been here than pictures, obviously?",

The same thing happened to another female restaurant patron, and we both complained to the management. The management took little to no action to rectify the situation. They said they would find out who the perpetrator was via security cameras, but then they claimed that \"the perpetrator must know exactly when the cameras are turned away\" and did nothing further. If this is indeed the case, then, this type of incident occurs frequently at The Orangery, and I would advise you not to use the restrooms. This occurred during my afternoon tea so needless to say, I did not enjoy my tea. At the end, I was still expected to pay full price for the tea. The management did not offer a discount or anything to make them seem sorry for what had occurred. While it is not their fault, I was expecting them to it more seriously that there is a sexual predator targeting their business, to fully investigate the issue and offer some level of empathy.",

Light as a feather mashed potatoes glazed carrots, perfect Yorkshire pud with the sausages. We shared, we liked it a whole lot \u00a0and then we had . The bread & butter pudding was extraordinarily good - oh yes, it was and I shouldn't have had dessert and if were going to, I shouldn't have chosen the raspberry meringue with cream and berries. It was delicious but stop me next time, OK? Very good cafeti\u00e8re coffee - just a very small glitch with timing. Otherwise, very good service from start to finish, friendly, attentive and not pushy. Great way to break a walk around the Parks. Go for lunch, or for a small snack and a glass of wine",

We took the outdoor seating which actually wasn't as preferred by other people. 2 parties turned it down to wait for a table indoors. The selection on the menu isn't large. The prices were pretty expensive too running around 15-27pounds a person. But it was my first time and the view is gorgeous, so why not. We each got our own tea sets, I got the Debutante tea. I ordered Earl Grey and it turned out very lovely. The finger sandwiches were less than par, in my opinion, but the scones were very scrumptious. The clotted cream and fruit preserves really balanced each other out. I wasn't able to finish the chocolate cake that came with mine. It wasn't as sweet as it looked but I was stuffed by everything. It also seemed like a regular chocolate ganache cake. I'm sure I would've been able to get better tea somewhere else, but it was a wonderful first experience.",

    "text": "When in London... You must have afternoon tea! And what better place to do it than at the Kensington Palace? I really enjoyed my time at the Orangery. I recommend making a reservation. It is accessible with the tube. The tea room is so lovely! I like the high ceilings and wide windows. We sat by the windows and it was really bright and sunny. At one point, I had to wear my sunglasses. We came here for the afternoon tea. Each person gets his/her own tea pot so don't worry about compromising on the tea to order. I ordered the organic Chinese sencha and it was so fragrant, light, and soothing. If you like green tea, I recommend trying that. My favorites from the tea set are smoked salmon and cream cheese mini bagel and cucumber and fresh mint sandwich. The staff members here are very attentive and friendly. The only part I did not like about this place is that the restrooms are outdoors, which makes it a little inconvenient. After the afternoon tea, you can take a nice stroll around the garden and Kensington Palace!",

    "text": "When in London, one must have afternoon tea. And what better place to have afternoon tea than The Orangery at Kensington Palace, the residence of the British Royal Family since the 17th century?I made a reservation in advance and wandered around the gardens in the palace on my way to the restaurant. The restaurant is very grand with tall ceilings. It definitely feels like I was one of the royals. While I was at the restaurant I also learned a brief history of how afternoon tea came about. It was back in the 19th century when Anna, the 7th Duchess of Bedford complained of a \"sinking feeling\" in the late afternoon. Back in the days the British had 2 main meals during the day, which was breakfast and dinner. Anna then had her servants bring in a pot of tea and some light snacks for her in private in the late afternoon. Then later, Anna started invited her friends over during this hour to join her for afternoon tea and snack. At my visit in London, I got a taste of enjoying tea at the royal palace!For \u00a327.50 per person, you get a nice selection of sandwiches and pastries and a choice of your own tea pot or coffee. The scones and pastries were amazing. The sandwiches were delicious. I especially like the ham sandwich. For some reason it reminds me of the sandwiches in Hong Kong, which is heavily influenced by the British because it was a British colony for over 150 years. I got the earl grey tea and it was lovely and paired well with the food. The service was also really good. The server was attentive and courteous. I am also a sucker for people who speak to me in British accent. I was overall impressed by my experience here!",

The decor whispers elegant simplicity; there's something sophisticated, but not stuffy, about the building's high ceilings, grand pillars, & beautiful crown molding. Afternoon Tea here (\u00a327.50/person) was a lovely occasion. Tall windows offered direct views of the outdoor surroundings from our table. I chose Lady Grey tea, a sweeter version of Earl Grey made with blue flowers that went so well with milk & sugar. He ordered lemonade. Our three-tiered extravaganza arrived with various sweet bites like amazing marzipan tea cakes & mousse topped with meringue; scones; & crustless sandwiches (with the ham & English mustard being most delicious & the coronation chicken being my least favorite.) Was surprised to not find crumpets a part of this carb fest. Sidenote: bathrooms are located in a separate area outside of the restaurant; being your coat if it's nippy out.",

The price per person was fairly high at 27.50\u00a3/person ($40/person in USD), but we knew that going into it.The Orangery itself is situated just outside of Kensington Palace in a separate building near the gardens. The building and interior is very classy, yet casual. There is nothing \"ornate\" about it, but you feel like you're in an upscale setting. From my American perspective, it's everything I would have envisioned for an afternoon tea in London.We ordered the \"English Orangery Afternoon Tea\" and received all of its accompaniments. My two favorite things were the smoked salmon & cream cheese on a mini bagel along with the coronation chicken wrap. The smoked salmon was perfectly tender, the cream cheese very creamy and light, and the mini bagel was incredibly soft and fresh. The coronation wrap had incredible flavor and was seasoned with a mix of Indian seasons which caused the flavor of the wrap to \"pop\" over the menu items.My wife and I were able to eat everything they brought to us and get full, but if you're extremely hungry know that this will not be an entirely satisfying experience. It's afternoon tea so it's not intended to be a meal substitute. As for tea, she went with the Palace Breakfast which is their strongest black tea while I enjoyed the Royal London blend. Overall we had a great experience with excellent service! And for my wife, it was a \"London bucket list\" item so I'm glad we did it.",

This is what give you the three tiered set of finger sandwiches, biscuit, and desserts - eye candy. And most importantly, tea refills if you're jittery from low caffeine, or... too much of.. Also, if you care about photos as much as my wife does, you'll be satisfied with the beautiful tea set, the people, and the desserts :) Hope you stop by to enjoy the exotic herbal scents travel gracefully from your nose to your tongue with each sip My 5 stars: for overall experience and friendly staff.",

We got the eucalyptus zest tea and the wild berry tea and both were wonderful! Highly recommend. Also got the eggs benedict, which had a delicious hollandaise (eggs were slightly under salted), and a croissant with ham and mature cheddar. For an after breakfast (or dessert if you believe in dessert in the morning) we had a cheese board and the berry crumble. The cheese came with a delicious apple jelly.",

The smoked salmon was about two bites, but delightful. \u00a0Egg sandwich, chicken wrap, and mint and cucumber sandwiches were good but nothing out of the ordinary. \u00a0Didn't care for the ham sandwich. \u00a0The scones were light, fluffy and moist. \u00a0I always enjoy the clotted cream and jam too! \u00a0Lemon curd with the meringue was a little diffcult to eat but it was refreshing. \u00a0We enjoyed the macaroon and mini cake slice later on as we took it for take away. \u00a0I'm used to a little more variety whenever I go out for tea honestly, but the quality is there at The Orangery though. \u00a0As for his risotto it sure was plentiful. \u00a0We couldn't taste much of the mint, but the consistency of the risotto was pretty spot on and the truffle was light as well. \u00a0The risotto had a ton of peas in it. \u00a0We wished service was a little more attentive, but overall it was a nice lunch break at such a wonderful palace tucked away in the serene gardens.",

The scones were good, the sandwiches sub-par, and the desserts were absolutely inedible.Service was dismal. The waiter acted like we was annoyed by us and barely spoke to us. And, this is not the restaurant's fault per se, but there were two girls sitting by us who took selfies for about 30 minutes straight with the sound turned all the way up on their phones. The constant sound of a camera shutter was enough to ruin an already disappointing experience. The waiter should have told them to at least turn the sound off on their phones.I would NOT recommend coming here.",

    "text": "YES! Can you believe this place made me love tea after disliking it for years?! It is possible. Or maybe I just refused to sip any sort of sweetened tea with yummy flavors (flavours?) before I stepped foot inside this island paradise.I went to London for a bit last summer to study abroad, which was the best decision I've ever made; I had an amazing time. This was one of the reasons why, and the first time I went here (because some of us went twice during our three-week stay) was one of my favorite days out of the entire trip. Four of us visited Kensington Palace and then walked briskly over to The Orangery. One of our pals left because she wasn't feeling well, but the three of us ended up having a pretty lol time. Our waiter, whos name I completely forgot, was really cool. My friend had a huge crush on him! She would talk about him our entire meal and every time he came by they seemed to flirt a lot, and he would always say something to us like \"That's because you're American!\" or \"That's what women do!\" He was kind of cute though, and I figured he was a wannabe model or actor type, and when my friend had the guts to give him her number after our meal, she told us he was indeed an aspiring actor with dreams of attending drama school at NYU someday. Go, you!Anyway, I believed I ordered \"The Orangery\" meal (maybe they changed it to \"Signature Orange Tea\"?), which came with \"an assortment of finger sandwiches\" (it was so qt, I think it was the cream & chive sammich) and a small, delicious scone. I also had a random small wiener/pineapple/cheese deal, which my friend ate because I find it uncomfortable when sweets are mixed with meat. Anyway, we obviously had our choice of tea, to which there are a lot, & even though at that point I wasn't really a tea person, I ordered a cinnamon spice tea. When it arrived, I admittedly dumped it with sugar cubes but holy hell it was beyond amazing! I think I drank my entire pot of tea. :/ My friend ordered a mint tea which looked like a giant green plant was falling out of her tall glass, but it tasted good as well. We all enjoyed our meal and took pictures like any young tourist. I completely forgot what I had for dessert, or even if I had any at all.After our great experience, we walked around Hyde Park and talked. It was a great day.The second time I went, I met up with more people, and basically ordered the same thing (sexy waiter was nowhere to be seen!), except for dessert I remember ordering a gluten free chocolate hazelnut cake. Definitely did not taste the gluten. That was really good. I completely recommend anyone and everyone try this place at least once while visiting or living in London. I suggest taking a nice walk around Hyde Park afterward, as well. Thumbs up!",

    "text": "Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey, Dost sometimes counsel takeand sometimes tea. With these lines Alexander Pope forever linked in my mind Queen Anne and tea. So it is only appropriate that Queen Anne's little palace conservatory extension at Kensington Palace (1704, Sir John Vanburgh designed, no less, and three times over budget) now houses one of London's great places to take afternoon tea. The Queen's orange trees were housed in a sumptuous baroque space \u00a0soaring ceilings, windows and Corinthian columns; classical statuary and Grinling Gibbons carving. Apparently, she hosted al fresco summer supper parties here as well, hence the decoration. The all-white space works well for the modern caf\u00e9, with its rows of decorative metalwork furniture and dainty miniature orange trees on the tables. It seems to aim for the luxe tourist and/or well-heeled local; it is so nice to see this sort of thing being done well in this sort of location. The caf\u00e9 certainly lives up to its elevated architectural surrounds. Service was very friendly and obliging but perhaps a little off-focus: but the place was hopping all afternoon (Anne and I settled in for a lengthy gossip over pots of tea and cakes; there was no pressure on us to move out) We ordered the exclusive Tregothnan tea \u00a0the first tea to be actually grown in England (in Falmouth). One has to applaud the ambition \u00a0at 50\u00ba N it is the most northerly latitude at which a tea garden has been planted. However, great flavour requires high altitudes and \u00a0even as someone who prefers weak tea \u00a0I found this one slightly underpowered. Our cakes included lemon meringue (a generous slice with a tart lemon curd filling and just right crisp and chewy meringue topping), chocolate fudge cake, and an apricot and almond slice. A plate of prettily arranged dainty finger sandwiches included cucumber, smoked salmon and ham. A very successful afternoon, and I am sure Queen Anne would approve of her Orangery's modern incarnation. I'd definitely go again.",

We just stopped in for a snack in the afternoon (tea time!) and we were able to get a table right away...granted it was a weekday. For 5 people we ordered the English Orangery Tea set which came with a variety of tea sandwiches, orange scented scones with clotted cream and jam, a variety of tea pastries and the Royal London Blend Tea. We all got a small taste of everything so if you are actually stopping in for a proper tea, you might want to order more. The tea was, of course, delicious. With a touch of cream and sugar it was perfect with all the finger foods. The sandwiches were fresh and flavorful. The scone was fragrant and perfect. I looooove clotted cream, it is so good especially with the scone and jam. The pastries were ok but a nice sweet touch towards the end of tea. The 5 stars is primarily for the environment you're sitting in. The grounds at Kensington Palace are beautiful, especially the garden. You get a great view because of all the tall windows at the Orangery. And there's a certain fancy feeling you get just knowing that Princess Diana once lived there. I would definitely come back.",

Joe a pot of the Tregothnan. We are munching on a delicious fruit scone with just the right combination of clotted cream and jam. We are sitting outside enjoying the beautiful weather and the gorgeous view part of the gardens. Out of the corner of my eye, I spy a rather heavy set woman and her friend sit down at the table next to us. I continue nomming on my scone.Woman who is CLEARLY American, on the phone: OH MY GOD YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT I'M DOING NOW!!!Joe and I: We both blink and look at each other, and then at the woman out of the corner of our eyesWoman who clearly needs to get out more: I'M HAVING AFTERNOON TEA....AT KENSGINTON PALACEJoe and I are clearly embarrassed for every American ever as other person around her are beginning to stare and move their chairs away.Woman who won't get off the damn phone: YES I'M DRINKING CHAMPAGNE AND I HAVE ALL THESE DELICIOUS GOODIES AND I'M JUST GOING TO STUFF MYSELF SILLY (You think I'm kidding as I write this? She literally said that)At this point my right eye is twitching because she's called literally 5 different people and is being loud and obnoxious and crying about how much she misses being home and blah blah blah someone stick a knife in her PLEASE. I'm trying very hard to enjoy the delicious lemon cake that is sitting in front of me. The frosting is deliciously sweet and crunchy all at the same time, and this fat woman is hindering my experience. I feel bad for the woman's dining companion since she is being utterly ignored.After another 5 minutes of this I resolve that if she calls another person so-help-me-God I'm going to freak out on the lady. Joe and I are trying to hide the fact that we are American, because at this point, having to somehow connect ourselves to that stupid stupid woman is making me want to hand over my American passport and start screaming bloody hell where ever I go. Thankfully, I think she receives my telepathic screams to shut the hell up, and gets off the phone.The end of our rather enjoyable afternoon tea ends with questions of \"Do WE act like that?\" And breathing a sigh of relief that no, we do not carry a sign that says \"YES WE ARE AMERICAN PLEASE MAKE FUN OF US\"The End.",

I knew I wanted to try a real tea service, and I'm so glad it didn't cost me a fortune. The cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches were stacked elegantly, the scone with clotted cream was warm and delicious, and the tiny piece of orangery cake to finish off was perfect. I really miss Hyde Park and this beautiful little place to have some tea. I had cinnamon and it was wonderful. Hopefully I'll be back soon!",

    "text": "Long lines? Yes. Expensive? Check. Worth it? Absolutely! Sometimes a gal just has to treat herself and afternoon tea at the Orangery on the grounds of Kensington Palace (former home of Princess Diana) is just the way to do it. \u00a0There usually is some kind of wait, but honestly it's not more than the wait at popular brunch places in NYC. And the experience is better than any brunch I ever had in NYC. The long waits are not due to the bungling waiters or food taking a long time to be served. It's due to people not wanting to leave long after they have finished eating. Maybe they should take note of popular NY restaurants and impose a time limit. The scenery of the grounds and the atmosphere of the restaurant itself just makes one feel fancy. The English Breakfast tea was great (tea leaves only here, no tea bags), the scones with jam and clotted cream were the best I ever ate on any side of the pond, and the finger sandwiches and little cakes/tarts were delicious. \u00a0I also found the service to be polite, friendly, and impeccable. For example, one of the sandwiches had ham in it and the waiter saw my scarf and knew automatically not to bring me pork. When I asked what was in the sandwiches he said, smoked salmon, egg, cucumber, and ham, but you don't want the ham right? \u00a0He brought me 2 smoked salmon sandwiches instead. In the US I always have to spell out that I can't eat pork so I was pleasantly surprised. Anyway people in the UK just seem to be more culturally aware and accepting, but I digress. The Orangery is worth at last one visit and I know that whenever I'm in London again I'm heading right over.",

The scones were warm and fresh. The sandwiches came in wheat bread which I didn't mind but my fianc\u00e9 hated.

The sandwiches that stood out for me were the smoked salmon with cream cheese, egg mayo, and one with curry chicken. I ordered a green tea and my friend ordered the oolong. The oolong was my favorite, but both were good. The raspberry fruit pudding (?) was small but I really liked it. Ambiance of this place is great. The space is really open and large and it feels like you're outdoors with the big doors and windows. The view is awesome - you're looking straight into Kensington gardens. Prices were very fair compared to the other high tea places in London which can go for \u00a360 pp. The orangery was about \u00a330 pp but so worth it for the experience.

The teas all have different flavors and if you ask the server, they can help give you details. Comes with cream & sugar if you want that. You get 1 pot and one type of tea. Sandwiches- just ok. Cucumber & mint, cheese & what was apple? Or pear? Egg salad that was pretty bland, tomato and something or other. Bread was your average white bread. Biscuits- came with some jam and clotted cream. Both were pretty good. Not outstanding, but quite good. Desserts- kind of, boring? Just ok. 2 out of the 3 were mousses. The last one was a cake that was just, normal. Nothing memorable.

    "text": "BEST tea experience I've ever had (without a doubt preferred this over Sketch and the Plaza in NYC). The highlight of my London experience! Not only is the location stunning, charming, and regal, but the prices are affordable and the tea food itself is actually good. Amazing scones, to-die for desserts, and killer cappuccinos (you can opt for coffee instead of tea during the \"tea\" itself which I appreciated). The staff was nice, not rushed, and truly made our group of young twenty-somethings feel like princesses. Another bonus is that you can make reservations online on open table... so easy.Highly recommend popping into Kensington Palace itself (and the gift shop!) before/after tea. This was an unexpected detour but the history and charm just emanates and will add to the tea experience!",

    "text": "The Orangery is the perfect place to indulge in a traditional English high tea experience after a visit to the Kensington Palace and Garden.Tip: \u00a0Admissions are required only if you visit the Kensington Palace. \u00a0If you visit only the garden and the restaurant, no tickets are required.The restaurant is elegant in a way that is simple yet sophisticated, but not overly opulent. \u00a0The vibes are relaxed, cool, and unpretentious.Service was a bit slow in the beginning. \u00a0We were seated for about ten minutes before our server greeted us.Our server did apologize for the wait and she was upbeat and friendly. \u00a0She offered to take pictures for us with the high tea setting which I think was a very nice gesture. \u00a0She offered to do the same for other customers too. \u00a0So I'm sure she is used to doing this numerous times a day every day. \u00a0In fact, she is a pro - she took some very nice pictures for us at the perfect angles!An afternoon tea set comes complete with the following:-- A selection of finger sandwiches which include turkey and cranberry, ham with my favorite English mustard, egg mayonnaise, smoked salmon, and cucumber & mint.-- Two different types of freshly baked scones (that day we had a plain vanilla one and a currant scone) served with English jams. (Compared with American jams, the English version is usually fruitier in taste, only lightly sweet, and not sugary.)-- An assortment of pastries and mousses. \u00a0The day we were there we had a slice of Christmas fruit cake, a key lime mousse, a cherry pastry among other goodies. \u00a0The fruit cake, with a rich aroma of rum, was very yummy and was my favorite sweet of the day. -- Your choice of tea or coffee (when in England for high tea, forget about coffee and order tea.) \u00a0If you like a very strong cup of tea, try the Palace Breakfast which is a blend of Assam and Ceylon black teas. \u00a0I personally like the Afternoon at the Palace which is a black tea with a smoother and lighter taste.It was a delightful experience and I won't hesitate for a second to do this again the next time I'm in London.",

It's a little pricey and the tea and snacks are really nothing special but what you're paying for is the fantastic ambiance and having an opportunity to walk around the Kensington palace gardens afterwards. If you don't visit London often (this was our first time), I'm glad we had this experience. I probably won't do afternoon tea again if we ever come back so it's nice to have our one experience here.",

    "text": "While in London, I wanted to treat my wife to a proper English tea. Why not at a Kensington Palace I thought to make the experience most memorable?I easily made the reservations online and we made sure we dressed for the occasion. I even learned how to fold pocket squares to complete the look for my suit! Purple is my 2016 color of choice and purple shirt with purple paisley tie is how I offset the black jacket. I think I looked smashing, especially compared to a few guests, let's call them barbarians, who wore jeans to English high tea at the The Orangery. I know you can but does that mean you should? We took an Uber and splurged for a select model for once. It was nice tooling around London in a spacious Audi A6. However, we discovered finding this place was a bit tricky. Luckily, a palace guard gave us directions to drive down a pedestrian walkway and then walk through a gate to The Orangery. The interior was quite spacious and serene. The only shortcoming was the lack of music but we enjoyed our conversation instead! Lukas, the manager, was quite friendly and even forgave me my transgression for ordering a double espresso with my tea. I consumed it quickly and they took away the offending cup immediately to dispose of the evidence. When we found our table to be slightly tippy, Lukas graciously explained the building was created in 1689 and the floors were no longer perfectly level. He adjusted the table and all was well!We selected the tea with champagne course because, well, because we could! Nothing makes tea better than champagne after all! Agree? The scones and jam were tasty as well as the little tea sandwiches. The china everything was served on was truly royal and stunning in its timeless beauty! The highlight for me were the desserts which were all scrumptious! One was a lemon mouse with a meringue topping. The next was a wonderful fruit cake with creamy frosting. Finally, there was a creamy chocolate confection covered in sweet, crunchy caramel. I tried all three with no regrets!I highly recommend the experience, once in your life. Just do it.",

The chicken sandwich was my favorite as it was spiced with a little bit of curry. Overall, all the sandwiches were great. The scones...omg so good with a little butter & jam.

    "text": "We came here for breakfast and it was one of the highlights of our trip! It was our first time in London so we wanted to enjoy tea somewhere nice, but didn't want to splurge on a traditional afternoon tea. We decided to come here to start off our day in Hyde park. Although it's not on the menu, they offer cream tea (scones, jam, clotted cream and a pot of your choice of tea) so just ask your server about it. I've never been too much of a tea person, so I don't have any strong preferences. I went with our server's recommendation and chose the Earl Grey Blue Flowers (if memory serves right) and it was the best tea I've ever had, I was surprised by how much I loved it. Strongly recommend. The scones, jam and clotted cream were also pleasant, although nothing too special. \u00a0My friend ordered the croissant which was perfectly flakey and delicious.The standout was the hot waffle with caramel apples and cinnamon cream. OH MY GOD. I literally have not stopped thinking about this waffle in the months since I've had it, it's that good. If you're not into sweets for breakfast then I probably wouldn't recommend it, but it's a super indulgent way to start your day. The waffle is perfectly cooked and the cinnamon cream is the perfect compliment to the apples and light caramel sauce. They all melt together for an incredibly delicious bite. It was also cheaper than I would have thought. My standards might be a little skewed being from NYC where everything is expensive, but the waffle was only \u00a36.95 which was maybe about $8.50 at the time. For the quality and chic atmosphere of the restaurant I would have easily paid $12-$15 for that in NYC. Speaking of atmosphere, the restaurant felt very upscale although the prices didn't really reflect that (ideal scenario). It was a very beautiful setting, with the white walls, flowers and beautiful China. It was also nearly empty on a weekday morning. We weren't aware of the type of atmosphere before hand, but I felt perfectly in place in my ankle boots, skirt, sweater and black coat. My friend on the other hand wore sneakers, jeans and a sports jacket and felt really out of place (we had a long day of exploring ahead of us, I just tend to dress up normally which worked out). However, the staff welcomed us and were friendly so we felt comfortable regardless. But I would recommend dressing more on the business casual side of you want to feel in sync with the atmosphere for breakfast. Overall would definitely recommend this place for a pleasant breakfast to start your day. Great atmosphere, food and location. It was great to walk around the beautiful gardens right out outside the restaurant after our meal!",

Our concierge referred us to the Orangery and it did not disappoint!The day we decided to go for our visit was gloomy and rainy. We arrived to this nice building along the edge of Hyde Park and were greeted by the upbeat host. The room was huge, white and featured tall windows that over looked the green grass outside. Tables were lined up in two rows and had white linens. The space was beautiful.There was a nice mix of different people having tea. People that were dressed up, people just trying to seek refuge from the rain, and people just stopping in for a quick bite. We tried two different kinds of tea and I fell in love with the Royal Blend. We were served tea sandwiches, scones, and tea cakes, with clotted cream, lemon curd, and marmalade on the side. The fare was good and we were stuffed!I'd def. go back again!",

No warmth, no decor, echoes from others talking, stark white, restaurant-grade plates and cups, this was not the tea we envisioned. The food actually did look nice, but we left without partaking so I am adding one star assuming it was good, but the lack of any attempt at ambiance and decor makes my review only a 2 even with giving them that freebie star.

I chose Darjeeling Tea to wash this all down and the pot came with loose leaf tea, a silver strainer and a silver holder for the strainer once I began using it. \u00a0It is all posh and proper. \u00a0The price tag on this particular tea service was about $22 per person. \u00a0The Orangery is also licensed and champagne with or without orange juice is also on the menu. \u00a0In the end...what did I learn about high tea....well, I learned that cream cheese and cucumber sandwiches suck big time. \u00a0Bland and boring. \u00a0The scones however, when served hot and fresh and slathered with clotted cream are ambrosial. \u00a0If I were to do it again I'd have settled for some tea and a double order of the scones. \u00a0The room itself, the Orangery, is magnificient and is pure homage to all that is English and all that is proper. \u00a0Those china tiered plates all loaded up with tarts, sweets and sandwiches are just so pretty to look at and I had to fend off feeling a bit like a British debutant when our waiter walked towards. \u00a0What a moment, sitting there having tea, quaffing down Orange Cake and looking out on to the gardens in Kensington. \u00a0I've pasted up a couple of pics just to give you an idea of what this architectural monument to a tea service looks like. \u00a0Next time in London town, be sure to take in High Tea at the Orangery.",

    "text": "Take it from me, the afternoon tea at The Orangery is treading nervously between two sides of a pool - the expensive luxury tea services of classic London hotels, and the cheap and cheerful tea+cakes found in the cafes of National Trust houses and castles all over the land. The result - at \u00a315 to \u00a325 per person, is simply not worth it. Better to go full-on and splash the cash at a name-drop hotel or spend half-as-much somewhere like Fulham Palace or Windsor Castle.It's not that it's not beautiful here. It's a stunning conversion of the Kensington Palace greenhouse that never quite worked out (not enough light gets in for growing oranges). High ceilings, marble statues, views out into the Palace gardens and Hyde Park beyond. It's even rentable for weddings, and if you have the cash for that sort of thing, then be my guest... or rather, let me be one of your guests.But the ambiance and prestige of the location are let down by simple uncomfortable tables and chairs, rudimentary service and poor excuses for cucumber finger sandwiches which are constructed on your plate into strange jenga formations - should this be 'tea-henge'? Plus it's not exactly the Ritz when the toilet is outside in a port-a-kabin, is it?The scones are cracking though, and the tea selection is mighty cool, even featuring tea grown in England (well i never)! So that kind of makes up for the disappointments elsewhere. But not quite.The moral of the story... don't come expecting a real treat of an afternoon tea service - the luxury side can't be got on the cheap in London. Better to just treat the Orangery as a place to drop in for a pot of brew and some dead good scones.",

We thought our server was nice she was definitely holding too many tables though. Which of course in turn made our service slow. I am not gonna blame Miriam our server cause she was moving, just had to cover too many bases(more on service later) I went wimpy and just ordered a Prosecco, knowing full well the family would over order. So Rose Prosecco perfect, Bitter Ale very nice(i like the 500ml bottles), LA Croix White Languedoc perfect citrus peel on the nose. We tried to order a variety of things off the menu and everything was fairly tasty. The scones were over the top clotted cream will do that. Cheese plate was solid and the tea sandwiches were all pretty good though a little dry. All in all a great experience if you have a little princess she will love it.",

    "text": "While on a visit to London from my family's house, we were hell-bent to get a cream tea. Originally, we had intended to go to Harrods however upon looking at the menus online, we didn't find it all too enthralling. Upon a quick search on Yelp, I find the Orangery. We were not disappointed.The Orangery is just off Kensington High Street (tube station) on District/Circle. It's easy to get to, and to find the restaurant you have to walk through the lovely park. We were seated immediately, handed menus, and we got the Signature Orange Tea. There is a wide selection of teas. My fellow diners ordered the Tregothnan teas. I ordered a cappuccino, as I'm not too fond of teas. I heard great things about the teas, and my cappuccino was very nice. They were accommodating with my vegetarianism, and only gave me vegetarian sandwiches, which was very nice. The orange-scented scone with clotted cream was to die for and the orange and passion fruit tart is not something you want to miss.While I'm not one for \"fine dining\" this was a very pleasant experience. The service could have been more attentive, however, the food was excellent. Make sure if you need the restroom that you ask, as it is out around the building, and you need a keycode. Overall, a very nice experience. I would return!",

The restaurant is situated in Kensington Palace Gardens, just a few steps away from Kensington Palace. Afternoon tea begins at three.The tea room is flooded with light, and tiny orange trees adorn each tabletop. The environment here is peaceful, unpretentious and easy. The prices may be higher than one might expect for such a refreshingly informal atmosphere, but for a well-steeped pot of leaves and one of the nicest views in all of London, do rest assured that it's worth the visit.",

They don't give you much tea either. I also ordered a rose spumante and the waiter brought me some very different champagne, which I didn't want to make a scene about so I took it but it ended up costing \u00a34 more once I got the bill. \u00a0The sandwiches were ok, pastries weren't amazing by any standards. \u00a0I saw the waiter once and he never looked at me again, I ended up having to wait around for the bus person to request the bill. \u00a0Overall with the wait and poor service and mediocre food I wouldn't recommend it especially for a solo traveler. \u00a0I had a better tea experience at National Portrait Gallery cafe.",

    "text": "As an avid fan for tea parties, I have to give The Orangery a rounded up 3.5 stars. This being my first time in London, I was giddy about the prospect of having afternoon tea in very place it originated from and that being said, I was definitely looked forward to the Orangery. Located in the Kensington Gardens, the first thing you notice about the Orangery is how impressive it looks right down to the little orange plants on your table. The colonial mansion houses an elegant white restaurant with wide open space to make your experience as leisurely as possible. There aren't too many times you can say you had tea on palace grounds and so a trip to the Orangery is worth that alone. The enviable view and ambiance is part of the reason we had to wait in a queue for about 30 minutes just to be seated but the brisk and pleasant service more than made up for that. We ordered their Signature Orange Tea (about \u00a315 pp) with The Orangery House Tea and the Chocolate/Caramel Tea. Both teas were excellent but the creaminess of the Chocolate/Caramel tea gave it a slight edge.The finger sandwiches including the cucumber and salmon sandwiches were good but not great which is an appropriate description of the scones and pastries. The clotted cream was a nice addition but in terms of food, nothing from the tower really stood out. As for the desserts at the top of the tower, one of them had a neat imprint of one of the royal members of Kensington Palace but aside from that, I was not impressed.  Overall, I thought The Orangery was a lot like Victoria Secret models. Sure,it's nice to look at but there really isn't a lot of substance beyond that. If The Orangery ends up improving on their food, I think it would be a five-star experience especially considering the price is definitely reasonable. That said, The Orangery is a solid but not spectacular choice for afternoon tea in London. Not for tea purists but still a good choice for anyone who likes to enjoy spot of good tea and a dainty lounging experience.",

I ordered the mixed berries tea to drink and a lemonade. I can honestly say that that was the best tea I have ever had I regret not buying some to take back home with me. I loved almost everything that came out with the tray. I wasn't that fond of the cucumber sandwiches but that's just my personal preference I don't really like them. I'm sure people who enjoy them would have enjoyed theirs. Everything was superb from the service to the location, and the food. I would love to come back here again.

Glad we took a seat inside as the sun was beating down very hard and we were already very hot inside nearby the window. I ordered a fruit salad with yogurt and a black tea (afternoon in the palace). The yogurt in the fruit salad was not sweet, possibly more like the Greek yogurts which I do not fancy too much. My black tea was great. The plateware at this place is so pretty, definitely have a tea over a beer/cocktail just so you can use the fancy China! My husband got the full english breakfast with eggs sausage bacon and mushroom/tomatoe. It was not very filling for him and nothing too exciting to report from it. They do serve bread when you are seated and it comes with jam and butter. He also ordered an english iced tea which was very delightful and refreshing. I wanted to order the trio of dessert shots with my order but was told from waitor that I had to wait until 12 to order that since its from lunch menu. (Howver breakfast and lunch items were printed on same menu). We finished our food at maybe 15 minutes before 12. I asked the waitor if I could order the dessert but unfortunate they are quite strict on their lunch service time. We waited the 15 minutes to order he dessert. Well worth the wait tho! Vanilla chocolate and lemon dessert shots were all very rich and delicious! If you love sweets, don't miss out on them.",

I was really excited to have tea in London, since I only just had my first British style afternoon tea last December at the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong, and it was amazing there! When we arrived on a Wednesday at 4:30, the place was not even half filled. The scenery outside is lovely though, and we were seated at a table by the window. Too bad the week had been gray and rainiy, otherwise the view would have been splendid. We ordered the regular afternoon tea (with no wine or champagne). The Earl Grey Blue Flowers was pretty good and the Hubs ordered the Darjeeling which was eh. The sandwiches were OK. They looked and tasted like ones you could make at home, especially the ham and mustard one. The scones, plain and raisin, with clotted cream and jam were tasty. The other little cakes and tarts were average to above average. The macaron was disgusting...tasted a bit stiff...they should leave the macaron making up to the French! Even my amateur macarons taste better than theirs (not to boast, but you can ask the Hubs and my co-workers). So maybe my expectations for this place were too high and the weather was not great, but I'd prefer to have some fancier looking and tasting food if I am to go out for tea.",

Give yourself some time before or after tea to walk around the gardens. \u00a0They're very well maintained and gorgeous. Luckily the day I went with my gf it was nice and sunny so it was a perfect day to walk around the palace grounds. The restaurant itself is a big white room and I didn't think it was anything spectacular. \u00a0It does have a sophisticated vibe to it which is what most tea places go for as far as I can tell. The service was decent but not as good as I would expect for the price point. \u00a0The server was nice but not attentive as I would have liked. \u00a0I needed more hot water for my tea, but it took awhile to get service. \u00a0The tea and tea sandwiches were delicious as well as the desserts and scones that came with our afternoon tea. I remember that the scones had a hint of orange to them which was a nice touch. \u00a0Overall I enjoyed the experience but for 25 pounds a person I expected a little bit better service.",

Our order was taken quickly, but (and this may be the ravenous hunger talking) we were quite convinced the server had forgotten our food because although the tea came the sandwiches and pastries took forever. No matter, once they arrived the food was good. Although I would be happy to simply have scones with cream/jam (and not pay \u00a324/p), it was a lovely afternoon and a worthwhile place to bring out-of-town guests. After all, who doesn't like to send their Mom a photo from \"Kensington Palace\" (which isn't entirely untrue)? In any case, it was lovely, less expensive than some alternative High Tea services, and enjoyable; just not somewhere I'd visit except for a special occasion (based largely on price).",

The staff came by 2x; once to take my order and once to remove my plate. I then went to pay and they tack on 3 pound gratuity automatically. I was not intending to tip because there was no customer service but paid it because I felt embarrassed not to. You are paying purely for ambiance as the afternoon tea is nothing amazing. This is the place to go to for us Americans to have the afternoon tea experience but not pay as much as going to a fancier place. Still very, very overpriced. I also never received clotted cream They just gave me butter. WTF?",

    "text": "As far as afternoon tea places go, you could certainly do worse than The Orangery. Then again, you could also do better, especially in a city teeming with different options like London. It goes without saying that the venue and atmosphere is second to none - you can't really beat being right next to Kensington Palace! The decor is elegant and refined without feeling too formal or stuffy, and you're surrounded by some of the most perfectly manicured gardens and grounds in the world. And considering the prime location, the \u00a324 price for the basic afternoon tea is a steal. So if you're looking just to check the \"I had afternoon tea in England!\" experience off your sightseeing to-do list, The Orangery is a fine place to go.What really didn't impress me was the food itself, and the service. While the tea selection is fantastic, the sandwiches were dry and stale, and weren't particularly creative or inspired. The scones were fine but nothing to write home about, and the desserts sadly also tasted old, as if they'd been sitting out for some time. With regards to the service, I'm trying to pinpoint exactly what bugged me the most: the host who, upon seeing my name in the reservation book, showed me to my table without even looking me in the eye and just dumped the menus on the table before stalking away (despite being super lovely and friendly to the pair before me); seeing the manager personally greet every single table BUT ours; or having to flag down waiters every single time we needed our hot water refilled since nobody cared to check in on us in the 2+ hours we were there (despite noticing them checking in on every other table around us). My friend and I were both baffled by how we seemed to be singled out and treated - who knows, maybe we smelled or something - and it made the entire experience quite uncomfortable and unpleasant. What a disappointment.",

Located in the Kensington Gardens, it's a cute little building with grecian/roman architecture (meaning pillars and busts everywhere). The path leading up to the main entrance is surrounded by huge cylindrical shrubs. The interior is v. white and bright and each table has a little orange tree to decorate it.They offer some elaborate teas (that come with champagne, various salads or finger sandwiches, desserts) and you can pick the one most appealing to you. I've had both the darjeeling tea and chamomile tea here. I'm not a fan of the chamomile but the darjeeling was amazing. It was really fragrant and delicious. The teas are accompanied by a cute little dish of sugar cubes (both brown and white) and a little jug of milk.There's a huge selection of pastries and baked goods. I highly recommend getting a scone with clotted cream. They're really fresh and moist and delicious. But I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything you order. Everything I've eaten here has been incredible.Admittedly, it is a bit pricey, but it's worth the experience.",
