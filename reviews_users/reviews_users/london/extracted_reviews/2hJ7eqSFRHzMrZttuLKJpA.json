The buns are very good, a little like brioche bread. The french fries and courgette fries were perfectly crispy, and the drinks at the right temperature (THATCHERS OLD RASCAL CIDER was very nice, the Byron Lager was good).The service was fast, friendly and efficient. We were served quickly, and always with a smile.All in all a very good experience we will be sure to try again next time we're in London!",

Byron doesn't quite cut it for me, but the patties are fresh and the sides (like onion rings and courgette fries) are tasty. I find the burgers are on the expensive side given the volume (or lack thereof), so three star for the food, but the selection of milkshake deserves another star. Thick, creamy milkshake in vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, or Oreo. Oh yes, just how milkshakes should be! At the end of the evening, the waitress let slip that you can have milkshakes from their secret menu, including banana or toffee, or banana AND toffee! Shucks, now I have to go back.",

Burger didn't taste extra special, but it was still good. I also got some loaded fried to go along with it (fellow Americans - you will have to order fries with it - it doesn't just come with it like in the US).

    "text": "Came here on my last day in London. I'm bumping up to a 4 for really high quality service, but the food was just okay.Clearly I'm an American, so I know my burgers. What can I say, my country is filled with the obese and fat-loving community. I came here because I was just craving a burger and was amused by the \"holy cheesemus\" stuff on the outside. Not that I ordered it (Asian American, so lactose is my frienemy). I had the regular burger with a side of fries. The fries itself (crisps? No idea what the locals call it) were crunchy and yummy. When I ordered the burger, my waiter asked if I wanted it medium, and like a proper carnivore, I asked for mid-rare. Rare if it's a slab of steak (make note!). My burger came out...mid-well. It was a good tasting burger, and I didn't feel like being the jerk to send it back. It wasn't burnt or bad tasting, just not expected to get a mid-well. It even had a little flag saying it was mid-rare. It's fine...I realized during my time in London that the UK just doesn't know how to rare up meat.So at this point, I'd give a 3 star. But the manager (I learned later...) came by to grab my empty plates (points for managers who \"dirty\" their hands), and asked me how it was. I...hesitated and he kinda knew there was something off. I told him about the mid-rare thing and he asked if he could get me dessert or something. Being utterly stuffed, I declined and asked for the check. To my surprise, there was a 20% off. When I asked my waiter why, he said the manager took it off because of the mid-rare thing! NICE! \u00a0I don't blame the Byron, as I just figure that London doesn't know how to do American-style meat temps. So, I left the \"discount\" as a tip. Yes, I realize UK doesn't do tips. I'm still American and they can just think I paid full price.",

So much meat!!! It makes me happy... As for drinks, I love all the beers they have as well as the non alcoholic root beer that you can turn into a float by adding ice cream. So American!

    "text": "This chain seems to have popped up all over London...but I only got around to venturing in for the first time last night.It seems alright...the d\u00e9cor is a bit like a clean version of a grubby American diner. They must have worked hard to make such a new venue look so dilapidated!! However the booths are comfy, the staff were sweet and they were happy for me to occupy a large table and sip wine while I waited for the rest of my friends to arrive.The wines weren't bad. They are listed as 'good', 'better', 'great' and 'best'...I guess that makes it easier for people that don't know about wine, and for people that would like to show off by ordering the 'best' option. The menu isn't huge BUT surprisingly they do have some delicious sounding veggy choices, along with a 'skinny' option (swapping the burger bun for salad) and giant salads. I considered the skinny option for a couple of seconds, and then proceeded to order a cheese burger. When my dinner arrived, it turned out to be a 'Byron burger'- it wasn't what I ordered, but I figured the addition of bacon to a cheese burger isn't a terrible mistake...so didn't bother to complain. My vegetarian friend said the mushroom burger with red peppers and goats cheese was good...but I have to admit, it didn't look as impressive as the mountains of meat my other friends and I munched our way through!!I loooved the courgette fries! The other sides were pretty ordinary, but courgette fries are a fantastic idea. Nom nom nom!",

What makes this place awesome besides the beef patty is the pickle it comes with! it's perfect! crisp, tangy, not too sweet! next time can I get a full side of pickles with the burger?!?! \u00a0nom nom nom also added plus, our sever was super nice and friendly!!",

Billy no mates, I popped down after work and got a really warm greeting and advice from the young lady waiting on me. I had seen reviews for courgette fries so had to give this a whirl. Opted for the Byron burger with a side of bbq sauce. Incidentally, all their sauces are made in house, not bought in...Cooked to utter medium perfection, whilst retaining tenderness of the meat, \u00a0you simply could not ask for a better cooked burger. Quite a substantial size, I honestly struggled to finish it all. Only four stars as after a few fries, the novelty wore off and I wished I had normal fries. Some were a little soggy. Also, the in house pale ale was quite bitter and not that smooth. That said, I will be back again on my next trip in a few weeks. This place was queued out of the door at 6:30!! You Gotta Eat Here - For Sure!!",

    "text": "This one is a long time coming...The twitter version first: \"Byron is like Tina Turner; simply the best\".I am not a very big fan of old Tina but hey, you get the point.The Yelp review now...:Byron has the best value for money ratio in the burger industry. The quality and flavour of the meal are worth every single penny. For some, \u00a315 for a burger meal is a bit steep but I would honestly pay \u00a325 or even \u00a330 for a burger of this quality (specially when you compare it to other places in the \u00a315 range like GBK, Shake Shack or BRGR.CO).I've now reached a stage where I don't even look at the menu anymore so my review is not the best for those of you who want to know what options are available.But this I can tell you: a Byron Burger with French Fries and a strawberry milkshake will take you one mouthful closer to happiness. The portions have just the right size: full, but not to the point that you don't enjoy it. The bacon is fantastic, the fries delicious! The meat is second to none and according to them, sourced from the best producers in the UK (I firmly believe that that's true!). A beautiful detail: despite the delicious sauce, the bun never goes soggy. How can this be? I am telling you, at times this can be the most magical meal you'll ever had. It's borderline to science-fiction material!The staff is super friendly, super efficient. You usually get a table in no time and don't have to wait long for the food. Always with a smile on and casually talking to you without it feeling like they are intruding. Superb! Once, I handed one of the comments/feedback cards to the staff saying \"The only thing in life better than bacon is double-bacon\" - by the time I was about to leave the restaurant, a member of the staff came over and gave me a box with two slices of bacon inside. How brilliant is that?Another time, in Westfields, a member of the staff sat down with us for like 10 minutes and answered all our questions about the chain. Great stuff! Knew everything about it and was passionate about the product and brand. Fantastic customer service experience!In my opinion, Byron defines the standard for all other burgers in London. It is the best burger I've ever had and I will come back for more in years to come.",

That is apart from me. I've only been to two prior, one in Earl's Court and the other at some other London location. I was left unimpressed both times. Mainly with the quality of the food. Overtoasted bread, overcooked chicken. Fries nothing special. Really slow serviceAt this Byron however the experience was perfect. Giant Milkshake absolutely needs to be tried to be believed. The burger itself was stunning. I had the Byron burger with Chicken. Perfect distribution of toppings. Perfectly grilled bacon,Well presented. Not one greasy drip landed onto my basket whilst eating. The handcut chips were likewise perfectly cut, cooked and seasoned. Honestly, this burger looked put together by a food artist than a chef. Apologies if I've offended any food artist chefs.The interior is nothing special, and it was a little cold in the establishment, but my faith in Byron has been redeemed. However it will take at least another visit to \"The Cut\" branch, before I dare venture to other Byron's again.",

We both ordered the Byron burger (mine without cheese) and we both loved it. However, in my red meat-free opinion, the onion rings out-shined the burgers. I have no idea what type of edible magic they put in the batter, but those were the best onion rings I've ever had! We also shared a basket of shoestring fries, which were hot, crisp, and salty; the perfect combination. The waitstaff was really friendly, which is unusual for the UK. I also appreciated the selection of local beers. Next time I'm craving fatty American-style food, I will definitely return to Byron.",
