Europeans fear spice and thus all spicy cuisines are the bastard cousins of the actual food. The wait staff were so nice and truly cared for us. They were really fun and easy to joke with. England was playing the World Cup and it was fun to celebrate with them as the game progressed. The food did have some spice, which was nice, but it was still a pale reflection of Indian food. The flavors were on point too. Honestly, if you like Indian food and want a good place to hang out, this will work well. Even if you are not a fan of spice. Give it a go.",

I will say that they have decent prices and from the looks of things their lunch special is quite a deal.

The place is a little cozy (good thing for us we were the only customers there at the time!).We got the lunch special, which is an appetizer and entree (with rice) for about 12\u00a3 (I forget the actual price). The food was good, and portions decent for the price. I got the vegetable samosa, which was different than those I have had in the USA (the samosa wrapper was thin/flakey and not as doughy). I ordered the lentils with chicken. My partner got a lamb dish, but they switched the meats (so I got his lamb but with my lentils). We also got an order of naan to share.Definitely worth a try!",

Late Monday night and thankfully this spot had room available and the kitchen was still open.Lots of familiar options on the menu, yet opted for something different. Ordered the Butter Chicken Curry (\u00a39.50), Paratha (\u00a33), and a Cobra Beer (\u00a34.25). Beer comes out first, a very light lager that's not really good on its own; much better paired with food. Chicken and bread come out next - a creamy gravy with large chunks of boneless chicken swimming inside. Chicken is cooked well but the gravy had a grainy texture that I didn't care for. Paratha helped matters, despite the fact it resembled more of a roti.Service here is quick as they're efficient with the limited space they have. Didn't like the fact that the curry dish doesn't come with rice, so maybe better value in other dishes.",

The atmosphere was warm and inviting and we were greeted promptly and courteously by the staff. Our food - butter chicken, chicken rogan josh, and of course naan - was delicious. Very fresh and flavorful. And have to say Ali (and all the staff) were great. We are just visiting for the week, but plan to go back before our weeklong trip is over, and hope to return in future visits. Thanks!",

We were expecting this place to be good as well, especially since we were in London. The dishes were all just very watered down versions of what they could be. You can even tell by the pictures that the sauces had hardly any weight or body to them.",

    "text": "Taste of India totally changed my perception of Indian Cuisine. My three prior experience were all in the U.S. and with friends who claimed to be \"experts\" on Indian Foods. All three were terrible and kept me away from Indian Food for ten years. Visiting London for the first time everyone who had been here told us the Indian Restaurants were excellent. So with great trepidation we found ourselves in Taste of India. We were greeted warmly at the door and led to our table. We were seated next to a party of four. As we were perusing our menus the waiter was bringing a plethora of food to the four top next to us. It all looked so good, I asked the waiter what they had ordered. He told us that it was the sampling menu for four. The server a very nice gentleman named Ali suggested the same option for two. We took Ali's suggestion and the meal that followed was excellent. Ali did an expert job of describing each dish and how it was prepared. His service was impeccable. The prices were very reasonable about 43 pounds. We plan on making this our last stop before heading back home",

The Indian food in London is just too damn good! \u00a0My colleague and I walked into this beautifully for Indian restaurant who is seated at mediately by a waiter name Raj. We started our course with poppadom's, then went for a chicken tikka appetizier and some curry. \u00a0The food was amazing but be careful when they say the curry is hot, they mean it!!!! We wanted to split a Lassie at the very end and Raj was very happy to accommodate. \u00a0Overall and amazing experience and another reason why I will not eat British food when I'm in great Britain",

We looked it up on Yelp and decided to stick around the Central Line if possible. So glad we did!We easily got a table around 8pm on a rainy Monday night. The service was very attentive without being overbearing, but it's the food that will bring us back next time we visit London. The curries are complex and layered with flavor and each had a low, slow burn that built as we ate. The meat was so tender we had trouble keeping it on a fork. My wine was a generous pour, too.You can get tasty Indian food all over London for any amount of money you wish to spend, but this is the spot to get the real thing at a decent price. Go if you can.",

There was a table of six sitting and eating and NO ONE else. We should be taken the hint that it was lunch time and the place was empty. We ordered samosas and at the price of 5 pounds they were so not worth it. Two tiny little bites. The rest of the meal did not get better with tasteless dishes that were suppose yo be spicy. The waiter was friendly but out to make a buck. Tea five pounds, he was going to charge us another four pounds when I asked for chili sauce to flavor the food and ten minutes later( while my food got cold) he came out with a dish of sauce. I told him I didn't ask for that and he said,\" no charge \". Sixty pounds later we were still hungry and upset we even stepped into this place. So sad.",
