Although a dover sole I had there four years ago remains my favourite. I think the whole place is spot on, they really know what they are doing and don't mess around with it. A warning though, I still give this pace four stars because I really get a kick out of the average customer age being somewhere north of seventy.",

Bentley's is located on Swallow Street the small connecting street between Piccadilly and Regent Street, that seems to be ever more populated by decent bars and restaurants. A smart entrance leads straight onto the small but sophisticated bar. Attentive service at the bar ensured that the wine was consumed way too quickly. And on a hottish summers evening the choice of ros\u00e9s was tempting. The smattering of upmarket minor celebs also helped the overall atmosphere. Nice place to meet before dinner - and going by all the other reviews a pretty good place to have dinner as well!",

I ordered a Loire Valley white wine which went with my scallops pretty well. The scallops were delicious. And of course I tried some oysters as starters which were also good. The downside is awkwardly small reception area and for some reason they charge a $2/ person cover charge. Note that i in a country where tipping is not a norm, the restaurant includes a 12.5% service charge in the bill.",

    "text": "Being a fish connoisseur there is a special place in Mayfair for special occasions. Bentley's Oyster Bar and Grill is tucked away in Swallow Street, not far off from Piccadilly. Reservations are highly recommended. There are two parts, the restaurant upstairs, which I find rather boring and stiff as well as the Oyster Bar & Grill downstairs. Entering the restaurant, there is a entr\u00e9e, where wine and drinks are served, it is a good place to wait in case some guests are late. Being ushered to our tables at the bar, we were unfortunate enough that we ladies were placed near the door. After speaking to the maitre di, he generously allowed us to sit at a more comfortable spot.Their menu is excellent, but what I was looking forward all day long are the oysters. We ordered 2 different species. One of them seamed to be fresher then the other.When I am invited to a restaurant such as this, I never go for the most expensive menu, even though it always happens to be my favourite. However, my dish partner order the lobster. All night long I was gazing over at his plate. The waiters where very attentive and their multilingual entertainment amused our whole table. The dinner was excellent and the portions were generous. Even though the prices are rather the top end of London, this place is not over stylish, but is true in its origin - seafood! ...And they have a high quality in service and atmosphere. This place is good for business lunches or a dinner in a smaller circle of dear friends.",

    "text": "This place is great. Fantastically old school, but in a modern and stylish way. We sat at the Oyster bar, watching the guys crack open and turn over the oysters one after the other for hours - very therapeutic. After a glass of pink bubbly, I tucked into a fish pie, with spinach on the side. And oh my god, this fish pie. It is quite possibly the best fish pie I've ever tasted. It arrived and I thought I would only be able to finish half of it, but the sauce was so delicate and the fish so perfectly cooked, I finished the lot! Amazing crunchy mash on the top, not too heavy or salty, the fish melts in your mouth, it was incredible. This is the kind of place to go for a special occasion or if you just love seafood and happen to be shopping in the area \u00a0it is after all right near Piccadilly and Regents Street, so a great place to stop off and recharge! And if you're looking for a fish pie to beat all fish pies, this is your place! Good tip \u00a0eating at the bar is a lot cheaper than in the restaurant which is pricey. The fish pie was around \u00a310 cheaper at the bar because it didn't have lobster in it, which the restaurant one does Oh and lovely old school powder room toilets for the ladies (I'm not sure about the men's!)",

She ordered a lobster, which was pretty small like the size of a large shrimp and bland tasting. \u00a0I had a mix of a dozen oysters, which were fresh, but the selection of oysters were okay, nothing to rave about. \u00a0The oysters at Bentley's can't compare to the Kumamoto, Blue Point, Chesapeake, and Irish Rock oysters. \u00a0I generally like to enjoy eating my oysters a few different ways, either as is, with a little bit of fresh black pepper and lemon, or some horse radish and cocktail sauce. \u00a0When I asked for the cocktail sauce, the bartender behind the oyster bar made it from scratch, but it turned out to be something like a ketchup/mayo mix, which tasted horrible. \u00a0The bartender then chastised me for putting the \"homemade\" cocktail sauce on a couple of my oysters, telling me the only way to eat it is plain, without sauce or vinegar. \u00a0I do eat my oysters plain, but just smiled and nodded my head. \u00a0Luckily he insisted I try it his way and gave me a few extra for me and my girlfriend to try, which I happily obliged.The interior was nice, menu seemed well put together, but for the hefty price the place just didn't blow me away. \u00a0And the pretentiousness of the place almost made me give it 2 stars, the only save was the few extra oysters thrown in. \u00a0Decent meal, but way too expensive for what it's worth.",

    "text": "Owned by Richard Corrigan, who owns the fantastic Lindsay House, this place is a bit of a let down. I was expecting far more from the food and definitely from the service. The chorizo stuffed squid starter was a winner. The fish pie main dish, dull. Now I guess the fish pie might seem a boring choice, but it takes a god chef to make a good fish pie, it ain't as simple as it appears. Anyway, it was a bit weak. I've had much better.  The selction of fresh fish, cooked in any manner you choose would probably be a better choice in a venue like this, and did get the thumbs up from my dining companions. Now for dessert. Yes, I chose the traditional option again, decided to play it safe and went for my favourite: the chocolate pudding. Now I know my chocolate puddings and this wasn't at all good. It was dry, not a hint of that steamed moistness you expect from a pudding, and didn't taste particularly chocolately. The accompanying custard was on the cold side of warm. Either give it me cold or make sure it's piping, not 'left on the side for 10 minutes' temperature', not when I'm payingf \u00a3100 plus a-head. I did taste a friend's apple tart, which was delightful, maybe I just chose the wrong thing. Two particularly sour points about the evening: one of my dining companions was given the wrong dessert. The waitress merely shrugged and said if she wanted her original choice she would have to wait another 20 minutes. There was no apology. Another friend was a vegetarian. And I know it was a fish restaurant but he didn't pick the venue, seriously, how hard can it be to have somethign other than goats' cheese (which he is allergic to) on your menu. We even phoned ahead to let them know and they said not to worry at all. Upon telling this to the waiter when placing our order, he was far from impressed and merely moved on to the next person ordering without uttering a word. Anyway, a vegetarian dish did arrive. Guess what it was? A bowl of pasta with cheese, brilliant. And it was overcooked. Has a privaye room that sits about 14 too. The lady at the cloakroom is a little gem. The best thing about this place.",

Go for a drink. \u00a0Enjoy an oyster. Leave somewhere else for a special dinner.",

    "text": "We went here for dinner last night. I'd never heard of it before but it seems to be quite famous. Its famous as a fish restaurant, so in some ways it was unfortunate we had at least two fussy eaters in our group, and out of six diners four had rib eye steaks. The steaks did go down well though, and the starters for the fussy eaters (smoked salmon for one and goats cheese salad for the other, if I remember correctly) also ended up as clean plates. We had a couple of pre-starters with our drinks, which is always a nice touch. One involved beetroot and I think goats cheese, the other was a number of small fried cheese things to share. I had squid stuffed with chorizo and feta to start and halibut with sauce nero and vegetables for main. Both were very nice. Then tarte tatin with calvados ice cream for dessert. Again, nice. But all of it was just that, very nice, not blow my head amazing, which is why it only gets four stars.",

A single waiter was available to serve approximately 20 people and as you would imagine, the service was atrocious. My wife had a lobster bisque that was as thin as dishwater! Although the night was early, the Seabass was no longer available and the salmon that I had was quite boring. The prices were exorbitant and this was the first restaurant that I had experienced in London that had a charge of 3 pounds per person for a seat. When I challenge this charge, the manager did waive it. Fortunately, this was my last night in London and this was by far and away the only bad meal that I experienced. As such, my memories of this trip will generally be very positive but I will advise people to never patronize this tourist trap.",

Service to match.Wonderful bread on the table. Some of the sourest sourdough I have tasted. All our starters were great. crab that was still nipping. Oysters alive and well as they slid down the gullet. Mains served with skill. My Turbot (to share) expertly dissected in front of us. Accompanying hollandaise beautifully viscose. Lots of lovely wine to choose from and some decent puddings which didn't seem like an afterthought.This place feels special and a real treat. You pay for it but nothing more than you'd expect for a top quality London afternoon out. A great British treat in the heart of London.",

Said boyfriend is so into seafood that I wouldn't be surprised if a blood test showed him to be more fish than man and with Bentley's being renowned for this delicious speciality we both had very high hopes. Unfortunately, not all of these were fulfilled. I have to say, the staff were lovely, a bit stiff for my liking but very well informed and friendly. After grabbing a quick cocktail downstairs (a couple of boozy, boozy Caprihina's) we were swept into the more formal dining room. Full of suits with a very stiff atmosphere, it was not the easiest place to relax in but fortunately we had a nice corner table away from the room a bit. Being on a set menu, our choices were limited to just two options. For starters a prawn cocktail and salmon mouse and for mains pea and bacon broth with cod and a fish stew. Whilst both the prawn cocktail and cod were delicious, the others fairly forgettable. In fact, the fish stew was more of a curry, very dry and although tasty, padded out with chickpeas. I would definitely give Bentley's another go as I don't think our menu was a very fair representation of the place. However, next time I go, I think I'll try and get a good group together to give that dining room an injection of personality.",

We got the tuna and the scallop ceviche, and they were both fresh and flavorful. For our entrees we got the baked seafood dish and the fish and chips. The fish in the fish and chips was not bad; it was tender and the batter was pretty good. On the other hand, the potato mash it came with was a bit sour and didn't seem to go particularly well with the rest of the dish. The chips were okay but nothing special. As for the baked seafood dish, I was pretty underwhelmed. The presentation was quite nice, but it was really just a few pieces of seafood with tomato paste on top, and that's what it tasted like.

Sure but out of a great sounding squid (still on the board) so went with the grilled octopus- more artsy fartsy than substance but beautifully done with the almond aioli, JulieD chose the wild duck with foie gras salad- fantastic paring with the mandryn orange. Loved it. For mains I'm sticking with specials and a monk fish and prawn patato curry and she opted for the smoked haddock. Wine paring was a Loire chenin blanc for the lady and a cote de rhone for me.Patio was warm under heat and this side side street has walking traffic fun without too much noise from the high street. AS a single, I've sat at the bar for dinner and prefer it to inside tables that can get cramped. The evening was enjoyable and fit for foodies but the service never made the mark. For these prices, I expect top notch. And please remove or remark specials that are no longer available. I get all excited for not.",

They did not tell us until 10 minutes after ordering. While they did offer free dessert for the mistake, it was offered at 6:58 when we had told them we needed to leave at 7:00.

I'm sure you'll hear about it. Oh yes, I'm writing a review. Owned my by a Michelin star chef, not a Michelin star restaurant. Although my meal was better here than the one Michelin star restaurant I have visited. Started ceps tart. Amazing, buttery, flaky, earthy, huge for a starter. Ate every last morsel. His starter was supposedly nice as well but it contained meat so sadly I had to pass. Sea bass, perfectly cooked served over some apple relish salady sort of something. Deep fried chili courgettes, yummmmm. Buttered spinach, lovely. Malbec, 2 bottles. Found out there was a Cinnabon near by, after my 3+ year mission for a cinnabon, decided to have that for dessert. That was disappointing so then we headed to Haagen Dazs. How the hell are my clothes still fitting??We ate upstairs and this portion of the restaurant is very fancy or like they say here, posh. Apparently there is an oyster bar and grill downstairs that is supposed to be less stuffy. It's in the center of London and it is expensive. This little Puerto Rican woman is beyond BLESSED to get so spoiled! I'd take off a half star if I could because service left a lot to be desired. Server could not recall the specials, kept pulling out her notes and still flubbing. Not ok for this type of place. However the food was very very good- Enjoy!",

We were charged a cover charge and a 10% gratuity. \u00a0For that much, service better be stellar. \u00a0We will not be returning.",

Each offers a different menu and you may not order off of the other.Our hotel called ahead for us and made a reservation. We we seated upstairs in their very nice dining room. \u00a0We were hoping to order fish and chips, but noticed the menu did not offer that. We asked our server who explained that is only available downstairs. Unfortunately, they did not have room at that time to accommodate us downstairs so we opted to stay. The bread basket with butter is amazing. For our meals we had the Royal fish pie and Dover sole - both outstanding.The next day we returned for lunch - downstairs - and had the Fish and Chips. AMAZING. I would return just for this dish. Both dining experiences were good, but I would only return downstairs.",

An exception to the \"boring\" qualifier applies to the oyster appetisers: in addition to the raw ones, they also serve innovative cooked oyster dishes (like Catalan, Vietnamese); I tried the Catalan trio - very tasty. The fish stew would make any bouillabaisse lover happy, even without cheese and rouille. The seaweed butter is fragrantly delicious, and compensated for the mediocre bread. Helpful service, including the good practice of giving out the price of more expensive sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s du jour. The one Michelin star is well deserved.",

There are two indoor bars for seating which we preferred to the covered outdoor setting on a windy evening. A pianist played in what would be a very small hallway connecting the bars, the only strange thing about the restaurant. The menu is extensively seafood, although I did see a couple order steaks, the stars of the show come from the ocean. I enjoyed a selection of three types of fresh oysters to start, although they have many dressed options available. The quality and presentation was perfect. Next up came the lobster bisque and fried calamari. Both were executed flawlessly. A great seasoning on the squid and dipping sauce was well made. The lobster bisque didn't actually contain any chunks of lobster, which would have really sealed the deal, however, you could still taste the flavour and a hint of spice in the creamy broth.For mains we enjoyed the fish pie and linguine vongole. The fish pie was a large portion and very hearty. There were three types of fish and it was your classic dish. The linguine was lacking some depth. All the ingredients were there - fresh pasta, clams, tomatoes and herbs. I could have used cheese, white wine and chillies. Service was excellent, save for the wrong beer served, which was corrected as soon as we brought it to their attention. Overall, an excellent place for any seafood lover.",

    "text": "Ok, so my expectations were very high with this restaurant. Everyone recommended the place. We went and maybe we just expected more than was reasonable. The restaurant is pretty, the outside area is very nice but it was a little chilly so we elected to stay inside. The staff was very nice, but they did not tell us about the specials for the night and I think we would have ordered differently if they had. The bread and butter were great. I had the grilled octopus and Joe had the grilled prawns as appetizers. Both were very fresh and the ginger and lime on the prawns were very tasty. I had the 1/2 lobster grilled and Joe had the steak (yes, I know that ordering steak in a famous seafood restaurant is just asking for problems). \u00a0The lobster was good, not great, but good. Not a lot of it for the money but it was average. The steak was even more expensive and it was literally two medallion pieces that were tough and very small for the price. The meal was ok, certainly not what we expected and no way would we bother returning. Just too many other places to try",

    "text": "Bentleys is a place made for 5 star reviews! Simple as that really. Owner/operated by the esteemed Richard Corrigan this place is a celebration of all that it is to be an oyster bar.A friends birthday was a great excuse to pop in here a week weeks ago on a Saturday, to start we made out was in and were ushered to the beautiful bar area. A well made g&t in hand we took in the surroundings and discussed the lovely venue.Escorted to our table I took on ordering responsibilities, I have known Rach for more than 7 years now and with it being her birthday she was happy to trust me. Bottle of picpul, easy choice.Next, well this was an easy one really, the seashore sharing platter. Oysters, mussels, clams, whelks and crevettes served with a selection of bread and condiments. The star dressing had to be the tomato which i'm still not sure exactly what they do to, horseradish and red wine vinegar turn it into a taste sensation. With the oyster it was just remarkable. The platter was an amazing as you would expect and fair value at \u00a344.Desert....well for this we resorted to the specials menu. A cr\u00e8me brulet for 2, dressed with raspberries, white chocolate and flowers. Visually stunning. The snap on the sugar, the visible vanilla...it was just phenomenal. Great lunch, great service.....perfect afternoon.",

    "text": "Had a lunch here today as I missed another reservation I had made because a meeting ran late... It's located off a bustling street in Piccadilly and has a more casual downstairs and a more formal upstairs. I didn't realize this until the end of my meal, but if you have the choice, I'd opt for downstairs. I started out with incredible goug\u00e8res filled with oozing cheese. Their bread basket was filled with some wonderful homemade breads and nicely whet my appetite. Lobster bisque was fishy and watery. Such a disappointment and hard to swallow.Tomato soup on the other hand was comforting, smooth and savory with a lobster garnish. For the main, I ordered the brill and it was very fresh with a decent side of mashed potatoes. The atmosphere was formal and borderline stuffy.",
