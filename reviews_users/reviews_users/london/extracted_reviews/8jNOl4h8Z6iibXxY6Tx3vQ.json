Not only is the quality great but the price is very low too!I wouldn't go here for dinner, unless I was on the go, because it's cold and uncomfortable. However, it's great for lunch. It's effectively just a great quality fast food joint serving excellent pizza for next to nothing.Pro's: Quality pizza, quality coffee, friendly service, quick service, very cheap.Con's: Not good for a sit down dinner.",

I found the bases completely bland and was pretty disappointed with the stingey amount of toppings! I ordered a pizza with olives and artichokes and only got about 3 of each of them!I recommend you grab one of the oils to add to your pizza to give some more taste! The garlic one was delicious.I would probably come back here purely for the price, but not somewhere I was crazy about!",

Mozzarella cheese, tomato, olives, anchovies and a fried egg. DELICIOUS! It was \u00a34.50 or was it \u00a35.00. My boyfriend had the Hawaiian. He loved it too!The atmosphere is brilliant. It's busy, but not over crowded, and feel at ease to eat in there. Pizza is made fresh and when it's ready, you'll get buzzed to pick it up! One piece of advice, mind the hot plate when you pick it up!",

The only problem is knowing when to stop treating ICCO as your kitchen, lounge and mum all rolled into one!Good for morning coffee by the street, great for lunch before it gets too busy, and wonderful for take-out dinner when you're drinking at a pub nearby and need pizza with your patio/pavement beers.

At Last i went to counter to check my order when i found that my pizza was given to someone else. You have a very high tech system in place for your orders despite that how can one do this ? And even no apologies, was not a good experience",

Value is more than 3\u00a3 -- sometimes price isn't the only thing. I can see how it would have tremendous appeal for some but when your order gets messed up because the counter staff and you can't communicate over the loud music, well . . .",

You seemed nice but I had a boyfriend!), I pushed past the awkwardness and continued eating there every Friday when I moved to London as a student.I'm no longer a student, but I still eat there whenever I'm in the area. \u00a0The pizzas are cheap (though not as cheap as they used to be), but they're amazing! \u00a0I'm really picky about pizza, in that I will only eat thin crust pizza with a non-chunky, non-overwhelming sauce, and lots of delicious cheese, and this fits the bill perfectly. \u00a0It is deliciously greasy and floppy, and usually ready within 10 minutes, even if it's really busy, so there's not much waiting around before you can shovel it into your face. \u00a0I adore it, and I hope they don't change a thing. Well, if they had to change something, I'd love to see some shakers of parmesan and garlic salt, a la New York style pizza, but I can live without it. \u00a0Just keep the pizzas coming!",

Okay, a few, but with Starbucks etc strewn around the area, the real reason anyone comes here is for the cheap but delicious pizza's. Starting at around \u00c2\u00a33.50, you just give your order and wait amongst other spendthrifts and students and wait for you ticket to be called out. It's like a pizza lottery as you can never really hear what or who they're calling and so you may shuffle up to the counter more than once until it is actually yours. The pizza's are thin-based, have good amount of toppings and are quite large, certainly filling. And for the cheap cost it certainly better than most fast food.",

The four cheeses and special pizzas are particularly worth a mention for their use of fresh, tasty ingredients that may make you think twice about paying twice the amount elsewhere.",

The place looks a bit a crude and in a way gives you New York-ish feeling. It's self serviced. You order and pay at the counter, but instead of getting usual plastic number, you receive a strange device that starts to vibrate when your food is ready. Pretty high tech for such a low key place:) The pizza is OK, value for money I'd say (though the fresh basil on mine and the basil sauce on my boyfriend's were missing). Apart from pizza they have cheap salads, muffins and drinks. The toilet was the funny bit. You have to walk throughout their kitchen to get there, which can be nice as you can see the chefs at work, but when you realize they prepare your food next to the open toilets, it's less appealing.",

Prices start at \u00a33.95 for a margherita and our delicious 4 cheese pizza was \u00a35. If you're hungry, you'd probably want your own but for a late night snack, a pizza between the two of us did the trick. On the side, you can help yourself to garlic oil, chilli oil, oregano and chilli flakes. You order at the counter and after paying, you are given a little vibrating coaster. The order didn't take long at all, maybe 5 minutes? We picked up our pizza, decorated it with the extras and tucked in. We also saw loads of people getting pizzas for takeaway. \u00a0A testament to its popularity in the area! ICCo has been here for as long as I can remember and to see a restaurant like this survive in the presence of some bigger restaurants in Fitzrovia is good to see.A must if you're in the area and up for a quick, wallet-friendly bite to eat!",

It was not the best pizza I have ever had and I left feeling greasy. The chili sauce and chili flakes where a fight to get a hold of as there was only one bottle for the whole place. They had no Tabasco which I am pretty sure is a MUST for a pizza place! The chili oil was questionable if it was even chili oil as it just seemed like orange oil, which had no flavor. This would not be my first stop if I was hungry in the area but I may give this place one more go to redeem itself. If you just want something quick & cheap, go there but don't expect the best pizza in the world, but its not the worst either!",

This consisted of Sausage Meat, a Fried Egg, Tomato sauce but minus the cheese. As it was a pizza I was looking for, it was an easy choice for me to choose cheese as an extra.What a bloody pizza!I can't believe you get a whole pizza! I think it's something like a 11inch or 12inch pizza too! I didn't expect my little body to cram it all in but I did! None of that topping sliding off the base action here, just pure stringy cheese, and toppings galore! I'd never had an egg on my pizza prior to this, but I think it may just be a keeper! Sprinkle a few chilli flakes over the pizza for some added heat to that pizza, it's the bees knees, trust me!I will most definitely be back here, heck, I can see myself becoming a regular!",

There is also a great drink selection including freshly squeezed juices which are also very reasonably priced for the area. It is wise to pick the time that you go carefully as it is so speedy when quiet but can get very busy. ICCo for me is the perfect place for when you have out of towners visiting and you (and your wallet) are exhausted after a a day of sight seeing or shopping or both and need a refuel/pit stop. This is a very specific need I know but one which for me often arises, and the many people who eat there attest to how great it is for more general eating needs!",

I can see why it would do well so close to UCL as the students probably love it. Second, the pizzas are HUGE. I was shocked to see how big they were considering the price.I blasphemed and ordered the Hawaiian pizza. It was one of the more expensive pizzas they have (coming in at a whole \u00a36 for dining in), and it was quite reminiscent of home. While many people don't like fruit on pizzas, I'm a fan. The pizza wasn't super decked out with toppings, but given the crust is quite thin, I think there's a good proportion of toppings to crust ratio (which you always want) and there wasn't too much cheese to drop off the crust.It wasn't the best pizza I've ever eaten, but it's definitely better than some of the imported American chains (I'm talking about you Pizza Hut, Domino's and Papa John's). If I'm feeling particularly hungry, I'll be back, or maybe next time I should just be good and order a salad.",

    "text": "This is so reminiscent of the motherland (NY/NJ), it's insane. Very good value pizza, starting from \u00a33.50 and super quick. The pizza is cooked fresh though and comes out steaming hot and greasy. The place itself is quite basic, reminds me of the pizzerias back home but with more seating (and definitely busier!). You order up front and they give you a plastic gadget that buzzes when your food is ready to collect. Very similar to restaurants in America where they give those to you when your table is ready to be seated.I've been here at least a few times since I discovered it, and with lots of different toppings. It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but one of the best in London for the price and closeness to my uni. It probably could be a little less greasy with crispier crust (they tend to be a bit floppy!), but for the price I love it. Very similar quality to Pizza Express without the ridiculous price tag. My friend and I have definitely been the envy of our office though the few times we've cheekily nipped here for lunch :)",

    "text": "First and foremost - really good pizza. One size pizza but it's average to large size. Wide choice of toppings with the traditional dishes - Hawaiian, four cheeses, pepperoni - as well as more elaborate concoctions. Extra toppings aren't too expensive. Wide choice of condiments: garlic and chilli oil, chilli flakes, oregano. Secondly - incredibly cheap. Pizzas starts from \u00a33 and rarely go above \u00a36. Sauces - garlic and herb, BBQ - cost about 50p. Condiments are free. Thirdly - great atmosphere. Popular with students but not in a bad way. The place is usually busy but it keeps the atmosphere alive and fresh. Even better when an Italian football game is on Loyalty cards are also available: half price pizza at 5 stamps, free pizza at 10 stamps. Watch out for expiration dates though. Star knocked off due to pizza being a bit greasy. But most people wouldn't care.",

I went on a rainy day and it was packed with locals just stopping by for a quick bite. I had a pepperoni pizza which was 4.50 pounds, and thats a great deal considering a lot of other dining options are far pricier. The pizza is relatively quick and I like that they hand make it on the spot so you know its fresh. The pizza is thin, the crust is perfect, and they stick to the basics. Thumbs up!If you want to see my pizza, you can catch my video blog about it here:youtu.be/N-6lyyYB0Pg",

    "text": "For cheap pizza and a game called find the chilli flakes, this place is hard to top, particularly based on the area.When you arrive you feel transported back 2 decades or more. It's a diner, but not deliberately made to look all hipster dated or chic. It just is. The place is generally clean, and there are plenty of tables to grab. Everything here is first come first served, so if you want that table, take it. Need some chilli sauce and there's none left at the cutlery area? Take it (after asking nicely of course) from somebody else's table. I have a feeling people resort to hiding it as to not lose what is like the ring from LOTR. Thus the game of find the chilli flakes/oil that people refer to.You order at the food area, and they even do just straight up milk, which surprised me, but as I know, milk tastes best with pizza, so I ordered that with my ham and olives.You get given a buzzer which goes off within 5 minutes or so, and you're eating. The pizza wasn't the best I've had, but it was big and the chilli flakes were a great addition. The problem is with pizza this cheap, they're going to skimp a little on the ingredients which was evident from the 6 olives on the pizza with none in the middle zone. Even cutting them in half and spreading around a bit would have been nicer personally. But I'm complaining about a pizza that cost \u00a36.50. It's indecent but I just thought I should mention it.Some of the meat is halal certified too, so double check if this is a requirement for you.",

The vegan pizza had very few toppings, and the vegan cheese was only present in about four small clumps. They are large pizzas, which is a plus, and I guess one must appreciate the fact that they at least tried to do a vegan option. The other pizzas looked much better so don't judge it just on this review, unless you're a fellow vegan.",

    "text": "I think this is my favourite pizza place in London. 1. It's cheap. Not insultingly \"is this real cheese\" cheap, just cheap enough that I was happy coming here several times a week for lunch (\u00a35-10 a pizza). I put a lot of weight on. 2. They make it fresh which is nice, takes about 10 minutes, maybe 15-20 if they're super busy (which isn't that unusual) but you can call it in if you're time poor. 3. It's REALLY GOOD. I can't stress this enough. It's really really good. Admittedly I had the same pizza pretty much every time (past tense as it's no longer geographically feasible to get there in a lunch break, otherwise it would be present tense, damn laws of physics...)4. It's ridiculously chill. In a manic way. Big metal tables with metal stools. Little metal tables with metal chairs if you want... Romance? The toilet is downstairs and through a weird purgatory style store room. This is somewhere you come to eat good pizza and hang out. It's not the latest and greatest. It's a golden oldie. Here there be no hipsters. So go here. I would say it's worth the 15 minute walk from Oxford street. You could get a frozen yogurt after from over the road. That's always a treat. Did I mention I put on weight?",

    "text": "Always a bit of a puzzle for me. I know that objectively ICCos isn't the best pizza around but it's always immensely satisfying, and the sort of place I find myself craving, even if I'm not quite sure why.Ambiance:There's something incredibly inviting about it. Interior is pretty bare. Some low (normal height) tables around the edges, while the middle is dominated by long counters with stools. Doesn't sound special and it's not but there's always a good level of crowd. Even if it's packed, you can usually find a seat, and it just feels warm and cozy.Prices:Since I started going in 09, there was one generic price increase, and one further change where they started charging 50p to eat in. That being said, it's still fairly cheap pizza. I think it's 4.50 for a margerita, and 6.30 for a capriciosa. I could also be completely off with these figures but I think that's about right.Pizza:Nice slightly chewy dough. They tend to scrimp a bit on toppings but still awesome. I tend to add either garlic/chilli oil depending on my mood.Others:Idk why but I always get a snapple when I'm here. It just fits. They now also sell dipping sauces (probably around 2 years ago but it still feels recent somehow), so I tend to get a garlic and herb sauce for the crust.Bottom line:Not sure I'd trek to check it out, but if you're in the area, I don't think you can find a more satisfying pizza.",

I got the vegan cheese pizza and at first I thought they had accidentally given me dairy cheese because usually you can tell the difference between the two just by looking and my pizza looked and tasted exactly like it had dairy cheese (although it for sure was vegan).We have a different brand of vegan cheese that is popular here in North America, and don't get me wrong, it's still delicious and I get pizzas with it all the time, but it almost tastes like a hybrid between mozzarella cheese and alfredo sauce, whereas the kind they use in London tasted exactly like a blend of mozzarella and cheddar. SO GOOD. After tasting one bite of that vegan cheese pizza I devoured the whole thing to myself and I'm not sure why everyone doesn't order the dairy free cheese when they go there - same taste but absolutely no bloating haha! 10/10!",

Take away options are slightly cheaper, and the stuff members are nice enough not to kick you out when you are eating take-away on the premises. They are also quite nice about us bringing our beers, but to be fair we did get told off in the end. However the experience of going to the toilet make your pink glasses slightly drop down. To get to the toilets you need to go through the kitchen/food storage/dish washing area and it slightly reveals the backstage process of how the pizza was made, and might give slight concerns of how well the ingredients are stored etc. It would have been so much better if I haven't seen these areas.",

Although the pricing caused just as many dilemmas because it was great. Do I go for a bigger pizza because I'm not that hungry but for that price.......Self service with friendly staff with sufficient seating on a clean and tidy environment. \u00a0Loads of customers \u00a0already seated and clearly enjoying themselves. Salami pizza was great and very tasty with a \u00a0perfect base.",

The area is really open and you order at the counter and also pick up from the counter. Seating is on metal chairs and tables and I think a lot of people order and take-away. We tried the four cheese pizza and vegan pizza- also big props for doing a Vegan pizza! yeaaahahhhhahahha. Both were very good They have thin crusts and are mostly crispy. I think next time I'd really like to try a plain margherita just to judge how it is compared to others. This place gets 5 stars because they make really big, thin, and delicious pizzas for an incredible price. It's not exactly the best pizza I've ever had, but it's still pretty darn good.",

Grab it and keep ahold of it! I've had them stolen while I've gone to get my pizza before (I've had my entire place taken!).The pizza you get will be hot, thin, crispy and flavourful. I love the garlic oil here and covering the pizza with oregano and chili flakes, but getting takeout and not being able to do this is just as good.Don't normally grab a drink, this is a place to grab a quick bite before heading somewhere else.

Whilst it's nothing really to look at, I love functionality of the place, it's very American Diner in style, tall tables and stools in the middle, with shorter tables at the windows, although the colours are definitely Italian, Green, white and red.I also love the fact that they have so many oils and herbs for you to add, it's nice to have the choice and be able to customise. \u00a0The Greek salad is also okay, and is also cheap, at \u00a32.5 I believe.I've not tried the deserts - the pizza is such a good portion that I didn't really need to, but at less than \u00a33, they're also reasonable.It's not particularly a romantic date venue, but a great place to go for a quick bite, fast food at it's prime! I love coming here with friends before going for a drink, and sometimes pop in for a cheeky express lunch.",

I ordered a Pepperoni Pie and it was a fair price at 5.95 pounds or nearly 10 American dollars so kind of expensive even. The pie, of course, was a personal size pie - i.e. small. I found the pie to lack flavor. There was a light sprinkling of cheese topped with some pepperoni. The girl cutting the pies into slices did a poor job and none of my slices were cut all the way through. It is not that hard of a job to cut a pizza pie. So as I ate my pie I had to rip it apart which was not a pleasant experience. I am not sure how any Yelper of gave more than three stars here. I can buy a large pie in Manhattan, NY for 8 dollars or about 4 pounds; now that's a deal! I am pretty sure I will not come back to this place. At least they gave me a receipt; probably because I had to pick up my food down the counter further.London people please expect more and do not accept mediocre. You are NOT getting good deals just because a restaurant says so.",

Ok your exterior red, green and white facade may be a little tacky and yes there is always a queue of people trying to get their pizza before me but oh you make it worth it when my number is called and my delicious is pizza presented to me! Icco's is incredible value and prices start at \u00a33.50 for their pizza's. My boyfriend and I have been known to share one of these on the days we've felt especially skint and it's fed us both very easily. Icco's is an especially popular option because so many of the restaurants near by are mediocre and overpriced. This place with all of it's hustle and bussle has twice as much atmosphere as them all put together and prices that would make their owners weep. A must try if you're ever in the area!",

    "text": "I won't lie to you - this is not the best Pizza you will ever have in London, or indeed in your life (hopefully). What this is, is a place that serves up Pizza to order, quickly and cheaply. I've never spent more than \u00a35. There's a great sense of satisfaction meandering back down Charlotte St with my ICCO pizza in hand smirking at the people in Pizza Express who've just paid a lot more for a pizza of similar quality. Maybe that's a bit mean.... The service is without frills, and you can eat in on large stainless steel communal tables if you like. A buzzer system alerts you to when your pizza is ready. Lovely, cheap and tasty carbs. I love it!",

They also have some nice salads and cakes, though a pizza can be filling enough.This place isn't posh, but it is a great place to get a quick and tasty bite to eat in central London.",

Being in the middle of Central London, my hopes for having a pizza that wasn't sodden in plastic, greasy cheese weren't that high but I decided to go with it. I'm so glad I did - this \u00a33.50 10'' pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever tasted in the London! Definitely try it with the garlic & herb dip as an absolute must. Cooked fresh, served piping hot and with a smile - this is definitely one of my new favourites.",

I like to mix it up and get some of the pizzas with loads of toppings and they are never wet in the middle and so just are soggy. One pizza is more than I can handle so when buying lunch for the guys, I get about 5 pizzas for 6 - 7 people. Excellent value for money!",

    "text": "OK, I will be judging this place on the merits of their anchovy pizza. Listed on the board as the Neptune, this pizza is alright. I won't be raving about it, but good grub for a fiver. Sometimes that's just what you need. The anchovies were not on every slice, big mistake. Uncool Italian Coffee Company that makes pizza. Ok, so there might've been alarm bells on that one. But legitimately, ICco is the only place I've found here that comes close to serving pizza at a reasonable price. Kinda reminds me of places in NY where you can get a slice, but you get a full plate of pizza. Pizza Express, come on. I'm just not going down that pretentious road. But here, for five pounds you get a decent sized meal. No frills, just that. College/university students swoon, I warn that all others might not. Enjoyable nonetheless.",

It is in Fitzrovia and as one might expect the clientele is mixed, but with quite a few students and ad execs. The pizzas are displayed on a board at the front, and whilst there are also salads these aren't really worth bothering with. The pizzas are in in the thin based Italian style and really tasty as well as being really cheap. The coffee is also pretty good. There is seating inside and out. It can get a little noisy inside so if its not too cold or rainy outside is better.A great place, the sort London could do more with.",

A welcome step from previously having to strain your ears, listening out for your name to be called, which usually sounded nothing like it's supposed to be.Pizza's are \u00a33-\u00a35. 11\", thin base, decent variety of toppings, freshly made, not circular.It can get ridiculously busy during lunch time, especially in the summer and it's not the kind of place you'd want to keep sitting in.
