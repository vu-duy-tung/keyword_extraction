I don't know what it was, but it didn't make me jump up and scream 'Yes! I've just eaten one of my favourite dishes in the world!' more like 'Eh...well, I just had my favourite dish done in a very mediocre way.' Also tried a Thai Fish cake that had the texture of a piece of egg from McDonalds. You know, squishy egg-but-notreally-egg texture on your Egg McMuffin. Think that. But it's supposed to be fish. Mmmm....Right.My friends enjoyed their Pad Thai and another spicy noodle dish but I just wasn't all that impressed. Maybe in a pinch, maybe actually dining in but not a go-to take out place.",

    "text": "Grilled calamari and thai peanut salad as starters, delicious. Tamarind duck main with coconut rice was very nice. The sauce was sweet and the crunchy topping was a great touch. The duck is served on top of pok choi (I think) and that was a good complement, \u00a0adding some crisp veg flavor. My dinner companion had a jungle curry with chicken - he found out a little runnier/more watery than he would have liked. So the food was good. The ambience much better than anticipated. But the service left something to be desired. They messed up our bill. \u00a0So 3 stars. This part is more about our annoying experience with some rude patrons, so read for your own amusement of you like ... We had a booking. \u00a0A couple of rude Scandinavian guys sat down after us, at the table behind us, without a booking. We ordered our drinks, starters, and mains. Then before the server could take our orders to the kitchen, the guys behind us demanded that they place their order before she run off. Unfortunately the poor server felt compelled to do so. Then the rude guys sat there having a long dialogue with the server about every detail of every item on the menu for about ten minutes. Delaying our food. The server was not bold enough to say something to the guys and get away. After she left I said something to them however. \u00a0They said they were just SO HUNGRY they couldn't wait (implying our hunger could wait, though)...and they said it was because \u00a0there was only one server. This was not true. There were at least three walking around! Maybe these guys couldn't tell them apart (though actually one was a man)?? Hey fellow diners...Don't be jerks!!",

    "text": "It was a hard choice between pad kee mau with duck (my usual favourite) or the deliciously described deep-fried sea bass with spicy thai dressing. I went the deep-fried sea bass with spicy thai dressing and was a happier woman for it. The starter was a simple but tasty grilled squid. The dipping sauce was the star of the dish with hints of lemon, garlic, finely chopped chilli, and some other magic. My friend had penang curry with duck which tasted pretty good but not spectacular. I think the sea-bass dishes are the distinguishing dishes at Monkey & Me. A couple of other tables ordered sea-bass dishes (steamed and fried).The restaurant is on the contemporary-modern side of decor; good for enjoying a nice dinner but not comfortable enough to stick around too long after dessert. The servers were friendly and nice. Verdict: Not a place to trek across town for but if you're in the area, it's a good Thai restaurant. Since I live down the street, I asked for a take-out menu and a business card. I'm considering becoming a regular.",

On recommendation from a friend who works nearby, I went to Monkey and Me for dinner at around 7pm on a Tuesday evening. There's another Thai restaurant just a few doors down but she said this was the better one \u00a0and though I haven't been to the other one, I can't argue!Service: Thai staff. Friendly, attentive & efficient. Drinks arrived within 2 minutes of ordering. Starters within 5 minutes and mains at a nice 5 minute interval after the starters. Can't be faulted.Atmosphere: Really lovely. Some easy-listening back ground music, nice decor & lighting. Though I chose to sit outside where they had a couple of tables. So nice to watch the world go by while the sun was setting.A fair few of the tables were reserved already (slightly surprising for a Tuesday evening!) and the one side of the restaurant was just about full. But not noisy at all.Food: presentation was lovely and just looked so yummy. Ingredients clearly high quality. Everything super fresh and piping hot. Taste \u00a0just perfect to me. Full of flavour and nothing over-powering despite the fish cakes being spicy. Portions are more than generous!Value for money: Good. Starter of fish cakes, large portion of Thai crackers, sparkling water, gin & tonic, steamed rice and Massaman curry all came to \u00a322 inclusive or service.Would I recommend and go back? YES!",

Actual bits of coconut was contained in rice. Thai curry was relatively creamy and mild. They did not use too much nampula- which tells me that was seasoned carefully = no cheating.

The food was good, decent Thai, not flippin fantastic, but fairly functional if you're looking for Thai fair. The decor is actually really sleek, it looks really expensive from the outside and the menus are WELL designed. Someone really went to taking great care on making sure this place is cosy. The food was a little slow in leaving the kitchen and lukewarm by the time it hit the table. Mine was a little more greasy than I'd expect from a place decorated this nicely. Granted, I paid \u00a36.95 for the Pad Kee Mao, for a place that looked like it'd charge me \u00a39.95 for it. Anyway, as another reviewer described, it's nothing to write home about nor to complain about. Just a little mismatch from expectations from the decor, the price and the quality of food. Would I come back? Probably, if I was in the area (which I don't actually live very far), but there are plenty of 3.5* Thai places inbetween where I live and Marylebone.",

It's not the best Thai food I've ever tasted, but they the standard dishes are quite tasty--curries and stir fries are usually a good option. Anything slightly off-piste can be somewhat hit or miss. The staff are just okay. They can be quite short, even rude at times. And there is one thing I find particularly strange. Table setting include very nice wine glasses. However, when you order wine, they take away the nice glassware and provide you with thick rimmed, stout, pub-like wine glasses. We usually request to keep the nice glassware and they always let us do this, but I do feel that we get the evil eye for asking. The restaurant has recently been redesigned--loads of clean lines and pseudo-modern furniture which isn't that comfortable. But I guess when you're out for lunch from work, you don't want to get overly comfortable; you may never make it back.",

So when I find a spot that's a bit tucked away, offers comfortable table service, isn't jam packed to the gills AND has a lunch special!? Well, I'm pretty happy. Set lunch: starter (or soup) + main for \u00a310.95. Or, you can do appetizer + soup + main for just a few quid more. The best part of this is that it flies out of the kitchen. Easy in and out in an hour for lunch breakers!My selections were the Tom Kha mushroom soup + Cashew Chicken stir-fry. Both were quite good and I was impressed with the portion size for the main given it was a lunch deal. Very filling. the Tom Kha was good, though I'd likely opt to add in chicken or something a bit more substantial, a bunch of bobbing mushrooms isn't terribly appealing or filling as it turns out. Though I do love that coconut! Service was just fine. No complaints. Quick and efficient. Will most definitely be back when craving some Thai and needing a respite from the office drones and chains of Baker Street.",

Then my friend had a tofu curry with some rice and I chose an amazing soup. Fortunately this is a written review so you won't have to suffer through my horrible pronunciation of Guay Tiew Neua, which is the name of said beef noodle soup. Slightly spicy, very flavourful, LOTS of meat, maybe not enough greens. Good broth (I love a good broth!), okay noodles. Cost us about \u00a315 each with non alcoholic drinks (Tea and a big bottle of sparkling water - look at us being healthy!). Most dishes are between \u00a38 and \u00a311. Sides around \u00a33.",

We ended up ordering the panang curry with veggies and the stir fry thai basil with veggies. The thai basil stir fry was ordered extra spicy. Unfortunately, that dish was a miss - so bland, no flavor. It tasted just like regular brown sauce. When we informed the waitress, she was very willing to make a different dish. We ended up getting the chili stir fry, which was definitely better, but still not amazingly flavorful. Also, it wasn't made extra spicy as requested, but we didn't really want to have them remake it, so we just got chili powder on the side.The mixed veggies were a good variety - bell peppers, baby corn, broccoli, bamboo, onion, carrot, string beans, mushrooms, zucchini.They were so nice about everything and kept checking in to make sure the experience was good, so that's a huge plus. But the taste just wasn't there. I wish the food was more flavorful. It's possible if I were in the area I would try it again only for the service and just hope that the food was better, but otherwise, it's not the best.",

However I didn't find any particularly inviting starter.The service is usually pretty fast and friendly.I'd suggest to book a table for dinner since they're always pretty full, but if you're max 4 people you can usually find a free table even without reservation.",

    "text": "A very good option for a working lunch in the Baker St/ Marylebone area, they have a set menu which I think (if my memory serves me right) is about 10.95 for 2 courses. Lovely starters - prawn toast a personal fave. Like 90% of all people, I had the pad thai for mains (which I've had a few times here before) and it was lovely. Big portion though, couldn't finish it. It's quite busy on Thursday and Friday lunchtimes, so call ahead and book if you can. Tip - do not get the \"thai iced tea\". You'll be thinking, \" yay, I'm getting a lovely clear teabag stewed, icey refreshing drink.\" What you'll actually get is a revolting orangutan orange sweet milky monstrosity of doom. Avoid at all costs. Sans the aforementioned drink, you'll be safe as houses, because Monkey & Me is really pretty darn good overall.",
