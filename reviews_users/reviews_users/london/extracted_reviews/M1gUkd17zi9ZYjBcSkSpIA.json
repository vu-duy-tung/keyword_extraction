    "text": "Went for lunch as a party of 6. They took a deposit from my card on booking, but as I am not known there & they are evidently full every day I think it fair. Easy to find, and a nice welcome with a pleasant sit & gather area, where we were offered excellent nibbles. It was immediately apparent that this is a first class place where everyone is proud to work there and dedicated to being the best. They carry on Albert's dedication. I checked the wine list and could have chosen reasonably priced(considering where you are) from the nearly all French list. Downstairs indeed to a smart and comfortable room with nicely spaced tables. We had chosen the 'set' lunch, which is excellent value, and plenty of choices with wine included and good ones to boot. We started at 1 and left at 4.15, no hurry.I won't go into the detail as other reviewers correctly describe the food as excellent, and I have to agree that I really enjoyed my choices.Service was a pleasure. I simply have to ask why I have not been before. We are spoiled for choice in London at this level though, so I'll just have to ration myself.Do go for a first class Traditional Haut Cousine experience.",

    "text": "I had my birthday meal there with my parents and oh my gosh what an epic feast we had! We opted for the tasting menu and it was wine matched and I have never felt so drunk from eating out in my whole life but it was worth it. Here is what I had and I can say that this has to be one of the most memorable meals I have ever experienced. It is worth visiting at least once in your life, but come starving and don't expect to leave early or be able to move after wards for that matter! Our Amuse Bouche consisted of a Foie Gras Mousse and the tartlet thing which definitely had a bit of blue cheese in and has an airdried ham rose thing on top. I drank this with a Kir Royale. The first course was some Foie Gras that had a gingerbread crust around the outside and some pickled walnuts and cherries. This was matched with a Sauternes which was very pleasant but a little on the rich side. The second course (and quite possibly my favorite) was the tuna tartare which was served with a Cherry beer. I thought it was crazy at first as the tuna had flavours of sesame, coriander and chilli. But if you took a mouthful of the tuna, then had a sip of the beer something really interesting with the flavors happened. The cherry with the sesame actually worked and I never thought two such things would work. The third course was some langoustines with some thinly sliced pigs trotters which looked like it had a mustardy sauce on top and then underneath it was a green puree and it was very light but nice. This was matched with a Gewurztraminer that had also been blended with something else to which I can't quite remember. But the wine was very clean tasting and did cut through the mustard in the sauce really well. They then gave us a glass of champagne as there was a slight gap in next course arriving. For the fourth course we had some sea bass with parsnips and shallots. Very very simple but was the best piece of seabass I have ever eaten. This was matched with a wine that all I remember was from south west france. (My alcohol intake at this point was a glass of champagne at a place I met my parents previously, then a kir royale now 3 glasses of wine and a glass of cherry beer...I had been drinking lots of water too) The fifth course was a cheese and onion souffle which was like eating a cheesey cloud. You could hardly get it on the spoon as it was so light and this was served with another white, I think a riesling. This course was interesting but I personally thought it was a bit of cheese overkill, given we were going to have a cheese course as part of the tasting menu anyhow! But still it was pleasant enough and was a nice follow on from the sea bass and made a good prelude to the sixth course. Sixth course was venison with some green peppercorns and cranberries and it was lovely. Really nice and cleansing to the palate after having the souffle. This came with a red wine which wasn't a malbec but had the very similar chocolately smokiness of a malbec but sat lightly on the stomach. Then came the cheese course! I ate a small amount of cheese but for me the highlight of this was that they had my absolute favorite red wine ever. It was matched with a 2002 Pomerol which was divine! My Mum couldn't finish her Pomerol so I helped. As for cheeses they were all excellent and they had a really interesting variety on there but I was starting to feel absolutely stuffed. Finally we had the dessert! Which was a very beautiful upside down caramalised apple tart. Their caramel sauce was sooooo good! The ice cream was beautiful too, very vanillery and I had a candle in mine with Happy Birthday on the plate and everyone sang it to me too. The alcohol consumed by then meant that there was no embarassment to be had anymore! Then came some petit fours, I had a toffee covered gooseberry (and by watching how drunkenly romantic my parents were getting by then) I felt that was the most apt to have!",

We visited at lunch, where the set menu offers superb value: it includes half a bottle of wine, mineral water and coffee, while you don't miss out on extras including an amuse bouche and petits fours. I was particularly impressed that there was a choice of wines on this menu. The food is gorgeous: classical French cuisine with modern touches. Service is attentive and outstandingly good, while the surroundings are comfortable and classy (rather than light or contemporary). It's fun spotting little details like the 'gavroche' figure on cutlery handles and the cutlery sculptures on each table. Altogether, a lovely experience and at lunch, one offering excellent value.

    "text": "Forget The Ivy, where all the celebrities swarm and where people go to be 'seen', the real foodies go to Le Gavroche, a much more understated establishment in Mayfair renowned for its incredible food and service. It has to be said that Le Gavroche offers a unique dining experience for the uninitiated; you walk into a slightly dimly-lit basement, someone will pull out your chair for you and shake your napkin into your lap. You are treated like royalty (and you should be for the price). The French art of waiting is revived here, as the waiters take pride in their work, knowledge and appearance and are incredibly charming, and can even be cajoled into singing happy birthday on occasion (I was the lucky one!) The food defies description. I tried the milk-fed lamb from the Pyren\u00e9es back in January, and the August before I'd tried the ginger scallops; both were without a doubt the most amazing thing I'd ever tasted. Moreover, between courses (and to make it all the more special), you are plied with little amuse-bouches, tiny little morsels which only whet your appetite. This restaurant is without a doubt one of the best, and is for those who actually want good food, not food hyped up by glitz and glamour. However, gentlemen be warned - you still need a jacket; there's no slacking here.",

    "text": "Wow, it actually feels pretty intimidating to review Le Gavroche. Is my prose sufficiently eloquent to do justice to a restaurant which has led the way in London fine dining over the last 45 (yes, forty five) years.From the outside, the restaurant looks like a (very) nice house and if you didn't know what you were looking for you might miss it, especially in the day when it is not lit up. The restaurant itself is partially underground which could feel a little claustrophobic. Instead it feels warm and relatively relaxed for a place where gentlemen are asked to wear a jacket. However, it is still pretty traditional. For example, in addition to needing to wear a jacket, if you come here (as a man) with a female date they won't see the price of the dishes on the menu - that sharp intake of breath is reserved for men only! A bit quirky but quite fun if you don't take it too seriously.The food is why you come here. Classic French dishes delivered faultlessly. However wine lovers will have much to enjoy as well. A list which is bigger than many books awaits your perusal with expert guidance (thankfully) on hand to provide welcome recommendations if needed. So, to the food. The stand out dish that I have had is the Souffl\u00e9 Suissesse. This is a cheese souffle which is baked with double cream. No doubt this is horrifically bad for the diner's long term health. However, it tastes light and delicious. It is a dish that has stood the test of time, featuring on the a la carte menu for many many years. \u00a0 Almost all the food is served under cloches which results in some fab 'ceremonial' cloche lifting at the start of every course - super theatrical.Finally, it is worth mentioning that although the a la carte menu is expensive, the midweek lunch menu represents excellent value and allows Le Gavroche to be experienced at a very reasonable cost (\u00a351 per person including wine and coffee). You might even get to meet Michel Roux Jr!",

    "text": "Visiting London this past September, my family and I wanted to experience a wonderful meal which led us to Le Gavroche. This historic, Michelin 2-star restaurant was first opened by Michel and Albert Roux and now Albert's son, Michel Jr. runs the kitchen with mastery. The restaurant is very elegant and traditional in its decor. The color green is the dominant color I have to say. Service is sublime in that every server is attentive to the utmost detail. Now onto the food, in which we had the Menu Exceptionnel.-Lobster Salad w/ Mango, Avocado, Basil, and Lime: Deliciously light and refreshing. The flavors of the dish were bright and vibrant. I enjoyed the tender piece of lobster tail meat seated atop a piece of endive accompanied by small dice of sweet mango and buttery avocado. Definitely a winner.-Souffle Suissesse: One of the classic dishes of Le Gavroche. It's light, airy, cheesy, and temperature-wise definitely hot so be careful. The cream sauce that the souffle is sitting in makes you feel like perhaps you should see a cardiologist afterwards. Sinfully good.-Grilled Diver Caught Scallop, Spicy Aubergine, Fennel Pollen, and Parsley Coulis: Scallop was carefully grilled and therefore juicy and tender. The aubergine aka eggplant was OK only because I'm not a big fan of eggplant. Parsley coulis didn't really add much to the dish.-Hot Duck Foie Gras w/ Grapes and Crispy Duck Pancake Flavored w/ Cinnamon: The duck foie gras was luxurious. I love foie gras and it was seared perfectly. The crispy duck pancake was a bit odd as it was a savory dish that felt like a dessert. A bit too much cinnamon and sweetness for my taste.-Tender Braised Beef in Red Wine, Parsnip Puree, Cepes Mushrooms and Bacon: A very comforting dish that similar to good ol' meat and potatoes. The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender and just fell apart when you cut it with your fork. The red wine sauce was hearty and the parsnip puree was a nice twist on the mashed potatoes component. And huge chunks of bacon. Everything is exponentially better with bacon.-Selection of French and British Farmhouse Cheeses: I had a few slivers of cheese but was not a big fan. Not because they weren't great but because I'm not a connoisseur of fine cheeses.-Rich Amedei Chocolate Truffle Scented w/ Rum and Praline Crisp: Decadent and rich chocolate in a small cylindrical shape. And yes you can taste a bit of rum in there. Praline crisp was so-so. It added a nice textural component to the dessert.-Classic Upside Down Caramelized Apple Tarte w/ Vanilla Ice Cream: This dessert I was too big a fan of. The top part was slightly over-caramelized and therefore mildly burnt-tasting. The crust was too chewy and hard to cut with my spoon. The vanilla ice cream was good though but overall nothing spectacular about this dessert.We were seated across from the automatic sliding glass door in which staff would enter and exit the kitchen. As I was having my coffee, I see the door open and Michel Roux Jr. coming out like as if exiting his spaceship into the dining area. At the beginning of the meal, we had asked our maitre d' if he could sign a copy of the menu that was on our table. He then came to our table and greeted us and asked how our meal was. Then he signed our menu and he even graciously agreed to have a couple pictures taken with us. Overall, it was a great experience with classical French food. It's not a place where you'll find innovative dishes but it sticks to what it knows and what dishes have stood through the test of time. For 3 people it came out to \u00a3340 or about $600. A wonderful meal and a nice way to end our stay in London.",

    "text": "Possibly the biggest Yelp let-down of my life. I purposefully didn't write this review immediately because I wanted to compare Le Gavroche to some other restaurants in London first. The problems began because the reservations lady misinformed me as to when they would stop serving the tasting menu. This was supposed to be our first and nicest dinner during our London trip, and I got into an argument with the snooty and obnoxious maitre d' as to what had happened. They did end up serving us the food, but this made for a very unpleasant beginning to the evening, and I honestly felt bad for the other staff who was clearly embarrassed by the MD's behavior.I am only giving this three stars instead of two because of the extremely friendly and competent demeanor of some of the staff, such as the two female sommeliers and the young man in charge of the cheese tray and other matters. I say this because not only was the maitre d' unpleasant, but the food was not up to snuff for a place of this caliber. Many of the dishes were boring and some over-salted for my taste. I liked the seafood appetizer and various elements here and there, but when even your foie gras is mediocre, something is wrong.I am really torn about writing this review because I suspect many staff members, including cooks, worked hard on our meal and had to deal with the aftermath of the reservation lady's mistake and MD's attitude. But at the end of the day, you can't charge these prices unless your food is impeccable. Dinner by Heston Blumenthal in London can pull it off, as can Bouley in NYC. These guys, not so much.",

    "text": "I wish that I liked Le Gavroche more. It's a 'proper' restaurant with superb service and highly accomplished cooking, but.somehow the whole thing's a bit corporate; a bit dull and disappointing compared to the many French places that have much more elan. It's in nondescript block in Mayfair with a door that might harbour a hedge fund and there's a cramped reception desk where you and others arrivals will huddle uncomfortably before being moved into the bar - a nice bar but nothing special. But instead of being taken on into a bright, beautiful and interesting room (think the River Cafe, though the chairs are better here), you go down into a dark, green basement that feels as though it might be the home of mermaids. I went in telling my companions that I was looking forward to tasting a superb 'reduction' sauce - which is really where French classical cooking stands out - but the waiter barely paused at my question before suggesting a salad. Even the dish that we eventually settled on - warm fois gras - was poorly sauced and the accompanying duck pancake almost too small to taste. The troncon de turbot was so-so - a far better one can be had at the Poisonnerie. But assiette du chef - the selection of patisserie - was justly feted, and spoons appeared as if by magic from all over the table heedless of the risk of contracting fell disease, to feast on it. The restaurant was full - despite the \u00a3120 a head bill - which suggests that in such places 'recession' is a relative term. But it'll be another decade before I forget my disappointment and try again",

For just over 3 hours, I sat in complete and utter bliss and witnessed the most exquisite service I have ever seen.The service is so incredibly perfect that you don't even notice it happening. The waiters are so smooth and so seemless that you are never left wanting for anything- I have never experienced anything like it before. My glass was constantly full, though I never noticed it being filled and our napkins was always beautifully arranged when we came back from the bathroom, though no-one ever saw who did it. To make things even more perfect, Michel Roux came over TWICE to see if we were enjoying our meal (we were more than enjoying it)The menu is incredible but because my French is quite poor, the waiter was very helpful and pleased to take me through the menu and explain it throroughly (and he didn't make me feel embarassed for asking) The food was perfect. I had a shellfish soup to start with lobster, prawns,scallops and I think snails (though I am not entirely sure) and a game pie with artichoke hearts for a main course. \u00a0The dessert selection was wonderful- I picked from a large trolley of sorbets and homemade ice creams, whilst my boyfriend had a rich chocolate log. We were both very impressed with the amount of extra bits we both got- two types of amuse bouches and a large plate of some delicious petit fours. La Gavroche is without doubt the best restaurant in London.",

From memory it is remarkably small inside which means that it feels very cosy and exclusive. Wonderfully elegant with all the right things in the right places you really will get a sense of grandeur and feel very special to be in such surroundings. The food is too die for and the wine simply exquisite. Now you would imagine that a place like this has to be expensive and it can be. That said you can choose from a fixed price menu, a seven course fixed price menu or go for the full blown a'la carte. Then seven course meal was \u00a395 which whilst that sounds expensive it is exceptional value for money to experience such food from such a chef in such a setting. If you want the best in London, this has to be right up there.",

We got the later sitting at 9:30pm and although it was a tad bit late for such heavy food, we still enjoyed it. We didn't do the set menu but decided to order off the a la carte menu instead. The food was fantastic. We had lobster, cheese souffl\u00e9, crab and more lobster. It was very heavy, dominated by cream and butter, but of course very delicious. For dessert, we had a caramelized pears in filo pastry, which was, by far one of the better desserts I have ever eaten. Highly recommended! All in all, it was a brilliant experience. The cherry on the cake was of course meeting Michel Roux Jr. himself who came by the table to exchange a few words!!",

I think Michel Roux Jnr's popularity yo-yo's like the stock market depending on the relative recency of professional Masterchef, and I stupidly tried to book immediately after the last series. (Maybe turning off my chainsaw before I called might not have scared the Maitre'd so much).Nonetheless, I succeeded last week and six of us dined for lunch, taking advantage of the extremely reasonable \u00a348 set menu. A starter of Venison carpaccio and spring salad was tasty but dull, prompting immediate food envy upon the arrival of somebody's poached pike in lobster sauce. A main of lamb offal however, was a delight, with delicately grilled tongue, fried sweetbreads and kidneys. To finish, a child-like delve into an extensive cheese board capped off a superb meal.Spring water and a 1/2 bottle of wine are included in the price, as is all the pomp and necessity one would expect from such an old-school French establishment. Don't forget your dinner jacket gents and enjoy watching the 40-strong waiting staff navigate their way around the room without crashing into one another...although you'll have your fingers crossed the whole time that they do!",

Not a single cooked dish from so called 'exceptional' tasting menu had a wow-factor, apart from the cheeseboard (which I must say was very impressive).Very dated, tired interior, dark and unwelcoming.Service was just okay, didn't make the dinner feel special, definitely not personal for such calibre restaurant.Overall, quite a disappointing experience considering it took over 2 years to make a booking over an old-fashioned form-based reservation \"system\".I've been to quite a few Roux's restaurants in London. I'd rather recommend 'Roux at Parliament Square' - very pleasant, delicious meal with great value for money. Even Roux's stall at Taste of London summer festival at Regent's Park was way more exciting.For special occasions, better visit L'enclume by Simon Rogan in Cartmel (or his restaurants La Fera and Roganic in London), Le Manoir by Raymond Blanc in Oxfordshire, or Sat Bains in Nottingham - these are really worth a detour.",

I was really excited to come here, having been recommended to come here (by someone I don't know well) and seeing all the great reviews. The venue seemed alright, the lighting was a bit dim for my taste, but it was nice. The service was lovely and I really do enjoy the pride they take in serving the meal. No food was served for any course until each of us had a waiter standing next to us holding our food, so that they could serve us all at the same time. Little details like that stand out, and I especially enjoyed the dishes served with a flourish by showing me a gorgeous silver covered dish and them removing it to present the food like a show. Even the gelato dessert was served well; a trolley with silver domes holding different ice cream flavours was rolled to us and the waitress asked what flavour was wanted, scooping out each flavour one by one into a plate. \u00a0But that doesn't change the fact that the gelato was extremely mediocre. I could hardly bring myself to eat any of it, it was mostly too tart and not tasty in any way. The best dish I had was my scallop appetiser, which while decent, certainly doesn't deserve to be especially remembered in any way. The rack of lamb I ordered was difficult to eat; I was sawing away at it with my knife trying to get a piece at least. \u00a0It wasn't tasty in any way and was too chewy. I went with three other people, and every single one of us was taken aback by the lack of any particular merit to any of our dishes. We couldn't even say that we had liked one thing, and we all ordered different appetisers and mains, so I don't think the problem was just particular to me. Mostly we just felt terrible that we had spent far more on this meal than on any other in London, but we had enjoyed it the absolute least. It was also a special occasion and made it difficult to enjoy the birthday, with the excitement and expectation we had arrived with. I would certainly never come back to spend this much money for something so subpar and can get much tastier food elsewhere in London. I wish the food had been as good as the service.",

Right when we were first seated at our table, we were already made to feel quite uncomfortable for being tourists and non-French speaking (we are Asian-American and dressed nicely according to their dress code). I even noticed that the servers seemed to be rudely and openly mocking us, trying to imitate our \"American accent.\" I did not want that to be ruining my overall judgement of their food, however, and went on with the meal. I notified them that I was very allergic to lamb and I am slightly lactose intolerant.. but it seemed like they customized my courses to where there was absolutely no meat, and every plate that was supposed to have meat was replaced with vegetables. The wine pairings were also not explained in-depth and when I tried to ask, it seemed like they took offense that I was questioning their pairing selections.Overall, I would definitely not return to this restaurant based on the price we paid for the service/food we received. I left with a poor taste in my mouth and saddened that I was treated differently as a paying customer just because I was not a London native.",

We had the Tasting Menu and was truly delighted with every dish that was served up. Le Gavroche may have one of the best wine cellars in London with bottles ranging up to \u00a320,000 but we can also have decent bottles of wines from \u00a350. We selected the Gigondas 2011 from Rhone which went really well with the partridge main course. Excellent service and Michel Roux Jr came round twice to say hello, which truly made our day. An unforgettable evening made splendid by the warm welcome we received!",

    "text": "My Le Gavroche experience was one of three fancy tasting-menu dinners I got to try while I was in London for three weeks -- the other two being Maze (the Asian side, not the grill) and Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester. \u00a0Le Gavroche was, hands down, my favorite. \u00a0Absolutely no contest.I had been unable to get a reservation to Le Gavroche because I was travelling on very short notice, so I requested to be put on a waiting list, and, happily, was taken off the wait-list the morning of my visit. \u00a0(As an aside, my entire series of interactions with the reservation staff was excellent.)Because I was travelling alone, I also was dining alone. \u00a0That can often be awkward, and sometimes a restaurant doesn't quite know what to do with you (reactions range from pitying looks, to offers of a book, to being seated in a corner and facing the corner). \u00a0But, unsurprisingly, the staff at Le Gavroche made me feel exceptionally welcome (and not at all pitied for being out by myself!).I ordered the tasting menu, which was, as expected, spectacular. \u00a0It started with their famous cheese souffl\u00e9 (which was truly epic, and something that should be on your bucket list!). \u00a0Next was a roast scallop dish with carrot and chartreuse - my favorite dish of the night. \u00a0Third was a stone bass with a fennel coulis. \u00a0Fourth was a pigs' head terrine with snails - so wonderful. \u00a0The main course was a roast squab, which was followed by a selection of cheeses, pistachio cake, and petit fours. \u00a0Everything was delightful, and the staff was so helpful and attentive.The wine pairings were also fantastic, and every wine was carefully explained. \u00a0Also, if you order the tasting menu, you are given a small version of it to keep (which is very nice, seeing as it is hard to remember details of what you ate and drank... particularly vintners and vintages).The cheese course was simultaneously overwhelming (in a positive way) and awesome - I was presented with a large rolling table with no less than 40 or 50 different kinds of cheese which I could choose from. \u00a0Thankfully, the staff helped me make my selections, as, by this time, I had drunk a fair bit of wine, and really wasn't going to be capable of making advisable decisions!!This experience was truly the highlight of my trip, and a memory I will not soon forget. \u00a0Also, Michel Roux Jr. came out of the kitchen to say hello to me (and everyone else in the dining room), which caught me off guard (and, frankly, half terrified me), but it was an exceptionally kind gesture.As a totally irrelevant aside, the clientele at Le Gavroche was truly fascinating (when one dines alone, there isn't much to do besides get lost in your own thoughts and stare at other people); there were young couples, old couples, families, friends... it ranged widely. \u00a0The dining room is exceptionally cozy and comfortable, and everyone seemed to be having a wonderful time. \u00a0I'm not entirely sure why, but this was not the experience I had at many of the other restaurants I visited - something about Le Gavroche's atmosphere meant that people seemed much more engaged with their loved ones (fewer cell phones, to be sure). \u00a0It was a breath of fresh air.I would come all the way back to London just to visit Le Gavroche.",

I wanted the \"Menu Exceptionnel\" and they were ok in giving me this 9 course meal especially this late at night. I paired that with the wine and it was perfect.Although, it did feel that they had to rush me since it was obvious that the workers wanted to go home. But what can you do?But anyways, regardless of what time your reservation is, go for the \"Menu Exceptionnel\" with the wine pairing.Started off with the Cheese Souffle cooked on Double Cream. My first bite gave me that shock and awe moment. I knew then that my experience here was going to be a great one.The same goes for course 2 through 9. But I'm not going to write a dissertation on every course. But I did enjoy the cheese cart and yes, I got some macarons at the end.The ambiance here is great. The paintings on the walls alone would make me come back. They even have a few prints by Picasso too. So you're getting fine dining and some culture as well. And as a gift, you get to keep the really cool menu too. After all, it's hard enough to hear the French/British accent when they announce your meal to you throughout the evening so at least you now know what you ate throughout the evening.Jackets are required, ties are optional. Make sure your credit card can handle tonight's main event. Because remember, it's in pounds, not dollars. And on your way out at the lobby, there is more free stuff you can get too including books and magazines.Michelin 2 stars 2012.",

However when Michael Roux Jr took over his father Albert Rouz restaurant he had asked the Michelin to revaluate the restaurant and they had awarded him with the two michelin star. Regardless of the Michelin star system Le Gavroche has considtently placed in restaurant's top 50. Truely I had hard time understanding the overall theme of the meal and it just seem bit out of place. Nothing really made me satisfied and for me this is not very good. Because I don't usually prefer certain style but when I feel some rhythm feels off, the chef or dish has been lost. Regardless I would not dine here ever again.",

The guide may have lost its way but LE Gavroche has stayed true.Discrete understated decor and excelent service reliably wonderful food, the same experience every time.

We had the wines to match each course for the tasting menu, which isn't always a good idea if you're a bit of a light weight like me, as you can find yourself distracted away from the food and i'm a bit disappointed in myself for not pacing myself a bit more! :P The satff were great, really friendly and we had a good laugh with them through out the evening. Not at all stuck up as a lot of people may expect it to be. Michelle Roux popped out of the kitchen on a number of occasions to say hi to guests and see if they were enjoying their meals! I ended up getting a pic with him at the table, think it was the Dutch courage as he i really respect him as a chef and never thought for a second I would ask! It's very romantic. A brilliant place for a lovely date, or a classy catch up with friends. I recommend it to everyone, you should go at least once!",

I had a veggi tasting menu, which was basically the standard one with the meat swapped out, which is just awful. Good restaurants of this class actually think about what a vegetarian option should be and do something interesting. The wine pairing was average and the sommelier provided almost no information about what the wines were or why they were chosen. The whole experience was expensive and awful.

Five of us had the tasting menu and what can I say that hasn't already been said? Everything was wonderful - a couple of us struggled with the snail dish, but not me, the unbelievable hollandaise that came with it was good enough to bathe in. In fact I hoovered up an extra snail. A couple of warnings - beware the bread, and beware the cheese! We went nuts on the cheese trolley (that was all five of us yelling comte! simultanenously...it lived up to our high expectations) and I have NEVER been so full in my life. The dishes are small but deceptively rich. There are three sets of petit fours, and we had to take two home!Our first bottle of white wasn't knock-your-socks-off, but the bottle of red the sommelier recommended was absolutely delicious - chocolate and pepper and everything she promised, and it went grandly with the venison. There was only one teeny tiny (literally) thing we didn't like - a teeny tiny radish that sat next to the foie gras parfait. It was so bitter it took your breath away. But the parfait and confit carrot (how do you confit a carrot?!) took your breath away for the other reason - it tasted amazing. Seven stars.... I wish I could eat here every day, though I would die of a heart attack very very quickly. They even stuck a candle in my baba and wrote happy birthday in chocolate - what more could a girl want?",
