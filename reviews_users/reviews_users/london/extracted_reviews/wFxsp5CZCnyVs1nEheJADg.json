Our Empanadas to start the meal were solid, no surprises there (had the beef and corn ones) and then my churrasscaria lomo was fairly good. Not as tender as as I expected for a marinated steak. As sides the portobello mushrooms tasted great.The ambience reminds me of a cow theme gone awry in an upscale restaurant and the music is a little loud in to have a conversation but the upstairs seemed quieter.",

    "text": "Decorated like a goth's wet dream. This is uber masculine design. Consisting entirely of blacks, mirrors and the odd flashes of cow, the room disorientates at first, black doors open onto black rooms through black walls, until you manage to pick out the shades. The crowd in the place is similarly male, a slightly confused couple sat next to us slotted uneasily next to large groups of braying men, flushed of face with bonhomie, wine, good steak and self importance. Deals weren't being done, but like Keens and the grand old tradition of New York steakhouses, they were certainly being celebrated.It didn't start well for for the restaurant service wise I have to say.. We sat in the (black) departure lounge of the bar and sipped insipid cocktails. I went for the Bloody Asado, a watery \u00a38's worth of roasted plum tomato, red pepper and vodka, reminiscent of a very cheap salsa. 45 minutes after our reservation time we were still sat there. The location and the crowd would suggest they are focussed firmly on the volume business market and a random three top is of less interest.We finally sat down at a table an hour and 15 after our reservation. The urgent need now was for food and fast so we skipped the starters and got straight in. For the record, the starters have always been a hit in the past. Fresh fish ceviche and tiraditos are bright and clean, served straight up with lime and lemon, the citric acid 'cooking' the meat. My guest and I looked no further than the Gaucho Sampler, a 1.2kg board of fillet, rump, sirloin and ribeye. The meat arrived served as requested (though identified incorrectly by the server) and was a melting joy. With a bottle of excellently chosen Malbec, recommended by the server (one bright spot was their wine training) the meat was exactly what we needed. Moving through the sampler board from cleanest (fillet) to most complex (ribeye) flavours I was amazed by how clearly the differences in cut shone through when served alongside each other. It's a must do experience for the steak lover. Sides were largely forgettable (and incorrect).Ultimately you're here for the meat, and probably business. If you're looking for a great steak experience in London then go to Hawksmoor or Goodman. If you're looking for an authentic Argentinian steak restaurant, go to Buen Ayre in Broadway Market. If you're bringing your (mainly male) team to celebrate winning a piece of business over a few bottles of Malbec and some decent steak, then the Gaucho will do just fine.",

While they do have vegetarian options on the menu the decor is reminiscent of cows with cow skin chairs etc... This is the only good steak I have found in all of England, and that is because it is real Argentinian Beef. Everything was delicious. If you order medium rare, they will come a bit on the rare side, but will be tender and delicious. We ordered chips, spinach, and corn as sides and found it was too much food for us to get through for \u00a02 of us. I would definitely recommend it and hope to go back soon!",

    "text": "If you like eating beef, you'll like Gaucho. This particular franchise of the Gaucho chain has a location that's difficult to beat, in a modern part of town and with panoramic views of the Thames and the beautiful Tower Bridge.Gaucho isn't designed for vegetarians. It's all about meat here, and cow flesh in particular. Before you choose from the menu, a waiter will present you with the available cuts - large lumps of muscle and fatty tissue on a wooden board, which has been known to dribble a trail of cold blood onto the table. They leave the fur on the leather upholstery which generously covers the chairs, walls and indeed various other surfaces, and I'd wager that the interior-designer intentionally selected skins from breeds of beef cattle decorated with the most characteristically bovine of patterns. It's barbaric, really. It's a celebration and flaunting the sacrificial act of killing and eating another animal. Do modern Homo sapiens really need to do kill inferior species in order to eat? I recommend the sirloin or fillet cuts, and also the burger. Moo.The wine list is clearly intended to impress -- which it succeeds in doing. Incidentally, during my last visit I found one of the best red wines I've tasted in a while. I don't usually drink red wine, but this variety was recommended to me and the colour does somehow seem to match the overall theme of blood and red meat. I'll update this review with details when I find the note I made. I'm afraid I'd had rather a lot of the stuff by the time it came to choosing a safe place to file my note.",

Amazing steak (I had the medallion filet which is so juicy and flavorful I didn't really use my sauce) and amazing side dishes (loved them all except for the fries/chips). Everyone at the table loved the little warm cheese rolls that come with bread... so much that they would have been happy to eat nothing but that all night!I was so annoyed that it had taken me nearly a year living in London to discover Gaucho... that I went again the next night! I came to this one because I love the area right by the river and Tower Bridge near the really cool ultra-modern glass buildings.

    "text": "Sometimes I believe there's a force in the Universe that just pushed you in a direction you are destined to go.Prior to us heading to London for our friend's wedding, I spent quite a bit of time trying to find a really good restaurant for my wife and I to eat at on our first night there. \u00a0After many hours of reading reviews and other recommendations, I chose Gaucho but the original location I was looking at was booked solid, so I saw that they had some other locations and saw that this one was pretty open for a Thursday night. \u00a0Sometimes that makes me stop and think on whether or not that's a good sign, but I ploughed ahead and said, \"well, it won't be our last meal\".I had no idea that this is basically at the foot of our offices in London and that several of my fellow co-workers eat here regularly when they are in London on business. \u00a0What a great find.We arrived early and although our table was ready the hostess offered us the chance to settle in with a drink in the small bar area. \u00a0Absolutely.Right around our reservation time, she came and got us and brought us to our table in the front window. \u00a0Usually I don't like those especially on really cold nights (with huge glass windows) but the view of Tower Bridge from there, light up nicely is really really cool.We started off with some Empanadas which were pretty good. \u00a0Not the best I've had but nonetheless, a good beginner.I ordered the Bife de Lomo (Filet Mignon) and MK ordered the Bife Ancho which is the Ribeye. \u00a0I added in a peppercorn sauce and we both ordered the sweet potato chips w/chorizo.Steaks were perfectly cooked and the chips were very good although I could have used a bit more chorizo in there.For drinks, MK was tasting several of the drinks of the day and I stuck with their house Pilsner (Rocio). \u00a0We were stuffed otherwise we would have loved getting dessert.Restaurant was very attentive at calling us a taxi while we were still at the table but there's not really a good place for the taxi to pick you up as this is deep into that office complex and close to the River Thames. \u00a0But we made do just the same.",

Waiters show flavorful cuts of meat to you within minutes of sitting down, explaining the seasonings and giving those who have not had the experience a good glimpse into the meal to come.Their bread basket comes with a dish of oil, brown bread, and small cheese-puff bread with a tapioca interior consistency, salty and flavorful. Empanadas are baked, not fried. The grilled palmito and shrimp salad is fresh and crisp. Kitchen area is set up in the back of the restaurant, in the modern style that is common for higher end restaurants nowadays, so if you really are fascinated enough, you can peek over at the cooks sweating over their grill (hopefully not onto your food).In my brief stint working in London, I liked to alternate between the bife de lomo (beef fillet cut) and the churrasco cuts, (pre-marinated beef spiral cuts). Depends on whether I want my own sauce with the fillet, or feeling like their churrasco sauce. Spinach and/or potatoes with chorizo round out my main.Drinks are stellar -- their specialty cocktail menu is very tasty as well, with drinks that combine cachaca, gin, vidka, etc... even a fairly decent selection of whiskey for those who hunger for a true \"steakhouse\" combination.I miss thee Gaucho, and thy heavenly cuts of beef.",

    "text": "Where to go for a business lunch, why not Gauchos? I've been many times pre my yelp days, so I'll give you a bit of a rundown what it's all about first. This is a chain that have popped up in London the last 10 years or so and it follows a leather and cow-skin interior and a high class food and service standard. My view is that this is a great establishment for business or a group of rowdy guys having a nice dinner out. Nothing that you want to bring a date, girlfriend or wife to for a romantic dinner, as even if the food is good and the service is great, it's still not romantic (except if your date is a raging meatist or gets turned on by the cheer cost). \u00a0Gaucho, the word is loosely equivalent to the north American \"cowboy\" and refers to the rural cattle herders in south America. So, in short, if you are a veggie, stay way clear and this is not the place for you as it is a feast in cow meat. The location of this Gauchos is perfect for an 'London experience', it views over Tower Bridge, and with window seats (as we had), a clear evening and then the lights from the bridge makes it 'picture pretty' view. Before they come and take your order they show up at your table with a big board with the meats they offer (no, not pictures, pieces of the actual meat) and explain the differences and how they are best cooked based around the cut and amount of fat in it. You order your meat, size (in grams before cooked), side dishes (the meat is meat only, no chips and such are on the plate by default) and any starters etc So, now my visit... went there last night meeting up a few friends I've been working with over the years. We meet up at lunch time and started on the \"complimentary\" bread rolls, the small bread rolls (4-5cm across) are absolutely divine as they have been baked in a way that gives them a crispy shell and in them the bread has been mixed with cheese making them so nice you can eat just those for dinner (careful though, I suspect these bad boys aren't for anyone on a diet... that's why they are so good!). For starter we had a couple of sausage platters, a perfect start on the meat feast we were to embark upon. The platters had a selection of different Argentinean sausage and each of those were perfectly made (no supermarket knockoffs here). For main I ordered one of the marinated cuts (that had been marinated at least 24 hours) cooked to medium rare. We also ordered a set of side dishes for the table, rather do our owns, it works out best that way as you then get to taste all of them rather then get stuck with something you might not enjoy too much... we also got a couple of bottles of wine for the table, please note, that most likely by mistake the waiter did bring the wrong wine at first and if you spend 77 quid a pop you want to make sure you get what you pay for. The meat was cooked to perfection, tasted amazing and the sides accompanied the meat perfectly... same as always, an excellent food experience and in good company an unforgettably moment in time. The time rolled on, we ended up discussions on life and for dessert we shared a couple of cheese platters. The cheeses was well selected but nothing that you wouldn't get elsewhere. Normally they serve it with some chutney, but they forgot to tell us that it wasn't available as they had run out. The head waiter, an very service mined and friendly girl proposed that we could get a glass of port each as a substitute to the chutney, we gladly accepted and she saved the whole experience to end up in a big disappointment. We then, ended the lunch with a couple of drinks each, I had a Gin & Tonic, and lastly we left almost 6 hours after we had arrived. Yes the staff changed mid through from lunch to dinner and at some moments we were the only guests. An unforgettable experience and I'm sure to be back...",

    "text": "In those dark dark days before the Hawksmoor opened, I considered Gaucho arguably one of the best steaks in London. Whilst it's no longer my go-to place for beef, it's still a really consistently good franchise.Staff upon arrival were cheery and helpful. Rocking up at the last minute without knowing the management of a busy restaurant invariably results in killing time at the bar drinking beer (the delightful Rocio Gold, which I still haven't seen anywhere else besides Gaucho). After a short wait we were escorted to our table and greeted by our waiter - professional, friendly and efficient, as their staff usually are.Delightful breads and chimichurri arrived, the most enjoyable of which are their pao de quiejo (little cheese buns) which, if you catch them fresh out of the oven, are about as mind-blowing as a night with Jessica Alba. Oh how I wish I could actually support that comparison with evidence ...Food here is mainly focused on lovely Argentinean beef - there are some reasonable looking alternatives, but no-one really comes here for anything but steak. It's like going to McDonald's for a salad, or a fish restaurant for a steak. Or Angus Steak House for something resembling actual food.Steaks are available in varying sizes to cater to even the most substantial appetite. Their beef is good quality and always makes for a perfectly respectable meal. Not the best steak in town, but definitely a good performer. A current special of fillet with bacon and stilton was solid if a little sparse on the stilton, and at \u00a337 is on the pricey side, especially as it was only 300g. Usually I'd expect to be paying circa \u00a330.Sides of crisp fries and perfectly-cooked lemony spinach made a delightful accompaniment to round out the meal. Throw in a bottle of Luigi Bosca Malbec on this occasion, from their narrow but deep wine list (all Argentinean if I recall correctly, but a great selection), and we were on to a winner. Ultimately, if you want a good steak in London, there are slightly better choices, but Gaucho usually has a table (with a short wait at worst) and you're rarely more than 15 minutes away from one when in Central or the Docklands, and it's a perfectly good night out.",

Second, \u00a0the hostess is very welcoming and the service is great. The restaurant is very moody, it's dark, covered in dark brown leather, cow hide accents here and there, black ceiling, modern crystal chandeliers, it just puts you in the mood for beef. \u00a04 of us split the Guacho Sampler, it came with sirloin, fillet, rump and rib eye, done a perfect medium.For sides we got the hand cut chips, they are topped with sea salt, garlic and herbs...addictive! The sweet peas with bacon lardons (fresh thick cut ham chunks - my translation) and mixed salad with a simple vinaigrette. \u00a0All of it tasted fresh and delicious. \u00a0My mouth is starting to water as I write this. \u00a0We washed it all down with a couple bottles of Malbec, oh the sweet nectar. \u00a0Awesome meal.",

    "text": "This is a difficult one.. I think the trick is if you like medium rare like me, then make sure you ask for rare, if you like well done then ask for medium, etc.The starters were lovely, the staff were really lovely, the cocktail I had was OK not great. The waiter didn't give us a menu as he kind of offered us whatever we wanted which was nice but it would have been good to know what they had available. The mains were disappointing sadly, my boyfriend had the fillet in breadcrumbs which tasted lovely but was a bit dry. I had the trio of medallions which I asked for medium rare: the fillet was cooked medium and very dry for a fillet, which I expected to be the best cut, the sirloin(?) was cooked well done, I can't really explain how well done it was! I had to tell the waiter which I never like to do, but he happily replaced this medallion for me with a perfectly medium rare one, the rump looked medium rare to the eye but was really crispy on the outside and the texture was quite dry, tasted like medium.The sauces were amazing the garlic oil and the chimichurri, we were nicely full so didn't have desserts. The broccoli was a nice vegetable side. Overall it was a very expensive bill over \u00a3100 which I wouldn't normally mind for really good steak, but I left a little disappointed. I'm glad we tried gaucho as we love to have steak everywhere! but I'm not sure we would come here again :(",

All locations have similar theme, but each also has its own charm. This location is right on The River Thames and you have a gorgeous view of the Tower Bridge. Enjoy a nice juicy steak with a view, now you can't beat that! The menu is quite big and definitely brings a lot of South American flavors: they offer a variety of Ceviche (raw fish marinated in lime juicy), empanadas (Baked dumpling), and steak with chimichurri sauce. As enticing as all the starters and mains sound, I come here usually for nothing but the steak. I love the way they help you pick your meat. Different cuts of raw beef are presented on a cutting board and the server will explain to you what cut it is, what the flavor profile is, and how much you should order. You can have a piece as small as small as 225g or as big as 800g! Since I love my meat marbled, so I always go with rib-eye. It is not a cheap meal, but it is totally worth the money.",

Starters were wonderfully paired with a glass of Piedra Ceraza 2015. As a Pinot Noir it paired with starters without overpowering the dishes. Wine pairings for starters and mainstream were requested by the glass and our server was quick to recommended a choice of pairings of very good Argentinian wines. Mains was a ribeye with anchovy butter. Great combination on a medium rare steak with good marveling. Good wine pairing again with a Gran Lurton \u00a0Cabernet Sauvignon 2011, enough wood in the wine to clear the palate without drowning out the flavour of the meat. I preferred this choice to the malbec on offer. While still a great wine it was too heavy. Desert included cheese cake and chocolate mouse. I can say without hesitation that everything from the breads to the desert showed great planning and foresight and was executed superbly.",

    "text": "Man oh man ABSOLUTELY amazing! Made reservations about 3-4 days before and requested a view of the tower bridge when we went on our trip to London. Got to the area about a hour or two before our reservations and they had a whole outdoor extravaganza with little truck bars opened up service awesome drinks while taking in the amazing views. Got to the restaurant our table was ready for us which had an amazingggg view of tower bridge (which the table was not guaranteed with this view) started off with some bottles of wine and appetizers and as we selected our meats they bring the meats out to you and show you the marbling on the meat itself and go over in detail about the meat before bringing it out. Some of the juiciest steaks I've ever had. Amazing service amazing food amazing view. Should book another trip to London just for Gaucho.",

Ordered the dulce de leche cheesecake and it was spectacular! \u00a0The dessert sampler had a bread pudding (dry), a crumble (boring taste) and a mousse (decent). \u00a0The restaurant itself was very pretty, loved the lighting and the seatjn",

    "text": "WORST SERVICE EVER by a server named Renato. This is my first time ever writing a review because I really felt there is a need for it. When I first sat down, I was asked around 10 times whether I wanted still or sparkling water, and I kept answering \"please let me wait for my friend while I'll have tap water for the time being.\" He then kept pushing for some cocktails and wine, and I had to reply with the same answer again. When my friend arrived, he kept asking the same question again, \"still or sparkling?\" and my friend said \"tap water, please\". When my friend asked for a refill of tap water, Renato got a bottle of STILL water, opened it behind us, and poured it into my friends cup, when the cup still had half a glass of TAP water. This kind of service shouldn't be allowed at any restaurants, let alone one of Gaucho's price and name. Furthermore, when I was in the moment of putting the last few pieces of steak into my mouth, Renato appears out of nowhere and just takes my plate when I was still holding the fork and knife and ingesting the steak, without even asking me whether I'm done or not. In addition, the main courses came basically right after we finished our starters, and my friend and I didn't even get a chance to relax before we had to deal with our main courses. We went on a Thursday night, and it was quite busy there, and it seems that commission-hungry Renato just wanted us out of the restaurant so he could serve his next customers, and push the next customers for some still water.This dinner would've been better if the food was exceptional, so that the horrible service would be outweighed a bit. But it was not. For the 300g ribeye steak I got, there were bare any char-grilled marks on the steak, and the flavour wasn't what I expected from a steakhouse which is supposedly to be one of the better ones in London. All in all, this was the most unpleasant meal so far I've sad in my trip to London. Yes, it was a nice location by the Tower Bridge, but nothing justifies Renato's shocking service, and having a mediocre steak doesn't help this case at all.I wouldn't recommend anyone going to this restaurant at all. If you must, please avoid the name by the name of Renato.",

However from the moment we were seated until we left our waiter and the manager were constantly checking on us to make sure we had what we wanted. \u00a0The food was excellent. I had the chorizo steak which was done to perfection. Washed it down with a mint julip and then had some warm Argentinian rice pudding for desert.The final damage was a bit eye watering but I think well worth it",

    "text": "Ok I'm a fan of Gaucho's having been to a few of them around London. This one by far has the best view, as long as the upstairs is open you will get a great view of Tower Bridge. Unfortunately thew upstairs section was not open for our visit which was a shame as it was a Birthday celebration. It was probably not open as it was a Sunday would be my guess.Upon arrival we were greeted with the usual Gaucho gusto. Coats and bags were taken and we were given the choice of going straight to our table or grab a cocktail first, needless to say the cocktail option won!They have some comfortable seats by the bar in which to take your cocktail. We were given plenty of time to select our drinks, they were made swiftly once we had decided, we had a novice cocktail drinker with us so it took a while.Once we had received our drinks we moved across to our table, we did reject the first table as it offered little to none of the great few outside. Once settled we under went the usual what shall we have debate, the cheese bread is always a must when you visit a Gaucho. After the usual sales pitch from our waitress about the different cuts of meat.The service was to the usual high standard I have come to expect from Gaucho's, the timings of our meal was spot on never waiting to long between courses. Those of us who had steak could not grumble about the quality of the meat and the fact they were cooked exactly as requested.I like Gaucho's and will continue to visit them when I can afford them and if you are reading this it is not a cheap evening out, but worth it in my opinion.",

    "text": "The starters here are quite good and innovative. Somehow, I must have not been lucky with the beef last couple times I went there. The first time my ribeye came out well done when I ordered it medium rare. The next time I went there, my lomo fillet was cooked as ordered. However, both times I didn't feel like the meat had much flavor to it - tasted a bit bland and metallic. I must confess that I am more used to steaks done the US or European way. I prefer the taste of wood smoke and the searing that comes from an open flame. I don't think its this preference though as I've eaten at other S. American restaurants (see my other reviews) and the beef there has been amazing.I don't want to be unkind, because I know that Gaucho is supposed to be a decent restaurant, but perhaps it has become a bit of chain and lost its original magic? The only reason why I'm so critical is because the prices are high.The ambience at the London Bridge one is goog though and the view across the iconic Tower Bridge at night is amazing.",
