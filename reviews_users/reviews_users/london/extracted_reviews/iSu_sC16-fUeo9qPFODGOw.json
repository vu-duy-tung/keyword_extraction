Grandfather was running the kitchen, Son was greeting and taking orders and youngsters were there eating. Food was just fabulous. Spinach and ricotta tortellini was divine. Dining partners had the spaghetti with prawn and chilli, they loved it. Service was friendly not posh. We were in a time constraint due to going to the theatre. My next visit will be longer to enjoy all the courses. ( they have a 2 course pre-theatre prix fixe for \u00a317.50). Highly recommended.",

It is not without its faults (see, i.e., interior design above), but after their bread basket improved immensely of late, Vasco & Piero's has just moved up to my number 2 favourite Italian restaurant in London.",

    "text": "Vasco & Piero's Pavilion has been there for 40 odd years, anonymously squatting on the unlovely Poland Street. Synonymous with London's media scene, it's one of those places that advertising execs used to take folk for a roister-doister, \"it's alright, we're not needed back at the office anytime soon, now how about that contract\" lunch into afternoon into evening event to celebrate. And in all the times I've been in there, in that state, I've never remembered to ask about the name though...The menu downstairs is set, something I'd be less bothered about if there were more than eight of us. Especially having drooled over the menu upstairs, with its extensive list of pastas and wonderful sounding dishes; lombetto, a cured loin of Umbrian pork, tortellioni of duck or seabass, fennel flavoured salamis, the list goes on...Not having been there for a few years, I was looking forward to this. God knows why, but I went for a standard but unadventurous asparagus and mozzarella starter. Nothing special. It came drizzled with a beautifully fresh, zingy and fragrant basil oil but the trimmed asparagus felt like it hadn't been out of the fridge for long enough. I suppose it's partly my fault for ordering it way out of season. If the starter was a bit of a let down, then the pasta course reminded me why I love good Italian food. Little pockets of silky smooth aubergine ravioli came with tooth sticking aubergine skin fried into tiny tasty splinters scattered atop the sun yellow pasta parcels. The room silenced until the pasta had vanished. The main of duck breast was served simply with green beans, great quality ingredients and lovely with a lipsmacking jus. A simple desert of baked ricotta was slightly spoilt by too sharp raspberries, but was in itself lovely. Like Andrew Edmunds, The Ivy and a number of other little Soho gems, it hasn't changed much in years, and keeps going in such a cutthroat location because it gets the fundamentals right time after time. The chefs inspiration, and many of the ingredients, come from Umbria in central Italy. They cater to a local crowd who know the staff and each other and take the odd party, like us, and shoehorn them away in a downstairs room where they won't disturb the regulars. Not that I minded, it was perfectly pleasant, if a little like dining in a provincial hotel with it's light and forgettable decor. On thing to note about the upstairs is that the noise levels frequently get high. It's not somewhere for a quiet tete a tete (but ideal to tell someone some bad news..)",

We were put off for a moment, but they took our coats and brought us prosecco while we were waiting. While we waited we got to take in the scene and talk to one of the owners. The proprietors are a father and son from Umbria, been in business for 40+ years. Most of the staff is from Italy. You certainly can taste that in the food! I'll definitely be back for more. My chicken was incredible. The beets with ginger were a delightful twist. I ate every bite on my plate, and I'm usually a half eater! Everyone in my party was very happy with their pasta dishes and salads as well. The staff were all very friendly and sweet with our 8 year old.",

As soon as we got there, we knew we were in for a treat. Yes, the decor is a little bit wanting, but perhaps you could put it down to rustic charm! The wine list was extensive and had a few favourites, and as is the norm for me, I went for a lovely Chianti. There was a wonderful menu and I was thoroughly pleased by the two courses that I had (and the nibbles they brought out beforehand). I probably didn't need to finish off the night with some grappa but I guess one must!The staff were wonderful and friendly and we had a good chat with them as the night finished. Top establishment!",

    "text": "Vasco was the venue of our office Christmas dinner last week. After a vigorous internal discussion, we decided on coming here ... and in hindsight, it was a very good choice :)Its located right at the heart of Soho, on Poland Street. The menu is not typical of the Italian restaurant chains that all of us are familiar with. The menu didn't have any pizza, or risotto ... and only 4-5 pastas. But the other, relatively unfamiliar (to me) dishes were great in their own right.I ordered a lamb starter. It was cooked rare ... pink in colour, along with some kind of leaves. Now my distaste for greens is legendary ... but the dish was prepared well enough for me to ignore it. That was a big plus.For the main course i had a preparation of grilled duck with beans. I had asked for the duck to be prepared well done, which probably contributed to the long wait for the item. It was cooked perfectly ... not oily at all. The dish was very enjoyable. A colleague of mine sitting close by had ordered spaghetti with prawns. It was fabulous, but i liked my order better. I also tried a few of the lighter dishes on the table ... baked potatoes for one ... and all of them exceeded expectations.All the food was inter-spaced by copious amounts of different varieties of red wine. I am not a wine connoisseur, so all i can say is that they were good.I became a tad adventurous when the time came for ordering dessert. I went for some grappa ... for only the 3rd time in my life. Admittedly this one was smoother than the ones i had had before, but looking back, i should still have stuck to the ice-cream.The service can do with a bit of improvement. One of our servers admitted to not knowing English at all. I failed to understand why he was in a customer-facing role then.I am not sure of the cost, but from what i remember from the menu, it wasn't cheap, but the prices weren't outrageous either. I will certainly try Vasco out again :)",

I knew she had a business lunch the other day at Vasco & Piero's, so two of us went over to the restaurant on our lunch break with a photo to ask if she'd arrived for her reservation. Paul checked with all of his employees, and got my phone number with the promise to call if he heard anything. I got three phone calls from him over the course of the afternoon, offering to check the credit card receipts to see if her card had been used there, and giving me news that he'd checked in with additional employees as they'd arrived for the evening shift.My friend, it turns out, was bedridden with a nasty cold and had her phone turned off, so everything was fine. Paul, though, had gotten personally concerned for her welfare and really went out of his way to help in any way he could. Though I can't opine on the quality of the food, the quality of the staff and management is some of the best I've ever encountered, and I wish the best for Paul and his kind and helpful team.",

Heaven forfend that I should show favouritism to someone simply because I know them - I once broke both of my brother's kneecaps to make sure I got the last glug from a particularly good bottle of Pinot Noir - but I'm an honest sort. You guys should have all the available info to make your choice. I tend to go there for occasions with my family, so I associate it with a sort of slightly genteel drunkenness. It had been a while, but we popped along last Friday, and all the memories of brilliant, authentic Italian cooking came flooding back. Vasco sources most of his ingredients from his homeland. That means olive oil and prosciutto from Umbria, the best pecorino cheese and, when the season's on, the pick of Piedmont's truffles. He makes his own pasta, which is wonderfully light and enwraps some gorgeous concoctions of meat, veg, cheese and the like. Heston-style complications these are not: each dish is minimal, with perhaps 3 or 4 ingredients to it. The flavours speak for themselves. Try hand-made duck tortelloni with rosemary, or gnocchi with crispy calamari, or the heaven-sent strips of calves' liver with onions and spinach. In between, if you're lucky, you might be sent a little tiger prawn, butterflied and grilled with a little lemon and olive oil. Or a single raviolo, stuffed with heaven knows what. If you have room for dessert, you're a better diner than I. I love Vasco's. Great occasion. Lovely man. Food's brilliant. It's not cheap, but food like this shouldn't be. Still, it's not wallet-bustingly expensive. One star removed only because it's in bloody Soho. Tch.",

The only thing i might suggest is a little background music instead of silence and maybe put a bit more space between the tables. The bartender was great and made a terrific cappuccino. Very attentive servers.",

Highly recommend!The ambience is not too noisy though the tables are pretty close to each other. They have a few options for vegetarian. You won't be disappointed. I've had the vegetable soup (it was delicious) and the spinach tortellini, I really recommend it. Sorry but Didn't take pictures...it was too good to stop and take a picture",

Ambience was just appropriately intimate and Italian, and the service was great. I particularly liked our waiter. He really went the extra mile to help split our bills and ensure everything ran smoothly. Food was also excellent. I ordered the ham and melon for starter, then prawn pasta for main. Both dishes were solid -- in particular, the ham and prawns were very fresh. I wish they had a nicer presentation, but I guess their aim was perhaps to make the dishes feel homemade-like. A few of my friends with Italian roots said they liked the food too. Definitely would recommend the place -- solid food and service for very reasonable prices!",

    "text": "I searched London in my first year here for a truly exceptional Italian meal. One would think with the proximity to Italy, this might be easy: it is not. There options, but one has to search.Thankfully, I found Vasco and Piero's. The fare here is old-world comfort food set in romantic, but relatively subtle interior. The sauces are rich, the spaghetti is cooked to al dente perfection, and the desserts...now I'm salivating. There's a quality wine menu. Not the best, but plenty of options. Some of the waiters are a bit terse, but most engender that boisterous spirit many of us have some to equate with Italians. For example: when - on arriving - I once asked how fast we could finish our lunch, the waiter handed me a piece of paper. \"Your check,\" he said. That kept us laughing through the entire meal.Anyway, Vasco & Piero's is a gem. I will keep coming back here for my carbofix as much as possible.",

I started with a roasted beet salad which was mixed with cherry tomatoes and avocado which was both visually colorful and very tasty. The whole table tried some and enjoyed. For my main course I ordered the tagliatelle ragu. The pasta was cooked to perfection with the ragu adding a perfect salty component to the dish. I also tried some of the orecchiette which was also very good. To finish it off I had the panna cotta but the waiter mistakenly delivered the panettone. He left the panettone for us to eat as the kitchen corrected the mistake and it was the winner of the four desserts we tried, though each of the others were very good. Wait staff was very friendly and accommodating, A+ dining experience and all for about 50 pounds per person including a bottle of wine!",

Great atmosphere and very tasty food, definitely one of my favourite Italian restaurants in London.In early 2014, I stumbled into Vasco & Piero's Pavilion in Soho. I found an absolutely lovely place that can be easily overlooked. I really liked the friendly staff and also the classy atmosphere of this restaurant with a lot of light and beautiful paintings on the wall that do not distract you from the stunning food. It simply was a joy to eat there.I started with a ros\u00e9 wine, something I do not drink too often, but this one was delicious and very crisp and fresh.For dinner, I ordered the very tasty home-made tagliatelle with beef ragout. Rich in flavour and an all-around enjoyable dish.The panna cotta with strawberries and, I think, caramel sauce was light and refreshing after the hearty main.I rounded off my visit with an espresso. Typical for an Italian restaurant, they serve a strong, bitter coffee. Not really the kind of coffee I prefer, but as I knew what to expect and because it all worked for me after the sweet dessert, I did not mind it.Without any doubt, Vasco & Piero's Pavilion in Soho is worth a visit. It is such a lovely restaurant - for sure I will be back for another meal soon.",

I arrived early to an unsurprisingly empty restaurant but the place what's heaving when I left.I did not think it very prepossessing, tucked away on a corner and easy to miss, particularly with scaffolding outside currently. It's small and quite unremarkable inside with simple white tablecloths and decor. Despite this there is a great ambiance and the staff who are friendly and attentive do their best to put you at your ease immediately.I had a very mediocre G&T before embarking on the wine. Don't bother coming here for cocktails. If that's your thing you need to go elsewhere. The wine however was quite good. We were recommended a \u00a340-odd from the menu whose name I do not recall but the server said it was from the vineyard of a friend of his who made his fortune in shampoo. It was very drinkable but not the best.You come here for the food. I started with the pink beef carpaccio which was absolutely delicious. My companion had the burrata and that was a bit disappointing. I've had better from Waitrose. Then I had the grilled calamari salad which was gorgeous. The spaghettini was fine. To finish we had a cheese selection which was perfect.Good atmosphere and great service.I would come back again and try lunchtime as the menu is changed twice daily.",

Mains- we went for pasta- both the other girls had prawn spaghetti, I had the aubergine ravioli. The prawn option was really tasty, the ravioli was a little bland but in all fairness I think I could have (and should have) chosen something else on the menu- there was so much good stuff on there like salt cod, lemon sole etc.... which looked lovely when they came out to other tables.4 stars for location- tick, great starters- tick, a really tasty pudding shared- tick and one \u00a0extra for good luck.
