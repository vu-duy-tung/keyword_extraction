Busy and yet fast, this resteraunt does lovely noodle dishes but be warned - it is only noodle dishes. There are hot and cold spring rolls but for us low-carbers, there's just rice noodles. One thing I loved is that it is all rice noodles - no wheat in sight which is a lovely change. I highly recommend this place for either lunch or dinner - YUM!",

Although it is small (so if you are on your own, you may well have a random at your table), and you may feel slightly rushed being there, the food is fast and always piping hot. The dishes are cheap enough to have a side and main dish (and possibly a drink that isn't tap water, which they are always fine with) for under a tenner. The dishes are also great to share with friends. I recommend any of the dishes in soup or the pad thai varieties if you are new to vietnamese food. There is something really here for everyone here, whether you are a veggie or love any type of seafood. This review is also on Trusted Places.",

    "text": "hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026 I have been rather unlucky with Vietnamese restaurants in Soho: I was not very convinced by the West End subsidiary of the the popular Hoxton Vietnamese Cay Tre and I was more than disappointed by the lack of authenticity at Pho in Soho. I was told Viet was the place to go when craving cheap and authentic Vietnamese in Soho,and,even though I liked Viet better than both Cay Tre and Pho (and it is without doubt the cheapest and most authentic of them three),I would not exactly rush back. Viet is situated on Greek Street,very close to Curzon Soho. I give you this piece of information as it is so inconspicous that I walked up and down Greek Street trying to find it and passed it several times without noticing it. (NB:I was not drunk at this occasion). It is super basic and consequently very cheap. You pay something around 2-4 pounds for most of the starters and 6-8 pounds for the mains. Alcohol is not served but for a small corkage charge you may bring your own booze. The waiters couldn't care less. If you have managed to attract their attention,they are nice enough,but in general they are not exactly the epitome of efficiency and good customer service. But now to the food:The Vietnamese summer rollswere lovely filled with succulent prawns,fresh salad and herbs as well as bouncy rice noodles. Since I have learned how to do Bo la lot minced beef wraped in betel leaves \u00a0at Leluu's Vietnamese Cooking Course,I have very high standards for this Vietnamese favourite. I found the Viet version to be nothing more than ok. While the aromatic and peppery flavours of the betel leaves were beautiful,the beef filling was under-seasoned and cried for some more fish sauce and lemongrass. Unfortunately also the two mains were predominantly characterised by their blandness. Bun cha (cold vermicelli noodles topped with chicken,bean sprouts,cucumber and herbs) would have been amazing if the massive amount of tasteless green salad would have been replaced by fragrant Vietnamese mint. Also the ginger and lemongrass chicken was stingy on flavour and was nothing to write home. There was nothing wrong as such with either of the dishes,but of all them would have needed just this little bit more (herbs? flavours? seasoning?) to convince me. I would go back if I craved Vietnamese and was restricted to the Soho location. Less than 15 pounds a head for a quick and reasonable meal is not bad at all. However,there is just no escaping the fact that for good Vietnamese,you have to go East.",

You could see the cast, leave at the half (the 30 minute window of 'me' time imposed to make sure your actors are in place for beginner's call), neck a bowl of steaming noodle soup and be in your seat for curtain.They've had a spruce up over the intervening years, but not much has changed. It's still a functional, clean little space with close set tables and an open kitchen at the back, rammed with families, friends and the occasional tourist (you are in sight of Shaftesbury Avenue after all).Pretty good fried bits and bobs I recalled correctly, and they sell the full range of Pad Thai's and hot and cold noodle dishes. On a recent visit we wrapped piping hot, blistered and teeth-sticky Vietnamese spring rolls in lettuce leaves and slathered them in Sriracha sauce, cooling our palates with freshly made summer rolls of cooling prawn and mint. As a nod to my past memories, I went for a large bowl of chicken Tom Yam soup, a heady blend of ginger, tamarind and chilli that took a sledgehammer to my nascent cold. Cheap, comforting and very, very well done.",

By that I mean, you get a heck of alot of noodles for bun dishes but the pho didn't really have alot of noodles in it, just ALOT of broth. That said, the broth was pretty rich and good. My friend had ordered that and he was very unimpressed with the portion size and also the false advertisement that said it was rare beef. The cow is WELL DONE. (Ibelieve he went home to eat a second dinner. What a fatty. LOL Joke) I, on the other hand, ordered a bun dish which was cold noodles with a hot topping, i ordered a pork topping. I figured, it's pretty good for a summer's day where it was not too cool and not too warm. The Bun dish was very nice, and the portion was massive in comparison to pho. But I did have to add alot of sriracha so maybe it's not as flavoursome as it should be. I've had better vietnamese food for sure and I told my friend we'd definitely be heading down to Deptford to get some of the real shit.",

    "text": "I seem to find myself in the most unassuming spots in London. Friends and I were going to get together before a night of mad partying in Soho... This place was suggested, I was thinking for noodles, I would have gone across the street to Young Cheung (but only because I like Chinese noodles), but Pho worked just fine with me... anyway, this place is like finding a small gem tucked away in a mess of crazy on Old Compton Street. Anyway, we step in and it's a smell of awesome vietnamese goodness that flows through the restaurant. Like others have mentioned, this place is really small on the inside and has maybe all of 10-15 tables. So, it might get crowded. Anyway, food was quick to come out and I really liked the level of spice of my pho (and added the chillies that came with the side dish of basil, bean sprouts and lime). We also had the summer rolls as well. And being a fan of summer rolls, I was slightly disappointed because they really weren't all that great. Usually summer rolls have an amazing taste of freshness... these were just meh. Fresh yes, but not bursting from the inside - I wanna shout it out loud - type of freshness. So minus points on that one. The main reason why I give it a 3 vs any other place that I rate (see other reviews) is because it's uber pan asian. We're not talking just South East Asian - but East Asian as well... I'm never a fan of a place that tries to do too much - and it proved it as well, friends had other dishes that didn't look great, and their green thai curry was definitely disappointing. Nevertheless, first Pho place in London I think, so I'm actually thinking there's probably better to come. Will I come back? MAYBE. only if I was looking for a bowl of pho in Soho with no other options that I know of.",

When we arrived, there were plenty of free tables as it was surprisingly only half-full but we were seated right next to two guys that looked equally baffled and fortunately were nearly leaving but also by the open door - which in late October is not where you want to be! Fortunately when we asked if we could move, this was fine. When our order was finally taken, we waited a while for our food - again, something that doesn't normally happen here - when my dish arrived, I had to ask where our starter was as it strangely still hadn't come! The waiter just looked annoyed at me and said yes, it's coming when my Mum's main came, and still no starter, I asked again and was again told yes, it's coming. About 5 mins later, a lady rushed out with it, so clearly they had forgotten this! All of this debacle aside, my food - Phad Thai Prawn was lovely, my Mum's was disappointing and our starter - the summer rolls were very nice but a tad overpriced for the place.Previously, I had ordered a Pho dish which I think Viet excels at and are fairly good value for what you get, though at 7pounds could be a little bit cheaper considering the surroundings which are extremely basic but clean. I, do however, highly recommend the coconut juice! After yesterday's visit, I nearly gave Viet a 2 star review but because of previous visits gave it a 3 - must try harder.",

    "text": "PHO PHO PHOI have a friend who has actually started a facebook Pho Appreciation society, pretty much based entirely around this restaurant. \u00a0The \"special pho\" is indeed quite special, and my favorite thing on the menu. \u00a0The summer and spring rolls are also both quite excellent. \u00a0I also sampled the black pepper beef udon (also very good) and the seafood tom yum, which was just ok, in comparison.This place really feels like a hole-in-the-wall spot, which is welcome in such a touristy, overpriced neighborhood. \u00a0The meals are among the cheapest I've seen around, too - 6 quid for a massive bowl of pho - can't go wrong! \u00a0And it tastes like the food is of a relatively high quality, especially for the price.The service is fast and impersonal. \u00a0I guess they're trying to get people in and out quickly, as it's a tiny space and fills up fast.If you would like ice in your tap water, be very clear about it. \u00a0Mishaps are known to occur. \u00a0Oh, and also, it's byo liquor, so if you would like wine, you have to remember to bring it yourself. \u00a0I never have and have never noticed anyone else doing it either. \u00a0I think everyone's mostly more interested in noodle-y goodness.An awesome little gem in the center of town - who knew?",

    "text": "For photo see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  Amid the chaotic clatter and chatter, waiters bump into tables and diners feast elbow to elbow on big bowls of steaming beef pho, fragrant noodles and colourful prawn salads. Best of all, it's BYO (including beer). Viet is not somewhere to go for a quiet meal. It's been our favourite local Vietnamese for years. Admittedly, there's not much competition in Soho - or indeed, many places outside of East London. The small Pho chain has recently opened an outlet on Wardour St. But Viet is no polished operation. It's quick and dirty, cheap and cheerful, and feels like a little pocket of Kingsland Rd in Soho. Soft summer rolls (goi cuon) come with prawns, herbs and salad almost bursting through the thin, translucent rice paper wrapping. Fried spring rolls are crisp, fresh and meaty. But best of all are the thin little parcels of juicy beef wrapped in betel leaf - a taste sensation. Bun sa, cold vermicelli noodles with chicken cooked in lemongrass, with crispy lettuce, pickled vegetables, cucumber and mint were, on our last visit, somewhat lacking in flavour, and a little stingier on the chicken than usual. I have my suspicions that portion sizes are being sacrificed a little here to keep the costs so low. The noodles come with a side bowl of nuoc cham (fish sauce, zingy lime juice, garlic, chilli, sugar), essential for pouring over the mix. Most people come for the pho, the comforting, spicy, noodley broth, which is slurped up hungrily, even as plates of starters and drinks arrive at their tables, apparently out of sinc. No one seems to mind. Extra fresh chilli and other bits are provided on request. A personal favourite is the beef salad - slithers of beef with chilli, onion, lime, Vietnamese basil and smashed nuts. It's full of flavour, although the portion on my visit last week is (again) smaller than I remembered it. Corkage is apparently charged on wine (about \u00a33) but the bottle opener for our beers was unceremoniously plonked on our table last week and we drank without charge. This is one cheap night out. Starters are often around \u00a32-4, and the average price for larger dishes is around \u00a36-8. Service is sometimes erratic, but never bad on my visits (I'm not expecting Michelin star service here), and the young guy who coordinates it all is smiling and helpful. He doesn't miss much when it comes to pointing out who needs what and when. Viet's popularity means there are often queues on Friday and Saturday nights (some resort to cracking open their beers in the line), and you can't reserve ahead. So get there early, and tuck in.",

Even though the tables are close together you don't feel crammed in or lose privacy because there is so much going on. If your really lucky you may even see some lovely looking dancers from Priscilla Queen of the Desert having a break at the stage door of the Palace Theatre.What is really great about this place is the food is quick, simple and tastes great but what's even better than that is you can take your own wine with a small corkage charge of about \u00a32.I would recommend having the Thai Green Curry.",

I order the seafood pho, which tastes fresh considering the seafood is probably frozen.The only thing that annoys me about this place is having to loiter in the tiny entrance whilst the staff ignore you as there are no tables. It is literally like pot luck, you can either walk in and be lucky enough that a table frees up within five minutes or just hang around with no indication that you are going to get a table, let alone be acknowledged. Once seated, they're fast and efficient and they're not short of business. Once a table is free, people just always appear at the right time to take it.Some of the dishes can be quite greasy, but on the whole, the food is good and the atmosphere quite busy and bustling.It's not the prettiest place but it ticks all the right boxes where needed.",

Starters are about \u00a32-4 and mains \u00a34 - \u00a36, not a fan of deserts so cant really comment. Food is fresh, tasty and is perfect for a tasty meal before night in town. Its BYO (bring your own), not sure if they charge for this. Well worth a visit next time your thinking what a poor selection of restaurants there are in China town (ok ok theres about 3 that are worth a look but the rest are best left to the tourists!)

They nice and simple and the grilled pork was tasty.I had bo la lot and a banh xeo. The bo la lot was good but i prefered when they are a little bit grilled or oven baked so there is less oil on it. The banh xeo was crispy and I like that they use chunks of porc instead of mince pork as some cheapy places do.So overall ok but not an HQ for Vietnames food",

Perhaps, it's a forlorn hope after the great pho I've had in the USA but hope springs eternal.The name Viet Pho promised much and I liked the more local neighbourhood feel to the place despite its proximity to the tourist heartland of Shaftesbury Avenue and Chinatown. However, my heart did drop slightly when I heard Chinese being spoken in the open kitchen.The restaurant was quite trendy with funky giant lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling.The menu was largely Vietnamese based with some Thai interlopers.I started with summer rolls, which arrived immediately. Obviously pre-rolled, they were fresh tasting as I arrived just after the restaurant opened. These were great, with the fresh vegetables and prawn wrapped in rice paper tasting super fresh on the palate. Dipping them into the dipping sauce added a nice sour piquant kick.I followed this with special pho, which meant that I got all the accompaniments - meatballs, beef, prawn. It was good without being outstanding. The broth could have done with more depth. This was served authentically with a plate of beansprouts, Thai basil (also know as holy basil) and chilli to pop into with some srirachaThis is a good spot for some off the tourist trail good filling grub",

I didn't like that they put dark meat chicken in the soup because traditionally it should be white breast meat from the chicken. I enjoyed my bowl, it was a good portion for one person, and I finished the entire thing. A bit pricey, \u00a37 for a bowl which converts to $11. In the States, \u00a0a bowl of Pho is supposed to be very affordable, about $5.50. Not bad, but not the best.

    "text": "Love this place. First time stopped pre theatre for bun cha, one of my favourite dishes. Despite being crowded, we were seated right away and food came quickly. Bun cha was perfect.Second time stopped for pho. Special pho with chicken, Vietnamese sausage, beef and prawns. Great fragrant multi dimension flavour soup stock with beansprouts, thai basil, lime and chili slices to add.A great find in Soho, quick, efficient, reasonable value and very good.",

    "text": "I love this place. It's the closest I've found to the Vietnamese stand-by I left behind in Philly.Let's break it down.Food? Very tasty. Limited menu, but consistently good. Could do with bigger portions of herbs.Value? Excellent, especially for this part of town and for a big, tasty bowl of food for about a tenner.Get the b\u00fan (not a bun) with grilled pork. Share a side of raw (rare, really, though I wish it was raw) beef salad and the excruciatingly piping hot ch gi\u00f2 (you will burn yourself with the first mouthful, inevitably; just wash it down with some coconut drink). Enjoy the laid-back ambiance and, if you're lucky, get told how to season your food just right.Best for lunch, just try to avoid the full-on lunch hour rush by popping in a little early or late.",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to some good pho considering the winter weather and the reviews on yelp. Disappointed doesn't begin to describe my experience. When I walked in the restaurant was pretty empty--this was probably a sign since it was past noon. The pho was so terrible for so many reasons. First, the soup base was awful. It was salty and had no depth. Second, the noodles were atrocious. The average length of my noodle was about 3 cm. I feel like they probably just gave me the scraps left at the bottom of the noodle package. Gee, thanks. Third, the sides looked old: bean sprouts were not fresh and the cilantro was withering. Maybe some of the other dishes are decent but I definitely won't be back to try. The best thing about a place with crappy food is that you'll always get a seat so come here if you need to rest your legs and you don't mind eating bad food.",
