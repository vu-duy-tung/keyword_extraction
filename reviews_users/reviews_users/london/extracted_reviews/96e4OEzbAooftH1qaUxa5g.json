I just adore this pretty, unique coffee place and it's warm, inviting feel.The only food I've ever sampled is crumpets with marmite and unfortunately they were so cold by the time they got to my table that the butter sat on top in big un-melted blobs, thus robbing me of the usual drippy goodness one expects from crumpets (hence the missing 5th star).However, as I may possibly have contributed to the temperature loss by choosing to sit outside on a less-than-sunny day, I am more than willing to visit again for research purposes and amend my review if necessary. I may even give in to a slice of one of the delicious looking cakes upon the counter if it means I can better advise others - such is my selflessness.",

Their daily fresh soups with bread and butter are always hearty and the range of cakes from the Artisan bakery are to salivate over.

Those tables outside are some prime people watching real estate, let me tell you.I'll always love coming here for a tea or coffee. But call me a tea snob, because I'm really not that impressed with their tea selection here. They have a good variety but to be honest, none of them really sound very good.

Often I find that coffee chains make very weak coffee and I am usually disappointed. But not here! The coffee is of a good strength and if you ask for a double espresso that's exactly what you get. However you can queue for a while - so do be patient. The best thing is you can sit outside, people watch and absorb all the energy of the area. I love ordering crumpets with honey, sitting back and watching the world go by. Alternatively inside is like sitting in someone's farmhouse kitchen.

I personally think the reviews are kind of deceiving - we arrived expecting a posh little English pub for dinner and it turned out to be quite the opposite. We went down the road and found a restaurant that met our initial expectations and then returned for some low-key drinks. This is the equivalent to most Irish pubs in NYC - not much decor or ambiance, lots of beers and ciders to choose from... all you need is good company and you're set!",

It was very basic, but intimate, and especially for a Friday evening after work: relaxing for a drink.I barely hang out in hipster Shoreditch but I do plan to come back to this bar and maybe try to food next time!",

Even though I worked in a coffee shop for three years and can apparently make quite the cappuccino, I struggle to drink more than a mouthful of the stuff before my face screws up and the gag reflex kicks in. Charming I think you'll agree. In spite of this however, I spent the majority of my university days sitting in coffee shops with friends pretending to study. What was I to do if I was going to fit in? How would I achieve acceptance from the cool kids if I wasn't knocking back espresso's and discussing bean blends? It was during these dark days that I discovered my love for all things tea related. The Market Coffee House makes the perfect cup of tea. With upwards of 15 different varieties, this is proper tea as God intended. Firstly the pot arrives, leaves swimming at the bottom. Then the waiter presents you with your strainer and milk and the challenge begins to brew and dilute until you achieve the perfect colour of brown. Delicious! Thankfully The Market Coffee House doesn't stop there and offers a great selection of cakes and biscuits to accompany this brew. Sitting at one of the shops mismatched wooden tables felt so homely that I couldn't resist dunking my sophisticated dark chocolate and almond biscuit into the tea. Maybe this wasn't what the maker had intended for this beautiful creation but take it from me, it's a marriage made in heaven. Oh and I hear they make coffee too...",

Having tried the house white, we decided to try our luck on a bottle of their Gew\u00fcrtztraminer from Alsace (~ \u00a330) -- sensational!The starter menu felt quite limited if you weren't interested in seafood. The mains menu made up for that with game, fish, pies and decent veggie options on offer. For starter, we ordered the deep-friend oysters to share -- good but the side sauce was a little sweet and a tadge too thick. For main, my friend ordered the venison saddle and I ordered the guinea fowl. The venison was to die for.. melted in your mouth. It would have been even better if the sides were more complementary (they were spinach and wafer thin potato lattices). My main, the guinea fowl was good, but was smothered in a gloopy gravy sauce that just had way too much cornflour in it. We also ordered a side of chip wedges (fabulous!) and dessert (good but not memorable -- literally!)The service was generally very good. The only caveat was being interrupted every time our glasses ran dry to be asked whether or not we wanted our wine topped up -- with a bottle sitting at the table, the answer was always going to be yes!For one starter, two mains, one dessert and a bottle of wine the bill came to about \u00a3110 (including a 12.5% tip). Somewhat pricey for the quality of the food, but we had a good time and would return.",

    "text": "Thank goodness they're open later. We needed to grab dinner after leaving the Dennis Sever House, and knew that if we hopped on the underground to head back towards our hotel, we'd not be able to find a place open that late.The bartender was very friendly, and recommended a stout for me to try, which I appreciate. He said it'd be better than Guinness, and laughed when I gasped at the audacity. The beer was good, I'll give him that, but better than that Irish stout? I don't think so.We were both pretty famished by this point, so we went with a starter and an entree each. I ordered the soup of the day (which I was told was a roasted carrot, but which tasted very potato-y), and my husband tried the devilled whitebait. For our mains, I ordered the mussels and my husband ordered the pie of the day, which was steak and kidney.The soup - definitely not carrot - had really good flavor. It was served with a thick slice of bread and was warm and tasty. The mussels were perfectly cooked and definitely filling. The chips could've been a bit more crispy, but were still a nice side.My husband and I honestly didn't know that \"devilled\" means something different in London than it does in the States. When they brought his plate of devilled whitebait out, I immediately knew he wouldn't be a fan. I'll give him credit for giving it a go, but he didn't eat much.Same thing goes for his pie. He's not really a fan of gizzards, and he commented that the iron-y taste of the kidney was pretty strong, but he did end up enjoying the pie and got his fill on that.The bartender did stop by a couple of times to make sure we were doing okay, even though we had a waitress who was taking really good care of us. He stopped to chat and make sure I was happy with the beer, and to check if I was interested in trying another of his recommendations (which of course, I was.)This was a great random find in a neighborhood that was new to us. Had we been in the area again later in our trip, we definitely would've stopped in again.",

This is a really cool spot and very original. Inside is full of wood, pews and booths. Its adorable, quiet, and a dining experience that's unique and provides some privacy will getting that real English Establishment feel. The bread pudding was absolutely delicious. Decadent, rich, creamy and gooey. You can't ask for anything more from a bread pudding, and this filled my quota of cream and butter for weeks (but it was worth it). I cant vouch for the food but the dessert and atmosphere made this a fun stop!",

I didn't expect to find a French inspired menu or such a great wine list because of the name. I went with the set menu and a half bottle of wine. The amuse Bouche was a wonderful Salmon late. Lovely and delicate flavors. My appetizer was a crab cake, crisp, with spinach and hollandaise. My entree was very good as well, steak with frites and b\u00e9arnaise sauce with Dijon dressed greens. Even the dessert was phenomenal, bread pudding. I'd recommend this place to anyone.",
