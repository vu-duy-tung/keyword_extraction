The menu is full of rich ingredients like rabbit, game, lamb, chicken all done in a variety of good curry sauce bases. An interesting selection of fish and veggie options too. Didnt like the poppadom at the start as these werent fresh. The dips that came with them were also bland. I had the lamb shank which was tender and full of flavour and my friend had the seafood curry. At \u00a318 a plate for main course, this is expensive but by the looks of it there will be some discount on the food.",

A haven for the media moghuls and rich tourists the Fort is well looking into-if only because of its elegant and sleek water feature and antique artefacts. The menu leans strongly towards North Indian Classics and select dishes from the regal kitchens of Lucknow. Hare Kebabs starters-smooth patties containing smooth spinach puree sharpened by piquant mustard greens followed by a satisfying chicken dish cooked with fresh mint,coriander and green chilli paste hit the right spots in the mouth. There is a good selection to choose from for all palates because Indian food does not have to be chili hot to be enjoyed.",

The service too was shocking.

We ignored the walk advice but after being in a cab in that area for 10 mins we got the message and walked. Red Fort was far from what I expected it was sumptous inside, great staff, very friendly and accommodating. They brought us drinks while we struggled on what to get from the menu. When the waiter came back we were still undecided. I asked him if he would pick for us and my crew agreed to give it a shot! It was SO worth it. We had the most amazing meal - the appetizer sampler was delicious. The tikka salmon was probably the best piece of fish I have ever eaten. We then had some Lamb Kofti, Chicken tika masala (by special request) and two veggie plates - and a naan sampler (the naan was good not super) but everything else including the wine pairing was stupendous. A meal I will not forget it and I will return to the Red Fort next time I am in London.",

Wines starting at well over \u00a320 a bottle One thing I learned from going to India - and eating in places like VJs in Kilburn, is that Indian food is often at its best when it is simple and dirt cheap. Ok, this place is not a curry house - it is an upmarket restaurant - and the quality of the food was excellent. The mixed starter which we shared was really wonderful - interestingly flavoured meat, fish and vegetable and all with lots of chilli which I really enjoyed. And the mains were good. But not spectacular. Service is fine but nothing special - and the 12.5% that is added to the bill does seem a bit much especially when the bill is already so high! I'm not sure I'd come here again - if I was going to pay that much for dinner I would want to go somewhere I thought the money was better spent.",

We had a great Stellenbosch cab -- highly recommended if you're looking for a bold and well-priced wine that can stand up to spicy food. If you'd like to try some variety, the starter plate is a good way to go and feeds two. There were some surprising dishes that I would never have ordered that ended up being fantastic, such as the spinach and cheese patty and the mushrooms. Try each dish with each of the different sauces.If you like spicy peppers, you'll love the eggplant. My favorite vegetable dish was okra with asparagus.They have a pretty wide range of desserts -- the next table got the fruit plate and it looked amazingly huge and fresh -- but I was too stuffed from the other food.Gluten-free notes: If you stay away from the naan, there isn't a lot that you can't eat. Even the pappadams they bring at the beginning of the meal don't have wheat (checked with the chef on that one). Enjoy!",

You might be able to deal with the spices, but the check might make you shed a tear. \u00a0This is not your 9.99 Chicken Tikka Masala. \u00a0But for a special Indian treat, I think it's worth it.",

I tried the grilled and curry infused lobster, which was interesting, but too pricey to be repeated. The standard curries are good, but not particularly interesting or exceptional. You definitely want to try the creative foods that you won't find at the more traditional Indian curry restaurants, say like a Punjab or Tiger Spice. The ambiance is fantastic, a great place to take a date to or for a business dinner. With a glass of wine, starter, a main, a veggie dish to share and naan and rice, it was about 30 quids a person.",

I opted for a lamb bryani (super generous portion - I wish I ordered it to share). By far the best food I've ever experienced.

I've only been once, and the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived for our reservation, but quickly filled up. We had the soft shell crab as a starter, and I got the slices of duck breast as a main. We also got the rice & breads to compliment our meal. My friends got some curries (I forgot which) and they liked them but they were fairly standard. The soft shell crab was pretty delicious and the duck was good although a bit heavy in sauce. We took our time and never felt rushed. Some of the menu items are a little pricey, but not terribly so. Overall, a good place to have dinner. I think the downstairs is a lounge; it looked like it was starting to get pretty packed by the time we were leaving so that's probably something worth checking out for next time!",

My father and I stopped in here one Saturday evening for an early dinner and were seated immediately. First thing you'll notice is that the decor is very serene and upscale. Upon being seated, we were greeted promptly by a very nice waiter who dropped off some tasty papadums & chutney and went over some of the menu options. They have a Chef's Tasting menu for 45 quid that looked fantastic, but we decided to create a tasting menu of our own. Every single dish we ate was fantastic and the two of us couldn't stop talking about how amazing the flavors were. We ordered: SALMON TIKKA - Scottish salmon marinated with mustard, ginger & garlic, seared in tandoor \u00a39KOTHMIRI SCALLOP - Scallop tikka marinated with mint, coriander & curry leaf \u00a312TEEKHAY ALOO - Baby potatoes tempered with chilli, mustard & poppy seed \u00a37MURGH BEMISAAL - French corn-fed chicken tikka breast pieces in a mildly spiced clove, herbs & tomato sauce \u00a318DUMPUKHT BIRYANI - Welsh lamb & Basmati rice with spices, steamed in a sealed pot \u00a320Everything on the menu looked so good, and the great thing is that none of the dishes were really your traditional items found at run-of-the-mill Indian restaurants. They all had a unique twist to them. The flavors of the herbs and spices really were marvelous. The only downside was that for \u00a320, the servings were a little small, but we didn't really care. Total bill was \u00a3110 for 2, which isn't half bad for the quality of meal we got here. I highly recommend this restaurant. The location in Soho is great. The decor is wonderful. Staff are friendly and accommodating. And the food is absolutely stellar. Highly recommended as a date place as well!",

    "text": "I came here on the recommendation of the concierge at my hotel.+1 for bottled Kingfisher, but -1 for the Voss bottled water (strange to have fancy Swedish water at an indian place... doesn't Kingfisher make bottled water too. =p jk!)I started with the pear salad.. WOW. \u00a0this is a delicious combination with almost a full pear sliced thinly + spinach + balsamic. Totally not very indian, but amazing none the less.The saffron rice was mediocre but was a good base for the amazingness to follow.The dal was nice but on the thicker side than I like, but I fell in love with the Okra (bindhi). Yum Yum Yum!After a big meal, of course I went for dessert. The mango kulfi was delicious and helped satiate my stomach and cleanse my palette.The ambiance here is amazing, and the floating flowers and candles in the basins of water is a beautiful touch.#Vegetarian review",

The dishes are just like I remember the Indian food in the better restaurants in India.For example the Bhalla Sev Puri starter is a very Indian vegetarian starter. it is some kind of dumpling with yoghurt and puffs filled with potato, mint & tamarind chutney and it was really great, as was the seekh kebab (clearly non-veg).As mains we shared Chicken Tikka and a gravy/tomato sauce chicken dish Dum Kha Murgh with some butter naan and I loved it. Being a kind of fancy restaurant we had an excellent wine with the food.I guess this is not the most economic Indian restaurant in London but off course you can consider yourself warned while entering through the door covered in Michelin stickers.",
