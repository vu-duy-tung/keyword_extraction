There are a few tables outside, which is great if you can nab one on a summer's day. But as with all the places on this square, you have to get here early if the sun is out, so take an early lunch break as lots of people will have the same idea. It's like the tardis, because inside is much bigger than you'd expect, with bags of seating and more tables at the back. Reserve a seating area if there's a bunch of you meeting \u00a0the raised mezzanine area is best, with big old leather chairs and sofas and a low coffee table. An eclectic style of furniture, but comfortable. Unfortunately the food menu isn't very imaginative and doesn't seem to change very often. I wish they'd invest in a decent chef here. They don't seem that bothered about catering for vegetarians either. And even though it's an open kitchen, they won't adapt any of their dishes to make them vegetarian if you ask. It's a shame, as otherwise it's quite a nice bar.",

YES. the happy surprise? for a bar, their food is actually pretty awesome. i had this 'salad' which was actually a bed-of-mixed-greens-showcase for the fattiest trio of products ever to come out of a kitchen: pork belly, crunchy black pudding, and poached egg. YES PLEASE. on my other internet sojourns, i had a not amazing but decent goat cheese and grilled veggie tart, and my companion had a fish and chips. it didn't blow my mind, but the 5 pound lunch special pricing did. can't comment on the bar scene, but if you're a hungry person in search of free internets, zigfrid is your new friend.",

Maybe they have to contend with a busy place but its still no excuse to be rude and confrontational.The bar does get busy and this can mean it can get very crowded - great when your in the mood - but the problem with this is the bar service. If you can squeeze into the bar you need to contend with getting served - a situation that shouldn't normally be a probelm under normal circumstances - but I don't believe the Bar men and women know how to effectively judge who should be served next and when it comes to speed of service - probably the slowest place in Shoreditch - not great when your thirsty. Good vibe - just a shame about the bar service and the worst bouncers in shoreditch.",

The old worn in armchairs and low carved wood tables are the ultimate cosiness wanted on a Sunday afternoon hangover. You can order yummy chips, burgers and even seafood (if you can stomach them) and sit back relax and read the papers or just stare out the big glass window on the facade of the venue.Conversely, Thursday, Friday and Saturday are pumping. Always a little queue. Note for the men, pair up with women in the queue subtly as the bouncers can be quite sexist and not let groups of men in. Loud music plays with artistic, slightly alternative video clips or movies playing. Usually packed, so crowds of people standing everywhere - all floor space is covered. They serve food till 10pm which is delicious - burgers, chips, tapas and even the mixed nuts you can buy at the bar are great!Downstairs is a club playing a range of music. The air conditioning is always on quite strong - so get dancing! Be aware that there are separate toilets for men and women but shared basins and mirrors.Definitely a place for a night out or an afternoon chilling. The outdoor area is heated and can be covered in when raining.",

Perennially busy due to the heated outdoor area at the front of the venue it is especially busy on summer evenings once the sun has set and you're bored of sitting in Hoxton Square! Another highlight is that food is also served here until well into the night, with a full day/evening menu that includes pub grub usual suspects (Burgers, nachos) and, randomly, oysters. A late night menu with mostly sandwiches is also available into the small hours. However prices do start from around \u00a38 for a veggie option rising to \u00a310-\u00a312 for your meaty main, so fairly expensive for a bar but food is of a good quality and you can watch it being made as the kitchen is open. The furniture adds to the ambience, with antique chairs and sofa's scattered around for you to sit and watch the action. Come weekend the club downstairs opens, with a modest entry fee of \u00a33 it attracts a different, younger crowd than the post-work weekday drinkers. Worth a visit for the story of the place if nothing else, you go and pose with the Hoxton trendies!",

Unlike many of its neighbours it hasn't chosen to go for the stark minimalist look and you feel like you can actually relax without your presence messing up the place. I like the mismatched furniture and odd lamps, even though it's still very stylised it seems to have a lot more soul.Last time I was here my friend and I went to town on their cocktail list and though I can't really vouch for the later ones, our Mojito's and Caiprinha's were very good. On the other hand, the house white was shocking and served in warm glasses. Avoid it if you can!The music at Zigfrid's is what really seals the deal for this place in my mind. I don't think I've heard the same style twice but whatever has been playing, hip hop, punk, ska or soul, it's always been upbeat and got people up and dancing. Even the coolest of Hoxton kids can't resist tapping their toes to R-E-S-P-E-C-T!",

None of which strayed from the norm at Zigfrid Von Underbelly.

The food isn't fussy or extra special, but what it delivers it does just as you'd want - amazing pizzas, generously topped nachos, and a Ziggy burger that is out of this world. They also have some nice ales from Hoxton brewery nearby. From the outside it might look a bit dark and more like a music venue, but there's actually a cool eclectic vibe to the interior that makes it fun to sit and catch up with mates in.

The stage was a small, with red curtains and a carpet. Its a medium sized place, with DJ on right side of the room, and one round table to put your drinks on. Their a couple of pictures around the wall, quite similar to a Shorditch bar, with that look.The bar was long, my only critic would be its a Saturday night, and they only had three people behind the bar and the place was packed. I was waiting to be served for about 20mins not good. My shandy was \u00a33:70 which is not too bad.The outdoor area was great, anything that provides outdoor heating is excellent to me.The restrooms mirrors and sink basin's were unisex, and pretty big, great for putting the touch up makeup, and nice not be squashed, like you have in some places. Inside the toilets you have a drink stand, which is always helpful, never seen that in a toilet before.The Underbelly had a great vibe,especially if your seeing a really good band, I don't how it is on a night with no band, but hey that's another review.

From the white picket fence on the outside to the money tree on the inside, Zigfrid Von Underbelly is closer to a modern art exhibit than a pub. The live DJ mixing at this trendy spot will keep your feet moving all night with a healthy mix of house music. Many artists, musicians and followers of fashion congregate here. There is also a stage for live gigs and large couches and Victorian chairs to lounge on. You can come dressed low-key or all dolled up... anything goes!",

    "text": "Tucked away in the corner of trendy Hoxton Square is Zigfrid.Zigfrid is my favourite bar in Hoxton. It manages to pull off cool, cutting edge, homely and rock chic with aplomb. The leather sofas and high backed chairs for some strange reason remind me of the Matrix. It also pulls off a vampire vibe without being to alternative.Music ranges from alternative to pulsing electro beats with the odd eighties hit thrown in.The after work crowds cram in early evening then slowly makes way for the more serious party people later on. With Underbelly downstairs where you can rock out till late, Zigfrid can be used as a launch pad for a hedonistic evening.Bar service can be slow and the gastro style menu could offer more variety. The outside patio is spacious and will be great when summer comes back around. For the Hoxton area Zigfrid is a must hit bar",

    "text": "A good bar in the corner of Hoxton Square, which on weekends can get quite crowded. The Front of House management has always been polite and no snobbery displayed, which is a real plus these days. It is advisable however to get there early though, to avoid any disappointment in terms of queuing. The decor is quite arty, but has been mentioned by Howson, you do get the feeling the bar doubles up as a strip of fly catcher with things easily getting stuck to it and other things. Not a real problem though as you are too drunk too soon to really take any notice of that. There are lots of smaller areas with tables that allow for groups to meet up and mingle, so the issue of 'overcrowding' is a small one. The venue, when busy, does promote the making of new friends by making it quite easy to talk to other people - the girls being quite approachable. There is a club in the lower ground floor as well as live dj sets being laid on in the bar on the ground floor. Good quality music which suits the vibe of the place. Drinks are averagly priced with lagers, wines, spirits but no ales on offer. Shots are available for those who like to crawl home. On the downside, the male toilets are perhaps a little bit on the small side, considering it tends to get quite crammed and it serves food. An issue with any one of the toilets being out of action may easily cause Glastonbury style queues perhaps. There is a small decked and covered area outside the front for smokers to mingle and share those over the cigarette conversations. The staff have always been attentive to my needs and I haven't really been made to wait for too long. Having said that however, it does get busy so you have to be on your guard that no queue-pushers get in before you. On the occassions that I have been there it has always been a good night out, challenged only with the thought of having to get back down south whilst being slightly trashed with the longish trip home.",

The bartender didn't know what I was talking about. Not a great sign, but such is the way of a bar loaded with teenagers ready to pull pints. Very cool clientele, I feel like sitting in the back would be optimal, checking out all that's going around you. Fly place. nuf said.",

And unlike quite a few places in the area, it feels very genuine rather than what often comes across as over-done, artificial hipster quirkiness. Definitely A+ for effort on the decor and vibe!Great concept which uses the top part as a restaurant/lounge/bar and the downstairs (Underbelly) for gigs and other local artists.There are surfboards on the ceiling, dusty-looking armchairs, with carved wood tables, and heavy curtains partitioning the areas. Oh,and don't forget the buffalo skull. The Underbelly was just right for our company of 6 or 7 people. Although it was busy and the music is loud, there was plenty of breathing room and we even found places to sit; however, we were there on a weekday both times. Prices are fine for the area and it's open late so definitely a good Hoxton destination post a late-running work party or for a drink with friends.Looks like they do some great local musicians downstairs which often don't have a cover charge so will have to check that out (along with the food) next time we are having a late one nearby.",

I've experienced better. \u00a0I found this place fairly expensive. \u00a0I know shoreditch is a pretty expensive place to drink, but I thought that the prices given to me at the bar is more than I'd expect. \u00a0Also, I was wary that the bartenders were making some mistakes with pricing. \u00a0A friend of ours bought 2 drinks, a gin and tonic and a beer...but the price the bartender gave my friend was for a double gin and tonic and a beer. \u00a0I know mistakes happen, but there is a pretty big price difference and if you're not careful or paying attention, you could be paying way more.I ordered only a side of fries, and it took ages for it to arrive. \u00a0It was relatively early on in the evening and the bar wasn't so packed. \u00a0So I'm not sure why it took so long. \u00a0But they did come hot and very salty. \u00a0It was not served with ketchup, but with sweet chilli sauce and mayo. \u00a0Tasted pretty good...but anything tastes pretty good if you're hungry!Lastly, the main reason why I didn't like to drink here was that seating arrangements were rather uncomfortable. \u00a0The tables would be set quite low and you would sit on small stools. \u00a0Some tables were old barrels, so there would be loads of stools crowded in a cornered barrel. \u00a0The way that the seating was set up would actually make you very slouched and it was uncomfortable to sit and chat with friends.Perhaps I'm being a bit finicky, but honestly the seating arrangements at this bar was so uncomfortable. \u00a0If you were going to be there for a couple drinks, it's great, but the fact I was there for the entire evening was just physically uncomfortable. \u00a0If this place had more comfortable chairs or sofas, I probably would have given this place a better rating...",

Considering I had nothing better to do on that particular Saturday night in London, I have to say I had a good time. Got there early and it was easy to get a beer, so I ended up chatting with my bartender who was from Budapest where I spend most of my time. She had no Hungarian beers, so I had a Czech beer. Expensive in my world, but decently priced in London. It got pretty crowded later, not sure if that's normal for a Saturday, but not too busy that I couldn't deal.

After a trek through what seemed like miles of corporate buildings and track homes from London's touristy center, we finally reached the one bar I had decided I had to visit on the trip, and I was ready to complain about something. Really, anything. My feet ached. I was hungry. I was thirsty. I was carded for the first time ever in London. But the moment I stepped into the dimly lot Zigfrid von Underbelly, I forgot about all of that.The interior has a cool mismatched vintage vibe, and the crowd on a Sunday night was just as diverse. If you're going to order food, find your table and then order at the bar - they'll ask for your table number, so have it in advance. We cashed in on the happy hour specials and tried a couple of their cocktails which were both pretty good. I had the chicken burger, which wasn't bad. It was your standard bar food, but prepared well. What really sold me though was the atmosphere. The bartenders were really friendly and since it was Sunday, they were attentive as well. The armchairs are the comfiest armchairs I've ever sat in, and overall, the bar has an unpretentious, yet cool vibe to it. Definitely the highlight of my trip to London, and I only wish I had a chance to go to one of the shows here.",

The space itself is super cool, like... super cool, it's a nice place, and also like, super cool, it's so over-the-top indie-hipster mania. \u00a0For instance, they had an older version of Alice in Wonderland playing... with Dutch subtitles... backwards. Right. \u00a0But it's quirky, and if you are a hipster (admittedly or not), you'll feel pretty awesome sitting at a corner table looking at the weird collection of junk on the walls. Add in decently priced drinks, a decent draft selection, and good music... it's a good choice if you're in the area (and the area's a good choice if you're looking for a place to head out for the evening).",

    "text": "A shoreditch classic! Quirky decor, interesting concept, unusual drinks (and okay cocktails) and completely rammed on the weekend. I walked into this place on a Saturday and nearly walked straight out as there wasn't space to breathe. However being with a group it was hard to motivate others to leave We managed to find a space by the bar, and I have to say the music rescued the night. What fantastic tunes! Not the best experience ever, but great times with friends and a very late license made this a good night.",

    "text": "Recently went here for a private party with open bar. The venue knew there were more than 100+ guests expected but only hired/brought in 2 bartenders. Needless to say it was chaos. The bartenders seemed to be lost and stunned and didn't know how to deal with the crowd.First off, I blame the manager for not bringing in more staff. When we went upstairs to complain, the manager actually swore at one of our party using the F word. Needless to say, we'll never go back and I would highly recommend not hiring this venue for future parties.And did I say the manager on duty was an ass? Abysmal.",

    "text": "On Fridays and Saturdays, this place is a sweaty mess. If you know New York and you just can't get enough of Joshua Tree and BAR XII, then this place is for you. It's not, however, for me.I give them a second star on the presumption that it might be much nicer on weeknights when less crowded, and because drinks are reasonably priced.",
