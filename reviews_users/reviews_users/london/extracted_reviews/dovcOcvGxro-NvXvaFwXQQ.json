We actually had to point it out for him to stop.Secondly, the horchata drinks were too watery.Thirdly, all the food was bland. In fact, our favourite dish, the Sonora salad, we had to actually refuse to pay for it. That was a first for us.It would be a real shame for someone to come to this particular branch for their first Wahaca experience. It is simply not good enough. In fact it is awful.Go to Wahaca in Soho or in Covent Garden instead.We can't help but think that Wahaca is spreading itself too thinly, expanding way too fast and at the cost of high standards. A shame.",

It is normal that each person in the party pick 2-3 small plates and share, making the options for your meal almost endless. The flavours are fresh and they have fun combinations of different foods. The menu is seasonal as well, so there's always something new to try. Definitely recommend! I've had their tacos, tostadas, quesadillas, taquitos and their guac, and all were delicious! There are many options for vegetarians as well.",

We had some small plates as well as larger dishes. The chicken empanadas were good. The wings had good flavor. The chicken burrito was gloppy and overloaded with off-tasting spices. The guacamole was made from old avocados. You know the taste - musty and gross. Chicken taquitos were greasy but okay. The queso fundido was disgusting. It was a dish full of grilled peppers, tomatoes, and onions with a bit of cheese melted on top, plus some outrageously spicy sausage bits on top, piled high with chopped red onions and cilantro. I adore queso fundido, and this was an abomination. I suppose if one deliberately misspells Oaxaca to be cute, one who patronizes such an establishment should expect to be deliberately cheated out of authentic Mexican cuisine. Go down the street to Fire House. You'll be grateful you did.",

They have a fair amount of vegetarian options and a selection of drinks, including a range of tequilas and a few aqua frescas, including horchata. They do small tapas-like sharing dishes, nibbles and full dishes. I got horchata, guac and chips, plantain tacos and blank bean burritos. It only cost me \u00a313-14. All of it was excellent, but I found the tacos a little too spicy for me. I like the option of small dishes because I usually like a variety of tastes and because I'm small, so full-sized entrees are usually more than I can handle. You also have the option to pay by app. I think for the quality and variety of food that this is really good value for money. I ate at 4pm, so it was nice and quiet and the service was good.",

    "text": "I don't understand marketing the overt cheap-chain feel to Wahaca. From the buzzing light transponders that they give their guests in queue (as if the host could not just walk over to the bar to tell you that your table was ready) to the interesting spiel given with full inscription on your menu/place-mat. Do they sing for birthdays too? Our waitress was muted in a sea of outside voices and if not for her drawings on our menu/place-mats as well as our pointing to menu items and nodding, we would have been unable to communicate. Still, I'm not even sure of a single word that she said.That aside, I was whet with anticipation over the responsibly sourced food we were about to consume, despite the over sized dining room, with over sized voices. First round, we split the Guac + Chips and the Frijoles + Chips. Both were very decent, obviously fresh made, and nothing to complain about for a starter snack. We washed these down with a Classic Marg and a Wahaca Mule. I can't speak for the Margarita, but their take on the Moscow Mule subbing Tequila for Vodka is delicious!Wanting to make it simple with all the confusion over pre-ordering instructions and what was offered for specials etc, we kept it basic and went with the tacos, beef and pork. - The beef was a bit dry, lacked enough chipotle salsa, and the uniquely lightly charred cheese was off-putting - The pork was not quite moist, but unfair to call dry. \"Special Yucatecan marinade with fiery pickled onions\" - yeah... fiery? no. special? ok.Both needed heavy doses of sauce and less cook time. Having been to Mexico, lived in Guatemala and Miami, and visited the SouthWest US Wahaca is not bad, but it's not great either. Kudos on the sustainable sourcing but I would really appreciate the experience more if I felt like I wasn't at one of the cheap establishments that are all too many in the US. This is not a theme park it's a restaurant. All in all, I would dodge it if I was hungry, but I wouldn't brag about it to my friends either...",

    "text": "Distinctly small supermarket sarnies on a square plate.After seeing the reviews here on yelp, I had hoped I would be in for a treat. \u00a0Instead I've had better lunches out of a packet from M&S.Although this lunch was sans wheels, (I'm normally with my offsprog in a pram cos I'm not hipster-mum enough for a sling), the first thing I noticed was just how inaccessible this place is. Not only are there stairs down to the venue, the hand rail is unreachable due to the various shrubberies that line the stair case. Now I'm not exactly a monkey, so I could only just about hold on to the hand rail to totter down in my interview shoes. Inside the acoustics were terrible, probably due to the low ceiling and abundance of metallic interior design. What should have been fresh and summer decor felt like an abandoned Mexican playground with some tables squeezed in. Badly. Our waiter, while nice enough, was really mumbly. It seemed to take forever to find dairy free, which still had to be checked. My poor vegan friend was nearly with out choice. I ended up having a special, a winter steak sarnie... Only it didn't feel that special. The kitchen forgot to remove offending milk products, so I had to wait while my companions ate. It was a thin piece of frying steak that was only just about pink. My vampirism was not to be satisfied! Plus the sandwich was the size of my hand with some miserable tortilla chips, dolefully splattered with some sort of watery tomato salsa. My spicy slaw was ok, but I really like raw cabbage, so it couldn't really fail. The hibiscus mojito was delicious... But sadly so small that it was gone in seconds. Poor vegan accomplice had a winter vegetable burrito, which really was just a rice and mushroom wrap. A real shame she didn't like mushrooms. Even more of a shame were the fried sweet potato. The nicest food one the table and if there was any more than half a potato in that terracotta ketchup pot, then you can tell where you found it please. We didn't even entertain the thought of pudding. We paid the bill and decided gin was a much better option and headed for the near by and delightful Scooter Caff\u00e8. Seriously, rather go to M&S, get 4 times the amount of food and eat it in a park where I can hear my friends and avoid depressed nacho chips.",

    "text": "Let me be clear from the start - this is a review based on an attempt to eat at Wahaca in Waterloo. We did not end up having a meal there because of the outrageously rude host and hostess. In short, we put our names down for a table and went outside, armed with a pager to alert us when our table was ready. After about 20 minutes, the pager starts to buzz. Five minutes later, we approach the host, who informs us that he has given our table away due to our FIVE MINUTE lag. When we protested, suggesting that five minutes was not nearly a sufficient amount of time to justify giving our table away, his response was: \"You admitted it took you five minutes.\" Yes, we did admit it took us five minutes, which seems like a more than reasonable amount of time to hold a table (especially for a group that is in possession of a pager...it's not like we put our names down just to score a useless pager and then walked away). Moreover, we were never alerted that we had a three minute window between being paged and approaching the host. Having eaten at other Wahacas, I can attest to the fact that the food is mediocre. But with service like this, I can see no justification for giving this restaurant (certainly the Waterloo branch) any future business. You're better off heading to one of the new burrito chains that are popping up all over London.",

I've eaten at the ones in Stratford and Canary Wharf, but tonight was my first time eating at Wahaca in Waterloo. I brought my entire family to try it for the first time but the hostess was not friendly at all. She told us we would have to wait 1 hour and 20 minutes for our table and so I gave her my name and we went to walk around Southwark. About 20 minutes passed and my little sister said she needed food and couldn't wait any longer. I told her we could eat at the Wahaca food cart outside and then go back to the restaurant in time for dessert since I had been talking about the chocolate and the churros for a long time. We ate our burritos (which were tasty) and killed some time so we could have our dessert. We went into the restaurant when the time was right and they seated us right away. We told them we wanted to see the dessert menu and our waiter brought the menus out to us and then told a co-worker, maybe a manager, that we just wanted to order dessert and not food. Next thing I know, he came over and told us that the tables we were sitting at were only for people who wanted to have a meal. He told us that we should not just go into the restaurant to have dessert, even if we were waiting for an hour and 20 minutes! He said that this was the only time they were going to let us have dessert and to \"not do it next time\". It was absolutely ridiculous and I was so angry it ruined my dessert! He had no right to tell us what we could order and couldn't order. I couldn't believe how horrible the staff were after I had had such impeccable service from the ones in East London.",

    "text": "Wahaca is one of my favourite restaurant chains, both for their delicious food and fun atmosphere. The restaurant itself is very colourful and modern, which I think helps improve your mood and get you excited for the cocktails and the food.You can choose between smaller dishes to share or regular mains for each person, so it's great for groups and people who would like to try out a few things, and everyone else of course. Another thing I greatly enjoy is that the food itself is tasty with great flavours but the mild food is actually mild. I am not a fun of very hot foods and this is exactly the level I like. However, my friends who love hot food were also happy with the level of spicy that the spicy dishes were at. So no matter what your tolerance is, you will find something for you.I'd recommend checking one of their restaurants out and ideally going later so you can then stay for more drinks. Dinner before a night out would be ideal!",

    "text": "Wahaca manages to achieve the almost impossible mission of success without decline. Each branch that opens has a slightly new take on the bright Mexican street food eatery selling healthy South American tapas and the best tequila in town, all at mega affordable prices.  I have never had a bad meal or a bad margherita at Wahaca. These guys know what they're doing. Whether it's a crunchy chicken ceaser tostada, a crispy sweet potato & feta taquito or a delicious pork pibl taco, the mini dishes are a dream. Load up and enjoy! The bigger dishes are great too, whether you're into fish tacos, burritos or a salad where you can literally eat the bowl, it's all great! Make sure you start off with THE best guacamole and chips, and end with the decadent churros with chocolate sauce to complete your Wahaca experience. And don't forget the tequila! This location is nicely hidden away and so should be easier to find a seat!",

This branch is conveniently located opposite Waterloo station and right near the Old Vic.Inside we always have the same minor trouble - the seating is rather crammed in and the lighting is a bit dim. Our waitress today was good even if the person taking us to the table was a little surly.But onto the good stuff - the pork pibil tacos today were fantastic, and I love the chicken taquitos. But one of our favourites is the sweet potato sides - they're so good that we can't share and have to get a portion each now! We decided to try the steak burrito as well, and were very pleased with the quality of the steak.Another great feature is the quick pay system. Using a QR code on the table and an app, you can pay over your phone meaning that there's no need to wait for the bill to arrive.",

They even have habanero salsa on the table so you can heat it up more.Bottom line, I'm from Texas and eat TexMex at least twice a month and I found the food at Wahaca to sufficiently spicy and tasty. The only minor point I have is that at the height of rush-hour on a Thursday night, I found the basement setting to be a bit loud. That was offset, though, by a strong sustainability vibe which I enjoyed (for instance, quirky matchbooks to plant growing guerrilla chillis in the city) and free wifi (which for someone traveling without a data roaming plan, is extremely helpful).Highly recommend.",

My dishes were all packed with flavour, fresh ingredients and presented nicely! Only downside I can think of is that dishes arrive to the table as and when they are ready - on a table of 4, this can get a little cramped! Also have a separate specials and gf menu, so dont forget to ask for these! Overall I will definitely be returning to Wahaca.

    "text": "Wahaca is my favourite chain of sit-down Mexican restaurant in London. Sure, there are pricier options with more authentic flavours like Lupita (yelp.com/biz/lupita-lond\u2026) and faster more affordable choices like Tortilla (yelp.com/biz/tortilla-lo\u2026). But I think Wahaca offers delicious Mexican food at a mid-range price point.***I came here with two friends sometime during the opening week. The restaurant was still short staffed, and the staff was obviously still getting used the new setting. My friends and I were seated immediately, but we sat at our table for a looong time before the waitress (yes, the one waitress) attended out table. She was out of breath, rattling off the specials at the speed of light, sweaty, and clearly exhausted. Pobrecita!Other than the slowness in service, the food was delicious. We ordered the chips and guacamole, fish and chicken tostadas, and sweet potatoes on the side. The kitchen graciously re-fired a dish for me that conflicted with my food allergies. The restaurant's bright interior creates a delightful atmosphere for a fun meal. One of my favourite features is the sink at the entrance that ensure that you don't get a mouthful of germs with your quesadillas! ***NB: I mean, it's still over-priced. Americans like myself will always think that Mexican food is over-priced because we can get authentic Latino food for cheap in States. But, all things considered, Wahaca is affordable for London Zone 1.",

After having the sweet potato and feta taquitos, I knew they were going to make a repeat appearance in my life. Their winter vegetables burrito was pretty tasty, and a different combination of veggies than usually included! It also came with a side of tortilla chips of the perfect thickness. The drinks menu is actually great and not that expensive. They had a special - the blood orange margarita - which was so tasty we ordered an entire round. They have a number of vegetarian dishes, but I believe the meat and fish are all sustainably raised. After years of avoiding Wahaca because of its reputation as \"commercial Mexican\", I've completely changed my mind and am ready for a return visit.Update: second time, and Wahaca still doesn't understand \"no beans - I am allergic\" despite having a \"tell us about your allergies\" statement, so I'm deducting a star.",
