After finishing our bowls we were pretty much forced out of our tables after 1 hr to accomodate those waiting despite telling us in the beginning we had 1.5 hrs! Very disappointed with this service and not returning again if they want to operate like a Chinatown restaurant. You cannot bring a check without the customer asking for it!",

    "text": "The pho here is really, really good. But it's a high-quality bowl rather than the huge bottomless soup heavens I'm used to sticking my face in. It's expensive. But it's good. The broth is flavourful and drinkable. The meat is obviously great quality, the rare steak is very tender and the other fatty cuts are a dream. But the noodles are the real star, they are hands-down the best pho noodles in London. Soft, slippery, bouncy and chewy! The holy grail of noodles and on my mind almost constantly since my last bowl. The only thing - the bowls could do with more of them! The fixings on the side were plentiful and good quality, no Thai basil though and lemon rather than lime. Also, the bird chillies come whole. I have never encountered this before! I think the idea is you put the whole chilli in the broth and get the flavour that way? But I'm a freak that likes to actually eat the chilli so I tore mine up (with my fingers - do not rub your eyes/nose/anything after doing this) and added it that way. It was spicy and awesome but maybe Cay Tre should just cut them up?We experienced none of the service problems I've seen complained about on other reviews, but it may be because Wednesday lunchtimes aren't exactly the busiest, or, possibly they've finally been open long enough to straighten everything out (it really has been ages)? The decor is pretty fancy but I liked it! My only complaint is the portion size (just not big enough) and the fact that bottled beer (Saigon, the only choice) is \u00a34 a pop. You guys gotta know I hate my overpriced booze.It's my birthday this week and I think I'll be back to try the 'Special Pho' because nothing says \"celebration\" like 500 grams of meat!",

    "text": "Vietnamese Cuisine has a secure place in my top 5 cuisines in the world and I am a regular visitor of Little Vietnam in and around Kingsland Road. Cay Tre Soho is without doubt an interesting addition to the Soho dining scene, where Vietnamese restaurants are scarce. However, compared with my favourite Vietamese joints in the East End and also compared to the original Cay Tre in Old Street, I liked the food substantially less. Overall it didn't deliver the fresh flavours and herb explosion that I find in my favourite Vietnamese eateries such as Song Que or Fernandez & Leluu Supperclub. We started with the Green Mango Salad (8.5) which came with dried shrimp and knotweed. I a sucker for Vietnamese salads but this one was rather mediocre. It didn't taste as fresh, zingy and herby as better specimens of this kind. The Grilled Aubergine (6) however, despite being a particularly unattractive plate of food, was utterly delicious and for me the winner of the evening. The sweet taste of the aubergine together with the ground pork on the top worked so well with the flavour of the fish sauce. Very nice indeed and a must have if you like aubergine. For the mains we went for the very healthy sounding Mushroom Hotpot (9). The menu stated it would come topped with crispy tofu. The flaky thing on the top that you can see here was actually pure garlic and I hate garlic in large, overpowering quantities. Apart from the missing tofu and the garlic overkill, the mushrooms were plentiful and nicely cooked. The Softshell Crab Curry (8.50) sounded intriguing. It turned out to be very heavy and also surprisingly spicy for Vietnamese food. It almost resembled an Indian curry lacking the subtle flavours of Vietnamese cooking that I like so much and replacing it with a hammer of ground spices. I nevertheless quite enjoyed it and thought that the little vermicelli dumplings for dipping the sauce added a nice touch. Where Cay Tre Soho wins is with the atmosphere which is about 10 steps up from East London Vietnamese places. Rather stylish with dim lighting and friendly as well as efficient service. While I was not blown away with the new Cay Tre, I should mention that some other food bloggers whose opinion I rate highly really loved Cay Tre Soho. The London Eater recommends to try the Pho with Ox Cheeks and Greedy Diva highly enjoyed not only the Chef's Vinh Beef. Have you given it a try yet? What did you think?

First impressions were all positive - they've done nice work with the decor and minimalistic, but surprisingly comfortable, seating. I particularly liked the half-booth tables for large groups, which suited our group of 7.I was forewarned that the menu was a bit pricey for lunch - particularly as there was no price difference between ordering certain dishes at lunch or at dinner. This was a bit disappointing as I understand the Shoreditch branch does have a lunch special. Saying that, the food was delicious, the portions were decent, and everyone was happy, even though we had some people with very particular tastes in our group. There was one comment that the pork 'tasted a bit like kebab', but I was assured this was in fact a compliment (from a kebab-lover). It had a good crowd for lunch so there was a good atmosphere but I was again a little disappointed when the staff failed to say goodbye or thank us on our way out (I thought this was me being picky as a former waitress, but another girl in our group pointed this out).I'm going to go with the 4 stars because I think they're still getting their feet (customer service wise) and if I just had more money, I'm sure I wouldn't have noticed the price!",

The rolls are a bit hit and miss, as are the soups, but there are so many good meat and fish dishes on the menu you won't be disappointed.

    "text": "Here's what I said back in 09 about Cay Tre's original location on Old Street: \"Best Vietnamese in London? Maybe.\" I reckon the same could now apply to the restaurant's new Dean Street location. A starter course of grilled calamari with okra rocked, especially the grilled bit as there was just enough char to the bacon-y chunks of squid to have me daydreaming of exotic barbeques in balmier climes. And my main course, of Lang Son spinning roast Tamworth pork belly (stuffed with sweet curry leaves from northern Vietnam's Lang Son province, roasted with lemon and honey then served with dried shrimp chilli oil) was one of the more delicious and intriguing pork dishes I've devoured in a very long time. Both starter and main were fiery yet held delicate flavours. Since my visit, I've heard from a few friends they're not that impressed. I must admit though I really enjoyed dining here and only regret was that I wasn't with a big group of foodies keen to order and share a variety of dishes (but I will be back!). If you like the Old Street Cay Tre, I can only imagine you'll approved of the new Soho version as well. And if you love Vietnamese food but for whatever reason found Old Street's ambience or menu lacking, it might be worth your while to check out this new and more centrally located Cay Tre. The design and feel of the place is a little slicker and a lot airier than the original while the menu presents a fresher, spruced up take on Vietnamese cuisine.",

They said the beef wasn't cooked enough and the soup was not hot enough - which it should be so that the meat sizzles when you put it in. The meatballs were not cooked enough so that my friend wouldn't even be able to eat them. They forgot to bring the basil, lemon and soy sprouts that you usually put in your Pho yourself on three out of four orders, which we kindly reminded the waiters of. There wasn't enough Pho spice in the soups so that they tasted like nothing.. There weren't enough noodles in the classic and meatball Pho. All noodles were broken into small pieces which is not the way it should be. I found a hair including the root inside my soup. Shit happens but in this case it is simply neglectful of the restaurant not to have the cooks wear nets. The good thing is that the waiter did come to my table to apologize for the hair and of course I didn't pay for it. The ceiling fan was directed at our table so that we were cold and sitting in coats. The interior is nice though.",

My girlfriends main wasn't brought until 20 mins after mine by which time I'd finished. People rave about this place, but to me, this place is teutonic, uncomfortable and overpriced for what you get.

It just wasn't what I was expecting, somthing sticky, charred and unctuos. In fact lukewarm food was a theme of the evening, not sure if that's how it's supposed to be served. My soft shell crab curry came with one teeny tiny crab floating in nice curry sauce and my friends shaking beef was just (admitedly soft and tender) very plain beef that didn't taste like it had been marinated in anything and the dipping sauce on the side tasted like pure soy sauce. It just didn't have the punch and flavour I was expecting from my travels in vietnam, maybe we ordered the wrong things but still.",

    "text": "This restaurant has a lot going for it, and a lot of work to do to really stand out--especially at the price points it's charging. If I had to sum it up in one word? Inconsistent.Let's break it down.Shrimp/sweet potato fritter: Quite tasty, actually, but it came as a daunting, large briquette cut into four large pieces, with a tiny bowl of nuoc cham to go with it. Something like this should really be either bite-sized or thin enough to easily make bite-sized with chopsticks; this sucker would have needed a knife and fork to be eaten with any degree of civility. Wrapped in lettuce and mint and dipped in nuoc cham, it was definitely pleasant, but could have been heavier on the shrimp and lighter on the batter that held it together.Steamed rice pancakes with pork: Good, homey, and pleasantly bland; this dish is meant to be all about the texture, with a little shot of filling, and that's what you get. The small portion was certainly a good value.Spring bowl with crab: I wish I'd had what my partner ordered! The crab 'spring rolls' were delightful, moist, and well-balanced, with a good amount of crab meat. The vermicelli bowl itself is big, but putting nuoc cham on it already is a little weird--why would you put it in the bottom of the bowl for me? And seeing as she kept stealing bits of my mint leaves, her bowl lacked on the herb department.Vermicelli with hanger steak: Disappointing. The steak was utterly flavourless. I was hoping for a hint of char-grilled flavour, some lemongrass and ginger, garlic, anything... nope. Bland, somewhat paltry portion of unseasoned steak, 'helpfully' tossed with a tremendous amount of red Thai chillies. Were those supposed to make up for the lack of flavour in the beef? The noodles, veggies, and herbs were all in their rightful proportions (could have actually been heavier on the bean sprouts and herbs), but the bland meat, lack of spring roll slices for texture, and (again) the weird thing about nuoc cham at the bottom of the bowl made this a flop, especially for the price.Vietnamese coffee with macarons: Overpriced, and the coffee didn't taste particularly fresh.We dropped a fifty on what would have been, back at my favourite Viet haunt in Philly, a $25 lunch. Yes, London; yes, Soho. I get it. But seriously, if you're going to be charging that much money for what is simple, inexpensive-to-make food, the quality has to be there, and the flavour profiles have to be authentic. Cay Tre has some good foundations in place; now it just needs to find some heart and make a serious go of it.",

    "text": "I'm still sticking on 3 stars overall. \u00a0My latest trip here as part of the UYE (thanks Yee Gan!) brought me the best bowl of pho I've had in London, hands down. \u00a0However, this was also an evening trip. \u00a0Now, I'm no stranger to loud noises. \u00a0I used to do rifle shooting. \u00a0I go to a lot of extremely loud gigs (2 hours of Melvins' two drummers will deafen you for about a week). \u00a0Yet I found the volume in Cay Tre really, really uncomfortable. \u00a0The acoustics in that place can only be described as \"bathroom\"; I struggle enough as it is to pick conversations out of the background and at times I kind of had to give up talking and bury my face in my soup. \u00a0I mean, how else d'you think I managed to finish a good 5 minutes before everyone else?The pho is great. \u00a0I went for the super bumper combo deluxe complete with about 5 different parts of cow (I love my tendon) packed into an oversized bowl brimming with a deep brown soup topped with a glistening sheen. \u00a0I mean, I could right haikus about this.Deep, brown, delicious,Bold, fragrant, steam shimmering,Get in my belly.The broth is by far the best I've tried here, absolutely brimming with flavour yet still extremely fresh. \u00a0The assorted meaty chunks are great too, the tripe isn't tough, the tendon is rawr, and the muscly bits are tender and tasty (the meatballs too are perfect - great texture). \u00a0My main negatives were the slightly overdone noodles and the absence of cut chillis (mine could have done with a bit more spicy kick - the provided uncut chilli isn't quite potent enough). \u00a0The massive bowl is \u00a314 - almost twice the price of some of the Kingsland Road joints. \u00a0Pricey, but given the sheer volume, it's great. \u00a0I mean, sure, it would cost (at most) 100,000 dong, but the quality of the soup and ingredients is undeniable.",

    "text": "My friend took me to C\u00e2y Tre especially to try out their Pho. When we looked at the menu there were no Pho listed. After we had our food, we found out that the waiter did not show us their Pho menu!!!!!We ordered Tiu Bowl (chicken, charsiu pork, beansprouts, peanuts, Pho Noodles, tangy sour sauce) for \u00a310.00 and Saigon Stewed Pork Belly (caramelised coconut juice, hard boiled egg) for \u00a310.75. Tiu Bowl tasted bland. I was expecting the extensive use of fresh herbs, spices, and aromatics. But none, which was a disappointment.As for Saigon Stewed Pork Belly, they used pork chop instead of pork belly! The pork chop was hard and dry with a part of a vertebra in the middle. I am no butcher but I do know pork cuts well. Pork belly is juicy and tender, showing layers of muscles and fat without vertebra or bones in the middle!I would not recommend C\u00e2y Tre if you are looking for an authentic Vietnamese restaurant that offers mind blowing dishes with fresh herbs, spices and aromatics. Remember, you have a choice and can always choose a better Vietnamese restaurant!",

The restaurant itself is very nice and clean, not a traditional hole in the wall pho joint, much more upscale. (this is Soho after all)The broth was great, the meat was great, and the service was good. It was a little bit expensive (in the US you never pay more than maybe $13 for pho), but I suppose that's the norm in this part of town.All I had was the Saigon pho which I found to be fantastic. I would definitely go here again.",

    "text": "Thumbs up to one of the best Pho I have tasted in London - classic rich and refreshing broth with flank steak. Totally yummilicious.....They do charge extra if you want other parts (e.g. meatball, tripe, tendon or shin).  Another one of my favorite dishes (if you are an aubergine fan like me) is the piggy grilled aubergine. Is it just me, but the word \"piggy\" sounds rather unrefined in a dish's name. It is basically a whole aubergine steamed in fish sauce garnished with mince pork. That was the first time I had something like that. Totally mind-blowing to dig into a softly-steamed aubergine.The chili salt and pepper squid was good - just the right amount of garnishing and mixed pepper batter. A bit pricey, but would be a luxurious once-a-month treat.I have also tasted their cha la lot (betel leaf wrapped pork dumplings with mashed peanuts). To be honest, I wasn't too impress. The flavor was there, but probably doesn't sit well with my liking.I am a regular patron (1-2 a month), and they fare very well in terms of consistency of their food.",

I've had the pho and the bun cha here and both dishes live up to what they should be. More recently, I've had the bun cha - the meat is flavourful, the spring rolls are crispy and the overall dish is deliciously satisfying. Be careful on weekend nights when the restaurant can be extremely loud so could make conversation a bit difficult. But I've also been here during lunch on the weekends and during the week for dinner and it's a much more pleasant experience.",

    "text": "Vietnamese. In Soho! What's not to like? Well... Though a good effort I think I will still be going to Kingsland Road when I crave Vietnamese. That said, Cay Tre is not bad, it's just that I expected more. The BBQ pork with rice vermicelli was the highlight for me. It's a dish I really enjoy which probably brought the score up a bit for me. It is very nice but it lacked the strong BBQ flavour I'm used to when ordering this dish. Apart from that it was well made. I definitely recommend this. The cat fish with caramelised fish sauce was OK, nothing spectacular. The fish flavour was very strong and sometimes almost overpowered any other flavour. Com Saigon (grilled pork chop with a fried duck egg) was nicely cooked with an interesting flavour but was quite dry and slightly bland. Trying to even out all the meat with a vegetable dish wasn't the best idea. The string beans were merely beans with garlic at a price far above what it was worth. Overall, a good place to visit if nearby but otherwise I'd stick with Kingsland Road.",

The decor inside of this location is decidedly more upscale than its Old St counterpart, but the food is just as delicious. I ordered the plain beef pho, which came with fresh pho noodles (better than any of the other options I've had in London) with an incredibly delicious broth and tender beef. The crab summer rolls, filled with mint and lime, were delicious as well. The restaurant also seems to offer affordable and exciting meal deals.Just talking about it makes me want to go back again, and the lucky thing is that this branch isn't located across town!",

What you have here is a cool restaurant with staff that are much more attentive.Starting this review with the desserts, as that's by far the most important aspect of the meal, Cay Tre offer ice creams made by local ice cream parlour Gelupo. These aren't Gelupo's normal flavours. No, these are special Cay Tre flavours like Vietnamese Coffee and Vietnamese Basil, and boy are they good.The rest of the food is also absolutely delicious and expertly cooked. They are also pretty reasonable in price, particularly when you consider this is Dean Street and they could easily get away with being a bit cheeky with the prices.Service has never been a strong point in Cay Tre. In fact I kind of enjoy their indifference sometimes. Here, however, they are definitely making a bit more effort here. They're by no means perfect but, as I said, Cay Tre has never been about service.This is definitely now a go to place for a light meal in Soho.",

I have tried many Vietnamese restaurant in London including the popular ones near old street station, but cat tre soho got it best. And the big pho combo was BIG, humongous in fact. It used to be 12 quids but they pushed the price up to 14 now, slightly disappointed.We tried other dishes too, like the \"steam pancake?\" (B\u00e1nh cuon) was also nice, my boyfriend loved the Hanoi mixed pork vermicelli (b\u00fan cha H\u00e0 Noi), so much he couldn't stop talking about it on the way home.If you're in the mood, try their Lemongrass ice tea. I know it sounds weird I thought so too. But the first time we tried it it was sooo good and refreshing, it came in a big jar you can share between 2-3 people. But the second time we came back, maybe because it was very late (10.30pm), the tea was just like normal tea...with ice. A bit of a hit and miss actually.But over all great Viet restaurant, we enjoyed the food there and it's in soho so better location (IMO) than east end as you can go somewhere else (movies, clubbing etc) within a few mins walk.",

    "text": "I haven't been to the parent Cay Tre in east London but I was excited to see an outpost of this famous Vietnamese restaurant open on Dean Street.It's a challening location for a restaurant with several restaurants having met their demise on this location in recent years. I'm not sure why Dean Street in general does struggle to attract dining custom in comparison to neighbouring Frith Street, which thrives with Arbutus, Koya and Barrafina all doing good business. However, with Ducksoup, Tonkotsu and now the trendy Burger & Lobster opening on this street, perhaps, things will start to look upThe publication of Time Out's list of the best 100 dishes in London 2012 gave me another reason to visit when it listed the beef pho at Cay Tre on that list. Like a lot of my friends in San Francisco who have been trying to eat all 100 dishes on the 7x7 best 100 dishes in San Francisco, I may now have another excuse to eat out more!Yelp buddy Kevin L joined me to experience the pho at Cay Tre. I pigged out with the large combination pho, which had everything from all cuts of beef to beefballs to tendon.I love noodles and the essence of noodle soups likes in the broth. On this count, Cay Tre's is the best I've experienced in the UK - deep rich notes of beef which comes from long simmering. I kept slurping away at the broth even when my noodles and beef was all goneThe beef was nice and tender. I think my favourite was the brisket and I love that you can get tendon in London. The English tend to be a little squeamish!I've since been back to eat here again. The summer roll and Chinatown pho weren't quite as good as the beef pho. However, I'm letting Cay Tre keep their 5 stars for having the best beef pho I've tasted in the UK",

We tried a few places before settling on Cay Tre but as you can imagine everywhere in Soho on a Friday night had at least an hour wait. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table at Cay Tre but sipped on some interesting and quirky cocktails at the bar in the meantime. The bartenders were very friendly and put a lot of love into each drink. Once we were seated we decided to split a few appetizers and 2 entrees. We went with a traditional Pho and the Barbecue pork vermicelli bowl. For appetizers we got a few veggie dishes which I can't seem to remember. The reason that I have blurred out the other dishes is because of the incredible mind numbingly delicious Barbecue pork vermicelli bowl. It was without a doubt one of the best things I have eaten in a while and the 3 of us couldn't stop chopsticking away at the nearly empty bowl. For dessert we each had Vietnamese iced coffees which were incredibly tasty! I wish I worked nearby because that would be the perfect afternoon pick me up!",

I booked for group of 12 for my birthday and had to call many times to keep changing reservation and depositing more money to hold the table each time a new guest RSVPed. Fair enough, they want to make sure we show up, however even after re-confirming that day via phone, like my 60 pound deposit wasn't confirmation enough they did not have the table ready when I arrived on time. \u00a0Furthermore, half way through visit they took one of our tables away and squeezed us all together even though I booked and paid for 12 people and the place wasn't full yet. We basically had to flag down the waiter and beg for order to be taken as we had to make a theater show. The food came out quickly and was good but again had to beg for the bill. Overall the service was disorganized and it made my birthday more of a hassle to plan there, than the experience was pleasant being all scrunched up in tiny table. They didn't do anything like a dessert for my b-day either but maybe that's an american thing. Would perhaps try the food again but with so many competitors, not sure I'll chance the spotty service.",

Our first impression on arrival was hardly positive, and in hindsight we should have trusted our instincts and walked out after having to wait over five minutes before anyone took notice of us.Finally allocated a table, we were guided to the back of the 'steaming' restaurant (more reek than aroma),and \u00a0before we've ordered I'm thinking about my next visit to the dry cleaners.Odours aside, the interior is snazzy, modern contemporary, unfortunately the food is not as impressive, nor was the service on our visit. As it transpired, the crowds were here more for the prices than the food. As soon as we've placed our order, the waiter asks if we're using a Groupon voucher. What a way to cheer you up before you start eating, he might as well have asked us if we had a 50% discount voucher or if instead we would be paying Silly Prices.. 'Silly Prices Please!'....That's not to say we didn't whip out our iPhones and see if we could bag a deal list minute on Groupon, alas the deal had expired, and the reduction was actually 60%! Oh well... we were here now, so we decided to carry on...It quickly dawns on us, perhaps due to the Groupon deal, the restaurant is understaffed and waiters overstretched. Service goes from bad to worse when our neighbours start to loudly complain how they have waited over an hour for one starter. The Manager comes over to try and calm the situation, and for the rest of our meal Mr and Mrs Complaints seem to have all the staff in the restaurant waiting on them hand and foot.On the other side a table of two get up to walk to the bar to pay (after waiting over twenty minutes for the bill). To be fair, our wait is not so bad, half an hour and our starter arrives, but they forget our drinks which really should have arrived long before. Our deep fried tempura shrimp is burnt on the edges; but worse, fried with its shell on, almost impossible to eat. We're left with napkins full of shell...smooth..When they do bring the drinks, the bottle of tap water is missing. The mains finally arrive, but they forget the rice. By the time it arrives, our food is verging on cold. Unfortunately the mains did not manage to save the day, my okra and aubergine curry was literally swimming in oil, a sludgy and unbearably spicy affair. This despite there being no spice indicator on the menu or a forewarning from the waiter.My partners Calamari dish was better, but nothing special. The house lemonade was akin to watered down squash. We ask for the bill and they make no attempt to offer us dessert or ask us how our meal was. Perhaps they are fed up of the truth. a 12.5% service charge is added to our bill, for the first time in living memory we decide not to pay this, get up and leave.",

LITERALLY THE PERSON BESIDE YOU CAN'T HEAR YOU WHEN YOU'RE TALKING LIKE THIS IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE IT IS SOOOOOOO LOUD!That being said, here are the positives, and why I'd likely be back for more of the craziness above:- The pho was amazeballs. \u00a0Like seriously some of the most delicious pho ever. \u00a0And the bites of some of the apps I tried were totally yumtastic too.- Air conditioning! \u00a0Blessed sweet, sweet air conditioning amidst this London heatwave! \u00a0Nectar of the gods!Thanks goes out to Yee Gan who organized this UYE solely because I said I wanted pho and that the ramen club should branch out.",

On my latest visit yesterday, I ordered the Gia Lai Pho, which is served in two bowls - one with Pho noodle, sauteed ground pork, hoisin and herbs, and the other with beef ball and brisket in fragrant Pho broth. The portion size was much bigger than I expected - two huge bowls were placed in front of me, and they looked good and appetizing. Also good value for money as it costs the same as a normal bowl of pho.If you don't eat beef, like my friend who was dining with me that day, they also have chicken pho options which are just as tasty.We also shared a Xeo Pancake which came with chicken, shrimps, and kaichoy leaves to wrap. The pancake was thin and crisp, I preferred this version compared to the Korean pancake version which can sometimes be quite heavy.If you're craving for some Vietnamese, this would be a good place to look as it's also conveniently located in Soho. It can get quite busy during peak hours though, so be sure to get there early to avoid the queues.",

I know there are other people out there who only consider hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurant with no non-Vietnamese customers as measure of quality pho. Oh and the menu must also look like a dog chewed it out with stains all over. If a restaurant needs to fancy up certain cuisine and up the quality to charge more and have the \"stuff\" to support the higher price, I say all the power to them. For me, paying a bit more to eat in a clean, well-appointed space and wait staff that are friendly (and not throw food at me) is well worth it. Yes the menu is a bit over the top and the dishes are a bit more expensive. But this is soho in London!I say if you are in the neighbourhood give it a try!",

The Iced Coffee is amazing and the Chilli Salt & Pepper Squid the best I've ever had! We also had a classic Pho and Bun Sa. Just writing about it makes me want to go there again!! Try it!!",

And I think Soho is just one of those areas that is on a par with New York in its queuing for food vibes.We eventually got a decent corner table, if rather close to our fellow diners. I had crispy pork belly with plum sauce, my pal the chicken curry. I didnt care for the strong peppary coating on my pork, although I enjoyed the crunchy skin. The curry was well received. We then polished off an unctuous - read mmmm - choc fondant with coconut ice-cream. My glass of malbec went down a treat too. I'm giving this three rather than four stars due to the queue and because it wasn't particularly cheap. I would go back again though to try the pho and some tempting rice-wrapped rolls.",

    "text": "After living in Vietnam for over a year I was happy to try this place out to see if it could help my yearning to go back sickness. Having lived there I can't help comparing the food to actual Vietnamese rather than western restaurants which, without wanting to sound like a know it all, haven't been up to scratch in my experience. Cay Tre is a busy spot and most groups will have to queue to get a seat. My friend and I must have got lucky as we got a seat straight away by the window (a great spot to people watch). Its loud and busy in here, so don't expect a quiet meal. The staff do there best to keep up but you can see its a bit of a struggle. That being said, they are friendly and as responsive as they can be. My suggestion would be to keep the front door area as a bar / waiting area that I have a feeling it was originally intended as. I'm glad I could sit and eat there, but those standing in a queue out the door could of been better accommodated with a cocktail at the bar and possibly a seat. Now the food. Quick disclaimer, I'm a vegetarian which most non vegetarian vietnamese restaurants will struggle to cater for taste wise (all too often have I had tasteless broth with soggy tofu). Cay Tre didn't let me down. I had spicy Bun Hue Chay, with both soft and crispy tofu. Would I of raved about it in Vietnam? Probably not, but I also wouldn't of been disappointed. My friend had Pho with chicken and enjoyed his portion too. And a note to other reviews I see below - Vietnamese cooking is very regional. To criticise a place for using mint in their Pho is just plain wrong and I saw it used in many, many regions. I imagine its hard to nail down a particular style in a Western restaurant when trying to cater for everyone.Price was good. Yes, I would of been shocked if the price had been one tenth of what it was if I were back in Vietnam, but I have to accept that I'm not anymore! But less than \u00a330 for two with beer and service in Soho seems pretty good to me.",

Pricing is surprisingly reasonable for a place that looks like it is priced above an average Vietnamese restaurant.There is a decent range in the menu so whether you're new to Vietnamese cuisine or whether you're trying out something new, there will always be something out there for you. Some of the dishes look a tad experimental, or perhaps, fusion. The set dinner is not a bad deal both in terms of the price and volume, and the variety. Waiters are friendly, but not necessarily helpful. Some of them seemed new to the place and even somewhat clueless as to what was on the menu. The Pho is delicious, I would say better than the one at 'Pho'. The meat is fresh and the broth is spicy and refreshing. The portion size is big, a big too big I would say (we all know that the broth will fill you up). The drinks menu is not bad either. Cocktails are well mixed, the list is fairly diverse and there are enough wines on the menu to keep you going.In spite of the fact that the place is always packed, there will always be room for you. This is a big positive for the Soho Cay Tre restaurant, where other Asian eateries will give you a lot longer wait time. The flip side is that the relatively large seating capacity results in a fairly noisy space and that's just the price you have to pay for the other positives.",

And on my list of such places, Cay Tre is right up there. I only ever pop in for Pho and can't comment on anything else but OOOOOH THE BROTH - hearty, rich and beefy (and maybe a little sweeter than I'd like) but still so so good. Halfway through the meal you look at your bowl and notice how the soup's surface glistens, and you smile, thinking oh yessssss, fat is flavour.We decided to try the 'add-ons' this time round. The option to add Chinese 'you tiao' (fried dough) threw me off a little (that doesn't seem very 'authentic' but I wouldn't know..) And for \u00a32 you only get two extra meatballs :( They're good - firm with little spots of melt in your mouth goodness but idk if they're worth a pound each :(((( Their tendons were a real surprise though! I'm not usually a fan - so often they're crunchy and bitty and unpleasant overall but ahhhh these had that magical QQ quality! Soft, gelatinous, not so much chewy but has good 'bite', a little tasteless, but boy has it made a tendon convert out of me!The restaurant's quite loud and service definitely could be better (it sometimes takes a while to get their attention) but the long and short of it is that I've been to Cay Tre many many times now and I'll keep coming back! I've also heard good things about the other dishes, maybe next time we'll give them a try.",

The \"24-hour\" beef broth was flavorful and wasn't overly fatty. I liked the flat rice noodles and the medium rare beef slices were perfect after drowning them in my soup. Although the pho wasn't served in the massive bowls I was accustomed to, I was surprisingly satisfied. That didn't stop me from scavenging for the last floating bits though. For \u00a310 a bowl, I wouldn't mind some more steak but perhaps I'm just being greedy. However, if you are a big eater, go for the \u00a314 super bowl (ahah, American pun) and you'll have to get your stomach pumped. Otherwise, food is authentic. Service was adequate.

I could imagine my enjoyment of this going up a notch if eating this on a bitter February evening.The meat is wonderfully tender, being easily torn with chopsticks and these work well when mixed with hoi sin and chilli sauce. The meatballs were worth adding and have a pleasant pepperiness. They do not feel too processed either which is an added bonus.One thing that disappointed a little was that there was some confusion as to whether the dish comes with additional beansprouts and herbs on the side. We were given a small plate with these but it wasn't clear if it was for one specific pho dish (we ordered different types of pho) or if it was meant to be shared (in which case there wasn't anywhere near enough). This small but important detail could have elevated the meal a level at least for me because I value the subtle savouriness and juice that beansprouts offer between heavy mouthfuls of beef fat and sauce.I would highly recommend C\u00e2y Tre for the quality of its food at its price point and for the atmosphere inside the restaurant. It has a quiet elegance and helpful staff fitting of a west end eatery.",

Not only is the food great but so is the staff, super friendly. They are busy every night so make sure to make reservations. If not, you might get lucky to sit at the community table, which is still good. I love the tofu soup, clay pot fish, Choi sum stirfy, vegetarian vermicelli bowl, and eggplant with tofu. I will definitely come back on my next trip.",

    "text": "The Cay Tre in Shoreditch is the one I remember had good traditional Vietnamese food and there are many good restaurants there. So when I came across one with the same name in Soho, and having the biggest urge to chump on a bowl of beef pho laced with serracha, I had to try. Unfortunately I was not impress. First notable thing was, they didn't soak the pho in cold water straight after cooking it, so the texture of the rice noodle, became overcooked and slightly mush. I usually also finish the broth, but it was salty. The other negs, had to keep pestering staff for some chopsticks and spoon, after they brought out the food, if this was some kind of torture, it was not funny. We came about 7pm, and half the drinks were sold out. I was really dying for sweet ice coffee, I guess its not my day. Moving on, the interior, I thought was quite nice, very slick, and very big, considering how small it looked from the outside. The final bill came, slightly more pricey, but expected as in central London. Could have been better food quality. So its an average score from me.",

The restaurant is in a convenient location, and usually has a good crowd. We went in at around 7.30pm and the place was packed with a very good atmosphere. The pho soups also looked very good. Prices are decent as are portions. As far as Vietnamese food goes, this was authentic and very good.",

    "text": "Was referred by a tour guide to check out this place and it was a pretty hip and young crowd over the weekend. My Vietnamese friend was able to chat with the wait service in her native tongue and they were all very friendly people here. \u00a0The Em Yue Anh baby drink with Absolute vodka, passion fruit liquor lime and grenadine was light and refreshing and it wasn't too strong and that was perfect for me. We next enjoyed the green papaya salad but I am accustomed to shrimp and the beef served was brisket and dry and it should have been served with a beef jerky in the traditional Vietnamese way. The flavoring was good though. Next we tried the Cay Tre platter for two called the wrap & roll which was done very well. The Vietnamese style egg roll was done perfectly with rice wrapping which my friend says is much harder to do but is traditionally done this way so kudos to the chef for that. The spring roll was okay but the rice wrap was a little too firm however I really enjoyed the fresh basil and mint that stood out in the wrap. The beef roll (Bo lo lat) was tender and wonderfully seasoned. Lastly we finished off dinner with the Hanoi Garliky pho which is different from traditional pho because the beef is saut\u00e9ed rather than served raw and then cooked in the broth. The beef was good but they didn't have enough mint basil complement and they gave lemon instead of lime to season the broth. The broth was also kind of bland. I didn't taste any fish sauce and it wasn't with any salt. There was a large clove of garlic in the soup but I didn't taste any garlickiness in the broth either. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. All in all I would come back and try other foods on the menu mainly because the service was so nice.",

The minced chicken dumplings (because I can't remember what they called them) were the single best thing we ate a week in London. I LOVE Hanoi style Pho and this is the only place other than North Vietnam that I have found that makes it (which is crazy if you know the difference). Grace had Saigon style, I had Hanoi style and my niece had veggie. All were amazing. Best part, 3 of us ate and drank with starters for \u00a385.",

Remember: ONLY eat at Vietnamese restaurants where the majority of patrons are actually Vietnamese if you want authentic and delicious food. Let's start off with the pho. They had about 15 options for different types of pho. AREYOUFCKNKIDDINGME. Anyway, I couldn't find anything redeeming about the pho even though I really wanted to! I swear! My sister wrote it off so quickly that I didn't believe her. Then I tried it. The meat was tough that night, they don't even use the right herbs (they use mint, wtf? The waitress said they don't grow basil on this side of the pond. Seriously? \u00a0Might as well give me a hotdog with tofu on it), and the broth (which is the most important part of pho) was tasteless and had no depth.We also got the Banh Cuon which is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes. The one thing they messed up on with this dish was the sauce that goes with the banh cuon -- nuoc mam Cham. Instead of that, they gave me some type of sauce with black pepper in it. I can't eeeeeven. So by now I was crying inside about the fact that there are horrible Vietnamese restaurants out there and that I was eating at one of them. In London. On vacation. The only two redeeming things (why I'm giving it 2 stars) about this restaurant was the CHA GIO (egg rolls-you can't mess up something that's fried) and our waitress who was extremely patient with my snooty butt. I had a moment where I was sticking my nose in the air asking \"where's this, where's that, why is it like that, who eats that, blah blah blah.\" Sorry. I was just Hangry. I'm human. Anyway, if you want real authentic Vietnamese...well, GTFO of London.",

As there was a few of us, we opted for the set menu which was \u00a323 pp and included a sharing platter for starters and for the main course 1 dish and a side per person. The sharing platter consisted of Pork Spring rolls, Chilli Salt and Pepper Squid and Wild Shrimp Fresh Rolls & Cha La Lot. When we enquired if there was any beef in the starters, we were told that the Cha La Lot had beef in it, however the restaurant were very accommodating and changed it to Vegetarian Spring rolls instead. For mains, the waiter recommended 2 rices and a veg so we opted for one Jasmine Rice and one Egg Fried Rice as well as Chouchou - a fruit we were told. I had the Sizzling seafood which consisted of prawns, squid and mussels, one of my companions the Saigon Stewed Pork Belly and the other Duck with Green Peppercorn. All dishes were nice however the size of the rice portions were MASSIVE!! We definitely did not need 2 portions of rice between 3 of us! Only half of the Egg Fried Rice got eaten and the Jasmine rice was picked at. They were tasty and Chouchou is.... interesting.Overall the place was okay. It took ages for the waiter to actually come and take our order and then when we tried to get the waiter to come over again to ask for more water, he said sorry someone else will come, to which someone else did but then they referred us over to someone else and this was just frustrating after a while - especially when we had to go to the theatre after! I'm not sure I would come back but I did enjoy it. In hindsight, I should have maybe tried the Pho instead.",

    "text": "Crap service, but delicious food. BE CAREFUL IF YOU EAT HERE. (See my note below). We went there on a Sunday afternoon. Service was chaos from the moment we stepped in the door. The maitre D told us that it would be a 5 minute wait, proceeded to give our table to a group of 3 who were there before us that he had forgotten about, and then came over again to ask us how many we were, as if we had just walked in the door and he was seeing us for the first time. Once we were finally seated, we waited about 15 minutes before asking for a waiter since no one could be bothered to come to our table. The food was delicious. We had vietnamese rolls, yummy cha lo lot (pork stuffed in some herbs), and an assortment of noodles. If the food wasn't so good, I would have given the restaurant 1 star because the service was so atrocious. 1 of the 4 main courses we ordered came 10 minutes after the others. And it only came after we asked for it. Here is the worst part: once we flagged someone down to bring us the bill (and again, this took ages), we asked the bill to be split in half. The waitress proceeded to divide the bill in two and then ROUND UP EACH HALF! I couldnt tell if she just didnt know how to do simple basic maths (in which case she should not be working there), or if she was taking the piss. BE CAREFUL IF YOU EAT HERE. I dont know if this is standard policy at this restaurant, but tip of 12.5% (which they did NOT deserve) was already added onand the audacity to round up our bill? I told her it was no different than taking the extra pound straight out of my pocket. I dont know if that registered at all, or if she even cared. It is too bad that no one resembling management could be found when we left, otherwise they would have received an earful from meabout the poor overall service and the trick they tried to pull at the end with our bill. What a shame about the service, since the food was delicious. As others have said, there are plenty of other places to spend your money. Go to this restaurant at your peril.",
