    "text": "Woodlands! Curious name for a vegetarian restaurant. More like deforestation. And I would recommend immediate defenestration for the chef. Let me explain As curry afficionados and backed up with Vince Cable's enthusiastic recommendation, this place seemed ideal for a tasty and reasonably priced meal. The food was ok but nothing special, though the bill was pretty hefty at \u00a369 for 2. In fact ridiculously hefty for a very average vegetarian meal. Food + wine came to \u00a352.50 equating to a service charge of around 33%. Ok, maybe it serves us right for not thoroughly checking the bill and maybe they made a genuine mistake. BUT that was only the beginning of our walk in the woods as both my friend and I suffered major, and there's no way of putting this politely, toilet malfunction, on a scale I haven't experienced since backpacking around the subcontinent over 20 years ago. His started about 30 minutes after saying goodbye, mine the next morning. No matter, I'm still suffering the effects 36 hours later as I type these words after most of my flora and fauna have been thoroughly ravaged As Oscar Wilde might have said, to suffer one indignity is bad enough but to suffer two on the trots is bad form. I suspect the runny spinach may have played a partI would have given 0 stars if I could. So avoid. Like the plague. Unless you are happy to pay for the privilege of being a human petri dish. If you want a true taste of southern India then go to Balham and Tooting High Rd where the food is half the price and twice as nice.",

The service was excellent. The waiters were thoughtful, considerate and interested in my opinion of the food. They helped me with the choice of Thali, as there were 4 to choose from. Not an outstanding meal, but I could taste all the ingredients.",

The reason that it's not a great place to eat is mainly due to the sometimes unfriendly staff and the seating layout. Most of the seating is to be found hidden right at the back of the restaurant but there is some right in the window at the front which is where they place people first to make the restaurant look full. Prices are quite steep too, but if you're careful about what you order then it is possible to eat relatively cheaply. Don't be totally put off by the negative points though. the food is generally very good.",

In the words of my 10 year old daughter \"the channa masala is to die for! \" I agree, it was the best I have ever had and I consider myself quite an Indian connoisseur! The Dosa was light and yummy, the dal was delicious and the Merlot was smooth. \u00a0The lemon rice was a great acconpanyment and they had many many vegan choices!!!! The waitor was so nice, and we ended leaving all the choices to him, which was worth it. He was so helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. If you are in London I would make the effort to go here even if you are not vegetarian or vegan! Yummy!",

    "text": "Woodlands is the favoured restaurant in London for anyone who likes south Indian (Tamil Nadu) vegetarian cuisine (99% of Indian restaurants in Europe specialise in north Indian cooking and although they have lots of vegetarian dishes on the menu, few have south Indian specialities). Woodlands was opened about 20 years ago and is plain and unadorned, but the cooking and service are good, and and the food extremely tasty. South Indians like their food hotter than in the north, but not extremely so. However, everything is well spiced. Idosas, idlis, vadas and uttapams are the main dishes and are combined with sambhar (a type of dal), rasam (tamarind dal), dry and curried vegetables and pachadi (yogurt). Seasonings and herbs include coconut, peanuts, tamarind, chilies, cilantro (coriander) and fenugreek seeds. It's very usual to order a thali (see photo) which holds an assortment of small dishes including the sweets. But ordering a thali denies one the chance of having the amazing paper dosas, which are huge crispy pancakes (see photo), broken with the fingers and dipped into a spicy sauce (sambar). Mango lassi (yoghurt drink) is the best thing to drink with the meal and Indians like coffee after it. Woodlands has a small but decent wine list, but wine doesn't really go with Indian food and even less with south Indian cooking. If you really want to drink, a Kingfisher beer is best. Seating is in two areas - one as one enters and a long rather narrow room at the back. Sit in the front room for better atmosphere, but be aware of the cold wind from the door!",

    "text": "I have now been to Woodlands on two different occasions, and both times the experience has been divine. The staff is super friendly and the space is quiet, with very simple decor and no music--so different from many Indian restaurants! The thalis are especially good, but it's quite a lot of food for one person. On my most recent visit we opted to share several dishes: paneer tikka masala, vegetables jalfrezi, tarka daal, a lemon rice and a plain rice, and a potato-spinach dish whose name I've forgotten. All were great, but the paneer dish suffered from an overabundance of sauce and a dearth of paneer. Next time I might substitute a dosa, as it's a south Indian specialty. I'd also recommend starting with a sweet (or mango) lassi, which is refreshing and delicious.Overall, I think that the Indian food at Woodlands is the finest I've had so far in London.",

Poor value for money really, more steamed rice than variety and I have never had a Thali before that included your dessert in the same dish.

Given the choice between waiting in the cold for a steak or Woodlands I'd go with the latter.They've got an interesting menu which goes we'll beyond the usual masala/ korma/ vindaloo I've grown to expect at Indian restaurants. They've got a great range of appetizers and even go as far as offering pre-appetizer snacks (you've go to admire their courage at trying to squeeze that extra course in!).The main courses consist of dosa (savoury filled Indian pancakes- delicious), thali platters, South Indian lentil pizzas and vegetarian mains, which are really nice and more like your usual curry recipe. If you're keen to try something new, make the most of the starters and dosa.Deserts looked great but in the end we just had coffee, which was spot on (strong and not too bitter). Overall I was really pleased with the food, the service and, considering this is Marylebone, the price.",

I can't say that it's HIGH value, but can understand that 50% or more of the price probably goes to rent and utilities alone... so i guess that is acceptable.Service - very attentivedecor and ambiance - it felt dark in there, but not romantic dark, more like 5 out of 8 of bulbs just went out, but it's clean, and there is authentic indian music in the background, at really low volume... which I could use a little higher of, as it would make a nice background once one starts talking (but maybe that's just me).still - recommend the ginger-apple-carrot juice (ask for no ice -this way you get 13 ml more : )))tasty, will def go back if i have the chance!",

We ordered a lot of food and I don't think you can go wrong, especially when you ask for the waiter's recommedation. A crowded restuarant usually means they are doing something right.",

However, I am a fatty, and probably fatter than thou, therefore my opinion carries more weight.Twinkle-toed we ascended from the bowels of Bond street tube, our thoughts turning to Tarka Dall and chappattis. The crisp air sharpened our hunger and Christmas lights (in \u00a0November?) sparkled on the lovely Marylebone High street. Charming.On entering Woodlands we were kindly offered the worst table in the house, which we politely declined. We were led to a table surrounded by cackling diners, belllowing their approval of each other.What would you like my dear? I screamed over the noise. The woodlands mixed starter platter, Dall, rice and lentil pizza please! She shouted in my ear-trumpet. What? And.... Oh dear. The mixed starter had obviously been hanging around a fair while, and was pretty bloody awful. Lentil pizza? A soggy failure.The dall was dull, the rice gloopy and repellent, as if a pack of butter had been stirred in a the last minute.Anyone reading this would do well to head to Drummond street, enter the sacred halls of Diwana and eat wonderful food for less than half the price. The only saviour was the service, which was speedy and friendly. My partners only comment? disgusting. And she's the vegetarian.",

    "text": "There are not quite enough of reasonably priced and well-located restaurants in London which serve up freshly made and tasty South Indian fare. Or maybe I'm just an ignoramus who needs to know more. Either way, here is an establishment I had heard of so many times through many of my Indian friends that I felt ashamed that I hadn't been there yet. On a random weeknight, the boyfriend and I felt a craving for South Indian cuisine but couldn't bear the thought of making a trek to East Ham to fulfill said craving when voila, we remembered about the much-heard-of Woodlands near Piccadilly Circus station. We made our way with no small degree of excitement and a mighty appetite - we were not planning on holding back that night.When one sets out to a South Indian establishment, one does not expect a decent offering in terms of chaat variety. Chaat, FYI, refers to snacks/appetisers best had in North India at street-side vendors; it is essentially Indian junk food that evokes memories of home for many Indians. It is not a South Indian phenomenon and imagine our delight when we discover the whole variety on offer in the menu. We shared an Aloo Papri Chaat (Crispy pastry rounds topped with potato, yoghurt and tamarind sauce) - perfectly made, full credit to the chef who can juggle Southern & Northern cuisines so well.I had the Onion Rava Masala Dosa (Cream of wheat pancake with saut\u00e9ed onions and green chillies.Filled with the traditional potato, onions and peas mixture) and the boyfriend opted for the Mysore Masala Dosa (A delicious dosa cooked with butter, spicy 'red' chutneyand the traditional potato filling.) All Dosas are accompanied with Sambar (lentil dipping stew) and coconut chutney. Our long-suppressed cravings were much satiated and in our elation, we let ourselves go and even went ahead and ordered another Onion Rava Masala Dosa to split between the two of us - making it a greedy 1.5mains each between the two of us :P The dosas were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside - just the way they are meant to be and the sambar was redolent with spices and flavour, which is important...the best of dosas can be ruined by a bland serving of sambar.We were rather full by the end of that and had to ruefully skip dessert but we lingered on for the Masala Tea - thumbs up for this too.The prices are reasonable for the locality, best not to compare against the dirt-cheap establishments in East Ham. The service was great, we appreciated the thoughtfulness of the staff to split the dosa into halves, which we hadn't asked for and was really helpful.This restaurant is a vegetarian establishment but there is not a chance you will feel the absence of meat on your platter as you explore the offerings on the menu. I am a meat-lover to boot, but I highly recommend that you check this restaurant out.",

What you eat in most Indian restaurants covers about 0.001% of the \u00a0flavours, meats, spices & methods used in Indian cooking.South Indian cooking, for instance,uses very little garlic, creme, butter and is primarily vegetarian. Woodlands is a south Indian restaraunt and it specializes in dishes like vada, Dosa, uttapam, idli, avail. If you go to woodlands and ask for chicken tikka masala or tandoori whatever or Saag paneer, u are doing yourself a disservice.The rule at woodlands is \"if you've heard of that dish before, don't order it\" Happy exploring.",

We started with a mixed plattern of little bits and bites like Cashew Nut Pakora and Masala Poppadums ( Savoury crips garnished with chopped onion, tomato, cucumber and green chilli and coriander) All was really good. But my personal highlight of the night was the Masala Dosa! It was acutally the best Dosa i had, since i have left India three years ago. I would come back only for the Dosa!!! For the main course we had some different dishes coming up with riche or Butter Naan. All were very tasteful and the way they were served seemed really authentic to me. The service was good, always making sure that we had enough to drink and are enjoying our food. As deserts we had Gulab Jammum ( Golden condensed milk dumplings in a rose and saffran syrup) Amazing! You really gotta try this. If there would be one thing i would be picky about, it would be the interieur of the dining room in the back of the restaurant. It is not really the most relaxing place to sit in. At least the plastic flowers hanging down from the ceiling could be changed into real ones, but in a way this also fits to India.. ;-)",

    "text": "One of the top 10 best meals I have ever had was at Woodlands. This is no slight compliment, as I've eaten at many of the top restaurants in the U.S. The food was so flavorful and delicious that I worried that I was disturbing the man reading his newspaper next to me because I couldn't control my exclamations of delight as I was eating. It's worth noting that I eat mostly vegetarian and that I am not an incredibly adventurous Indian food eater. So if you are a person that is constantly trying the most exotic, fiery hot things on the menu, we may have different palates. But no matter who you are, I doubt you'll feel misled if you take my advice and come here sometime - preferably while very hungry.The decor of the restaurant is pretty clean and attractive. Nothing that really stood out to me. And the service is good but not great. It is really the food - and the vegetarian emphasis - that brings people here.I personally loved the \"set meals\" which give you an appetizer, large main course consisting of 6-7 dishes of various foods, and dessert. My favorite one was the New Delhi, and I believe the one I liked second most, which my wife enjoyed, was called the London. They're the bottom two meals on that section of the menu. As far as bread, the dosa (crispy-yet-soft shell filled with potato-y goodness), latka-like potato pancake, and all forms of naan were delectable.I only regret that I live 9 hours from London, or else I'd come here once each month to treat myself.",

I discovered a part of Indian food I had not clue about as I was more used to regular Indian food with meat.Here the tastes are even more elaborate, using delicious spices and showing much more refinement.Loved the starters, loved my kind of pancake with a mix of spinach and lentils, and after trying the chickpeas curry, we tried the recipe at home as it was delicious :-)",

    "text": "Date Night last week brought us to Woodlands. The restaurant is very nicely decorated with a kind of casual romantic feel. The ladies room is odd... Go through the door in the dining room, walk up some exquisitely steep stairs and into a tiny little closet of a restroom. We decided that the Cashew Nut Pakora sounded interesting as a starter... cashew nuts, quick fried in a crunchy batter. Our impression? Indian popcorn. It was definitely interesting, but I'm not sure that we'd go for the same again next time.The four mini South Indian Lentil pizzas came next. Each had it's own flavour, but tasted largely the same. Though they didn't taste very different, we really enjoyed them. The coconut chutney was refreshing and flavourful. The mysore chutney was a bit spicy for me, but my heat loving husband really enjoyed it.For our mains, we got the Woodlands Kofta and the Woodlands Korma. I'm a Korma fan. It's my go to meal, and though it wasn't the best I've ever had here at Woodlands, it was really nice. We decided on getting the Kofta because it was very unique and we hadn't heard of anything like it before. The creamy potato, spinach and pumpkin dumplings in a rich tomato gravy was every bit as interesting as it promised to be. This was not a dish I'd order again. Chris finished it off and seemed like he thought it was okay. All in all, we enjoyed our meal, but Woodlands is not quite up to the caliber of Diwana Bhel Poori House.",

    "text": "This was a wonderful dining experience. The all vegetarian menu was incredible and the food was amazing. Since we weren't super familiar with the cuisine on the menu, we all feasted on \"tasting\" type options. For starters we had two variety platters: the Woodlands Variety Platter and the \"Tandoori Platter.\" Both were excellent and provided us with tons of different items to try for the first time. We had a great time sharing and discussing our favorite items. For dinner we had Thalis (whole meals comprised of a balanced mix of items from the menu). This included the Woodlands Thali and the London Royal Thali. For drinks members of our party had cocktails from the bar and \u00a0Mango Lassis. The food was so good. The only two issues were probably just bad-timing and likely won't be an issue for other diners in the future: (1) There is a heat wave in London currently and the air conditioning really wasn't cutting it. As an American who is spoiled and accustomed to refrigerated buildings when it's hot outside, it was pretty uncomfortable, especially when you add hot curries to your system. and (2) we were seated next to a large group (8 to 10 people) and they were very loud for our whole meal. We had difficulty hearing each other over their din so our dinner conversation was a challenge. Again, this is an excellent restaurant and a great place for anyone to try a wide variety of Indian foods without having to make too many choices on the menu. It's even a great place for meat eaters who think they won't enjoy vegetarian--it was that good! The issues we experienced probably won't be issues for others. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

Though I was dining alone, I was given a lovely table near the window and served with attention and courtesy. The thali selection was lovely and I had the Keralan thali on recommendation of the server. The food was deliciously prepared with just the right amount of spice. The flavours were full and varied and I enjoyed spending my time savouring each. I highly recommend the salted lassi with or after the meal. It is a refreshing complement.",

    "text": "I had been meaning to go to Woodlands for years, hearing it had some of the best South Indian food in London, and it did not disappoint! North Indian and Bangladeshi food are easy to come by in London, but South Indian food less so. If you live in London, or if you're visiting London, it's close enough to central London that it's easy to make the trip on the tube.We started with a plate of assorted starters: mostly grilled vegetables and cheese. If you have never had a piece of grilled paneer (cheese), your life is not yet complete, so make sure to address that. \u00a0We shared a plate of uttapams and a gigantic paper dosa. Both were delicious and deeply satisfying with rich flavours. The reasonably priced wine list completes the evening. The interior was slightly decorated for the holidays, cutely, and in a not-too-fussy way. The place is formal not sloppy, but not super fancy like some of the other Indian places in the city.Gluten free notes: Almost all South Indian food is naturally gluten-free. Do not order anything with \"rava\" in it -- that means wheat. The non-rava dosas and other dishes are made out of rice and lentil. Our server knew what gluten was, and was able to give advice. Enjoy!",

It usually bears no resemblance to the home cooking I grew up with, particularly with the number of meat dishes on the menu as so much of India is vegetarian. Thankfully these days 'vegetarian' dishes are not consigned to the sundries part of the menu at the back and in the Woodlands they take pride of place. We asked them to bring a mix of appetisers to start us all off and the delighted us with a lovely variety, including he delightfully named and tasting yoghurt shots!I chose Chana Masala and the recommended bread that came with it, looking like a football that I took great pleasure in 'deflating' before it could be broken and shared easily with friends. All the food was excellent, with my main dish being served in a teasingly lop-sided bowl.We were a large (international, multi language) group and yet still received excellent service. The staff clearly know how to accomodate large groups and looked after all of us very well. Good value, great location, fabulous service. Recommended!",

If you're looking for some delicious comfort food, I highly recommend Woodlands! The Daal Tarka (I know, they spell it this war round), was amazing, as always!I would, however, like to see the Naan bread on the vegan menu! (It was crossed out both times I visited). My only complaint is that the staff could definitely serve their customers faster. The second time I visited, we were the one of two tables (it was pretty early) and it still took ~10mins to get menus and some extra time to give our orders. From what I've seen in other reviews, the service tends to be the limiting factor. If Woodlands stepped this up, they would definitely get be closer to 5 stars for me.",

It was around \u00a318 a head, and that's not counting drinks and in principle I hate having to pay extra for good vegetarian food - it should be available as standard! The staff were also not attentive and didn't really seem to care that we were there or not. It took a long time to order and for a nearly empty restaurant we had to hound them for the bill.The decor is very classy, it's a lovely restaurant with some great features (I loved the lampshades in the back portion of the restaurant). I did like the elegant design of the menu and how neat and tidy the place is. If you're trying to impress a date, or on a business lunch, I could see that this would be the place to go.We ordered a selection of dishes and the bread basket, and I loved how fresh it tasted and the juxtaposition of ingredients and spices... However this is something I feel that you should expect from a vegetarian restaurant. It's great that there were some usual flavours going on, however I could understand that those that would like to know what they should expect might be a bit apprehensive ordering here.My favourite dish was the Pesarettu Dosa with spinach and the Bhindi Masala (okra), which I would recommend. The Okra however is quite spicy.So to sum up:Pro's - Great vegetarian food with a range of unusual flavours. Classy decor.Con's - Staff and price.",

I was on the fence about getting dessert, so I was taking my time. Since it was nearing closing time, the owner (I assume he's the owner) was sitting next to our table reading a newspaper. I made eye contact with him and he asked me how dinner was. I told him it was great. Then he asked me if I was going to have dessert. I told him I was so full that I wouldn't get dessert because I wouldn't be able to finish it and didn't want anything to go to waste. He called a waiter over and told him to get me a little dessert. I told him no, it was okay, he didn't have to. But he insisted. So they brought me out a small portion of a dessert. AND they didn't charge me for dessert. A small gesture like this goes a long way. \u00a0I felt well taken care of, like I was family. If I visit London again, I would definitely eat here again.",

The chili cheese naan was a definite highlight. We left feeling full but not gross the way you sometimes do after Indian. I would definitely go back and recommend it!",

    "text": "Our cravings for some South Indian food led us to woodlands. Easily walkable from the Baker Street station this is situated in maryleborne high street. The interiors are rather simple, nothing much to write about. The menu comprises of both north and South Indian cuisines with a larger variety in the South Indian category. They have appetizers with street food selectors to grills. Of what we ordered I would recommend the Mysore dosa, the woodland variety platter, medu Vada and if you're looking for a proper 3 course meal then opt for one of the Thalis. The price point is high and not the service is not the best. With an establishment that has been around for long one would expect a warmer treatment and friendlier service. I think I would search for a better place for my South Indian grub the next time. Keep gobbling xx",

    "text": "The third time's a charm...On my first two visits, I liked Woodlands. Enough to keep coming back. My veggie pals always delight in their all veggie menu (and hey, we can all use a night to put our carnivorous ways to rest, right?) and they have the ability to seat a large group pretty easily in their back room. I've been in twice with groups of 12-15, and both have been handled very gracefully. In fact, I think they almost handle the bigger groups better! When I came with a gal pal one cold and rainy night, we had to beg for service (and were seated in the front window)...and waited for what seemed like an eternity for any request. With a big group? They are on it! May have just been an off night. The food is wonderful. Made with love, very tasty (and plentiful) options! I had the Woodlands Korma on my last visit and found it to be very tasty. Well portioned, and we all shared about 12 bottles of white wine...so were feeling quite festive as we exited. All of the appetizers were filled with victory, and the dosas I spied around the table were devoured without complaint...in fact, rounds of \"mmmms\" surely were heard around the world. All rice and naan orders come separately, so make sure to order a few of the basics and some of the more adventurous and creative varieties. Reservations can be made online, but I suggest calling. It's just a bit easier for them, I think. A nice treat in this neighborhood. Friendly service, great food and extremely vegetarian-friendly...",

    "text": "My internet didnt work last night, so here is my review for Woodlands (with a few hours delay, but still oh so true):Ok, let me write this down quickly, before my body collapses in a food coma. Right now I find myself in between heaven and hell, heaven, because of the fantastic Indian food I just ate and hell because of the amount of food that I just ate. Lets put it this way: the food was so good that I just couldnt stop eating although my body probaply reached its capacities at some point around the 4th or 5th appetizier already. Joghurt shots (actual food, not drinks), Paneer Lal Mirch (Cubes of Indian cottage cheese) or Medu Vada (fried lentil doughnuts) just to name a few. Of all the main dishes I tried (we were about 11 people so there was a huge variety of flavors on the table), I think I liked the Woodlands Kofta best. The tomato gravy was just perfectly creamy and delicious.And the service? The service was just amazing. Friendly, fast and attentive. One of the waiters even presented us a lady finger at the table, because we didnt know what it was when we read the menu. Great, great, great! The interior did not blow my mind, but whatever, the dishes were delish! So here come my 5 stars for food, service and value prices.",

Also try the batura (fried bread that looks like the shape of an American football). It's a great vegetarian restaurant so definitely worth the visit if you're in the area.",
