    "text": "Tay Do is the (somewhat) upmarket version of Tay Do Cafe on the other side of the street (presumably the first was opened after the success of the latter). I haven't been able to detect any differences in either the variety or cost of items on the menu, so essentially it's a question of decor and perhaps service (the food in both places being excellent - Lemongrass Tofu is normally a standout - though the version I had on Friday night when the restaurant was very busy was less so). The restaurant, as you might expect has a somewhat fancier decor, and somewhat larger space. It seems popular with larger (somewhat drunken) groups out celebrating birthdays and the like, and certainly has more space. If you are a couple and want a private table this is probably the better bet. On the occasions I have been there I have thought the service in the Tay Do is friendlier and a little faster than Tay Do Cafe, and I get the sense you would be welcome to linger and talk a bit longer here than at the cafe, but not sure if this is really true. Depending on my mood I tend to oscillate between the two places. Bottom-Line: Check out both and decide which suits your personal vibe better.",

The presentation of the food is great, I would highly recommend the veg rolls as a starter. I cant wait to go again.",

Not that Tay Do is expensive at all- the portions are huge and all main courses come under 10 pounds. Whilst I would recommend the smaller, more intimate Cafe for dinner- Tay Do is cosier, more fun and you can take your own alcohol- the restaurant is perfect for large parties and during lunch time is packed full of office groups. My work colleagues come at least once a week during our lunch break due to the 4.95 lunch special and the fact that you can easily get a table for ten people. The lunch menu comes with a choice of starter- soup or prawn toast- and a choice of about 20 different main dishes of which the Pho and the chicken salad are best. Between our group we must have tried everything on the menu- only the gluey ho fun dishes are disappointing.",

Same rules apply, you bring your wine or beers in, you ask for all the food altogether (no starters-main structure) and you bear in mind they are big portions, so don't be tempted to ask for loads of items just because you are hungry or because the price is good.If you are wise enough you could have a great dinner and pay way less than 10 pounds.Tay do, or, actually, any of the Vietnamese in Kingsland road is a convenient restaurant if you are going out around Shoreditch, Old street or Brick lane.Food is great. Noodles are not bad, and the meat dishes are superb. It is like a chinesse restaurant but leaner, more aromatic and basically with a more flavoursome twist to it. My safe bet is noodle soups. They are massive and full of fresh herbs, chillies and soy on side. They are also full of meat and seafood or whatever it is meant to have. You know when you ask for a poultry or prawns dish and you get just enough to be seen but no to be chewed???? Like in most indian restaurants where you cannot see the lamb all covered in the sauce????here is different, you ask for duck soup you do get it.tay do, the second one going towards hackney right after the Viet Grill",

    "text": "In my opinion, when it comes to a Friday night out with a big group of friends, there is little else that beats visiting one of the myriad of Vietnamese restaurants dotted along Kingsland road in bustling Shoreditch. Last night we decided on Tay Do.First things first, if you are thinking about visiting Tay Do on a Friday evening with a party any larger than 2 make sure you have booked a table or you will find yourself at the back of a long and frustrating queue. Secondly, do not expect service to extend beyond taking your order bringing your food and then shortly after your bill. Thirdly, grab a bottle of beer then order adventurously and in abundance.This is the spot for cheap and simple Vietnamese food. The pho soups come in immensely large portions, more than enough for two but do lack some punch in the flavour department. However add a splash of fish sauce, chilli or soy from the tables condiments and you are almost there. Ask for an extra side of Basil or beansprouts if you find yourself wanting more. The deep fried salt and pepper or spicy squid is one of the stars on the menu as is the crispy duck pancakes. The best way to go about enjoying a meal here is to do it the way the Vietnamese do... order a variety of dishes between you and share, share, share!Quite simply Tay Do is and does exactly what you expect it to when you walk in and take a glimpse of the plastic table clothes, flustered waiters and loud and cramped visitors. It feeds you quickly, fills you up and then chases you off your seat. Oh I'm not kidding, don't expect to hang around and enjoy the company of your friends after your meal, they are not afraid to ask you to leave. You won't be blown away but you will leave fairly happy having just had a big meal two course meal for around \u00a310. They also allow \"BYO\".",

Oh the guilt I felt- it's not my fault I wanted to scream! However, Tay Do is not the kind of place you hang around in. Quick in, quick out, bish, bash, bosh and our table was clearly costing them money. Thankfully our buddies didn't take too much longer to arrive and after unscrewing our pre-purchased vino- all was forgiven! The food in Tay Do is pretty awesome. I would definitely recommend the squid starter, soft shell crab and white fish (what fish this is seems to vary) fried with salt, chilli and garlic. So good! Duck in tamarind was less successful- bit too chewy but tasty enough. My poor friend struggled with what can only be described as a bath full of soup. Why make the portion quite so big? Seriously, if his head had slipped I'm sure he would have drowned.... Tay Do is well worth a visit. Not only is the food tasty but it's reasonably priced too. For starters, mains and sides it cost us about \u00a316 each. Added to that it's BYOB so the prices won't be bumped up by the wine bill. Definitely recommended!",

However, the pho came somewhat lukewarm, and the taste was just so-so, with the soup broth very weak. They are very generous with the beef slices though, as well as the quantity of noodles given. Service was prompt but our waiter was not very friendly and had a stone-wall face on him all the time. It is a BYO restaurant (no alcohol is served), but they do charge a \u00a31 fee for corkage per person. This place would get 4 stars from me if it was located anywhere else in London, but on Kingsland Road it does have very stiff competition and unfortunately it will not be one of my favourites there.",

    "text": "Different areas in London are known for different food. In east London Kingsland Road is the place to target for Vietnamese. A friend introduced me to TayDo, we were starving. Before we went there we stopped by at one of the small grocery shops to buy wine and beer. Now this is something, which is a unique selling point of those little Vietnamese restaurant, who one after the other emerge on Kingsland Road. The tradition of buying your own wine comes from when they started up and did not have the licence for alcohol. In the mean time most of those restaurants are allowed to sell wine and beer. However, they kept their BYO policy. This is why you will find many students there, celebrating their birthday parties. The food is exquisite and tastes completely different to the Chinese kitchen. It has a lot of vegetables and is not greasy at all.We normally order a couple of starters to share such as the omelettes with duck or the banh xeo, with its crisp turmeric-yellow exterior and filling of juicy chicken and crunchy bean sprouts. As a main I experimented last time by spying on my neighbours who ordered caramelised mekong catfish in a clay pot. Even if you have a very big appetite, this place has generous portions.We were asked to pay in cash, a friend of mine had to look for a cash machine outside, which took a while until he got back. But fair enough, you never pay more then a 10er. The look of the restaurant from outside does not do a particular favour, as the it is just placed behind a dodgy bus station and looks more like a canteen, but don't be misled by that!",

There is a selection of about 15 resturants, all of which will stand empty for most weekdays apart from this one. There are loads of tightly packed tables, crammed together, each one filled with a punter and people even waiting outside the front to come in.I went here for a birthday party and it was a great venue for several reasons:1. it was bring your own2. it was really cheap3. the menu is like a small book with loads of selectionThe birthday boy had eaten at this place 4 time in the same week so it was a favorite with him but before I continue I'll give you some context. Said birthday boy was the UK weight watcher of the year a few years ago and every birthday he like to get on the wagon a bit and eat as much fried food as possible. Me and my fella should have remembered this as we stupidly ordered on his recommendatition, crispy noodles with black bean sauce. YUCK! it was the most revolting thing I have ever ordered out, greasy noodles in a sweet rich sauce. I feel sick just thinking about it now.I did manage to eat lots though, trying others dishes, as all the portions were huge. The food is lovely I just choose badly.This place is great for a quick bite to eat on your way home as well as parties. I would go back again just a bit disappointed by my lack of judgment.",

Fried squid stuffed pork2. papaya salad with prawns3. fried squid4. vietnamese spring rolls5. vietnamese omelette6. tay do special (glass noodle salad with chopped pork stomach, char grilled pork, salad and fresh herbs)7. pho bo with beef i would like to give 4 stars as the interior is clean yet pretty plastic and crappy, but the food is so good, it really distracts from that. 5 stars the place therefore deserves!",

    "text": "My friends wanted to meet at this Vietnamese restaurant but couldn't remember the name to meet me there. \u00a0So as I rounded Kingsland Road off of Old Street on this typically rainy winter evening \u00a0(ok I guess technically it's still Shoreditch High Street at that point), I picked up my friends who had parked there car just around the corner. \u00a0Sure enough, the place is a kind of non descript hole in the wall and I even had to look at Google Maps to figure out the name of the place today when I went to write this review.It was VERY hot, VERY loud and VERY crowded (there were three of us and we had to sit at the end of a long table setup for 10 embedded into a large party of 7 others). I found it a bit funny that a place like this would actually take bookings ... it certainly didn't need to and I would have been a bit happier at the four top that they kicked us out of after another waiter sat us there, but that's life.I didn't know it was Bring Your Own so we were sans-alcoholic beverage - so be sure to pick up some wine before you head in. \u00a0Still, the fresh lemonade was cold and \u00a0delicious.The menu is about 100 pages long (ok a light exaggeration, but it's pretty damn big). \u00a0The food comes flying out of the kitchen almost as soon as you finish the last sentence of your order and it was pretty incredible. \u00a0Each dish was extremely tasty - especially the Chow Mein noodles and the Rice and Mushroom Clay Pot. \u00a0My friends are vegetarians so I went with the flow (though my mouth was watering looking over at my 7 new friends grazing on some kind of creation including duck (to hell with Daffy, I wanted to share their wine and their meat). \u00a0I did manage to make one deviation in that I asked for some prawn crackers. \u00a0Still, I enjoyed our Tofu dish but did wonder to myself - have I had enough protein during this carb-loaded delight. \u00a0We asked for tap water literally 5 times before we got it - each time being assured it would come and each time watching the waiter walk half way to the bar area only to be interrupted by someone that wanted something they actually had to pay for forcing the waiter to forget us. \u00a0 We asked for desert and the waiter said no (and with his eyes, I'm sure he screamed out - you've eaten, now get the hell out). \u00a0We stood up to leave and two people swarmed in to remove our dishes and they were literally cleaning off our table for the next guests before I even got my coat on (did that guy just push me?). \u00a0Oh, did I mention the meal was a total of 30 quid? \u00a0Amazing value for price.I'd recommend this place - but it's not for the feint of heart. \u00a0The food is unique, served fast and tasty but be prepared not to be able to hear your friends and to get the feeling that you are part of some large culinary assembly line where the staff are trained to get you out as soon as they can to make room for the next group. \u00a0Luckily we found a very quiet cafe to have the conversations we couldn't have over dinner.",

The waiter said the meals were the same except for the amount of veg, and refused to serve me the lunch version. \u00a0He seemed convinced that the confusion was entirely my fault. (2) As has happened to other reviewers, the waiter said, when it was time to pay(!) that the credit card machine wasn't working and we had to pay cash. Generally inattentive and ungracious service.

The pho was pretty good- not the best beef or pork that I have had in a pho but I have a feeling the kitchen staff has made these to suit a more 'Londoner' palate rather than traditional Vietnamese. The sides on the table are good and the chilli paste had a nice kick to it. The menu is loooonnnngggg and I don't know if you can really go wrong with too much as long as you use the chilli paste to spice things up. There is soups, stir-frys, deep-fried bits and pieces perfect for a hangover, a tofu section and the Viet salads. The Vietnamese spring roll was exactly what you would have expected and they cut it up in 8 pieces so easy to share. Highly recommended was the aubergine with soy sauce. I could eat this for days. It went well with the satay chicken (not something I would usually go for but also very delicious). The staff are really lovely, a little spacey, but really nice and eager to help. The kitchen thinks about timing and nailed it even on a very busy Saturday night.",

Summer rolls came and ingredients were alright-fresh. Not very generous on the shrimps while piling the roll up with vermicelli. The spicy squid dish came quite quickly as it was supposed to be deep fried... Squid was obviously from frozen, not a lot of spiciness or taste even within the squid itself... The worst was the Pho. The soup was terrible, more like watered down vegetable soup with a tint of chicken broth mixed into it. Vegetables looked awfully served, snap peas, corn and carrots? Vietnamese Pho? I've gotten better 'fusion' food on kingsland road than anything in this bowl. You've got to be kidding me with the ingredients. Tofu was medium hard and everything about the so called 'Pho' here is just heading towards the wrong direction. Noodles were soggy and lacked texture. Arg, a waste of calories. They do have a broad menu.. Which ranges to even serving Peking duck (what I saw the other tables munching on...) \u00a0Avoid on all cost unless you enjoy non authentic Vietnamese dishes. The food here is typically all 'White Asian dishes'.",

They have recently increased their prices so a bowl of pho is \u00a310.00! \u00a0Way too much for a bowl of semi-decent pho.Being a West Coast American, Pho is pretty much a staple so in my early days in London I kept looking for comparable Pho. \u00a0Needless to say I was disappointed all the time as Pho here isn't as good (both in quality and quantity)... you basically don't get much bang for your buck/quid. Unfortunately you don't get the bang for the buck you used to at Tay Do. \u00a0However, if I do want pho, I head here... they're probably the best out of the lot and they're definitely better than Song Que (see my review from there if you're interested)",

The table was ready for us as soon as we got here which was a good start, and by no means a guarantee at this type of restaurant at a busy time. I'd read from other reviews about the massive menu (over 220 items) and so suggested to the group that we ask the waitress to decide for us. This was a tough choice given that two of the group are control freaks but it was the best decision of the night. \u00a0We agreed with the waitress that we'd have 4 starters and 5 main dishes and after a chat with her boss (where I assume they discussed what they should serve us) she proceeded to deliver a string of amazing dishes - many of them things that we would never had ordered. It also saved us from the monotomy of the standard asian food order - prawn toast, spring rolls, spare ribs and chicken satay.Having not actually chosen anything I can only guess at the names of some of the dishes we had. There was definitely some spicy squid and summer rolls amongst the starters, following this we had some beautiful fried fish, king prawns in a stew, an amazing roast duck dish and udon noodles with mixed meats amongst others. Every dish was lovely, hot and fresh. We just about finished everything and were well and truly stuffed.I'd recommend this place really highly, but more than this I'd really recommend the approach of allowing the restaurant to choose what you eat, particularly if you're not that familiar with much of the cuisine. It was a gamble that well and truly paid off.",

You need to go up to the counter in order to pay. Strangely the card reader isn't portable.Since that first time, I've tried vietnamese omelette, fried summer rolls with their sweet sauce, fried frogs legs (which are EXACTLY like fried chicken wings) and some other dishes that are foggy in my mind, not to mention un-pronounceable.

The bowls of noodle soup are generous and the best part, it's BYOB. If you like a few beverages, the amount you save on BYOB with no corkage more than makes up for any slight comparisons in price :) There's a reason why there are two locations on Kingsland road!

NO WATER... dammit man, how can we be expected to live under these conditions?! Turns out they now have a liquor license so it's no BYOB. Seeing as I had a bottle of red wine burning a hole in my handbag, we ambled along to Tay Do who helpfully advertise that they welcome you bringing your own wine. Good job, fellas. Consider yourself my new go-to. It's not that I expect BYOB everywhere i go, of course, but it was a great selling point for these places. It's a big restaurant and a lot more spacious than Mien Tay. We ordered up some summer rolls, a Vietnamese pancake, pork bun and pork yuk sung. The summer rolls were pretty standard, I love the pancake, it was hugely tasty and left me wishing I'd ordered my own. Disaster came when I was eating the yuk sung, it is minced pork and vermicelli noodles wrapped in lettuce. Chewing away I realised I was eating a staple as well as pork. Not great, I called over the waitress and she was a bit non-verbal on it. But they brought me out another dish. This isn't really the kind of place where they are going to profusely apologise and offer you free food, but i appreciated them replacing it. I'd definitely go back, it was a pretty solid meal.",

However sometimes, depending on the chef, it isn't always as good as the time before.I personally love the phos. Kingsland Road's nickname is 'pho mile' due to the propensity of Vietnamese restaurants serving it.Another dish I love are the goi salads.BYOB is an added bonus.I have noticed that their prices have risen recently :(",
