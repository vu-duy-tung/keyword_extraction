The hosts and manager were all really curteous and each served with a smile on his or her face.The food... Now this is where the restaurant really seperates itself from all other Italians i have been to over the years. The pizza (as you will read in previous reviews) Is unbelievable. Even better than Pizzacano in Leeds (thats how far i have had to go to make a comparison) The pizza is excitingly served on metre long trays and a tables order is all cooked together on the same dough, which is always soft and easy to manage. You cannot imagine integrating meatballs onto a pizza so perfectly.Last night i ate at Pizza Metro Pizza and opted for a pasta. I had the seafood pasta (the Italian of which i cannot remember the name for) It was by far the tastiest pasta dish i have ever had. The muscles were'nt bland or chewy. The King prawns were seemingly steamed and then put into the dish and the whole thing was finished off with a delightful sauce.Top Marks - \u00a0I will be coming back a lot - fact.",

The kitchen is also very accommodating and will make a Vegetarian pizza with no cheese upon request. All of the pizza varieties on the menu are great but what really makes their pizza so delicious is the thin crust and chewy texture of the dough. If you haven't been here yet you're missing out!

    "text": "Let me begin my review by breathing deeply, preparing for shoes to be thrown, and saying... Pizza made in England is, for the mostpart, HORRIBLE. It waddles the fine line between thick and thin crust (it would be extremely un-English to commit to EITHER) with too-salty tomato sauce and too-greasy toppings. I know, as I endured it for 18 years before hopping both ponds and discovering the sensory euphoria that is American and Italian pizza. England and pizza are JUST NOT FRIENDS.Fortunately for you lot (alas, not for me) Pizza Metro set up shop - allowing South-of-the-River residents (and those willing to make the trek - myself included) to enjoy pizza by the METER. It makes for an extremely pleasant dinings experience, particularly as they \"section off\" your enormous pizza slab to accomodate individual taste preferences.Their pizza is thin-crusted, crunchy, salty, cheesy, delicate GOODNESS. The atmosphere is lively and the staff welcoming (if a little bit slow when coping with everybody in the U.K. hoping for a decent bite of pizza). I heard whispered rumors that they deliver, but cannot confirm.",

Everyone is chatting, plates are clinking, pizzas are being munched... There's a mix of big groups of friends, families and couples. I love the fact there seems to always be quite a lot of kids eating in here too, it makes you feel like you're definitely in safe hands if they are catering to lots of families all the time, for some reason...Atmosphere aside, I've had so many pleasant memories of delicious home made pizzas in here.

They are presented on high rectangular trays (which frustratingly sit squarely in front of people's faces so you can't see those sitting opposite you) and are made quickly in proper pizza ovens, and topped with excellent fresh ingredients like ricotta or spicy sausage or rocket. All their pizzas are good, and quality is consistent year after year. Staff are really friendly and enthusiastic. Starters are less accomplished, if not downright poor, and the wine list is completely forgettable. But Pizza Metro has atmosphere (always full) and charm, and is easily one of the best independent neighbourhood pizza places in London.",

To start, the service was excellent- everyone working there seems to be Italian and they were all so kind and welcoming. Everyone in my group ordered pizza and were surprised when our meal arrived as one LONG super-pizza that stretched the length of our table! We'd all ordered different varieties of pizza, so the super-pizza was sectioned off into different toppings. The minute our meal arrived I'd already starting getting excited that we'd definitely have leftovers, but in the end we all stuffed ourselves silly and there wasn't a crumb left on the table.Wine was good, service was great, pizza was life changing!

There are a unique and vast variety of pizzas to choose from. Don't worry, each pizza is not a metre long but can be that way when baked together or ordered in combination. The olives and vegetables are nicely fresh but the grilled vegetables though grilled and presented well were a little bland in taste. The meatballs in sauce are a good choice of starter. There is a limited choice of drinks and these are a little overpriced. But all in all the atmosphere is great, the decorations well placed, the service joyous and the food of high quality; in short a great local pizza place.

    "text": "Came in with some friends for a loy w-key Sunday dinner. I liked the vibe - homey decor, lots of families (a really cute little toddler at one table drumming with an empty water bottle) and small groups. We asked about the \"pizza by the meter\" concept - basically, they bake all the pizzas the table orders into one long super-pizza. So the four of us each ordered a different pizza, but we still got the impressive presentation of a mega-pie on a stand on our table.As for the quality of the pizza, I'd say it was pretty good. I went for the Napoli, with anchovies, capers and black olives. Black olives were from a can - which they actually do in Naples (I was a little surprised when I visited there that they usually use lower quality ingredients as toppings for pizzas - maybe because the only \"legit\" pizzas are marinara and margarita?), but the quality of the cheese and sauce were good. Everyone else liked their pizzas - the guys even went for a second round (too much for me, though - the first was already quite a generous portion!) We split a bottle of Montepulchiano, which went down nicely. Overall, pretty good value, good food, friendly staff. I still prefer Franco Manca (better quality ingredients, better wine), but the presentation here is unique and kind of cool, especially with a group - the more people, the longer the mega-pizza. Good for a low-key, not too expensive dinner out.",

But I think I ordered the wrong pizza - I got the mushroom/truffle oil one, and it wasn't very flavourful. Not bad, but I wasn't excited about it. I liked my starter a lot better, the baked goat cheese. But between the two of these, I couldn't finish my pizza, I was so stuffed! I came with a group of 6 people, and we got good service - they gave me a cute box to stick my leftover pizza in. It was a good time overall, and everyone else seemed to really like their pizza, but it just didn't blow me away.",

    "text": "I was expecting great things from this pizza restaurant, which has rave reviews on most food and restaurant review sites. We went with an Italian friend, who considers this his favourite Italian restaurant in London, which is another high recommendation. For those not in the know, this is a traditional and Italian owned pizza and pasta restaurant, about 5 minutes' walk from Clapham Junction station. Its speciality is pizzas to share: they are oblong, and you order 'by the metre' (actually 25cm per person). It comes on a long platter which, if there are more than two of you, is placed on a metal 'table' put on top of the main table. Three of us had pizza like this, and my other half had pasta. (If there are two of you, they seem to put the smaller platter on the table itself). It's a little pricey - around \u00a39-\u00a310 a head - but freshly made with quality ingredients. Overall, expect to pay around \u00a325 a head for pizza, wine and coffee: 12.5% service charge is added to the bill automatically. The plus points were that the service, when we arrived, was very friendly and swift, and the house wines completely acceptable (although buying by carafe is more expensive than some of the bottled wine, so be warned). They were also happy to serve us generously with tap water, which is another good sign in my book. By 8pm the restaurant began to fill up, and by 9pm it was packed, with people waiting for a table. My partner's seafood pasta arrived first, and smelt very fishy, and was by all accounts delicious. Our pizzas - or should that be pizza? - was a little longer in arriving. They/it were absolutely delicious - the roasted and smoked vegetables on mine were as good as anything I've tasted, and there was plenty of it: I was glad not to have had a starter. The downside, however, was that the platter was metal, and cold, and putting it on the metal stand (also cold) meant that after the first slice my pizza was cooling rapidly, and by the third slice (of four), was completely stone cold. It was also a pain to have a metal stand at nearly at eye level - hardly conducive to good conversation. All in all, this seemed to me like a triumph of gimmickry over food quality. The second gripe was that, as they got busier, service quality declined alarmingly: my partner had to ask for butter (to go with the bread) four times before it arrived. The bill and payment, in contrast, were sorted quickly. Overall, the platter concept spoiled our meal: a normal plate, heated beforehand, would have made all the difference, and apparently they will serve it that way, if you prefer. That is what I shall do in future.",

    "text": "Okay, so the pizza here is seriously good, like in fact everything else at this place.Let's start with the pizza. Quite simply, each ingredient is outstanding. The base is the pivotal element here, enjoying the rare combination of being thin, fluffy and chewy. It's unusual to find this: pizza bases are frequently too crispy or undercooked. But not here - it's absolutely delicious. The tomato sauce meanwhile is fresh, tasty and in a perfectly judged quantity. Likewise, the cheese, all too often the killer of pizzas by being in excess, is sparingly applied and of excellent quality. Together, it all adds up to a class-leading pizza, right up there with Franco Manca and possibly even preferable to it if you don't like the sourdough tang in Franco Manca's pizzas .The pizza alone would merit a 5 star rating for Pizza Metro Pizza. But stopping at that would be unfair on the other aspects of my experience here:The service was fantastic. Quick and polite, with the waiters going out of their way to be helpful, for example always topping up my glass with tap water when I'd emptied it.The dessert was of similarly top quality. I opted for a Tiramisu, which had a consistency perfectly balanced between creamy and moist. I also liked the lack of dessert menu: instead, a waiter simply arrived with a tray containing examples of each dessert on offer. Although Pizza Metro Pizza can't claim a first in this presentation of desserts, it's a rare and welcome innovation when the normal alternative is to buy blind.So, in sum, this is comfortably 5 star material, buoyed by some of the best pizza in London. My only comment is that though the Bufalina I had was excellent, it was also quite expensive at \u00a312.50 - such is this place's mastery of the basics that I'd go for a \u00a38.50 Margherita next time.Overall though, this is one of the top pizzerias in London. Highly recommended to pizza lovers, foodies or anyone after a quick and relatively cheap meal.",

The only damper was that this location is small so if there's a party of, say 10 or more (like a freaking hen-do) don't count of having a \u00a0conversation with your dinner party.

We've done the pizza by the meter thing at Made in Italy, which is closer to where we live. I loved the pizza at Made in Italy so I was doubtful that the pizza at Pizza Metro Pizza would be as good but with all the rave reviews, I figured it was worth trying.We started with a plate of grilled vegetables. The vegetables were very thinly sliced. I'm not sure if I liked that but they were pretty good. Then we got our pizzas -- we each got a pizza. If you're not a big eater, you can probably get by with 2 people to a pizza but you can always take leftovers home. It was pretty good. It seemed like the pizza was not cooked as long as at Made in Italy -- I like my pizzas crispier and slightly burnt as opposed to soft and squishy. One of our pizzas had rocket on top -- kinda strange. It's like taking your salad and dumping it on top of your pizza. Not sure if it worked for me.Overall, the pizza was still excellent.
