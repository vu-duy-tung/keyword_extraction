I will have to go back and taste more in the future. A good address.",

It's not super cheap but the portions are very generous and I often end up taking half my meal home with me so it ends up being ok value for money.",

Got the duck red curry and it had awesome flavor. Definitely recommend the banana leaf platter so you can try some other sides and you don't need a starter. Not a huge selection of beer and wine and no cocktails but it's not too pricey and there are plenty of places nearby to grab a drink after.",

There's a Thai Cafe 10 minutes from me that serves much tastier food, which is a little cheaper.Prices at The Banana Leaf are reasonable but not the best. I guess, in the end up, I've not got anything terrible to say but nothing outstanding, this is quite an average restaurant but if there's nowhere else to go on a Friday night out, try it, you may just like it.",

This speedy super noodle joint serves up delicious plates of really rather authentic Thai food. It's buzzier than Wagamama and cheaper too - the food is more straight up Thai than Asian fusion, and there always seems to be a queue out the door. Particularly perfect for mid night out tummy filling, it's quick, tasty, cheap and lively - there's not a great deal more to say, but then again, what more could you want?",

And finally, I noticed this restaurant now called Banana Tree, and decided to pop in. I saw on or the other Banana Tree branch in London before, but never tried their food \u00a0I decided this had to change. :) I started off with some tofu with some kind of spicy sauce. As main course I selected Nasi Goreng with chicken \u00a0great choice! While the starter was perhaps a bit too spicy \u00a0tasty though \u00a0the Nasi Goreng was very delicious. I was a bit disappointed by the dessert options and went for boring ice cream \u00a0which was good, but I don't need to go there to get good ice cream ;) Overall, really good food, nice interior and good atmosphere, likable music, ranging from chillout piano tunes to some other music that did not offend you but just nicely supported the dining experience. I will definitely go again to a Banana Tree restaurant!",

However, I've learned a good trick to use when coming here: be SUPER nice to your waiter and they will take good care of you! Not just pleasant, but over-the-top nice. Lots of smiles and thank yous will take you far here. I've tried it twice now and have done well both times. Once our waiter even offered to move us to a quieter table when one opened up and we didn't even have to ask!!! It made a world of difference to be honest. That said, the noise issue will not change so if you can tough it out for a great meal, I say GO FOR IT!",

The food is fantastic, but unfortunately this is reflected by the permanent queue that always goes out the door. Always expect a wait on a friday or saturday nights (and possibly other nights also). But it is always worth the wait. The staff are friendly and although, like the others say, it has a wagamamas feel to it with the canteen like benches and fast turnover of tables, it has a very different feel. You never feel like you are being rushed through, and for the most part all your meals come at the same time! The atmosphere is nice, my only advice is try not to be seated right by the kitchen as it can be really noisy and you feel a little like you are in corridor.If you are going for the first time i would recommend that you try the set meal as it comes with all the trimmings and is very well priced.",

The place is littered with great bars and restaurants (yay, right?), but on a weekend, everyone and their granny is trying to get in on the action (sigh). Side bar: And forget about brunch anywhere on a Sunday morning. Everyone else has had the same idea and before you had it.So, yeah, if you choose to dine here on a Friday or Saturday, you will wait outside the Banana Leaf for a table and you will likely have to speak up across the table. The secret is going mid-week. Usually no lines and you get your own table. On any night of the week, you will not be disappointed by the food. Remember slurping is a compliment to the chef!",

The service is quick and it's relatively cheap and cheerful. It's definitely worth adding a Banana Platter of extras to your main - for only \u00a32.50 you get a few extras that turn a light meal into something more well-rounded. The lamb curry was perfectly decent, and the sauce in the fish curry was delicious. One let down, though, was the aubergene curry that was drowning in oil and so tasteless as to be nearly inedible. Maybe this was a one-off, as the rest of the food was fine. I've had better Thai food in London, but Banana Leaf is a nice variation on Wagamamas, isn't too expensive and you can be in and out reasonably quickly. I'd be happy to come back if I needed a quick, cheap eat, although I'll avoid the aubergenes.",

    "text": "The smells emanating from this place are incredibly appetising. This is undoubtedly due to the open plan kitchen and the fact they keep the massive windows open when the weather cooperates. I'd been wanting to go to this place for ages and when my parents came to visit and wanted Thai, I jumped at the chance.Even on a Monday night, the Canteen was packed and we had to wait about 15 minutes (we had a group of 6 so that had an impact too I'm sure). Minor issue was them seating us at a table for 4 which was a bit of a squeeze but we made it. \u00a0Menus were provided immediately and we select a light white from the short wine list. As far as drinks, you are basically looking at half a dozen each for red and white wines, a handful of beers, and the usual vodka or rum well drinks.We started off with lamb lettuce wraps, some chicken parcels, and dumplings. The lamb lettuce wraps is most accurately described a roast lamb salad with the usual crunchy veggies and tasty lamb in a lettuce bowl. Not quite a wrap as I've come to expect but very good flavours nonetheless. The lamb cut into fine slices, marinated in sweet (somewhat like honey bbq with dark soy) sauce and then likely grilled. The chicken parcels were basically ground chicken wrapped in a thin pastry and deep fried. There wasn't much flavour although I quite liked the presentation as they looked just as the name implies. The dumplings were steamed then pan fried for that added crispiness but as far as taste wise were just average.Being a sharing family, we ordered several dishes for the table. We opted for the duck curry, pad thai, special lamb curry, and a fish curry. I have no idea what the thai names are but I can tell you the curries were M3, M5, and M6 (well definitely M something and I think those were the right numbers). The pad thai was exceptional (always the test of a thai restaurant) which crisp crunchy veggies, succulent noodles, and savoury chicken with a solid helping of sliced chillies. I must have knocked out a third of that dish by myself. The lamb curry was tasty although the meat slightly tougher than I would have liked and the dish lacking in colour. The duck curry likewise was tasty and had the added benefit of colourful peppers however only a couple slices of duck. I'm not a huge fan of the thai method of cooking fish which leaves it a bit rubbery (or maybe that's the choice of fish) but my parents enjoyed it.My biggest issue was the portion size. For \u00a38 I expect a larger bowl of curry (it was about the size of a clenched fist) or at least a bit more meat. The small bowls of jasmine rice at \u00a34 a bowl was also a bit of a ripoff. The pad thai was the only generous serving (a full plate) for less than \u00a310.Overall, I liked the tastes and loved the pad thai. I left feeling not hungry but not full either which was a bit disappointing. Banana Leaf Canteen is still one of the best thai options in the area but that's qualified in that there aren't many thai options. I'll keep it in mind when around CJ, otherwise Thai Rice does a better spread.",

Because I was STUFFED from all the other food. It certainly is value for money.I would have enjoyed my Banana Leaf/Tree experience a bit more without the shouting and long waits....",

The staff are ok and the food dishes are reasonably priced. I have only been in the day at weekends but there is always a steady stream of custom. The food is ok, nothing to write home about. I opted for the 'pho' noodle soup with beef and mushroom. It only contained one chewy mushroom and all the noodles were stuck together, although the stock was yummy. Good place for lazy weekend afternoons.",

    "text": "This is a great place to eat in the area as it's reasonable price and the Banana Leaf Meal is a good way of trying a little bit of everything without having to fork out too much as it includes smaller portions of the starters as well as including a main course. My favourite is the spicy nam prik pao or the lemongrass and coriander chicken main, which is sweet but has a special kick to it. The staff are generally fast, polite and friendly however this may be because there is a optional 15 per cent service charge which they add on regardless and question when you don't add it on.Tables are laid out lengthways a lot so you may find yourself sharing with strangers however I have never found this experience unpleasant in Banana Leaf. \u00a0It's very children-friendly and you get lots of families and young people dining here and can get quite busy in the evenings and weekends, however they manage to clear tables pretty quickly so it is worth the 10 minute wait.The best bit about Banana Leaf? The Balinese rice pudding. I have yet to find a better version in any other Thai or Asian restaurant yet. It's just the right side of sticky and the coconut ice cream really complements the texture and sweetens the rice. I find myself craving it for days after.",

I also really like the bun bo chicken salad bowl which is crunchy, healthy and full of flavour. They have a nice variety of fresh juices too.The first time I met a friend here for dinner and it was super busy- we had to queue for about 15 minutes. Once we were seated the food came out quickly. I've also been for lunch a couple of times which was less busy and better value for money, although the service was slower due to an influx of lunchtime deliveroo orders. Overall this place is a really great option if you're after a heathy and filling meal priced at around \u00a310 per person.",

I've also sampled the Laksa and Bun Bo Meaty Salad bowl that the missus ordered; and they're both very nice. The Bun Bo (Xao) meaty salad is just that, a load of veggies served with some grilled beef over a bed of rice noodles and a side of sauce (my best guess is a vinegar/fish sauce/lemongrass mix) that you can pour over the salad bowl to taste. Less is more with the sauce if you've not tried fish sauce before as it can be rather punchy. The Laksa is a delicious blend of Chinese/Malay spicy coconut-curry noodles; pone of my faves!Can't wait to head back to pull myself away from the Chicken Pho and try out the other dishes .",

This staff are friendly, the service is good and most importantly the food is delicious. Great for me as it is halal so I am normally spoilt for choice whenever I look at the menu. The beef pad Thai is my favourite dish. The most recent time I went I tried the saut\u00e9ed beef and dark soya noodles to try something different. It was very nice but the beef was saltier than expected and mixed better with the egg fried rice my friend ordered (we shared most of the food we bought). Overall a great place that also offers lovely fresh juices that are perfect to wash down the meal with. Also highly recommend the sticky wings and chicken dumplings from the starter section. Very tasty!",

I had the Malaysian lamb curry, which arrived in a bowl with lots of lamb and sauce - pretty delicious, although it was not spicy at all, which I had expected and wanted. My partner had the Vietnamese beef pho - and it was in some ways an utter disaster. First, both of our dishes took forever to arrive - in fact, the people who sat next to us arrived 5 minutes after we did, and got their food a good few minutes before us! Secondly, when the pho arrived - they had forgotten to put the beef in it. Luckily, it was swiftly rectified by a new bowl of pho with beef. The pho, however, was probably the most inauthentic one I've seen in London. Firstly, the broth had spicy chilli oil in it - which ruins the clean pho broth taste that is the signature of pho. Secondly, the beef bits were thick and chunky, instead of the thin slices that should be used. Overall, not the best experience there, although most of the food was tasty, the portions good sized, and the prices reasonable. The London Insiderlondon-insider.co.uk",

We ordered the dumplings, spring rolls which came out in good time ( we were starving) and then the Kway Teow Mee which I thought was very well flavored and the Beef Rendang that came with rice and glass noodle salad. Everything was so tasty I wanted more even though I was stuffed. Also got the Iced Tea - which had an extra chai flavour to it (not just condensed milk) and their dessert - Fried Banana Profiteroles and the Pandan Pancake.

    "text": "One of my favourite, everyday, cheap-ish Thai restaurants. The express menu at only \u00a35.95 allows you to dash in & dash out during a busy work day. Don't miss the delicious, authentic Pad Thai & The Legendary Rendang (its legendary for a reason!) The only down side is that they have a tendency to bring you the desert menu at the beginning of your meal in an effort to close the kitchen early & the menu changes so often that the only way to decide is 'ip dip doo'!",
