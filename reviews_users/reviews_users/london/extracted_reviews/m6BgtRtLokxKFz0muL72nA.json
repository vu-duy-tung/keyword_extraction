I mean - if I want a whole dollop of condiments on my piece of fresh crusty baguette - I'd have that. They don't give you those small little jars that wouldn't even fit a teaspoon - they give you proper jars or sweet spreads!I mean..of course it's unhealthy - eating that much sugar, but if you're seeing a friend before they take off to mainland Europe from St Pancras, or it is yourself preparing your tummy for the amazing guilty food at France - I'd strongly recommend. Their coffee is great. That first sip in the morning was just unbelievable - I had goosebumps of how perfect my Americano was. They serve it in weird handless mugs - so that you can hold that bowl and warm your fingers up. My friend loved the cheesecake (can't judge on that - I couldn't have it!). But I did try their selection of nicely served sandwiches - and they were great.I would place this place outside the station - so that you could breath in the amazing London weather before you set off elsewhere. Otherwise - perfect.",

In addition to that the place makes me that I'm having a good healthy meal, no matter what I orderI tried their coffee, Cheese platter, and scrambled eggs and other things too. The coffee is actually very good, the rest is Average. so If you are for the coffee, I think you will be very satisfied. but be careful not to rise your bar of expectation about the rest of the food. Though some family and friends love the food there too, but for me it's an okay food to have every once in a while. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The only thing I would suggest for you while there is to try the different spreads they put in the tables, they are something!",

They had a great selection and breakfast lasted until 12 or 1230 which was great because we left our hotel later than usual and most places stopped at 11. We usually ate outside of the actual restaurant and the service seemed slower, did not bother as much as regular table service might have been on the inside. Which I did not mind, it seemed super stuffy inside also. Our waiter was very helpful in helping me chose my dish. The teapot is way worth it, it is four dollars American, but it fills up two whole cups for two people, and besides they did not even sell tea by the cup. I really recommend the scones, they give you two and they have out preserves and a chocolate sauce on the tables and they give you clotted cream. Definitely a must if you are in the area or are waiting for you tube or train!",

After a trip to the first floor for some photos with the Eurostar trains (and noting the champagne was closed), we were swiftly seated by the staff.I was impressed by the speed of service despite there being a busy breakfast crowd. The menu consisted mainly of French continental breakfast items, a good introduction to the real thing is a few hours. They did stand up well to scrutiny and were aided by some lovely organic jams.They also serve more substantial meals for later in the day but the breakfast bore good comparison with similar offering in Paris.",

The bread is fabulous, just as it should be given that the translation of the name is 'daily bread'. I've thoroughly enjoyed both the Mediterranean and Smoked Salmon Platters, although the addition of sheets of seaweed to the latter was, in my opinion, completely unnecessary and confusing to the overall taste. If you like what you eat, you can always pop next door to the Pain Quotidien shop, where they sell their breads, condiments and cakes, although \u00a316.00 for 2 loaves and 4 little tarts seemed a bit pricey to us. Still, the convenience of knowing that this place will feed you healthy, fresh food if, like us, you've been travelling and would like to be fed before tackling chores such as filling the fridge, is much appreciated by this Qyper, as are the friendly staff and efficient service.",

It is ALWAYS busy during rush hour but you can usually find a seat even if it's at the back of the restaurant which is fine. The food is great, always fresh and usually comes pretty quickly. I just have an issue with the service. I've waited at the door to be seated for 10 minutes before whilst staff chat to each other, clear tables etc. Surely you want to get people seated asap when there's space!? It's not a one off either, the lack of service happens all the time and I had a firm word about it once when I waited 15 minutes at the door and had staff constantly walk past me and half the restaurant was empty. The host shouted at me 'what do you expect we're busy can't you see that', which horrified me. I'm a pretty patient person but I just don't do bad service when it's completely unnecessary. Like a fool I keep coming back but as long as I ask for the bill straight away when my food arrives then I don't have to wait forever for somebody to bring it to me at the end and I'm away relatively quickly. I'd definitely give this place a 4/5 star though if the service was better.",

So when i went to St Pancras to welcome my brother out of the Eurostar i thought i might try it (didn't even know it existed in London before that day).The place is quite big and i appreciated the looks of it. The staff was warm and welcoming. We were placed as we saw fitted (not next to the window, i hate these seats) and my brother's luggages were taken in some convenient place so it wouldn't be a danger for anyone to stumble upon. We both ordered the breakfast menu (croissant/pain au chocolat, assorted breads, jam and chocolate spread, hot beverage, small orange juice) with avocado as an extra.Well i was disappointed. For a total of \u00a321, i expected better. Extra avocado is \u00a31.95 for half of it. The croissant was ok but not fresh (it was 9:30) and my brother couldn't even eat is pain au chocolat because he didn't like it. The breads were good and the chocolate spread really good though (better than nutella i'd swear). Our coffees weren't hot when served so it turned cold real fast and i could finish it. The orange juice seemed fresh and was good. I expected this first experience to be way better. I would not go back as i know where to find better breakfasts for less money anywhere else in London.

Fresh and light and gooey and delicious. What keeps the review at 3 stars is that the rest of the offerings there are pretty standard and in line with other places in the station but at a higher price. The staff are usually friendly and polite, but they're never in any sort of rush (and as I'm always running late in the morning, it's a bit frustrating!).",

Atmosphere is good - it's one of the busiest spots in Pancras, it's warm and cosy and actually right opposite the Eurostar entrance so quite well positioned for a quick bite. Even though it's table service, you can be in and out of here within 20 minutes. Like I mentioned above, food for me was under par - we had two salads. The nicest thing about them was the bread that came with it. Perhaps having a salad in a chain that's actually called \"the daily bread\" isn't a good shout. So yeah, stick with the breaded goods.",

The food was delicious with our party enjoying a variety of Le Pain's egg and pastry dishes and the coffee and chocolate beverages were wonderful as well. In fact the only off-note was the Earl Grey tea which was really rather awful - particularly for London. In short, Le Pain is a great choice for a quick bite at St Pancras while waiting for your train.",

If you are looking for something a bit more English, walk down a bit further to Fortnum & Mason for some tea.It's a great way to ease into the French lifestyle if you are travelling to Paris on the Eurostar. Good selection of teas and coffees. It will get your tastebuds alive, ready for your Parisienne trip at 300km/h.It gets a bit noisy, especially outside in the main station, and it can be a bit disorientating because of all the glass and the two entrances.

The wooden decor gives a cosy feeling to the place. The menu offers a large selection of breakfast options. You can share a basket of various breads and try out their numerous spreads : apricot jam, marmalade, speculoos spread or even white or dark chocolate flavours. You can also order the usual French croissant or a soft-boiled egg. If you are after a light lunch, they serve some delicious soups and tartines with bacon, chicken and all sorts of veggies. You might have to queue for a few minutes as the place is quite popular but they usually serve relatively quickly. They also have large tables if you come with a group, which is quite convenient. There is still enough space around if you do not feel like interacting with your neighbour. If you are in a hurry, you can also buy a croissant, pastry or a sandwich at their store next door.",

Wonderful - perfectly salted and with a little butter, was the best.The ham was crispy and had a wonderfully smoked taste, the eggs done to perfection - and the tomatoes, the things I normally avoid on a breakfast, were even great.Service was quick, a low optional service charge and a nice atmosphere.If I find myself nearby and in need again, I'll certainly be back.",

This restaurant also has family style seating with long wooden tables and chairs. It almost feel like we were sitting in the kitchen. Another perk was there was various jams and jellies available in each table to use on your croissant or bread. There was also a white chocolate spread, that so good (even for breakfast). I also found there are other Le Pain Quotidian's around London and also some in NYC, if you are in the US. It was a pleasant experience and I hope to come back again.",

Not super fast, though, if you have a train to catch.We had a train out of King's Cross but hopped over to St. Pancras to see their food options, which are upscale but less grab-and-go. Le Pain Quotidien is a global chain, so this is probably the third or fourth location I've visited. Prices are higher, but the food quality is also higher. The interior design is homely, clean, lots of bare wood, and some long communal dining tables. We walked in and were seated immediately. The menu is focused and not too extensive. I went with a roasted vegetable salad and wife did the smoked salmon tartine. Everything was delicious, fresh ingredients, and the portions were pretty sizeable. Service was solid. Overall, very nice while waiting for the Eurostar or if you want something upscale coming from King's Cross.",

Went there for breakfast with omelette, croissant and soft boiled eggs. Not forgetting about amazing large cappuccino served in a soup bowl.

The salad was crisp and refreshing, and the bread was great-quality and hearty.Overall, it's a good place for a quality breakfast or brunch.",

Before taking my Eurostar to Brussels, I usually end up at Le Pain Quotidien \"just for sandwiches to go\". I LOVE their mozzarella tomato and avocado one. And also the chicken, spring onion and tomato one.I also usually go out with a hot drink (they have almond milk and matcha latte ! What else ?), a pastry and my sandwiches (the \"official\" goal of me coming in, remember?). It's also a great place to wait for friends and family :) with a fresh mint tea or a hot chocolate or a matcha latte. And some tartines. Well, I love this place :-)",

The waitress carried on checking through the orders despite the fact that I was coughing to death and was clearly in need of some water quickly.The portion sizes were also disappointing and the food was mediocre. I used to think this was a nice place to go but I wouldn't recommend it.",
