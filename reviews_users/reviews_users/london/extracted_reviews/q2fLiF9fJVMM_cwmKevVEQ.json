    "text": "I totally agree with the reviews here. The chargrilled food is excellent. The restaurant has an authentic grill where a poor chef has to barbeque the meat over a very hot fire but the results are amazing. The chicken shish kebabs are extremely well marinated and all the kebab dishes are wrapped in large, flatbread which means you don't get grease or sauce dripping onto your table or worse, your shirt! The waiters can be a bit stressed sometimes do don't be surprised if they're a bit abrupt from time to time. Do check out this restaurant if you're in the area. You can't go wrong!",

    "text": "I must confess that this one is a tough call between 3 and 4 stars. If this had been in any other city I would probably have awarded it a 4, but given that the standard of kebabs and other Turkish dishes in London is quite high, I will be a little strict.I had lived just a few steps away from Cyprus Mangal for a year. But sadly I hadn't discovered this place then. It's a very small restaurant just off Wilton Road ... smaller even than the Nero next door. The entrance is dominated by the kitchen, like in most takeaway kebab shops. But here there is a seating area behind. The menu consists of a somewhat limited Turkish fare. The lamb liver is one dish I would strongly recommend as a starter. The dish was cooked and garnished well. I loved the fried onions that came alongside.For the main course I have tried the various kinds of doner kebabs that they offer. They usually come with some bread, rice and yoghurt. The lamb kebab is very good, but I found, much to my surprise, that the chicken one was probably better. They have a decent wine lisf ... one much more extensive than what I would expect from a restaurant like Cyprus. Besides the standard ones from the European countries, one can find quite a few alternatives from South America or Australia. However I was a bit disappointed at the absence of wine from the middle eastern countries. The food is not pricey at all. The main courses cost ~\u00a38 per plate. One can easily have a filling dinner for \u00a315. It's a good place to try out if you are in the locality.",

The Tavuk Sis with rice is amazing \u00a0well cooked chicken, great flavour, moist but not greasy. Salad and rice taste great. I never get past this on the menu. My colleague goes for the Mixed Grill and positively eulogises over the lamb kebabs.Service is always spot on, the place is modern and clean, the owner is always welcoming and seems pleased to see us, I have got no criticism. I have taken vegetarians and vegans here, they love it also. Even my three year old daughter loves the chicken kebab and chips.If you find yourself walking up Wilton Road and are drawn to the flashier, bigger Kazan, don't. Keep walking and go for Cyprus Mangal.",

It is a Turkish restaurant owned by people from northern cyprus and what I really like is that they serve sucuk. My dad is a great lover of cooking breakfast and it is quite a big deal at my household. A traditional Turkish breakfast will have loads of dishes and sucuk is one of them, for those of you who don't know what it is, it's a red spiced sausage. Though sucuk isn't only for breaky, its good anytime of the day.The last time I dined there, my brother said, get the chops, they are great, so I did and they were succulent and delicious. Everything is of a high standard here, a very good Turkish restaurant. The service is great and to d\u00e9cor to match, it is a small and narrow restaurant but it somehow works. I will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "Found by accident (more of a stumble upon) whilst looking for kebabs. Front of shop is a take away, seemed very popular and busy throughout the time my China and I sat in the back restaurant having our meal. Despite its authentic menu, We were surprised that they had limited themselves to a Doner kebab stack only, I would have liked to have had Chicken Doner. The service was polite, timely and efficient. A single waitress took orders and served the food to every table as though it was her life's mission. (We guessed she was the owner or co-partner) she had a controlling and invested attitude about her. However she was friendly and professional throughout. The back restaurant is small and narrow, but VERY well planned out, there is seating for 30. The food we had was delicious and good value. We ordered a Lamb Shish and a Lamb Doner, both meals arrived with wonderfully tasty side orders of rice and various chopped salads. The flat-bread was nice, but amounted to a single (pre-cut) serving. This seemed a little stingy and should be reviewed, or the offer of more, should one require it. The food tasted fantastic, the Lamb Shish was mouthwatering and cooked to perfection, a little pink inside, nicely grilled on the outside, cooked on a traditional charcoal grill. The Lamb Doner, was tasty and not at all greasy, it was moist, it was seemed to hit every taste bud in just the right way. The side serving of chilli sauce and yoghurt dressings were a delight. The d\u00e9cor was modern and tasteful, almost oriental. The facilities in the basement were very modern and clean. This is a place that is worth a visit or two if you are in the area. It will certainly be on our return list..next time, I am going to ask for more bread.",

    "text": "A good quality kebab is a rare thing in the UK. After a few drinks, I enjoy a pitta stuffed with non-specific meat mass as much as anyone, but when sober, the palette demands something a little more refined. Cyprus Mangal offers tasty nutritious kebabs which can be enjoyed in any state. I often have one for lunch; a small lamb kofta makes for a hearty midday snack full of flavour and meaty goodness. They offer a full range of kebabs including the standard lamb and chicken donner. The lamb donner is not the textureless minced up meat of dubious provenance you normally find in your average kebabiarie, but a glorious glistening tower of slice after slice of marinaded lamb. Kofta's and shish kebabs are grilled and delicately charred over a charcoal pit whih dominates the front of the restaurant. Towards the rear you'll find a tastefully decorated seating area where table service is provided. For a sit down kebabs the menu offers more choice and the kebabs come with a few extra accompaniments and garnish. For takeaway the kebabs come neatly wrapped in flour tortillas with a choice of salad and sauces and can be eaten in the manner of a civilised human being even when on the go. I can't recommend this place enough, it will change the way you think about kebabs.",

I don't know much about the area, but doesn't seem like a place that I'd go to just for this restaurant. The interior is 'middle-eastern night-club owner' style decor, and a little bit cramped. The food was good, nothing amazingly special, and I felt like the portions were a little small. The meat was a little bit too chewy for my tastes (I had the mixed grill plate). We also got the cold-starter plate, to share, which was a bit of a disappointment, though I did like the pink humus (never had that before). Plenty of bread was a plus, and the service was very good (though it was a bit too busy, they could have had one more server, but it would have been too crowded I suppose). Nothing too special, nothing too authentic or unique about the place. It's good, but ultimately forgettable.",

Really good and a large portion. I was by myself so it was too much for one but very tasty and would get it again. I also tried the Turkish Cabernet Sauvignon which was solid.

I got the shwarma. The meat was hot, fresh, well seasoned and delicious, as were the heaps of salads that came with it. The bread, which looked to be a bit mediocre, was smartly grilled up on the fire so it had an delicious smoky taste. We also had a Turkish sausage dish which was spot on.The service was warm and friendly (the guy likes to touch your shoulder when he talks to you), and the pricing was average for London, which is a bit on the high side if you ask me.

I opted for the Mixed Donner to save time as the Ocakbasi was completely full of other customers tasty looking meats already!The Lamb Donner was \"Yaprak\" style and was perhaps the most spiced version I have ever tasted. It was almost like an Indian curry. It was fattier than some of the other places who make Yaprak Doner but still good.The Chicken Donner was overshadowed by the strong flavoured lamb but was nice.The Chilli sauce was spicy hot. The Garlic sauce was fine. Salad & Village Bread wrap were both fresh.Value wise the Mixed Donner was slighty more than you would pay at 'Best Mangal III' for a slightly better Kebab. Having said that, there is no competition in this area so for the quality the price seems worth it.Service was fast & efficient despite the busy lunch time. I asked my server if they had a small printed take away menu he said \"No\", then smiled pointed to the board and joked \"take a picture\".Cyprus Mangal is a top class outlet for kebabs and I will definitely return next time I am Victoria bound to try their other dishes.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

It is conveniently located close to the Victoria Station and pretty easy to find. Even before you set food into the restaurant, you can smell the delicious grill from outside and as you step into the restaurant, you will see the grill kitchen is right by the entrance with various type of kebab ... looking yummy already :) The restaurant deco is toward modern contemporary style which is very welcoming and feel very clean. Had the calamari, hummus, chicken kebab, and lamb stew on this cold cold night and the taste is absolutely outstanding. Very flavorful but not overly seasoned or cooked. The baklava there is probably among the best I had ... it melt as soon as you put into your mouth and not overly sweet , go just perfect with the Turkish coffee. And the service was good, especially in Britishers standard (I went to many places that service was nonexistence). With all the yummy food and on the table and the good service, I would expect the bill to come out to be like 30 some pounds per person but ended up at only 15 pounds per head.... I was WOW.... Highly recommended !!!",

    "text": "This is well-yelped ground at this point, which is how I found it. I stopped in for take-away and went with the lamb shish kebab wrap. The wrap itself, the salad inside, and the garlic sauce are all first-rate. But the star is obviously the lamb, which is really excellent. None of the gristly or over-fatted lamb that gets crammed into wraps all-too-often.It was tender, beautifully cooked over a grill before my eyes, and delicious. I had chips as well, and the whole meal was a great treat.The restaurant itself is a little bit curious: it has a walk-up counter for take-away just inside the door, and that's right up against the grill which serves for the whole place. So the door area is a touch grungy (which is fine by me, if only because it plays to my sense of nostalgia for other places I like a lot), but the restaurant proper actually looks a little swanky. I'll have to come back at some point and try that out. The juxtaposition is kind of funny, but I actually like how well they pull off being a quick \"step in for take-away\" as well as being a mid-level restaurant. Their food is certainly good enough to stand up in both contexts.My only point of complaint is that I had a 15 minute walk home. Aside from having to deal with carrying something that smelled fantastic and not being able to eat it yet, that also meant that the juice from the salad and garlic sauce had pretty well soaked through my wrap. That was a shame, because it meant that it fell apart as I was eating it. Anyway, not their fault at all: I should have gotten it without the wet stuff on top given that I knew ahead of time that it was going to be a bit.",

    "text": "Top 5 shish kabob wraps of my young life, the lamb was succulent, flavorful and down right scrum- diddily- umptous. \u00a0The garlic and chili sauces packed a bit of a punch, and i really liked the addition of a purple cabbage salad to the wrap, added a smooth coolness to the heat and texture of the lamb.The fifth star was awarded for the skillful wrapping. Like Jay-Z of shish wraps, mad skillz, kid. Not a drip of stray sauce or tear to be found in the lavash bread. It was consumable, on street, by hand, with no hassle. That is impressive wrapsmanship.Booyakasha!",

I'm very professional like that.My conclusion? I see your wall-hole and I see your sleek, but why debate d\u00e9cor when the food is this delicious? Truth be told, the venue is nothing special, but the food is fabulous. In fact, the fresh hummus is some of the best I've had. Ever. The tavuk d\u00f6ner was extremely fresh, (words I previously considered oxymorons,) and by aubergine/onion/pepper/tomato/garlic creation was something out of a gourmet dream.While I agree that ambiance is little more than sitting at the back of a kebab shop, the food was something that would have come out of a fancy-schmancy kitchen. One starter, two entrees, and one dessert for \u00a320? I may have to perform research here more often...",

I have faint memories of coming here a long time ago with my friend Clint and having one and thinking it was good, but I guess I'll have to come back and sample once again. Instead, my friend Simone and I went for a set menu, as we were somewhat rushed and had a young toddler with us. I was not impressed with offerings, I'm sad to say, because I know for a fact that there are always queues for the kebabs and they smelt awesome. I don't feel like they do other things well however (having sampled the other things) and the portions aren't that generous. Kazan around the corner however, is awesome (portion size and taste).So, I will endeavour to try the shining star of their menu, this is more just a warning to others. Stick to the kebabs. Meat good. Meze bad.",

    "text": "I've just noticed that the last review for this place was in February, and just wanted to let you know that this place is still good!I've been coming for 3 years and the other reviewers are right - this place is consitently tasty. I've also noticed it's getting busier (3 years ago it was mainly a few locals and some cabbies) and we keep getting asked if we have made reservations. Mmmm...no, as essentially this is a few tables in the back of a kebab shop and we generally decide five minutes before hand that we are going there.We know the menu off by heart and go for a variation on sucuk (sausage), borek (good, but not as good as my own!) or dolmada (vine leaves) to start, and mixed shish to folllow. The mains come with red cabbage, rice, and a tomato salad - satisfyingly large portions. You will also get toasted flat bread served with both a yoghurt and spicy sauce.If you still have room i'd recommend the baclava, and wash it all down with a nice, cold Efes. Two starters, 2 mains, 2 beers, one dessert for less than \u00a330. Brilliant...and you can always take-away. I just fear this place is getting to popular - it may be time for them to expand the premises?",

While visiting London, I wanted to eat something that reminded me of the flavors of the Middle East, and I was a little surprised that there wasn't more eateries that had those flavors. It might've been of the location. I was walking back to our hotel and I smelled the familiar aroma of sizzling fat and mediterranean spices being slow roasted on a vertical pit. I looked through the window and was greeted with a familiar sight. The chef meticulously cutting perfect proportions of juicy chicken falling into a warm pita pocket. The picked vegetables to contrast the fattiness and that unmistakable garlic sauce to elevate it to the next level. I needed to order one and I did. Service was fast, friendly, and if you're looking for a quick bite or a sit-down atmosphere, this place has both to offer.",

    "text": "Years back when I came to London for the first time, I stumbled on Efes, a great Turkish restaurant. It was so good, even better than many places in Istanbul I've been to, so I wondered, is this the limit of human Turkish culinary achievement? Could there be a better place? So it dawned on me to ask the chefs there if there was such a utopia, the Shangri-La of Turkish food. Where do THEY eat?Well apparently they eat at Cyprus Mangal. And it's AMAZING. Cheap, friendly, and ridiculously good food. The kofte is an 8 (and that's only because of the size - it'd be a 9 if there was more meat), the lamb chops (wrapped in fat) are a 9, the grill quail is a 9. Well the bread is a 6. It's not fresh-baked/puffy, it's just grilled and toasty but you know what do you expect. It's okay the rice is great - so just get that if you're a Turkish bread snob.Love love this place - we always go out of our way when we go to London to go to this place. No fanciness or pretention, just super-friendly people and super tasty food that's pretty cheap.",

    "text": "Oh, Cyprus Mangal. Your tabouleh just may be my downfall. But not yet my Achilles Heel.Cause in this review, I'm going to keep it real. Local kebab shop in my old hood. Yeah, Ol' Cyp can push it (ahhh), push it real good! You know, like that song? But alas, I don't want this YelpReview to be long. So let me break it down for ya real quick. The people who serve me are generally pricks. There's just no other way around it. Sorry, that's not nice, but the descrip fits. They act like they don't want my biz.Which is cool, but I'm a regular...no smile or greeting? Gee whiz!Rarely served by someone with their attitude right. Always leave with a bag full of delish food...heated, and ready to fight. Unless absolutely pressed, not my style to throw 'bows. Rather just give 'em a lyrical beat-down with my prose. However, just goes to show. Despite good food, they still need to stay on best behaviour and tippy toes. So while I do recommend CM. Falafel, chicken shish and tabouleh are the creme de la creme. Service needs some work. Because what good is a great local, when it's full of jerks?",
