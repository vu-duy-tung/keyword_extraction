The Tipsy Cake. \u00a0The soft warm brioche soaked in some sort of liqueor was done perfectly, great consistency and just the amount of sweetness. \u00a0Be warned that you may be intoxicated just from the dessert itself... Hence the name I suppose. \u00a0It comes with roasted glazed pineapple that practically melts in your mouth.I would definitely go again for a special occassion.",

The 3 courses were generous, gorgeous, brilliantly executed and generally just awesome. I got the salamugundy, pigeon and tipsy cake, which I would highly recommend, but my decision were heavily swayed by the fact my girlfriend got the meat fruit and the steak, otherwise I probably would have got those two. The tipsy cake was out of this world amazing and the meat fruit was the best foie gras I've ever had (plus amazing bread). I'd definitely recommend getting those two courses, or at least making someone on your table get them and taking some of their's! The main courses were a bit more difficult to choose between but the steak and the reduced sauce it comes with were perfect and is the best steak I've ever had, and the pigeon was more delicate than I've had before and was a bit more like quail texture than usual, but still tasted amazing.We finished things off by splitting some liquid nitrogen ice creams and a little ganache with coffee.Overall, I had high expectations and it smashed them out of the park. It wasn't really that expensive either really, it was about \u00a3100 a head for 3 courses, plus wine, a cocktail each, ice cream, and coffee - I know I've spent more on much less! Save. Go. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I was excited to score reservations at the \"#7th Best Restaurant in the World,\" by Heston Blumenthal, the same chef behind the Fat Duck. The restaurant is housed in the Mandarin Oriental hotel, and it definitely feels like a hotel restaurant, with a somewhat corporate and sleek vibe. It seems like a better place for a business dinner than for an intimate date.Through a mix-up in our appetizer order, we were graciously allowed to sample 3 of their appetizers: Meat Fruit, Savoury Porridge, and Frumenty.The Meat Fruit is as wonderful as they say. A foie gras pate molded into the shape and appearance of a mandarin orange and presented with toast. I have to say I was more excited about how dead-on this foie gras resembled an orange than I was with the actual taste of the appetizer. The Frumenty was also very good, probably the best seared octupus I've had. Only the Savoury Porridge fell flat: an ill-fitting concoction of frog legs, shaved radish, and porridge that didn't really seem to belong together or meld in any comprehensible way.For entrees I had the pork chop and she the duck. The pork is a massive, hulking chop that is lined generously with fat. I kind of felt like a caveman eating it. It's served alongside this cabbage / ham hock creation that I felt was more delicious than the main.And desserts: I placed my order for the Tipsy Cake when I ordered at the beginning. It's essentially this brioche cake that's been soaked in brandy and then served alongside this perfectly whittled, grilled slice of pineapple. One of the best desserts I've had in a long time.All the items on the menu hearken back to some element of Britain's culinary history, so each item will have a date of its origin / genealogy as well, which was very cool. (The Meat Fruit is actually from the 16th century, so I tried to channel King Henry VIII as I was eating it). I think I paid something around GBP125 which seemed very reasonable for a dinner of this caliber. Our waiter was very gracious and the service immaculate. If you find yourself in London, definitely make arrangements to dine here.",

What I love most is that even though the setting is posh, the staff are so lovely and make you feel like you've been there before and you are all old friends. No pretentiousness or stuffiness at all. Food is amazing! Menu based on Old English style food. The Meat fruit was as I expected. Fantastic, melt in your mouth! yummmm....Would love to eat there every week, but alas, it's a bit on the pricey side. Although not as pricy as The Fat Duck. The waiting list seems more managable than The Fat Duck too. Defo recommend if you can!",

Of course I could say that never in my life have I experienced service as fantastic as I did at 'Dinner', and that me and my companion were near doted on my the staff who buzzed around ensuring everyone was well looked after.

The only thing I did not dig was the jelly fish looking light covers they have on the wall. But that is a minor minor minor detail. Meat Fruit: exceeded my expectations and then some. I've read all these reviews about how the meat fruit was amazing and indeed, it was spectacular. A true work of art. The creamy smooth parfait contrasted with the slight tang of the mandarin skin. How does he do it? I need more grilled bread to spread this goodness on. Other appetizers: I had bites of my friends' roast marrowbone and lobster cucumber soup. The marrowbone was not my favorite, did not like the flavors in it. The lobster soup however was great, huge chucks of lobster. Powdered Duck Breast: I am such a sucker for duck breast, especially when it's done to perfection. Tender, great flavors and not to mention, quite filling. A definite winner in my books. Tipsy Cake: It's like eating sweet delicious clouds. No idea how Heston got the brioche to be so fluffy and light. A must order. I suggest getting a side of ice cream as it goes together perfectly with the warm brioche and spit roasted pineapples. Liquid Nitrogen Ice cream: What can I say, I love liquid nitrogen so of course dessert #2 for me. It's much more of a novelty and a show but so worth it. Top off the cone with some popping candy and it is a party in your mouth. Seriously Heston, Thanks for such a great meal.",

The service was great, as you would expect from a restaurant of this standing. The food was also very, very good but it somehow felt a bit outdated. The concept is that they take some classical dishes and then put a modern twist on it. That was exactly where maybe our expectations and reality was a bit off. We enjoyed the food, but it missed some excitement. The meatfruit, some pat\u00e9 in the form of a mandarin, is a nice trick but it left us wishing there was more. The snail porridge was very good, that was one of the highlights of the meal. The main courses (we had lamb and roasted pork) were all perfectly executed, but again I would have loved a bit more surprise. The real highlight of the meas were the desserts. Overall a great restaurant and nice experience, but I would have hoped for a bit more excitement, especially since this is Heston Blumenthal. Other restaurants offer more innovative spin on the food.",

    "text": "I've recently been to Heston's new restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in London. We literally booked months in advance to get a lunch seating not too long after it opened. I may got shot for saying this, but the food was...okay. Don't get my wrong, parts of it were good - but not the amazing I was expecting. Not to mention the extortionate prices. Of course, one must try this restaurant once and I would surely go back for the 'tipsy cake'. The meat fruit (starter) was indeed tasty (who doesn't like a bit of liver?!), and the concept itself, creative but the portion in relation to the bread provided was too much and quite rich for a starter. I'm all for value for money, and obviously scoffed this down. The consistency was just right and the outer 'mandarin' skin really did taste fruity with a hint of citrus that went well and complimented the liver.I had read a review on Yelp which highly recommended the pork chop (as opposed to the Beef Royale) which many raved about. The portion was a good size and the meat was tender (not tough or dry) and well seasoned and cooked. The sauce that accompanied it was tasty from memory, but for the life of me, I can't quite remember if it was salty or citrus-y.Now, the dessert. When I read 'salted caramel' I though 'YES, that is exactly what I want'. I know the 'tipsy cake' had been recommended by others, but I am super sensitive to alcohol, i.e. I can detect it in a slice of tiramisu so I decided to rebel against the consensus. I also don't like the taste of booze so that was that. The waiter warned me my choice was a 'savoury' dessert...yet I still went for it. A mistake. It has this extremely bitter taste and then came the lovely salted caramel as an after taste which was nice. But I just couldn't get over how bitter it was. I think I still ate the whole thing, but not to my enjoyment. The meal ended with an 'earl grey tea' ganache which was to die for, and I did get to sample my sister's 'tipsy cake' which was lovely spitroasted pineapple with the most deletable brioche. I highly recommend it.So was it nice? yes. Was it the amazing I was expecting? Not quite - but nonetheless an experience which must be tried once and perhaps only once.",

Towards the end of the meal he completely disappeared and we ended up having to call over another after we sat for 20 minutes without any water or the check. The service was fine otherwise. For the starter we ordered the meat fruit which is a must. The gelatin didn't really add any taste and the liver was creamy and rich. The waiter brought us some more bread as well, I don't know how you could use the whole thing on just one slice. For my main I got the pork chop which was cooked well and very flavorful. The side of spelt with roberts sauce was also enjoyable. The portion size was large enough to almost fill me up. For desert I had to get the nitrogen ice cream cart. It's definitely not worth the 8.50 or 17.00 because the minimum is 2 but it's one of those experiences I knew I had to have. The cone was the best part, the ice cream and toppings weren't anything special. I would most certainly get a different desert if I was to return. The little chocolate and caraway biscuit they give you at the end is a nice touch, I'm not a fan of caraway seed but the chocolate was very good.",

Over the years I have had some pretty shocking experiences at restaurants owned by famous chefs. And after a series of bad experiences, I must admit, I became a bit jaded. Does a famous owner really mean the restaurant will be great or is it simply a badging exercise to inflate the prices and create a bit of buzz for the hotel it inhabits? Until I visited Dinner by Heston, I was beginning to believe the latter. But Heston, you have changed my mind. It's not cheap and it's quite difficult to get a reservation, but just get over it and put a note in your diary to ring for a reservation (respectively). I stared with the famous Meat Fruit - a fantastic illusion. Yes, it's a pate in the shape, colour and texture of a mandarin orange. There's quite a lot of it, and it's rich as hell, but somehow when you finish, you still want just a bit more. I then moved on to the sweetbreads (i have a thing for sweetbreads). They were amazing - perfectly tender and seasoned. I could not have asked for anything more. I finished with the Brown Bread Ice-cream. I'm not always a huge dessert person so this being a slightly savoury dessert suited me just fine. I can't claim to have studied the wine list. Instead we simply asked the sommeliers for a bit of help. We had a series of fantastic wines - sparkling, white, red and finally a sweet. Finally, the service was absolutely impeccable. Sometimes service can be stiff or overbearing, but this was refreshingly polite yet casual. It was the way modern service should be with mutual respect between diners and wait staff. They were knowledgable and could tell you the history of each dish in great detail (impressive). So along with a lovely dinner, we got a bit of a history lesson - win/win.",

It's delicious and amazing.2) The Tipsy cake - hard to describe. Just get it. You will not be disappointed! The main courses were also very well done. I had the scallops and my wife had a ribeye steak with mushroom ketchup and tripple fried chips. Both were prepared extremely nicely and were delicious.So glad we made it here!",

    "text": "I've always admired Heston Blumenthal from the countless YouTube videos I've seen of him taking a scientific (literally) approach to food. On my most recent trip to London I had the pleasure of dining at Dinner... except I came for lunch... Lunch @ Dinner (hah)!Decor: The restaurant is located inside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel which should be self explanatory in itself. For those of you who don't know the Mandarin Oriental, just think of the Ritz-Carlton, then take it up a notch. There were two things that really stood out about the interior of the restaurant: 1. The glass walls which surrounded the kitchen allowing you to take a glimpse inside, and 2. the modern see-through wine-cellar which stood at the entrance of the dining area. Service: Each table does not have its own server, rather there is a large amount of staff constantly attending the floor. This allows for both quicker ordering and a shorter-wait time between check-ups. The service at dinner was quite outstanding and the pleasant attitudes of the servers brightened up what was a very gloomy day outside.Food: Meat Fruit - The presentation of the meat fruit is both clever and beautiful. The meat fruit itself is very strong in flavor, but spread it on the nicely toasted bread and you have yourself a savory little starter. I would highly recommend this for everyone.Tipsy Cake - The second most popular item at Dinner behind the Meat Fruit. This triple-reduced pineapple cake is possibly the single sweetest/richest pastry I've ever encountered. Would highly recommend a nice glass of bitter espresso to go with this. If you are a sweet lover, this is a must!Roast Iberico Pork Chop - I don't remember much about this dish, but I do remember that I thought the vegetables were more amazing than the pork chop itself. Overall: Although not the most incredible meal of my life, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal is all-deserving for the praise and accolades it has achieved. Great service, beautiful interior, and good food gives this place a certain 5/5.",

I was excited to share the meal with 2 friends this time, allowing us to sample many more dishes than when I dined alone. Things I love about Dinner? An attentive, friendly and non-stuffy staff...their unique approach to food, updating old school recipes with a modern day twist...a casual atmosphere....plate-licking-good food (okay, you probably shouldn't really lick your plate)...and reasonable prices, at least when compared to American Michelin-Starred restaurants. If you are in London...I highly recommend that you treat yourself to a meal at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. You can thank me later.",

We arrived well before our time slot, to sit at the bar and hope that another reservation may not arrive. Unfortunately we were unlucky but had a great time sampling the amazing, unique cocktails, one using chilli oils. The bar staff were great to start but soon dwindled and we were forgotten about, having to grab their attention on many occasions.We were then seated at the exact time slot. The waitress was great and they even remembered my conversation on the booking advising that one of us was a vegetarian and happily talked through the menu making suggestions to suit.The sommelier then arrived and he had to be the highlight of the night. He made us feel so relaxed, but also made us constantly laugh and smile. However, more importantly, he was extremely knowledgable and talked through different options we could try to match.Now the important bit, the food. The classically famous meat fruit. A lot bigger than I imagined with incredible flavour. I would say that there was at least one of these going to every table and would highly recommend trying it. The main was a ok but very forgettable.Overall the experience is something you wont't forgot anytime soon, but does it warrant the high prices. I don't think it does. Would I could back? Probably not, I believe it's a one time only 'special occasion' venue. (Visit - 28/07/2015 Dinner)",

The restaurant is located inside the Mandarin Oriental and it is conveniently located near the metro/tube/underground. If you take the Picadilly line to Knightsbridge you'll end up right there.The meat fruit is their signature dish and you must try it if you like foie gras. Not knowing what it was going to look like, I was totally surprised to see some crostini and a Mandarin orange on a wooden cutting board. (I wonder if they chose the mandarin orange because they are situated in the Mandarin Oriental... clever)At first I was like, where is the foie gras that was listed in the menu? Upon closer inspection, the orange \"rind\" is actually a gelatin like substance and the foie gras is inside! It was a pleasant surprise and was an amazing dish. My wife and I also shared the octopus which was good, but I think the Meat Fruit totally shined over it.For mains we got the duck and pigeon. The pigeon was suggested by one of the servers and I'm glad my wife got it. It's not something we would usually pick, but he was spot on. Juicy, delectable, tasty. Everything was cooked perfectly. For dessert we got the cheesecake and by suggestion of the servers, we also ordered the tipsy cake at the beginning of our meal. If you like monkey bread, you'll love tipsy cake. It was so good, I wish we got two so my wife and I could have our own. The restaurant is nice and you can see right into the kitchen, which is cool. It is expensive, but being from the United States, everything in London is expensive due to the strength of the GBP. I'd still go back regardless.",

I loved the sauce which the waiter described as \"butter\" so I guess I like butter. We did get amazingly bored waiting for the main dishes. At about the same time we started \"napkin origami\" the food came, maybe 75 minutes after sitting down. Wife had chips with her rib eye. Rib eye was salty and nothing special. Chips were underwhelming. I would expect something creative but guess not. In 'n Out fries in the US still win. \u00a0He should check them out.",

I recommend requesting to be seated at a table by the kitchen if you'd like this extra experience because there are several tables that can't see the kitchen. The atmosphere lost one star for me because I prefer fine dining restaurants to have dimmer lighting. The lighting was a bit bright for my liking which causes the noise levels to rise slightly, and gives the restaurant a more casual feeling than I expected. Service: 5/5 our server was charming, friendly, helpful, and very attentive! We took his recommendation on nearly every dish we ordered and we were happy that we did! The sommelier was knowledgable and helpful as well. \u00a0Food: 5/5 nothing bad to say here! We came in with high expectations and were not disappointed! For starters we ordered the Meat Fruit (which I saw other yelpers recommend) and it was phenomenal! The presentation was truly a piece of art. We also ordered the Salamagundy, which was quite good, but I preferred the Meat Fruit. For our main course we had the Bone in Rib of Hereford Prime cooked medium rare. The steak was delicious! It was cooked perfectly and had a great smokey flavor. The sauce served with it was a bit tangy, sweet, infused with some spices, but light and really brought out the flavor of the steak. Perfect pairing there! It also came with fries and a mushroom ketchup. The ketchup was very unique, but tastey! For dessert we ordered the Tipsy Cake and the Brown Bread Ice Cream. The Brown Bread Ice Cream was good and well presented, but the caramel was a little over powering for me. The Tipsy Cake was the best part of the entire meal for me (I'm a dessert person!) I would come to this restaurant again just for this dessert; it was that good! The \"cake\" was served hot in a small pot with a slice of pineapple on the side. At the bottom of the pot was where I found my little piece of heaven! A delectable vanilla, rum sauce soaking into the bottom of the cake! Wow!Overall: 5/5 all of my high expectations were met (minus the small detail of the lighting, which isn't too big of a deal for most). I will most definitely come back next time I'm in London!",

But so was the packet of smoked salmon I got from sainsburys the other day. After waiting about 30 mins (the wait staff did apologise) for the main of pork belly I was not impressed. It was not slow cooked. The skin was still fatty. I couldn't eat it. The wait staff did offer the fish dish but by this stage I was over it. Amazing service (although it took forever) but the food was a major let down. And for the price i'd never return.",

But really a wonderful experience..It's a lovely spot and walking in you immediately know you've arrived someplace special. We had a window table with a view of the park that was ideal. Service tops! All who came to our table were friendly and helpful.We started with meat fruit which everyone else had raved about, and they were right. The presentation was amazing, it looked like an orange! I also loved the salamuguy, chicken oysters in a horseradish sauce. Could have been my meal.I enjoyed my dinner of roast turbot, but not the mushy vegetables served with. But I am told that's standard fare in England. The side dishes of peas and grebe beans were not mushy so more to my liking.And then dessert! Must have Tipsy cake again sometime. Order at the start as it takes 40 minutes to bake. So worth it!If I could afford this I would go again. For now my memories, and the menu they let me take, will have to keep my belly full.",

    "text": "In case you couldn't tell, the meat fruit is an essential dish to try here. (c.1500: \u00a0Mandarin, chicken liver & foie gras parfait with grilled bread, \u00a317.50) It tastes and looks amazing. The smokiness of the grilled bread perfectly complements the almost sweet richness of the liver/foie gras and orange gel. Really great. I would be happy just coming here for this one dish and calling it a day. So great!We ended up spending so long at the Tate Modern before lunch that our friends, who were heading in the same direction, decided they'd try to join us. Despite the last-minute change, we asked if they could accommodate 4 instead of the original 2 for lunch and they graciously informed us that yes, luckily there was an open table. (Thankfully it wasn't a busy lunch.) Service was excellent, as was the food and cocktails. I'll definitely be back. Pricey, but worth it. I love being able to see into the kitchen and watch different dishes being prepped. Earl Grey Tea cured Salmon (c.1730: Lemon salad, gentleman's relish, wood sorrel & smoked roe for \u00a316.00) was another great dish - the lemony tea smoke flavor and the salmon were perfect together. The historical aspect of this restaurant was what first drew me to it, and I'm glad it did. It's a great concept, and expertly executed.",

    "text": "This is not an orange. \u00a0It's FOIE GRAS.If that's not enough to pique your appetite, I don't know what will. I've never been one to jump up and down at the prospect of foie gras, but the very idea of stuffing a mandarin with the stuff is insanely creative and will titillate even the most stubborn tastebuds.Be warned it is ridiculously difficult to get a reservation. The only time they had available all month was 9:45pm on a Wednesday. We jumped on it and had no regrets.There seem to be two things you should always order here: the meat fruit (foie gras) appetizer and the tipsy cake. I abhor the \"wisdom\" of crowds sometimes, but in the case of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, the crowd WINS. You should absolutely conform to popular opinion and get the foie gras and the tipsy cake. I'm a sweets person, so the tipsy cake was a freaking mindblower. It takes like creamy vanilla bread pudding, but infinitely better because of the pineapple side and the warm crispy, crunch, creaminess of it all...For my main I got the duck. I think I got lucky because it proved phenomenal. The side of blood was DELICIOUS... and I say this without cringing or the least bit of irony. It was a perfect complement to the duck, which was crispy on the outside and absolutely juicy and smoky delicious on the inside. Just make sure you cut against the grain (I'm one of those knife noobs who always forgets how to use the knife because I usually stick to veggies and hot carbs). \u00a0Speaking of carbs, not only did I order the tipsy cake, but I went all in and got a nitrogen ice cream as well. \u00a0They come around with a trolley to whip up the ice cream in front of you, spinning this machine that shoots fog out (see it to believe it). I'm not sure if I'm enamored with nitro ice cream like the rest of London, but it was quite an experience watching our server make the ice cream from scratch, explaining how it's done. The ice cream itself is only one flavor (vanilla), but you can choose 2/4 toppings (I went with the nuts). The thing about nitrogen ice cream is that it is SO cold but will melt fast, so you better lap it up quickly.All in all, the service was impeccable. Our servers were very friendly, engaging with us in conversation about where they were from and where we were from, German accents and such. Wonderful experience.",

    "text": "A dinner out in London on our multi-part trip around the UK, we were very excited to eat at Heston Blumenthal's flagship restaurant in the Mandarin hotel in London. We were particularly excited due to the historical creative roots that he derived the menu from. The restaurant guests were primarily a mix of romantic couples, business associates, and a smattering of vastly under-dressed tourist families. The staff were at first worryingly young for such a highly praised eatery, but we found them to be delightfully professional, knowledgeable, and charismatic throughout the meal. The food was fantastic, the oxtail and rice was delightful, the cocktails from Mandarin's bar also great. A great standout dish was the mashed potatoes, so buttery and creamy they have ruined our expectations of mashed potatoes forever. Our only complaint was the kitchen's 'extra' treat of some pudding and biscotti that was too eerily similar to a Jell-O Pudding Cup.In hindsight this was the only restaurant on our UK trip that were trending with top places in the US, whereas fine-dining in the other parts of the UK were still smearing pastes on your plate or serving sorbets, Blumenthal was embracing the quality and energy that make it stand out in a sea of obsolesce. And although it doesn't have the pomp of a 13 course meal at Eleven Madison Park or the inventiveness of the now-defunct WD50's molecular gastronomic concoctions , it does deliver on dishes that shine fantastically on their own.Overall, the highlight of our London trip, amazing food, great staff, and fantastic value. Eat well, drink the Mandarin cocktails (forgo the wine), and enjoy possibly the best restaurant in the British Empire.",

    "text": "Dinner definitely deserves its 2 Michelin stars. Located in the Mandarin Oriental, the ambiance is sophisticated, yet relaxed and not stuffy. Glass encases the plethora of wine bottles on both sides as you enter, as well as the kitchen for you to peek into as they do their magic. The menu is a modern take on original British dishes. I'm going to sound like a broken record, but yes indeed, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not getting the meat fruit! I've had quite a bit of p\u00e2t\u00e9 in my life--this sits in the #1 spot! Covered in a mandarin jelly, this smooth chicken liver melts in your mouth and leaves a lasting impression. The lobster & cucumber soup is delectable as well, with a light consistency and flavors that blend well together. The cod in cider is one of the best fish dishes I've ever had. The cod falls apart and has a beautiful buttery flavor. It pairs well with the chard and smoked artichokes. The Hereford ribeye is a solid choice. I found it to be somewhat chewy, but the beef is of the utmost quality. Their triple cooked chips are essentially very crispy fries. The mushroom \"ketchup\" is interesting! If you're up for dessert, don't think about it, just get the tipsy cake--make sure to order it at the beginning of your meal. This unassuming dessert is really something that blew me away. It is one of the best little desserts I've ever had. Their liquid nitrogen ice cream station is interesting to observe, but it melts quickly! Just a few toppings to choose from, but there is a strawberry preserve treat at the bottom of the cone that's a nice touch and excellent last bite to an excellent meal. Service is outstanding of course. Portions aren't huge, but neither are the prices--for the 7th best-ranked restaurant in the world, that is.",

Starters: The meat fruit, Frumenty and Earl Grey tea cured salmon.The meat fruit was definitely the star of this course. It was perfectly presented. The foies gras was smooth and luscious. The grilled octopus, the \"Frumenty\" was fresh and tender but the general taste of the dish was nothing you would not be able to find in a good seafood tavern in a Mediterranean country. That said, I've found it difficult to find well-cooked octopus in this country so they still deserve their five stars. The salmon was very fresh and mouthwatering.Main: Powdered duck breast and chicken cooked with lettuces. I wasn't a fan of the chicken. However, the duck was divine. It was cooked to perfection, well-seasoned and scrumptious. Just perfect. Desserts and tea: Tipsy cake, Brown bread ice cream, Chocolate bar and Sambocade. There was a great selection of teas, I'd recommend the rose tea. The tipsy cake was absolutely gorgeous. You'd have to pre-order it as it takes 40 minutes to prepare. However it is one of the best desserts I have ever had. For an ice cream addict like myself, the brown bread ice cream was average. The chocolate bar and ginger ice cream were good but the bar was a bit too overpowering. The Sambocade was different and worth trying but a dessert I would only order once, not my favourite. They also serve ice cream made with liquid Nitrogen which they prepare by the table which adds a great twist and is entertaining to watch. I would definitely return to Dinner and I'd definitely recommend: the meat fruit, powdered duck and tipsy cake.",

    "text": "I was looking very much forward to my dining experience at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. Many have touted several mainstay menu items as \"unique, must-haves\" so I had to check it out for myself.I would say the food and the overall experience were solid, but not mind-blowing. All the dishes were plated and constructed perfectly, but perhaps my tastebuds are tired of \"textbook\" meals and yearn for the x-factor. I'm not saying that I want all of my dishes to look haute cuisine or something straight out of a science-fiction movie. I just like the flavor profile of what I eat, especially when I'm doling out big bucks, to be a bit imaginative. This is where I would take corporate clients or a sexy date to. Especially if you're trying to impress with the brand. On the other hand, this is not the place I would take my most well-travelled, self-proclaimed foodie comrades. Some tips:Try: the meat-fruit - it looks pretty and the \"orange skin\" introduces a nice citrus taste to a smooth pate Try: the tipsy-cake dessert (must be ordered at the start of the meal)Try: the pork tenderloin if you're a meat-lover and are looking for a substantial dishResos: book well in advanceDress: business casual at the least",

    "text": "We came here for lunch with a party of 5 and basically were able to share most things on the menu. \u00a0They discouraged doing multiple appetizers (instead of the standard appetizer, main, dessert format), but in the end, we made it work out.They have a 3 course lunch menu for \u00a340, but I don't think you get the proper experience with this, so we went a la carte. \u00a0On the menu, you can see the origins of each of the dishes (year, source), and it's crazy to me that a recipe from the 13th century can be so relevant to modern tastes. I like food history, so exploring the menu here was a lot of fun for me.Starters: 1. Meat fruit: chicken liver parfait in an orange exterior to make it look like a perfectly shaped tangerine. It's served on a beautiful dark wood board with grilled bread. The liver itself was rich and savory, and the grilling of the bread helped with texture2. Rice and flesh: saffron rice that's very yellow, nicely al dente, with calf tails, which had a good braised beef flavor3. Salagamundy: chicken oysters, salsify (love this), bone marrow, and a horseradish cream. This dish had a lot going on and was very unique 4. Savoury porridge: the frog legs are fried, and the porridge itself was the highlight for me - it's bright green, garlicky, slightly acidic, and very satisfying 5. Roast scallops: there were actually lots of greens on this dish, which I appreciated (roasted cucumber, broccolini), and the sauce was a cucumber ketchup Mains: 1. Roast Iberico pork chop: perfectly cooked (\"to its natural color.\" It was super tender but rich in flavor, and it came wth a ham hock and then chicharrones, which made it a very rounded out pork dish. The jus was so flavorful. 2. Chicken cooked with lettuces: it's probably one of the best chicken breasts I've had. It's been brined and then slow cooked so that it's ridiculously tender. \u00a0The skin is crisped outside and almost like it was de-fatted. The lettuces were ok, but the charred onion emulsion and chicken juices were very rich in flavor, and I soaked up every last bit of the sauceSides: 1. Fries: more like American fries2. Triple cooked chips: rectangles of fried goodness. These were so well seasoned and so crisp and battery outside but not dry at all inside. These are some of the best fries I've hadNote: the potatoes come with a house mushroom ketchup, which is pretty amazing (even though the chips were great on their own)Desserts:1. Tipsy cake: order this ahead. Think of a boozy brioche sort of bread pudding in a cast iron pot with spit roast pineapple on the side. It's enough for 2 people to share, but I wouldn't split it with more than that. If only all bread pudding tasted like this..2. Brown bread ice cream: the ice cream itself wasn't as strong as I expected, and the salted butter caramel kind of dominated. I thought this was just ok 3. Liquid nitrogen ice cream: we saw the cart go by and added this on. It's definitely a showy dish where they wheel the cart over and hand churn liquid nitrogen vanilla ice cream for you. The cone is super thin and light, and the ice cream is rolled in your choice of toppings (I had apple pop rocks, freeze dried raspberries, and chocolate bits).They finished us up with chocolate pudding and caraway biscuits. The biscuits are like shortbread, and the pudding is so smooth. The two go very well together.We were initially a bit put off by their discouragement of how we were trying to order, but all of the food was spot on in terms of execution and highlighting traditional / historic British food.  We had a very a nice, longer leisurely lunch overlooking Hyde Park on a nice fall day. \u00a0Reservations were made on Open Table. \u00a0Even though it's a good value, I'm so glad we did not get the 3 course set lunch.",

    "text": "It's been a few weeks since my lunch here but I am still quite speechless. The meal I had at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal is high up there on my list of best dinning experiences.I was a bit nervous when I first arrived at the Mandarin Oriental, which completely exudes Knightsbridge pretension. But once I stepped into the actual restaurant, it was simply British elegance...an overly polite and warm staff, modern interior design, and great views of Hyde Park. I already knew it was going to be a great lunch, but the dishes delivered all the way. The restaurant's concept is to modernize historic/ancient British dishes taken from actual recipes that were found at British Museum and British Library archives. So every item on the menu had a real historical basis, and the wait staff provide a history lesson for each dish after you finish the course! There was a set lunch menu, but I opted to order a la carte. First course, seared scallops with \"cucumber ketchup\". This pretty much sets the standard for all scallop dishes. Deconstructed cucumber and the herb colored ketchup work well with the scallops. A distinct but surprisingly fitting coupling. Cod in Cider for main course. The cod was seared golden on the outside, \u00a0flaky and butter-like in texture. The cider sauce was thick, almost like a Bechamel sauce. The smoked artichoke hearts in the dish could have easily stood out as its own side dish. (And I am normally not an artichoke fan!) After the two heavy courses, I wasn't sure about a dessert as tempting as many of them were...so my waiter suggested the nitrogen ice cream made at the table side. We've had history lessons, and now there was a show too! I also had a lemongrass tea, a very appropriate British ending a most delightful meal. In lieu of a amuse bouche at the beginning of the meal, they offered a mini chocolate mousse with biscuit at the end of the meal. A young French sommelier recommended excellent wine parings for the starter and main course. \u00a0The whole waitstaff was keenly observant and they anticipated all my needs without being intrusive.Dinner at Heston Blumenthal offers the best of British dinning, and is every bit deserving of its two Michelin stars and title as 5th World's Best Restaurant. I look forward to dinning here again.",

Thanks for advising us earlier \u00a0 \u00a0Not once during our entire meals did Anyone come to our table to ask if we were enjoying our meal. \u00a0When the best food item was the bread, you know this restaurant is in big trouble. \u00a0We could go on but why? \u00a0If you don't get it by now, you never will. \u00a0The bottom line is this--if you want to get ripped off with marginal food and poor service, this is the place for you.",

Although it was cloudy and rainy out, the large windows overlooking the park added just the right touch to the cozy ambiance. Service was warm and friendly.....and impeccable until \u00a0ice was poured all over me and the table. They were very apologetic and even offered us complimentary ice cream cones from the cart.Meat fruit = Amazing! This is a must try and ideally should be shared as it is quite rich and creamy. No question that it looks exactly like a mandarin orange. If only they made the leaves edible as well!The bone in rib was cooked just right. I was a bit concerned when they recommended medium but the meat was perfectly cooked and well seasoned.Tipsy Cake- I did not know what to expect with this dessert and I am not a huge fan of alcohol cakes. I was pleasantly surprised by the light flavors and pull-apart pillows of goodness. The pineapple was quite scrumptious as well.If you haven't had enough sweets, go for the ice cream cart which is off menu.

I don't remember the quirky names they had on the menu, but if I could dine here all over again, I'd definitely re-order: rose champagne, chicken/bone marrow appetizer, lobster in cucumber soup appetizer---OUTSTANDING. (Also good, though not amazing, were the mandarin chicken pate and oxtail risotto). Between the pork chop and the ribeye, definitely get the pork chop. It's prepared perfectly. \u00a0And comes with thrice cooked chips. Perhaps the most amazing fries I ever had in my life, I kid you not. Perfectly crispy on the outside and sooooo soft on the inside. And for dessert, definitely get the pineapple brioche---equally outstanding as the appetizers above. We were given complimentary strawberry sorbet and chocolate ganache, both very good too.",

We found this place because we want to go somewhere that has a British favor to it (not just another French fine dining place). I got the meat fruit for appetizer, the angus steak for entree, a side of fries, and Sambocade for dessert. The meat fruit was hands down one of the most memorable dish I've ever had in my life. The Sambocade was amazing - I've never had goat cheese in my cheesecake before, and it blends so well. My boyfriend got the rice and flesh for appetizer (his favorite of the meal), cod in cider for entree, and the tipsy cake for dessert. We both loved everything we had. Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here.

The atmosphere was one of the liveliest I've seen for a restaurant of this caliber. Bordering on rowdy. But it wasn't obnoxious at all, if anything it added to the fun. We ordered several dishes (sadly, I don't recall any of them that were mind-blowingly special, but I do remember all of them were amazing in taste and texture). The ice cream truck is a spectacle to behold, and I'd recommend getting some of the home-made ice cream from this truck, which they make right at your table. I also loved their selection of teas from around the world, including Fujian province, Iran, and various parts of Japan. If you're in London go. You won't regret it.",

I felt cared for the entire time. We started with meat fruit. Creamy, tangy, and slightly sweet. Perfect for spreading on the grilled bread. When we finished half of our fruit and all of our bread, they offered to bring us a few more slices. For our main course we shared the powdered duck breast with smoked confit fennel and umbles. The meat was extremely tender and juicy. It almost melted with each bite. There was an additional piece of meat on our plate, which I afterward learned was duck heart. Oh my. Well, it did taste good. To finish we selected a dessert from the set lunch menu, Sambocade. It is a goats milk cheese cake with elderflower and fresh fig. Again, my main description is creamy, tangy, and slightly sweet. It had a light fruit filling, a dark coating (ash?), and several halved figs. We learned that this recipe is one of the oldest printed recipes in Britain, c.1390. We were tempted by the ice cream, made table-side with liquid nitrogen, but decided to pass. But that wasn't the end of our dining experience. Our waiter brought out two complementary shot glasses of dark chocolate mousse, infused with earl grey, and caraway biscuits. The flavors paired surprisingly well, as did the textures. This one will be hard to beat.",

    "text": "Wow wow wow. I was simply blown away by my dinner experience here. Service was so attentive, food was astounding. This is my 4th Michelin starred restaurant I've been to and so far it's definitely been my favourite. I can definitely say it was an eating experience rather than just a meal.I went for the Meat Fruit, which looks like a clementine with bread but is the most delicious pate. Highly recommend going for this as a starter. My main was the powdered duck, which was the most perfectly cooked duck I've ever eaten, and for my dessert I had the tipsy cake (which you have to order early on so that they can start preparing it, as it takes a while to cook) - my goodness this was possibly one of the most delicious desserts I've ever eaten. The brioche style of the cake was delicious and baked to perfection. As it was my birthday I decided to treat myself and also order the icecream which they make right in front of you. I definitely recommend going for this dessert too (you might as well splurge!) they make it right in front of you and pour the liquid nitrogen into the cream mixture so it's like a mini show. I cannot recommend this place enough. Yes you might have to save a bit before you go but if you're a foodie this is definitely one you have to try.",

Meat Fruit - Mandarin, chicken liver & foie gras parfait, grilled bread - Foie in the shape of a mandarin. \u00a0Genius. \u00a0It will convert even the most stubborn, pickiest eaters. \u00a0Those who are scared of liver - you must try this. \u00a0Our server brought out extra bread for us because we ran short! \u00a0Had to savor every last bit of that meat fruit.2. Tipsy Cake with Spit roast pineapple - Thought it would be overrated but I was wrong. \u00a0I don't mind being wrong when something tastes this good.Excellently prepared:1. Salamugundy - Chicken oysters, salsify, marrow bone & horseradish cream - Tastes like chiggen. \u00a0Simple and very satisfying. \u00a02. \u00a0Hereford Ribeye with Mushroom ketchup & fries - Can't complain about a steak done right. \u00a0And they sure do it right.3. \u00a0Spiced Pigeon with Ale & artichokes - Skeptics will be hesitant to try this. \u00a0Pigeon? \u00a0You must be crazy. \u00a0But here the skin is perfectly seasoned and crisp and the meat is juicy and full of flavor.4. \u00a0Braised lettuce & peas5. \u00a0Mashed potatoesDelicious but not as good as the dishes above:1. \u00a0Black Foot Pork Chop with Spelt, ham hock, turnip & Robert sauce2. \u00a0Cod in Cider with Chard & fired mussels3. \u00a0Mixed leaf salad (standard stuff)Not a fan:1. \u00a0Brown Bread Ice Cream with Salted butter caramel, pear & malted yeast syrup - This is the one that looks like a bumblebee (well, it looks like one to me). \u00a0This one is a pass. \u00a0Not that it's bad. \u00a0It was too bland for me.Service:Excellent. \u00a0On the border of pretentious. \u00a0But very attentive.Tips:-Make your reservation a month ahead of time if you want to eat at a normal hour.-You can also order food in the bar area in the front-Dress up",

    "text": "Go Nava, it's your birthday... we're gonna eat 9 courses like it's your birthday...Yeah, so I went to Dinner for lunch on my birthday with four friends in tow. \u00a0Thanks to Grant T.'s good bad influence, I was coerced into booking the chef's table. \u00a0Once upon a time, the Chef's table was a blanket \u00a31200 for the table with a maximum of 6 people, but now they've made it a bit more user friendly in that it's either \u00a3150 per person for lunch or \u00a3200 per person for dinner. \u00a0Oh, and a helpful hint? \u00a0The menu is exactly the same at lunch or at dinner, so why not save \u00a350?!I can't possibly say enough wonderful things about this experience. \u00a0The food was amazing. \u00a0I won't go into all the courses as Andrew and Grant have already kinda done that. \u00a0But I will say that I had lots of favorites, and not a single bad morsel was had. \u00a0My favorites were definitely the meat fruit because I'm a pate fiend, the octopus because who knew that octopus could be so tender, and the tipsy cake. \u00a0HOLY COW that tipsy cake. \u00a0And as most of my friends know, I am a cinnamon hater, so I was delighted to find out that there was no cinnamon in the tipsy cake. \u00a0Something which I think is shamefully present in most bread puddings, thus making me unable to order them.Oh, and can I dedicate a whole paragraph to the mash? \u00a0Because here it goes. \u00a0Oh. My. God. \u00a0The mash is the most amazing mash I've ever had. \u00a0I think they just gave us some to sample because Andrew was a bit disappointed about the absence of their triple-cooked chips (due to it not being the right time for potatoes. \u00a0Heston, you marvelous perfectionist). \u00a0Three bowls of mash for 5 people, and Chef Dale put a lone bowl right in front of me... I finished that. \u00a0That whole bowl went into my stomach. \u00a0I would do it again. \u00a0I would have done it again right then and there if I wasn't so full.The Chef's Table experience, outside of the food, was also fantastic. \u00a0The service was so lovely, that we just kept chatting with our main host-type-thing long after the meal was over. \u00a0Chef Dale came over to deliver dishes and explain them all to us and educated us on Cthulhu fruit. \u00a0A joke which only Grant and I get because we're giant nerds who constantly out-nerd each other.Oh, just go. \u00a0If you've got the spare cash to do the Chef's Table, do it. \u00a0Even if you don't... do it. (It went on a card. \u00a0Happy birthday to me!)",

    "text": "In my (little-used) kitchen, I have a number of menus, which I've framed, hanging on my walls. I've got menus from El Bulli and from Jiro. I've got a menu from The Fat Duck from nearly ten years ago now. I'll soon have another, from Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. My dinner was superb.Starting with a glass of NV Billecart-Salmon Brut Ros\u00e9, it took only a few moments to decide what I wanted to order. (I'd looked at the menu on line earlier.) I started with a Earl Grey Tea cured Salmon (lemon salad, gentleman's relish, wood sorrel & smoked roe) from a recipe dated c1730. The flavors were subtle. The fish was perfectly prepared and the smokiness from the roe floated above all the flavors of the dish.Moving into red wine territory, for my entree course I ordered the Black Foot Pork Chop (Hispi cabbage, lardo, ham hock & Robert sauce) prepared from an 1820 recipe. I believe this was the best pork chop I've ever eaten. I'd also ordered a side of buttered carrots with caraway. (Apparently these carrots are slow cooked in butter for hours but they maintain their structure and do not get soggy or too soft.) The unctuous fattiness of the pork with the sweetness of the carrots was off-the-charts good. For anybody ordering the Pork Chop I highly suggest you pair it with the carrots.Dessert was Brown Bread Ice Cream salted butter caramel, pear & malted yeast syrup (c. 1830). Wow. Very contemporary...salted caramel flavors are highly popular and this hits it dead on. Spectacular. At the end of my meal I was treated to a surprise. A custom made ice cream cart wheeled up and a miniature ice cream cone was prepared. The ice cream was simple...vanilla custard treated with liquid nitrogen and cranked to offer a superbly smooth concoction which was covered in some sort of apple candy crunch. The liquid nitrogen offered an understandably fun presentation with clouds forming during the cranking.Finally I'll add that the waitstaff offered the proper balance of formal and informal service. Friendly and professional. Very attentive without hovering and always easy to find. The ambiance was surprisingly contemporary which offered an interesting juxtaposition to the antiquity of the recipes.A restaurant of this size and reputation must be terribly difficult to run...especially when you have a platform like Yelp for diners to let their (often idiotic but sometimes insightful) opinions be known. Chefs are a creative bunch. There is a large waitstaff. There is a public with high demands and little commonality other than the ability to afford to eat there. I would not want to be in the shoes of the man who must run this enterprise. The GM, Paul Downie, introduced himself to me last night after letting my admittedly gushing opinion known of my dinner. We chatted for a few minutes and he gave me a short look into the working kitchen. It was Ballet M\u00e9canique as all busy, high-performing kitchens are. He is seemingly making this all work at the highest levels...and he was smiling during the height of Saturday night service. Impressive on all fronts.Most highly recommended. I will be back.",

To the list that is headed by Angus steak house should be added Dinner by Heston.It is not to say the food is bad ...

In the same way I respect Heston for producing a restaurant entirely designed for the out of towner who wants to have eaten at a Heston restaurant but really doesn't want to risk an actual fine dinning experience. Oh and this target market are going to pay for the experience!Dish wise I failed to find anything magical on the menu ... And the speed at which one can find oneself thinking \"maybe I'll have the chicken liver pate followed by a steak and frite and some ice cream to finish\" pretty much sums up the feeling of ... OMG how did I find myself in the most expensive Angus steakhouse in the world ...There are other dishes on the menu ... Did I mention the not worth ordering bit already?To be truthful there is quality to the ingredients and the cooking ... Which I am less sure about Angus steak houses ... But unless you are looking to take your out of town friends to an unchallenging/uninteresting restaurant that they can then talk to their friends about without having to experience real quality ...

Still as I got a chance to go and have lunch at a restaurant ranked 7th best in the world I did not have to think twice...I am still so overwhelmed of this experience so I don't really know where to begin my review! :DWe were a party of three and each got our own starter + one of Heston Blumenthal's signature dishes, The Meat fruit, to share. It's a chicken liver & foie gras parfait shaped as a mandarin (the orange color is made with yello). One word: WOW! This stuff, spread over toast, was so good it will make you want to slap your mother. I have never understood how something would make you slap your mama, but if something really would it would be this stuff!Everything that followed looked amazing and tasted even better. For any meat lovers out there I would really recommend the Angus stake. It was by far the most tender and best piece of meat I have ever had. And coming from someone who loves meat that says a lot... I am pretty sure Mr. Blumenthal would not be available to cook deathrow meals but I would still choose this stuff as my last meal!",

The meat fruit is AMAZING, from the presentation to the actual taste and flavour- just perfect! It is not a coincidence that every reviewer raves about this-it is a must have! The octopus was good, though I'm not a fan generally speaking, so the fact that I actually thought it was OK means it was probably great as well. For the main dish I ordered something off the menu, some beef special of the day. Wasn't great. A piece of very rare beef, you tender yes but I would have preferred a cooked flavor to it. One friend went for the Angus steak which looked good (and is served with chips) and the others went for a shared meat option which was alright. As far as dessert is concerned, don't think-just do it! The Tipsy cake is divine! I didn't expect it but it was recommended so we went for it. We also got the cheese platter-a must for any cheese lover and the piece de resistance was the nitrogen ice cream-great presentation, yummy ice cream. I'd definitely go with these recommendations for starter and dessert, be careful what to order for the main course.",

    "text": "Meat Fruit, Meat Fruit, Meat Fruit. There, now you get to read it three more times in this list of reviews. Hey, at least you won't forget, and you shouldn't. Because it really is everything you imagine it to be and more. It's just as good as everyone says, it's just as exciting to look at as to taste, and to generously spread onto your lightly toasted bread. It's silky and smooth, and delightfully savory and meaty.Unfortunately I don't remember the details of my meal since that was over two months ago. I remember a porridge of some sort, I remember the octopus appetizer which was a very innovative and successful dish. I remember having a duck breast for my entree which featured a nice, thick, perfectly roasted fatty skin.But mostly I recommend this place because despite the fact that it is a world renowned restaurant, it is shockingly simple. None of this crazy 32 course tasting menus where the plates are choreographed to hit the table all at once. None of the pomp and circumstance of many other restaurants on its level. It's simple. Order everything a la carte. Want an appetizer? Order one. Not that hungry? Ok, then just order an entree. It's a very traditional, easy-going, order and eat restaurant. And as much as we all like to be treated like royalty, sometimes you just want to order what you want without all the silly rules and restrictions that come with a pre fixe or tasting menu. \u00a0And the price! The price is shockingly reasonable for one of the world's best restaurants. You don't have to spend your lifetime savings to have a one of a kind culinary experience and Dinner by Heston is a good example of a place where you can still wine and dine yourself, but not have to starve yourself for the rest of the month to make up for it.",

    "text": "Meat fruit! Honestly, that's all I cared about for days. A friend told me about Dinner by Heston, so I immediately research this place and found a video interviewing Heston. Absolutely fascinating, especially the meat fruit. Located inside the Mandarin Hotel, we had a nice view of Hyde Park. You're immediately started with white and brown ale bread and lightly salted butter. Beware of the French waiter. He asks you if you want more bread, you ponder, he says \"why not?\" and he's right. The meat fruit was the overall winner. It's a tempting orange orb hiding delicious meatiness inside. We savored this dish and I fought my natural inclination to lick it clean. One must adhere to some professionalism while dining here.Next was the pork chop. It was finely presented, though I would have appreciated a more serious knife. It was nice, not lacking in flavor, but wasn't extraordinary. It was forgettable.Dessert featured the tipsy cake (must order first for preparation time) and brown bread ice cream. Excellent presentations for both. The brown bread ice cream was my winner as I scooped through all three layers. The tipsy cake was great too, but I had unrealistic visions of a whole spit roasted pineapple. And forgive for comparing a Heston dessert to a breakfast food, but the tipsy cake reminded me a nice french toast. So again, I enjoyed the brown bread ice cream's flavors challenging my palate.Note: if you sit with a group, be sure to read the inside of your napkin holders. Written inside are unusual facts about dining hundreds of years ago. Learn about utensil history, spices and more.",

You could say that it was a somewhat altruistic present, but by the end of the evening even he was completely and utterly won over.I on the other hand was sold from the second we walked into the hotel and proceeded to giggle with delight at the spiced duck (fresh from the sous vide machine) and Tipsy Cake. The Vegetarian had the one meat-free option on the menu, essentially posh cauliflower cheese. But you have to hand it to the chefs, to make up for the sad lack of meat or fish, they really did pull out all the stops on every element and it too was delicious. He finished up with the Chocolate Bar pudding which was stunning, but not as good as my Tipsy Cake (unlucky). We ordered a bottle of house red from the sommelier and he didn't even blink at our plebby choice of vino. My one regret was not having the Meat Fruit starter, but even I'm not mean enough to make a vegetarian pay for delicious but cruel foie gras. Shame. I should add a small disclaimer that I'd never been to a Michelin-starred restaurant before so would probably have oohed and ahhed whatever they'd served, but for me the whole thing was a massive thrill. High recommended.",

    "text": "After watching hours of Heston's Feast and theme shows about the best french fry ever, I invited my husband to Dinner for his birthday.We arrived to the beautiful Mandarine hotel and were recommended a few pre-dinner cocktails while they prepared our table. As one would expect, amazing cocktails! We had a really late reservation, so I have to admit after the second cocktail we were happy and tipsy.Once seated, I went for the meat fruit as the starter; I haven't watched hours of Heston's Feast for nothing :-) I just loved that it actually looked like a fruit, down to the peel and all. Also, I quite fancied that every dish came with a circa date for when it was invented - the meat fruit c. 1500. \u00a0For main, we had the Bone in Rib of Hereford Prime for 2 people, c. 1800, with Heston's famous French fries - the meat was really good, the fries divine - and plenty of it. But still, for me, the starter was the highlight. We were to stuffed to truly appreciate the dessert, but the combination ice cream / fruit / cake was really tasty.At the end of our meal, they brought us a choco-mousse thing in a glass with 'happy birthday' written beautifully on the side. A great way to finish off an amazing meal. It was a great night out. I'll give the food 4 and the overall experience a 5.",

We started with the meat fruit, which was like nothing I've ever had before: it had a mix really of the meaty chicken liver flavor and the mandarine orange taste. Lovely presentation. Then I had the Angus filet, which was perfectly prepared. Finally, the tipsy fruit and ice cream were a real treat! Tipsy fruit is a spit roasted pineapple served with a brioche pastry soaked in brandy. The ice cream is made on a cart before your eyes, using liquid nitrogen! I have never seen anything like it! Service was great, especially the sommeliere from HK who was very knowledgeable. Plus, the cocktail of the day served at the Mandarin Oriental bar was unique and a perfect way to start the experience! Dinner cost about \u00a3100 per person.",

I thought, \"Ok, new restaurant, availability on OpenTable, why not?\"I actually thought this place was amazing. But my expectations were so high once I realized who the chef was that I'm not sure whether this place met or exceeded them.You're welcome to read all of the different reviews where they tell you that the dishes at this restaurant were based on historic British recipes. And they'll also tell you that these are significantly sheeshed-up versions of classic recipes.We started out, as most do, with the meat fruit. This is a ball of liver wrapped up to look like a mandarin orange. As a person who always needs more vitamin B12 and has learned to love liver, this was fascinating and delicious. Quite a work of art.The rest of the dishes were both delicious and filling. This is not the sort of place where they bring you 12 tiny courses. You get three big courses. I think those who are expecting a Fat Duck experience will find something incredible but it's not a tasting menu.Gluten-free notes: They serve gluten-free bread! Even your meat-fruit will come out with gluten-free bread to spread it on.",

    "text": "I visited Dinner by Heston for lunch and had great expectations since I tried the magnificent Fat Duck in Bray.Compared to The Fat Duck where you get around 18 courses, this new restaurant by Heston Blumenthal is more for a 4-5 course dinner. The molecular gastronomy is not in focus here - it's about honest cooking at its best. Here the concept is traditional english cooking using recipes from the past 700 years. And this is done We started out with the Meat Fruit which is an amazing dish. But more bread is needed at it took almost 10 minutes to get this - not acceptable.I then had the pork chops. The taste of the meat was excellent but it was a little bit dry. The spelt, ham hock, turnip and Robert sauce was absolutely great. Perfect companions to the meat. I ordered the mash potato as a side dish and it was out of this world - probably with significant help of butter. The final dish was the Tipsy cake with the spit roast pineapple. One of the best desserts I ever had - simplex and like being in a foetal position. You feel warm and loved.The food is so great, warm and just so easy to love. It's really comfort food. But unfortunately the room was extremely noisy (probably many americans?) and a bit hectic - this is not a perfect match for this food. The food felt like heavy carpets and a fireplace, but the room was almost the opposite.The pricing was very, very fair. We payed 220 pounds for 3 courses for two persons including Champaign and a glass of white wine. Very decent.But, next time I'm in London I will be here again - if I can get a table.",

Both meats were prepared very well. \u00a0Our waiter told us the pork was prepared at low heat for 16 hours, and it shows- the pork was incredibly slippery and buttery. \u00a0The pidgeon was prepared medium, and it was amazing how easily my knife slipped right in.Desserts:\u00a312 Tipsy Cake was served with a caramelized brioche doused in a creamy sauce and grilled pineapple. \u00a0Like the \u00a310 Quaking Pudding (which has some serious wobble skills), the Tipsy Cake was good but nothing memorable.Drinks:Drinks are pricey here, running from \u00a313 to \u00a320. \u00a0They have an extensive selection with images of the types of glasses used for the drinks, but I found the drinks we ordered a bit disappointing. Saigon Sling was served in a cool O shaped glass.Service:Very friendly service. \u00a0If you sit next to the kitchen, you can watch the kitchen staff at work behind the glass window.",

    "text": "Dinner by Heston is really somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.The restaurant has a nice location right by Hyde Park in the Mandarin Oriental hotel with classic modern upscale restaurant decorations (though I must point out that their lamps on the sides of the walls look like bundt cake pans). I went with my family and we ordered a la carte. All of the starters were absolutely fantastic and far better than the mains. We had the earl grey tea cured salmon, grilled octopus, and savoury porridge. The salmon was amazing (the best part of the whole dinner!), and the octopus was grilled to perfection.The mains, however, were fairly average. We had the spiced pigeon, cod in cider, and roasted halibut with sides of mashed potatoes and green beans and shallots. The halibut was probably the best of the bunch. It came with a really refreshing parsley and eucalyptus sauce. The cod was a bit cloying and though we ordered the pigeon well done, it came out more red than we would have liked. I was a little disappointed by the few options for sides.We had the rhubarb and hibiscus and taffety tart for dessert. Both were good, but neither was extremely memorable.I loved the glass of Gruner Veltliner that I had and am extremely sad that I didn't get a picture of the label. I also love that they had my favorite moscato (La Spinetta) because I don't see it as often as I'd like to.Overall Dinner by Heston is definitely worth checking out once. I like the historical concept, but think that might have limited the mains and sides - the starters were a little more inventive and were just so much better.",

    "text": "Dinner here ranks among my top three meals of all time, but sadly it's \"across the pond\" for me. I was disappointed that when we came to London, Fat Duck was closed for renovation. But Dinner made up for it, if not better. From the minute we walked in, everything was top notch. We were seated by the window with a view of Hyde Park, our servers were friendly, and knew us by names (probably because we were staying at the hotel). Menu was very interesting, the number after each item represents the year of the original recipe that chef got his inspiration from. Because they only offer tasting menu for Chef's table, which I believe is for 4 people only, we had to choose among all the yummy options on the menu. We had the meat fruit, seafood porridge, duck breast, and beef royale, which was actually part of the tasting menu, hence not part of the normal menu and they only offer limited quantities to the dinning room. Meat fruit lived up to the hype, and just when I was wondering how I was supposed to finish it with my one last bite of bread, they brought another piece of freshly toasted bread to the table. Talking about service! My duck breast was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly complimented by the jus and duck heart. My husband's beef royale, per him, is the best piece of beef he's ever had. Based on the look, the meat looked tough, but it melted in your mouth and exploded with flavors. Ashley Palmer-Watts is a genius.For dessert, of course we both got the tipsy cake. The tipsy cake itself was already good enough and balanced by the pineapple. But our lovely server recommended this dessert wine that brought out the sweetness of the cake even more. PLEASE ask for dessert wine recommendation to go with the tipsy cake, because I don't remember what we had. I promise you won't regret it.I really need to make an annual plan to return here, my wallet may hate me, but my stomach will thank me.",

Let it be said: the Meat fruit is fantastic. I order you to order this! But don't for a minute think that this tv-infused Heston-ish feel will go through the meal. Its not all disguised food and fun weird dishes, its not molecular gastronomy. It's reinvented british dishes - and well prepared no doubt about that. But I missed the WOW effect after the meat fruit. It's actually hard not to expect bells and whistles with all the Heston we've seen on tv, and with the meat fruit on the table. Yes the food is Michelin class, and the surroundings are worthy of a king. But the service is a bit stiff and I'm not sure they approve of kids (and mine are well behaved in restaurants!). So if I should go again it would be a 'no kids-all night' kind of thing!",

I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a wonderful experience.",

And I'll even tell you what to order ;) meat fruit and the Salmagundy for appetizers, the rib eye for dinner and the tipsy cake for dessert. They were amazing!!! The meat fruit is a soft and non-pungent pate of duck liver covered by this magical orange shell that disintegrates in your mouth. The Salmagundy is chicken oysters prepared in a brilliant way. Service was impeccable. I had to crack a few jokes with the waiters and they responded ;)Make a reservation way ahead. It's worth it. Oh, and we got a bottle of red wine all for appx US$226",

    "text": "This was an outstanding meal-- one of the best experiences I've had. I wanted to try everything but eventually narrowed it down to 4 things (3 things would have easily left me full, 4 left me stuffed):- Meat fruit-- this is basically a must-get. \u00a0Others have described its merits. I agree.- Salamagundy- delicious, interesting, inventive, unique, beautifully presented. There was panko crusted bone marrow, which was novel, interesting, and delicious, in addition to carmelized and perfectly cooked chicken oysters (my favorite part of the bird!)- Cod in cider- delicious, perfectly cooked, tender, flaky, rich, and buttery. The roasted artichokes and onions were particularly tasty.- Tipsy cake- another must-get. Delicious, soaked in a buttery sauce with just the perfect spike of alcohol.The prices of the cocktails were a bit high for my American dollars (\u00a317-18 each), especially since that's the same price as the meat fruit and other starters. \u00a0I stuck with wine which started around \u00a312-13/glass, and beers were in the \u00a37-8 if you were interested in starting the night with something less expensive.The food AND service here are well-deserving of its accolades as one of the best restaurants in the world, and the prices are well worth the food and experience. I was in town for business, so I dined on my own, and the service was spectacular. \u00a0The people taking care of me struck the perfect balance of chatting with me and socializing, and leaving me to enjoy my food. \u00a0Unequivocally recommended.",

    "text": "In the case of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, 5 stars is not enough. My family and I came here for my birthday dinner and it was by far one of the best meals that I have ever had.The atmosphere of the restaurant is ever so slightly corporate, but also inviting and modern. As many other reviewers have mentioned, and as you may have noticed from a perusal of the menu, Heston's is far from normal. The restaurant takes dishes that were once very popular (think 14th-19th c.) and repurposes them into plates for the modern palate. The names of the menu items are simple and give a hint to what the dish will be like. For dinner we got:Appetizers: Meat Fruit, Rice and Flesh, Roast MarrowEntr\u00e9es: Roast Iberico Pork Chop, Powdered Duck Breast, Hereford Ribeye, Chicken cooked with LettucesDessert: Tipsy Cake, Sambocade, Taffety TartPost: Earl Grey Chocolate Mousse (mine had 'Happy Birthday' written on it, nice touch)All of the dishes were amazing and each person thought that his/her own dish was the best. Following that logic, my favorites were the Rice and Flesh (probably my favorite of the night), the Pork Chop, and the Tipsy Cake. The Meat Fruit was also very good. A little confusing at first, but the flavors and textures played well together. Also, the Tipsy Cake deserves its own special mention for being delectable.Bottom-line: You will most certainly not be disappointed when you dine at Heston's. The food is unforgettable and innovative in the best way possible and the service is top notch. You will regret not making a trip here.",

The balance between chicken liver and some clementine was great. When I finished my bread, more bread was given. The waiter and waitress were paying attention at me all the time. I had celery for the main. It had multiple layers of flavor. It has hardness in walnuts but also softness in celeries and the sauce. I definitely loved it. I ordered it because I wanted something light but I was super impressed by its flavor. For the dessert, I had the tipsy cake and it was an omg experience. It was a little too sweet for me, but I enjoyed the sweetness. The pineapple was roasted right on. After dinner I was shown around the kitchen. Everyone seemed busy and focused on their job!",

This place had been on my bucket list for the better part of twelve minutes and... what, we know I'm spoiled and I get what I want when I want it, which is NOW, ok? Anyway, so. With my family in town we decided to get reservations for the lot of us and go sample Heston's genius at the Mandarin, and wanted - and I mean CRAVED- being impressed from the get go. To put my review into context, here's a nugget: to date, I've been to close to 40 Michelin starred restaurants globally, and some incredible ones in London. When you go to a 2-star, you expect lottery winning in your mouth. You expect to see sounds, to speak tongues, to feel your insides deliciously twist in that high-school-prom-night-crush way... And this wasn't it. It was good food, mind you. We were 7, so we tried EVERYTHING. The meat fruit was literally just pate in the shape of a tangerine. The frumenty was slightly underwhelming... however, the Savoury Porridge was OUT OF THIS WORLD delish. The duck was cooked to perfection, and it was tender and moist and crisp... but just a duck. The Ribeye was great, but again... just a steak. The pigeon was really delish. As for desserts... all above average ( we had EVERY single one except for the ice cream in the cart) but the Tipsy Cake was INSANE, like unreal. Literally the best thing to ever fall in my mouth ever like EVER. So all in all... I wouldnt go back honestly, it's really expensive and kind of underwhelming for what it is. I much preferred Gordon's Maze for a 2 star...",

MEAT FRUIT: friends, abandon any and all misgivings you have about liver or foie gras at the doors of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel!!! The Meat Fruit (chicken liver and foie gras parfait made to look like a mandarin orange) is a singular, most perfect dish I've ever seen or tasted in my life! The texture inside is so velvety and so decadent. SO DELICIOUS. I still dream about this dish. You MUST order this. Hell, order multiple. 2. TIPSY CAKE w/ spit-roasted pineapple: You have to order this dessert well in advanced. Why? Because perfection takes time! I don't normally love alcohol-infused desserts but this one takes the cake (ha I'm so punny...). The warm creamy brioche...oh so scrumptious. Forget calories. Order without reservations and then go jog in Hyde Park afterwards. Well worth it! Verdict: I'll come to Dinner for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner. Alas, I'm poor :(",

    "text": "Dinner by Heston Blumenthal:Knowing of the infamous Heston Blumenthal and his edible wizardry, I desired to sample his cuisine while traveling to London. Originally, I desired to dine at The Fat Duck, but sadly, I learned that it was not due to return to Bray until the end of September 2015; we visited the UK a few weeks too soon! In any event, we decided that dining at Dinner by Heston should satisfy out gastronomic cravings. We dined in September 2015. Our experience was tepid overall. \u00a0We enjoyed the food, yet we felt that aside from the iconic classics- Meat Fruit and Tipsy Cake- the food was not extraordinary. \u00a0The service was also patchy and unexpected. We were abandoned throughout our meal and felt like an afterthought. While we dined at 9:45pm, the time of night should be irrelevant; the staff should be as attentive at 10:00pm as they are at six in the evening. \u00a0Our water glasses were filled once initially and then never again, remaining empty throughout the meal. Upon ordering dessert, the waiter informed us that they had run out of certain options-- absolutely unacceptable for a Two Michelin Star establishment. I had such high hopes for Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, but I'm left with a sense of disappointment. See below for a more complete review. Reservations:We had a full day of activities planned in London, so I imagined 9:45 in the evening would work well with our schedule. Upon arrival, we were kept waiting and were not seated until 10:00pm. The restaurant appeared rather empty, and the wait staff seemed exhausted. D\u00e9cor:The restaurant itself is inside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. The dining room was large and open with high ceilings. The kitchen was adjacent and with near floor-to-ceiling, you could peer into the kitchen, although it was rather quiet at that time of night. Libations:We ordered a glass of unremarkable red wine to sip throughout our dinner. Bread:The rustic sourdough bread with English farmhouse butter was average. I wish they had a bread trolley or a more extensive selection. Appetizers:The 16th Century Meat Fruit was the most exquisite dish of the evening. It is Blumenthal's signature dish here, and it exceeded expectations. The foie gras was velvety and unlike any I've ever had. The staff did replace the accompanying bread- one of their only attentive acts of the evening. The late 14th Century Frumenty octopus had a nice flavor and was enjoyed. We also tried the 18th Century Salamagundy chicken oysters, and we found them to be excessively fried and salty. Entr\u00e9es: The late 17th Century Powdered Duck Breast was cooked to perfection- still quite rare and tender. The accompanying fennel and spiced beetroot were also a nice touch. The duck was draped in a rather thick, chewy layer of fat, which was a bit much for me. Furthermore, dare I say that the portion was too large; this should have been an appetizer, as halfway through, I was longing for some new favors. The early 19 Century Roast Iberico Pork Chop was too well-done and very dry. Neither entr\u00e9e was stunning, but the duck was the better of the two. Dessert:My disappointment culminated when attempting to order dessert. Our server informed us that they simply \"ran out\" of their new, popular dessert, Beekeeper's Chocolate. An esteemed two Michelin star establishment should never \"run out\" of something, let alone a popular dish. The disappointment was further compounded when I was told that there is a minimum order or two when requesting the infamous nitro ice cream; unacceptable once again in my eyes. The server should have made an exception, especially as he was unable to provide my first selection of the Beekeeper's! My dining companions only wanted to share my dessert selection, so we all nibbled on the famed Tipsy Cake. This dessert was truly exceptional. The hype is true, and this dessert must be ordered.  Service:As a well-versed gourmand, the service we received was not even of a one Michelin star establishment. Our water glasses remained empty throughout our entire meal, never once being checked on. We felt abandoned and a bother to the staff, whom appeared more than eager to retire to their flats for the evening. Summary:Heston Blumenthal's iconic dishes certainly deserved high accolades. The Meat Fruit and Tipsy Cake were extraordinary. The device left a lot to be desired, and I am left puzzled, since this establishment has been ranked among the top ten for several years, according to San Pellegrino World's Best. My Recommendation:Go. Heston Blumenthal's iconic dishes alone would draw me back in. \u00a0I hope that my rather cold experience with the staff was uncharacteristic and a fluke, which should never happen for an establishment to this caliber. If I have the opportunity again in the future, I will return. 2 starsMichelin Stars: Two (2016)San Pellegrino World's Best: #7 (2015)",

    "text": "Had dinner at Dinner. Great location in the heart of Knightsbridge inside the Mandarin Oriental with a Michelin star by Heston Blumenthal so there are some expectations it had to live up to.Unfortunately it was overhyped. The inside is very modern and service is indeed spectacular. However, all of the dishes we ordered (we ordered a variety on the menu) was good but not special. I was really disappointed as the flavour didn't really have a 'pop'. \u00a0We could have been eating at our local gastropub. \u00a0The only dish which had a unique taste was the pineapple dessert. \u00a0Even the ice cream which was made in front of you with dry ice was all show and no go - nothing unique about it.Their cocktails were good as well - but again, nothing too spectacular given the other options at the cocktail bars around London. Unfortunately I won't be coming here again.",

I had the tasting menu which seemed like a steal at 32 or so British pounds because, let's be honest, with a full week in London in store my dollars wouldn't cover the a-la-carte ordering. I had a salad with beetroot puree, goat curds, etc which was delish! The salmon for the main course that was cured in bergamot was probably the best salmon I've ever had--and I've had quite a lot. The dessert, however, was a bit disappointing. It was a prune and date tart, on which I would venture they overcooked the crust. But the little amuse bouche they gave at the end made up for it--bergamot flavored chocolate ganache w/a caraway cracker of sorts. Couple all that with a couple glasses of wine, finish off the meal w/an espresso and I was a happy lady. Highly recommended! I should have ordered the pineapple dessert a-la-carte though (some kind of sticky cake w/it), as the French women sitting at the next table were making crazy sounds while eating it.",

Private room was lovely, overlooks the main dining area but is away from the hussle and bustle (also main restaurant was v. noisy). We were well looked after with attentive service. Started with scallops (disappointing, small and taste-less); followed by Meat-Fruit which was stunning - both in looks and taste. Shaped like a small mandarin orange it was actually filled with a delicious chicken liver pate. Followed by Turbot which was so so, then onto the famous Tipsey Cake with spit roast pineapple. Again I found this disappointing - like a runny bread & butter pudding with dull warm pineapple on the side. My friends tried the Chocolate Bar which I thought was more sucessful - dark and multi-layered.Most of the other guests were completely wowed by the food so I think it must only have been me who was under-whelmed.

I suppose the concept (which I have a great deal of respect for) didn't draw me in- each dish had a 'title' and a year... but there was clearly so much more to those dishes as 'signs of the times'.... & taste alone couldn't convey. Lost in translation, I suppose, but I wanted more way-points. A solid amuse bouche & a brief conceptual orientation from the (excellent) server would have set things up nicely I expect. One also has to set the table also for a conversation, if that's what one is wanting to have, but in my impression- despite the ordination- it wasn't.",

    "text": "[Non-Photo Review] For full review, please click here: wp.me/pwXBH-1ag \u00a0IT'S TECHNICALLY DELICIOUS Summary:Heston Blumenthal's first London restaurant has set the UK's food media into a frenzy. And with some good reason \u00a0the food is pretty good. In a similar vein to the Fat Duck, there is a lot of work that goes into the creation of each dish \u00a0both intellectually and in terms of the technical skill required to consistently replicate each deceivingly simple dish on a much grander scale than any of his Bray outposts. The kitchen generally pulls it off, and the service seemed to be pretty spot-on when we dined there (though we were at the chef's table, so you would expect nothing less). Don't come expecting the dramatic culinary theatre that Heston is famous for at the Fat Duck \u00a0and on many of his TV programs \u00a0as the dishes here are far more straightforward in their presentation, with a few exceptions. With a windowful view of Hyde Park \u00a0thanks to the newly installed floor-to-ceiling windows \u00a0and its very own Swiss watchmaker-fashioned rotating gas-fired rotisserie for pineapples, it's definitely worth trying when in London. Much ado about something The only way I could actually score a table at what was then being billed by most as the hottest restaurant opening in London in a long time, and by some as the best new restaurant in the world (which was probably taking things a little too far), was to book the chef's table. When I enquired, I found out that there is technically no fee for booking the table, but there is a minimum spend of \u00a3900, which can be split amongst up to six guestsso definitely the more the merrier. The \u00a3150/person price, in the case of six, pays for the tasting menu, which enables you to sample much of the \u00e0 la carte menu. Drinks and service will cost extra. One small point, which relates smaller people. We wanted to bring our daughter with us (who at the time was nine months old), and although this seemed to present a problem at first, the issue was eventually resolved (indeed, there had been no issue in the first place but we seemingly had been misinformed the first time around), though not without some time and effort. In any case, I will assume for the benefit of most readers that you know who Heston Blumenthal is (if not, see my previous review of his Michelin 3-star restaurant in Bray), and that you know that 'Dinner' is his first restaurant in London. You can read about the word play \u00a0a typical example of Heston's historical whimsy \u00a0on the restaurant's website or in many of the other reviews out there. Apparently, the Mandarin Oriental, in which the restaurant is housed, insisted that they use his name on the masthead, even though he personally will not be the chef at the restaurant \u00a0a fact he has been refreshingly transparent about from the beginning. Heston's right-hand man, Ashley Palmer-Watts is in charge of quite literally a small army of chefs (there are more than 40) and kitchen staff, most of whom remain cleverly shielded from the restaurant's customers, who are likely none the wiser. There are 126 covers at Dinner, which makes it by far the largest of Heston's restaurants \u00a0the Fat Duck only has about 40 covers by comparison, and his two pubs in Bray (the Hinds Head and The Crown) are also far smaller. The part of the kitchen that is visible to diners is open, though mostly covered by a sheet of glass that comes down from the ceiling. There are two large islands in the kitchen, which were custom-made by Rorgue, that utilize multi-point induction hobs. As many readers will already know, Heston is well-known for using the sous-vide (or 'water bath') method for cooking many of the proteins in his dishes, and there are correspondingly seven large built-in water baths in the main kitchen itself. There is also a Josper oven, which can reach temperatures of over 930\u00b0 F, which is used for the beef dishes. In addition to all of this, there is a pastry kitchen, which is more or less hidden behind the chef's table, and there are more prep kitchens located out of site in the bowels of the hotel. The design of the restaurant is pleasant enough, without demanding your attention. But once you begin to look around, you do notice that in true Heston style, no detail in this Adam Tihany designed room has been left unconsidered. The space is very open, with high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows that were newly installed with the changing of the restaurant's guard. Brown and gray hues dominate the lower reaches, with wood flooring, unadorned wooden tables, and classy cushioned banquettes. Then there are the oft-noted jelly mold (or possibly cake mold) lamps and the Swiss watchmaker Ebel-designed chrome and steel pulley-operated rotating gas fire rotisseriefor what else but pineapples. The front of house is also smartly attired in well-tailored suits and waistcoats. Being at the chef's table, we had the benefit of each course being presented by the head chef himself. The table",

The dishes came out and sat on a table next to us while we waited for the \"waiter\" to come past to place it in front of us! The food was BELOW average. The wines by the glass left alot to be desired. The famous chicken liver mousse \"meat fruit\" starter was bland to say the least. My partners \"rice and flesh\" was even worse. The rice being undercooked, and having waited so long to be served, had developed a film on top! The main of beef for two was so fatty and underwhelming that we did not finish it. This is saying alot considering my partner is a self confessed beef addict! To add insult to injury, the portion of mushroom ketchup was tiny.The sides of triple cooked fries and black cabbage were far too salty. The mixed leaf salad beyond boring.Trying to cheer ourselves up we looked forward to the dessert. Having read the reviews, \"tipsy cake\" was a no brainer. Wish i hadnt bothered!A brioche in a syrup with a tiny sliver of grilled pineapple on the side. What is the fuss about?!All in all, our meal here was a diabolical dissapointment. Reminded us of how we felt when we left the Fat Duck a few years ago! No more Heston for us thats for sure!",

    "text": "This might go down among the best meals we have had in London lately, as well as among the best meals of this vacation. The cooking was flawless, the service impeccable and the ambience befitting a Michelin star restaurant.Our first course included the much talked about Meat Fruit. Interestingly enough this was the only dish we had that qualifies as molecular gastronomy. The foie gras parfait was moulded into a shell made of mandarin orange gele\u00e9. Truth be told, I enjoy a seared slice of foie gras with a fruit compote accompaniment. To me, the searing adds a textural dimension that makes it a touch better. This was probably the least successful dish from a taste standpoint, whereas the presentation was really dramatic.The other appetizer, Nettle porridge with Frog legs was perfectly executed, unique and flavorful - characteristics it shared with all of the other dishes we sampled. This was the first time I had savory oats and they did not disappoint. The nettles were subtle. In combination with the heirloom jewel beets, garlic and fennel, they presented interesting and novel flavors.Our main dishes were the cod in cider with chard and mussels, and the powdered duck breast with fennel and umbles. I haven't the foggiest idea what part of the duck was powdered. I had to look up \"umbles\" to write this review (I found out that it means organ meats). Regardless, both mains were delicious. Perfectly executed with precisely balanced flavors. In fact, if it weren't for the chef's reputation as a mad scientist, I would have called this a great example of fine cooking.We had the Tipsy cake with spit roasted pineapple for dessert. No complaints, but nothing to sit up and take notice either. The br\u00fbl\u00e9ed pineapple was a nice touch.We asked the sommelier to pair wines with each of the dishes. He was extremely helpful, quite knowledgeable and did a fine job. We sampled a Ruinart NV champagne, white & red Burgundies and a Jurancon sweet wine with foie gras which was new to me - much like a Sauternes with a lighter, fresher profile.All in all, we think it is well worth a visit!",

The restraunt was modern and spacious but \u00a0filled \u00a0up pretty quickly. I was impressed by the off. The menu was very detailed in the heratige of each dish and the waiter was able to elaborate even more, adding personal recommendations. Whilst it didn't change our choices, was good to know he'd actually eaten the food. The smelliers recommendation was beautiful and we were not let down in the slightest. The snails in marrow bone with pickled veggies was a triumph to start. The belly pork with air light puffs of cracking the tipsy pudding and roasted pineaple still stick in my thoughts 8 months on. The extra attention to detail was incredible. The website mentions that lunch time dinners have an hour and a half \u00a0slot but 3 hours flew by as we received complimentary desserts for both my birthday and for both of us for our engagement. I was sat where i could see into the kitchen which was great fun and we were shown around the kitchens and met the chef as well. We were made to feel very welcome and despite the very full restaurant given every care and attention. A wonderful experience and just makes me even more determined to finally get a table at the fat duck!",

    "text": "Sharky's Best New RestaurantsBY SHARKING FOR CHIPS AND DRINKS The restaurant industry is a fickle beast and survival isn't always easy. Places come and go, concepts change, chefs depart - \u00a0but the very best in the business demonstrate they are on the money from day one. These places opened their doors to the public in the last 18 months and clearly have staying power. We have no doubt they will leave an indelible mark on their respective dining landscapes over the coming years.This was one of the first meals we had in 2012 while visiting friends and family in London. Phoning up three months in advance for a weekday lunch, we managed to secure a table and somehow bypass the five-month waiting list. Housed in the glorious surrounds of the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, Dinner's tables are some of the most coveted in the world. It probably has something to do with Heston's mega-popularity, and the fact that diners can hang out in one of the city's best hotels for a few hours. There are two menus available at lunch - both consisting of dishes that have been inspired by recipes from between 1500-1700 - a la carte and a three-course set menu for only $40. This establishes it as one of the greatest bargains of the year - excellent service, views over the park, a glimpse into the mechanics of the cavernous kitchen (which includes rows of spit-roasted pineapples) and great wine by the bottle from $30, you can't go wrong.",

    "text": "In 2010, news of a London opening by Heston was greeted with enthusiasm and plenty waited with bated breath for the actual date. The date was finally announced for 31st January and there was a flurry of emails and tweets during the week before reservation lines opened. You'll have to be hibernating under a rock not to notice what was happening. Barely a few minutes into the day reservations opened and all I could see was a steady stream of tweets with people announcing their successful reservations and echoes of others bemoaning if the system crashed. At 11.30am was when I finally decided to send an email to friends to see if anyone was interested. To my surprise, there was quick action from an otherwise usually laid back group my friends are and in a blink of an eye, I found myself with a lunch booking. On a rainy Sunday afternoon, I found myself walking up the stairs of the Mandarin Oriental and into Dinner by Heston. I have to say that it's not exactly visible as there were no prominent signs and not surprising to see some lost souls wandering around. The first thing we tried was the meat fruit. his has been raved and described about by so many that it could stretch as long as to the moon and back. It certainly deserves all the accolades and gushes of compliments. The most beautiful light creamy texture possible, I have never had chicken liver parfait tasted this mind blowingly good. Being served with the aesthetic of a mandarin could only add to its uniqueness.",

We also had to get the room which is 1500 pound minimum because we had too many people.They started us with risotto, calf tail in red wine and saffron. The risotto was too raw for me. I don't like it when I can crunch down on them. It was pretty creamy and you can taste the butter in it.The next was the meat fruit, which I will give him prop in making it so beautiful. This mandarin looking thing was filled with chicken liver. It's not very flavorful or anything, but the toast was pretty good with it. It comes with way too much liver... I only ate about 1/3 before I started feeling a little sick.For my main course, I chose the Roast Turbot, which is a fish. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented it very well. The pigeon was also pretty good, very juicy and tender. Wish I could've gotten more of this in stead of the meat fruit.The tipsy cake was absolutely delicious. Way better than the chocolate bar I chose. The bread was super fluffy and buttery and sweet. I should've just bought some wimbledon final tickets instead of coming here.",

    "text": "Went here last week for lunch.The food, service and atmosphere were excellent.This is an expensive restaurant, so no surprises there. The restaurant's design and furnishings are all fine - as is the panoramic view over Hyde Park - but that's not really the main attraction so let's not dwell on them (yes, there's some flashy clock mechanism, giant jelly moulds for lampshades on the walls and the kitchen's on open view - so you can see the pineapples on the spit roast) - it's the food that matters. The portions are very large. I shared a starter and we opted for the almost famous \"meat fruit\". Highly recommended if you like foie gras and chicken liver parfait with a delicate mandarin jelly, shaped like the namesake of the hotel where Dinner is located; a fantastically memorable dish. On the waiter's recommendation we opted for the \u00a372 between 2 people Wing of aged Aberdeen Angus Black. It was deliciously tender and meaningfully meaty but didn't look as impressive as we'd expected it to be, because the waiter had described it as a centrepiece. The wing arrived slightly underdone (more rare than medium rare) and a replacement arrived with an absolute minimum of fuss and delay. Accompanying the wing were a mushroom ketchup and berry jus - both delicious - with a cup of triple-fried chips on the side. We couldn't finish our main due to a meat induced near coma. There's room for improvement - the facilities were not nearby (guess a short walk is the price we pay for a restaurant based on some of the world's most valuable real-estate) - would have liked to deduct half a star from this review because with a restaurant of Dinner's calibre I'd have expected an amuse bouche; the bread and butter were excellent quality though and to deduct a whole star would be churlish. At the end of the meal we were offered a sort of post amuse bouche of a small cup of white chocolate creme with an almond biscuit - whilst not bad, it didn't rock my world in any way. With our meal we enjoyed two excellent non alcoholic cocktails - my friend went for a Green Goblin and I had a .....something or other sunrise - both well were made drinks that lasted. Looking forward to a return visit, in which case I'll be sorely tempted to just have a couple of starters - one of which will have to be the roasted marrowbone with anchovies. Dinner is in many ways a very different experience to the Fat Duck, yet it retains Heston Blumenthal's imprint - despite his comments in interview that it's really Ashley Palmer-Watts' restaurant with Blumenthal's name on the door - whilst not overtly displaying molecular gastronomy, there's definitely some heavyweight detail going on in the cooking; the menu's historic recipes span several centuries and it's Heston Blumenthal's clear passion for gastro historical-reenactment with a twist, that define's the food.",

    "text": "I am really, really proud to be the 3rd person to review Dinner. I had put all thoughts of getting a table for the next 6 months completely out of my mind as nigh on impossible, and so was flabbergastered when my brother announced that he'd managed to secure a table for lunch. I was practically hyperventilating with excitement - which was only exacerbated when I noticed who was sitting in middle of the room - only Heston Blooming Blumenthal himself. Reader, I am not normally a star struck person, but suddenly I was in love and could barely standing up. The room is vast and has a wonderful view of Hyde Park, but couldn't really escape the feeling of being part of a hotel. I remember reading that it is formed out of part of the old breakfast rooms, and I did feel like I should be expecting a waiter to take my tea or coffee orders at any point...albeit posh ones. Nonetheless - this was the place I'd been reading - and drooling - about as the reviews starting pouring in, and so the excitement flooded back as we were led to our table and I began to notice all the details the reviewers had pointed out: THERE WERE THE PINEAPPLES! THERE WERE THE JELLY MOULD LIGHTS! My brother (despite being in the restaurant industry, I might add) didn't seem to know that much about the menu, so I quickly launched into an explanation of what he should have and what we had to order. I should now point out that I don't eat red meat. This meant that I forced him to have the Meat Fruit \"because we have to\" despite the fact that I wouldn't actually try it - although the fact that his face lit up as soon as he tasted it assured me that I'd steered him in the right direction. I started with the scallops with cucumber ketchup, which we both agreed was rather disappointing - yes, the scallops were good, but there are only so many bits of roasted cucumber you can eat without getting bored, and I would have taken regular ketchup over the cucumber variety every time. My brother had some concoction of steak and bone marrow next, which he said was very good, but was hard pressed to say that it was the Best Steak He'd Ever Eaten - with good quality ingredients, which of course these were, it's hard to get anything too wrong with a steak. My Cod In Cider, which came with a mussel broth, was far superior, and conversely I could say that it was possibly The Best Fish I'd Ever Eaten. I think the waiter said they poach it in oil before pan frying it, and it was positively sumptuous. We'd pre-ordered the famed Tipsy Cake, and also had the Brown Bread Ice-Cream, which we were warned would be \"slightly more savoury than most people would think.\" I can honestly say I didn't get the big deal with the Tipsy Cake - the brioche was nice and yes, roasted pineapple is novel (although tasted half like fresh and half like dried pineapple), but it didn't really blow me away. The Brown Bread ice cream was better, but I felt this was certainly the weakest course in the meal. A post-dessert of white chocolate and earl grey ganache was far superior - a quirky combo that really worked, and a lovely way to finish off the meal. So why the four stars? Partly to be controversial - everyone and his dog seems to be giving Dinner 5 stars, to the point of which I think they were preparing to do so even before the restaurant had opened. But also because, in all honesty, not every dish was a hit. It was a fantastic experience, and one I will never forget, but I wasn't left dreaming of dishes or desperate to go back, suggesting that perhaps it wasn't quite the Perfection Heston was in search of.",

    "text": "Some time ago, I spent a good half an hour or so discussing Tudor banquets at Hampton Court and, despite the risk of turning into a latter-era Henry VIII, vowed someday I'd try and experience this feast. Even if it meant spending the next month living at the gym in apology to my arteries. Dinner by Heston Blumenthal isn't quite this Tudor feast, but it'll do as the nearest thing available until time travel's invented. Even the setting overlooking Hyde Park makes you forget that you're in a hotel and instead conjures up the image of the royal party galloping back through the park to the finest food of their era. And Henry would probably approve of Heston's olde England-inspired menu. For those who've missed the hype (in which case, where have you been?), this is not the Fat Duck does London, this is a very different beast indeed. Dinner, overseen by Heston and led by Ashley Palmer-Watts, could be seen as an extension of the chef's Channel 4 Feasts series, as he delves back into England's culinary heritage for inspiration. And, as the name of the restaurant itself would imply, there's more of a hint of playfulness running throughout a menu full of bold, powerful flavours. Let's stop for a minute right here and warn you what to expect. Dinner is not cheap, unless you go for the excellent value Monday to Friday \u00a328 lunch deal. We missed the Monday to Friday aspect of this, realised we were going to have to go full-whack, shrugged, and decided what the hell. Our credit cards didn't thank us, but our bellies certainly did. For starters, their was no question that we weren't going to try the curiously-titled Meat Fruit. Arriving like a tangerine with grilled bread, this was a dish that teased and dared you to go inside. The mandarin covering was like a light jelly that complement the rich chicken liver parfait perfectly. Rich, yes, but lighter than you'd expect. Equally good was the broth of lamb, with sweetbreads, assorted vegetables and a perfectly slow-cooked hen's egg floating in the middle. Such was the aroma, I almost inhaled this. The broth had such a depth of flavour that it threatened to overwhelm the other flavours, but just stayed on the right side of tying the dish together, with the sweetbreads in particular delicious. For mains, it was onto the powdered duck with smoked fennel and potato puree and, on the recommendation of one of the many excellent staff attending to us, and spiced pigeon with artichoke hearts and ale sauce. Neither animal should have the right to be this obscenely tender. You could leave the pigeon on your tongue and it would melt straight through, while the duck (powdered lightly with spices, not talcum powder, although the latter wouldn't surprised you with Heston) was slow-cooked to perfection, with a layer of fat around pink meat. The texture was almost more akin to lamb, the taste was definitely duck. One small criticism was the fennel had been smoked a little too long, but this is a minor quibble. All this, though, was merely softening our stomachs up for the final assault: dessert. At this stage, the kitchen seriously stepped the action up a gear, in case we hadn't expanded enough. Brown bread ice cream with a salted caramel sauce was refreshing and devoured with relish. The chocolate bar with ginger ice cream was thick, rich and played with your tastebuds, yet didn't weigh your stomach down. Dinner could market these as a snack for those in need of a comfort snack on the sofa and would make a killing. And finally came the unexpected highlight - a petite four of Earl Grey ganache with caraway seed biscuit. This was thick and creamy with the tea flavour dominating but not overwhelming. As my friend said, if it wasn't inappropriate, she would have licked the cup dry. You could make a few minor criticisms if you were looking for absolute perfection. The presentation was occasionally a little less than you'd expect and, while the meal was excellent throughout, it would perhaps be too much to describe as absolutely mind-blowing. And, on a personal level, I shed a small tear inside when I learnt the 72-hour slow-cooked beef wasn't available for our sitting. But this is casting around for faults for the sake of it and, as Dinner gets into its stride, it would be no shock to see these ironed out completely. And given the amount of happy noises coming from both of us during the meal and the sheer joy, depth and fun throughout the two hours we were seated, perhaps even a tad ungracious. It was good, let's leave it at that. For the special, if limited, lunch menu and the unexpectedly reasonable wine by the glass (but definitely not the bottle), this is actually an absolute bargain of high-end cooking at prices that won't break the bank. But, to hell with it, go ahead, splash out and enjoy, because I've not had many better meals. The only danger is that such is the richness of the courses that I may now be in danger of contracting gout. In",

    "text": "For those of you who have spent the last year only eating in MacDonalds, or who don't care a fig for fine dining, bald headed culinary Wonka Heston Blumenthal (he of the snail porridge and 'food as theatre' TV programmes) has just opened a new restaurant called Dinner on the most expensive street corner in Western Europe. Restaurateurs. Don't. Get. Any. More. Exciting. Than. Him.The room is fairly generic opulent hotel resto chic. Neutral beige palate, expensive fixtures and a proliferation of arseholes in suits. It is the dining room of the Mandarin Oriental, one of London's most expensive hotels, after all. That being said, there are moments of zany Heston-ism scattered around; jelly moulds act as light fittings, the back bar is lit with gummi coloured bottles of booze and serried ranks of pineapples roast on a spit powered by the largest Swiss watch you'll ever see (I'll come back to those...).It ain't another Fat Duck. Neither is it just a posh food pit for fat cats to roll around in. It's somewhere between the two, but mostly just a five star hotel restaurant. It's less complex than you'd expect. There's no nine course set tasting menu here (no tasting menu at all, unless you're in the Chef's Table overlooking the pass), just three simple courses, each with 8 or 10 options. Recipes aren't beset with foams and gels and carnival flourish, but are taken from the annals of British food history, the grand dishes served to our forefathers (or at least the forefathers belonging to the monied arseholes in suits).As you'd expect, the prices are challenging in places, challenging to those not on expense account dining certainly. While there are a number of wines in the 28 page list below \u00a3100, the vast bulk of the list is pitched above this point (some considerably so), that being said, we found a very pleasant Fleurie at \u00a345. More surprising is a three course lunch set menu at a very reasonable \u00a328. I go for this while my guest plumps for the a la carte option. I've seen one too many reviews not to have heard of the Meat Fruit, a chicken liver parfait coated in mandarin gel, shaped and textured like a little mandarin. We add one of those to the table too, with the current waiting list at 6 months it's going to be a while before I'm back to try it again. My Ragoo of Pigs Ears is a real star. It's been braised for hours with sweet onion and parsley and the cartilage is sweet and soft, an intensely concentrated meaty kick. Dr Science goes for the Salamagundy, a perfectly constructed and flavoursome hot salad of chicken oysters, bone marrow and a light horseradish cream. If anything it's a little soft and texturally lacking, but that's not much to lay against it. And the Meat Fruit? It's a ball of chicken liver parfait. Strangely tasteless without the char of the sourdough. I don't think I saw a single table go without one though. The Roast Quail from the set menu was another flavour triumph for my cheaper menu choice. The turnips served with it were subtly smoked and then roasted, just the sort of thing you hope for from Heston. Soft game breast worked well barely cooked, though the just cooked meat was remarkably difficult to separate from the tiny quail legs. The 72 hour slow roast rib of angus beef managed to arouse high passion on arrival, a thick lozenge of dark meat, served with a thick jus, cubes of ox tongue and baby veg. It was good, but certainly not brilliant. The meat had the texture of a hunk of salt beef, and was relatively one dimensional in its flavour. Definitely one that didn't live up to my hype. That being said, we finished on a storming note, with the Tipsy Cake. A baked brioche, crystal studded with sugar, cooked in cream, Sauternes and brandy. It came served with a slice of the pineapple from earlier mentioned spit roast and my rapidly expiring heart. Pudding perfection from 1810; no wonder they had a life expectancy of less than 45 back then.",

    "text": "WOOOWWWWW... seriously. One can only expect the best from the 3 star Michelin chef, Heston Blumenthal. The signature dish is the Meat Fruit appetiser, which... well. I don't want to really tell everyone the secrets before it opens (so I will be as discrete as possible). Let's just say that it's an experience, not just a dinner. He really does his homework. The flavors to his bread/icecream dessert dish came in 3 different steps. I was impressed. The chocolate bar was out-of-this world, intense and addictive. The slow roasted pineapple dessert was flavorful and intense. Now that dessert is done. I would not suggest the broth as an appetiser for people who like light flavors first. I found it a bit aggressive and a bit like miso soup, which is not bad, only, I wasn't expecting it, so it was a bit intense. My favourite starter was the meat fruit. It didn't feel like you were eating, it was so soft that you feel like you are imagining the food, yet the flavor is there and the taste is to die for. The ketchup in the scallops dish was quite a good addition to the meal. It was creative and impactful. The duck main dish was perfect. Absolutely perfect. The sauce was quite good with it, however, I regretted not trying something more experimental for my plate. The Beef plate was a huge favourite, unfortunately, too much of a favourite for there to be enough when I arrived. The fish was tender and fresh. The pigeon left me a bit confused. I didn't understand it's texture. It was extremely tender, delicious, but it left me with a confused feeling... as if I didn't feel like I was eating meat. The pork chop was to die for!!!!!! by far the winner of my favourite main dish. It was tender, packed with rich flavor and well... i don't know if i have ever experienced pork chop this way before. As for the wine, the selection was great, expensive, but great. The service was good. We were there before opening, so I imagine everyone was quite new. We didn't meet the chef, and this was the greatest let down we experienced. It would have been an honor to have met him. The architecture was ok. I didn't like it too much. the light fixtures looked like bunt cake pans... The private room was great (and the walls were leather) I wish the place looked more like that. It would have been much more authentic and less.... late 80s-early 90s modern. The only really cool thing about the architecture was the open windowed kitchen. That was great. It was fascinating to see the chefs at work while eating. This made it feel like a lab more than anything else. Reservation is a must and I believe there are no more available right now up until May. I guess you'll need some luck to get a place. I think you should go.",

    "text": "Call me oblivious, but I had no idea who Heston Blumenthal was until his name popped up in a NY Times list of places to go in 2011. I've since learned about the Fat Duck, etc., etc., so I was not totally ignorant when I walked into his new restaurant, but I didn't express any of the infantile cooing that might otherwise occur on other occasions.The meal was very good. It's possible that I'm spoiled (in fact, I am definitely spoiled, but whether this had an effect on my perception of the dinner is debatable), but the food didn't dazzle me. There were moments of awe (the baked lemon suet pudding in its caramel gooey-ness, the razor-thin rhubarb that looked like translucent sugar candy, the delightful finger limes that look like caviar and burst on your tongue like mini grapefruit, the astonishing sweetness of artichoke paired with succulent pigeon, the creamy mashed potatoes that very readily acknowledged their butter content). My companion started with the salamagundy (perfectly cooked chicken oysters, bone marrow, horseradish cream), continued with the pork chop (also perfectly cooked), and ended with the rhubarb sorbet. I had the roast scallops, spiced pigeon, and baked lemon pudding. We opted out of the tipsy cake, though the waiter did try hard to sell it to us. All in all, excellent quality, and for London the prices were not too bad. But still . . . at the end of the evening, it felt like something was missing. Had I walked in not knowing who Blumenthal was, I might have been more pleased, but my expectations were too high for what was offered.Having just read what I wrote, I think I've landed on the problem: it was perfect. Too perfect. So perfect it was boring. There was no edge, no excitement, no surprises (except perhaps the finger limes). Not that I need foam (foam is so pretentious), but there was nothing very risky about the menu. All in all, pleasant, but dull.",

    "text": "We went here for our wedding anniversary and where not dissapointed. \u00a0The restaurant is located inside the gorgeous and luxurious Mandarin Oriental hotel Hyde Park. Its the perfect setting for a 2 star Michelin restaurant and the ambiance is classy without beeing overbearing. \u00a0The service staff (and yes there are many) makes you feel right at home. \u00a0 I hade the very famous \"Meat fruit\" as a starter wich for the few that doesnt know is a chicken liver parfait dressed up to look like a mandarine. Served with a bit of toasted bread it was amazing with a creamy and smooth texture like no other parfait i have had before. \u00a0The great balancing act with the fatty parfait against the acidity of the \"mandarine shell\" was perfectly excecuted. The fil\u00e9 of Aberdeen Angus with mushroom ketchup and triple fried chips (yes fries for the americans) was cooked to perfection that for me is medium rare. The beef was so tender i could almost slice it with the fork and the flavor was so rich it ended way too fast. The condiments was simple but refined with the subtle mushroom flavor in the in house ketchup along with fries perfected by many many previous failures in the test kitchen. \u00a0Of course i had to go for the famous \"Tipsy Cake\" wich is a warm gooey piece of brioche soaked in liquore and cognac if i remember correct. Served with spit roasted pineapple this was the perfect ending on a great dinner experience even if im not a big dessert person. \u00a0Tasted my wifes \"Flesh & Rice\" , \"Powdered Duck Breast\" and \"Brown bread ice Cream\" and ther where all very very tasty. \u00a0Our bill without tip with a bottle of red came to 230 \u00a3 wich i find quite cheap for two Three course dinners with wine of this quality on a two star restaurant owned by one of the Worlds most famous chefs. The food is no joke either was so would recommend anyone who calls themselfs a foodie to eat at this food mecka.",

    "text": "Unfortunately a very disappointing dining experience. Despite being listed as a 2* Michelin restaurant and among the best in the world, the service was dire and the chefs lacked creativity.We dined in the private room and selected the 4 course menu. The food did not live up to our expectations:1) Rice & Flesh: undercooked rice2) Salmon or Meat Fruit: the salmon was ok but out of season. I couldn't fault the meat fruit but I could have purchased this at my local Waitrose..3) Steak: lacked seasoning. 4) Chocolate bar: chocolate and passionfruit do not work well together. A member of our party has a number of allergies and the chefs were informed of these at least a month in advance. We were very disappointed to learn that the 1st and 2nd course consisted of a plate of salad leaves! Not the level of creativity you'd expect in a Michelin star establishment. Aside from the disastrous food, we had to wait over an hour for our first course, and endured a lengthy wait between the other courses! Perhaps the idea was to get us drunk enough that we wouldn't remember our unfortunate dining experience!",

For example, Nobu in Vegas is a pale comparison to the real Nobu. \u00a0I felt like that about Dinner by HB. \u00a0I think maybe Dinner by HB has jumped the shark and is now overrun by the touristy crowd and the popular kids. \u00a0I found the whole experience of being in the room loud, obnoxious, and kind of disappointing. \u00a0Plenty of top restaurants are fun (check out The Clove Club) without losing their soul. \u00a0I can't say the same for this place.So my dilemma with a review like this is do I grade on a curve or not? \u00a0If so, in comparison to its Michelin starred peer group this place is a 3. \u00a0But if I graded on an absolute scale it would get a 4. \u00a0I'll go with 3 for my official rating, and definitely suggest you think about what you want for your fine dining dollars and whether you will get that here.",

    "text": "Dinner by Heston Blumenthal was an unforgettable meal while visiting London. This Michelin starred restaurant is located inside the beautiful Mandarin Oriental hotel. With British recipes hailing from the 13th-18th centuries, the menu itself is a marvel to read as it lets you know which year and cookbook the dish is inspired from.We started with the much buzzed about meat fruit which is chicken liver wrapped in a mandarin gel\u00e9e and served with grilled bread. I didn't think it could be as good as everyone was making it out to be but with one bite, I was in awe. This is definitely a must order as long as you enjoy foie gras. We also got the roast marrowbone which had snails, parsley, anchovy, mace and pickled vegetables. It was pretty good but the meat fruit definitely stole the show. For our mains, we ordered the powdered duck breast and Hereford ribeye with mushroom ketchup and triple cooked chips. The duck was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth unlike any other duck I've ever tried. The ribeye was also phenomenal. While it felt funny to be eating chips in such a fancy restaurant, these were the best cooked chips (french fries for Yankees) I've ever had. Seriously. At the beginning of the meal, our waiter suggested to preorder the tipsy cake for dessert and I'm so happy he did. It's like a boozy bread pudding with pineapple. Definitely a must order. We drank one of the finest red wines I've ever had during the meal, and finished with a Sauternes with our dessert. It was amazing how attentive the service was without being intrusive from beginning to end.As mentioned, the restaurant itself is beautiful. We were seated near one of the windows that lets you peer into the kitchen to see all the busy chefs at work. It was awesome!Definitely make your reservation at least a week before heading to London as it fills up fast. All in all, I wouldn't hesitate recommending Dinner by Heston Blumenthal to anyone looking for a nice meal out in London. I know I'll be dreaming of going back!",

Cutting into the facade, the meat fruit has an incredibly silky soft texture. The artisanal bread it came with is warm and chewy. A special experience!-Duck (5/5): grilled with skin and the moisture of the meat is nicely preserved. Nothing to complaint.-Goats milk cheese cake (5/5)-Ice Cream (5/5): They offer to make nitrogen infused ice cream right in front of you. A super cool experience.

    "text": "Simply one of the best meals of my life! \u00a0My friends and I made reservations here as we wanted to hit a Michelin-starred restaurant during our vacation. \u00a0Dinner is located within the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, a five-star hotel, and it reflects its surrounding. \u00a0Definitely a fine dining location. \u00a0Started with the Meat Fruit, a liver pate made to look like a mandarin orange, which was incredibly savory and full of flavor. \u00a0Normally I do not like liver, but this pate, especially when spread on the grilled bread, was phenomenal. \u00a0I followed this with the Lobster and Cucumber Soup. \u00a0Positively light and refreshing and a good contrast to the richness of the Meat Fruit. \u00a0For my main course I had the Roast Iberico Pork Chop. \u00a0Delicious and cooked to perfection. \u00a0The first dessert was the Spring Tart. \u00a0It was quite good, but the better dessert was clearly the Tipsy Cake, truly a stand out piece. \u00a0It explodes with flavor when you put the grilled pineapple with a piece of the cake itself. \u00a0Incredible. \u00a0The meal ended with the Nitrogen Ice Cream. \u00a0It was a lovely spectacle to watch as the waiter instantly made ice cream and topped it off with delicious toppings. \u00a0The service was very impressive. \u00a0The attentive waiters were incredibly knowledgeable about the food and gave fantastic recommendations to us all. \u00a0The staff truly know their craft. \u00a0Truly a must go.",

    "text": "Set inside the Edwardian-styled Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal immerses you into the sleek and sophisticated world of power dining. This is not an intimate two Michelin star affair, where you can luxuriate in a romantic candlelit dinner. This is a stylish corporate affair in a high-ceilinged room bathed in sunlight where you go to see and be seen. Ironically, I think Dinner might be a better place for lunch because the huge windows affords such attractive views of Hyde Park. The question then remains whether you can actually afford Dinner. Scanning the room, the restaurant seemed filled with well-heeled financiers, special-occasion diners, and suave older men spoiling their much-younger significant others.The cuisine at Dinner is decidedly modern British. Blumenthal pays homage to historic British gastronomy, dating all the way back to the 13th century, and reinvents them using modern techniques and preparations.The signature starter is the Meat Fruit (\u00a318.50), and it's as playful as it is delicious. It looks exactly like an orange, but once you pierce its gelatinous \"peel\" you find that it's filled with a creamy chicken liver parfait. You will no doubt wonder how it was fabricated, and you will probably examine it the whole time you are eating it. But it's a wonderful dish, one that stimulates the mind as much as it does the palate.The beautifully-composed Lobster & Cucumber Soup (\u00a325) is another delightful starter -- chilled lobster salad and smoked onion sitting on a cold rock samphire & sorrel soup. The flavors were clean and delicate, and the lobster was sweet and very fresh.For our main course, we ordered the Roast Iberico Pork Chop (\u00a340) -- with pointy cabbage, onions & Robert sauce -- and the Powdered Duck Breast (\u00a336) -- with smoked confit fennel, smoked beetroot, and umbles. The pork chop was the most rustic dish of our meal; it was thick, meaty, and smoky, and finished off with a drizzle of rich pork au jus. The duck was probably the most perfectly-cooked piece of duck I have ever had. It was incredibly moist and tender with a flawlessly crispy skin. And the fennel and beet accentuated the earthiness of the dish.The signature dessert here is the Tipsy Cake (\u00a314.50), and it's a nice way to end the meal. It's a brioche baked in a sweet liqueur, then served with spit-roasted pineapple. The pineapple was more tart than sweet, but it provided a nice counterbalance to the cake. The only thing that would have made it better is a scoop of ice cream.If I had to fault my dining experience, it would be for this: nothing at Dinner was spontaneous. Everything, from the food to the service, seemed completely rehearsed. From the beginning to the end, everything was polished and flawlessly executed ... almost to a fault. It would have been nice, for example, had our server not been so formal with us. But even though I didn't find Dinner by Heston Blumenthal the warmest and most hospitable place, my dinner by Heston Blumenthal was nonetheless very impressive.4 1/2 stars",

    "text": "We were visiting at a time when there would be no Fat Duck...so we looked around and decided to get a seat at this restaurant. Located in the Mandarin Oriental (and thanks to that we saw a Porsche 918 spyder!! Were!!!), the food are all recreations of historic British recipes -- with the year of publishing printed next to each dish. While the dishes might sound commonplace, the presentation and taste certainly wasn't.The biggest takeaway from this meal is that it was surprisingly light. This is meant as a compliment - by the end of the meal, while everyone felt fulfilled, no one thought they were going to die of a food coma, and our palates weren't slammed to the extreme. It was just clean, crisp and fresh, a very interesting way of presenting contemporary British food.I started with the salamagundy (chicken oysters!), had the roast pork chops as my meal, and rounded the meal out with the sambocade (goat cheese cake with fruits and nuts). The chicken oysters were delicately layered amongst different greens, while my favourite part of the pork chops dish was the roasted cabbage. Who would have thought such a humble vegetable would be the star of the dish? The sambocade, while exotic sounding, turned out to be a refreshing dessert made of goat cheese, resembling more of a cheese plate rather than a heavy sugary dessert. All in all, the flavours of the dishes weren't groundbreaking, but the care put into cooking the side dishes and the assembly of the plates were exemplary. It is one of the finest examples of culinary excellence.",

Though my boyfriend has his hmph and meh about certain dishes (his duck and octopus dish), he was enamored with mine (Cod and risotto). Never have I enjoyed Cod as much as I had! And the desserts were perfect to top the meal with! I must also add, the decaffeinated espresso...

We shared 3 between us - tipsy cake, brown bread ice cream and raspberry tart. OMFG that Tipsy Cake was to die for! So light, scrumptious, and so full of booze :-) The Brown Bread Ice Cream was interesting, not to my taste, but it was an interesting experience. I loved the Raspberry Tart, but after the Tipsy Cake it sadly had to come second.The wait staff were quite lovely, I got a little chocolate mousse cup with a birthday message on the plate.

They overheard me asking my fiance where the bathroom was so they escorted me there directly. What I love about it though is that the service is very relaxed and unfussy. Not snooty at all as it can be a bit in some michelin-starred places.And the food is wonderful. We only had a main and dessert as we knew how full we'd be otherwise. I had the roast halibut with roe and mussel/seaweed ketchup. So yummy and a well-cooked piece of fish. Also ordered a side of mashed potato which was ridiculously buttery and decadent. For dessert I had the 'chocolate bar' which is hard to describe but essentially a very dense dark chocolate mousse thing with a passion fruit layer served with lovely ginger ice cream. My fiance had the Tipsy cake which i highly recommend too - the lightest brioche ever with delicious grilled pineapple. Outstandning.",

This will be a simple, non-poncy, maybe slightly pedantic, review of a restaurant that is a paradigm of good service and an excellent kitchen.The restaurant itself is beautiful, simple, airy, with very high ceilings (the way ceilings should be) and despite being in the middle of London, somehow, somewhere, it has found a garden, or a park, or just a clustering of grass, bushes and trees to have outside some magnificent bay windows. I sat facing them on the longest day of the year, the sun shining in and onto my table. Idyllic.The menu was simple, and wrapped around it was a small piece of cardboard which shouldn't go unnoticed. Open it up. And read. And learn some piece of trivia.As I said, service was excellent. Water was refilled, questions asked and answered at the right time and the right tone and mood. Everything was perfect. Then. The food came. And made me giggle. The chicken liver parfait is shaped like a mandarine! I thought oh, how cute, we're in the Mandarin Oriental! (hotel) It was also delicious. And for the first time in a very long time (definitely the first time in England \u00a0the english being notoriously stingy on water and bread- and not always a lucky occurrence in France) I had plenty of bread to eat nearly all of my pate! Looooved it!Next up: Steak. Rump steak. YUM! But you see the most delicious part of the dish wasn't the meat. Oh the irony. It was of course the chips!! Heston truly has mastered the art of the french fry. Well done. Thank you. Now if my choices were wider than Dinner by Heston at the Mandarin Oriental vs. Frites Antoine in Brussels' Place Jourdan, I would be one happy (if slightly heftier) bunny!As for dessert I got the giggles again. Their signature dessert is called Tipsy cake. How inimitable. Had someone actually called it that back in 1810? Apparently so. Now all I need is to secure myself a copy of that cookery book and I will be able to have that delicious, divine, spongy brioche dribbling with delicate sweetness, hot from the oven, at my heart's content. And probably to the delight of any of my friends (and partner) willing to trek all the way to Woking for it. Will come out to Surrey for Tipsy cake. Yes. Well I came in from Surrey for it. And I damn well would again!!",

    "text": "We came with high expectations and were sorely disappointed. The bar in Mandarin had beautiful drinks and the glasses were stunning. It's certainly worth visiting and having a drink or two. However, upon entering the dining hall at 7.30 we felt like we had walked into lunch hour. For being a 5 star Michelin restaurant, the dress code was causal. We felt overdressed! We paid \u00a3900 for dinner for four persons and I feel like the food was decent and extremely overpriced. We ordered the meat fruit which was amazing, the best dish in the restaurant. However, the ribeye was terrible, it was thin and nothing to write home about. My partner ordered the pigeon and it was okay. The table enjoyed tipsy cake and said it was very good. If you are looking for an amazing wine list, look no further. You will enjoy being well attended by knowledgable staff. The location is amazing, there is no place like Hyde Park and Knightsbridge high street.",

    "text": "We had a good friend coming into town and wanted a special evening out. \u00a0With all of the hype in the NYT, Heston Blumenthal seemed like an obvious choice. \u00a0Well, that is until we call to make a reservation. \u00a0We dined at Heston Blumenthal in early May. \u00a0However, when I called the reservation line, the answer phone stated that they were all booked until August....\"if you'd like to make a reservation in September, please hold the line.\"Luckily, our friend has an American Express Centurion card and was able to call and get an exclusive reservation.After all of the hoopla of getting a reservation, our expectations for dinner were already pretty high.Ok - onto the experience:We started the evening by ordering a very nice bottle of White Burgundy from Puligny-Montrachet. \u00a0I have to say that the wine list is much better in person - and there is a lot missing from their website. \u00a0The list was quite good and you could also see a good majority of the temperature-controlled wine celler from the main dining area.As I'm sure most do, I ordered the meat fruit (c. 1500) for my first course. It was a chicken liver parfait which was served in the shape of \u00a0Mandarin. \u00a0Very clever - and equally as tasty! \u00a0For my second course, I had the Roast Turbot (c. 1830). \u00a0This white fish was prepared perfectly and served with cockle ketchup and chicory leaves. \u00a0For dessert, I had the Tipsy cake (c.1810). \u00a0Really, there is only one word to describe this: \u00a0INCREDIBLE! \u00a0Probably the best dessert that I've ever had at a restaurant. \u00a0The Tipsy Cake is a buttery cake that is served with a spit roast pineapple which had been roasting for minimum of 4 hours. \u00a0This was the talk of our meal!Overall, we had a really nice dining experience and good service. \u00a0Heston Blumenthal, regardless of the Fat Duck connection, is a fantastic spot for a very nice meal. \u00a0The meal was expensive, but worth it for a special treat.",

    "text": "I have been here three times now and I hope to be back soon.Service: I have had the same waiter, \u00a0I believe his name is John-Lucca, every time and I am certain the management staff planned that on purpose. We love him! We also love the rest of the staff, every one of them has been trained to a high standard and it shows. Not only are they highly professional but they're also incredibly nice and fun to chat to. Food: The food is phenomenal. I had never been to one of Heston's restaurants before but I am now a loyal fan. I love how inventive his dishes are. I think the idea behind Dinner has really worked well with Heston taking what was surely a so-so dish favorited however many years ago by this king or that queen and recreated it so that it is something fantastic and applicable to this day and age. \u00a0The presentation is always something special as well. \u00a0The Meatfruit is the most delicious pate I have ever tasted. \u00a0In terms of the mains I love the duck and the steak in particular and all of the desserts are worth trying but especially the ice cream, which is not to be missed.Value: I would rather spend \u00a3100 pounds at Dinner than \u00a320 at some other sub-par restaurant. \u00a0Eating out should always be treated as a special occasion and therefore as a diner, one should always aim to eat somewhere different and special. \u00a0Dinner is definitely different and is absolutely worth every penny because it's so special . \u00a0I cannot recommend it enough.",

We started the evening with a drink at the hotel's bar. As soon as our table was ready we were taken through, where our first waiter greeted my mum with a \"I hear we're celebrating your special birthday this evening?\" which was a lovely touch. From then on, everything was a blur. The incredible wine list, attentive friendly knowledgable service, the beautiful decor... that's all before mentioning the food! As a peskitarian I often dread meals out, fearing I'd be left with the booby-food prize. But with delicious Scallops and cucumber ketchup followed my the best cod and mussles I'd ever eaten I was in food heaven. I then opted for brown bread ice cream, which was devine. Finally, we were given complimentary Earl Gray ganache for my mum's birthday, served by the Maitre D, who also wished my mum a very happy birthday. Heston - your staff and chef's did you proud - they made for a memorable, special evening in fabulous surroundings. Book early, ask for a window table, start saving your pennies!",

It came with a rather interesting and unique combination of sides as well that are better experienced than described. The meat was cooked to perfection. The Tipsy Cake for dessert was awesome. The brioche was warm and moist, and the pineapple gave it just the right kick.The only thing I would change is that the salted caramel ice cream dessert was just a tad too sweet, but it was still enjoyable. I miss this place already. I don't understand how this has a four-star average on Yelp at this time when one compares with the ratings of Le Gavroche (which I strongly recommend skipping) and L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (which is fine but nothing like this). Heston Blumenthal is a culinary genius, and I take my hat off.",

    "text": "nya-nya-nya-nya...nya.We got in to Dinner at Heston's on a Saturday night and if I wasn't such a nice bloke I would have been gloating all day Fri after my partner let me know this is where we were going for my birthday.Such excitement.Black cab down there. Boys in red opening the door. All good. Into the grand place and straight to the bar for a livener.The bar was a little unspectacular to be honest and the drinks took an age so we wandered into the dining room with them.Staff very welcoming, room very comfy, not too formal which is always my fear with hotel dining. Nice jelly moulds on the wall. Tables spacious. Menu wonderful. Lots of old english classics from the 1600s etc and a little literature on their history. This is a real occasion and if you're bothered about all that, very interesting.The bread came and was rather a disappointment though. Four slices of sort of toasted bread which was far too brittle to be pleasant in the mouth. The kind of stuff that scratches the roof of the mouth and leaves you rather sore. And frankly the taste wasn't up to much if you like your bread sour as well as chewy. Oh well!For starter I ordered Salamugundy which sounds like a Bond villain but is actually the 'oysters' of the chicken - those bits at the bottom of the carcass you dig out that nobody else is greedy enough to find. I love 'em and thought I was the only one who knew the secret. But clearly Heston does.The missus ordered hay smoked mackerel. My salamugundy was as pretty as a picture when it came, decorated with chicory leaves that looked like devil's horns. The blobs of marrow bone were beautifully decorated with crunchy breadcrumbs. The whole thing was a solid effort taste wise. The mackerel was delicious. Small bannetons of the fish, beautifully trimmed and gently cooked. You could have mistaken it for being raw but something had gone on and the texture was great.For mains I ordered roast halibut with cockle ketchup. The missus ordered fillet steak and chips.Halibut is an amazing fish. But once it's overdone it becomes dense and a bit of a dry mouthful. Guess what? Mine was overdone. What a crying shame. The cockle sauce was divine. It really was. But the bit I was craving was just a dense block. Gutted. Me, not the fish, you understand.The missus ordered her fillet steak medium so got what she deserved when it came out exactly like she had asked for it. I could tell that it used to be a wonderful piece of meat. The chips however were, again, a let down. Triple cooked? If that's what happens to them when they are triple cooked I'd prefer the double or single cooked version every time. They were leathery and not fluffy inside like chips should be. I reckon they had been left for a long while out of the fryer, that's how they came across anyhow. There was a mushroom ketchup which was good and the gravy that came in a small jug was delicious.But I have to say, there were a few things with the meal that really disappointed. You don't expect to go to a place with such a reputation and get your main course halibut overcooked. You don't expect the chips to be leathery. And you don't expect the bread to be so crunchy as to make it almost wholly unmanageable once the teeth have cracked it into the mouth. I felt like Monsieur Mange Tout, that circus bloke who ate glass and things when I was a kid. As I said there were real highlights to the cooking but these things really brought it down. A real shame as the service was delightful. A lovely chatty sommelier who had all the time in the world for an old ignoramus like me. And a young waiter only too keen to let us know any detail we wanted about the food.We came for an amazing experience but left feeling slightly disappointed and short changed. We spent over \u00a3200 and only had one bottle of wine and for that money you'd expect something approaching perfection. We deffo didn't get that. In fact, I'd call it a little careless. The problems were all wholly avoidable with a bit more care and attention.Ah well. You win some you lose some.We chatted together about places we had been to that had been as extravagant but simply better and came up with a good list. And thought of a fair few that were better and a lot cheaper too.I must say though, I got food envy when I saw the couple next to us tucking into their meat fruit starter. It looked great! Shame we won't be rushing back to try it.",

    "text": "Dinner was a delight! \u00a0I dined there with my partner in August as a special date night and the food is still devastatingly memorable in my mind. \u00a0Mmmmmm...Firstly, I have to say the service was unbelievable. \u00a0The manager was so gracious and warm---we had accidentally forgotten to cancel one of our reservations (we hadn't been certain when we would return from a trip abroad so had also made reservations for lunch the following day) which would, by policy, have us incur at least a 50\u00a3 charge. \u00a0He immediately said it was alright and he just wanted us to have a good time that night. \u00a0It would definitely have been soured with a cancellation fee! \u00a0Our servers were really wonderful. \u00a0I think their names were Leianne and Wanda. \u00a0Wanda was especially warm and friendly, completely unpretentious, so attentive---she was so comfortably helpful, I felt like she was my best friend. \u00a0Really a top-notch server.Walking into the restaurant, it is immediately a very romantic and extravagant mood. \u00a0Dim but accented well, I felt it embodied the concept of the menu---a tribute to history and tradition while cleverly innovating with elegance. \u00a0I wish we had taken some time to view the open kitchen but we were so consumed with the food!THE FOOD. \u00a0We felt the meat fruit was compulsory given the buzz around it. \u00a0I had hesitated because I normally don't really like pate but the flavor and texture of this was AMAZING! \u00a0Perfection. And the presentation of encapsulating it within a jelly mandarin orange (even looked bumpy like a real peel!) was really fabulous. \u00a0Licked every bit of that pate up! \u00a0The salamugundy was so delectable! \u00a0The chicken oysters were seriously the most delicious, savory pieces of chicken I have ever had! \u00a0They were delicious with the marrow and horseradish cream.For mains, we had the spiced pigeon and pork chop. \u00a0I had never had pigeon before but I now know that I love it. \u00a0It's a bit like duck, very rich reddish flesh---and it was cooked so well. \u00a0Juicy, juicy, juicy. \u00a0I honestly can't remember the pork chop very well since it wasn't my dish but I do remember my boyfriend gobbling it up with gusto. \u00a0Oh, and we got some carrots on the side which were good but nothing very special.We toyed with the idea of getting 2 desserts but honestly, we were so full by this time. \u00a0We ordered the tipsy cake and omg, I wish we had ordered three. \u00a0The pillowy sweet bread just melts in your mouth. \u00a0And the roasted pineapple was the perfect complement. \u00a0It was quite an expensive meal---it added up with the wine and tea (which was also of unique and excellent quality) we had also ordered. \u00a0But it was a lovely treat for a romantic evening!",

So we sat at our table while i got more \u00a0and more mad and embarrassed thinking that they were going to ask us to leave. They didn't. They were kind and solicitous the whole time and when she finally got there, our delicious meal started. I ordered Fillet of Aberdeen Angus which was very small yet amazing. The bread that they brought the table was delicious. The fries were heavenly as well. I tasted the other steak because Jovanie had ordered it as well as the pork that Adrienne had ordered. Everything was impeccable . We had two different waiters, one ,who i called Andy Murray, because he sounded and looked a lot like him, was an a amazing server all the way through the meal. Very professional and friendly. Up until this point, i was very dubious about British cuisine as well as British service but this place redeemed all of my doubts. If you have the money , or at least the credit left on your card, eat here. We got the tipsy cake and they also make ice cream with liquid nitrogen tables die, so you know i had to have it. While the ice cream was very tasty, the tipsy cake was amazing.Tipsy cake.",

    "text": "\"Dinner\" was certainly the most hyped new restaurant opening in London in 2011. It shouldn't come as a surprise since it is Heston Blumenthal's restaurant. I had gone to \"Fat Duck\" for lunch shortly after Dinner opened, and it blew my mind. I was determined to try Heston's establishment that was closer to home. It's incredibly difficult to get a decent dinner reservation here, though nowhere as hard as Fat Duck. But if you are prepared to have a late dinner, and by late I mean 10 pm or later, then you can be lucky. The four of us reached here for such a late dinner one evening in October. But the table wasn't ready yet. That came as a surprise, given the time. But we didn't have to wait long. Soon after ordering a round of drinks at the bar, we were ushered in to our table. The dining hall is a separate room from the bar, and it's huge. But it has poor acoustics. Throughout the meal we found it difficult to hear each other at normal volume. Dinner specialises in historical British cuisine. The menu contains items from the 14th century onwards (the dates of origin are mentioned in the menu) ... Dishes that are not eaten anywhere else at present. It's an exciting trip down the history of British food. If you go in a bigger group, then you will be able to sample more chapters of that history. The starters was the most interesting section. I was torn between \"meat fruit\", \"broth of lamb\" and \"rice and flesh\". I settled on the broth of lamb, an 18th century dish that was served with egg, radish and turnip. I also sampled the meat fruit from a friend ... It was a mandarin orange stuffed with chicken liver. I left the rice and flesh, one of the oldest dish on the menu (from 1390), for next time. I went for a more conventional main course. \u00a0From amongst the pork chops and the halibut and the pigeons, I picked the fillet of Aberdeen Angus, well done. It was served with mushroom sauce, a novel accompaniment to a steak for me. For dessert I went against the house recommendation of the \"tipsy cake\" and ordered the pudding instead and I did not regret my choice. The three course meal, with a glass of wine and one cocktail, cost us about \u00a380 per person. It wasn't cheap but it wasn't much more expensive than what we had expected. The food and the presentation was great, and Dinner thoroughly deserves its one Michelin star. But no, it isn't the 9th best restaurant in the world ... That would be too much of a stretch.",

We topped off our two courses of starter and meal with three additional courses of dessert!If you have the chance to eat here, do so!",

    "text": "This restaurant comes near to a perfect restaurant experience. Service begins with somewhat hidden podium where the hostess greets confused guests as they try to figure out if going straight up the stairs is the right way. You are then escorted into a beautiful bar area and finally to a dining room that is spacious, beautifully designed and hosts a fancy but non-intrusive glass wall by the kitchen.I started this food journey with their famous whole-lotta-facebook-shared iconic meat fruit, which is this cute mandarin-looking chicken liver with crispy garlic bread. I can definitely eat 4 of these without much effort, and the presentation is naturally outstanding.My main - the pork chop, was simply good and perfectly cooked. Granted, it does not come with any amazing or surprising bells and whistles, but it serves its purpose and is quite filling.Lastly, after the experience that far, I had to sample some desserts. There were two that stood out, one for its meat fruit-like exquisite presentation (the chocolate egg), and another for its traditional British tribute (the tipsy cake). The egg was absolutely gorgeous, with every fine detail you would expect. I was not a huge fan of the citrusy yolk, but I also recognize that this is just a taste preference, rather than a quality issue. And then, there was the tipsy cake that, without a doubt, stole the prize in the latter portion of the meal. It was sweet, fluffy and flaky, not too eggy, delicious, not soggy at all. It was a perfect blend of all great bread pudding ideas, and implemented equally well.",

They do a 3 course lunch tasting menu for about \u00a350 that they are very flexible on. They will let you swap out or upgrade almost any item you want. The staff here is extremely profession, the epitome of fine dining, minus any bit of being pretentious. The menu is designed from historical recipes and it shows the year or time period the recipe was first created in. It's like time traveling through culinary history. The ambiance here is excellent, perfect for a romantic dinner or a business lunch with colleagues you are trying to impress. The cocktail program is pretty good but I was more impressed with the food. The wait staff was super professional without being pretentious. As for the food...Meat Fruit - This Foie Gras dish is one of their best known items and it is not only delicious but it is like a work of art. It is slightly sweet and very savory. I would recommend this to any fan of Foie.Iberico Pork - Perfectly cooked and plated. Very high quality meat. Not much else to say other than I really enjoyed it.Tipsy Cake - Another item they are famous for. They slow roast the pineapples for 5 hours, the cake is perfectly moist, and the vanilla sauce at the bottom is to die for. Not as visually stunning as their other items but it might be the best tasting.",

Meat Fruit looked beautiful and tasted nice and smooth, I can't believe it is from ancient receipts back to 13-15 centuries. Dressed Snails was not hard to chew. Roasted Quail was tender and tasty.

    "text": "Stunning. Dinner by Heston delivers the total package: splendid environs, outstanding cuisine and attentive service. It is my favorite resto in London (thus far). Quite a unique concept whereby each dish is born out of a classic recipe (references provided!) dating from as far back as the Late Middle Ages. Don't fret - they are most assuredly updated for present day. The food was simply excellent all around. Wine list is voluminous and has some great finds, and excellent tea menu to conclude. Service was on point and extremely attentive. High recommend visiting if you are in the area; no question it deserves the two Michelin stars.Atmosphere- Expansive, airy dining room with beautiful design, as is found throughout the M.O. London.- Clearly upscale, but in a modern sense without being stifling. Not too formal.- Patrons wore a variety of attire, but generally 'smart casual'.- Decent spacing between tables.FoodLoved the concept of queuing off classic British recipes but updating them for the modern era. By the looks of it, without being told, this concept is not obvious. I like that - it means the food is not the least intimidating, but does have a cool lineage. This is almost beside the point, as the food was just plain delicious in and of itself. Execution was generally tight and precise. We enjoyed the:- Meat Fruit (Mandarin, Chicken Liver Parfait, Grilled Bread - \u00a321.00): Mandarin orange gelee made the dish; stunning presentation; only nit the bread was a tad oily. Highly recommend.- Earl Grey Tea Cured Salmon (Lemon Salad, Gentleman's Relish, Exmoor Caviar - \u00a319.50): Delicate and balanced flavors, the earl gray treatment rather unique.- Powdered Duck Breast (Braised & Grilled Red Cabbage, Spiced Umbles, Pickled Cherries - \u00a344.00): Must order! Our favorite entree, such a lovely combination of flavors and perfect cook on the duck.- Roast Iberico Pork Chop (Pea's Pudding, Blood Pudding, Pickled Onion & Mint Oil - \u00a344.50): Sadly, the pork was overcooked and a tad dry, but the flavors were still nice. Blood pudding in limited use, as a garnish mostly.- Buttered Purple Sprouting Broccoli (\u00a35.50): A side, which was nice though mundane.- Tipsy Cake (Spit Roast Pineapple - \u00a316.00): Favorite dessert! The sauce on top of the cake plus roasted pineapple are divine. Decadent in just the right way.- Brown Bread Ice Cream (Salted Butter Caramel, Pear & Malted Yeast Syrup - \u00a315.00): Another solid dessert, though perhaps a tad less memorable than the former.BeverageWe began with a glass of the 2009 Mo\u00ebt & Chandon Grand Vintage Brut (\u00a316), which was nice, and the Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum Gin, St Germain, Peach Syrup, Mo\u00ebt et Chandon 2009 - \u00a321) which was alright, if overpriced.The wine list is expansive and contained an interesting array of options across price points. It would be nice if the list could be posted online for perusal in advance. With dinner, we truly loved the 2012 Domaine du Vieux Telegraphe Chateauneuf-du-Pape 'La Crau' (\u00a3139), an excellent and decently priced option from the Rh\u00f4ne. To conclude, there is an excellent tea menu featuring Jing loose teas. Staff were happy to re-infuse the tea multiple times. We fancied the Silver Needle White Tea (\u00a36.50).Service- Absolute professionals; warm and friendly - happily obliged our requests and answered questions.- When there was an issue with overcharging my credit card, the assistant manager promptly apologized and remedied the situation on the spot.- 13.5% service charge automatically included.",

    "text": "At Dinner, Heston Blumenthal heavily draws his inspiration from historic British dishes. Next to each item on the menu, you can find the approximate decade that the dish originated from. The back page, meanwhile, lists exactly which cookbooks the recipes are based off of. There is even a separate sheet that details the origins of the first afternoon tea. Interesting stuff!The service and ambiance at Dinner are nothing short of stellar. The restaurant is, after all, located in the Mandarin Oriental. With its delicious food and gorgeous presentations, this 2-Michelin starred restaurant is easily one of my favorites in London. In fact, my dining experience here convinced me that I now have to visit The Fat Duck (but perhaps after several more paychecks). It also got me to check out the renowned chef's cookery program called \"Heston's Feasts\". You should have a look too; it's quite the series.// Meat Fruit (c.1500) (\u00a318.50) - 5 starsThis appetizer is so aesthetically pleasing that you will not want to cut it open. It is a chicken liver and foie gras parfait enclosed in a thin layer of mandarin-infused jelly. The ingredients complement each other well, as the paste is neither too heavy nor too light. // Spiced Pigeon (c.1780) (\u00a340.00) - 4 starsThe pigeon was perfectly seasoned with a crisp skin and juicy meat. I devoured this fowl to the bone since it was so succulent and tender. Everything about the dish was brilliant. I just wish the price tag weren't so steep.// Tipsy Cake (c.1810) (\u00a314.50) - 5 starsNuggets of pillowy-soft brioche balls drenched in brandy cream, served with a slice of spit roasted pineapple. If that description doesn't get your taste buds going, I don't know what will.",

    "text": "Dinner has been recommended by a couple fellow foodies so I thought I'd treat a couple of my staff to celebrate a job well done for this London visit.Dinner is located inside the 5 star Mandarin Oriental and the service from the moment we stepped out of our ride until we left demonstrated why this hotel and the restaurant is worthy of the high praises and prices.To reach the dining room we walked through some narrow corridors and up a flight of stairs that sort of took us back to a bygone century. \u00a0The dining room itself is fairly modern. \u00a0The food served at Dinner is sort of a celebration of English food heritage mixed with some modern day creativity.The signature Meat Fruit was indeed worthy of it popularity. \u00a0The chicken liver parfait was encapsulated in a perfectly deceiving Mandarin orange peel made with marzipan. \u00a0The liver pate was smooth and full of flavor without any unpleasant bitterness.The Salamangundy was a dish dated back circa 1720 consisted of several of the precious chicken oysters (those 2 small oval shaped tenders at the top of the chicken thighs where they connect with the backbone), crunchy salsify and marrow atop a delicious horseradish cream was probably my favorite dish.The bone-in Hereford prime rib had that nice dry-aged flavor that is slightly smoky and livery. \u00a0 The mushroom catchup went well with the trice fried chips. \u00a0I would have to say though that I'd expect a 2 star restaurant would have served a better marbled piece of beef. \u00a0The fat on this particular piece was not evenly distributed therefore it was not as tender I had expected even if they did sous vide it.While the signature dessert, Tipsy cake, was good it didn't blow me away. \u00a0The brioche was great; but the pineapple was not sweet. \u00a0I also thought the spit roasting was a bit of overkill. \u00a0The open flame grilled pineapple served at some churrascarias would have served the same purpose without the elaborate roaster and the length of time it took to prepare it here. \u00a0The open flame would have also helped better caramelize a coat of sugar on it, too.The salted butter caramel on the brown bread ice cream was also a little too salty that it overpowered the sweetness of the ice cream, the pear and the cake underneath.The prices at Dinner was fairly reasonable by London's standard. \u00a0Expect to fork over about 100 quids per person sans drinks. Overall, besides the Meat Fruit and Salamangundy, the rest of the meal while good didn't really blow me away.",

    "text": "Stellar fine dining experience that doesn't leave you feeling you're hungry or penniless after. The decor is modern and the space is quite large and cavernous. On a Thursday night, it was lively though not completely full and it wasn't too loud. Service is stellar with so many people working your table around the clock you start to lose track of who does what cause they all want to make sure you are enjoying your meal.Meat Fruit (4.5/5) - The signature dish doesn't disappoint. It's visually stunning and it tastes fantastic. I'm not sure if I'd repeat it again if I came back mostly cause the novelty wears off quickly but I applaud the artistic mastery at play here and the fact it doesn't sacrifice taste. It does taste relatively light compared to getting foie gras or bone marrow.Iberico Pork Chop (4/5) - Perfectly cooked so it's very tender and moist. The accompanying side had a weird texture (I think the splet wheat was covered in some sort of fat) that just felt a little unusual. Brussel Sprout Side (3/5) - Nothing extraordinary here. Just your usual veggies.Powdered Duck Breast (4/5) - Also expertly cooked. The long thick cut was nice and a welcome reprieve from the usual small medallion like cuts for Western style duck. I found it very moist though personally I prefer a crispier skin but as I'm not sure the cooking technique here used, may not be appropriate. Tipsy Cake (5/5) - hands down one of the best desserts I've ever had. It looks super simple but it has incredible flavors which is what ultimately counts. The spit roasted pineapple is delicious and tastes so decadent you can't believe it was a regular old pineapple a hour before (you have to pre-order when you sit down). The brioche buns are just heavenly.Overall, I thought this place didn't disappoint and the starter and dessert nailed it. I thought the pricing was very reasonable given the level of quality here, and because they let you order a la carte (rather than force you into some really long set menu) I came away feeling it was a relatively great value all things considered as long as you were ordering a normal amount of food (3 courses).-Victor",

The food was outstanding and the service was also perfect. Apparently Heston Blumenthal has 3 other restaurants in London, and one of the others is a 3 star Michelin restaurant (Fat Duck). I can only imagine what that tastes like. We'll definitely try and get a reservation there the next time we visit London. I can't recommend this restaurant enough, but be warned that you'll need to make reservations well in advance.",

    "text": "So I came in forewarned by a lot of people that Dinner was a bit of an overhyped, possibly overrated dining experience - but as I didn't have a lot of time to change spots for Christmas Day dinner, I decided to stick with it, as I thought the concept was certainly worth enjoying. The entrance itself is to the left of the lobby once you walk inside the opulent Mandari Oriental's entrance, which is decked out quite nicely for Christmas (although it did remind me a bit of Melania Trump's somewhat eerie sensibilities when it came to Christmas decoration). For some reason, we were told to wait at the bar, and just as we were order our drinks, we were then shown in...to a dining room that was quite empty. I also wasn't a huge fan of how the seating was distributed; while there is a main dining area that has pretty similar views and decor for everyone, there is a small sliver near the exit from the kitchen that also houses seats. A minor nit at most, but it also meant that I felt I had a very lackadaisical view (since I was not facing the dining room). We also had a side view of the kitchen, which meant we had a less straightforward view of what was going on. Despite this, the servers were quite friendly and amiable, explaining each dish and giving us a bit more information on what was done (particularly the Tipsy cake). The wine selection by the glass was interesting; I went a bit bold and went with a Chinese red wine - I quite liked it, as it was big, full of tannins and a bit on the spicier side.The food selection is a la carte - no tasting menus, unlike most restaurants of this caliber - and the year of each menu item's original recipe (along with the title of the source) is included. It's quite novel, but on balance, I think the concept is more fun than how the food for a 2-star Michelin restaurant should turn out. I started with the sherried scallops, which I actually liked - very refreshing, with the sherry giving a nice acidic offset to the earthy (but light) mushroom broth. The scallops were pretty fresh as well, making the dish appropriate for winter but with less gravity than I would have expected. My wife's octopus was pretty decent as well - cooked quite well, although not really as remarkable flavors as I have had at other spots (it's hard to compare to Spanish preparation). We went with the bone-in ribeye to share, and this is where I think the chefs could have done better. The meat itself was delicious, and I really liked how it was cooked. I didn't care for the mushroom ketchup, and the triple-cooked fries that were served alongside were excellent. That said, there was so much fat on the ribeye that both of us had a decent amount of inedible meat stacked up on our plates once we were done. To be blunt, that kind of meat would be something I expect at a lower/mid-range restaurant that doesn't specialize in meats; here, it made me wonder how closely the cuts are actually inspected before being purchased. Dessert was excellent; I really did enjoy the Tipsy Cake and its light yet intensely sweet flavors. The spit-roasted pineapples are overrated, though; there was barely any caramelization or extra sweetness despite how prominently they are displayed in the kitchen (and the website).The food here? Certainly not bad and definitely above average. Is it worth the price? Certainly not, and that is what gives me pause about saying I would bother coming back. Like the concept, didn't love the ambiance, and the food was inconsistent at best. It's a curiosity that, if you really have the itch to burn money, you can visit - but given the diversity of options available in London, it should be further down on the list of choices.",

    "text": "Oh no. Really? 3? How we looked forward to this meal - getting a reservation here was one of the main reasons we chose to visit London for a very special weekend. Alas, disappointing main courses, iffy sommelier recommendations and not so special service really were a letdown.First, the meat fruit and the rice and flesh really are exquisite. Do get them both. They will blow you away.Main courses were a hard choice for us: with 3 versions of the same dish (the steak with mushroom gravy), we felt compelled to try it, but given the description of our server of the iberico pork chop (succulent, juicy, well-marbled) and duck breast (unique, pickled components, brightness), we felt we were making a solid decision on the mains. Unfortunately, both were overcooked (they were advertised as being served pink - the duck was brown through and through and the pork chop solid white) and neither really had anything particularly interesting to offer. The duck was fine, the pork chop was dry and totally devoid of any flavor. The description of gloriously piquant flavors for the one and deep smoky porkiness on the other were clearly goals rather than actual delivery. \u00a0They just didn't live up to our expectations at all.One final indignity on the mains: we ordered a side of the thrice cooked chips, and they were served in the same tiny cup as when you order the steak and they are meant to serve as a component. For 6.50, I expected that they would be a larger portion. There were a sum total of about 12 chips in there - they were very good, but not a reasonable portion for an additional side.The tipsy cake was indeed very good. Do order it. The cocktail menu was mind boggling but also extremely expensive - the priciest we've seen in London. They were, however, very good drinks. Sommelier recommendations on the wine did not live up to their descriptions - I wish we had gone with our own direction. We also had to ask repeatedly for service throughout the meal - we waited endlessly while the sommelier chatted up a nearby table, finally asked to see the wine list elsewhere, and apparently they only have one list to share in the entire section! Very odd.We were never checked on by our server, and actually had to flag her down to share our disappointment with the cooking on the main dish. Also, a minor point, but we asked for tap water and after our first few glasses, we were asked if we wanted to open \"another bottle\". We said that we had asked for tap, which was fine with us. When we reviewed the bill, they had charged us for a bottle of water despite our initial request (and despite the fact that the \"bottled\" water was served from the same jug as the tap we later received).Finally, I get the theme of the old cookery, but that doesn't mean that the menu should stay stagnant from here to eternity. I think it needs a little sprucing up...perhaps Heston needs to make a return visit from Oz to retool the menu, as it seems like recent reviews have been less favorable.Oh well. If you want a special meal in London, go to the Ledbury or the Clove Club. If you do wish to come here, order 2 first courses each and the dessert. Skip the mains. You'll be happy you did. And lower your expectations about service - whomever is running the front of the house clearly has other ideas.",

    "text": "My perfect Christmas dinner at Bar Boulud held the position of My Best Meal of 2011 for all of two days before being surpassed by tonight's experience at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. The once in a lifetime meal I'd looked forward to for 10 years that I had at Thomas Keller's French Laundry just in January 2011 unbelievably has fallen to a third position. Only three days in London and my expectations have been superseded. Incredibly both Bar Boulud and Dinner by Heston Blumenthal are in the same Mandarin Oriental hotel. Therefore I'm uncertain if I'm taken with London's culinary scene or simply with that of the hotel. \"Dinner\" surpassed Bar Boulud in food, service, and atmosphere. A view of the lit London Eye from our window side table created a romantic setting supported by the softly lit and dark wood dining room. I wish I was more articulate when it comes to writing about food. To avoid attempting to capture the sublime I'll simply state what we ordered and trust you order the same to complete the translation:* The appropriately acclaimed Meat Fruit (we needed to order a second toast for this \"pate\"* Lemon pickled mackerel (exceeded any piece of sushi Spanish mackerel I've had)* Cod and Fried Mussels (Erin's Main)* Powdered (salted/seasoned) Duck Breast with roast fennel and duck hearts * Tipsy Cake (brioche, sweet rum syrup, grilled pineapple - all the dessert you'll needI think I over-stated myself placing Bar Boulud ahead of French Laundry, congratulations Thomas Keller you've reclaimed #2, sorry Daniel Boulud. However Heston Blumenthal reigns if for no other reason than he seared my sous-vide duck breast before serving. The dining room is grand next to The Laundry's charming. French Laundry had superior flawless service. What a superb experience  bit.ly/ugLIh0",

A bit pricey (\u00a330 - \u00a340 for a main; \u00a315 - \u00a320 for a starter) and thus less of a value than somewhere like Avenue or Vivat Bachhus, it still is a much better experience for the money than Galvin La Chapelle. And you will only spend a bit less around the corner at Buddha Bar, an overpriced, overly trendy, good but not great food, disappointment.I would be more than happy to go to \"Dinner\" again, with friends or colleagues, and especially to celebrate a special occasion or a visitor from the States. You will love it, I'm certain. Let me know what you think!full review is available at blogDOTalswhartonDOTcomblog.alswharton.com/2013\u2026",

    "text": "I very much enjoyed dinner at Dinner. The food was very good, and the service was solid, but not outstanding.I had a bit of a tough time finding a starter that was appealing to me, and the lack of vegetarian options was a little frustrating. I know the Meaty Fruit is the most popular, but I can't bring myself to support that dish. That being said, the main of cod was outstanding and complemented wonderfully by the smoke artichokes -- excellent. I had the brown bread ice cream for dessert and was not at all disappointed. This was a great dinner, and atmosphere was not uptight like I thought it might be. While (unconditionally) expensive, I thought it was pretty reasonably priced.",

    "text": "Had lunch at Dinner. The name is very opportunistic, like a bad first joke to break the ice with a stranger. Despite being in the Mandarin Oriental, the furnishings and ambiance were pleasant and not pretentious.I had the Roast Bonemarrow - solid high-end fare, very savory.Meat Fruit - order it, or at least get one for the table to share. And if you're into foie gras pates, do order one for yourself as well. :)The Tipsy Cake doesn't look impressive when you first see it at that table next to yours, but don't be fooled - it's delicious, and the pineapple-sweet warm softness of it will fill you up and have you craving for more. Be sure to order it early, and order en masse, because it takes quite a while for them to make it.Brown Bread Ice Cream and Quaking Pudding were also very tasty - if you like brown sugar or caramel tastes, these would suit you well. And the Quaking Pudding does indeed quake quite threateningly! All the excuse to quickly slurp it up. :)I would come again.",

    "text": "I had high expectations for this restaurant. The evening we spent here did not disappoint.The service was just as you would expect: perfect. The waitress asked us if we had any questions about the dishes. \u00a0We gave her a few tricky questions about ingredients, but this just demonstrated how knowledgeable she was about the whole menu. \u00a0I learnt that salsify is kind of like a parsnip.There were many dishes which I wanted to try, so I took longer than usual to make up my mind. \u00a0I settled on Salamugundy for the starter. \u00a0This is a dish of chicken oysters, salsify (!), marrow bone and horseradish cream. \u00a0My wife had the roast marrowbone (with snails). \u00a0These were both very nice, but not up to the perfect standard I had set in my mind.For the main, I had the Beef Royale (special - not on the menu) which was piece of ribeye which had been cooked for 48 hours, but was still pink and tender. \u00a0You could see the marbling of fat, which gave it such a good flavour. \u00a0I took my time with this because each bit was something to savour. \u00a0My wife chose the Hereford Ribeye, which came with triple-cooked chips and mushroom ketchup. \u00a0She was also very pleased with her meal.My wife had ordered the tipsy cake right at the start, as it takes longer to prepare than the other desserts. I had some extra time to consider my choice for desert and I opted for the chocolate bar. Both of these were amazing. \u00a0The chocolate bar started with a biscuit base, then a layer of passionfruit jam topped with rich, dark chocolate. It had a quinelle of ginger ice cream on the side. I was lucky to share some of the tipsy cake: kind of a brioche pudding with a creamy sauce (a hint of alcohol) and caramelised roasted pineapple on the side. So, so very nice and I could have happily eaten two of them by myself. \u00a0We were given an additional small dessert of chocolate ganache infused with earl grey tea and a biscuit. A nice surprise indeed.We had mentioned that we may get cocktails afterwards and the waiter later offered to reserve a table for us at the bar. I was impressed by this because it showed that he had remembered and was a good personal touch. As it happened, we were satisfied enough after our desserts and decided to head home.",

    "text": "Dinner. Well, let's say lunch at Dinner. It was a special occasion, so we booked the Chef's Table. Here's a hint: If you have from four to six people and want an amazing experience, book the Chef's Table. It's much more expensive than the regular menu (\u00a3150pp for lunch, \u00a3200pp for dinner), but the experience is like none other. They offer three levels of wine pairings as well, which will add anywhere from \u00a3100pp-\u00a3500pp to the bill, but when you leave you're going to be drunk anyway, so who cares. It's also a tasting menu instead of the standard a la carte, so there's a reason to go for it. You're also sitting right next to the kitchen so you can see what they're doing. They also give have someone that's around quite a bit to explain the history of the food and fill your glasses on the way, so you feel like you're getting special service. Plus Chef Dale (one of the sous-chefs) came by to explain most of the dishes to us, and to show us the Cthulhu fruit (or as some like to call it: Buddha's Hand). So the experience is worth the money itself.What about the food? The food is pretty great as well. Like I said, it was a nine-course tasting menu which for us (as they prepare it on the day, so who knows what you're getting) consisted of tea-smoked salmon, lobster with cucumber soup, meat fruit, octopus with Cthulhu fruit, pork belly, pigeon, grilled peaches, tipsy cake, and liquid nitrogen ice cream. What a selection. All the food is prepared extremely well and looks amazing on the plate. For me there were three stand-out dishes:1) Octopus with Cthulhu fruit. That octopus was so soft and tender that you could probably cut it with a spoon. And the taste was heavenly. And if Buddha really is Cthulhu, he makes a mean citrus fruit. I was blown away by the flavors on that plate.2) Tipsy cake. The cake itself is heavenly, but the pineapple really won my heart. Apparently there's a cookbook coming out soon (or will be out by the time you've read this, who knows?) and it will have the recipe in it. I'm getting it.3) The mash. The mash is freaking amazing. It is so creamy and so soft and buttery and smooth we had to ask for more. MORE MORE MORE MASH. I even got the secrets to how it's made, and they are all mine! (Although if you go to the Chef's table, I'm sure you can find out yourself. Or maybe they'll be in the cookbook.) I will be attempting the mash at home very, very soon.Now, I bet you were expecting that I put the meat fruit in here. To be honest, it was cool. It looked like an orange, but it was pate! How very Heston! The pate was nice, but I've had better to be honest. I did enjoy the taste of the bread with it. It really complimented it.Another tip: If you're looking for triple-cooked chips, don't go in August/September. Andrew tried to order some, but they were out, and apparently they were out at the same time last year when they went. Apparently potatoes in August/September have more sugar than later in the year, so the triple-cook method creates subpar chips. So they don't make them. It was an interesting thing to know.We even got a preview of some chefs filling the molds for the meat fruit. We were sitting right around the corner, so we got to get up and stand there and watch them do it, and I learned a bit about how it's done (But I'm sure the recipe will be in the cookbook.)Oh, and if you get there early, sit in the bar and have some cocktails. They aren't cheap (at \u00a316 a drink), but they are the best cocktails I've had in London so far.For me, the chef's table at dinner was one of the best experiences and most fun I've had at a fine dining restaurant in London so far. The food here is less funky than The Fat Duck, and more historical, which makes it interesting in a completely different way. I'm not too sure I'll be back to eat again, as I got a nice selection, and the food overall didn't wow me enough like some fine dining places, but I'd come back to the bar for more of those delicious cocktails. Or maybe I'd come back with a big group and go for the private dining room. That seemed like an experience in itself as well.",

    "text": "As others have mentioned, the appeal of Dinner has been pronounced by its intro into the \"top 10\" but unfortunately it's simply just a good meal.The Knightsbridge area is very grand and the Mandarin Oriental is classic as one would expect. Our reservation time was upheld as we were even seated a bit early.The waitstaff was excellent through the entire meal however avoided eye contact through most of the serving and ordering processes. Although new to UK dining as I was only in town for a brief time, Dinner to me feels like the little kid who gets a chance to play in the big game but never expected to play so didn't bring his bat. I hope it does well for years to come but left a little bit of a yawn for this Yelper. Overall, the main dishes were good but nothing extremely memorable. The Tipsy Cake was the highlight of the occasion as it was TDF. A great wine tied everything together, however, I couldn't recommend a trip simply as I've had equal quality steak elsewhere.The meal:Rice and Flesh (Risotto w Calf's tail)Filet angusGreen BeansPork chopBraised lettuce w peasTipsy cakeGanacheS.African red wine",

    "text": "I had been looking forward to this lunch since we booked before Christmas and it delivered on all fronts. Three courses with Heston and Ashley will take you to foodie heaven, put a big smile on your face and oh so gently remove a couple of hundred pounds from your wallet. Given the acres of coverage online and in the press I don't think that there is much for me to add. If you want to keep it cheapish tap water is available and the set menu of 3 courses for \u00a328 is a bargain. If you look hard there are a few bottles of wine under \u00a340 and there is a decent selection by the glass. The meat fruit starter is just divine; a picture on the plate, it melted in the mouth and was like a lighter version of foie gras. B went for the roast scallops which came with a cucumber ketchup and borage; quite different and very tasty. We washed this down with a bottle of the white Il Cantante, Etna which was crisp, fragrant and complex - not a great fan of Simply Red but Mr Hucknall is turning out some great wine. I also had a glass of a rich robust red; the Tributo, Tejo 2008 which I would recommend very highly. Main courses and desserts were all top notch; not many people have mentioned the fish but B's roast turbot with cockle ketchup and leaf chicory was damn fine. If all cockles tasted like this I would be giving up the clam tomorrow. More bread, not made in the kitchen but bought in, was offered when we had scoffed our initial offering. Service was attentive but not over-bearing; if you enquired about a dish or a wine the staff knew their stuff and could talk at length and with insight. The room is well thought out; the tables are nicely presented and well-spaced. Wherever you are seated you will have a good view of the room, the kitchen or the park; if you are lucky you will have a combination of all three. It reminded me of one of my all time favourites: Jean Georges next to Central Park. Just one strange thing caught my eye during our lunch which I mentioned to B and she concurred with my observation. The trousers worn by the lovely lady waiting staff are just not cut right; I have never seen so much VPL in one sitting. Heston himself was buzzing about during the few hours we were there but I would think he is much too focused on the food at the moment to have given much attention to the look of his ladies front of house. Hopefully he will soon be turning his attention to these small details. We left around 5pm slightly heavy around the middle but light of heart and with a happy disposition as we made our way through the crowds down to Green Park and the short hop home. Having got this fine dining malarkey out of the way for the year I'm looking forward to getting back down to earth in New Cross tomorrow night at Meateasy .",

Just ordering random sides makes it an average steak house experience. I would have wished to get a more conceptualized food experience around the steak.Well, and then we got the desserts. Amazing.

Pellegrino list with prices proportionate to hotel owned 'celebrity chef' spots back home in Las Vegas it was with admitted skepticism that I went to Dinner and yet with flawlessly executed cuisine delivered by educated servers in a style I'd see replicated thrice more in Bray I can only say that if Heston Blumenthal ever opts to venture across the Atlantic I'll be booking reservations as soon as I can. \u00a0Obviously a unique story from his self-training to Michelin's third star it has been with a seemingly relentless focus on both the science and psychology of how we eat that Chef Blumenthal has ascended the world's ranks and while ostensibly choosing not to follow his 'mg' pedigree but rather to reinvent British history with Dinner the true beauty lies at the crux, each classic plate succeeding as a result of high quality products invigorated with modernist magic. \u00a0Offered strictly in an a la carte format with servers encouraging a traditional three-course meal it was with little regard for rules and warnings of large portions that I approached the annotated menu and eschewing alcohol in favor of several sweets it would not be long before the show began, the classic bread served at each of Heston's restaurants proving warm and irresistible with top quality butter until the creamy meat fruit arrived proving every bit deserving of its considerable praise. \u00a0Indulging in the foie gras slowly while watching the kitchen work with fervor behind a sheet of glass it would not be long before my second plate arrived and having seen the team literally inject each frog leg with butter the vegetal porridge proved a divine backdrop to otherwise unctuous aromatics, a similar effect achieved in the well-brined duck breast and offal which found an anchor in smoky fennel plus sweet gastrique. \u00a0Turning attention towards desserts after wiping clean a pot of potatoes on par with those of Robuchon it was in a trio soon to become a quartet that I invested and running the gamut from near-savory brown bread ice-cream to the bright citrus of lemon curd before culminating in boozy brioche and an after-dinner tableside show not a single bite would prove unrewarding - even the Americano delivered with a few bites plus a signed menu and well wishes for my meal at The Fat Duck just two days later.",

    "text": "Inside the beautifully historic building of the Mandarin Oriental is the restaurant Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. The restaurant is very modern which makes it quite the anti thesis to the hotel it is located in. Mandarin Oriental's facade is so grand and you are really reminded that you are in London while entering the timeless building. Once you enter the restaurant, timelessness gives way to modernity. The pretty large kitchen is separated by ceiling-to-floor glass walls and offers a view of what goes on inside. The wall of the wine cellar is also made of glass from ceiling to floor.Everyone who comes here must try the signature meat fruit which is foie gras and chicken liver encased in mandarin jelly. When presented at the table, it looks like a mandarin fruit. Slice it into half and you will see the foie gras and chicken liver inside. We ordered the meat fruit ala carte as a supplement to our prix fixe lunch. The \u00a339 3-course lunch was quite a deal given that it's a one Michelin star restaurant by Heston. The entree of dressed snails were good but having a little less dressing would allow the flavor of the snails to stand out more. My main course was the roasted quail which I enjoyed very much. The meat was absolutely tender and probably one of the most tender quails I've had. My sister and I each ordered the same entree and main choices but for dessert, we ordered one of each from the two given choices. We enjoyed the desserts, very much so. The olive oil shortbread and chocolate ganache were chocolatey enough without being too intense. The grapefruit/peach tart was a refreshing end to the meal.Solid meal, yes, but not phenomenal and by all means not mind blowing (I imagine everything of Heston to be close to mind blowing..hah!). The prix fixe lunch is a great value and if you consider the price, its one Michelin star rating, and the fact that it is a Heston Blumenthal restaurant, a visit to this place is a pretty good deal. Note that Heston is not the executive chef at this restaurant though. He is at his three Michelin star restaurant, The Fat Duck. Will I return? Probably yes, to try their ala carte menu. But I can't promise that I won't visit other Michelin rated restaurants in London before making a return visit to this place on my next trip to London.Note: My sister has been to Dinner several times over the past 4 years and according to her, the prix fixe lunch menu hasn't changed all that much.",

While there were lots of staff, everyone seemed to stay busy but relaxed, working well together. The room is well-lit with large windows that look out on Hyde park. We had noon reservations and were seated immediately. We both did the set lunch menu, which has 2 options for each course. I ordered the first option of each course and my wife ordered the second options, which meant that we could share and each try both. All our dishes were interesting and well executed. A memorable point was the octopus in our salad; it was very tender and appeared to be thin cross sections of bundles of octopus. The quail and pollock were flavorful.I felt that the set lunch menu and experience was a good value for the price.",

I say this because my husband isn't big on fine dining and he really likes this place. So much that we went a 2nd time when they opened in melbourne 2 weeks ago. So our 2nd time was last saturday with our friends from indonesia and they also love it and want to have dinner here again. Our favourite dish and probably everyone elses is the meat fruit. Don't be deceived by this dish, it's foie gras shaped and looks exactly like a real mandarin. I love the idea and the taste of it. Very smooth and silky. My husband really loves the steaks here as they cook it perfectly and it just melts in your mouth. Oh and don't forget to get dessert. yummm! The mouth watering tipsy cake is delicious. Trust me, you'll regret not ordering it. Definitely recommend this place if it's your first time fine dining to get that grwat experience.",

    "text": "I still reminisce over the \"Meat Fruit\" and Tipsy Cake that I had at Dinner. Heavenly.The dining room felt a bit stiff (probably attributable to the well-suited and glamourous diners) in my opinion but beautifully decorated indeed. I haven't had the fortune of making it to Fat Duck yet, so as Heston Blumenthal's first/only London restaurant, I was mega-excited to finally try his food. Still difficult to get a reservation a year after opening, but the hype is definitely justified.Meat Fruit needs no introduction - if you're not familiar with it, it's chicken liver pat\u00e9 masked as a mandarin orange with chargrilled bread on the side. The taste was incredibly rich and livery (don't order it if you hate the taste of livers because it's VERY prominent). The pat\u00e9 was so smooth and unlike anything I've had - definitely needs to be eaten with bread to cut the richness.I went for cured salmon with beetroot pur\u00e9e as my main because I knew I'd be stuffed from starters. It sounds like a simple dish, but when salmon is cooked right, it's insanely good. (For the record, Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley has a fantastic cured salmon starter too!) The sweetness of the beetroot pur\u00e9e went perfectly with the slightly smoky/salty salmon. When it came time to order desserts, Tipsy Cake was a no-brainer for me. Come on, booze + brioche bun + cream? Not to mention the SPIT-ROAST PINEAPPLE that the waiter kept pointing towards throughout the meal, and telling us how good it is? Winning combination for me! The dessert is definitely boozy, but in a good way, and not overpowering. Indulgence at its best, and when you have it with the caramelised pineapple...truly heavenly. You also get a earl grey mousse with shortbread as a finish to the meal, but I found it too much after the Tipsy Cake. Nevertheless, well-deserved 5-stars from me. I need to get my hands on the Tipsy Cake recipe to fill the void in my life!",

    "text": "In a word? Underwhelming. Been to a handful of 2 and 3 Michelin star places and DbHB is easily the worst of the bunch. Not bad by any stretch but also nothing special, at least on my visit. Let's start from the top...When we arrived (and this may be part of the problem we had late reservation at 10:30) we we about 4 minutes early (does that even count?). The hostess immediately said \"well you're early so you'll have to wait\". I asked how long and she responded \"I can't tell you how many MINUTES, have a drink in the bar please\". Just weird. She really set the tone which was just kind of off. Again she wasn't overly rude just kind of standoffish. Part of the fun of trying restaurants is seeing how they balance the people vibe. Some are robotically formal and you marvel at their precision (Per Se) some are tiny and very informal but also precise (Jiro), so I am not criticizing that I found the service a little informal and \"steakhouse-y\" but that the precision expected when a restaurant is supposed to be one of the best in the world was totally lacking. We only sat at the bar long enough to order our drinks then were whisked off to our table. Again, better coordination would have avoided the awkwardness. We now ended up starting what was already a late meal with two full cocktails which meant we sat for 20m finishing those with staff kind of buzzing around wanting to get started (truth be told so did we, we probably should have turfed the drinks but again, just weird, it was they who threw the timing off which again is not the sign of greatness. Once seated menu explanation and the usual pre order banter was great. The sommelier arrived which is where things went downhill. I generally like to ask the Sommelier to pair by course since I've had so many good experiences doing that in the past. For some reason this sommelier read my desire for her to pair to mean that I didn't want to drink more than a glass or two. I enjoy being put in the hands of a competent sommelier but she wasn't getting it so I simply asked her for a recommendation. Again totally tone deaf to what I was looking for. I don't fault the restaurant for this, maybe their wines by the glass aren't suitable for a full meal pairing, but a sign of a great restaurant is partly how well they anticipate and respond to diners and this is far from an unusual request and it was met with complete incomprehension. The rest of the pace of the meal was totally off. We received bread with cocktails still on the table. Didn't get wine until after had started nibbling on bread and our first course arrived about 30s after we received wine and about 2m after the bread. They had to arrange the table like it was an Appleby's to get everything on the table it was just sloppy and felt like they were trying to rush is out. The Meat Fruit is as incredible as everyone says it is, a feast for the eyes and for fans of chicken liver pate the creamiest and redolent of monkfish liver more than chicken liver it's so strong (in a good way). Super yummy and probably the highlight of the meal. However the savoury porridge and frogs legs was a total disappointment. I'd say this dish is actively bad. First off it was lukewarm from the first bite and completely cold by the time we finished. Totally unacceptable but I was in no mood to be sending food back. The frogs legs are panko fried little bits of tasteless nothing, and the green porridge has bits of red beet that when mixed with the porridge turn the whole dish grey. Honestly pretty gross. Cold, tasteless and grey. No thanks. The next course was better timed we had a moment to breathe and I was feeling hopeful. The Iberico pork chop was very good as far as pork chops go, but wasn't making my eyes roll back in my head. It was tasty and warm. I've had better pork chops at home though. My wife's lamb was similar boring. Well prepared and competent preparation but felt like decent home cooking not one of the best restaurants in the world. The sweetbreads on the side were again these little panko breaded tasteless bits, don't know what's up with that. The veg sides are worth describing though, they were the highlight of the meal. Not sure how they prepare the carrots but man, they were amazing. Lightly spiced, still firm with a subtle meaty flavour. Yum. Same thing with the mashed potatoes. Verging on being like soft cheese they were velvety and tasted of fresh cream. Seriously give the veg guy a promotion. We ended with the also worth the hype Tipsy Cake which is like farmhouse buns bathed in butter, booze (Sauternes?) vanilla and sugar with a side of roasted pineapple. My wife went to the bathroom 30s before it arrived and they just left it there for 5m. It was plenty warm when she got back but again, weird for a Michelin star place to be so sloppy. The fresh made ice cream is likewise a fun and surprising end to a meal. Decent, but won't be back :(",

Words can't explain how delicious they were. I loved that these dishes were very original and historically English. I didn't think it was too pricey at all. The only thing I wish I had done differently was come early and had a cocktail or two at the bar. I saw some of the craft cocktails and I am so bummed that I wasn't able to order any. This restaurant is definitely deserving of the accolades.",

It's was surprisingly easy to get a reservation 2 days in advance although it probably helped it was during the week and on the earlier side.While it's billed as being a casual atmosphere, it's casual for a European Michelin restaurant not casual like Michelin restaurants in California are. Suits aren't required and there was almost no ties on the diners but the servers were all wearing either suits or waistcoats and dress pants. The decor is formal in a modern way like Eleven Madison Park. I think I may have been the first table sat but it filled up as the 2 hours I was there passed but never got anywhere close to full. Since I was solo dining I decided to stickl to the appetizers and a dessert rather than having a main course. I had three appetizers and one dessert so the cost was comparable to have a 3 course meal. Expect to pay 100 USD per person without drinks. The service was the best I had in service deprived London. The servers were knowledgeable about the dishes, able to answer questions, offer suggestions but weren't omnipresent.I had the meat fruit, the Salamugundy, Chicken oysters, salsify, marrow bone & horseradish cream \u00a0and the Frumenty, Grilled octopus, smoked sea broth, pickled dulse & lovage. The Frumenty was by far my favorite, it tasted as if I was eating the essence of the sea and the octopus was as good as any I had in Barcelona. It was so tender even though it was large pieces. The Meat Fruit which is his famous pate in the shape of an orange was very good but the look was more impressive than the pate. Of course it was probably some of the best duck liver pate I've had. The salamugundy was my least favorite, the chicken was rather bland and everything else on the plate tasted better than it. But still not a single dish would I ever reject if offered again.I appreciated that they were able to run my bill in USD so I didn't have to pay any transaction fee and it was a much better rate than what my bank would have charged. The restaurant appeared to be wheelchair accessible but the bathrooms were down a flight of stair and did not appear to be accessible.It completely met up with my expectation and I would gladly go back.",

Maybe a slight delay in getting the mains to us, but there was so much to look at, great people watching and peering over at what others were eating. Historical British recipes reinterpreted for modern diners. I swear the waiters and waitresses could read my mind and body language - I didn't have to ask for anything or where the bathroom was.I went to dinner with a girl friend and we had all 3 courses - starting with the recognizable meat fruit (foie gras inside a gelatin mandarin with toast) - subtle mandarin flavour, delicious chicken pate. Roast Marrowbone with escargots - perfect texture, not gummy at all. Mains - Angus fillet - despite my friend having it cooked medium well, it was tender and had a beautiful flavour. Turbot in cider - really juicy fish cooked warm so it retained flavour. Desserts - I didn't really like the brown bread ice cream (it tasted like sourdough ice cream, no sugar) but the salted butter caramel and perry poached pear cubes were a surprisngly delicious combination. The chocolate bar with passion fruit jam and ginger ice cream was also a delicious combination.Don't even hesitate, just go.",

    "text": "Wowzers Heston, I think you just whisked me away to food heaven... Having managed to secure my lunchtime table just the day before (what a coo!) I struggled to contain my excitement for 24 hours, while spending the time perusing the menu wondering how I was ever going to make a decision. We arrived at the Mandarin Oriental (London's most expensive hotel) and found our way to the restaurant at the back. We were seated at a table that looked straight into the open plan kitchen from one side and over Hyde Park from the other, what an exceptional setting. It was a battle of heart versus head in deciding whether to stick with the exceptionally well priced set lunch menu (\u00a328 for three courses) or to go al la carte for the much more varied but ever so slightly more expensive menu. Of course, in true foodie fashion, we went off piste and went for the al la carte (well, we will probably only eat here once!). After a gin and tonic aperitif , the wine list came and we gawped at the exceptional prices. \u00a314,000 for one bottle of wine, who does that?? The wine list does favour those with a fuller wallet but we unashamedly plumped for the only bottle of house red at \u00a339, and it was good. Starters came - the signature dish of meat fruits for myself and the bone marrow for my dining companion. The meat fruits is presented beautifully so that it appears as a mandarin on the plate, the whole thing being edible. The flavour was delightful, rich and creamy. For main course I went for the roast turbot with cockle ketchup. This really captured the tastes and textures of the sea and was very good. I also got to try a mouthful of the Blackfoot pork chop which had fantastic flavour. We had both ordered a side of fries and asked politely if they could substitute the ordinary fries for Heston's famous triple cooked chips which they were kind enough to do. Oh my, who would have thought that an ordinary potato could taste so good! I highly recommend that you request the swap if you go. For pudding I had to go for the Tipsy cake, which I was required to pre-order at the start of the meal. Probably my entire daily calories in one dish, but as with all things immensely fattening, it tasted amazing! This dish is also served with the spit-roast pineapple that you can see cooking when you enter the restaurant. Next came the tea menu. As as bit of a tea monster, and someone who doesn't drink coffee, it was refreshing to see a menu that focused more on tea than coffee and I plumped for the silver needle white tea - subtle flavours but tasty and refreshing. This was served alongside an extra pudding - a white chocolate ganache served with a salted caramel biscuit. I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of this as it tasty weirdly of cheese. Now, I love cheese, but my chocolate should never taste of cheese! The service was exceptional and the whole dining experience was a delight. Yes, it was pricey but we could have done it cheaper if we had chosen to. Top marks Heston, another great success.",

    "text": "Dinner by Heston is one of the most esteemed London restaurants, run by arguably Britain's most famous chef. It's located inside of the Mandarin Oriental in Knightsbridge, and while the d\u00e9cor was a little old school for my tastes, our table had a great view overlooking Hyde Park. I was actually surprised to find out that the restaurant is a la carte and not a tasting menu. After consulting with our server, we decided on the meat fruit, rice and flesh, and salamagundy for starters, and the powdered duck breast, roast Iberico pork chop, and chicken cooked with lettuce for the mains. The meat fruit lived up to all the hype; it is one of Heston's most famous dishes and the orange gel paired really well with the richness of the chicken liver parfait. We briefly considered ordering two of these, but one between three people turned out to be the perfect amount. Both the rice and flesh and salamagundy were good but not particularly memorable - if you are curious, chicken oysters are a fatty part of the chicken on the back of the leg that gets no exercise, thus it has the texture resembling that of an oyster. We also got the chips to try the mushroom ketchup, and for some reason I didn't really taste the whole mushroom thing. As for the mains, the duck was served very rare, but was very enjoyable; the chicken tasted like concentrated essence of chicken - that's the best I can describe it, but it came highly recommended and is far from your ordinary chicken; and the pork was very nice as well. For dessert we got the tipsy cake and the spring tart - the tipsy cake was great and the pineapple was just the right touch; the spring tart was ok but I wouldn't be dying to have that again. We saw nitrogen ice cream being made at nearby tables, but were told there is a minimum spend so that you can't just get one of them. Overall, I enjoyed the dining experience and was indeed impressed by Heston's most well-known dishes. I can see why people come here, but also see how it might be best enjoyed on an expense account!",

    "text": "Dinner at Heston B lived up to its high expectations. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, the service was amazing. We felt so welcome. Every staff person we walked by (and there are lots of staff) greeted us warmly.The sommelier was tremendously helpful, and took a ton of time to describe different wines to us, and help us find the perfect wine to match our tastes. This was in stark contrast to the really rushed (almost bordering on rude) service we got two nights ago from the sommelier at Joel Robuchon in Paris.We ended up selecting a delicious 2009 Bordeaux from Duluc de Branaire-Ducru from Saint Julien in the Loire Valley.Then, our head waiter came and we asked him for his recommendations. He spent almost 10 minutes with us, describing his favorite dishes in mouth-watering detail, where the food was sourced from, how the dishes were prepared. It was amazing. My wife and I were even more impressed with the restaurant's attentive and amazingly friendly service.The service wan't stuffy at all. Everyone was cracking jokes, and being super friendly.Here's a breakdown of our meal:1) White and sourdough bread - really really good. Like Fat Duck good. The bread crust was wonderfully crispy, and the center moist and delicious. I could almost pick up a faint aroma of coffee grounds in the crust.2) Meat Fruit - truly amazing. Chicken liver pate hidden in the faux gelatin shell of a mandarin orange. When served, it looks like you're being presented with a clementine orange and a toast point. However, the minute you cut into the fruit, you know you're in for a different kind of an experience. The citrus of the fruit exterior perfectly complemented the fattiness of the chicken liver3) Frumenty - Grilled octopus with smoked sea broth, pickled dulse and lovage. This was a really, really solid starter. The smokiness of the broth was amazing and the octopus was really tender4) Chicken cooked with lettuces, served with grilled onion emulsion, spiced celeriac sauce and oyster leaves - second best chicken dish I ever had, after Chateaubriand in Paris. Chicken was so fragrant and tender. Nearly melt in your mouth good5) Roast Iberico Pork Chop served with pointy cabbage, onions, and Robert sauce. The pork was prepared a perfect medium rare. It is nearly impossible to find pork cooked this well anywhere. Usually, in my experience, pork ends up getting overcooked. This particular pork comes from a pig that is allowed to roam in its own private acre of land, foraging naturally on acorns. Basically, it's living the high life, until, of course, it's slaughtered and turned into an amazing dish at Heston B6) A side of triple fried chips. Really yummy, especially after dipping into the chicken soup7) Tipsy Cake - the dessert that these guys are famous for. Spit roasted pineapple served with a brioche cake. Wow, just wow. I don't usually like desserts, but this one is magnificent. The cake is creamy, delicious, and pairs perfectly with the roasted pineapple8) Sambocade - Goats milk cheesecake with elderflower and apple, perry poached pear, and smoked candied walnuts. Another solid dessert. The apple inside the cheesecake nicely cuts the sharpness of the goat cheese9) Chocolate ganache infused with earl gray, and a fennel seed cracker",

    "text": "Meat fruit!I was traveling to London on a business trip and researching good restaurants to eat at. I was a bit hesitant to make the booking at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal because their 72 hour cancelation fee was 50 pounds per person. Yikes! However, I saw that the 6:30 pm reservation was the only one available for the next 1.5 months, so I knew I had to jump on it. My colleague and I showed up about 20 minutes early and were escorted to our table by the window. Since it was summer in London and the sun doesn't set until 9:30 pm, we had a nice view of Hyde Park for the entire meal. We ordered the meat fruit and octopus appetizers to share, and I ordered the duck entree and my colleague ordered the pork chop. All of the dishes had beautiful presentation and were perfectly executed. When the meat fruit came, I was so in awe at how much it looked like an orange that I wanted to poke it with my finger just to make sure it wasn't an orange. For dessert, we ordered the tipsy cake to share. They kept mentioning a spit-roasted pineapple so I expected a full pineapple (and there was a photo of a pineapple behind the reception area), but it was just a little slice. We also saw the ice cream trolley, but sadly I was too full to eat another dessert.I liked how their portions were reasonably sized so one person could easily consume both an appetizer and an entree. They also had great service and were very attentive without being too overbearing. Definitely coming back next time I'm in London!",

    "text": "Believe me, I took great thought about this and it pains me to give this a 3 star, mostly because I was super excited to try this restaurant, heard about it, read about it and booked a reservation months ahead to try one of the world's best restaurants. Not that this was not good, but it was just that, an ok, a good, not extraordinary in anyway. Had I not had this high expectation of Heston, probably this review will go up to 4-star. Even during the dinner, I was trying to convince myself that this was astounding, but after several attempt, I stopped fooling myself and boldly face the reality. Tried the meat fruit, delicious and creamy, but it was just exactly that. Single dimensional taste, the texture was great but after couple of bites, you left feeling wanting to gulp 3 gallons of water just because it was so heavy. But don't get me wrong, it was delicious. \u00a0For entree, tried the duck breast. Ironically, that same morning I tried duck and waffle and I can't stop my head from comparing this duck to that delicious fried duck. As alluded, after several mind battle to convince myself this was better, I succumbed and admitted that freaking 15pound duck at Duck & Waffle was superior.Tried the tipsy cake too, it was nice and more on the overly sweet side. Also, it was unfortunate that there was only one amuse bouche, maybe I was spoiled, but wasn't it supposed to be more than 1, at least a couple of single-bite dish on one plate or whatever? It was a let down too. Nevertheless, one high point was the service. Very attentive, professional, charming and dedicated. I just wish the food was as good as the service *loud sigh*",

    "text": "I came here with a couple of friends for the \u00a338 set lunch menu, but I mistakenly booked lunch for a sunday when the menu wasn't available. As the booking service charges \u00a350 for a missed reservation, we just decided to go here for the normal menu anyway. We walked into the hotel and were greeted immediately by the hostess who knew our reservation by name. She walked us to our table, and our server came soon after to give us our menus. Though I was hesitant to get the braised celery dish, the outstanding yelp reviews convinced me to get it anyway. I also got the tipsy cake and a side of chips thanks to other reviewers. Note: the tipsy cake needs to be ordered with the main course as it takes a long time to make!While we waited for our food, we got two types of bread (white, brown) with plenty of butter. They also brought out more bread as we kept finishing all the bread in front of us. When the food came out I was a bit taken aback by how pretty the dish was! It was absolutely stunning. I was also not disappointed at all by the lack of meat in the dish. The braised celery was much more filling, tasty, and savory than I expected it to be. Shortly after we finished eating, our desserts came out together and they were also really beautiful. The tipsy cake is an absolute MUST when dining at Dinner. The cake was delightfully soft and the sauce sweet but not overpowering. The pineapple on the side was also a good balance for the cake. Overall, a wonderful dining experience with great service and food. It's no wonder it has 2 michelin stars and the ranking of #5 best restaurant in the world - absolutely well deserved!",

So, you should get online and make a booking.The standout was not necessarily the food, which was pretty good, but the service. They seemed to find the perfect balance between attentiveness and privacy. The setting is also very nice - a view over Hyde Park in Summer can't be beaten. The food was pretty good, but I was disappointed that I missed out on Heston's triple cooked chips - I understand it was something to do with the non-availability of a certain potato - but everything else was very good (and to go back to my original point, better than expected because the prices, in Australian terms, were so reasonable). The highlight, food wise, was the Meat-Fruit. Wow. So clever. And so many levels of taste. The other highlight was the Brown Bread Ice-Cream, which worked spectacularly. It tasted like... home. Back when I was 7 years old, and mum would make comforting desserts for the whole family.",

I requested a table next to the windows so I could gaze at Hyde Park.In a completely empty restaurant I was seated several tables over from the window. When I mentioned this to staff they informed me others had reserved every table near the window and we couldn't be moved.45 minutes went by with nobody sitting there---I asked again and was moved.Thanks for the awkward table change mid meal.The food was meh. I ordered the cod in cider. The cod was tender yet flavorless. It desperately needed that cider. It was also so tender that it had me slightly worried that it may not be cooked all the way through.My guest ordered the braised celery which was good but a very small portion compared to the cod.Yes, I ordered the meat fruit. No- I wasn't amazed by it.The bread was too hard.The pineapple tipsy cake was the stand out item on the menu if you must know.It's a damn shame I couldn't just order than upon walking in....who's to say you can't though?Maybe there will be a second time.",

Definitely go for the Meat Fruit, which is a pate disguised as a Mandarin orange, it's rich and rife for instagram opportunities. Every single main is amazing, I cannot stress this enough (or at least those that I tried). Your meal should end off with their Tipsy Cake for dessert (and you MUST have their dessert), which is a pineapple on spit roast with some cake thrown in and a marvelous innovation by Chef Heston. If you want to pick one fine dining place to eat in London, this is it. Book early to avoid disappointment.",
