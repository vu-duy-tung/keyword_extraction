    "text": "One of the things on my list to do during my recent vacation to London was a traditional English tea. However, as London is much more expensive than I anticipated it to be, and I'm from NYC, I soon realized that a traditional high tea at a hotel was out of my budget. Tea & Tattle, while very cute, isn't what I had in mind. However, I was very happy with me decison to come here. The portion sizes were great! By the time we were done with our sandwiches & scones we had to ask for the huge piece of cake to be wrapped so we could take it home and eat it later. If you're looking to do a tea in London and don't want to spend upwards of $100 at a hotel, this is a great alternative.",

    "text": "Tea and Tattle is a charming tea shop located right across the British Museum. Definitely pay a visit here if you are ever in the area! The tea menu included a good variety of teas. A few that caught my eye were the Kenyan Fannings, Darjeeling, Lapsang, and Ceylon, because I wasn't too familiar with the flavor characteristics of these. In the end, I opted for the Ceylon tea. Turns out Ceylon is an aromatic bold black tea.The scones were delicious, although it was on the smaller side. The clotted cream and jam were pre-applied, but they definitely didn't skimp. The damson jam was delicious by the way. I would also like to point out the interesting mix of wall decor. One side of the wall was dominated by an Oriental themed wall paper, while the rest were spotted with Yue Minjun prints, Chinese propaganda posters, and antique Victorian prints. Very interesting...",

For tea we had assam and darjeeling, served with their lovely tea cup sets. I ordered the crab & avocado sandwich and my friend the chicken and cucumber one. I'd say hers is much better, although mine is the most pricy one on the sandwich menu. My favorite has to be the lovely scones. They are not as small as I once read in a review. Normal size, with lovely jam. I loved my strawberry & black pepper jam, and my friend's Damson jam one is not bad either. The cake slice for me is very big. I wasn't really expecting such a big slice. I loved the coffee and walnut one, but my friend said her chocolate one is a bit too sweet. They also served us sweet cool lemonade, which I didn't know was part of the set menu.Overall, I'm very happy with the afternoon tea I had. I think it's well worth the price.The service is good as well. The waiter was very friendly. It's somewhere I can go many more times.",

The traditional tea set menus have a pretty standard price of \u00a315, including tea, cake, sandwiches and scones. I had the scone and tea special offer for \u00a35.90, with raspberry and vanilla jam (very delicious) and Ceylon tea. The only flaw was the scones were on the small side.

I ordered the afternoon tea which included your choice of sandwich, dessert, scone and tea. I elected to have the ploughman sandwich with a slice of lemon drizzle cake, scone and Earl Grey tea. Whew, that's a ton of food at an excellent price at only \u00a310! I don't think I've ever paid such a great price for afternoon tea anywhere.The sandwich was DELICIOUS! Nothing much to it, but the cheese and chutney was wonderful. The scone was smothered in clotted cream and jam the way I like it. The lemon drizzle cake was just ok, but at that point, I was so full. The waitstaff was so friendly and very attentive. I didn't expect such a great place so close to a large tourist attraction. As an added bonus, the dishware was very elegant which enhanced the experience of having proper tea. As far as ambiance is concerned, very nice and purposely decorated. From what I saw, the coffee menu was quite extensive with a good selection of baked treats like cupcakes, albeit I was too full to have one of those. I recommend this place to anyone who would like to escape the long lines at the museum and have a great meal.",

The tea room was cute, and location was great as it's right by the British museum, but the tea selection was simple, and the scone (singular) was really tiny. The scone came toasted, and with cream + jam. You get a choice of several different jam, and the cream was nice and thick, but there was a little too much jam for my taste. All in all, it wasn't bad, but I would definitely not go out of my way to get tea there. There are a lot of places that serve better scones and tea at comparable prices.",

In other words, if you're on a low-carb diet, stay far, far away. Everyone else: hurry in.I would recommend everything I ordered: Darjeeling tea, the chicken sandwich with lemon mayo and cucumber on rosemary bread, strawberry-pepper jam on scones with clotted cream, and carrot cake. It was the perfect fuel for a late afternoon at the British Museum, 'cause god knows you don't want to see the Rosetta Stone on an empty stomach.Props to good service here. At one point I eavesdropped on the conversations of my few fellow diners (this place only seats about 15) and realized we were all American. The friendly lady serving us didn't seem phased by our lack of knowledge of this great gustatory tradition.Book ahead of time, or be prepared to wait a bit in the African bookstore upstairs. I think we waited about 10 minutes (we didn't have a reservation and came in at around 4:00), though it was totally worth it.",

I wanted to sit down for some tea after visiting the British Museum (which was pretty exhausting, not gonna lie) and saw this place across the street. It looked cute enough from the outside (my judgement criteria...) so I went in. At first I was confused because I saw a cashier and a bookstore behind him, so I thought I might have walked into the wrong door. But then I figured out that the actual tea place (for sit-in) was downstairs so I wandered down there and was seated at this cute little table in a cozy corner. I was given a menu and even though they had lots of options I'm a lover of green tea so it was definitely Sencha Tea for me.Within 5 minutes the tea came out in the CUTEST teapot and the most gorgeous teacup. And oh my goodness, the tea! The sencha tea was the best green tea (and probably tea, in general) I've ever had - it was SO incredibly fresh and authentic, and it tasted beautiful (I think that's the first time I've ever used \"beautiful\" to describe taste). But it's true. Everything about this place is great: the service, the atmosphere, and - most of all - the tea. I absolutely loved my experience here.Next time (yes there will definitely be a next time) I'm for sure trying the afternoon tea menu! The person next to me got it and it looked delicious.",

All of the tables and chairs seem to be shoved up against walls in hallways and such so that both times I've gone I feel like I have the worst table in the place....and then realize it seems they are all the worst tables in the house. The tea, scones and sandwiches were fine but I'd say the dessert was below par. I would not avoid it but neither would I seek it out.",

The price range on the tea for two is just right. \u00a0We looked at so many places for tea and they all were so expensive. \u00a0Thankfully that was not the case with Tea & Tattle.We ordered the Cream Cheese, Chives and Cucumber and Mature Cheddar with Westmorland Chutney sandwiches, the Coffee and Walnut and Victoria sponge cake and the scones. \u00a0Everything was fantastic. \u00a0Unlike some of the afternoon teas that we had, this one was the perfect sized meal. \u00a0And when you're there with two people, it's also great for sharing. \u00a0The scones were perfect, not too dry. \u00a0I liked the amount of clotted cream that they put on them. \u00a0The mismatched china works so well with the entire place. \u00a0If we lived locally, I know we would go here ALL THE TIME.The only complaint was there seemed to be an issue with the bathrooms and they smelled AWFUL. \u00a0Other than that, everything was perfect.",

I did my homework and knew that going to one of the hotels or fancy tea houses was going to prove expensive. I got the London Pass and in the booklet i found that they offered a discount to the Tea and Tattle. I was impressed. it was a little place in a bookstore (i was in heaven!) and the staff could not be more accomodating. it was just perfect. a little on the small side, but thats what gives it it's charm. Now to the food. I had the Tea for one. The tea was amazing. i went traditional and had a pot of the Earl Grey. I had the Tuna and Cucumber sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and rasberry jam. The servings were awesome. so much so that i had to have the slice of chocolate cake as a takeaway.",

I had the afternoon tea service menu with the Assam tea, roast beef and watercress sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and strawberry & black pepper jam, and the lemon drizzle cake. It also came with homemade lemonade. Food was delicious and very filling. The lemon drizzle cake was a little too sweet for my taste as it had sugar crystals on top of it.

I suppose it could be described as quintessentially English; with wonderful old pictures of past times on the walls, nice wooded tables and chairs. It isn't enormous, but will accommodate a good 10 - 12 people at a time. \u00a0So we sat at our little table, I ordered a scone with cream with raspberry and vanilla jam and an Americano coffee. \u00a0My wife had some gluten free chicken, cucumber, and lemon mayonnaise chutney sandwiches and a pot of earl grey tea. \u00a0Both were a wonderful light meal after our trek around the museum. \u00a0Prices are, as you'd expect \"London heavy\" but worth the whole atmosphere and ambiance of this spot, well worth a visit after going to the museum.",

You will enjoy it here, but first thing first, call to make a reservation. \u00a0The shop is actually in the basement of a book store. \u00a0The book store is 4th generation operated and the shop has been opened since 2010. \u00a0The wallpaper mural is absolutely beautiful. \u00a0The entire shop seats less than 10 tables, I believe. \u00a0The staff is super friendly and nice. \u00a0We had the traditional tea and everything was wonderful except for the cake. \u00a0We had the chocolate cake and the chocolate walnut cake; chocolate cake didn't have enough chocolate flavor and walnut cake was dry. \u00a0I didn't ask to substitute the cake with more scones, which were delicious, but I am not sure if they allow substitution anyways. Another great thing? \u00a0It's right across from the British Museum! (If you can't make a reservation for Tea & Tattle, they actually serve afternoon tea inside the British Museum, too. \u00a0;) )",

    "text": "I hate scones, I really do. They are dry and thick with dried pieces of fruit lodged into it. But tea and tattle deviates from the sad usual and produces scrumptious \u00a0scones. Is it because they pronounce it differently over here? Or is it their jam? Either way, their jam is goodness in a jar so I purchased it right away when I saw them on the shelf. With the scones, I guess I'll never know why they are so good. My tea sandwich was also good w an impressive onion marmalade. Great food, average ambiance, average service.",

My friends and I always get the tea + scones combo and it's definitely a favorite. Fresh scones, and absolutely delicious jam (i'm pretty sure they make it themselves?). The tea is always perfectly brewed when it gets to you unlike some other tea rooms i've gone too. And there's always a friendly face when I walk in. Whoever owns this place is doing a great job.",

At \u00a317.50 for a full afternoon tea, it's pretty reasonable, especially for the quality of food and service.Small-ish venue, v friendly and knowledgeable people working here, v tasty sandwiches, delightful and fluffy scones -with superb jams- and great (taste wise and size wise) cakes! On top of that, you get a v nice pot of your tea of choice as well as a glass of homemade lemonade with your afternoon tea. Make sure you book, otherwise you will not get a table, but even if you are a bit last minute, they will do their best to accommodate you! \u00a0I have been there a few times, and I love taking friends there so we can enjoy a nice chat in nice surroundings.",

Tea and Tattle is perfect. \u00a0I ordered a pot of Assam and they served it perfectly hot, very full, and with milk on the side. \u00a0The scones with clotted cream were a bit warm in the middle and perfectly balanced between moist and dry (in terms of sweetness not crumbly). The raspberry and vanilla preserves were, another reviewer suggested, the most delicious I could imagine on these heavenly bites. \u00a0For my cake, I choose the coffee and walnut cake. The slice was generous. The sweetness of the frosting complemented the coffee flavor of the cake. The frosting was neither too little or too much. \u00a0I strongly suggest that for afternoon tea, skip the Museum options across the street and come spend your money at this great bookstore (with wonderful gifts for friends back home). The tables in the tea room have plugs near by if you want to charge your phone (bring an adapter if necessary). \u00a0The staff was thoroughly friendly and gracious. \u00a0Tea and Tattle may have provided me my favorite quintessential English experience yet!",

It's right across the street so I was worried that it would be so busy and that I wouldn't get a table without a reservation. To my surprise, they were able to seat my party of 4 even though they were a bit on the busy side. There are about 4 rooms with tables, the decor is very soft and delicate. The staff was a little overwhelmed because they were busy, but that's understandable. The tea and desserts were wonderful and for about 3-4 pounds everything was so decently priced. My favorite was the coffee walnut cake! Wow was that amazing. If you're in the area and are craving a good cup of tea, quiet and calm ambiance and tasty sweets then definitely stop in!",
