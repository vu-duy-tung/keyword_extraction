    "text": "I love Kulu Kulu. It seems like a Japanese 'caff' as it looks a bit grubby. Sometimes there's a queue to be seated, especially early Friday nights and Saturday lunchtimes. Beware, it is closed on Sundays. However, all these factors just point to how formidable the food is. This sushi, prepared in front of you and delivered by conveyor belt, comes with no gimmicks, so taking a sushi novice there is a bit tough at first. There is a great selection of dishes, and the portions are really big compared to chain competitors' dismal offerings. There is a great sense that the food is fresh and the authenticity of the place as a real Japanese joint is not only bolstered by the presence of Japanese customers, but by the drink-all-you-can green tea. I've been about 15 times in the past year, it's probably the best place in Soho to meet someone before going to the cinema, or for a quick meal after work. You eat as much as you want (providing you can accommodate the low prices as emblazoned on colour co-ordinated plates on the walls), for as long as you want, and the staff are very adept at arranging bills separately so there's none of that 'well I ate this and you ate that so that means you owe this and you owe that' nonsense that always seems to tarnish a meal, if not a friendship. It's also a great place to go on your own, especially if you happen to have friends who are embarrassingly bad with chopsticks, or don't understand the delights of tubs of pickled ginger and wasabi, or a condiment called 'Bull-Dog' sauce. That said, it's not so great nearer to closing time with a big group of people. I did this recently and the food selection wasn't that great (no soy aubergine! no katsu chicken! no potato salad!?) and the staff took a while to split a bill between 6 people including a couple of bottles of wine. They took it in good spirit when my friend started taping their tips to the tip bowl, though. They are also great at helping you sort out a takeaway, letting you grab plates of food which they wrap up for you.",

If you know your sushi and sashimi, then this place easily out-does fancier joints like Yo-Sushi simply because their ingredients seem fresher: the ginger is more moist and the wasabi is less flaky. Add in the 'cute' factor of everyone sitting around the small conveyor belt, encouraging conversation, the free green tea and the relatively good value compared to the larger chains, you couldn't really wish for a more authentic or bustling sushi experience - just remember to help yourself.",

There is a wide variety of dishes on the conveyerbelt from a delicious cooked aubergine plate, to oysters, scallop nigiri and then more ordinary items such as salmon nigiri. Like Yo Sushi, plates are priced based on patterns, although Yo Sushi has a simpler colour scheme. It's self service with free Green tea and you have little boxes dotted around the seating area with soy sauce, wasabi, ginger and chopsticks. You do sometimes have to queue for a seat but once you sit down, you can be in and out very quickly; it's up to you how fast really. I ended up with a stack of plates by my side, and was in and out, about \u00a317 down, within about 20 minutes but satisfied and full.",

Everything tastes fresh and delicious and they charge according to the saucer you get - prices go from \u00a31,20 up to \u00a33,60. At the end there was a pile of them!

I could live on these hand rolls especially the soft shell crab ones. They are definitely worth the wait as they are made fresh. My word of caution is you really don't have to greedy grab here as the portions are quite generous say compared to Yo Sushi, so sit back, relax a watch beautiful sushi move before your eyes.",

But it's worth it. I have been told 'Kulu Kulu' actually means something that goes around... which is exactly what the food does :D The dishes are continually placed on a conveyor belt as it is prepared so you just help yourself. The price of each dish is determined by the colour of the plate, that are displayed on the wall, so you know exactly what you have to pay. The staff is polite and helpful: if you want a dish in particular, let them know and they will prepare it for you. The food is fresh, delicious and good value for money, especially when compared to larger chains like Yo Sushi and has a large selection of authentically Japanese dishes: maki, sashimi, seaweed, fried aubergines, miso soup, etc. Green tea is also available at will :)",

There was a large predominance of salmon that night (Saturday around 20:30) and people were starting to leave so it didn't get replenished as much, or with much variety. That was a shame. Decor is nothing to speak of, as there is none, but the conveyor belt's mesmerising dance of colourful sushi was plenty to keep my eyes busy. Will definitely be going back. The best place is in the back, against the wall right next to the kitchen as you can then grab the freshest dishes as soon as they're put down!",

    "text": "I wanted to meet a friend in town, and I knew we had limited time. Scrolling my food list I realised I had never been Kulu Kulu. Ahhh...a conveyor belt sushi place. Now I know why. But I thought why not. I had been to some amazing places for sushi in Japan and amongst them was a conveyor belt place in Tokyo. Now in Tokyo we used ipads to order straight to our seating. So it wasn't necessarily conveyor belt but customised/automated whatever you want to call it, to order.Kulu Kula has roaming plates created in the center by sushi chefs. The one in Brewer St has non Japanese chefs. I'm always sceptical about this but in my old age have realised that it doesn't mean they can't cut, slice or on a wider scale do the food that is not instantly recognisable with them.Some of the food I had:PROS:- I saw an Unagi nigiri! I had to get it and it was marinaded beautifully. Good start. - The prawn Torpedo Roll was perfect. Hitting the spot with it's mayo, rice and prawn.- The aubergine miso. So soft and not too sharp. I've cooked this at home and this was balanced well.CONS:- The shrimp and the pork salad I spotted and just grabbed were OK. Nothing to shout about really.This place is a quick stop off for lunch, though I'd be tempted to come back for Dinner if in a hurry and also for the novelty factor. As it was fun spotting plates and asking the chefs in the middle. They price the food by the style of the plates which is clever. It can add up but on the whole it was very reasonable with dishes from \u00a32-\u00a34 approx. A nice alternative to the long stay, fancy places you might find for Japanese food in town for sure.",

    "text": "Really disappointed and feeling unsatisfied. Kulu Kulu was once my go-to sushi restaurant, if I wanted something quick and easy, no nonsense Japanese food, Kulu Kulu was it. I really like the whole conveyor belt idea, the quick served up ramen, and the noodle soup. The restaurant it self is small and I find it cosy, you watch the chef as he prepares the dishes. It reminded me a little bit of Tokyo. However tonight, I notice the menu had changed slightly and not for the better. Portions seems slight bigger and there were less seafood choices.Smoked salmon was served on with some of the rolls, and what made me clinch my fist and bite my bottom lip was that, salmon still had its trimmings. There is NO EXCUSE. If you run a Japanese sushi restaurant, the chefs needs to know how to cut salmon for sushi. \u00a0The rest of the dishes were just as botched up. Sushi rolls looked different shapes and sizes, no uniformity to sashimi slices, and where are all the lovely waitresses that use to work here? Presentation is loss. Taste wise very average, but my appetite had already gone after this point. Its really a shame, I once use to eat here fortnightly, but tonight might be my last.",

We got there 1 hour before closure and they were simply not putting new sushi on the belt, which we noticed after 10 minutes of sitting there and grabbing 1-2 plates from it. We ordered after that but not the best experience. They had run out of a lot of fish, basically only had tuna, eel and salmon left.Inexpensive atmosphere but not so inexpensive sushi. Lingo around the corner is overall much better. Their sake is pretty good though. And some of the prepared rolls were good as well. Service was fine. May be better for busy lunch times.",

I would recommend trying all of the nigiri as kulu kulu has some of the freshest fish I have found in London. My top recommendations would be the soft-shell crab hand roll, the scallop nigiri, the barbecued eel nigiri and the miso eggplant. The restaurant is conveyor belt style but the staff will gladly accommodate if there is anything else you fancy. I forced myself to try more exotic things, as I typically stick to tuna and salmon rolls. If you are going to be brave and try some different fish this is the place to do it.",

Also when the weather Gods allow it why not when the Golden Squares is just a few steps away!The take away menu is quite adequate but it is always a plus when you can mix and match according to your own preference; my sister cannot live without Edamame!! The Sushi sizes are generous and the fish is fairly fresh. The fish fillet on the Nigiris I ordered were nicely cut but the rice could have been boiled a little longer, packed a little lighter and with a more noticeable vinegar taste. The Unagi (eel) and Tako (squid) were the ones I enjoyed the most but this is not a memorable place or sushi to be honest! \u00a0It is not bad but no way near what those decade old reviews promises! Honestly I feel Kulu Kulu becomes first and only a good bang for the buck when ordered to go! Eating inside will add nothing to the experience other than a much and to me unjustified larger hole in your wallet!",

I visited the place twice based on their recommendation. \u00a0Second time it wasn't as good as the first time. That was on december 30th late in the day so I assume they were getting ready to close for the holidays.It's a cozy and small place. When you sit by the belt, you will easily touch elbows with the person sitting next to you. Not an ideal place for a group of more than 4. Even 4 might be pushing it depending on the time of the day! \u00a0 If you go during early dinner hours, you may need to wait for a seat because of the business crowd they attract. Overall, they seem to have a good selection of sushi and if you don't see something on the conveyor belt but is on the menu, you can always tell the staff and they will ask the chefs to prepare a few servings and put them on the belt. Probably the best experience I had was when I was sitting next to a pregnant Japanese lady . She talked to the staff about something and next thing I know, they had 3 plates of one of my favorite handrolls on the belt. As I tried to reach over and grab one of the plates, I bumped elbows with her and realized that this was her special order!!! So I let her took the first plate since she seemed to be craving this roll! \u00a0I managed to grab the second one. Best part of the place is that you can eat according to your budget. On the wall, they have all their serving plates with different designs and their respective prices. So you can pick things based on how much money you want to spend. Cheapest are the simplest maki rolls and the hand rolls are more on the higher price end. They also have 4-5 tables where you can sit and order from the menu. I think they have noodles and a few other things on their menu as well",

There are loads of sushi places on Brewer Street and around lunch time you can find amazing take away sushi in all sizes and flavours. Not so much around 6pm.So I made the decision to go into Kulu Kulu Sushi and order my sushi directly, instead of taking it off the shelves. They were still open, they had customers and I could see that they had a kitchen. Like Sherlock I deducted that the sushi should be reasonable fresh.The menu for takeaway is extensive and you can either go for a set menu or put your favourites together yourself. I decided on California rolls, a couple of maki rolls and also experimented with the spinach in peanut sauce. All of it came out of the kitchen reasonable fast and fresh. I have to say that it was good sushi. Not great, but not bad either!",

    "text": "Being in London for a year now, you learn that the Picadilly Circus/Soho/Chinatown area is where you go for a good hole in the wall Ramen/Sushi/Don fix. After doing a little suit shopping for a new job on Regent Street, my heart set itself on a small snack of ramen.I've walked past this place a couple of times and saw that it was relatively busy. I've even gone in once where I thought that it's just a conveyor belt sushi place. This time round, I was determined to give this place a go. You walk in, and you're greeted by non-Japanese people. While I'm totally for diversity in a business, it gets increasingly scary when you notice the sushi chefs, the wait staff and all but the manager of this place are not Japanese. A Japanese place not run by Japanese people!? Hmm... Ok... Maybe it's still worth a shot. BUT proceed with caution is what Lumach (my new nickname for my stomach) said. Ordered a tempura soba soup bowl, and an agadeshi tofu. The agadeshi tofu was freshly fried but the batter was not crispy brown. The tempura soba bowl was just lukewarm and the tempura, while also freshly fried was also done too quickly to produce any color or good taste. The only saving grace of this place was that the tempura soba bowl was \u00a33.10, and the agadeshi tofu \u00a31.50. CHEAP. But you get what you pay for... The soba bowl was a medium size in japan, at best. I'd honestly rather walk down the street to Taro and get me a proper meal... but if you're looking for a snack sized portion, I guess this would suffice. As with all my reviews: Will I go back? Probably not, not when there are tons other places in the area that I like better.",

    "text": "REVIEWING FOR TAKEAWAY.I've not yet sat in Kulu Kulu for lunch, but I have grabbed takeaway a couple of times on the way back to the office. For that, it's a really great little find. The sushi is fresh and generous, with much larger portions than you'll find in your average Itsu, Wasabi, etc. Much tastier than the usual takeaway places too! You can definitely taste how freshly prepared the food is. The other advantage is the speed of service, I've been in a couple of times and usually my order is ready in under 5 mins. As for price, today I bought 8 nigiri pieces ( 4 salmon, 4 tuna). and 4 pieces of salmon sashimi for just over \u00a310. Rolls (8 pieces) are priced at around \u00a37-8. Smaller individual portions are available around the \u00a32-3 mark.",

    "text": "Fresh sushi although not great variation and very basic preparation. Also the pieces of fish are chunky servings which defeats the delicate tasting of raw fish. Sushi and sashimi, in my opinion, should be several cuts of small sliced portions rather than a couple of big blocks of fish. The western looking guy needs more Asian schooling \u00a0says a western from south America living in Australia.",

    "text": "This is OK sushi... just OK. The staff are fairly non-existent it seemed and it felt that they were just cramming people in. The actual sushi is generally ok, nothing discernibly bad and there were some squash fritters that were delicious, but on the whole it didn't blow me away.The price is pretty good and this is what makes this place worth visiting at all. To get better sushi you have to pay quite a lot more money. For a quick cheap sushi top-up it's not bad.",
