    "text": "UPDATE: 22-feb 2012... We went back for lunch buffet today and the quality of the food had plummeted. The place was almost completely empty, so word's got round. A vile mini selection of horrid damp looking offerings, tepid, flavourless. It was embarrassing , actually and very disappointing.So..from five stars to one. I'd give it no stars if I could. Maybe the dinner's better.Below is my original review:I've been sitting in the traffic in front of this restaurant for years now and today, at lunchtime, I finally tried it.Buffet lunch. On one side, cold stuff like coleslaw and salads, the other side, curried chick peas and a bunch of other stuff that doesn't sound so great but is ( I mean curried chickpeas doesn't exactly make you want to run into the street and shout: 'TAXI! Take me to North End Road', does it?)I love buffet lunches. Love them. I wish there were more around here and I also wish there were more vegetarian places...but now I've discovered both in the 222.Nice clean, relaxed atmosphere, stripped wooden tables, white walls, water colours of flowers, I think...anyway, the real point of this review is to tell you how absolutely delicious and wonderful \u00a0and fresh and top notch quality everything was.The buffet lunch costs \u00a37.50 and you can eat as much as you want, and it's not one of those eat as much as you can cram onto one plate scenarios, you can keep going back.",

Despite the abundance of words like seitan, tofu, and soya cottage cheese on the menu this place is great. The flavours were amazing, an interesting blend of asian and afro-caribbean style food. I was with a carnivorous person who loved it too. We swapped dishes back and forth trying as much as possible but will definitely be back to sample other items on the menu. The only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars was the cost and the hideous organic wine (which is standard with organic wines).",

    "text": "Wow, what a wonderful surprise! \u00a0I was in the neighborhood to view a flat, and thanks to a miscalculation arrived half an hour early. I happened to be hungry; there was a random vegetarian restaurant with a reasonably-priced all-you-can-eat buffet; what did I have to lose?As it turns out, I wasn't merely pleased, but actually quite shocked by just how good the food was. Sumptuous. Refined. But in no way shy about the flavours, which were big and bold -- just the way I like it. I cannot imagine how it could have been better.Almost everything else was perfect, too: the decor was serene and pleasing, and the waitress was both gracious and sweet and efficient. The only minor blemish -- if I really press myself to find *something* negative to report, however trivial -- was that when I first walked in, I recall thinking that somewhat tacky music was playing. Any annoyance at the music, however, was thoroughly obliterated by the first bite of that exquisite food, and all was instantly forgiven. Seriously, it's good. I'll be dreaming of those curried chickpeas for weeks. If what the first reviewer says is true -- that the lunch buffet doesn't live up to the items on the menu, then I can't even *conceive* of how good those must be.Alas, the flat turned out to not to be the right place for me, which is a crying shame, because I'd love to live in the same neighborhood as this gem. In any case, I shall certainly return. I'm glad to see that others are raving about it as well -- 222 is a place that deserves to be known and loved.",

Travelling 10 km across the city on a Saturday morning to have Vegan food. I didn't expect it of myself, and i won't repeat it ... the experience wasn't that good.Sure the lunch buffet was very cheap ... and the food wasn't too bad. But i didn't find it to be too memorable either. The organic wine and the non-dairy ice-creams, though good, were not good enough to force me to abandon their \"normal\" counterparts. I agree that the chickpeas curry was really nice (as mentioned in many of the other reviews), but if i ever have a craving for chickpeas, i would rather visit one of the hundred odd Indian restaurants between my apartment and 222.I had visited after seeing the great reviews this place had on yelp, and i was curious about trying seitan (haven't seen it anywhere closer). Unfortunately its available in the dinner menu and not in the lunch buffet, so i shall have to wait.The place had decent vegetarian food, and i can imagine that it would be very popular in a vegetarian unfriendly city like London ... but it just wasn't spectacular enough to convert me.",

However, when two of our party ordered the apricot and almond cake, the staff tried to serve banana cake instead. They ended up admitting they had no apricot cake and gave the banana cake for free, so it made up for it somewhat. I recommend the Samuel Smith organic beer, goes down a treat.

Came here for lunch on a Saturday and was quite excited given the reviews - \u00a0unfortunately it was a major disappointment.They were offering a lunch buffet which I generally enjoy but half the options were missing and those that were available were uninspired and bland particularly compared with other vegetarian options in the city. Nothing but an assortment of stir fry vegetables and pasta salads. The coffee was burnt and the service slow (even for a buffet). The meal was \u00a37.50 each which is extortion given the options which is essentially a glorified salad bar.",

Not once were we disappointed. Everything was fresh and delicious. This is the type of vegetarian place you can take EVERYONE to, meat eaters included. \u00a0The food is well prepared, seasoned, and presented beautifully.The service was stellar as well.

It was a nice way to spend a quite evening for dinner.Red lentil soup was really spot on - warm and filling, just a slight hint of spiciness to warm the soul. Very generous portion - really appropriate on a chilly fall in London.I haven't had a stroganaff in ages, so it was quite a treat to order the seitan stroganaff`as a main. The cashew cream sauce was delicious, and it went well with the with the brown rice. This was vegan comfort food at its best.For dessert, I'm a sucker for vegan deserts and The Spice Island Pie was raw, gluten/wheat free and completely yummy!I was able to get away with three courses and sparkling water for around \u00a321.I'm looking forward to going back very soon!",

The kitchen dishes out some inspired food, a far cry from many samey brown veg options you'll find elsewhere - vegetables are highlighted, flavours stand out, and there are a good variety of proteins on offer (seitan, tofu, legumes). A number of dishes are Carribean-inspired, but there are also salads, a burger and pasta dishes that have their own unique appeal.If you still have room, make sure you try the pancake and ice cream for dessert - it's just fantastic.Although the lunch buffet is simpler, there is still a decent range of hot foods and cold salads to feast on, all of which are just as well-made and flavoursome as the a la carte offerings. I found it great because it allowed me to try a little of everything to see what I enjoyed most, and then go back for some more.Despite 222 Veggie Vegan being a little off the beaten path due to not being smack bang in the middle of central London, it's well worth a visit. Staff are friendly and helpful, and the dining experience is a relaxed and enjoyable one.",

I've been here several times and have thoroughly enjoyed it, albeit service is a bit slow, but it just makes my moments with friends more enjoyable.The staff is totally sweet and the decor of the restaurant is warm, sets a nice atmosphere where one can just relax.The chips are delicious and I never leave without having the 222 pancake. GET THE PANCAKE, it's like heaven...I promise that you won't regret it. I always get it with an extra serving of chocolate ice cream and am always delighted when it's set down before me...my eyes just light up at the sight of a pancake that's drenched in chocolate and vanilla sauce, but the most orgasmic thing is when I take the first bite...oh my, if I had a boyfriend I would choose this over him any day -- so amazing!My visits have always rotated between these: avocado pomodoro, 222 gardens, 222 burger, and pasta with wild mushrooms. Can't venture far from these, my heart is set! I had my first elderflower drink here and have always ordered it since (though the smoothies are delicious), it complements my meal as it is light and has the perfect touch of fragrant sweetness. Can't wait to try out the buffet, midday grubbing before shopping? Count me in!",

On returning we were told to wait for a further 15 minutes. When we objected - the server started to raise his voice and lied about trying to call us and inform us about a table that had cleared up a little while back.

I could barely sit down without bumping the people on either side of me, and I'm not big. The waitstaff seemed flustered and had a hard time setting food on these tables as they were so close together and near the cash register/kitchen walkway. I got the appetizer of artichoke hearts, which they brought before bringing my drinks. I reminded the waiter and he brought my drinks right away. The artichoke hearts were cooked perfectly and tasted fresh; they were served on saut\u00e9ed spinach leaves and a tiny smear of some bland condiment. There was zero seasoning and I got bored of it halfway through. For my main I had the seitan stroganoff which is apparently the customer favorite. Again, it was bland and lacked a depth of flavor. I ate half and grew bored of searching for flavor that wasn't there. The glass of white wine I ordered was not good. I took a risk and ordered dessert which was the only redeeming quality of the meal. I ordered the chocolate gateau and a glass of red wine. These were delicious and paired together so well; I would go back again just for dessert. \u00a0tl;dr mehhhhh....just get dessert!",

If they don't like big bookings maybe they shouldn't have taken it. I personally, did not want to deal with their stress, on my birthday with friends. My wife had booked a table of 16, we had told them two people were not coming immediately. Four more did not show, which we informed them about by half an hour in. The Front of house supervisor was rude to my wife on first confrontation. Not really an acceptable attitude. Friends enjoyed their meals and all the food was great as I said earlier, a little more consideration, would not have gone a miss though.",

(Kudos to the curried chickpeas).So why only three stars?Most of the non-dessert menu is pure good-for-you-blah.Vegetables are colorful - crunchy enough to have their nutrients preserved -and totally tasteless.Enjoy your vitamins because you won't necessarily be enjoying your meal.And the place is so crowded it is not comfortable to sit, relax, or even stand up to go to the buffet or go to the toilet.It is somewhat like eating vegetarian food in a Japanese subway.Now - fair is fair - it is crowded because lots of Baron's Court folks love the place.And there is nothing like it in the neighborhood.But if you want really good vegetarian food, there are so many veggie indian places - so many great turkish mezze places and so many good small scale health fooderies,that you don't have to settle for nutritious and boring.(Unless - of course - you want dessert - heh heh)Then the calculations change.",

    "text": "You simply won't find better vegetarian and vegan food in West London for this price range. It's an easy walk from West Brompton or West Kensington. It's a bit small, so if you're coming some distance you should probably make reservations. They don't have a lot of room.The dishes are inventive and interesting and thoroughly veggie and vegan. You'll find raw food options, too. It is clear that they want to thrill the vegetarians, not just please them. I struggle every time i come. The lure of dishes I know well competes with my desire to try new things. My friend from America got Ben's Special (a dish I usually get) and ordered it spicy. It was proper spicy and he was sweating (in a good way)I've eaten here many times over the years and am shocked I haven't reviewed it yet. I even had them make platters of food for a party once, and it was all the talk of my guests.The service is standard English service. Not quite as attentive as Americans might like, but friendly and gets the job done. Really, you go for the food, not the service. And you won't be disappointed.",

In fact, couple of times we had to go back disappointed because we didn't reserve the seats and the place was full, but instead of getting angry, we felt happy for them that they are doing well :-)They serve buffet for lunch and A La Carte for dinner, we have tried both and liked equally. For regular visits, buffet seems more attractive as the cost is less, but we really liked their A La Carte also. There are very limited vegan all-you-can-eat buffets in London, and this is the only one we found where the spread is quite healthy as well.The place is bit small, and menu options could seem a bit limited, but hey, we would still rate this as one of the best places.",

    "text": "Why is it that one only discovers the gems in a local neighbourhood just as one is about to leave it? 222 Veggie Vegan is an 5 star joint however I look at it. It's super-cheap, for one: \u00a37.50 for the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet is incredible value, particularly when one considers the 'pay-per-weight' policy usually applicable to vegetarian places (e.g. Tibits). Second, the quality and variety of food is really good. The cold salads include tomato and lettuce, avocado and spinach and red cabbage, while the hot dishes centre around chickpeas, polenta, potato and most memorably, plantain.There's quite a bit on the menu beyond the lunchtime buffet too: a couple of organic beers (the pretty decent Sam Smiths organic lager and the rather average Freedom organic lager), smoothies and unexpectedly delicious organic, fairtrade coffee. There are desserts too: my eyes were instinctively drawn to the wholewheat pancake that I was too stuffed to try, but made a mental note of for next time.And finally, the atmosphere here is great, with a truly representative mix of locals to be found here. And on laid-back, diverse, unpretentious, friendly North End Road that's a good thingSeriously, I am gutted that in 5 weeks time I'll be living 20 minutes cycle ride from this place rather than the 3 minutes walk that I currently do. But I fully expect to be making the trip on a regular basis regardless.",

Even if meals are made from scratch, the management needs to have a better system - or diners should be warned ahead of time just how long a meal is going to take. We made reservations for 5:30pm, and when we arrived, a table was waiting for us. There was only one other party at the time we were seated. We ordered our appetizer and entrees, and then the wait began. It took close to an hour to even get the appetizer. I let the server know that we were on a bit of a time crunch, as we had plans after that required us to be out at a specific time (6:45, not a minute later). The server was very nice about it, and she kept talking with the kitchen to let them know the situation, but it wasn't really a successful venture. We finally received our entrees around 6:40pm (and that was after multiple \"conversations\" with the kitchen to speed it up), so we had very little time to eat. We weren't even able to get out of the restaurant on time, despite it all. We actually paid our check before the food even came, and the server felt so bad that she gave us a 10% discount on the check. The food was good, but I had such little time to enjoy it that I can honestly barely remember it enough to decide whether it was among the better vegan dishes I had on my trip to London. Even more disappointing, we had no time to try any of the desserts, which was one thing that had persuaded us to check out this restaurant in the first place.My advice for visiting this restaurant is to make early reservations, don't come incredibly hungry, and be prepared to spend the entire evening there. This is not the place for a meal before a special event or a show, even if you give yourself what seems like plenty of time.",

The grid patterns of our roads are like shattered glass. Blame the medievals for London and blame the oil barons for LA but the ups and downs and turns made going to vegan buffets really delectable (and economical if you're a pig like me). Some of the favourites foods of mine included quinoa, their plantains (without potatoes), avocado salad and cold cashew cream salad. The quinoa is nice and hot and perfectly cooked. The plantains offered a great flavour and wish they were served on their own. A Yelp friend of mine Jessica T. once wrote on Yelp that she prefers to indulge in carbs that delight her tastebuds, not dull them. I find that to be something to live by, which is why I don't usually eat potatoes when other more flavourful carbs are offered. The cold cashew cream salad was incredibly delicious and had a great creamy consistency. And fresh avocados in any salad always win.The cooks began changing the food at 12:30pm (they open at 12pm) so that was a very great sign that the food was incredibly fresh. I am never in this area when I am in London. It is more west than most of the vegan places here, near the West Kensington tube. But it was definitely worth coming to when I was on the way to Heathrow. For those whose phones are perpetually out of battery life, they have outlets next to many of the tables too!",

There wasn't anything I didn't like; standouts included the cold bean/eggplant salad and the various stews/curries. Service was friendly and attentive. My only criticism is that the food was a bit on the salty side. This could just be a personal preference, but the man dining next to me also said it was too salty for his taste. However, 222 Veggie Vegan and its lunch buffet was wonderful, and I will definitely be back!",

Two of us shared the avocado soup which was pretty good and not too thick/heavy. I had the vegan roast with the seitan and it was excellent. I would definitely come back here and recommend it to others. The others I was with had Ben's special and the stroganoff plates, which they also said were very filling and delicious! It wasn't tooo expensive for what we got (60 pounds for 3 mains + 1 starter soup + 1 bottle of wine). If you're interested in trying vegan food, I'd try it out :)",

    "text": "Solid vegan food at this place. I've been here once before, when I had some sort of pumpkin dish and was bowled over. This time around, on Sunday night, whilst not l \u00a0the dishes were phenomenal, they were still very good. I got the raw avocado soup which was incredibly creamy and a large portion. The flavour of cashew is apparent in the soup and is a perfect complement to the avo. I also got the bean and tofu pancakes (black-eyed beans and tofu stuffed in two wholemeal wraps with a vegan cream sauce). These were ok... didn't blow me away. The dish needs a greater kick. I also got the pumpkin and courgette noodles with coconut and chopped Brazil nuts in a lime/ginger sauce, and the spiced almond cake, for takeaway. I had the noodles for lunch today and they are amazing due to the sauce. I could eat that ALL the time. The dessert is incredibly soft and crumbly with a tasty blend of nuts and spices. It looks like and has somewhat the texture of cheesecake but is WAY better. And oh yeah I had a smiling and helpful waitress (!!!!)",

    "text": "Visited this little hidden gem when we were in London a few weeks ago. Most of the menu is vegan and everything sounded so good. Ten minute walk from our hotel too... Result! The decor is simple and clean looking, nothing fancy. They do a vegan buffet during the day, but we were visiting at night. Had heard wonderful things about their stroganoff, so already knew I was going for this. Seitan strips, caramelised onions, fresh herbs and pepper cubes in cashew cream, served with organic brown basmati rice. This dish was beautiful! Had a lovely, refreshing glass of white wine to wash it down. Service was pretty fast, given that the waitress had just started working there and was being trained along the way. She was really friendly too.The menu is impressive, I could have ordered everything from it. We only went for main courses as we were a little pushed for time. They have a very small selection of raw vegan dishes too, as well as desserts. Not the cheapest place to eat, with my main alone coming in at \u00a311, but everything tasted so fresh and well seasoned. Wouldn't hesitate to go back.",
