I worked just around for corner recently, so i would usually visit once every week with a work colleague. The restaurant is always clean and tidy, and the staff are really quick in getting you in and seated. Everybody sits on benches, it sorta remins me of my old school canteen, but Wagamamas is much more posh. The food is really nice. I have not yet tried a dish i don't lilke. You have lots to choose from, and also lots of lovely dishes to start with too. The prices are really cheap for the quality of the food you get. Located near Selfridges, so great for a place to stop for food after a big shop.",

My side order of Yasai Gyoza came as a partially cooked assembly of dumplings that were barely warm and felt rubbery in taste. Had to send them back to the kitchen to have them remade.On the other hand, my order of Saiben Soba was an above-average preparation, though still lacking in essential flavors. On previous occasions that I have visited this location, I have had a much better vegetarian ramen served on their menu.I am hoping the food will get improved and I would like to return soon for another tasting.",

    "text": "Wagamama seems to be a bit better than OK, but I'm not ready to call myself a fan. . . so this is probably more of a 3.5 star place, but I'm in a \"round down\" mood today.The set up is somewhat unique. There aren't a bunch of small tables or chairs, but rather a number of long tables with built-in benches. They remind me of the cafeteria tables in school, except the benches are broken up (you can fit about two people per bench segment) which mean it's easier to sit down and get up than those terrible benches from grade school that ran the length of the whole table.The space is nice. The kitchen is open. Service is OK. They seem to use a team approach, rather than having a dedicated server for a table. This lead to someone trying to take our drink orders after we already placed our orders, and three different people trying to take our orders at one point or another. There are pluses and minuses to this approach to service, but in general I'm not a fan.The ginger beer was tasty. The food is...well, not as good as I'd like it to be. My chicken katsu curry was just kind of bland, which was disappointing. The panko-breaded chicken was good, but the gravy definitely fell short. I tried another chicken dish that my friend ordered, and it was also a little lacking in flavor.The dessert was pretty average. I tried a bite of the apple & sweet yam tart, and it was a bit different, but interesting. I'm not a big apple dessert person so I'm not sure I'd order it myself. My foodie friend who ordered it didn't like the sesame seed element or the vanilla sauce it was sitting in (which turned out to be melted ice cream, according to our waitress). My baked vanilla cheesecake was OK. Nothing memorable.They bring out the food in a rather willy-nilly fashion. You might get your main dish before your starter, and your main dish might come out minutes before anyone else in your party gets anything, so be prepared to eat in front of your friends or sit and watch them eat.I'd probably eat at a Wagamama again if it was convenient, but I wouldn't go out of my way or wait for a table.",

Noodle soup tastes miserable. But gyoza is quite acceptable and crispy enough in a good size. Salad is what could attract the lowest mark from people if served in Japan. \u00a0I have never tried rice-based dishes as they look like a takeaway from Mars, or Moon at best. However I go and eat at Wagamama at least once a week in Spitalfield as they are reasonably quick and the service is efficient.",

I visited this branch the other day and ordered my Kasai Katsu Curry (the veggie one) along with my Duck guyoza. Well my starter came at the end of my main course - how hard can it be to deep fry some duck spring rolls??? My curry was dissapointing - the aubergine was mushy and in stark contrast the sweet potato was rock solid. I tried to attack it with a knife, and when i couldn't i passed due to the possible repurcussions on my poor digestive system. I think everytime i visit Wagamama my heart falls slightly, it has turned into something great to something mediocre, and everytime i crave to get the first experience of my lovely curry. Even my apple and lime juice lacked pizzaz. Hopefully will buck its ideas up soon. The staff are always good, so there is a saving grace!",

    "text": "Oh Wagamama.....My love. You're a bit overpriced and really not authentic but I don't care. I have so many good memories of eating here with classmates while studying abroad so I had to come back tonight while on vacation! This food is very similar to PF Changs here in the States which means very good albeit a bit costly. I had the Udon Noodle plate which was about \u00a39 but was a rather large portion a full of chicken, shrimp and scallops. It was delicious and filled me up which is all I can ask for. Service was great as well, the food came out quickly and we were checked on a few times during the meal. Finally the space (like pretty much all Wagamamas) is large, simplistic and stylish. There is a lot of choices for great food in London and Wagamama is definately one of them!",

The service still annoys me tho",

I really enjoyed my vegetarian ramen, however my husbands pad Thai was \"just ok\", nothing special. The main disappointment here was that the food does not come out together so my husband was finished by the time my meal came. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the restaurant was very clean. I would go back here for some ramen but probably wouldn't make a special trip for it.",

After being rebuffed by two ramen places which had closed at 2 o'clock (I slept too long), we ended up here which has full service throughout the day.It's really weird because you can tell there is some authenticity in the menu (Wagamama is the brainchild of a Hong Konger), but all servers and line cooks are either locals or Eastern Europeans!Anyway, it was what I needed, when I needed it; I wouldn't come back normally but it satisfied me so 3 stars...",

Served in a traditional large bowl even tho the chefs weren't Japanese they did a good job! Service was good came and sat us and greeted kindly, and gave us recommendations for the many dishes. The place kinda reminded me of a cafeteria abut like I was back in high school with an open style kitchen and long bench tables, but clean and homey. Would come here again to try something else on the menu for sure.",

We just wanted something simple and close by and Wagamama was the choice.Unfortunately it was a bad choice!The ramen is the worst I had ... ever! And I had plenty of ramen around the world from Tokyo to LA to now London. My wife ordered the chili chicken ramen and I ordered the pork ramen. I really don't know what to say - it just didn't taste right or good and something about the flavors were just off. Oh right - there was no flavor! I ate about 1/4 of my bowl and decided I didn't want to eat anymore. And I was starving too!Not to mention, the extra cup of green tea I ordered never came (since I was drinking green tea to wash down my food) and in the end, I stood at the counter and waited for a good while to pay. It seemed all the servers were busy and just walked by me left and right. The place was busy but it wasn't packed house at all, since we went in the early afternoon. Maybe it was an off day for service and food?So my experience with service was slow and the experience with the food was just horrible. I would not recommend going there if you actually enjoy eating ramen. I'm sure whatever ramen you had before, it is way better than this.",
