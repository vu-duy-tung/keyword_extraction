After some research, we decided to walk the 1.5miles to Il Blandford, as it looked like it would be authentic Italian food with great service. We were not disappointed. We got there at 5 after 9, and were told that the kitchen had just closed. After hearing that we walked specifically to eat at their restaurant, the owners said they would reopen the kitchen so we could eat. We were served solives and breadsticks to start, which were quite tasty. Two of us got the gnocchi, one had lasagna, and two had the house special, which was pasta in a cream based sauce with broccoli and potatoes. All of us loved our food couldn't believe how accommodating and friendly everyone was, including one of the other patrons, who offered to give up his seat so we could all sit together. I will absolutely recommend this place to anyone wanting a fantastic restaurant experience in London.",

The place is so warm and cosy, it feels like you've been invited into the front room of their family home. Then there's the food of course! Great selection, fairly priced. We went for a pizza and a pasta to share and they were both delish. We could easily have left it at that but the waitress tempted us with a slice of homemade carrot cake which we practically inhaled it was so good. This was naturally washed down with some top notch coffee. Like so many good cafes and restaurants in London, seating is limited, but I highly recommend you squeeze yourself in if you can!",

I also had their Turkish eggs, which were delicious, with the Greek yogurt and the paprika butter, very creamy and delightful! Their Spanish eggs were also great as well, came out piping hot and was a good dish on a crisp day. Their espresso is really good, no almond milk though, was sad about that.

The place wasn't too busy, so I was expecting decent service. When ordering, I specifically asked for no tomatoes, as the taste of sliced raw tomatoes truly nauseates me. Lo and behold, when my order comes out, it has tomatoes on it! I stared down dissatisfied at my plate, which cost \u00a39.50 and appeared truly messy- as if it had just been thrown together. Not to mention that instead of the crisp bacon I had been expecting, I was given thick slices of ham. The server looked at me and said \"you look like you don't like it! Sorry about the tomatoes.\" And walked away. If you clearly remember that I didn't order tomatoes, why give them to me? Also, it's worth noting that the portion sizes are WAY smaller than I expected for the price.",

I've bopped past Blandford's several times as its located quite conveniently to my temporary apartment. It's always got at least a few parties perched about eating tasty looking food, and a line at the counter for to-go items...so today I made it the day that Blandford's and I become friends. The name must be a carryover from days of yore, as there is very little chance any of these Italians go by the name \"Blandford.\" However, cheers to them for keeping the history! It also appears many other elements were preserved. The furniture, decor, etc. It's definitely got a retro vibe, in a good way. It's clean as a whistle, though. I was seated promptly, equipped with aforementioned Americano and side of milk and then decided on a veggie omelette (3 eggs!) and one side sausage for good measure and protein. At just 5pounds plus a bit extra on the sausage, I think a deal. All in I was out the door with a VERY filling breakfast for just about 7pounds. The service was friendly, the food hot and freshly prepared...it's got all the basics, and definitely tends toward a more traditional breakfast (think eggs, meats, beans, toasts, and the like), but Italian-influenced lunch specials. They even allow you to bring in your own beer and wine (assuming that's a dinner thing, but hey..perhaps you like a nip with your morning meal?). I'll be a regular.",

Workmen in uniforms were mowing through hearty breakfast dishes whilst gents in suits popped in for takeaway coffee. The staff jabbered to one another in Italian and more than one visitor tossed a recognisable 'buon giorno' to the servers. Your chances of dining in may be curtailed by the limited seating; there's likely room for only about twenty.And as far as my coffee went, I have no complaints. A simple americano to take away was a mere \u00a31.80 - more affordable than most competitors in Marylebone. Lunch offerings look to be quite traditional Italian fare and certainly worth a followup visit to compare against my visits to Italy!",

Independent restaurants and cafes just seem to be more charming than chains. Or at least I like to think so. When I walked in, one of the sons greeted me and I saw the mother and father chatting away in Italian at a small table in the corner. It was really cute to see the father overseeing his son and I think nephew and kind of guiding/teaching them.I ordered a pot of English breakfast and their full English breakfast, which consisted of toast, ham, two sausage links, a sunny side up egg, mushrooms, and tomatoes. No beans or black pudding though.Service was quick. There were only 4 other people in the restaurant and they only ordered drinks. It's a small establishment, but a good breakfast nonetheless. A little on the pricey side (\u00a310.60 for the tea and breakfast) as there are many more places in London that are cheaper, but I do like to support family businesses.",

Fantastic pasta bolognese with fresh noodles that were perfectly cooked, and utterly perfect minestrone soup exploding with vegetables and subtle flavors.Jessica, the young Italian emigre owner, managed to exude a combination of efficiency and warmth that was great! She actually harangued me to finish my pasta because they don't like wasting food and they're serving it with love, goddamit! I also had a very nice chat with her father, an emigre from Sicily by way of New York. This was a great refuge on a cold, rainy afternoon. We will definitely be back on our next trip to London, and probably for more than just one meal next time.",

While I was eating, another patron complimented the hostess on the food, and she in turn invited him to look into the kitchen and see the grittle -- as that is the key to all the delicious meals. It's the perfect little place to pop into with friends or on your own for a quality Italian brunch experience against the soundtrack of Italian being rapidly spoken and the delicious smells from both the coffee (illy) and the dishes. If I lived in the area, I would definitely become a regular. The only reason I give 4/5 stars is because there is a pretty high minimum for card payments.",

Their focaccia breakfast is a fantastic Italian take on the great British/American breakfast tradition: poached eggs on foccacia toast smothered in olive oil so fresh you can taste the olives... served with slices of remarkably-fresh tasting tomatoes and avocado and bacon for some salty goodness. It's poetry, my friends. Seriously, you should drop what you're doing and go have breakfast here now.",

A quick search on yelp brought me to Il Blandfords- and my goodness was I pleased!Fantastic customer service from the mostly, if not all, Italian team who made us feel right at home. The breakfast menu which is served all day had several tantalising options, but I was drawn to the Spanish Eggs, baked eggs in tomato sauce with piquillo peppers, olives, chorizo, jamon Iberico and cheese (well I added the cheese because why not?). Oh...em...gee!My dish arrived hot and bubbly, with still runny yolks dancing in a sea of perfectly seasoned sauce. The chorizo and jamon have the dish a salty kick, while the buttered white toast provided the perfect vessel for sopping up every last bite.Honestly- it tasted like a well made classic pizza- but for breakfast, and with eggs. Just, wow. Perfect americano as well.I'll be back, especially as the dinner menu is packed with classic pasta dishes- and you can bring a bottle of wine?! I'm all in!",

But it feels right, it feels good and it feels welcoming.Bon Giorno! Usual greeting on entering, and you'll see that the British grub does, somehow, manage to have a bit of an Italian touch too.

I have been eyeing up Blandfords Cafe for a while (not physically, mind you, that would be creepy, because cyber stalking is so much more acceptable). I headed straight over and walked in tentatively, and was suprised that even at the odd timing, a few of the tables were occupied, a gentleman facing the street had just received his fragrant pizza, whilst the majority were enjoying their coffees.I was a man on a mission, so my first question was whether or not they would serve their spanish eggs on their breakfast menu despite it being mid-afternoon. After a quick check with the kitchen, they were happy to oblige. I ordered that and a latte.The latte was suprisingly good, the ground coffee was at the bottom of the glass, but all in all, it was a very decent coffee, it would beat your starbucks or costa anyday of the week. The spanish eggs came first (the toast was to follow), but I couldn't wait to dig in, so I broke into one of the runny eggs, and worked the yolk into the tomato sauce, peppers, onions, ham and salami/chorizo(?). It worked, the ingredients were simple and the meat was good, but not top-notch. But damn, it worked. The flavours were bright and more-ish, even without the bread to soak it all up, I happily ate a few spoonfuls, when the toast came, it only topped off the experience in style. I lapped up everything onto the toast and it was absolutely delightful. I want to come here for breakfast everyday. It is a tad steep, but I enjoyed myself thoroughly.",

The manager here puts lots of attention on food freshness and appearance, so this is the place to come if you want a real meal with an eye to detail, or a quiet late breakfast on weekdays. They also serve great pizzas. Down sides: dishes are pretty pricey for their size, it gets packed at lunch time, they don't accept credit cards (yet).",

I go to Blandford once a month on average for brunch, and that is quite a compliment given the abundance of brunch options in central London. While I can't speak for their non-brunch items, which I am sure are fantastic (pizza, pasta, lasagna etc.), I can tell you that they make some of the best eggs I've ever had. Turkish eggs, Eggs Florentine, Spanish Eggs, all amazing!!! And oh the Orange juice there is phenomenal. It is worth just going for that. Real freshly squeezed, sweet orange juice. Yum!!",

The warmth of the staff makes you think you have gone to the corner spot in the village where you are always welcomed and the toils of the daily life will be part of the conversation. Now the food!!! I have to say I am still looking for what I did not like and failing every time. The pizza is sublime like what you get in Napoli. The Burrata is not to be missed. But if ever they have the calamari on the menu, grab and have it any which way your heart desire. It is sure to delight. The vegetarian choices also abound. And this is not limited to pizza and pasta. The carnivores mains are amazing. I am walking my way down the list but somehow I am always distracted by the specials. I also keep spying other people's dishes and I want even when I am so satisfied that not a morsel could pass my lips. Of course they have deserts and \u00a0if like me not another bite could be had, there is affogado. For the unfamiliar that is ice cream in coffee and man that hits the spot. The Barista will cure you of any further satisfying trips to Starbucks and the likes. Now one warning the place is small so make sure you either send an email to book or go early. And please do not ever waste the table!But bonus, they serve breakfast. And for those like me who tire of a good old English Breakfast, imagine stuffed Italian croissant with cream with a great double expresso. Brings me back to Milan. So if you can work your way past the throngs of tourists on Bakker Street and go see the team at Il Blandford's and you will be transported to a little place in heaven for a few hours.",

It was really quiet when we went on a Saturday night but it was also eurovision night!We shared a burrata salad with cherry tomatoes and rocket to start. Burrata was super fresh and the tomatoes were tasty but it was lacking a little bit of flavour. Needed some salt or balsamic vinegar.We then shared a pizza and a gnocchi dish. Both were good but nothing amazing. I enjoyed them but my local Italian is better.However to be fair it is really cheap. Starter was 10 and each main was 10 so great value. Would go back if I was in the area but wouldn't make a special trip.",

There are only a few tables and chairs, and the decor isn't anything to write home about, but damn if they don't bring it with the service and food!We had a table, menus, and a waiter taking drink orders in less than two minutes. Water all around, and an appetizer to share a few minutes later. They serve the \"made with love by someone's nana\" Italian. Very simple, no fuss, straight up delicious Italian. I had a gnocchi with a spicy tomato sauce, veggies and just the right amount of parmesan. Everyone in our group ordered something different and we ate in silence aside from the \"man....mmmm....this is gooooood\"s coming from around the table. Can't believe people head to Strada on Baker Street when this is right around the corner. I'll be back!",

Truth be told, I've been walking by this place everyday for the past 1.5 years on my way to work, but I didn't feel drawn to it for some reason. Which is strange, as I'd seen it written up in Independent London and elsewhere as one of the local spots in London. I guess what didn't really attract me was the rather non-inspiring display of food in the counter; they use it more as a storage place than as a selling counter. So I went here and what I found is that this place is all about substance over style - and not the reverse. While the counter may not hold attractive stuff, what comes out of the kitchen is spot on and makes both my belly and my mind very happy. I can, at this point, only vouch for the breakfasts, but I will soon try their pizza - must be a winner as this place is run by true Italians!But Blandford's Caf\u00e9 really had won me over when I walked by it in the evening of the very same day that I had breakfast there. As I walked by, the owner's daughter waved at me. This was the call to action and the action would be to come back here as they want me to come back. It felt like family! I have since been back a couple times and every time I'm impressed at the great hospitality. It really seems that the majority of the people coming here is regulars as the staff greets them like this: \"The usual?\" or \"Are you sure you don't want the Spanish Eggs today?\" or \"I haven't seen you in a while.\"",

This place is a diamond in the rough for the budget-conscious of this pricey central London neighbourhood!Il Blandford (there is some confusion about the name, it shows up as The Blandford, Blandford's, Il Blandford, and various others in different sources) serves up English breakfasts and Italian fare (including pizzas, pasta and the like).I've been twice for breakfast, and both times were excellent. All the servers are really fun, interesting, and personable -- without the service feeling invasive. The space is small and cozy, without feeling cramped. And the food is tasty and satisfying, but light enough to enjoy fairly regularly. The English breakfast (which you might not expect to find in such an overtly Italian themed spot) is really fantastic.A special spot in Marylebone and if you're there, there's a good chance you'll spot me!",

The lasagna is amazing, but the pizza is too...nothing beats the genuinely welcoming staff as well!This cute cozy cafe is very popular and for good reasons...come for breakfast or for an early or late lunch! It's worth it :)",
