But the fact is that I went in very hungry and looking forward to a good meal and left feeling like I would have rather gone to Nando's.Issue - I had to travel by bus to get here. It's a local joint and by no means a travel-to-destination. And I was hungry!Issue - We came with a party of 8. If you have a party of more than 4, just don't go. In an attempt to get all plates out to two separate tables at once, we waited for about a 45 minutes to get our food. This does not bode well for a hungry man.Issue - I made the mistake of ordering the Mega Breakfast and assumed that it came with beans, as any English breakie should. It did not. My fault? Yeah I guess so, but that doesn't mean it deserves another star.Issue - The breakfast I had was good, but it was not fantastic by any means. A fine price, but I know of other places that are cheaper of the same quality and size.It has been judged and really an unfortunate thing in my eyes. \u00a0When inevitably I am dragged back here despite my best grumblings, hopefully the experience and cirumstances provide for a better experience and I can give it a better rating.And one that includes beans.",

You can get a huge English breakfast for a very cheap price and it fills you up. i came here, not knowing what to expect and left with a huge tummy full of delicious food. I have taken so many of my friends here and they all agree to it being some of the best food they've had. They also have a new lunch menu they just started, I haven't tried it yet, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was absolutely amazing. I highly suggest this to anyone who's hungry and wants a ridiculously amazing breakfast (English style ;])",

    "text": "Okay, I have been meaning to update my views on this for the last few weeks, as I have since been back and had a very different experience. Just have not had a moment to write this (sorry for the delay Cafe 338!) If you have read the previous review you may (rightly) wonder why I ever returned? Basically, I was coming home from a party with some friends and on getting off the tube at Bethnal Green, everyone started realise they were hungry. I suggested we go to Little Georgia, but this was vetoed due to being too far away. Plus, my girlfriend is a major fan of 338. I explained to her that it was impossible for me to go back due to the previous experience and the review. Reader, my protestations fell on deaf ears. It was recommended that I go in disguised. I was drunk enough to think this a good idea. It was not. The disguise consisted of a Chinaman's hat (conical Asian hat), which covered my face about a third of the way down. \u00a0This would have been a great disguise if I wasn't 6ft 3in tall. But I am and the woman who runs the cafe (my nemesis from the previous review), is very small and so could see my face right away. This was confirmed when she said, \"I know you, you are the man who wrote the review\". It was not possible to deny this. We exchanged a few words about each other previous attitudes. I focused on her rudeness. She on my drunkenness (which, I for some strange reason, forgot to mention in the previous review). After a moment or two of this we decided to become friends and even had a hug. I then spoke to the rest of the staff and then was served a giant breakfast with mountains of extra baked beans and hash browns. Dear reader, it was a moment that allows me to believe in the possibility of world peace. We are all human. Me, you, the entire staff of Cafe 338. We all make mistakes and we all let our moods get the better of us. But what we don't all do, is make breakfasts as amazing as the one I had a Cafe 338 on Bethnal Green Road on Saturday October 1st at approximately 6am. This was a breakfast that i will never forget.",

Everytime I come to Cafe 338 with some of our visiting family and friends, enjoying the faces they make when they see the place the first time, when we get served, and when we leave. I'm always amazed how efficient the cooks are, moving with dexterity in such a tiny kitchen, and how the waitresses keep track of so many people and orders with such many tables and little space to walk through...English breakfast is a must, but any other kind of combination is usually succulent. \u00a0The plates presentation also remains unequalled among breakfast places.Hail 338!",

Oh, and it has a massive queue on weekend mornings/afternoons, so bring a newspaper and be prepared to wait.This is my local brunch joint/hangover spot/place where I eat when I can't be bothered (aka hangover spot). Most of my neighbours who frequent this place seem to treat it in the same way that I do, explaining the bedraggled-looking, flannel-wearing, cigarette-scented crowd that you see here at noontime on Sundays. There's even a nice, little outdoor seating area for when it's not pouring with rain outside (= half-drunk hipsters on display).There's a little bit of everything at Cafe 338 - (as mentioned above) heaping portions of breakfast foods, a variety of Middle-Eastern themed salads and wraps (halloumi galore), and the \u00a0more traditional 'diner' food like burgers and greasy, breaded and fried potato and onion products, yay. And to keep said hipsters (and me) happy, there's a huge selection of veg options, including a full English with mock Glamorgan sausages and veggie bacon.As other reviewers have mentioned, the food here fills the stomach without emptying the wallet - no plate is over \u00a37, and in fact, most are under \u00a35 (this is probably why it's cash only). The waitstaff is incredibly pleasant and accommodates all sorts of strange requests and dish substitutions without a bat of the eyelash (one morning, my stomach told me it wanted pancakes and maple syrup with grilled halloumi and baked beans...and Cafe 338 complied). Also, there are free refills on filter coffee (!!!), which never happens in London...cherish it. \u00a0This has been quite a strange list of reasons why I love Cafe 338, but hopefully it convinces people to go. You really should go, it's pretty great.",

There were plenty of options for an English breakfast, but I found myself having pancakes alternating with eggs, sausage, grilled tomato, etc. The freshly squeezed OJ was delicious and they provided random fruit with the pancakes! (One day it was watermelon, another day there were grapes!) I returned to this place 3 out of the 4 mornings that I was in London and the service each day was pleasant and welcoming. The food was absolutely delicious each day to start my days off right and I don't think I spent more than 15\u00a3 for two any day. I highly recommend this place for English breakfast, I wish I could've tried their other food.",

After expressing my distaste towards the quality service I requested to have \u00a33 taken off the bill which was as total of \u00a313 and was in fact denied. The manager did not approach me himself and speak to me directly about the matter despite being 2 feet away from me, the waitress had delivered the news.

I asked the guy to move and he wouldn't, I asked the waitress to ask this guy to move to the table across from me and she said she couldn't move him to that table as the guy had been pestering those girls before. Finally I asked the guy again to move and he got up and shouted that he wouldn't want to world to see him sat opposite me as if we were on a \"fag**t date\" and he moved.Two kind girls told me to come and sit with them as they had heard the whole thing, and then myself and the girls suggested politely to the waitress that in the future she ask anyone who was being abusive to customers to leave. She said she wouldn't as he is \"a regular\". The girls pointed out to her that if someone had some in shouting racial abuse they would hope they would be asked to leave and that this was no different. At this point the waitress shoved her hand in my face to shh me and said \"look mate I don't give a f*ck about your sexuality, I just don't care\" as if that had been my point?I then suggested the same to the manager/owner and he said that the guy was a regular so they wouldn't be asking him not to come back. The two girls sat with me then stated that they were regulars and came there every day and they would not be coming back after this. I would expect the owners or staff to have a little more respect and decency and was quite shaken by their response.They also short changed me by \u00a35 and insisted that they hadn't.",

But everyone who goes there knows this & no one feels the need to make small talk if they're hungover. It's a buzzy spot on the weekend mornings. The sausages arent the best quality, and the beans are straight out of a tin. Its a grease spoon breakfast you're getting here, make no mistake, but it's a monster one and for only \u00a36.",

I love greasy spoon diners, and I love a full English breakfast, so I should have been in heaven here, right? Nope. The service was absolutely horrible.From the minute we walked in, the staff at 338 was terrible to us. I think my friends and I are pretty respectful tourists -- we go out of our way to try not to be the \"Awful Americans.\"When we walked in and saw it was tiny and tight, I went up to the counter to ask if we should wait to be seated or if we should just grab a table. The ladies working just stared at me like I had 2 heads. I had to ask 3 times before one of them finally (and nonchalantly) answered me. I've never had this type of language barrier in countries that *don't* speak English.For the record, you just grab a seat.Then, when we got seated, we looked on Yelp to make sure they accepted cards -- they don't. That's not a huge deal, but a sign on the door would have been helpful. Luckily, there's an ATM across the street, so nbd.Our server stopped by, and she was one of the rudest human beings I've ever met. When I started to order a breakfast plate and asked for scrambled eggs instead of fried, she just flatly said, \"NO.\" There was no offering me an option or explanation or trying to be helpful -- just \"NO.\" So then I had to figure out what the eff I was doing on my own and ended up ordering a la carte items instead. I didn't like my food at all. Was it terrible? No. But was it good? Negative, Ghost Rider. Also, the coffee was the worst.So why 3 stars if I clearly hated 338 so much? My friends didn't hate it nearly as much as I did. After a quick poll, opinions ranged from \"OK\" to \"Good,\" and they didn't get the brunt of the rudeness like I did. So maybe I'm being a tad over-dramatic. IMO, Cafe 338 must be a beloved spot for locals, but I wouldn't recommend that a visitor go there.",
