The food was okay, nothing special, and the portions weren't very big. The overall impression is that due to the amount of traffic Las Iguanas get thanks to the popular South Bank location, nobody cares if you will ever come back. If I were in the area again, I'd rather go to Cubana on Lower Marsh Street (behind Waterloo) where you can get all the cocktails and much more exciting food.",

For a Monday evening the restaurant and bar were ridiculously busy and we had to wait around forty minutes for a table. We filled that time with a cheeky cocktail which was rather nice. The dining area here is very busy and crowded. We were squeezed into a table with barely enough elbow room but the food and service more then made up for things. On this occasion we opted to have the taco sharing platter which is sensational and surprisingly large for the price (\u00a312). I'd like to come back here but don't know if this particular restaurant has a 'quiet night' given that even Mondays are busy here. 10/10 for the service",

They do a great deal on Cocktails at lunchtimes and a couple of Long Island Iced Teas (recommended) and I was starving...Try the XimXim, kind of a curry/Satay feel to it, but lots of extras for a hungry person and it was wonderful. (supposed to be Peles favourite and I can see why) My friends food was just as good, dont have starters, the mains are huge. The drinks are not too expensive and the staff were really great, friendly and attentive. The music was good too. I can highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "Came here in the summer for dinner with 2.5 friends*. \u00a0We were seated outside, by the walkway on the Thames and it was a beautiful night. The food were decent portions. I specifically remembered the Paella we ordered because a homeless woman** \u00a0had no problem devouring it. Did you just go back and re-read that sentence? My friends and I were enjoying our dinner and having a lovely conversation*** when a homeless woman came by and panhandeled while we were eating our dinner. My friend tenderly said that we didn't have any money for her but that we would have left overs. Sure enough the woman took her hand and started eating off the plates. Then she pointed to the paella my friend was still eating and asked in her lovely east London accent: \"What about that, are you going to eat it?\" and before anyone could answer, her fingers were digging in. No one knew what to say or do so we just sat and stared. By the time she polished off our Paella the waiter saw what was happening and \"shoe-ed\" the woman away. He apologized and said that the woman comes by begging for change often, then left. We all felt awful for this woman and would have loved to giver her our leftovers, if she left any. Maybe we brought it upon ourselves by being unclear as to what \"leftovers\" are. We ordered about 4 dishes (like I said i only remembered the Paella), we were all stuffed... although, I guess I can't speak for the homeless woman. I hope she had enough to eat that night. Our bill was about 75 quid. Not too shabby for a nice restaurant on the Thames. Just be careful not to offer leftovers to anyone until they're actually packed in the doggy bag.*hah, and you were annoyed that you couldn't give establishments half stars on Yelp.** my .5 friend. Not because she's .5 of a person but because I never got her name.*** ok fine, the rule #1 rule while consuming yummy food is NO TALKING.",

    "text": "I must say that I was a little disappointed by Las Iguanas. The food isn't horrible, it's just that it's nothing special at all. If I didn't know better ( not that I do know better ) I would have said that the meals are pre-packed ready meals shipped in and re-heated. For starters I had chorizo braised in rioja. I cook with chorizo all the time at home, being a fan of Spanish cooking and I know that it has tones of flavour. The sauce I had didn't taste much of chorizo or the wine, and should be rich with the taste of both. The starter was \"nice\" but nothing else. I could cook this at home much better. For mains I had the Xim Xim chicken. The chicken was pale white and slightly rubbery - in fact exactly like you would find in a ready meal. The dish described as lime chicken in a peanut/crayfish sauce didn't taste of lime or cray fish or peanuts. The sauce was creamy slightly peanutty. Again, not unpleasent, but not at all great. I have had better ready meals. The green beans I had were raw. Don't get me wrong, I am not one of these boil the veg to death brits. I love my veggies to have crunch and texture, but there is is that and there is raw - my veg was raw. My desert was passion fruit cheese cake which was actually very nice. However, I wouldn't go out to have a meal somewhere for the cheese cake. The staff were business like and professional. They did the job and nothing more. Just like the food. It seems like getting the job done is enough and going the extra mile is not required. The music was far too loud like the place is trying to hard to pretend to be something it's not. I can't see myself going to Las Iguanas again - the food is bland and I have to shout to be heard.",

Specialising in Latin food and drinks, it has an amazing menu which contains everything you may want from bar snacks (nachos are excellent) and a variety of tapas to delicious main meals (ranging from an amazing brazilian curry to tender steaks and lamb), all at a reasonable price. Best of all is the fantastic cocktail list (the caipirinhas are fabulous) and the fact that on the 5 or 6 occasions I have been, I have always managed to get a table without more than a 10-15 minute wait.

    "text": "Came here with a friend while down in London the other week, looking to have a drink and a few things to snack on at the same time. The Nachos (Around \u00a35) were a few chips scattered loosely across the wide white plate. They tasted dry and papery. Some were covered in a thick layer of cheese that had the texture of dried glue and didn't really taste of anything at all. In the middle of plate was a pot where watery canned tomato seeped together with cream and a vague green paste that would be difficult to call guacamole. \u00a0The Calamari (also around $5) were equally disappointing. There were four or five small squid which just about covered a (thankfully) smaller plate but still seemed to be taunting our hunger with how few they were. They shared the nachos overwhelming impression of being turned in a microwave until they were warm and slightly soggy. The squid itself was overly chewy so that it stretched out and tasted much like an elastic band when you tried to bite into it. In keeping with their seaside origin they had been rolled around in what tasted like sand - small, grainy breadcrumbs that didn't add any crispness. Only by rolling them around until they were covered in the mayonnaise could you get them to taste of anything at all. \u00a0Service was poor too. After a good ten minutes gazing around, at the start eventually I got up myself to collect some menus. There were plenty of staff running about but nobody made any effort to come to us. I then had to get up again to get somebody's attention to order, only to be told that if you sat outside you had to order at the bar. And then I got up a third time because no napkins were brought out with our two finger food dishes.",

    "text": "Had dinner here on a summery Friday evening. Here's a list of my impressions, in timeline form. - Crow-ded! And nobody's eating. Hope there's seats outside and that the food is good. - Wow, I can barely wiggle to my table, it's so close to the neighbouring ones! - Ooooh! Lots of cocktails. And tortilla chips. Yummy homemade tortilla chips. More please! - Cute waiter. Spanish. (not latin american -their pronunciation differs-. I am very slightly amused) Very nice, and fairly efficient, if in slight headless chicken mode. - Hmm.. Enchiladas or Quesadillas... Enchilada it is! Not rolled at the ends, it makes for an impressive length on my plate. But surrounded as it is in refried beans, it looks like a wooden log floating in a pool of s*. Nonetheless very very good :) - Eating the enchilada I accumulate an onion-bhaji-worthy hill of onion pieces. (I don't like eating too much onion, the flavour's too strong) A tad much, perhaps? - Hill of rice under enchilada is very rich... in uncooked or overcooked rice grains. My teeth hurt and I need to return items from my mouth to the plate somewhat ungracefully. - We dined so late, that I'm still hungry. As a result, the desserts menu intrigues me. There is a chocolate pot that mentions kahlua and mocha custard... I drool, then order. It looks like a glass full of chocolate mousse, but it's much better than that. Me and the boyfriend have a spoon battle in the glass for the most chocolate. NOM! - Waiting for the bill and for paying the bill takes a while, and given the sun has disappeared over the embankment, the chilliness is a potent reminder of wanting to move. Overall: good food, great dessert, average speed service. Cocktails: \u00a36, Enchilada \u00a310, Fajitas \u00a314 (not that much meat, and they hide the veg under it!) Desserts \u00a35. (roughly) Highlight: Location, location, location. Benefiting from delicious sunset light, this place has excellent outdoor seating for chatty summery afternoons. I would never come back here unless it was to sit outside, soak up some sun, and watch the people walk by.",

Having said that, there were some interesting Brazilian curries on the menu which I've not seen beforeWe had missed the value tapas deal and ordered a selection of starters to share - nachos, calamares (deep fried squid), gambas (prawns) and champinones (mushrooms in chilli and tomato sauce).While the nachos and calamares were quite generic, the gambas and champinones had some kick, which was niceFro main course, the salmon moqueca was a creamy coconut curry, which was quite mild but flavoursome. My cordero - lamb rump - was a bit disappointing as I couldn't really taste the coriander and parsley rub nor the papaya in my salsa. My friend's spring chicken was nicely roasted but served with cold vegetables. The steak fajita was quite genericThe banoffee pie was passable but not enough banana! I did enjoy a virgin apple mojito while my friends shared a nice south American merlot.I did enjoy my evening here but this may not be the most authentic Latin American food you'll find in London.A last bonus was that we spotted Juan Martin del Potro dining here. He's the current men's US Open tennis champion from Argentina",

We took advantage of a cocktail pitcher to go with dinner for 3 of us. By the time we'd poured the whole jug out we'd barely filled each glass 2/3 full. Woah there, easy on that ice!As for the food, not bad at all, but the portions were stingy. We got some loaded nachos to share and a quesadilla before our mains thinking they'd tide us over. They really didn't and we'd seen them off within 2mins. No joke. My burger seemed like it'd had grown up in a White Castle yet my friend's risotto was about right. The other entree ordered was again on the small side. It's a shame we had to stock up on popcorn afterwards at the IMAX!I've also been here after work on a Friday just for drinks and it has a good atmosphere, especially in the warmer months when you can stand outside. I'm afraid that's all i'll be returning for; not the restaurant.",

But if you can brave the crowds by the doors taking advantage of the 2-4-1 happy hour in the bar area, you'll find a pretty decent restaurant inside.We only had a half hour wait, which gave us plenty of time to enjoy margaritas and caipirinhas (2-4-1 of course) under the umbrellas outside by the South Bank. Service was good all night, considering how busy they were.The food is so much better than I thought! I was expecting grubby Mexican or half-assed Spanish food. Oh no! Featuring mostly Brazilian dishes, almost all of their options are HEALTHY and delicious. I had grilled chicken, which came with roasted sweet potato and squash pieces, roasted grape tomatoes, and a handful of rocket, plus a choice of sauce (tons of different types of salsa to choose from). I had the papaya mint salsa... MMMMMMMMMMMM. Warning: their guacamole has sour cream in it. Told you Larissa D!Anyway, if you happen to be in the area, say, to catch a gig at Heaven just over Waterloo Bridge, then give Las Iguanas a try. Es muy bueno.",

The happy hour accounts for the aforementioned smartarses, but the restaurant has a wholly different feel to it. You are well looked after and the menu is varied, interesting and modest in price. There are plenty of options for carnivores, herbivores, and allergy sufferers, and with a much larger space than it first appears, you don't usually need to wait long to be seated.I've been three times now and enjoyed it every time. That said, I'd recommend the full meals over the tapas options, which are slightly lacking in comparison, both taste-wise and value-wise.Before I make up any more words, I'll leave you to see what you make of it.",

Best mushroom fajitas ever, they are delicious beyond reason. Best nachos ever too, they sprinkle some spices on it that are so darn good. Go during happy hour though because their drinks are pretty expensive, but at least you can buy a pitcher and get one free! Their Long Island iced teas are simply the best. Amazing Latin playlist too, and cool decor. Go here.",

I headed here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised by the lunch menu with main meals at just \u00a36.90 - a bargain for the portion of chilli, rice, tortillas and tortilla chips that I got. Until 7pm there is also Buy one get one free on cocktails which I urge you to take advantage of. The bar service we got was hardly with a smile though, I think we caught the barman on a very bad day. He prepared the wrong drink and when we made reference to it he threw the drink (and almost the glass) at the sink with not a word of explanation. With that aside, the food was good. It took a while to come out, but we were served with tortilla chips and guacamole while we waited. Do note though that as this is a busy chain there is a 1.5 hour limit on the tables so don't expect to while away the afternoon here.",

I always hate writing terrible reviews but nothing really came together for my party the other evening at Las Iguagnas. The starters were anything but fresh and the salsa puts jarred off license salsa to shame. All the street food is not as processed as tex mex but lacked any real flavor and I would have to say we tried both Brazilian curries and it tasted like the curry special at your local pub. I have no other way to say it, poor service and disappointing.",

It's a good choice for meeting before an arts event in the South Bank Centre, too. It's very large, with many dozens of tables inside, with shiny new decor. Outside are several tables too, with the occasional rumble of trains above your head leaving Charing Cross station. They have good deals on during their noon-7pm happy hour. Several cocktails are 2 for 1, house wines are a few pounds cheaper, and there are several meal deals. The food and drink menu is extensive. It's all a bit chainy for me, though. The only beer on tap is San Miguel. They have several bottles. Good because of its location and size, nothing special otherwise.",

IF you opt to sit outside on one of the many heated tables, you have a splendid view of the Southbank. There's a happy hour between 5pm and 7pm, where it's 2-4-1 on the extensive cocktail menu; they've gt pretty much everything you could want, and their Long Island Ice Tea's are fantastic. They serve a vast menu of Southern American dishes, the usual fajitas, jambalaya rice but also some great little tapas dishes, their spiced potato's are very nice. Prices are pretty steep, but given the location you're paying for where you are, as much as what you're ingesting. The vast cocktail menu, and long opening hours means this is a popular spot with those looking for a place to drink on the Southbank, and late into the night the place gets very busy, making it fairly hard to get to the bar. A great place to sit with a friend, having a good old chin wag over cocktails, watching the world go by on the Southbank.",

But maybe it was the food, or it might have been the pleasant environment of the south bank, i have ended up feeling good about this meal.We started off with a pitcher of Long Island iced tea. Now i have had long island at many places, but the muddy colour of the drink here was clearly unique. It tasted good though.The food was menu was a mixture of spanish and portuguese and mexican and brazilian food. I ordered a lamb empanada as a starter. It was pretty much a lamb pasty, though the filling was cooked in a latin american style. Very tasty :)For the main course it was ensopado de carne ... a dish of red goat meat curry and rice. The curry wasn't spicy ... a bit sweetish in fact ... but the combination with the rice worked rather well. I was pleased.The service was good. In spite of it being a big restaurant and very crowded when we went in, we didn't have to wait long for anything.In the line of chains that adorn the south bank centre, this is surely one of the better ones, and at 20 pounds per head, one of the reasonably priced ones.",

    "text": "I usually love Las Iguanas as a chain, but the reason I am not checking in here, in keeping with the theme of the restaurant my phone also had no service. Firstly our booking was mixed up and so they gave away our table. When I proved that we had a booking for 11 at 18.30 not 18.00 they found us a table for 10 and then we had one person standing for 20 mons until they found us another seat. We waited 45 mins for our cocktails which was probably because we were a large order and in the happy hour, but when they arrived they had mixed up the order. Our starters arrived before our drinks and the starters were good, but spicy and the tap water we ordered for the table didnt arrive until after our mains. We had to send three mains back, not inculding the veggy burger they assumed we had ordered, because they had mixed up the style of burger or over-cooked the steak to beyond edible. The staff didn't come to check on us until they finally delivered our water. All in all this is the worst Las Iguanas experience I have ever had. I won't be returning again, but as it is situated in a tourist trap I doubt that would matter. If you are a tourist and thinking of coming here, don't there are more interesting and better places nearby.",

    "text": "We ended up in Las Iguanas when we were looking for food on the Southbank. We were told the wait for a table for two would be half an hour so we grabbed a couple of cocktails at the bar. It always seems busy in Las Iguanas but especially as we went on a Friday night. Cocktails were ok (my friend had a mojito and I had a strawberry dacquiri) but I've had much better for the same price elsewhere. The dacquiri was a little bit sharp for me even though I happily eat slices of lemon! The wait for a table ended up being near to 45mins so we wish we'd ordered nachos to start to eat in the bar first, which a couple next to us had done. When our number came up we were shown to a table and I have to say that I was impressed with the staff. They were friendly and calm despite it being so busy. So often in chain restaurants I find the staff aren't always like this so I really noticed it.We had nachos to start then I had pollo con chorizo and my friend had a burrito. The nachos could have done with a bit more cheese but the guacamole was good and the tortilla crisps were really tasty. My chicken and chorizo was delicious and flavoursome but I would have liked more meat in it and less rice on the side (although I shouldn't really complain about being given too much!). The portion sizes were good and it was reasonable value. My friend enjoyed get burrito but didn't manage to finish it as it was pretty big.I've had tapas here before, but it's better in groups so you can get more variety of dishes. Overall a good chain restaurant. I've not been to South America so can't compare the food for authenticity but it tasted good to me.",

This is the second time I've been here and failed to be impressed. Nothing was terrible and the service was friendly. But the food didn't live up to the fantastic sounding descriptions in the menu - I had a brazilian chicken number which sounded incredible, but turned up looking like a canteen curry and sounded like something i could probably throw together given a can of coconut milk. It was tasty, but I was expecting more - although the pink pickled onions were lovely. My friend had a similar experience. At \u00a313 each those dishes weren't cheap either. The fajitas which went past us looked to be nice and substantial but with Wahaca just down the street and i'd walk the extra few metres: Las Iguanas is mex-lite, I think. \u00a0We only tried one cocktail, the coconut margarita, and it was just plain odd. \u00a0Like 2 different drinks in one. The drinks prices, to be fair, are quite reasonable but the bar space is cramped as the wait for tables can be long. Convenient and by no means terrible but I'd recommend a wander around the South Bank before you commit...",

The wait was ridiculously long and we ended up waiting much longer than we were advised. Usually that's fine as you wait around the bar. However, it was a serious wait to get drinks as it was so packed and congested around the bar. The Englishman raised the issue with the staff who were very courteous and seeing how it was my birthday and we had to wait for soooooooo long, they very kindly offered us happy hour all night. Amazing! 2 for 1 on drinks all night. The drinks at Las Iguanas are delicious! My favourite is the raspberry caiprinhas, what a dream. The food is delicious! Las Iguanas is definitely worth checking out if not for the drinks alone. \u00a0Tip: Check out other locations away from tourist traps for less of a wait to get in. I took a star off because of the wait, but the staff didn't let it ruin our night out and the dining area is a bit too dark for eating.",

I've only been to this branch once and that was enough, because of its location - on the Southbank and close to Waterloo Station - it's always packed and full of tourists and I think the service is slow; surly and pretty poor. The food was okay when I went but nothing to write home about, the drinks especially the cocktails were good but again, there are plenty of other restaurants that deliver more for your money and appetite!",

    "text": "Las Iguanas - how the mighty have fallen. When i first visited, I gave you 4 stars. After many more visits, I gave 5. But after my last 3 visits, you get downgraded to 3. Why? Because you keep changing what is good!Ever since I first started going to Las Iguanas, the hosts/hostess/greeters/whatever you wish to call them have always been crap. Rude, or non-English speaking, or just unavailable. They seem to have gotten worse of late. A few months back I wanted to meet up here for dinner with friends. We had a day and time in mind. So I tried to make reservations. There were 4 in our party. We were told we couldn't book for less than 5 people, but were told that they \"keep 1/3 of the restaurant available for walk-ins\". I called back and fibbed and said we had 5 as we really wanted to make sure we could have a nice night out. Upon arrival we were told they \"needed the table back\" in 1h45m. What?! \u00a0After about an hour (with slow, but polite, service) we kept being reminded that we needed to hurry it along. In the end, we took our drinks and desserts and moved to some empty seats outside. We watched as \"our\" table remained empty for nearly 40 minutes.After that occasion, at the request of my bf's mum, we returned this weekend. Again, I wasn't allowed to book a table for 3. Again I was promised that \"1/3 of the restaurant is kept free.\" We got there and were told by the VERY rude host that there was a table \"right now\" but we had to \"give it back in 1h40m.\" We knew we wanted to have drinks and then dinner, so asked if there was something available later. \"No - I have a table for you now, but we're fully booked the rest of the night.\" I pointed out to him that I was told I couldn't book for less than 5 people. \"That's right,\" he said. \"But you have no space for walk-ins *later*?\" I asked. \"No. You can have the table now, but we're fully booked.\" \u00a0(So much for the \"1/3 open\" policy). We decided this was better than nothing and took the table. When he sat us he told us we now had to be finished in \"1h30m\". It was 30 minutes before we were served our drinks. Hopes were low. In the end, we weren't rushed away. We stayed for just over 2 hours. The restaurant was slow. MANY MANY tables, both small and large, were open when we left. So either we were flat out lied to by the host, or gobs of people cancelled their reservations. The other downfall is the drinks and tapas menus. They keep shrinking and/or the best items disappear or change description greatly. The introduction last year of the taco sharing platter is a great one, but other than that, Las Iguanas on the whole is going downhill. I still enjoy the food. And the waiters and waitresses, while slower than molasses in January, tend to be competent and kind. But the feel of the place isn't the laid back Latin of 3 years ago. It's changed for the worse.",

We had to wait a loooooong time, much longer than advised, but I was impressed that the management recognised this by giving us happy hour all night. And true to form, it was happy all night, as the food was actually really good. The tacos were fantastic and so were the enchiladas. We left merry and drunk for a very reasonable price. Four stars.",

    "text": "Got dragged here last night by our cousins for 'dinner and drinks'. I think the two for one cocktails may have been the main attraction. The experience itself wasn't too bad, our waitress was really super nice and they gave free cake and sung happy birthday to birthday cuz. The hostess who greeted us wasn't great. First she told us there were no tables available for 45 minutes. When she 'found' us a table, which she led us through a half empty dining room to get to, she 'double checked' that we were eating, and said we'd have to vacate the table in two hours. Not great service. The food and drink are awful. The menu is a kind of mash up of Cuban, Brazilian and Mexican-inspired food, but there's always something a bit weird about each dish. Like fish tacos with sweet chilli sauce rather than lime and coriander. The cocktails were weak and tasted of washing up liquid, making the two for one deal slightly less enticing. The food was really expensive for the quality. \u00a315 for chicken fajitas and you have to pay extra for cheese. I just had a salad as the least offensive thing on the menu. It was \u00a310 and was mainly just leaves. I wouldn't go here again.",

Felt like I was picking from the leftovers. \u00a0Should have been a sign to get up and go...and the food took very long to get out. think 45 minutes, to the point, we had to tell the server, that other tables were here later and they were served already. \u00a0When the food arrived, omg.. I swear Taco Bell or frozen tacos would have tasted better. We barely nibbled on our and had enough... \u00a0 When we finally got our check.. we were charged 10% or 12% of service charge. \u00a0I think I should have asked to see a manager and bring this to his/her attention, but I am simply too exhausted.

Another ten mins passed until the correct beer showed up. At this point, we had waited so long to eat that my 1 year old daughter was supremely grouchy. Rather than irritate the other customers with a screaming infant, I asked for my food to be boxed, so I could leave early. \u00a0Simply boxing my food took 10 mins, all the while my daughter screamed, and annoyed the other customers.

It massive once you go downstairs, and we got given a really nice table in the corner, plenty of space for a good convo and not to get squashed.The food was ridiculous! So good! We both got fajitas.. I was craving seafood, so I went for the prawns and she chose the chicken. Both were cooked to perfection. They were served with salsa, guac, jalape\u00f1oes \u00a0and sour cream. The salsa wasn't my favourite, but the rest were delicious. Drinks wise, I was feeling a cocktail, but my friend was sick so lead the way and ordered red wine, so I was tempted to join. I got a juicy Malbec, which was light and easy to drink. She opted for the Rioja, which was a bit more spicy.All in all, so impressed by this place. I can't wait to come back and check out more of the menu.",

    "text": "Las iguanas is one of those chains that I visit, like and then don't go again for ages, simply because there's so many other places to go to. However I was quite happy to get the chance to go again, as I mentioned it to my colleagues and they agreed (they know by now that my obsession with yelp is here to stay).Anyway, we went in, got seated and ordered our drinks. I do have to mention that one of my colleagues got a dirty (kinda mouldy) cup that we returned. The staff apologised about it and mentioned that it happens some times. It has not happened to me before but ok... Nevertheless, we ordered our food and it came shortly after. I had the chicken burrito from the lunch menu and the mushroom starter. The mushrooms were great but the chicken in the burrito was a bit dry. I did feel quite full afterwards and only paid about \u00a39 for the food so it is quite good value for money, even if the quality has room for improvement. My colleagues who had the half chicken said its not as good as Nando's and the really spicy one was not as spicy as they thought but still good value for money in terms of portion sizes.Since I personally have had a good experience with the venue in the past I would like to think that the few mishaps of this visit were an exception and I would go back again, but in general I think wagamama is a better alternative.If you are in the area I would recommend their cocktail happy hour but there are some better places to go for food.",

    "text": "A cousin was visiting London and we decided to hit the Udderbelly festival and then dine at Las Iguanas. I booked us a table for 8:30 and we had to wait a good 10-15 minutes before we got a table. While waiting, we had to actually go ask 2 times and even though the table was ready we weren't called.Decent cocktails...they have quite a few options. Liked the ones with cahaca (of course!) and though El Presidente looked like it would be good one, it was strictly ok. Food was great. We had tapas for starters..loved the prawns and the calamari. Their ciabatta with the gambas reminded me of pao from back home.The mains were good as well. The Xinxim was a huge portion, while the sea bass and chicken were more one-person portions. Lovely aromas and delicious comforting food.We got nice window-side seats at the corner. Nice place. Service at the table was good.",

    "text": "I've been to Las Iguanas before and although the food isn't amazing you can't go wrong with a burrito or fajitas! Also their cocktail menu is good although all are very sweet!Recently went for dinner with 3 friends and was quite impressed with the menu. There had been a lot of change and lots of tasty looking things. My friends both had chilli; one beef and one pumpkin. Both enjoyed however I don't think it is anything to shout about. I had a roasted butternut squash, cheese and spinach enchiladas which was really nice. Came with refried beans (wahacas are better) and quite bland rice. We also shared cassava fries. Ok but would go for sweet potato fries or plantain next time! Overall a nice evening - we sat outside on a Friday evening so nice ambience. The service was quite slow however we were in no rush so it was fine.Would return with a group of friends if craving Mexican however there are other restaurants in London I would pick over this!",

The only weird/interesting part of our meal was the guacamole we had to assemble ourselves Not usual nyc style that we've seen but it was alright. Not a big fan of it to be honest. Wouldn't order the guac again. But everything else was good! Drinks were decent we went during happy hour so good price",

(Thanks, but no thanks.)The inside has a Latin theme, but the decor reminds me of a big chain restaurant so to be honest it didn't appeal to me. There is also a large seating area outside that I'm sure would be lovely in the summertime.Anyway their USP for me is happy hour. 2 for 1. Honestly I can't complain about 2 for 1, so I would definitely return!",

    "text": "This is a great spot for a Birthday treat, even better if you signed up for their mailing list!I was taken here the other week and treated by my girlfriend for my Birthday. We were looking for a place close to Southbank that would eb a bit exotic. Las Iguanas fit that criteria perfectly. I am a fan of Mexican food, but never had the opportunity to sample Brazillian food so I was excited for this. There didn't seem to be any reservations but we left my phone number and they called within 15 minutes saying a table was held for us. We are led into the ever expanding interior that is so much larger than outside appearances.We start the evening with a cocktail jug (purple zombie or something similar sounding). We share Pato Taquito and Chicken Wings as starters which are small but increibly powerful in taste. This was followed by Camarao a la Criolla (Prawns in) for my girlfriend and I chose the Cordero (boneless lamb in sweet orange and tamarind glaze).This meal was incredible.Portion size was reasonable but not what would be considered enormous. But what they lacked in size was instead replaced by overall tastes and aromas. The conbinations of flavours on the lamb was amazing. I do not usually choose lamb, but they were cooked perfectly, soft, and very juicy. To top off the night, I remembered that I have been to Las Iguanas for lunch last year and joined their email newsletter. I had received an email for my Birthday wishing me a Happy Birthday and a free main meal! So with that significnat discount to the total meal we leave feeling like we have incredible value for money and a very pleasant experience. In terms of atmosphere, the restaurant on the Southbank is obviously very busy and this created a great lively mood for a Thursday evening.To conclude, we were treated to great cocktails, great starts, even better Brazilian main courses and a free main course for my Birthday!I enjoyed the meal so much, I have started my fitness campaign to join the GB Olympic squad so I get a free trip to Rio in 2016!!",

    "text": "We tried the south bank London on a Wednesday for some food now Being a lover of picky teas we always opt for the taps selection and it never fails to disappoint however the reason behind the 3 stars is simple the venue is too small to host happy hours on cocktails and serve food. After you India jones your way through the very large crowed bar to try and attempt to make your way to the table you are then left with either a rock hard chair to sit on or a well padded seat, We tend to pick 5 tapas and and extraSide so 6 dishes at the most by time these are places on your table with the twoSide plates the candle the menus the salt and pepper and your glass of whatever, you literally find those Tetris skills coming into good use. This is also avoiding people's bums bumping your table as they pass you. We also had to wait 45 mins to be served our food and 30 mins to be served our pudding which we didn't take any chances and asked for the bill straight Away before the service team disappeared forAnother 40mins. On top of all this you also have the noise from trains from the above line/ station running over head in competition with the music they try to lay to drowned it out. In a nutshell if you don't mind a dead bum a constant rhythm of boom boom boom and a very popular buy one get one free cocktail then this is your place.",

    "text": "I visited Las Iguanas with two friends to celebrate my birthday and had a disappointing experience. The kitchen had lost its gas supply so a limited menu was on offer - however I won't hold this against the restaurant as they did warn us beforehand and were still able to offer a good range of dishes.Unfortunately when we received our food (I had the vegetarian burrito), it was both dry and bland - a far cry from the wholesome, tasty comfort food we were looking for at Las Iguanas. In addition the service was poor - our drinks did not arrive for a long time, and when we asked the serving staff for our cocktails, we were told our order had been lost..Overall not a great experience, and I'll probably choose an alternative chain next time I'm looking for Mexican / Brazilian comfort food.",

    "text": "I travel to London frequently to visit family, and Las Iguanas on Royal Festival Hall is a must-go every time I visit. Right next to the London Eye and with a fantastic view of Big Ben and Parliament, the location itself is a must for anyone who's visiting the UK.As a small chain, each location of Las Iguanas has this fun, beachy, 60's inspired ambiance that makes eating there an experience. While the decor at the Spitalfield Market is my favorite, this location is cute as well. The restaurant boasts an extensive and delicious selection of margaritas (the coconut one is my personal favorite) as well as a menu that appeals to both meat-eaters and vegetarians. I eat meat; however, I always opt for the butternut squash enchiladas. Each dish is quite filling on its own; however, I would recommend splitting some appetizers with your dining guests (you can either select three starters for 15 pounds or five for 24 pounds). I must say that the menu has changed since I started eating at Las Iguanas. Their \"Cha Cha Chorizo\" was a fantastic starter, and has since been eliminated from the menu.Overall, an affordable, aesthetically-pleasing Mexican restaurant that will \u00a0leave you satiated and satisfied.",

To me that sounded like an avocado and cilantro feast so I was defenitely up for it.I passed the time with a classic Margarita until our party was complete and then craved the Cranberry & Avocado Salad. Sprinkled with candied almonds, the salad was a bit too heavy and sweet. Although there wasn't much on the plate, I didn't feel the need to finish it up.My friends were happy with their Mexican comfort food and although I prefer smaller, more unique restaurants, I might come again some day.",
