They use excellent rice (traditional korean rice rather than californian grown japanese rice), and a medley of vegetables (including the essential obscure Korean ones) with a bit of meat thrown in for flavour and texture. \u00a0I never order other dishes here (aside from an occasional noodle soup which uses instant noodles in a hot beef broth) and wouldn't bother -- this is a canteen and they excel on the low-end of the spectrum.Don't come here for BBQ or with friends for a big night out. \u00a0It's somewhere for lunch, and a bloody good one if you like bibimbap. \u00a0The service is great, and when I used to work nearby they would start my bibimbap as soon as they saw me walking towards the restaurant -- its that kind of spot.I used to go there sometimes after work for beers because I kind of like that korean lager Hite and once one of the dudes there and I got so drunk he spoke to me in Korean. Only in Korean, despite me not understanding any korean.",

    "text": "I dragged my parents with me to Naru restaurant since I love korean food so much and miss eating it. Overall the food tastes pretty good!We ordered Dak gan jung which is a deep fried chicken with a sauce, Jap chae which is stir fried potato noodles with vegetables, Kal bu gi (beef short ribs), Dol sor bibimbab and Kimchi jji gae (kimchi soup). The best dish there has to be the deep fried chicken where the chicken is so tender inside but crispy on the outside. The only downside was that there's a little bit too much batter (where there's no meat) but I personally love eating those so it was fine for me. My mum's favourite dish has to be the stirred friend potato noodles and I agree with her that it tastes really good as well. The beef short rib was ok but we thought that it was slightly overcooked and not ask tender as it should be. The bibimbap is delicious too but I would prefer to have more korean spicy sauce with it. The kimchi soup was nice as well and I really like the (wholegrain?) rice served with it. The cost of the meal was around \u00a357 and we thought it was worth it since there were lots of food for 3 people (we were really full and satisfied).It was a good experience and we will definitely go back soon!",

There aren't an BBQ stove on the table so all food are cooked in the kitchen.We had Jap Chae for starter... which is transparent noodles with finely sliced veg and seaseme seeds sprinkled on top. It was mouth watering... as we were very hungry, we wanted it to be a bigger portion!! The bimbimbap was amazing too! We all got one each and were happy that we didn't have to share it. The table next to ours requested to meet the chef as they enjoyed it so much! He was SO young... early 20s! We were all very surprised that a young chef like him can cook such brilliant food.When we were due to pay, we asked the waitress about this young chef. She told us that he's not the main chef as the main chef is on holiday, and vowed that the main chef is 10x better than him... I was shocked as the meal was very very good! I would highly recommend this place but if you're looking for traditional BBQ at your table... this is not the place to go. Otherwise the food & services are thumbs up!",

Our order consisted of:Bulgogi - thin slices of beef marinated in a soy sauce baseSoondubu - seafood and tofu in a spicy brothMackerel with citrus sauce - exactly as describedKimchi - spicy pickled napa cabbage (still sad that this requires ordering in London and isn't a given at the table)Kimchi was all right. Bulgogi was standard fare, served on a bed of onions that had been cooked with the meat. Satisfied the craving. Soondubu was unexpectedly rich (I had had low expectations) in flavor, which was great. Not bland, and not too spicy. Just enough kick to complement the meat. Mackerel was a little different from how it's usually prepared. The ingredients were traditional, but they're not usually used together. Sauce was a little strong. Liked it better after scraping some of the sauce off.",

One of my party members asked the staff if they were open and she mumbled something, went back to setting tables and said 5 minutes without acknowledging us. This is unfortunate as they began greeting customers in Korean whilst giving us the horrid treatment. It took all four of us to get their attention for 10 minutes to order. Drinks came in really slowly despite being one of two tables. When our food was finally served, a waitress spilt a glass of water all over my possessions and cracked my phone screen. She slowly proceeded to clean up and unapologetically apologised. However, the food was good but no amazing, korean pancakes were better than the average and the spicy pork was perfect. Spicy pork with calamari was kinda op considering it was 4 pieces of calamari and way less pork than ordering just spicy pork. To my surprise, paying was not a nightmare. Overall, they would have received a 3, maybe 4 but the service was so poor, so poor.",

I've been to Naru a couple of times and I've got to say that it's pretty good. They need to improve on a few things for me to give them a 5th star though.For one, Korean restaurants typically give you complimentary side dishes with your meal. Maybe I'm spoiled from California where I'm used to this, but when I stopped by Korea, they seemed to do the same thing. Naru gives you nada! Secondly, they seem to be a little skimpy on the portions. I ordered this ramen street dish with rice cakes and stuff in it, although it was delicious, I still was hungry afterwards...Other than those reasons, Naru does Korean really well. Everything I've tried is pretty good, I just wish I got more of it. Service isn't horrible, but it does get busy in there.",

The things one does for friendship. On the whole, the meal was really yummy. To start we ordered a side of Kimchi and Ttuk San Juk - Skewers of beef, rice cake and veggies. Heavenly, delectable little bites, perfect in number for 2 people to share.When we first arrived I had thought it would be a great idea to order a bottle of Soju. Realised after a single shot, that I In fact, do not like Soju. Thankfully had level-minded friend present to not let me go crazy on the menu. Back to the food - Next I had the O Jing a Bokkum, which consisted of Calamari (no tentacles, unfortunately which are obviously the best bit) and this delicious, albeit spicy sauce. Only downside that I can think of was that they served it with courgettes which I abhor. The calamari was cooked really nicely, and with the sauce in tow made for a fabulous midnight snack. Did I mention they really don't skimp on the portions? My friend has the braised pork (Naru Bo Ssam) which was too sweet for me, but cooked to perfection nevertheless. All of the above came to about 40 quid, which considering London prices was really not too awful. Would love to come here again, perhaps with slightly hungrier friend.",

Haha It was just the overall vibe I got.The food here was amazing! Best seafood pan cake I have ever had! Better than all the Korean places I've eaten at in new york and new jersey back in the states! How do they do it? Maybe it's because I prefer it slightly crispy as most other places make it soggy. That or, you really do value your food more when the portions are smaller than what I'm uesd to.We also got the bibimbap and a pork with calamari. Very delicious and on point. The lady mixed our Bibimbap for us and took extra care to get it perfect. Great Korean dining experience for sure and I can't wait to come back for the other yummies on their menu.",

It really is quite unique by itself and offers a wide array of meals for both the newbies and experienced in the Korean food. The Bibimbap is amazing here - so full of taste and dense in flavour. I think that everyone should at leaest once in their life try Korean beef and BBQ in general. There is no other culture that prepares the meat this well - it's uniquely tasty.I can make a small remark regarding the staff. The place seemed to be a bit short of people as we waited for some time for our orders and check respectively. However, that did not ruin our dinner at all; and what could actually, with such food.",

It isn't outstanding, but if you want a solid Korean meal, attentive service, a quiet and warm atmosphere, and good prices, this is your joint. They accept my dietary substitutions/requests on the soon doo boo (extra spicy, no seafood, sub kimchi) with no qualms (unlike Asadal), which makes me very happy! But sadly, just like every other Korean restaurant in London*, they charge for banchan. As an LA girl, this is a joke to me. I will never understand it. *Exception: Tohbang on Clerkenwell doesn't charge for the first round of banchan!",

I also ordered the tobboki (rice cakes) which was a disappointing portion. At almost \u00a38 a portion, there were about 5 rice cakes and the (already small) plate was bulked up with vegetables. The Pae jeon (seafood pancake) was also disappointing. The pancake wasn't crispy, and was really thick and tasted like uncooked batter in the middle. To top it all off, they charged us \u00a31 a head for cake service- on top of service charge- which I think is a really mean spirited thing to do. Towards 10.30 they started hurrying us to settle the bill and leave. Unacceptable. The bibimbap was good, although I don't think it's enough to make me want to come back..",

(Although way overpriced...it's only about 2.50 a bottle in seoul and it was 8 pounds here..) Anyways, we ordered our food and appetizer, and I received my Makulay in a cute carafe. Darth Vader reared his ugly head as our waiter brought us tiny glasses of water.Empire Strikes Back: Holy shit was the ttokboki (i'm not spell checking that. go to h) amazing. It compared to or surpassed the street vendors in Seoul. We started to receive our meals. My dining mates' dishes were exceptional, and galaxy saving was in full swing, but then Boba Fett was eaten by the Sarlacc. In other words, I was a bit annoyed because my Mackeral was completely unappealing and average compared to these other dishes. Also our waiter had no idea what we ordered and tried giving me bi bim bap that I didn't order. Return of the Jedi: So we're finishing our meals and overall enjoying everything, but then the ewoks showed up and made me scratch my head. 2 pounds for extra rice? It was at this point I realized that this was THE ONLY KOREAN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN AT THAT DID NOT COME WITH COMPLEMENTARY KIMCHI.Let me repeat that.THE ONLY KOREAN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN AT THAT DID NOT COME WITH COMPLEMENTARY KIMCHI.Kimchi was on the menu for 3 pounds. Wut. Get the hell out of here dude. The fact that meals that obviously should have been served with rice then didn't come with kimchi is a nail in the coffin.Then we received our bill. This was like George Lucas adding Hayden Xtianson as Anakin's ghost. Nah dog.1.)

    "text": "Difficult to call on the accuracy of the cooking, I'm not a regular eater of Korean, which, considering the delicious menu I'm faced with, surprises me. I think that there's a trick missed in my dining life. A selection of stews, fried dishes, noodle dishes and the phrase I'm looking for, dolsot bibimbap, a (relatively) healthy dish served in a roasting hot stone bowl that I'm relying on to take away my Monday evening blues. Authentic or not, there's little else I recognise on the menu, often one of the best benchmarks for authenticity. A larger than expected portion of 'Crunch Chicken' sweetly and oddly tastes just like a gourmet version of a McDonald's Chicken McNugget. Noticeably sugared flesh beneath a light battered coating, it's surprising and not at all unpleasant, in a guilty pleasure sort of way. There's definitely a food dude marketing angle in this, it'd sell like, well hot chicken, in an East End foodie market. Come to think of it, I might try and get in there before anyone else notices! The obligatory side of kimchi, fermented and chilli infused cabbage, is a welcome contrast (if a little cold) cutting through the chicken and giving a needed contrast in texture.The main event, that dolsot bibimbap, is enough to make me kick myself for not having it more often. It's a superb piece of simple cooking with some wonderful flavour and texture contrasts. Small piles of steamed and fragrant veggies are placed adjacent to each other for contrast, alongside a healthy portion of beef slivers, atop a bed of plain rice. The stone bowl, boiling hot from the oven, has been coated with sesame oil before being filled and the smell is outstanding. An egg yolk completes the dish, stirred into the browning, crispening rice and coating the meat and vegetables, cooking as it does to give the whole dish a light yellow sesame scented sheen. Cut through with more of that kimchi, this is truly a heartening and hearty winter dish. The FoH team are friendly and unobtrusive, the decor is inoffensively pale, a mid range fairly generic Asian restaurant that could be anywhere or serving anything. It's not overly designed, but is functional and very comforting, like the food. Just round the back of the Shaftesbury Theatre, you're not going to find it on any glitzy hit lists, but that won't stop me going back and shouldn't stop you going, assuming you haven't already been.",

The menu has a great selection of appetizers, meats, soups, rice and noodles etc., which all feature some homey and familiar Korean dishes.My friend and I got the japchae, teokbokki, seafood pancake and the bibimbab. The seafood pancake was pretty big. There were three portions and I liked that it was hot and crispy on the edges when it was brought to our table. The bibimbab was pretty flavorful but I wished there was more beef in it. The teokbokki was delicious! It's perfectly spiced and tasted like it was homemade. I loved the cabbage that went with this dish too because it had soaked up all the flavors from the sauce. The japchae was probably my favorite out of everything. It was so delicious with some earthy flavors, colorful vegetables and shredded egg whites on top. The noodles had a new chew to it too!For beverages, my friend and I both got some Asahi. You can't go wrong with beer and Korean food! The total bill came out to be ~\u00a350 for everything, which is definitely more pricey than what I'm used to. I wouldn't say the portions were particularly large either. Overall, Naru isn't the cheapest place for Korean food but it's a great place for some tasty, homey and well prepared Korean food. I'll be back!",

Long story short. \u00a0If you want a real Korean food experience and not sure what to expect don't go here. \u00a0 The owners should just build the ban Chan price into the other dishes and teach the waitresses how to anticipate basic things such as people needing rice.",

ALL VERY GOOD!#26 Bulgogi ... Slices of beef was soft and very tasty with sweet soy source. \u00a0#27 Yangnyeom Chicken ... This is the BEST one, crispy fried chicken dipped in a sweet spicy source. It's MUST item if you are chicken lover!#28 Sundubu jjigae ... We like Sundubu and had several ones in the past, but this one was the BEST one for our liking. Soup was not too spicy but has a lot of umami taste in it, and small squids are really good! It also comes with steamed rice (it's good also).#41 Haemul bookeum udong ... We asked to make it \"non-spicy\" as we don't like too hot dishes. It has a lot of seafood (Mussels, Oysters, Squids, Shrimps etc.) and very tasty stir-fried noodle. You'd better considering to order couple of dishes as a starter to be shared, as all dishes are relatively in smaller size (compared with US one). Also you need to take enough time into account as it takes time to be cooked (probably by one chef?). BTW, typical Korean restaurant in California comes with multiple small dishes as an appetizer (Namuru, Kimuchi etc.), but you need to order them here.Anyway, all dishes are soo good and atmosphere was very nice for small family like us to talk and enjoy tasty dishes without being bothered by a loud noisy music or too much crowded environment in a busy touristic area. There is no stress here so you can relax and enjoy time with family!",

Fortunately it is not located on the same road as what use to be known as London mini Korean street, so it hasn't been affected by the centre point and crossrail regeneration.When you come to Naru I recommend their soup pot which is served with steamed rice. But unusual that it was multigrain rice or what is known as black and white rice on their menu.A favourite soup pot of mine is Kimchi jjigae (\u00a38.50) which consist of spicy kimchi, sliced pork and tofu. It is one of the traditional Korean soup pot that goes well with rice and this spicy soup which is suited for the colder season.Naru's Kimchi jig was good as the soup was not too watery and more like a stew. There was a good amount of thinly sliced pork and tofu. The portion size was just right for one person.There is a small selection of casserole which are larger version of the soup pot and is serving for 2-3 people. These do not include rice but for additional charge you can add rice, ramen noodle or potato glass noodle to go with the casserole.The kimchi, sliced pork and dumpling stew is one of the casserole which can be served for 1 person (\u00a313). The only thing missing from this was tofu otherwise it would had truly satisfy for my tofu loving friend.If you not a fan of having a soup pot then there are a lot of other traditional Korean dishes inlcuding Dolsot bibimbap and par jeon which are not bad. But it would not be my first choice at Naru.",

The location isn't all that great since it's on a corner and doesn't get the best publicity, which might explain why it wasn't that crowded when I visited.I ordered the tofu bibimbap (no egg) and ended up really liking it. The tofu tasted great and had a good texture, and I enjoyed the vegetables/rice (mixed grain) as well. The vegetables did seem a bit oily, though, hence the minus one star. But overall, a solid meal, and for a reasonable price too - I believe I paid around 7 pounds for the bibimbap, which was more than enough for lunch.",

We also had the pa jeon kim chi pancake which was good. \u00a0Crispy on the outside with a nice golden colour. The BBQ dishes went down a treat. We had the Bul go gi and the spicy pork. \u00a0 Both were really tasty. The bi bim bap was ok. It wasn't as flavoursome as I had hoped and it tasted a bit bland. The two best things we ordered were the yang nyum dak fried chicken and the kim-chi, sliced pork & dumpling stew. The fried chicken pieces were perfectly crispy and tossed in a sweet and sour sauce. Everyone kept referring to this as Korean popcorn chicken. Delicious! And the stew came with a burner to keep it bubbling away in the table. Loads of veg in a spicy broth. The dumplings were yummy. Overall a great meal at Naru. Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere and it was great value. We gorged ourselves and it came out at only \u00a325 per person.",

I have been to Korea twice, and i can tell the food is not authentic at all, at least the ones i ordered, which are the deep fried chicken starter and a beef rib stew as main. The chicken tastes like junk food, like you got in a fast food place for 3 dollars. The crisp is not what they usually use in Korea. The beef rib is huge, can they just cut it in smaller piece? The plate for the stew is so shabby, a plain, white ceramic plate, which is not what they use for a stew. And this stew, goes without rice, charged 14 pounds. But the most ridiculous thing of this \" restaurant\" is that they have 12% service charge. Com'on, all they did is adding tap water one time. And 12%? Excuse me? Am i \u00a0eating at a fancy reataurant or am i in the States now? Three of us, spend 42 pounds, eating Korean fast food. Sorry i don't get it. And no thank you, never again.",

After scouring a number of reviews my eyes fell upon which seemed to have relatively good reviews. I had the bibimbap in a stone bowl which was really quite delicious! The stone was hot enough to create some really crispy pieces of rice. The taste of sesame oil and red pepper paste flooded my mouth with joy. Aside from being a bit stunned that kimchi and namul had to be paid for (they are complimentary in Korean restaurants in Korea, Canada and the States), the portions were good for these and they tasted fresh and delicious.Finally I also had the kalbi which had a bit of an unusual appearance it was like they took the tong kalbi (the traditional cut) and sliced it into a long strip which they cut up into pieces and served in a heated marinade pool. I wish it was truly grilled as the charcoal flavour was missed. It wasn't my favourite version of the dish but hit the spot. Afterall who would turn down kalbi?",

Haha, must be natural ordering skill. Naru lived up to the recommendations we had been given and we were treated to some tasty dishesI'm afraid my poor memory and lack of familiarity with Korean food means that I can't summarise all rhe dishes that we enjoyed. However, I can remember that my favourite dishes were the beef tartare, sweet yet fragrant than sesame and perfectly paired with pear, and the japchae, sweet potato noodlesI haven't been overly enamoured by Korean food in the past but Naru has inspired me to explore this cuisine more in the future",
