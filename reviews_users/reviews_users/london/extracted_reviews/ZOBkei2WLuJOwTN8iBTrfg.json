    "text": "Stax isn't a fancy restaurant this is a laid back, relaxed diner where you can enjoy some traditional Southern food. It was really busy when we arrived but we were able to pop on to the end of another table so we didn't have to wait. The seating is like old wooden desks from primary school and they are squished pretty close together but this does add to the buzzy atmosphere of the place.To drink I went for the 'naughty' Passionfruit Cosmo which was very disappointing and didn't even taste like it had any passionfruit in it, I mainly tasted just lime juice but I drank it anyway.I've always wanted to try buttermilk fried chicken so went for The Chickadee which is basically just a chicken burger but I think it's one of the best that I've ever had with two large pieces of chicken packed into the bun. It was too big to eat as one burger so I had to eat it in two open-topped halves. I loved that it wasn't slathered in sauce which so many places seem to do these days but I think it would have been extra awesome with a slice or two of cheese on there as well. It was a huge portion too so I was grateful that I didn't go for a side as well even though I was tempted by the sound of the popcorn shrimp.",

    "text": "I had the opportunity to visit the Kingly Court for a late afternoon snack. It has a nice atmosphere to it: there is a central courtyard surrounded by three levels of restaurants with balconies. The outdoor seating of the ground level restaurants merge into each other like a food court and create an atmosphere. You can look out from the windows of the restaurants above to observe what's happening across the way and below. Stax Diner is an American diner on the 2nd level.I ordered the chicken and waffles which was what originally drew me to bookmark the restaurant. I also asked for a pint of cider to wash it down with. They don't serve cider by the pint, but I could get a bottle for \u00a35.I am a great fan of the idea of chicken and waffles. I mean, who could resist the sweet and savoury combination? However this one felt a bit so-so. The chicken appeared to be of the mass-produced fillet sort and reminded me of the main fast food joints. Nothing wrong with it, but I just felt it wasn't worth the \u00a312 pricing. The waffle and syrup were the best part. The waffle was freshly made and the syrup wasn't over the top sweet.I noticed that they also do a wide range of burgers, sides and milkshakes. The atmosphere was lively, the staff were friendly and it looks like a solid place to have lunch with friends.",

    "text": "Oh my, what a place. I bookmarked Stax off the back of a Twitter review a while back, and finally dragged a friend there last Friday night (he didn't exactly put up much resistance once I'd showed him the menu).As enthusiastic former residents of the good ol' US of A, our expectations of the diners of London are pretty high, and are unfortunately regularly dashed. Luckily, Stax is excellent. Located in the delightful, and miraculously still relatively secret, Kingly Court, it is a long and thin place with some outdoor seating. We did queue for about 5 minutes for our seats (at 7:15ish, so peak time) but that was absolutely fine, as they brought us booze and kept us updated. Despite being seated on the furthest away seats, outside, in the middle of October, we weren't a) cold or b) forgotten about - the staff are attentive and knowledgeable, and made no attempt to get rid of us, which is a real bonus on a Friday night.The burgers are exceptionally tasty - as my friend put it, \"I love it when burgers are so beautifully cooked that they melt in your mouth\". They're miles better than any other burgers I've had recently (and that's a lot). The chips are also delicious, and although we didn't sample the milkshakes or desserts, both looked excellent.In the midst of a lot of mediocre diners in Central London, Stax is a significant cut above the rest.",

    "text": "Caveat - This is only a brunch review.My girlfriends and I headed over to Stax on the weekend before going to Regent's Park for a play. I tend to hate going central during the weekend, \u00a0unless there is a good reason, though seeing how quiet Carnaby Street and Kingly Court can be at noon on a summer Saturday may make me venture out more often.As other diners have noted, Stax doesn't have a big venue but given how quiet it was we were able to snag a table straight away. \u00a0We came with the sole intention of having the half and half which includes half a stack of pancakes and half english muffin with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. Then... I saw the french toast. \u00a0Don't be alarmed - we were able to do a switch and do the Half and Half with the french toast instead of pancakes - and wow, delicious. I'll admit, coming from the States I'm used to gigantic portions at breakfast so was a bit worried when the food came out - but by the end of the delicious meal I could hardly take the final bites. As someone who loves to douse my bacon in maple syrup, I was pleased to get a side order of Maple Streaky Bacon. My girlfriends were megafans, raving about the bacon though I will admit I like my bacon crunchier and more American style - totally depends on your preference.Mimosas at 5 quid a crack are more affordable than a lot of brunch places and were strong and hit the spot. I probably won't venture all the way back central just for brunch again, but will certainly be coming back to try out the dinner menu during the week.",

    "text": "I have such mixed feelings about Stax. We went during the soft opening to give it a try. There was a bit of a wait while we were there, and we asked to get some drinks while we were waiting, but it did take awhile to get them. When we did, they were really good (and STRONG). I had friends that had gone and had told me not to get certain things, but they were so tempting that we did it anyway. Two of us ordered burgers (and made it a double) with bacon and carmelized onions with blue cheese and two of us ordered the chicken and waffles. We also ordered sides of chips, fried pickles and the cajun blooming onion. We also ordered some boozy shakes. We also saw they had a fried green tomato sandwich, and we asked if we could just get a side of them instead of the sandwich, and they said yes.There was a bit of a service mishap, the server seemed really confused and clueless. I know it's a soft opening, but I was kind of hoping that they would be a bit better with it. We didn't end up with one of the burgers and one of the chicken and waffles (but we did re-order them and get them). Also the side of fried green tomatoes became the sandwich and we had a bit of a mishap actually getting the side, but it worked out in the end. I felt bad because it seemed that Bea kept talking to our server about the order at our table.The food was tasty. The fried green tomatoes were AWESOME (and we recommended that they make it into a side as well as the sandwich because they were AMAZING). The onion was great and the chips were delicious and crispy. The fried pickle was good (but for some reason was expecting a dill pickle and not sweet pickles). The burger was good (not the best in London, but really tasty). It did fall apart quite easily, but apparently Bea likes them that way. There was plenty of meat and the bacon was really delicious (apparently it's beef bacon that they make there), and the onions were really great. The chicken and waffle was nice, but seemed a bit sweet for me, so I was glad I got the burger. The shakes were really delicious (although slightly warm and melty by the time we got them). We split the duffin sundae, and it was really tasty but in a very small dish so it was a bit hard to eat. Bea came and talked to us at the end of the meal, so we got to give her a lot of feedback, so hopefully she'll take it into consideration and change things. She already has decided to take certain things off the menu, and she may be adding the fried green tomatoes as one of the sides.The venue itself is a bit small, so I imagine if it gets popular it might be tricky to get in. I'm quite curious about the brunch, so I may be back for that sometime. I hope that it improves, because I really did enjoy myself while I was there.",

    "text": "ok, ok so I had never heard of Kingly Court. I prided myself on knowing every inch of this, my city but alas a great big slightly wonderful retail outlet place with fantastic food selections completely escaped my notice! Anyway, we happened upon this place last Sunday. \u00a0Being spoilt for choice, it was tricky deciding where to go, but I eventually decided I needed a burger-badly. Stax seemed like the place. it is quite small with only a few tables. There was one empty so we nabbed that. I'm not sure I would like to attempt to enter on a Friday or Saturday if it is this busy on Sunday! Anyway, the interior is all faux distressed chairs and tables, with different types of chairs or stools around each knackered, wonky table-I liked it I must say. We ordered cocktails only because we were going to have them but couldn't face the walk back to Brasserie Zedel. Wife and son had Mojitos and said they were fine. I had a John Hamm Old Fashioned which was good. We all had the burgers-boy, it was good! My one slight issue was I asked for it medium but it was actually more on the rare side, with lots of juice running out. However, the meat was clearly such good quality I enjoyed it very much-tender, moist (a tad too much but, hey) and above all tasty. Very recommended. For desert we had a duffin sundae without the cream. I'd never had a duffin before-it was great. By the end I admit the loud music was grating a little but that's just me. Recommended as a good \u00a0option amongst the many in Kingly Court.",

There's been a saturation of naughty American food outlets in recent years, so we hope Stax can stand out from the rest based on their amazing fried chicken and waffle dish (the unlikely combo DO work!).

Sorry - diner; there's a item on the menu that doesn't come in a bun.We had to wait for seating, but not too long. I got a good seat where I could look straight into the kitchen. This brings me to my first bad point. The stools you sit on were shaped from the xenomorph from Aliens bony assed backside. One of the most uncomfortable seats I've ever sat on - my ass was numb and I had pins and needles in my left leg by the time I finished eating.Ok, good point - they do guest sodas (read American sodas you can't get in normal shops here). They had Fanta Grape on the day I visited. This brings me into the food - the burgers are pretty good but man, that chicken. Best breading I've had anywhere. The beef bacon is also interesting... but that is some platinum standard fried chicken. So good that they could have served it in a dirty bucket in a thunderstorm and I'd be all like \"I have to come back here for more chicken\".The three stars is simply because of the ass numbing seats and the service was super slow. Friendly, but slow - but this is partly dictated by the size of the kitchen as that has limited space.But this should get five stars in the future - I just need to order the chicken (rather than eating half the missus' order), take a cushion and go on a Cherry Pepsi day.",

    "text": "Back and forth I've gone on the number of stars for this review, but I think a 3 sums it up.I'd gone to a Yelp event at Stax last year, and while I wasn't wowed, I thought it was definitely worth a repeat visit now that they're all settled in. We waited a few minutes for a table, but not that long, on a Wednesday at around 6.30pm.The tables are tiny, and you sit on pretty uncomfortable low stools, and every time someone walks past you, you'll get bumped.I had planned to get an onion blossom, but it wasn't on the menu any longer. So I had the ranch chickadee, my companion had a big stax, and we shared the small fries and the deep fried pickles. We did have to wait a really long time to order (the people next to us, seated only seconds before, ordered a good 10-15 minutes before us). The food wasn't quick but it wasn't annoyingly slow.My sandwich was delicious. The chicken was great, the bun buttery and soft, and the sweet beef bacon made a great combo. I did pull out the lettuce and tomato, which were just getting in my way, as it's a really messy sandwich. The fries were fine. I did not like the pickles at all - they tasted like they had been soaked in beer, and they didn't have much pickle flavour. Plus they were quite big spears, so there was all this warm pickle-ish juice. I didn't even finish half of one of the 4 in our order. I tried my husband's burger but didn't like it - I found it a bit gamey, and underseasoned. He liked it though, and will probably review it well.We finished up and I knew I wanted a dessert, so we waited. And waited and waited. Our food was clearly done, with our dirty napkins on top of the baskets. By this point I was pretty uncomfortable, with nowhere to put my legs and a sore yet numb backside from the horrid stool. We probably waited 15 minutes for our baskets to be cleared and get a dessert menu. There were at least 2 waiters, and they weren't that busy - so few tables! Finally our order was taken, and after another 10 minutes, we had our duffin sundae. Which was delicious, but really sweet and definitely best for sharing. We asked for our bill when our dessert came and couldn't believe it was \u00a342. We each had 1 coke, no alcohol or shakes. Crazily expensive, for food which was half good and half bad, non-existent service, and uncomfortable seating. I don't think we'll be back.",

    "text": "Pretty great food to be honest. Insultingly huge portions. I already ripped into another review today with too much blunt honesty, so instead, the things that were lacking we shall list, but chalk it up to accidentally misappropriated oversight on our visit. Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich- so she liked the food, but when madam asked for them to just not include the spicy mayo and add some cheese at whatever cost, it seemed to be such a problem as though slapping on some cheese is going to lower the michelin rating of the place. It's just a slice of cheese...that much hoopla almost made me feel like....eh. Fried chicken sandwich- the only downside honestly was that it was too much food! Lol...I mean honestly I have an appetite but to be fair, this was uncalled for. But I didn't mind the leftovers at home. The biggest sour note of the evening...and I truly apologize for this but some of you prefer to have this heads up on the matter (or a business might want to reemphasize this point) but one of the servers had the most odious stench...I'm not saying hands weren't washed, or maybe tonsil stones were out of whack, but honestly. There might have been a sanitation violation if the former, so hopefully it was the latter and if so we've all been guilty at some point. Otherwise, keep on serving good food.",

I didn't have a problem with it, but i realize that some fancy British burger eaters can't maneuver around the crumbly style of burger patty. The po'boy sandwich had a funky sauce that i didn't like but it wasn't mine so. .phew! good thing or else that would've been a 4 instead of a 5 star rating. I happen to go on a tuesday where they give away ice cream at the end of your meal for free. yay! Can't wait to go again!",

    "text": "I didn't come here by choice, my friend only eats halal food so technically I was forced here. Their menu looked OK so thought what the hell let's just go. It's a pretty cramped place, and fairly busy with queues forming to the outside. We were sat near the window, I was merely there to eat so to me it didn't make a difference. I ordered the spicy chickadee burger, stax small fries and a raspberry ice tea. I was in a bit of a shock once it was brought out to me. It was maaaaaoooooosssiiivvveeee, bigger than my actual face (no joke) I was thinking how the hell am I going to fit this in my mouth. It should come with a warning!!!! There were 3 big fillets of chicken, melted cheese, onion gravy, tomato, mayo, chilli pepper sauce and erm lettuce. Don't think I've missed anything out. The chips were a bit meh, I didn't really like them tbh. But this burger, so I took a bite and I like being neat and tidy when I eat, but I went in for the kill with loads of tissues around me if I did drop anything. The first few bites were pleasant, then came the hot pepper sauce, so I can take my hot spicy food, but when you're suffering from a major cold with a cough and a waterfall nose, this sauce will make you snort (not literally so loud) but loud enough that you can feel it going down the wrong way! I managed to eat half of it before I began to sweat. Then I knew I had to stop! Great place for American style burgers, small joint on the first floor of kingly court. Nice drinks menu, although I don't recommend the raspberry ice tea, it's like raspberry juice with ice. Very sour and nothing special. Best to share a burger and well maybe opt for cajun fries than their regular ones. Will return when I'm not so blocked up everywhere! When I feel normal again!",

    "text": "Stax Diner is in a great location - it's based in Kingly Court, right off of Carnaby Street. It's on the 1st floor (2nd floor for Americans). The weather was nice when I went so that windows and doors were open. It has a lovely al fresco feel to it. The food was fantastic. If you're a fan of American-style burgers, this is the place for you. Start with the Stax burger, then add whatever fittings/toppings/condiments you fancy. It's super messy but worth it! \u00a0The sides are great. My friend and I shared slightly spiced cajun fries and the onion blossom. I absolutely loved the onion blossom. It's a large dish therefore great for sharing. \u00a0I didn't get a chance to try the milkshakes so can't comment on it. I'll definitely come back and make sure I save room for it. Highly recommended for people to enjoy burgers and fries. For vegetarians - there is a fried green tomato sandwich that looks amazing.",

    "text": "This was THE hardest restaurant I've ever tried to find. Ever. In any city. I'm not blaming Stax of course, I had the address and a mental map of the area but still could not find it. Then I noticed a little opening squished between two buildings with a sign of \"Kingly Court\" right above the doorway. I must have walked by it two or three times without realising. I think I was expecting a bigger sign pointing it out, so for anyone like me just a note look carefully for the sign. We came here for our 4th of July lunch/snack because Stax was having a 2-for-1 on milkshakes and ice cream floats. I love ice cream floats! Especially root beer ones which I don't think are common in the UK. I ordered the \"Brown Cow\" a.k.a. a root beer float which came in a glass with a can of A&W containing the rest of the soda. I honestly thought this would be bottomless as one can wasn't filling enough for me. Really glad we came during their special as I don't think it's worth it to get two on a normal occasion. Their cajun blooming onion on the other hand will be ordered every time I come here! I was very impressed by the size, the crispiness, the seasoning, and the dipping sauce. It really is meant to be split between two - we came starving and we were almost unable to finish it. The dipping sauce was my favourite, garlic and kind of mildly chipotle. It paired perfectly with the onion. In terms of being located in Kingly Court, despite me taking forever to find it at first I'm very glad it is located here. It was so nice and calm, it felt so secluded from the hustle and bustle of the city despite being right next to Regent Street. The diner itself is small and an odd long rectangle design but during off-peak hours there were no problems of people bumping into us to get pass. I can imagine there may be some problems when it's crowded. Service was also pleasant and helpful, our server even wished me a \"Happy 4th\" which I appreciated. I can't wait to come back and try other Southern favourites, particularly the chicken and waffles. A great place for American food, I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Another American-styled burger joint in London! Not too bad actually, the burger patties are super crumbly making eating a bit messy yet maintaining all the natural juices and flavoring.The \"Big Stax\" and the \"Bring Home the Bacon\" burgers were nice, patties were juicy yet the buns were not soggy. Always a plus.Wasn't a huge fan of the fries they served. In the States, they'd be wedges. Though I'm quite particular with my fries, preferring crunchy and golden as opposed to softer wedges. I think if they cut them smaller, theyd probably be able to achieve that crispier texture. My English friend Bobby says, \u00a0\"The chicken was heavenly soft yet saltily crunchy. The waffle base, a perfect foundation to absorb the counterpunching syrup.\" (Clearly this guy has never had chicken and waffles before.) Chicken and waffles were great, I'm guessing this dish isn't too common in the UK.I think overall this place has potential. Today was the second day they've been open, a soft opening. Most probably come back in a bit when they've settled in a bit!Ps. They ran out to A&W root beer which was disappointing, but hey, it's on the menu and that's spectacular.",

    "text": "I was grateful to have zero wait on a Saturday night in Soho. Of course that generally comes with a price. We were seated by the window to people watch although there was barely enough room for two and a pile of cables under the table. Thankfully my friend is not high maintenance.We had to flag down someone for our order and then food arrived before the drinks. My cocktail was a very strong mint julep so they need to work on the alcohol ratio. Food was average, southern American fare.We both had giant chicken ranch burgers that were fun to admire but not practical to eat. I took out the onion rings to eat separately and tomato slices so I could still barely fit the rest in my mouth. Fried chicken was good. Their special sauce aka \"ranch\" was not even white but tasted ok. Fried pickles were cut in big wedges and basted in too thick of a batter. Same not-so ranch dipping sauce was served with them. We each only ate one. If you need a fried fix, it will do but it's not original or exceptional, especially for two discerning Americans. Plenty of other better burger joints nearby.",

If you're wanting a halal or any burger fix come here. The beef bacon in the burger is a bit interesting (more chewy and sweet) I didn't really care for it so I would say skip it. This is probably the closest you'll get to an American burger fix. I ordered the stax original with cheese, caramelized onions, and pickles, side of Cajun fries, and the New York mocktail. Everything was excellent. They have plenty of other things on the menu like milk shakes, mocktails, chicken burgers, chicken and waffles..etc. if you're looking for place to eat and you're close to stax then come here asap. The service is fast, ambiance is nice, \u00a0it's really busy around 5ish so come early to avoid lines.",

Traveling alone in London and hungry for a burger, it was meant to be. As a native New Yorker, I avoid touristy sites like the plague so I had to laugh at myself when I found myself at the Westminster tube station. Walking towards Stax Diner, I 'discovered' tourist spots that looked all too familiar. Big Ben? Check. Westminster Abbey? I discovered that one, too. The National Gallery? You bet. Walking up to Stax was interesting. Nonetheless, the physical establishment was a nice (replica) of an old-fashioned American diner. I had a burger topped with maple-glazed beef bacon AND an Oreo milkshake to feed my inner glutton, of course. The burger was underwhelming which I'd say was because of the over-crisp bacon and well done(!?) patty.The highlight of my night was watching the behind-the-scenes development of an Instagram(?) post. For about 20 minutes, I watched a very enthusiastic gentleman take pictures of his significant other. After each set of pictures, she would review his job and send him back for more shots of her. Now, that's real millennial love. In all, the ambience was good but the burger could have been much better. I'd give this place 3.6 stars if I could.",

We were happy to be seated immediately, although there wasn't a huge amount of space at and around the table so it was a bit of a squeeze, especially if you have shopping bags. Our server was really nice and service was fairly quick. My friend and I ordered two different burgers and then split them so we could try more things on the menu. We tried 'Bring home the Bacon' and the Big Stax. I was drawn in by the maple glazed bacon! However I found the burgers to be really greasy and messy. You need plenty of napkins as your hands get covered. The fries were fine, nothing outstanding. I felt a bit disappointed about the experience and probably wouldn't return. Especially as there are so many other options in Kingly Court.",

Strangely enough we heard about Stax Diner on the Food Network in the morning while we were figuring out our day, and Stax is Delicious just like Food Network said. We both ordered the Stax Burger, I got mine with a double stack (two patties). We were both very impressed with the burgers. Burgers had a great charcoal flavor and juicy, bun was fluffy and nicely toasted/warm, also bun did not become overly soggy when eat'n from the juicy burger meat, and cheese was melted and oozing out, just straight perfection. Cajun fries were nice and crispy, and not too spicy. Atmosphere and servers very friendly and attentive. My wife says it's not better than Butch Annie's, which is located in Cambridge, U.K. \u00a0I'm torn because they are both very delicious! Good news is I have an AMAZING burger joint to go to if in Cambridge or London, oh because I'll definitely be going back!!",

These places have such great character and have the feeling that they're some undiscovered little diner... So Stax's just of Carnaby Street, which is very similar in feel - how does that live up? Short story - extremely well... with this being on of my favourite burger places in London.Maybe it's because in smaller places more care is taken on your food? Maybe it's a theme, maybe or maybe it makes sense because this restaurant is run by Bea Vo who also ran Bea's of Bloomsbury, and the renowned Maltby Street Dine...Whatever the secret the burgers here are wonderful - really filling, patties made of great quality meat, a fantastic selection of fillings and toppings, all which contribute to a simply delicious burger.A portion of family Cajun fries (which will feed two) is \u00a33.25 and well worth it.Some of the bigger more complicated burgers are more expensive, but the cheeseburger is under \u00a39 and you get a choice of quality cheese, rather than just a yellow American slice.I also great to know their meat is ethically sourced and also brought on demand.In addition to burgers they also do chicken and waffles, however I can't comment on these, having not tried them.I also have to like that they have a Stax challenge: \u00a325 for a claim to fame (and your place on the wall for those who complete), a 5-beef patty stax burger, a basket of Cajun boardwalk fries, and a super-sized milkshake.

I was surprised about how small it is. Fortunately, I did not have to wait and got a place straight away.Going through the menu, I decided to skip desserts and instead had an Oreo milkshake. It was delicious. At times it was pretty thick, making it a bit difficult to drink. Admittedly, I am no expert in milkshakes - so I simply think that's probably how it's supposed to be.As main dish I ordered waffle with southern fried chicken. I really liked the waffle together with the chicken. The fried chicken pieces were nicely spiced and perfectly crispy on the outside. Now, I only had one little problem with this dish: waffles with maple syrup, good, waffles with chicken, great, waffles with maple syrup and chicken - really? For me, maple syrup has no place there.As side, I had cajun fries. They were lovely crunchy skin-on chips with a beautiful mild heat.Overall, I was very happy with my food, only the service was perhaps a tiny bit slow. If you like crispy chicken and find yourself in Soho, you should definitely give Stax Diner a try!",

    "text": "To begin, this review is based on being seated at 20:00 on a Thursday. We initially tried to sit down at two other places - being faced with 1 hour waits - before finding a table here. To warn you, the only reason why we stayed was because my girlfriend was faint and needed to sit down and eat.We sat down at the only available table, which was right next to the door and every time someone came in, the breeze sent a chill from the blistering cold outside. This place is not fast food (as you will find by the 30 minute wait for your food to arrive) and so I think the least you can expect when paying restaurant prices is some comfort. The seating arrangements make for a very cramped experience, while the stools are too small and bad for posture.The toilets were filthy and the decor was tacky and cliche - we didn't hold much hope for the food based on the cleanliness so asked for medium-to-well done on our Stax burger to make sure we wouldn't feel the effects of this place the next day.When our food arrived the burger was still pink in the middle which, say what you will about well done meat being sacrilege, is NOT well done.The cajun fries are bland and not well seasoned, while the \"Chocoholic\" shake had no taste of rum in it. There were some glimpses of interesting flavours, but the burger in general is a mess; a mish-mash of flavours that don't really gel, and characterless sides that leave you wishing you went elsewhere. The waitresses were not in sync and our proximity to the door meant that we were able to hear their conversations. Orders were frequently mistaken, mixed up and waitresses were taking orders for tables that were not theirs whilst not reminding the waitress whose table it was. They were also quite rude and dismissive of people looking for a table, and while they were not customers, their politeness would help this diner in the long run.For \u00a343 inc. gratuity we had a Stax burger, Spicy Chicken burger (I forgot the ridiculous name), Cajun Fries, Onion Rings and a Chocoholic shake. I think that \u00a325 total is how I would value this meal in any other part of the country, but it's proximity to Regent St and Oxford St, and it being in London means that the demand and mark up is quite high.With a little more effort you can quite easily get much, much better value nearby. I would recommend Bodeans on Poland Street; great burgers, generous shakes and fantastic cocktails. You even get to watch sports whilst eating! Hell, if you don't want to travel far Pizza Pilgrims is just downstairs from Stax if you don't have to have a burger. In short, try to avoid this cramped mess. You won't get much in return for your patience apart from that sickly feeling you get when you realise that you have been ripped off (or is that the food?)",

Unfortunately, our first choice of Pitt Cue BBQ had an hour wait and nowhere to stand, so we wandered into Kingly Court - there are a number of options here, including Pizza Pilgrim's, but Stax Diner was serving the quickest, and we were hungry!They told us it would be about a 45 minute wait but not 20 minutes later we found ourselves seated at one of their window bars. The decor is pretty cool, with a huge chalkboard covering one wall to display the menu, but you can't deny that it feels small. Not a problem if you're planning to duck in and out just for food, but it doesn't allow much 'whiling away' time.The menu is simple, and we both went for chicken burgers. My chicken ranch was pretty tasty, the huge serving of chicken getting me very excited when it first appeared on the table - there is no way you can eat here politely, so don't even try! The sauce was a bit too much and the bun completely disintegrated. I'm no stranger to messy eating but I barely got 3 bites in before having to dig in with cutlery.We shared a small portion of fries (you can get small or family, which I can imagine would be very much to share between 3-4 people) and some onion rings. The fries were truly delicious and probably my favourite thing of our selection, and the onion rings were a close second, though the crumbly coating wasn't quite what I was expecting texture wise.Service was good throughout, though our position meant we weren't checked up on. I doubt we would have been very responsive due to the combination of general tiredness and the amazing people watching spot we had out on Kingly Court!A good place to know about for future London trips, though the rest of Kingly Court is further up on my list.",

    "text": "Stax serves good chicken and waffles. The chicken is tender and the waffles are a good level of sweetness but a bit too fluffy for my liking. I go here for a guilty fix of US style junk food..The staff are friendly and the service is quick. It's quite small inside so can get loud with the sound of the kitchen, staff and diners. Also, I find that I end up smelling like food when I leave due to the not so great ventilation system.So, all in all, the food is good but with more and more restaurant in London serving US style comfort food, the standards are pretty high.",
