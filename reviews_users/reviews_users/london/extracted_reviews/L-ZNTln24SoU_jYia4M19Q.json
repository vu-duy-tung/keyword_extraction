    "text": "Ottolenghi makes the best salads in London. They use fresh, seasonal ingredients and the menu is always changing, which is a good sign to me. The vegetable combinations they come up with are creative and usually spot-on. A recent example is roasted jersey royal potatoes, samphire, grilled English asparagus, broad beans, dill, chervil, lemon and pink peppercorns. That may sound like a lot to throw in one salad, but it worked. You could taste each ingredient in the mix, yet no single ingredient overpowered the others. It's the perfect place to go if you're looking for a light lunch, but expect to pay for this perfection. A combination of four salads on a plate costs \u00a311. You can get them to go in a take-away box and pay by weight, but it soon adds up. The Ledbury Road location has a communal table in the back with table service, unlike their Kensington location.",

Ottolenghi also has amazing salads. \u00a0But be prepared to dish out a cool \u00a315 for a box of brocolli. \u00a0You have to decide if all of this is worth it to you (and to me, the chocolate cake is totally worth it).",

First you wait for a table, then for the food and so on. The waitresses end up running around like crazy and forgetting thigs in between.

I'd heard so many good things, and walked past their windows so many times... both in Islington, and at this outlet in Notting Hill, bewitched, enticed, even driven to salivation, by what I saw and the enthusiastic awe with which people spoke of it. \u00a0If there was a darling ode to epicure that I was eager to try, the sophisticated Ottolenghi - with its heaps of mosaic salads on staggered platforms and heavenly baked goods looking like sheer sin against that gleaming white backdrop - was it. \u00a0Everything just looked so *good*... it *had* to *be* good.And so it was that I arrived at the Notting Hill Ottolenghi's doorstep agog; waiting to be whisked off my little foodie feet... based on sheer seductive looks alone they had a head start on the feet-whisking without me even sampling a morsel... but like most things that aren't what they appear to be, Ottolenghi let me down - hard and fast.To start - two caveats about the Notting Hill branch: 1) There is no toilet (but they'll let you wash your hands where the counter staff does, right next to the till. \u00a0I know, I know, you were thinking that this place was supposed to be pretty chichi, or at least chichi enough to have toilets - yes, I did too).2) There is no wine list... even though their salads and savory nibbles are screaming to be paired up with say, a crisp Sauvignon Blanc or even a casual C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne... no, gingerbeer is as hard as it gets.I will leave it up to you to rank those two caveats in order of importance or relevance to your own situation ... after arriving here one late afternoon to meet a friend, rather cold and tired after a stressful week...they were both of great import and relevance to me.*Now* onto Ottolenghi's famous food - \u00a0and this is where it starts to get really disappointing... because, after giving my bladder a pep talk about its need to be patient with me, and ordering some sparkling water in lieu of a Syrah... my consolation was that the food was all going to be worth it.... Ha.I chose to go with the \"small salad\" sampler, which allowed me to choose three of the gorgeous looking salads in the front window for just under \u00a310. \u00a0After plenty of consternation over which salads I should order, when they arrived, I realized I needn't have fretted over the matter so much, because, well, there wasn't enough on my plate to have bothered fretting about. \u00a0Now, I'm really not one to quibble on the matter of portion-size... I'm a relatively small eater and can too-often be satisfied with a mere appetizer.... and I never ever mind paying for a small nibble if the asking price is more than worth it... \u00a0 But what came on my plate, however, was an absolute joke... seriously, the mass of the three salads *together* didn't appear much bigger than the size of my (relatively small) fist. \u00a0I've uploaded the picture of it, go have a look for yourself (keep in mind that the plate was no more than 8-inches in diameter) and gape at the absurdity that I was charged 10 quid for something like 5 pea pods, 3 carrots, and some other token wilted veg miscellany - without even a glass of wine in hand to take the edge off.Most disappointingly, even beyond the overpriciness of the sampler, was the taste. \u00a0Both the green beans and the roasted vegetables were too oily and there was nothing particularly outstanding or creative about the flavour - especially not more so than what I come up with at home. \u00a0The roasted vegetable salad did have a nice addition of fresh cranberries, but it's the holidays, and cranberries are pretty obvious embellishment this time of year, so I don't give them too much credit for the thought. Perhaps the best thing among my three mouthfuls was the aubergine with its saffron yogurt and pomegranates... now, that was a *little* more scintillating for the palette, but just a little.It was all such a shame, especially since the staff was, to be fair, really nice - but when our waitress offered us dessert, we declined... who cared anymore? \u00a0Nothing could make up the let-down of the meal. \u00a0I would never ever come to Ottolenghi to sit down and dine again... but if I lived in the area... and was in a pinch for dinner... I suppose the takeaway here might suffice... however, if I were in that exact same pinch, and could manage to make it to the Whole Foods takeaway counter... Whole Foods would win, hands down.",

It feels creamy, and heavenly full of chocolate as if there was liquid chocolate in it, but no, it's just melting in your mouth. There was no line when I went (around 18:00) and the food they had laid out looked delicious as well, making me almost regret my Mexican dinner. Beef and broccoli Western style? Covered in glistening olive oil with almonds ontop?! I also had a very nice staff serve me, despite the cramped area.

If the the way the cakes and cookies are stacked in the window don't tempt you, then pop your head around the door and check out the display of enticing salads and meats laid out before the customers. There's something so innocent yet delightful about the chaotic manner the dishes are presented, and everything looks so fresh and exotic. It's almost like the mad-hatter's tea party! Their philosophy is originality in mostly Mediterranean-style cuisine with the best raw ingredients, so whether it's grilled mackerel with olive and raisin salsa, orange and pistachio marshmallows or upside down pear cake, there is something to delight everyone's taste buds. There is a daily changing menu here, and if you're close perhaps it's best to email or call Hilary for a copy at 11am.",

    "text": "My mom and I have been huge fans of Ottolenghi's cookbooks and frequently cook his recipes.. leading us to buy strange ingredients like pomegranate molasses.. Once we knew we were coming to London we knew we had to stop at his restaurant. The spread of dishes and desserts looks amazing when you walk in and it is very hard to make a decision. We decided to do 2 of the salad plates and each had 3 salads. We then shared the 2 plates so that we could each get a taste of almost every salad on offer. The most memorable being the white bean hummus, the roasted peppers with some sort of tahini sauce, and the roasted eggplant with almond yogurt. The broccolini and the butternut squash were also both good but not as memorable as the other three. The food was very delicious and fresh and we even went to a second Ottolenghi location 2 days later. The seating situation is a bit of a pain and it is hard to get seated if there are lots of people around, we were lucky enough to get seated straightaway since it wasn't very busy. Sort of expensive for just vegetables but most definitely worth it. I would eat lunch from Ottolenghi everyday if I could.",

Ottolenghi is always my first choice of cafe when I feel a bit posh and fancy a real treat! The vibrant display of scrumptious delights on offer is superb and they serve healthy dishes in addition to beautiful (and calorific!) cakes and brownies of every kind. The portions are just right and if you go in for a look, you won't be able to resist.I say that I go here when I can indulge in a treat; it isn't quite your everyday coffee and croissant stop in terms of price and does attract the whole yummy mummy type of clientele which is why you can struggle to find a seat even on a weekday afternoon. Plus there is no toilet or bathroom. It is definitely worth a visit though and the service and quality of food is fantastic. After all, you can always buy your food to take away if you can't find a seat or need the toilet! A great place if you are looking for a nice coffee meeting venue.",

    "text": "Thank you Yelp -- for I have found London's best cookie. It was a necessary indulgence, I promise. And not only that, but I enjoyed it physically and verbally for about 15 minutes. Best. Chocorgasm. Evahh. It's dangerous ordering a chocolate chip cookie (seriously kids, watch out) as it's something so simple that is so easily messed up - much like its partner in crime, Miss vanilla ice cream. Something you've been served your entire life, and possibly perfected yourself, is a recipe for pure disappointment. But not today. This cookie had all the right stuff: great chip to cookie ratio, fantastic crisp outside-gooey (but not too gooey) middle, the perfect Goldilock'ed \"just right\" ratio where you're not full after eating it, but you don't need anymore to be utterly blissful. As quickly as I bypassed Ottolenghi's savory options, I duly opted not to sit in the intimate venue, as there was only one thing I wanted to get intimate with at that point. I took my cookie and my \"opening act:\" the fruit slice, (which I might add was delicious in its own right) outside into the beautiful sunshine. My friend was already fully involved in her passion fruit meringue tart, emphasis on the passion. It was the cookie I was after, and it was to be mine. I then proceeded to stuff my face. I would highly recommend doing exactly this. Immediately.",

There's really no way around this. The food is way too expensive (I'd say almost 25% too pricey). \u00a0But then again, look around at what other shops and cafes occupy this area.-No toilet. \u00a0I find this incredibly annoying.I'll be back, probably sooner than I care to admit, but I sort of hate myself for liking Ottolenghi as much as I do, despite all of its flaws.",

We were there during off-peak hours (about 4:30pm) but there was still a good number of people in there who were mostly getting items to go. Seems it was off-peak hours, there wasn't really a systematic line going on but the employees were pretty good in making sure they served who came in first.The pistachio financier was extremely good. I liked that the cake had a very slight \"grainy\" texture which was probably from the pistachios. The mini almond bundt cake had the right amount of moist and wasn't dense nor heavy. Another favorite was the pear galette which was baked in a whole rectangle pastry crust. It's priced by weight according to the size of the slice.I need to return to this place.",

The salads couldn't be any better and the rubhurb and ginger cheesecake was divine. Not too sweet. Just perfect. You do feel conscious that there are about ten people after you waiting to nab your table, so you don't feel like you can linger too long with you tea. If only they would let you put your name down whilst you wait, so you can then go look at the beautiful local posh shops. Well maybe it's better for your wallet that they don't. Ottolenghi you are so thoughtful sometimes.",

    "text": "Went here about 2pm after a long saturday morning of biking on the old Boris bikes so had worked up quite an appetite. We really wanted to sit down but were told that the queue time was 45 mins and we needed food quick.So we grabbed 2x of the large take out boxes. We had an amazing selection of salads beautifully presented in front of us and we were like kids in a candy shop. The highlight was the tuna and the beef that is kinda hidden in the lower area behind all the salad and till area. You cant see it when all bustling customers trying to fill there boxes. We only knew it was there as we caught a glimpse of someone eating it in the tiny outside eating area.After going a bit crazy and filling our boxes we were hit with the bill... \u00a348! yes we had gone overboard. I was quite shocked as nothing was weighed separately and they just seem to cram it in and weigh the whole box? I dunno but I was thinking if the box was full of broccoli then it would be a bit of a bum deal.Needless to say everything tasted amazing and there was enough for my girlfriend and I to have a delicious lunch on the go and dinner when we got back home! (I wanted to try and make it last all week).I wanted to try the amazing looking cakes but i think i'll save that for next time I visit!",

I opted for take out instead. There was a queue when I went. I decided to get a small takeout box of salad. First time here no idea what to get, I suggested the waitor to put in a bit of everything. When I got home and had my salad to my dissapointment I was only able to try the green beans, peppers and some Quinoa. I had seen at least 6 other salads (mainly the potatoes ) that I was hoping to try. I also asked what he recommended for those meat and he suggested the roast beef. It was good, it came with a wasabi type sauce that was awesome. The other thing I purchased was a cheesecake. It tasted great and very filling howver I wonder about the sanitary about these products since they are left all out in the open with the queue building up right beside it.",

After a bit of indecision, I took a vanilla and blueberry cupcake and it was delicious. I am not a huge fan of cupcakes, but this one had the right amount of sweetness and softness. I sat at the table and around me there were other 5 ladies (all woman in there in the afternoon, was it a coincidence?) having salty foods as well as desserts. I saw some interesting salads at the entrance and there was a menu for salads and mains on display as well, I think 3 salads were \u00a311 and a main + 2 salads \u00a313.5 or so.The atmosphere is very relaxing as everything is white and there are also magazines and few books to read. Prices are okay, \u00a34.40 for a cupcake plus service and the waiters are nice. I'll come back soon.",

Sure, the other customers there are a little snobbish, but who cares anyway, since the most important thing is the divine food.

    "text": "Mmmhmm chocolate. Sometimes you just need a fix. A cookie (double chocolate please), a brownie, or maybe a bit of cake (be it stuffed with Bailey cream or shaped in volcano form). Or in my case when you can't make up your mind why not go for all of them. Excellent life decision.So needless to say, I can't really comment on any other foodstuffs but I can describe the majority of chocolate offerings in intricate detail. Go on, you say? Why certainly!First, the cookie. There are usually two types, your regular chocolate chip and the double chocolate. The regular is just want you want for that warm bit of comfort with a glass of milk before bed. Must remember to get some next time and actually save them. The double chocolate was rich and moist with just a hint of crunchiness at the outer skin. It's more dark chocolate than milk so be warned it's slightly bittersweet but that just makes it easier to eat more.Second, the brownie. Now they really take the term \"fudge brownie\" seriously as this massive square of chocoholic mana tastes like the love child of my favourite St. Louis fudge and the K&C classic brownie. It's incredibly rich but with a surprisingly light taste of hazelnuts (undoubtedly infused from the roughly chopped hazelnuts that are scattered through this delight) which dances around your mouth before settling on your tongue. One bite and I was in love. Well as much as one can love baked goods. Which is quite a lot as it turns out.The two cakes I had the pleasure of tasting were both good but unfortunately nothing special. The \"volcano\" was a chocolate and almond tea cake drizzled with chocolate icing. A moist cake but compared to the chocolate madness I had enjoyed so far was a bit lacking in...chocolateness. The Baileys cream cake was incredibly melt in your mouth moist and would have been a perfect cake except for the overpowering alcohol taste of the cream. It was stronger than a shot of Baileys which was a bit surprising.Other offerings we tried was a light spongy cake that was well received by the girls although not by me as it was fruit and not chocolate (yes I know I have a one track mind) and a chocolate flourless cake that was essentially a mousse in cake shape.The wait was a bit long even at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon (about 15 minutes) and the place was packed inside so we took it home to snack on. The lovely waitresses were very friendly and traded jibes about my inability to choose just one dessert. Overall, next time I'm in Notting Hill I'll stop off for a sweet treat (maybe another brownie or I hear they have an excellent cinnamon brioche). It's worth a trip if you have a sweet tooth or two and one of the top confectionaries in London.",

I saw a fly buzzing around and landing on various morsels that previously I had been contemplating putting inside my mouth. There are few forces in this world that can calm my tempestuous appetite, but the thought of an indirect kiss with an insect is one of them. They don't keep the desserts under any sort of protection (in a glass counter, under glass domes, under net domes, in saran wrap...) so I realized that whether I was there to witness the indiscretion or not, some steamy exoskeleton-on-pastry action is probably bound to be happening at some point during the day. If only I hadn't seen it, I'm sure it wouldn't have affected the taste. Sometimes ignorance really is bliss!",

The Islington location has a larger, brighter and more spacious communal seating areas than Knotting Hill.Every food items here is truly unique and true to an idea. The selections vary, there are choices of manny different types of salads and add on mains. But do not be fooled, a salad is not always what you think. The aubergine salad is a meal in itself. And the flavors are rich and varied. You can easily taste many choices with combination of three salads as part of your main.Service is what you would expect in a communal eating experience, fine but not fast. You can always take away food (we prefer after we eat there first).And do not forget to stop buy and grab various cookies and other amazing items (I am looking at you spiced nuts!) on the way out.Recap: go there, go there now. It is what the essence of good, fresh food is all about, without any of the pretension and bs.",

This particular location only had a large table down some stairs, so most people take food to go. That's what we did. I think their salads are a bit different from other places, because they offer wider flavors and more imaginative options. They cooked their cauliflower with some kind of magic- the best cauliflower I've ever eaten at a restaurant- and that's really saying something! The eggplant (oh sorry, aubergine ;) ) dish was very good as well, and the pomegranate and yogurt sauce complimented it wonderfully. I also liked the sweet potato, and the green beans had a curry spice that was nice too. The desserts were beautiful but I didn't try any. The only thing is- high quality delicious stuff comes with a price. Additionally, the plates of food are sitting out towards the customers, leaving it quite easy for people to breathe, cough, or shed their hair on them.",

Run by the Israeli born chef, Yottam Ottolenghi, you will be amazed once you step inside his Mediterranean inspired cafe.Upon entering, you will gawk at the meringues piled high, cakes of all shapes and sizes, cheesecakes, brownies, cookies, tarts, scones, muffins, mini loaves, croissants, pastries, and many more delectable treats.On a more savoury note, they have about ten different fresh and healthy salads and vegetable sides, all served on large platters and white bowls, like a buffet. Reminded me of Christmas! There is also a separate menu too.We picked up a few salads and a delectable treat (peanut and chocolate s'mores, yes please!) and enjoyed these at a nearby park. The reason we got takeaway is because seating is limited, with only a communal table out the back.\u00a0Ottolenghi has a few different cafe locations, but Notting Hill is my favourite. Mainly because of the food displays and looking through the large window from the street... piled high with cakes, tarts, meringues, cookies, chocolate... it is a sweet lover's dream.",

The space is bright and friendly, with a warm and welcoming staff. There is a communal table in the back with the day's newspapers as well as some delightful homemade jams and spreads to go with your breakfast. There are also plenty of pastries and items to take home at the front of the shop, which are all gorgeous!",

However, the people there were so unfriendly and rude. The food is good, but expensive. What made me very disappointed at this place was the humiliation I experienced as I was leaving the restaurant. One of the men working there ran after me and asked me if had paid the bill. All eyes were on me. \u00a0Someone else took my order and I paid her. I told him yes, and asked if he wanted to see my receipt. He said no and apologized, but it was too late. The damage was done.",

It was nice to enjoy them in the room downstairs with good coffee and tea. The staff was very attentive and helpful.",

I had the mixed berry and fig financier. \u00a0This was absolutely delicious and exceeded my expectations...crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside Really well portioned as I couldn't entirely finish this.",

You can order food for takeway or sit down, which is what I did. There's a small white table down the stairs with community seating, I ordered the main dish with two side salads. I got the chicken, which had some delicious cumin and soy blend, as well as roasted cauliflower saffron salad and the aubergine with pomegranate and yogurt (so amazing). I will now have to contemplate how to make this everyday at home.The pastries you cannot pass up either, the lemon cake with pistachios was so good I didn't take a picture.Be prepared to spend some money on salads here! Save your drinking money for salads :) or atleast some. It's worth it.",

I came for lunch and was not at all disappointed. This place was AMAZING. I wish there was a place like this in the states (maybe Fadi's?). The menu changes daily, so all I can say is anything you get will be amazing. They use the freshest ingredients. All the dishes are different -- spiced differently, different vegetables, etc. For an American, I wasn't filled with the portions, but I also got the smaller plate, so for the future, I would opt for the larger. I even took home a few different seasonings to gift to my Mom as a souvenir. The place was packed, and rightfully so. I took a meringue dessert to go, similar to a pavlova (it had a raspberry sauce on top), which was also good. I want to make London, especially Notting Hill, and annual place I visit -- mainly for the good food and shopping, as is readily available at Ottolenghi.",

Upon entering the small space, we were met by a long table holding countless salads and pastries on different levelled tiers.The menu at Ottolenghi is simple and minimal, with the focus on salads and pastries on display, and a few hot items. Ottolenghi pays special attention of vegetables, especially his amazing salads. There was an option of a large or small salad plate that allowed you to pick out three (for the small plate) or four (for the large plate) types of salads.Seating is extremely limited, so bear that in mind when visiting. There is a communal table that seats up to ten people down the back, however most people opt to take away. Make sure you try out their roasted aubergine salad, and don't forget about the sweet pastries on offer.",
