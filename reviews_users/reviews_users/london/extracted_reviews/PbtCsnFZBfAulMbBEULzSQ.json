(The Spanish one actually - goat cheese and red peppers.) And already I'm developing a craving for another one!Absolutely terrific. Sweet potato fries came out piping hot too. Friendly, prompt service. Also very cute decor!Go here!!",

Nom, nom, nom.And the onion rings here? \u00a0YES PLEASE. \u00a0Big old honkers that are two rings thick and real wide. \u00a0With a light airy breading, and perfectly fried. Not quite enough salt in the breading, but with a good sauce to dip in not really noticeable. BTW, if you are a party bigger than four you'll definitely want to call in a res. \u00a0In fact if you're planning going during rush hours you should do so anyways otherwise you might be standing awhile.Hach\u00e9 makes me happy!.",

I love the staple burgers, the canadian, blue cheese, etc.. but for the more adventurous there's one with peanut butter (for real real), and a selection of veggie and fish for your friends that won't eat meat but you can't be bothered to give up your craving for a massive burger. BEST onion rings I've found in ages. That's a hands-down, it's the golden battered kind, not that odd crumbly dusted kind that comes in freezer bags. With charming lights and decor, this is a cute little stop for a comfort food indulgence which will keep you coming back for more until you've tried all of their burger range and then back a few more times to make sure you've picked the proper favorite.",

They have honey mustard as a condiment. Not Dijon, but reaaaaal honey mustard. When I asked, I'd clearly forgotten where I was and what country I was in but when she showed up with my crispy frites and a small bowl of beautiful yellow sauce....I tell you, it was like a light was shining down. I heard a choir. It was one of the best dining moments ever. I'd go here and order fries and honey mustard anytime.AND...they had onion rings. Real, crispy, unhealthy onion rings that you can get in state fairs in Michigan (word, Thomas). Have never seen them around London town before. I wonder if I could order take out and just get onion rings and honey mustard....",

My burger was pretty good (Classique Anglais with cheddar added, I believe) and was also fairly huge and my friend's meals were also well received - between us we tried the duck burger (phenomenal reviews), the chicken moutarde sandwich (very good as well), and another burger (can't remember which). We also split some chips, wedges, onion rings, and another potato of sorts amongst the table. All were very good but it was far too much food. The only downside of the meal was the unexpected size of the bill - \u00a373! My shock may be partly due to my foreign concept of how much things should cost (I'm from NYC) but it's not entirely.",

I thought the staff were all great and I really enjoyed the atmosphere and decor of the place. Although, I half wonder how comfortable it would be eating here with a full restaurant considering how close the tables are to each other rather than the sparsely populated lunchtime experience that I had.I felt that the policy of just serving hamburger on its own is a little mean. No sides, no chips. At least somewhere like Honest Burger - yelp.co.uk/biz/honest-bu\u2026 provides all you need right they are on the plate for no additional cost. To be honest I would not put this place anywhere near the same league as Honest. I ordered two side dishes which were the fries and the onion rings. I really like the little frying baskets that they both come in, however I felt that they did not taste particularly good and the onion rings were overly oily... saturated, in fact.I particularly hate restaurants that adds service to the bottom of the bill. So much so, that the BBC even quoted an infamous Yelp Talk Thread I started. I don't like having my own mind made up for me as to how much I should tip, however I hasten to add I do not have any complaints in the service department for Hach\u00e9. Not only do they have many different variations of the regular moo burger and they also have lamb, vegetarian and also fish too. I think that a lot of creativity has gone into the menu, however I do feel that a lot of the flavours seem to be better on paper than they actually are on the palate.I would probably give this place another shot but with Honest being equidistant from my place it's going to be a hard fight to get me back there.",

Yea, it's a weird combo but I have fond memories of a burger in New Orleans with PB dedicated to Elvis that tasted amazing so I figured I'd give it go here. I ordered my burger cooked medium and opted for a brioche bun over the ciabatta option and added some jalape\u00f1o for some spice. Also ordered some Hache Frites.My burger arrived looking sinful and tasted wickedly good. The burger was cooked perfectly and the meat was juicy. The bun was soft which helped to soak up the juices. The meat was not as tasty as the Goodman burger in Mayfair, but the crazy toppings created an interesting flavor combo: beefy, salty, sweet, spicy. The peanut butter made it really filling, in fact it's 9 hours later and I'm still really full. The fries were ok.I'm glad I made it over to Hach\u00e9. I dig this place. Burgers are good with interesting flavor combinations, service is friendly and they play good music. Yup, I'll be back. Only, perhaps next time I'll try to swing by ~3pm when it's not so busy.",

    "text": "I'm not really that impressed by this burger place. We came in on a weekday around 6pm and the waiter cramped us onto a tiny table crowded by two other tiny tables and their occupants. We asked if we could get a less cramped table ... as many were empty ... and were told that the rest of the place was reserved ... Really? All of them? In the end they offered a table at the front. Not sure what the problem was, but they made it look like the tables at the front are the worst in the house. They are not.Anyway we ordered our burgers ... they come with no sides dishes whatsoever ... this seems to be the new trend. I really don't like the look of one lonely burger on a plate. Give me some chips at least. The burger in itself was a great size and yummy. The side dish we ordered extra was also yummy. The bill at the end with the massive tip added wasn't that yummy. I really like to make my own decision when tipping, especially as the service wasn't that great. Not awful, mind you, but not worth 12% either.",

However, MeatLiquor turned that on its head and Byron doesn't do so bad for a chain restaurant. I've enjoyed meals at Hache and the ambiance is cute. But the food is just...alright. Beers are tiny and overpriced and it feels as if they're trying to make their burgers fancy without really putting the quality into it. Still, if you're craving a burger, it's not a bad place to stop. I will give them two thumbs up for their veggie options, too. All of the veggie burgers I've had there have been delicious and interesting.",

Imagine-taste it... then you think....Hm.... maybe this could work?Burger + sharp cheddar + peanut butter = Louisiana BurgerSound like something Britney Spears might eat? Yea, probably. Ok, ok, but was it any good?It was good. Mostly novelty, probably wouldn't order it again (it is quite heavy), but *shrugs* not bad, and not nearly as weird as it sounds. One of the other reasons I like Hach\u00e9 (yes, I actually know how to make that little dash) is because of the variety of dips. You may not know this about me, but I am a dip fiend. Chilli/sour cream is a good combo, as is honey mustard. Mmmm, dips. Chips/onion rings = necessary DIP TRANSPORT AGENTS.",

    "text": "What the hell am I doing eating hamburgers in London? I'm American after all, surely I couldn't possibly expect to get a decent burger across the Atlantic any more than a Brit could expect a decent cup of tea in the USA. Or so I'm reminded. But my fellow friends and countrymen, imagine my shock when I took my fellow Yelpers advice and learned that, yes, Virginia (or Massachusetts, California, Texas, etc.) there is a decent burger in London. In fact, this place could exist in Anytown, USA and do pretty well. So what blew my mind? Something called the Louisiana burger. Chunky peanut butter and cheddar cheese on a thick quarter pound burger on a brioche bun. I added bacon, because everything is better with bacon. If the owner/chef/whoever is reading this...believe me, this is amazing with bacon. Holy $#*@, it was so good...I think I may have squealed a little when I bit into it. I certainly inhaled that burger like a little piggy.As no burger is complete without some sort of traditional side, I also had thick cut fries and onion rings which were fried in light, cloud-like batter. Those were also a clear win, as good as any rings I've had in the US. Ryan got a duck burger he liked it, but lamented, rightfully that it is not truly a burger as burger should be ground...for a place that's called Hach\u00e9, they really ought to reflect seriously on that point. Despite not getting ground duck, he seemed pretty pleased with it. So, the downside is seemingly as is the case with every burger I've had in the UK...the burger trended on the dry side. I don't know what that's about, but fortunately for Hach\u00e9 I'm giving them a pass and calling it a cultural thing.",

I must say, I walked past it many times, on my way to her home, intrigued since I like gourmet burgers, but not necessarily chain restaurants.My experience was good, smiley and prompt service. I ordered the Mexican burger. As with more Gourmet burgers, I ate it in pieces, usually as two pieces of accompanying bread and the burger meat independently, rather than all together. We also ordered the yummy onion rings, which were VERY good.The Mexican burger was so so, but I guess that's what happens when you order unconventional fusion things off the menu that haven't been perfected by survival of the fittest Mexican burger competitive force due to lack of Mexican burger rivals.I think i'll go more classic next timeThe ambience was generally cosy and cute with the random fairy lights and low lighting as well as the random cute Halloween fixtures, including an electronic Vampire movie theme tune decoration that the staff found quite amusing to activate EVERYTIME they walked down the stairs towards the toilet. Amusing at first, but not when you're having a conversation.Whilst the food and environment was nice for enjoying a burger in a cosy, intimate environment, it was a bit pricey for what it was. I will return, one day, but not sure if I'd make a special trip just to go....",

I think good meat needs a more substantial bread like that to keep it together. So no qualms from me on that subject. Moving on!Ordered the big \"skin-on\" chips. Tasty and served in a cute little fry basket! Should have read the yelps before I came and ordered onion rings. :( Next time I guess.Loved the atmosphere/decor. Super cute, low-lit, romantic. Ikea flower fairy lights all about. I also liked that there was a nice mix of casual and dressy people. Some fancy dresses, some hoodies, some trendy people. Hey, Camden, what can I say. The one thing that immediately sprung to mind from this experience. It's about the same price as gourmet burger kitchen with much nicer atmosphere. Go here instead!",

    "text": "I consider myself something of a burger connoisseur, and although Hach\u00e9 seemed a little gimmicky, the restaurant when I visited was nearly empty (the market nearby was packed), and some of the reviews here were less than glowing. . .how could I resist a burger with cheddar and crunchy peanut butter? So weird it must be good, right?Unfortunately, although peanut butter and cheddar together will undoubtedly clog your arteries with the best of them, it just isn't a very flavorful combination; the dish really needs a sauce of some sort to make it interesting. If nothing else, \"Louisiana burger\" connotes cajun, creole, tastebud-popping zing, which makes my bland burger doubly puzzling. The beef patty itself was cooked perfectly rare (per my request), albeit rather small. The brioche bun ought to have been toasted more, and the wedges were adequate but could have used seasoning. There were no draught options, moreover, and the bottled beer selection was limited and disappointing. They have a better selection of red wine by the glass than you might expect, however, and my merlot did the trick. The service was efficient and friendly enough that I left a small tip despite the underwhelming food. \u00a320 for a burger, wedges and a glass of wine isn't the end of the world as long as the food and overall experience holds its own. By this logic it's difficult to recommend Hach\u00e9 outright, though I'd give it a second chance if someone else was paying. A solid, on-the-fence 2.5.",

Just one look at the menu and I knew that hunger pains would soon be a distant memory.I had trouble trying to decide between the Catalan burger (chorizo. chilli and tomato jam), Canadian (sweet cure bacon and cheddar cheese) or the Sicilian (parma ham and mozarella cheese). I opted for the Catalan burger with chunky chips. The burger was a little pricy at almost \u00a39 and the chips had to be ordered separately. I didn't mind paying though because the burger was fantastic and the service was brilliant. If you're calorie counting and steering away from carbs- you can have your burger with a green salad instead of the ciabatta bun. I will definately be returning to Hache- it's a shame there isn't one in Westbourne Parke!",

Aside from the food, the vibe is far superior to the typical stuffy, unkept atmosphere that is all places British. Music was great, the service was excellent, and the decor was well done. I particularly enjoyed the pink glitter paint on the ladies bathroom door! If I had to offer any constructive criticism to the restaurant I would say add more cheese options and either get rid of the chair cushions or attach them to the seats!

    "text": "We discovered this place by random when we saw their fancy billboard at the Camden Underground Station. It's located in a quiet alley (side arm of the market) next to a comic shop. As a vegetarian I ordered their falafel burger. Personally, I feel like there should always be the option to go with an actual veggie patty, but this wasn't too far off. They also had a Portobello Burger on the menu (if I recall correctly), but I don't care to have those between a pair of burger buns. The burger tasted pretty good, all ingredients were fresh and looked like a model burger (really tall- watch out for jaw lock). Had fries on the side which were served in a metal grill- looks good but rather unpractical as you'll end up getting salt all over the table.All in all, a nice place with good food and great atmosphere, though I'd recommend it more to meat-eaters. ;)",

    "text": "After spending sometime walking up and down Camden High street I seen a poster board for this place.Tucked up a side street the place was easy enough to find. I entered the restaurant at approx 7pm. If was very busy but I got seated. The menu is pretty straight forward offering gourmet burgers. I settled for a beef burger & sweet potato fries. The food arrived within a reasonable time for me, despite the restaurant being really busy. The flavours and combinations I. The burger were really tasty. The service was good, but being sat opposite the door - meant I had people standing staring at me while I ate. Next time I'll make a point of asking for a table out the back of the restaurant, there appeared to be a better atmosphere. Try this place out, you won't be disappointed",

I always go for the classic burger but you can choose the bread (brioche or ciabatta), the way you want your beef to be cooked, etc. The fries are good too, so is the salad. These burgers are amazing, especially after a long and tiring walk in Camden lock :p",

I had the cheeseburger with French fries and my fianc\u00e9 had the pulled pork one. Quite disappointing... The beef and cheese were ok but the brioche bun was way too dry, plus the special sauce they put in every burger is really bland. Icing on the cake the French fries are not better than the macdonald's ones.",
