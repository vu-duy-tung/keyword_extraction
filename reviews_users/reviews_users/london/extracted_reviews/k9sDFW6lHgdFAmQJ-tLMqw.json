The Japanese salad was not good, it was bland and the rice wasn't sticky.Average. Definitely not awful or even bad, but I wouldn't try this again. The toasted brioche bread was lovely and I was full even after just one small roll because they were stuffed deeply with yummy filling but I didn't particularly like lobster and wouldn't pay \u00a310 for a roll again. I'd rather have a hot dog.",

Everyone will find some concoction of a lobster roll to fancy their taste buds. I ordered the original, my dude ordered the BLLT. I returned to the register to try one their \"ice creams\". There were two options with alcohol inside and one non-alcoholic (strawberry and mint). The strawberry and mint one was delightful, once I could actually eat it. Basically it was one large ice cube in proper packaging to eat out of it. It was a British made product which made me happy. I've tried the lobster roll at Burger and Lobster; I would prefer this place over the chain. Much cheaper and just as good of a product!",

Smack is just a small place, with just a but of space to sit in, but a lot of their aim is clearly takeaway. What do they have? Lobster rolls and lobster salad. \u00a0They have a few varieties of both the salad and sandwich and I decided to start with the Classic lobster tool as well as a very nice bottle of cloudy lemonade. The sandwich arrived quickly. The roll was warm, perfectly buttery, and a bit toasted. The lobster was chilled, with a good amount of sauce drizzle and nice large pieces. I'll admit those from New England in the States would be underwhelmed but I was impressed. At \u00a310 for the sandwich it wasn't the cheapest option I had, but lobster is always on the spendy side. It's a nice little indulgence though and feels like a good treat lunch while in Soho or a good snack on a night out.",

We tried to classic lobster roll - delicious. Whats there not to like - warm buttery brioche, cold lobster. Its amazing! But does not compare to Burger & Lobster...

After passing the infamous Burger and Lobster, which had a queue going all the way up the road, I happily chose to try Smack instead. At half the price (10\u00a3 instead of 20\u00a3) and with no queue, I was impressed with the classic lobster roll I ordered. The roll itself was soft, buttery, and toasted to perfection. They were also pretty generous with the amount of lobster they gave me, which was so delicious!The restaurant is small, but nicely decorated with minimal seating and large windows overlooking dean street. Their staff were friendly and very quick. You can choose a selection of variations on their lobster rolls to eat in or take away. If you get take away, I recommend walking over to St. James park for a picnic!",

The lobster was fresh and the mayo had a nice zing to it, but the best part of it all was the bun!

It came out pretty quickly and it was delicious! I got the original lobster roll and it came out with a good amount of lobster inside. The lobster was cooked pretty well and the roll was really good, too! My friend got a lobster roll, too and she loved it just as much. My other friend got the lobster chowder and she said it was really good, so this place was all around awesome!This place isn't as high quality as Burger & Lobster, but it's definitely still really good and I would go here a lot more often since it's much more casual and cheaper.",

We went with the traditional lobster roll and it was perfect for our appetite. The establishment is very quaint - you could probably fit 12-16 guests in there.

Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?The brisket rolls at Smack Lobster Roll run eight pounds and the lobster rolls twelve pounds, both of which are pretty solid deals given the size of these rolls and the premium that lobster can command these days. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?I opted for the 'Classic' Brisket Roll, which was good although not what I would define as out of this world. The quantity of pickles and onions was a bit overpowering, and while I absolutely loved the crispy sliced roll, the flavor of the brisket fell a tad bit short although I could probably chalk that up to having been spoiled by Texas brisket the past four years. Single Star Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?I simply can't say that I would given the close proximity to Burger and Lobster. It's a good alternative, but not as good as the incumbnet. No Star Granted.",

    "text": "Came here with a friend last night because we didn't feel like lining up for or paying Burger & Lobster prices. Seating is pretty much all communal/bar-stool type, with most patrons being in and out fairly quickly. The lobster rolls themselves take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes to come out after being ordered. Coming from Boston, a \"plain jane\" lobster roll wasn't cutting it for me for 14 quid, so I ordered the Seven Samurai Roll.Somewhere along the way, either someone else took my order or they forgot about it, because 3 groups got their food before I went to hunt mine down. Initially they asked to see my receipt, which was a little infuriating as I was already hungry, and my wallet was chocked full of receipts organized in no particular order. However, after struggling for a bit they told me it was alright. Tip for restaurant owners: never ask a hungry patron to find his receipt after you forgot his food - that would cost you a star in my books. The roll came out shortly after, with a lobster chowder as an apology - I greatly appreciated this, and so Smack Lobster doesn't lose a star.In terms of taste, it was \"alright\". The lobster was fairly generous, but for the price I'm paying I would hope so. There was a little too much seasoning on top, which made both my friend and I cough a bit when trying to take our first bite. Maybe consider putting the seasoning inside rather than as a garnish?Verdict: Relatively good lobster, not as good value for money compared to east coast USA.Yay: Better than what I expected, didn't have to wait long for a table on a Saturday night at 7pmNay: Lost my foodMeh: The price isn't anything to complain about, nor is it anything amazing",

The menu consists of lobster rolls, beef brisket rolls, lobster salads, sweet potato fries, and lobster chowder. You order at the counter, and they bring the food out to you. First things first, the lobster rolls are STUFFED with lobster. I couldn't believe it considering most places I've tried usually skimp on the lobster. I tried two of the three different rolls. The Original - The flavor of this one was incredible! I liked this roll because you could still taste the natural sweetness of the lobster while the light seasoning/sauce brought out the flavor more. My only wish was that there was a bit more butter on the roll. The California - This roll contains lettuce and avocado along with the lobster. The avocado was creamy and a nice addition. However, I prefer the original roll because I think the lobster flavor was overpowered a bit at times in this roll. Lobster Chowder - This was delicious!!! Usually when I order chowder, it's filled with potatoes and rarely any meat. This was completely the opposite - sooo much lobster. Very creamy and flavorful. Sweet Potato Fries - These tasted good, but nothing special. Good side dish to the lobster! Overall, I wish I could eat this place all the time!! For the price, it's quite a deal for the lobster rolls especially with the amount of lobster meat they put. Put this on your London bucket list of places to try(:",

    "text": "With the increasing influence of the Occupy movement, is lobster a symbol of bourgeois decadence and over consumption?

A pocket of crispy bread, generous chunks of lobster in a classic mayoI'll be back to try the other varieties",
