I've been there several times and watched people who come in after me get their food before me and leave, prompting me to ask where my food is and met with 'what did you order?'. I know i'm not alone in this either as i've seen several people get very angry because of the same situation. If they want to keep doing a storming business they need to sort out their system quickly.",

But for me, that's not necessarily a bad thing. The BBQ mackerel and BBQ pork sandwiches are my favourites. They are hearty meals that will leave you full for hours. Not bad for a fiver. I would have given 4 stars, but a few of the sandwiches are full of fat - in particular the duck and pork belly are 70% fat and 30% meat. I know they tend to be fattier meats, but their ratio is just a joke. If like me you're not a fan of the fatty taste and texture stick with the BBQ sandwich varieties.",

Good amount of chilli heat in the Banh Mi, but the balance of flavours in the slightly undersized sandwich felt a little off - a little too hammy and not quite herbal enough with unexpected vegetables seemed mainly to be there to add bulk. That said, the bite of my friend's Kimchi Banh Mi that I had tasted amazing (even if not significantly hotter, despite what the little chilli icons on the menu promised). I like anything with Kimchi, though, so I am not a reliable source.The iced green tea is a nice addition, and very good - but, considering the price and the relative cost of doubling the serving, they could have doubled the serving.So: it's OK and the decor is pleasant but I wouldn't make another detour to get to it.",

The duck meat though was moist, not dry, and flavorful enough for my sandwich. The baguette was nicely toasted and the experience itself was affordable and a nice casual option from a lot of the other restaurants in the area. True to many Vietnamese bahn mi spots in America, the atmosphere was super relaxed for a quick eat, but inviting enough for a sit down to merit a heavier fare. I saw someone eating a grilled fish dish which looked super legit and had me eating with my eyes on the way out. The only drawback is during the busy hours, possibly avoid sitting by the counter because people will bump you as you eat. Bummer.",

I found the baguette nice and crunchy, in spite of my being there in the evening, when you'd expect bread would have been much harder by then. I tend to find Vietnamese coffee incredibly sweet, even when I've opted for the iced option (which has the effect of diluting the coffee as it melts), but, this wasn't too sweet at all, and, in fact, tasted pretty good. Staff were nice and smiley, and there was a fair amount of seats, as well as assorted copies of The Times for your reading pleasure. I'm definitely coming back. I loved the banh mi and I think it's the best that I've eaten so far (though I haven't been to Vietnam yet, I'll admit).",

There's a good range of drinks, lunch boxes, salads and soups. The setting is simple but attractive and comfortable enough.

Just be warned if you go for the ones with the chilli sign you will get chopped whole chillies which can be a bit of a shock if you're not expecting it. (Visit - 18/06/2015 Takeaway)",

We took a look at the menu written on the board and we were ready to order. We wanted to try a couple of mains and duck rolls to share. Well, what can I say when we tried to place my order? the waitress was in another world. She made a mistake with the order twice, she forgot to order the rolls (and she didn't do anything about that later, not even apologize). So we had to order again. I never had this kind of experience with a waiter/waitress before (and I had been myself waitress for a couple of years!). It was unbelievable.We got our food (finally). The duck rolls were OK, a little bit salty, but tasty enough. I ordered 'Chicken Katsu with new potatoes and lemongrass'. Not a big deal really. I had it better, but I was really hungry so I didn't complain. My friend ordered 'Roast Meats' (served with roast duck, crispy pork belly and char siu roast pork with seasonal steamed greens on rice). Apparently, it was better than mine (she was really happy with it!). Maybe I should have tried the famous 'Banh Mi' (Vietnamese baguette), but I'm not really sure if it will be a next time.",

Crusty, but not too hard baguette, crunchy daikon and cucumber, succulent meat, some chilli heat, and corriander = a really tasty bahn mi! If you work or live in the area, definitely check this place out. There have some seats, but this place is mostly take-away. Cash only!!!!!",

Their shop is so sleek and cute with a great seating area and a very colourful menu. The service can't be faulted but... and this is a big BUT, when it comes to their food I've had better.The pork bahn mi (the classic I always try to go for first) was really fatty and lacking in real chilli. I loved their pickled veg and the bread was nice but seemed less fresh than other places I've had. Also, they weren't very generous with the coriander. Never a good start. Saying that, I did enjoy it and as the surroundings are so lovely I'll probably will be back. They also have a really extensive menu so I really want to try the other yummies on the menu.They dod breakfast sarnies which I can't wait to go back and try and I think they'd be a lovely quick dinner spot in the area. It was a little pricey, but now that bahn mi is all the rage, I suppose that's expected, \u00a37+ for a sarnie and coffee.As for the coffee, I asked for it in a certain way, 'strong and sweet' - this means it should have a lovely mocha colour with ice cubes bobbing in the top. Here it was a little to dairy for me, more like my skin on a beach in Malta, whitey-beige. Still nice and refreshing but I've had a lot better in London. Keep up the good work K\u00eau! you're getting there.",

The bread and the ingredients in the sandwich were high quality- \u00a0I could tell that the meat, herbs and veg were all decent.Like other people noted, the Bahn Mi is under-seasoned. I like sandwiches with big flavours that push umami and saltiness to the edge. So to armchair chef (cuz it's Yelp), I think the vegetables need to be pickled slightly longer and I'd up the amount of fish sauce or nuoc mam sprinkled on the sandwich. I'll will likely go back since I want to try a few other menu items. Most likely in the the long run I'll stick to making my own bahn mi when I can (try the Momufuku cookbook recipe for a good one). I will however copy the bread used by Keu! as I thought it worked really well.",

    "text": "My boss and several coworkers head to this deli for takeaway several times a week, and rave about the deliciousness of their meal every time so I finally caved and bought myself a Roasted Spicy Duck Bahn Mi for lunch. I've personally been weary about trying Bahn Mi in the past; the Chicken Liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 in the classic version putting me off entirely. It was nice to see that there was variety of the menu at this location. The sandwich itself was tasty, although I don't understand the obsession or the reasoning behind the queue going out the door at lunch hour. k\u00eau! can definitely take credit for delicious small baguettes that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - I had no issue biting into mine and not coming away with a mouth full of cuts because of the hard texture. The filling though, it wasn't anything to write home about. I am a fan of duck, and it is normally a delicious addition to any sandwich, and it did blend well with the pickled veg and chilli included (don't worry, the fattiness of the meat and other vegetables, as well as the heartiness of the bread made the heat completely bearable for even someone who normally avoids chilli like myself), but it's really just a nice sandwich when it comes down to it. Better than your average mayo filled alternative from Tesco any day, but not as special as the many other asian-inspired dishes in the area.",

The girl who took my order was so sweet. She wanted to make sure I could eat the dish so she and I agreed to have very little gravy on my rice. I almost fainted after trying my dish. So surreal because it was so damn good. Order this if you like chicken and curry. The chicken is the tender. The gravy is to die for! I liked!",

The baguette is different from the type of bread I am used to, but this bread was really good anyway. I was also a little skeptical about the Japanese mayo used, but it served as a very good substitute for the typical homemade Vietnamese mayo for Banh Mi's. Overall, it had some slight modifications from traditional ingredients but it worked out beautifully.Would definitely recommend for everyone to try the Classic if you're into it.(Also had Iced Vietnamese Coffee and the Chicken Ginseng Soup. Both were good, but not mind blowing.)",

I've tried the roast pork belly and the classic, and the classic is the clear winner. They ask you if you want chilis on your sandwich, but beware as these chilis are spicy! Classic banh mi, vietnamese iced coffee, and bottles of ORIGINAL Huy Fong sriracha on the table. Only thing that would make me happier is if 1) they extended their delivery range on Deliveroo, and 2) wrapped my banh mi in wax paper with a rubber band for nostalgia.",

    "text": "It does not surprise me that Keu & Cay Tre are the same institution. Why? Because they are both kinda 3-stars. Super average, tough totally AOK. All of the right elements (service, hot food, clean, fast), but are lacking that extra little sumpin' sumpin'.So, no 4th, or even 5th star. Why? The flavor. Everything I've had at Cay Tre is pretty bland (separate review to follow, of course). I thought Keu might be a bit different (bahn mi -- so easy! so fresh! so much flavor!), so last night we popped in for a few sandwiches, a steamed pork bun and some duck summer rolls, ginger beer and a VIet Iced Coffee. The Iced Coffee was the best out of the bunch! First, 1.50 for the Steamed Pork Bun is am abomination. It was falling apart, really small, and really boring. 50p max for the quality, max. The duck summer rolls were AOK. Nothing special, but the dipping sauce good. No issues there. I had the kimchi BBQ pork bahn mi, and he had the Roast Duck. Mine was annoying in that the meat in a banh mi sandwich should be shredded so it doesn't all fall out while you are chewing through the baguette. Mistake 1. Mistake 2: between the strong flavor of kimchi and BBQ pork, it somehow resulted in zero flavor. I'm not even sure how this is possible, but it is. My pal-husband-friend agreed on his. All in all, filling -- but not overly exciting or something where I'd be rushing back. Almost felt like fast food or something... So there you have it. Will try to check out Banh Mi 11 next time we've got a craving and see how that goes, but I'll probably be ending my lukewarm love affair with Cay Tre/Keu after last night. Just so blah. Except for a Viet coffee...except for that. Yum.",

The fillings are well considered, bursting with flavour, and very generous portions! I'm a particular fan of the Kimchi BBQ pork, which has a fantastic sweet&sour spicy kick, but every single baguette I've eaten here has been mouthwateringly delicious. The salad, buns and summer rolls are also a delight. The staff are so sweet and smiley, and super quick. The only slight negatives; the salads could do with being a little big bigger, and some gluten free baguettes would be a real bonus. Otherwise, YUM!",
