    "text": "We arrived at Baileys around 5:45pm on a Tuesday and it was already packed! We waited for a few people to pick up their take-away order, and we were able to sit at the counter facing out to the window. We ordered a medium size cod, large size cod to share, large chips, green salad, and coleslaw. The green salad was beautifully arranged and it tasted great. The fish fresh, hot, and the batter stayed crispy. My husband really liked the coleslaw - probably the best he's had. It wasn't too watery and they make it fresh there. The service was great as well. My husband ended up getting the pineapple and apple fritters as well. Such a great meal at a reasonable price. Total for the 3 of us was \u00a318.55.",

And they have maybe 12 wall seats BUT this place is special. The fried fish was amazing and the cole slow was tart and delicious. Being American the chips weren't to my liking but I think that's more of a cultural thing than quality. Portions were very ample at the medium. A must go if you have time.",

It was cold, dark and I thought I was better with my blanket and telly than venturing out. How wrong I was!We arrived there on Saturday evening and there were 4 lovely employees (I guess some of them were the owners as well) in really good mood and looking efficient. \u00a0They have a quite extense menu for a take away and I saw plenty of things I want to try next time: scampi, calamari, cod, plaice, haddock, chicken... I think you get an idea.The place was quite busy with what seemed, regular customers. I know that because the guy taking the orders was chatting to them like if they were friends. There are three little tables, but not the perfect place to have a relaxed dinner. Altough the touch of the flowers helps! We have to wait for our food for around 5 minutes and the food boxes weren't closing due to the amount of \u00a0food inside. The pieces of fish are just obscene. And the chips? I even regret asking for them, I was so full with half a fish burger that I could not eat more than a couple of them. But yes, they were delicious and the bag was massive.I was quite surprised to see they also have organic ice creams.I would come back for sure although it is not on my way at all. There should be more service like that all around the world, they are so nice!!! :)",

When we travelled in Great Britain we ate at at least 7 fish and chip places in Wales, Scotland and England and this one beat them all. What else could you ask for? Indeed I will be going here every time I go to London. It's especially good but crowded before or after a Chelsea game. The shop is on a residential street and the sign is on the discreet side so it doesn't jump out at you but it's worth the search. Cheers!",

    "text": "Bottom Line: This is the best of London: Jovial staff, an intimate and relaxed atmosphere and hearty portions of the freshest fish and chips served up at a great price.The Food:The food served up at this hole in the wall is classically British: fried fish (haddock, cod), chips, meat pies along with other fried foods such as calamari and scampi. Dishes are simple and the restaurant focuses on delivering big portions at a reasonable price. The quality of the food is outstanding: the fish is piping hot and flaky but not greasy. Flavors are balanced and fresh - the fish fell apart in my mouth but did not taste fishy or overly fried. This carries over to the restaurant's other offerings - I am not a fan of calamari but the calamari served up by Bailey's was so good I'd order another in the future. The Atmosphere:Bailey's is a tiny restaurant with perhaps about 20 counter seats. This gives it an intimate feel and lends to the restaurant's authenticity as one of those holes in the wall that is a neighborhood secret. Staff at this family owned restaurant heartily welcome and tease visitors. At times, you feel like you're over at someone's home for a fish fry than you are at a restaurant. My mom and I visited after completing a long flight from Los Angeles for her first visit to London and the staff dazzled and delighted both of us. The Service:Service is laidback and is handled in a somewhat haphazard way. But this only adds to the place's charm. Multiple staff members waited on us and occasionally forgot what we had ordered. However, I would liken this more to being hosted at a friend's house and having his/her mom, dad, uncles and aunts wait on us rather than feeling like the staff was in over their heads. They were also incredibly gracious. After I declined to try the calamari and scampi, one of the owners was so excited we made his restaurant the first we visited in London, that he offered it us on the house. The restaurant also closes at 10:30 but we saw the owners let a bunch of people in up to 30 minutes after when they came knocking because they wanted to be accommodating.Location:Bailey's is in a residential area in Kensington. It's easily missed but highly worth the trip.Other Details:The restaurant takes cash and credit cards (not Amex). It could also easily get crowded - we were there at 10:15 but could see this place being filled for most of its opening hours.",

It had a high rating and it was a classic English dish so I figured it was worth a shot to try. I remember reading somewhere that in the UK, the fish and chips is better along the coast outside of London. I wish I had taken that advice more carefully. The fish was cod. I got the lunch special fish and chips which was a good deal. The fish had absolutely no taste to it. All I tasted was the heavy oil it was cooked in. I had to squeeze so much lemon juice on it plus tartar sauce plus the vinegar type sauce on the table to make it taste acceptable. The fries were great, but I'm expecting the whole meal to be good. The portion size for a lunch special was big so that was nice. Service was welcoming. Unfortunately, if I come back I will not get their lunch special again. Something else next time or a different fish.",

You pay after you eat. The food was very delicious, hot, and fresh. The fish was services with a wedge of lemon and tardar sauce.",

Used Yelp to find a fish n chip shop. This was the closest to our hotel. Fish and chips are cooked to order, served piping hot. We ordered two medium meals and I had pickled onions with mine. Chips are crisp, fish is crisp on the outside and bland. Think they are missing something in the batter. I doused my chips and fish with vinegar and yet couldn't taste the tang of vinegar. My suspicion is the vinegar was watered down. Going back to my part of town for some REAL fish n chips in the East End. Filling for what it's worth. Pickled onions were delicious!",

Around \u00a35 for a huge slab of fish with chips. Pies were around \u00a32.5/5 for the super friendly service. Chatted with the owner and he recommended the pie.3/5 for the location.

    "text": "My husband and I are visiting from NYC and came here tonight after seeing the great reviews on yelp. On this Sunday night I noticed a steady stream of people that kept pouring in. Everything was fresh, homemade, and delicious. We ordered the deep fried sausage, chicken and mushroom pie, cole slaw, chicken nuggets, and a small order of fish and chips. Deep fried sausage came with a lemon garlic aioli that was very fresh, light, and paired great with all the food. Please don't leave without trying the aioli. The chicken and mushroom pie was really flavorful. The chicken nuggets are really special and a must try. They are fried in a seasoned batter and are not your typical fast food nuggets. They are real pieces of super juicy chicken in a crispy batter. The fish and chips are great. We both ordered a small, but the portion was very very big. The fish, chips, and nuggets were fried upon ordering, and not sitting around. The man who takes orders gave great recommendations, and was very friendly. Baileys is good fresh food done right.",

This place is a \"miss\" by a mile. We went during a weekday mid-afternoon (perfect as everyone is working, so no one there) and had he place nearly ourselves. We loved the quaint seating arrangements, especially by the window where you can view the randoms waiting for the bus. Staff was fantastic. The food.......Ok, I'm not quite sure if there's a salt shortage or a general seasoning supply issue, but the cod was the most tasteless piece of fish I've ever had. No amount of doctoring could get the fish close to being with taste. I mean I dumped enough vinegar and salt for 4 people on it and I think I ruined it before I could get any taste out of it. The batter was mostly greasy, so I just ate the meat as best I could. The chips were actually pretty good (I'm a potato head) although equally tasteless but salvageable with salt. I don't know, man...if this spot is rated high, is there any hope for the other spots? Are the reviewers paid shills? Are the reviewers taste zombies? Only our first day so the search continues...",

The haddock tasted slightly more flavorful than the cod (which was also softer in texture.)

At first, I didn't think that I would be able to wait that long. Man am I glad that I did. Everything was well worth the wait! The fish and chips meal was fantastic. I added the works! Delicious mushy peas, creamy remoulade, sharp malt vinegar and a touch of their curry sauce! I ordered the large, not knowing what I would be getting myself into and ALMOST tapped out but I hung in there and cleaned my plate. We even somehow managed to save room for dessert! The customer service was what impressed me. How you make someone feel during an experience like this one will last forever. As soon we entered, Adam greeted with a huge smile and a welcome. He as well as the rest of the team went out of their way to meet and exceed our expectations! I'd fly back just to go back to Baily's!",

The fish is perfectly fried and goes great with their tartar sauce and some malt vinegar. The chips are fresh, crispy and delicious! I put some salt and malt vinegar on my chips and it was great with some ketchup. The atmosphere of Bailey's is great and their fish and chips are delicious!",

I was so excited to try this place after reading raving reviews online and it definitely did not disappoint. The fish was cooked to perfection and the chips were so fresh and crispy. Be sure to ask for the sweet chilly and spicy chilly sauce as they compliment both the fish and chips really well. The staff is also very sweet and welcoming.

There is no point for me to try and tell you which chip shop to go to but if you're near Chelsea and Fulham then make your way to this chip shop. The chips are so freakin good. Hot and crispy outside and fluffy inside. Quality continues with the cod fish fried to perfection. My favorite way to eat the chips was with a side of their aioli with hints of lemon and garlic. The cod was best with vinegar and plenty of salt (I don't have hypertension...yet ha). Though ketchup and tartar sauces are available at table side. I really enjoyed their fried calamari. It had a soft tender inside with a breadcrumb crust..yum with a couple of squeezes of lemon wedges. Thank you Baileys Fish and Chips for the perfect start to my trip. 4whisks",

The staff are really friendly and the atmosphere is pretty cozy. It's a small space, so seating can get a bit cramped, especially since it's pretty popular and busy every day. You get a pretty generous amount of food for the price; I felt this was one of the cheapest places in London that I actually enjoyed getting food from.The food appears to be largely made to order, so there is a bit of a wait. The savory pies appear to be ready to go. A small cod and chips is plenty of food for 1 person; you could probably even split the chips. I also tried the pineapple fritters, which were so tasty and definitely a great treat.Note that they charge extra for non-British bank cards. The shop is a 15-minute walk from the Fulham Broadway tube station.",

The coleslaw was ehhhh but everything else was perfect. Make sure you make this stop after the game.... and thank me later",

To me, this is best fish and chips in the LAND. Well, the chips are just okay (if they were Belgian style frites, tho) You get a huge chunk of moist fish, flaky flavorful crust. The vinegar here is tasty too. Don't forget to order a vat of curry for your fries! The folks working here are really nice! Worth the trek for sure!",

We got a spot in the window bar area and watched as a plethora of different customers came in and out while we ate. I honestly couldn't tell whether they'd been in a thousand times or if it was their first visit; the service was really that good.The prices are good, the owners are lovely, and the food is great whether you're fresh off the plane or five beers in.

HUGE!!! Fish was sooooo good... There are only 10 places at the tables but I highly recommend to wait in line or take fish&chips take-away. Our meal (for 5 person) consisted of 5 portions of fish&chips (cod and haddock), one sparkling water and 2 bottles of lemonade. Total bill was 43\u00a3. Not bad. Not at all. We couldn't finish our portions (a little bit too much) so 5 km back to hotel was exactly what was needed. :)",

After some research came to know about this place called Bailey's. That time Bailey's had 5 reviews and 5 star. So I was very skeptical about this place. But took my chance, headed over to this place. When I reached the place, my first impression of this place was not very good, very very small. But amount pick-up orders were pouring in, encouraged me to enter the place. surprise surprise, there is no table, they have this wall mounted sections, where you can keep your food and eat. I ordered one Cod and one Haddock and right away every one started to give me a look. That time I had no idea what I was getting into. After few minutes of wait, I was served my most memorable fish and chips of my life. Fishes were humongous. I was very very hungry, so I fished the food withe ease. Delicious, delicious and delicious. Not getting intimidated by the looks of place and going in was worth it. If you are anywhere near Fulham and Chelsea, just visit this place.",
