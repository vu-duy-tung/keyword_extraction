There have been times when I have eaten here on not so busy afternoons, and I and whoever I am with have been escorted to our table and given all the time we need, and on the other hand we have been briskly walked to our table and rushed into ordering, and with so much on its menu, it is difficult to choose and you need that time unless you are a regular who knows the menu.Michelin restaurants of Le Caprice's reputation can get away with treating guests like this, but it does get a little annoying when they arrive with the bill as soon you have finished your meal.As for the food I have had there and the dishes that I saw other people ordering, they all look great and surprisingly quite generous in size. I have been a few times and my favourite meal has been the Roast rump of Venison, I hadn't had Venison in a long while and it was absolutely delicious. I would recommend this restaurant for a treat anytime, but would also say go early.",

    "text": "I've been to Le Caprice twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and enjoyed it a lot both times. Le Caprice is a classy place that hasn't lost its little 'je ne sais quoi', despite recent changes to the kitchen and the fact that it is a bit of a dinosaur in the London dining scene. I like the simple design, the classic cuisine, the precise kitchen, the warmness and professionalism of the staff and the fact that you can eat comfortably at the pleasant bar counter. It is often little touches that make the biggest difference, and the doorman with bowler hat, the piano man who has no written music and chats to regular customers while playing, and the polished front-of-house act help to make Le Caprice a restaurant at which I hope to have many happy returns with my friends and family...or just alone for a cheeky long lunch at the bar.

Each dish looks like a piece of artwork - you almost are afraid to destroy it. Unfortunately last time I have been there, I chose steak tartar - it was not presented well nor spiced enough. Disappointed my eyes wondered to all other tasty looking dishes. Lets leave steak tartar in Paris; they know how to do this over the pond. One of those moments, you would like to pick from your neighbours plate - which I did. The scallops looked delicious as well as the tiger prawns.The kitchen closes at 11pm, why not go to Billy Elliot's Musical before hand - my favourite musical and I am not particular a big musical fan. This musical is based in Victoria and from there you can have a romantic walk passing Green Park and Ritz Hotel and arrive still in time for a small light dinner.",

Unfortunately, I had the most abysmal service there a year ago. I was treating someone to a business dinner and had the staff interrupt me four times to ask when I was giving back the table (they only wanted to allow 1.5 hrs). In the end, they denied serving us dessert and asked us to leave and free up the table. Never have I been so incensed at the lack of accommodation and the rude manner in which they handled everything.",

My food was very memoriable......a fresh questy squid salad, really good and i am not easliy impressed! The main course was salmon fishcake with spinach & sorel sauce, this was rich, creamy and was mostly salmon. I was very satisified by it! The wine was nice too. The service was quick, not fussy and despite other people complaining that they felt rushed, I didn't feel this at all. The restaurant itself is relaxed, with a piano player and a jazzy kind of feel. I would recommend this place for a birthday or a special occasion with friends. Also lots of celebs go here so people do tend to look around a bit trying to spot someone famous but that all adds to the fun!",

It is always hard to get a table - presumably because it's rammed with celeb spotters and celebs that don't know any better - so book in advance. Service is good even when busy, and despite the well-heeled crowd the staff are not snooty. The wine list is comprehensive, but expensive. However, the food is what lets La Caprice down - overpriced and uninspiring. There are too many nondescript dishes for transatlantic visitors with no gastronomic sense of adventure, and even the more interesting choices are just not that special. You are paying for the kudos of eating there, not for quality - there are better, cheaper restaurants elsewhere. All that said, we did see Alan Sugar on one visit and Peter Stringfellow on another.",

I mean even the simplest places have had great service! Too many waiters were all over each table. One main waiter is how to make a true connection. We were never offered a second cocktail. They don't give bread plates so we awkwardly put our bread on the table. We were asked what we wanted to eat 4 min after sitting down. Never asked if the food was to our liking. Requested tap but got charged for Evian water? (Charge was removed when questioned...) Can anyone explain the 4 pound \"cover charge\" that was put on our bill with no warning? We asked (of course). Apparently the \"top three restaurants in London have been around since the 1940's\" and want patrons to pay an allowance to Le Caprice so they may put white cloths on each table. Yeah... The manager said that was the reason! Times must be tough! We were NOT impressed. Good food doesn't cover for all that mess. Happy twenty-fifth anniversary to us!

For main, I ordered the lobster roll and loved it. It was just the right portion and flavor, enough to satiate my big appetite but sophisticated enough to differentiate it from your average NYC food truck version. The service was good, and the pianist that played the piano on-and-off added to the overall experience as well. Great place to go for adequately fancy dates and family dinners, I'd say.",

    "text": "Ok, so there is a 4 pound cover charge which seems odd; wouldn't it make more sense just to raise the prices a bit? However, this \u00a0was the best meal that we have had in London. We had eaten at Gordon Ramsays place the night before and had a good meal and a great waiter, but this food was superior. (BTW Ramsay's restaurant had a cover charge as well-perhaps this is now the standard in London) The seasoning was exactly right, the food was hot and done to perfection. \u00a0Even the sides were amazingWe walked in without a reservation on the recommendation of the concierge at the Ritz; though they will full, they created \u00a0a table for us. Service was personal and great. We were impressed to see waiters supported by all hands on deck. I had the duck done perfectly as was my wife's sea bass. The cappuccino was as good, if not better than our favorite place \u00a0in the North End in Boston. We had to stay for dessert and we were not disappointed. We shared the sampler plate and each treat was delicious.",

Lovely interior, nice photos on the wall, very welcoming staff.I started with a very good radicchio, artichoke, Parmesan, and pomegranate salad, well dressed, nicely plated, a good dish. A glass of Pouilly Fusse was a good accompaniment.For main I went for the Steak Tartare, which was very tasty, not too cold so there was plenty of flavour from the beef. Very good thin chips and a salad were the sides, to drink we enjoyed a good Gigondas.Small selection of cheese was a bit of a disappointment, but a very good 1974 Armagnac was a perfect end to the meal.I will return.",

We started with a fresh fish sashimi and steak tartare, the sashimi was very good but the tartar not so much. The tartar tasted like if it had a bit too much ketchup mixed in it. Then i had the squash risotto which was very bland. The service was very good and it is the only reason why i am giving them 3 stars. Will be back in London soon and may give it another opportunity.",
