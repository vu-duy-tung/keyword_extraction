I have been eating here whenever in London for years now, and not a trip goes by without at least one meal from Randall & Aubin.The food is never ordinary and always exquisite! I am the type of eater that orders the same favorites in the same reliable restaurants, but here I prefer the daily specials because I know they will not disappoint and I can't stand the thought of not trying a new dish by these wonderful people. The place is tiny, gay-friendly, with bar seating. The decor is simple and appealing. The staff are . . . gorgeous! \u00a0It is always packed to the brim with a long wait, even on week nights. I go for lunch or early dinner to ensure a pleasant experience.Tip: you don't have to order anything extravagant here in terms of seafood (lobster, crab, oysters, etc.) The usual fare is not so usual and quite delightful. I even look forward to the warm bread, butter, and olives they bring to the table. Everytime I leave London, I pray that they will still be there when I get back. Looks like they will!",

Wander past the old timber-framed cafe on any given lunchtime and be tempted by the piles of fresh prawns, dressed crabs and whole langoustines and lobsters. On no visit have I been left waiting for a table nor wishing for a bit more of an atmosphere - there always seems to be a wonderful buzz to the inside with the just the right size of crowd tucking into their moules frites or fresh oysters. Good belgian and continental beers, and, naturally enough, an outstanding wine list. I haven't visited at night, but I can imagine it gets pretty hectic.",

    "text": "Without hesitation I'm giving R&A five stars and am frankly surprised that so many reviewers have given it four. Either way this should tell you something about the location, atmosphere, decor, food and service here. Pretty much faultless. In a sense what is so lovely about this place is that it doesn't try too hard to be a great little find, it simply is. Smack in the middle of seediest Soho, with huge windows looking out at the hoardes of mashed up lunatics and uber cool freaks that parade the streets, it has a buzzy atmosphere even on a rare quiet day. Original Victorian butcher's tiles clad the walls, adorned with stylish black and white photographs, then wrought iron meat racks and hooks looming overhead. An unexpected yet effective combination. Then for a total curve ball, how about throw some disco balls in to the mix? This timelessly maverick eaterie embodies all that is Soho about Soho. Crustacea and funk executed with elegance, how can it possibly work? I have no idea, but it does. If you ever meet a friend in town and they're feeling down or upset about some trivial matter, bring them here for oysters and champagne or a bone dry white and I guarantee you their spirits will be lifted. Seafood platters are a speciality and being something of a pescetarian that suits me just fine, although the unfussy menu caters to many tastes with lamb, veal, steak, sausages, pork and chicken all putting in an appearance. Vegetarian? Forget it. Notable successes include the native or rock oysters, Cornish crab terrine (no longer available) beef carpaccio - so light and delicate, roasted halibut which was amazingly tender, soft and flavoursome, cooked to the perfect temperature. A solid wine list to wash down this oceanic sustenance. Their Gavi di Gavi is bliss in a bottle as is the Saint Clair NZ Riesling. R&A is noisy, bustling, cool and reassuringly antiquated. Where they've succeeded is as much in what they haven't done as what they have done. For example resisting the urge to shake cocktails or bring in a dj or start overworking the menu for example by catering to vegetarians. No such folly here. Ok yes it is a bit pricey but do you ever get what you pay for? Yes! Frankly in my opinion restaurants in London don't get much better than this. Long may R&A reign supreme.",

When arriving we were greeted with a small queue, which I was told wasn't bad as the queues generally a lot longer. A lovely waiter welcomed us with a wonderful smile and took our drink order while still in the queue. He then bought us out a glass each of wine and kept our bottle cooling inside until we were seated.When entering the restaurant I found a lovely atmosphere with house music playing in the back ground. All the staff were very friendly a happy. We ordered 12 oysters and 2 sides as we weren't that hungry after snacking at another bar before going to R&A. Prices weren't too bad considering the location. Our food was wonderful but we both felt quite jealous when seeing the seafood platter the people next to us had ordered. Good reason to visit again very soon :)Only thing I would have changed was the plating of the oysters as we choose two different types but they were plated together so we had no clue which was which. Apart from this I enjoyed my experience, would definitely go back and recommend to others. Great place!!!",

    "text": "Ok, so this is a damn fine seafood restaurant situated slap bang in the middle of Soho. With dance music pumping to almost nightclub level this is a camp, fun experience epitomised by the gigantic mirror-ball which hangs from the ceiling. So, why so mean with the stars Simon? Sounds like your kinda place? Answer - yes, on paper it does seem like my kind of camp, over the top fun restaurant but in reality the experience was middling to average at best.The interior is cramped and the seating resembles several breakfast bar stools and tables which are closely packed together. Which would be fine, if the prices on the menu reflected this less than comfortable and to be honest more canteen style of eating. In reality the prices are high and the portions (on the whole) are small - the exception being my partner's crab linguine which was loaded with way too much pasta. My scallops were over cooked which was \u00a0a shame as the fennel set it off well. Our friend's tuna with roasted vegetables looked good, but again the price / portion ratio just didn't match up. Best thing about the meal was the crab starter which was delicious and the definite highlight.So, throw together the high prices, uncomfortable seating and management / waiting staff with zero personality and it was just an ok experience, hence just three stars. It's definitely an experience dining at Randall & Aubin's and if you're flush with cash you may find it a nice little regular place to grab some high-quality seafood before a night out in Soho. As a destination restaurant to spend your hard earned cash at - I'd probably avoid. There are better places where you'll get more bang for your buck. Randall & Aubin should watch out though, if they don't improve the food for every single plate, then they could easily go the way of that other dance-music blasting restaurant, Balans - and that's downhill...",

The location of the restaurant is right on the adult strip of Brewer Street but it's worth braving the glaring neon lights and hustlers on the street corner to take a look at this establishment.Its 2 main strengths are an extensive fresh seafood menu and a rotisserie. In the summer, when they open the doors and windows and the music spills out onto the pavement, you can also get the wonderful smell coming from the chickens on the spits, slowly barbecuing and caramelising. There is also a very tempting array of fresh seafood on ice by the window to gaze at and salivate.I've enjoyed different styles of meal, all yummy. A tower of fresh fruits de mer served on crushed ice definitely makes it look, feel and taste like a celebration. Or a gorgeous, moist and tender rotisserie chicken for a quick meal.So, make sure that there isn't a Google Streetview car passing to take a picture of you in this dodgy part of Soho and head here for a slap up meal.",

I've often passed on a Friday or Saturday evening and it's heaving with people waiting to be seated and those being served.They serve everything to a seafood lover's delight in here form Oysters to Lobsters and all the fresh fish in between - yum. And the best thing is, despite its' central London location, the food always tastes totally fresh from the sea!This place comes highly recommended by me if you are a fish lover. Maybe a Mon-Weds lunch / dinner would be a little less busy but nevertheless, the wait is always worth it!",

    "text": "Tucked within one of the streets of lively Soho, Randall & Aubin is an interesting little French Charcuterie and Boucherie which serves up some decent seafood and a range of rotisserie cooked meats. \u00a0I've tried their Half Grilled Lobster with garlic butter and pommes frites, and it was lovely. Quite messy to eat, especially if you eat it like me, where you really get down and dirty and try retrieve every bit of meat possible, from the main body to the claws. The garlic butter is absorbed right into the juicy white meat of the lobster, and tastes even better having been washed down with a sip of one of their Sauvignon Blancs (be sure to have a graze through their wine list which hosts an interesting choice). Another time I went I had the Smoked Haddock and Salmon Fishcake with hollandaise and the soup du jour. The fish cakes were just right, but the only thing I remember about the soup was that it was too salty. So this meal was a bit hit and miss.I would definitely go back for the lobster, however at \u00a316.50 for half a lobster, the price is pretty steep. Oh and be prepared to have to raise your voice quite a bit if you want to hear what your company has to say as the music is really loud and you almost feel as if your in some sort of night club!",

Randall & Aubin's is an expensive restaurant on Brewer Street, just down from Mdme Jo Jos. There's often a queue but I don't think you can book ahead. Seating is stools and tall tables/bars, you're unlikely to get on a real table if there are only two of you. Service can be a bit snooty, but the overall fabulous disco experience kind of makes up for it. The menu includes lunchtime baguettes filled with chicken or steak or similar, lobster and fries, various seafood elements (they have a fresh counter), amazing herbed rotiserrie chicken which is very melt in the mouth and various steaks. Mains are around \u00a312 and I've never had a bad meal. I'd really like to try their lunchtime baguettes though.",

Last autumn I was queuing (patiently, for me) outside for places to become free for 3 of us (and watching out for queue bargers intent on cheating, which the good-natured, hip and energetic staff were efficient at politely controlling) when one of the waiters came outside with a tray-full of glasses of chilled champagne for those of us waiting on the pavement ~ what a nice touch and good business! I've only ever eaten shell-fish there, which is always fresh and perfectly prepared; its a small restaurant and it gets really busy, but the service is always attentive and humorous, whilst remaining professional; the wines are kept deliciously cold. I can't recommend it more highly.",

Good varied menu with lots to choose from, especially when you see the day's specials, too. Great soho spot (minus the typical brothel across street)!",

Even though it's crowded and you might have to wait 45+ minutes on a Friday night, you'll feel taken care of the entire time. Order some wine and make a friend.All our food was delicious. While they don't have many vegetarian options (not that I'd expect them to in a seafood restaurant), they did have some great egg dishes and veggie sides. I made a meal from that and didn't feel like I missed out on a thing without having lobster. My dining companions had lamb and pork dishes. The pork was reportedly a little fatty for their liking, but yummy nonetheless.I highly recommend a stop here for dinner before heading out around Soho.

Hailing from the SF Bay Area, you'd think we have a ton of great seafood places to nosh at. Not so. We have decent places, but nothing to rave about. Randall & Aubin is a place to rave about. Laid back, casual atmosphere (a bit cramped, but okay... I can deal with that). Food is absolutely spectacular in taking basic, fresh ingredients and letting them shine without any fuss.I will be back again and again!",

Randall & Aubin definitely has a good selection of wines (crispy Japanese and sweet-ish Australian - as we had a fair bit of those, I don't remember the names).It was warm that evening and they left the windows opened - it was absolutely lovely. Good music - but at a reasonable volume - I didn't have to shout to be heard.Seafood platter was enough for us both. And I loved the snails - probably the first time I had those without usual garlic and butter! Desserts - sadly, I can't have dairy so couldn't have something sophisticated, but my almond & rasberry tart was nice.I am definitely goin back there again.",

Sea bass and tuna (I think) on the next few visits were just as enjoyable. Location was very convenient. Walk from the Leicester tube station through China town was a breeze then when in town straight from the city-of-walking, Singapore. After a decade in the-city-of cars, Atlanta, interested to find out just how close (or, far) R&A may seem from the same tube station.All in all pleasant memory.

Countless reviews in restaurant guides had enforced a strong image of quality in my head a long time before I tested it for myself. And you know... gosh darn it they are right.The atmosphere upon entering was very buzzy, to the point that is was hard to gauge whether we would be able to grab a table without reserving. I guess that is a little ploy on Randall & Aubin's behalf though - seat as many people as possible in front of the impressively large windows to purport the image of an uber-popular Soho eatery. When I was presented with the menu, it really did take me a while to get to grips with it - which I assure you was not a bad thing! The delights on offer are definitely weighted toward swimming creatures, but do not by any means exclude the animals that stand around in fields and barns. I always enjoy having a tough time deciding what to have from a menu - it gives me an excuse to return to the restaurant if I like it!My friend that I was there with suggested that the fish and chips was a solid option, and having been deprived by the City of Angels for numerous months, I went for the British institution. We also ordered a started to share from the special board - tempura prawns with sweet chili sauce.When the prawns arrived, I was eager to try, however, the batter on the prawns was far more goujon than tempura and the sweet chili sauce seemed like it came from Lidl. However, all was saved when the F&C's arrived. Tasty fish and amazing sweet mushy peas were a treat. However, the chips were the sort you could see alongside any meal from Wetherspoons and the fish was the runt of the litter. SO. All in all I enjoyed my trip to Randall & Aubin and would return. But I would love the next meal to match the style and atmosphere of the place. That really would be a \"Woohoo 5 star affair\".",

Situated in the middle of Soho we knew Randall and Aubin would be aiming to pull in the pink pound a little but in all seriousness I think this place out-gays Graham Norton dancing to the Scissor Sisters in Heaven Nightclub. When our waiter arrived to show us to our table it was impossible not to notice how ripped his mussels were. I say impossible because he was wearing a shirt at least two sized too small for him and none of the top buttons were done up. We walked past the giant disco ball which hangs in the middle of the room and climbed up on stools to reach our white marble table. It was at this point that the music kicked in and Kylie came on to serenade us with pop classics such as 'I should be so lucky' and 'Spinning Around'. It was hysterical and completely unlike any other restaurant I'd ever been to. I loved it! To eat I ordered the rotisserie chicken and my boyfriend the lobster. Although they were both very tasty, we did find them slightly over cooked and a little chewy. However, I would forgive Randall and Aubin anything for all the entertainment it gave us. A great night out!",

It was enough for everyone and we got to try a couple of French/England/Ireland oysters. Yummmm :D This place is known for the seafood so I would recommend going for the seafood entrees. If you're a girl with a small appetite like me or not super hungry, I would recommend sharing the entree with a friend. Entrees are around \u00a320 so it can get kind of pricy if you order wine on top of that. We got the grilled sea bass. The fish was fresh and I liked the potatoes with curry sauce a lot - really unique. In the end we were really full but still ordered creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was on fire!! That was really cool but the actual taste wasn't so special (I've had better). There is usually a long line so come early. Not good for groups more than four people. The music is really loud so don't bring your children here. Overall, loved my experience here!!",

I informed the waiter who said he was sorry and took it away. \u00a0The Maitre d' then brought my dish back with one of the pieces of sole torn apart and said the chef had gone through it and couldn't find any bones and asked if I would like to continue eating it. I must have made a face because frankly I was appalled that he thought to even ask me if I wanted to continue to eat something full of bones that had then been torn apart and strewn all over the plate. \u00a0He then offered to have them remake it and they did. My plate was brought back by the waiter with two pieces of sole with some garnish and that was it. I asked where the rest of the dish was and he said oh I don't know, took the plate back, and I had to wait even longer since I assume they tossed my original dish and had to remake it from scratch. Then they brought back the dish in it's entirety and I was finally able to eat. Meanwhile, my husband waited to eat with me this entire time. No one offered to keep his plate warm while he waited for my dish and it was cold by the time he got to eat it. \u00a0His tuna did not have a good sear and was a bit overdone in the middle. When I ordered my dish I expected the fish to have a crispy skin, not be breaded. It was an elevated fish and chips, except I never had fish and chips for that much money, nor have had to send it back for being full of bones, or dealt with such terrible service. \u00a0I was expecting for there to be some type of good will gesture made with the tab but I was charged full price for both meals. \u00a0Overall, this was perhaps the worst dining experience I have ever encountered.",

I was looking for a trendy restaurant in the SOHO area with good food and not too expensive in terms of prices and this place seems to be receiving the right number of stars and \u00a3\u00a3 sign so i gave it ago.No reservations, as expected, but also not much room for you to stand inside. It was cold outside :(We arrived on a Friday night at 6:30pm and waited for about 30m before we were seated. The place wasn't too big and the music was LOUD. So loud that you can barely hear yourself think let alone have a conversation.Service was fantastic - no complaints.Food was mediocre. We tried- Bellini (~\u00a39): tiny champagne glass made with dry dry prosseco. No good.- Oysters: sticks to the shell and not very fresh- Queen Scallop: I was excited about capers but the capers were super tiny and the scallops weren't too flavorful (~\u00a38)- Sole (~\u00a319): deep fried, kinda like fish and chips without the chips but with potatoes. The fish was okay but i mean if you deep fry fish it's hard to go wrong. The potatoes were really good and the string beans are okay.- steak frite: the server warned us that the steak was gonna be super tiny. Albeit tasty, it was not very satisfying- lemon tart (~\u00a38): too tangyHonestly, the food is mediocre, but the entire experience is marred by the loud music. Maybe they do that to kick people out because it's so busy in there.Unimpressed.",

    "text": "I was actually pretty excited to come here - I love seafood, I love swishy old-school spots, and I love the idea of an indulgent weekday lunch perched by the windows, watching the hectic world go by in Soho. So what fell short...First, the service started out strong. Had a nice welcome and offered a choice of tables. But our male server, while attentive, wasn't very helpful with the menu in terms of recommendations or specials. This became especially apparent with the wine list - which is excellent by the way, but undone because the staff didn't know their wines. Our server couldn't tell us a single thing about the two white wine specials, and then when asked for a fruity wine, he disappeared for several minutes to ask other staffers. In their defence, he did come back with three tastings of white wines, which was thoughtful, but then he couldn't tell us about any of them beyond which one tasted 'stronger' and which one did not. This was quite disappointing for a place that is known for wines, and particularly so when the wine selection was actually pretty impressive, including a delicious creamy white from Lebanon.Onto the food: the bread basket is worth every pence of the four pounds it costs - a selection of hot toasted brown and olive bread, along with butter and this anchovy cream that is unforgettable. The food itself was not very memorable. We had the fish soup, chilled seafood platter and the special crayfish truffle pasta. The soup was good but on the salty side, while the chilled seafood platter had highs and lows. Highs included the crab and scallop meat, while the lows were the three flat oysters provided, with very little meat on the shell. The pasta was delicious, just a few seconds cooked longer than I would've liked, but with lots of yummy shrimp and a delicious light sauce. All in all, I would come back to this place for some wine and light food, but wouldn't invest again in a full meal here. Maybe it's worth it for the atmosphere in the evening, but I would go elsewhere for a good seafood meal, especially at this cost.",

But it was delicious and it made for the most perfect dinner. Along with scallops with capers and fresh lime and a dressed crab this was a dinner date to remember.I love The Little Mermaid, I love Flounder and Sebastian - but seriously, when they taste this good I'd be first in line to see the plopped in the hot pot. Snuggled in the heart of Soho, opposite Cox, Cake and Kink, Randall & Aubin is something of a legend with a huge local following. There are beautiful gays serving and beautiful gays flowing out the door as well as seafood fans and some suit types. They have great window seats that are perfect for people watching and a great wine list, although it was missing a Chablis.This was a date spot for me, and it was pretty amazing. We ordered three main courses and one starter between two of us and while away a spring evening over a lovely bottle of plonk. When you are here expect to be pushed and shoved a bit, expect to pay over the odds but love it. This is London.",
