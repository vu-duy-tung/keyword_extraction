The food is wholesome and earthy: the smoked eel, the garlicky snails with bacon and superb rillettes are a must, but everything is worthy of consideration. The wine list is brilliant, sympathetic mark-ups, unusual but quite delicious natural wines many made with very low sulphur dioxide. This wine bar/restaurant is buzzing; the sight (and sound) of happy diners is proof of its success.",

Everything I tried on my visit was top notch and the bone marrow with truffle and mushrooms on toast was among some of the best stuff Ive had in the city. Also ordered a 'slightly sparkling' Italian white which had a distinctly off-pink hue - really lovely stuff and they do them in 500ml bottles too, so you can go ahead and try all kinds of different things in one go - awesome. Some people do complain about the rude service ( they are abit snotty to be honest) and the slow food (yeah it became noticable after it took the waitress 15 min to take our order and the wine only came when the rest of the food arrived) but on the whole, it's still a pretty amazing wine bar, well worth a visit for food and for wine. Price wise is so-so, the small dishes are not cheap (\u00a37 to \u00a39) and their dujours hover the \u00a313 mark. There is an option for a \u00a310 lunch plus a glass of wine, but aside from that - Terroirs is a real gem.",

    "text": "OK, now this is a strange review. I actually want to give this place five stars. Even though I didn't eat anything and I only had water. For fairly dull reasons, I'm off the booze at the moment (those of you who regularly read my reviews will be shocked by this). But, after coming out of the theatre last week and feeling like chatting about the fabulous show I'd just seen, I jumped at the opportunity to find out what all the fuss was about. All the fuss about this place is deserved. We perched at the bar, and felt instantly at home. I wished we'd got there earlier and had time to stay. Even at the bar it's the kind of place you could spend all night (although some bag hooks wouldn't go amiss). I did have a sip of my friend's Cote du Rhone and it was fabulous (organic too - their menu has little cows by the happy wines). Was mad at not being able to drink. The food smelled amazing, the bar staff we very handsome (especially the man with the curly hair) and they didn't bat an eyelid when I was drinking nothing but tap water. Dead sexy wine glasses too. I want to come back here and try everything. The bar snacks looked good value, the wine isn't that pricey. I'm smitten, and the only thing they've given me is a smile and a glass of water. Well done Terroirs, well done.",

The space is small, and the rustic wooden tables are very close together (it's quite easy to eavesdrop). The wine list is outstanding, and not only includes regular wines, but white and red \"wines of the moment.\" There are also small plates and pairings to go with the wine if you choose. We ordered a 750mL of Teroldego Rotaliano, which is an Italian wine from the Trentino region. After we let it breathe for a few minutes, it was absolutely divine. We also paired the wine with a few cheeses. Anyone who knows me should know that wine and cheese are the way to my heart. I could not have been more ecstatic. What I did not like (and have deducted a star as a result) was the stuck-up waitress. Not only was she condescending about the wine we selected, but she was also trying to one-up us on which cheeses to pair with the wine. Sorry, that doesn't fly with me!",

    "text": "Full review at thehappinessprojectlondo\u2026  This is up there with my favourite places for after-work dinner that isn't expensive, serves amazing food and lovely wine, and will let us chat and mange to our heart's content. I loved the rustic, arty, chilled French atmosphere \u00a0with people eating at the bar and the cute table settings. It felt friendly, cosy and relaxed \u00a0perfect. The menu is French tapas-style which I'm a huge fan of \u00a0there's nothing better than sharing food with friends and chatting about how it tastes, a real bonding experience. We ordered 4 cold/warm tapas and 1 larger hot plate between 3. We started with the duck rillettes; endive, gorgonzola & spiced walnut salad; snails, bacon garlic & parsley and king prawns a la plancha. Duck rillettes were gamey and fatty, delicious. Snails were salty, garlicky, earthy, and the endive, walnut and gorgonzola salad \u00a0a classic that I always love, but this was especially good due to the strong runny cheese and herby salad dressing.King prawns a la plancha was meaty, melt in mouthy, sweet and lovely sauce. For apres, we really stuck to our diet plans and ordered the bavette steak. It was really lovely \u00a0pink, tender beef and juicy roast potatoes on a bed of shallots. My only complaint was that I could have eaten more of it, and not sure about the crouton thingies that came with it. As expected in a French place, the wine list is great. I liked how you could order a 500cl bottle (pretty much half a bottle really and totally acceptable for a detox school night) \u00a0we tried the Jurancon which was really nice, but next time I'd like to ask their recommendations for what wine to try with the food. Oh yeah and then we had a bitter chocolate pot for pud. It was yummy \u00a0sticky, soft and rich. Then the bill came and all this lovely wine and food came to \u00a372 including service or \u00a324 each. It was at this moment that I decided to come back here every week and eat my way through the wine list and menu until the buttons pop off my jeans. We're definitely going back on a Friday for a wine and cheese fest for a start. I've eaten some pretty terrible meals round the corner for far more, so we really couldn't believe what great value this place was. Only downsides? Not sure veggies would find enough food on the menu \u00a0but this is pretty typical of French places, oh and you might have to book a table in advance for peak times, but what do you expect for this sort of value. I'd also probably order one more tapas plate to fill me up.",

    "text": "Terroirs - Pics at The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) A recent visit to Le Manoir de Raynaudes, in the South West of France, has re-ignited my love for French cuisine and all things French. I have since then signed up to French language classes and am devouring Julia Child's memoirs My Life in France. The best part of this francophonisation process was finding Terroirs, a French bar and restaurant opened in Central London about a year ago. Having been to Terroirs before, I normally try and sit at their zinc bar to watch the chefs at action and for a more relaxed dinner. The menu is short but offers an excellent spread of fish, shellfish, duck, cheese and charcuterie. This is a place to come with friends and share various dishes over a few bottles of excellent French wine. In my last visit, I ordered a small selection of dishes together with one of my favourite bottles of wine, a 2007 bottle of Marcillac @ \u00a318.85 (Dne du Cros, Philippe Teulier, Marcillac). Terroirs' wine list is most impressive - it contains about 200 wines of which 20 wines can also be served by the glass. You will be assured to find a bottle to suit every budget and taste. The menu is divided into 5 categories \u00a0Bar Snacks (Duck Scratchings \u00a32.50 are fatty but very moreish, Bread & Butter \u00a31.50, a must), Small Plates (for sharing like Steak Tartare \u00a37 or a Whole Dorset Crab and Mayo \u00a312), Cheese (Rocamadour \u00a33.50 is divine), Charcuterie (Duck Rillettes \u00a36 is one of my favourites), Plats du Jour (more substantial dishes like Brandade de Morue \u00a312 or Slow Roasted Belly of Pork \u00a313) and Desserts @ \u00a35. My suggestion would be to order bread and butter, which are heavy and chewy, accompanied by a selection from any of these categories. One of the dishes I order at every visit, is the Snail, Bacon, Garlic and Parsley @ \u00a37. This is served on a slice of toasted bread with a delicious Pistou dressing (just like Pesto but without pine nuts or cheese but more garlicky). The combination of flavours is sensational, I just wished there was more on my plate! Another favourite, Duck Rillettes @ \u00a36, is rustic French cuisine at its best, and better avoided when on any diet. Originally made with pork, the meat is cubed or chopped, salted heavily and cooked slowly in fat until it is tender enough to be easily shredded. It is then cooled with enough of the fat to form a paste. They are normally used as spread on bread or toast and served at room temperature. Potted Brown Shrimps @ \u00a37, also served on toasted bread, was very good. Seasoned heavily with nutmeg and paprika as potted shellfish should be, the flavours partnered well with the Morecambe Bay shrimps. The Pan Fried Girolles Mushrooms with a Duck Egg at \u00a37 was also delicious. The mushrooms were meaty and full of flavour, and the runny duck egg was an interesting addition. Other dishes that I had tried in previous visits and that I would also recommend are the Steak Tartare \u00a37 (well seasoned and fresh), Pork and Pistachio Terrine \u00a36 (quite rustic and a substantial portion), Selection of Charcuterie \u00a310 (nice cuts but not good value), any of the cheeses \u00a33.50 (they are all superb), and Duck Scratchings @ \u00a32.50 (fatty but very good). I have been impressed by Terroirs in all my visits. At \u00a353.27 for two including an excellent bottle of wine, this is one of my favourite restaurants in London at the moment, and I simply cannot recommend it enough. Verdict \u00a0Rustic, hearty and delicious French cuisine to share, and coupled with the best wine list in town. Great Service and reasonable prices make Terroirs one of the hottest tables in the Capital.",

    "text": "Terroirs has a lot going for it - more pluses than minuses, thankfully. It's so easy to get ripped off or be disappointed in London, so it's great to have a place that lives up - and down - to its reputation. So far the critics are divided, and I can see why. Good things first: super atmosphere, utterly delicious, gorgeous food, huge wine list with very attractively priced wines. It's decidedly French, but some dishes nod towards Spain. The food is its number one saving grace. The small dishes to share are intelligently priced, generous rather than picky, and frankly inspired. For example, the Basque piperade with chorizo was really rich and creamy, and the smoked eel intensely juicy and complex. Other slightly less accomplished dishes include the tartine of snails which was perhaps too garlicky but in general every dish we tried was harmonious and amusing and very easy to share between three people. Things to complain about: the service is erratic. Not so much the individual attitude, which is not exactly graceful, but its organisation (lack thereof). The place was packed, and it feels understaffed. Poor service is fairly consistentl across the UK - there just isn't a service culture here (as opposed to the USA, Spain, France or Australia, all with distinctive and laudable approaches to service) and sadly Terroirs is no exception, even if they are all French. Perhaps that is the reason, I don't know. The other reservation I have about Terroirs, paradoxically, is the wine list. The wines themselves are of a very high quality - the two we chose were near sensational - but the concept is devilishly difficult to absorb. The so-called natural wines idea - i.e. organic and/or biodynamic - is pretty problematic to start with (this is not the place to discuss it), but having to wade through a huge list that is organised in a way that is conflict with convention is totally tiresome. It took me 20 minutes to intepret and begin to see what sort of wines might be suitable for us. I had to read endless paragraphs in miniscule font size and flip from one page to another to grasp the context in order to find the marks of identity we all look for in wines to make an informed choice. Grape variety (practically unmentioned) and exact DOC would be a good start. Instead they appear to be reinventing French wine geography and group the wines according their idea of the natural wine landscape. This is really taxing on the person trying to make a choice. They should bear in mind that the New World has been very influential in making grape variety central to wine choosing, and it wouldn't hurt to list the varieties and their percentages next to each bottle. Asking for help, I just kept being told how good each wine I pointed at was, or they just repeated the name of the wine with better pronunciation. Hopeless. That said, the wines we did have were delicious. Recommended? In spite of these gripes, most certainly, yes. Great place.",

I came away with two bottles - red and white - of organic wine. I also had a wonderful conversation with a server from Spain, who spoke French very well as did the rest of the staff. I loved hearing the servers and hosts make quick exchanges in French as they attended to guests.Organic wine is not to be confused with biodynamic. Biodynamic wine is the product of vineyards that simply allow nature to tend to the grapes without any form of intervention - even irrigation is out of the question - so that the final yield is likely to be a lot smaller, and therefore you pay a pretty penny.Absolutely enjoyed poring over the wine menu. I was given gallant service, in the form of pleasant conversation and useful tips over selecting a wine. I sampled 2 to 3 wines for free before making my choices. Already opened the white over dinner with family celebrating my sister's graduation from law school. It was pure. Just liquid gold, smooth and excellent with a sweet finish. The beauty of this white is that it was bottled at least ten years ago, without the preservatives that have been argued as essential to keeping the wine.I am still waiting to open the red, a vino di anna 2007. It says on the bottle that it does contain sulfites, which I should \u00a0have checked earlier. I wonder if sulfites are additives or natural to wine as it ages? I had tried it at the bar though, and it 'smelled of the farm', just as my server had said. Loved it, can't wait to go back on my next visit.",

    "text": "It was 11:00 PM, we had just come from a concert at Cadogan Hall, and were absolutely starving. Two lost (and hungry) souls wandering the area around Embankment, looking for some good eats. After a few potential options, Terroirs appeared. The windows were steamy, the restaurant full, and the menu incredibly inviting.Even though it was late at night, we still had a 15 minute wait, which seemed to indicate the popularity of the place. Not only was the food well worth the wait, but we were able to order some top notch champagne to keep us busy while we salivated over all the food being served around us. Finally, we were seated, the real fun began.The beauty of Terroirs is that, while there are entrees to choose from, the menu is largely comprised of small plates. We ordered the pork & pistachio terrine, fresh bread and butter, the steak tartare, clams with garlic, the smoked duck with beetroot and hazelnuts, and a Floating Island to finish. Everything was absolutely amazing. The only reason why I docked a star is because we definitely saw a mouse run across the floor at one point. Weirdly enough, this didn't distract me from how good the food was -- I just convinced myself that we were sitting in a real life version of Disney's Ratatouille. Fooling myself? Probably. Still delicious despite this hiccup? Absolutely.",

With the sun shining, we sat in the window of the upstairs restaurant and pawed the menu with glee.My perfect way to eat, just order a selection of dishes and share away.We started with the duck rilletes (a coarse pate) and pork & pistachio terrine with bread. Both were absolutely divine, just the right side of salty, heavy on the meat and with little fat. The bread was crispy and fresh, with lashings of butter and a decent red to match.We also ordered a selection of cheese (both soft and hard), plus some mixed charcuterie. The quality of both was extremely high, and I probably could have sat there all afternoon tucking in. Sanity got the better of me though and I left feeling full, satisfying and happy to pay the bill.The waiter/waitresses were also very attentive, and weren't too upset when we realised we'd over-ordered and had to cancel a few dishes. That says a lot.I'll be back in a heartbeat!",

    "text": "First night in London, decided to find something in the Michelin guide because it's always great. And it turns out we found an excellent restaurant. While the guide said this place was pan-European, it turns out it was French. All staff and even the owners are French. There are a few non-French dishes, but the character of the place is definitely French. We spent the entire night speaking French with the incredibly friendly staff, and sort of forgot where we were. It was kind of strange to have a French person come and ask you (in English), \"So, how is your meal? Is everything ok?\" C'est pas francais. But it is excellent!The name of this place is well explained on a chalkboard describing their philosophy -- to find small-production wines that reflect the terrior of where they came from (the land, the culture, the winemaker) and many are biodynamically grown. The wine sets the stage, and the food is a beautiful compliment.We started with a great bottle of Spanish wine from the northwest region somewhat near the Duoro river. For your meal, you can choose starters (such as charcuterie, or cheese) which could also make a great way to have an after-work drink and snack. To this, you can add small plates or large plates. We decided to go with all small plates. The terrine with pistachios is excellently done, and bacon-wrapped. (French? Not sure. Delicious? Definitely.) But it did have cornichons on the side. Stand-out dishes included the crab (perfectly cooked, with delicious homemade mayo), escargot on bacon (yes, turns out there is a way to improve on the French classic), and mushroom (champignons). For a dessert, if you're loooking for something a bit lighter, try the St. Pierre (a pyramid-shaped goat cheese). It's plenty to share for two if you're not hungry.Gluten-free notes: So... the naturally gluten-free formula does not work here. The staff may be French, but the kitchen adds croutons. A lot of dishes come with with croutons or on toast. Be sure to ask. They are incredibly nice about it and very happy to make a crouton-free dish.",

There were five of us and we ordered seven sharing plates for the whole table. The food was so good that we soon went short and ordered more. I will only say that all of it was exceptionally delicious and beautifully presented.

    "text": "A lunch to talk about the Slow Food movement, where else could it be held? The organisation is fascinating, a rapidly growing federation of groups dedicated to pushing the Slow Food agenda and promoting the enjoyment and protection of locally produced food and styles of cooking. Entering the restaurant, despite the beautiful sunshine outside, I was shown down to the very back room of their basement restaurant. I'm sure it's gorgeous of a winter evening, but really not what you want on a sunny Friday afternoon and so I was very glad when the Maven arrived, took charge and demanded that we move back upstairs. The wine bar menu is short, though not annoyingly so, I'd eat anything on here. There are around 10-12 small plates and then another 4 Plats du Jour. We started with a shared plate of large, gently flavoured, almost sweet Cantabrian anchovies (from the region around Santander). Taken with a thick layer of butter and thinly sliced shallot on brown sourdough toast, they were a very worthy start.  \u00a0Of note, the Maven went for the whole Dorset crab, which looked to be a beautiful beast, but was served undressed (and this unmentioned in the menu or by the wait staff). It's not the biggest deal, and by the appreciative noises from the other side of the table seemed to be worthwhile, though it's certainly worth knowing before you order.The pork caillette for my main was a great call. It's a rustic p\u00e2t\u00e9 of pork, herbs and spinach wrapped in a thin intestine like a sausage or a squat haggis that comes from the Ardeche region of Southern France. Oven cooked and served with a thick, salty gravy, crushed potatoes and julienned carrots roast in (no doubt a locally sourced) honey it was a satisfyingly solid meal. With the talking, and the appropriately summery Corbieres, one star among many on a wine list I'll be back at very soon, we passed on desserts and, eventually, waddled off into the late afternoon sun.",

    "text": "Better than as good as it gets--transformative! \u00a0SIX STARS. \u00a0And I didn't use Yelp! to find them, but I am to register my enduring satisfaction.In my previous review lexicon I shared a 3 tier experiential rating on restaurants:1. Good enough to make me full2. I was entertained3. I've been transformedI tend to only comment on the last category of experience, those venues where service and comestibles come together to transport me to somewhere else more desirable than where I entered from.Terroirs is all that and more at every level.Ok, there is a context to this reverie: I missed my Eurostar chunnel train to Paris today. \u00a0And I was still hankering for a fine slice of French food, and it was then I happened upon Terriors within a few blocks of my hotel (and the sixth star I give here is that the restaurant is located a few steps from Trafalgar Square and the National Portrait Gallery).I ate lunch and it was delicious. \u00a0Yet their food was significantly improved upon by the depth of French door and waitstaff behaving as if I was a fine fellow--they greeted me with aplomb and welcoming smiles... even though I was clearly American. \u00a0And I suggest here that you will be immediately transported into a reverie of what eating great food in France could be all about but seldom is--welcoming. \u00a0So the beginning was good, but could it continue?Yes. \u00a0Added to the seemingly magical dispositions of staff was their great service (professional yet not intrusive) plus a simple elegance of the menu that clearly changed daily and seasonally by the ingredients available--ahhh, freshness and authentic feel at every level. \u00a0This is my great secret recipe for a real repast, for sublime sating. \u00a0And it was all here. \u00a0But that was lunch. \u00a0I felt so good about lunch afterwards that I was not sure if I imagined the whole experience (and wandering the National Portrait Gallery and staring into the sacred faces of Newton, Coleridge, Byron and Blake and Wordsworth did little to ground me)... \u00a0Perhaps I've reflected on a feverish distortion of reality? \u00a0I contemplated such uncertainties on return to my hotel.My colleague, a sincere Francophile and harsh critic of less than stellar success, returned later and we discussed dinner. \u00a0I was curious for confirmation so I suggested Terriors. \u00a0We went and she was equally delighted over dinner. \u00a0And so was I.So this led me to another theory about transformative food experiences:French food is actually less determined and damaged by place and provenance of ingredients--it is utterly dependent upon the skill of staff and chef to achieve alchemy, a complete transformation of raw ingredients into a much removed sublime complexity that is nearly ineffable. \u00a0Every plate was something delicious you could never imagine on a market counter--it was all in the combinations of ingredients, grace of preparations and delivery.This is a vastly different value proposition than offered by the best of other cuisines, such as Italian and the far eastern exotics that are utterly dependent upon local ingredients. \u00a0The successes of these cuisines are entirely made by getting out of the way of the ingredients through artistic simplicity--let that ripe tomato and buffala mozzarella smile with just a light touch of basil and olive oil, etc.So if you are hankering for simple goodness, linger where ingredients are grown and locally finessed; but, if you want sublime alchemy on a plate, then find wherever the French are actually living that mission to historical standards that have replaced modern cynicism and arrogance, or perhaps where they never existed in the first place.And that my friends, is a place called Terriors.",

    "text": "Brilliant rustic french dining! After reading the top reviews on here I suggested it for a quiet catch up with a friend. Reservations were easy to make via email (much preferred as its a bit awkward making reservations on the phone where all the work people can hear you and know you aren't working) and we were seated immediately. My main gripe with our table is that it was tucked away in a corner which was top points for privacy but hell when it came to flagged down the waitress. It took us almost 30 minutes to finally get our orders in despite asking a couple of the other staff if we could order.Sharing is caring, so we orded 3 dishes to dig into. To start, the pork & pistaschio terrine. This was one of the best terrines I've ever had. As Vikki C said, it's rich from a meaty sense with just enough fat to hold it together. The bread is fresh and crunchy (although why they needed to charge \u00a31.50 for it I don't know). The portions are quite big at probably twice what you'd normally get at a restaurant.Next up was the Tuscan chopped raw steak. It's basically steak tartare although a rougher chop and lacking the spice of the mustard or the raw egg. Super fresh tender meat that melted in your mouth so nothing to complain about there. I prefer tartare for the sharper flavours which would have helped with the terrine but still happy with it.Finally, we ended with the bavette (seared skirt steak) with roast cubed potatoes and chanterelles. This was my favourite with the meat bloody and juicy with a delightful charred crust on the outside. I loved the mushroomy sauce and proceeded to get extra bread to mop up every last bit. When the plate leaves cleaner than it was at birth, you know you enjoyed the dish.Other thoughts. It was pretty busy on a Wednesday night so I would recommend reserving a table if its for more than 2 of you. The upstairs and downstairs areas have different menus so check it out online before reserving. The wine list is ridiculously long but the waiters double as fairly knowledgeable sommeliers so be sure to ask for help if you need it. Price wise, it's quite reasonable for the size and quality of food (terrine and steak were each around \u00a38 and bavette was \u00a317...we were quite full).Overall, it would have been a been 5 stars except for the long wait at the start to order and being charged for bread and butter.",

(While I feel that this question is in some ways rhetorical, the answer is yes, I am that sort of person.)We walk in at about 5:30 on a Friday afternoon. There are maybe 10-12 people in the place. Two are at a table, one more is at a second table, the rest are huddled around the small bar. We tell the waitress there are two of us. We ask if we want to sit at the bar. Well there is clearly no room at the bar, so we say no, we'd like a table. She looks at the seating chart. The phone rings. She freaks out, looking back and forth from the seating chart to the phone, disgusted that the phone is ringing. Finally she says she can get us a table if we are gone by 7:30. I say that should be easy, as we just want a bottle of wine or two to warm up from the cold.Her response? The only way to sit at a table is if you're eating, and we have to go to the bar. We go to the bar. There is no room at the bar, so we just leave. I get that sort of response if the place is bustling with people, and there's only one table left, but they want to save it for someone who might be eating. I don't get it when practically every table is empty (probably due to their inane seating plans), and they are worried that the table won't be free in time. Clearly, it will be free in time, and clearly, if someone comes in sometime after us, you probably won't give them the table, because of your insane ability to figure out whether or not people will be finished in time.It's unfortunate, because we don't drink cheap wine. Seeing how empty the place was, our bottle of wine would probably have been enough to pay one of their employees for that hour, who were probably just standing around not working anyway.",

Although we did get seated about 15 minutes past our reservation time, the wait staff was attentive and friendly, they also gave us a fantastic table on the upper balcony that didn't feel like we were too close to anyone else.As it was just two of us, and we were there more for the wine and cheese/meat, we didn't get any mains but the food around us looked amazing. Next time, I want to order the tartare, the oysters, the steak? or pork chop... everything!We ordered: the mixed selection charcuterie, as well as the herve cheese - a strong softer cheese - (looks small, but we almost didn't even get through the whole piece) and the beetroot and goat cheese salad. That has to be one of the best beetroot salads that I have had. The goat cheese was whipped-like, light and absolutely delicious. ALSO the bread.. keeps coming!!!! And it was warm! Yum!Waitress recommended a couple of wines for us, and we took her recommendation and got white to start. It was a great choice and we loved it. Crisp and citrusy. I wish I remembered the name. We went by the glass and got two glasses each.Total pp was about \u00a325 each and we were more than full.Seriously cannot wait to go back....",

    "text": "A charming and atmospheric place for lunch. We were seated on the first floor, on one of the tables opposite from the expansive windows. Not only did we enjoy fantastic cuisine and warm friendly service, we were able to people watch Londoners going about their business from the comforts of our table.The food was elegant with each bite a treat for your taste buds. Yummy crusty bread with butter was presented to each table. We ate it with our order of Pecorino Saldo (Sardinia) cheese.A small plate of Duck Rilletes was a perfect amount to share. The duck was very tender and the cornichons helped cut the richness of the meat. The Snails on toast with garlic, parsley, and lardo was an incredibly rich and flavorful dish. Fragrant garlic, succulent snails, and heavenly lardo made this a filling excellent dish.We also had a plate of smoked trout (I think it was trout) that was on a plate of something crisp and green. It was a light and bright dish that we desperately needed after such heavy plates.Of course everything was washed down with a carafe of white wine from Terriors extensive wine list. I loved how the wines are sourced from artisan growers who cultivated the wine in a sustainable/organic/bio-dynamic fashion. The bill was about $70 USD. Not bad for wine, 3 plates, and cheese. The two of us were quite stuffed after our meal. Tourists around the National Gallery/Covent Garden/ Leicester Square should definitely meander towards here for an excellent dining experience. Terriors is well deserving of their Michelin Guide bestowed status of Bib Gourmand, a title given to restaurants that offer high quality food and service at a good value for budget savvy diners.",

    "text": "Terroirs has been on my to-eat list for a while, and when my friend told me that they had the orange wine that's become trendy and I've been dying to try, it became an immediate priority. It's just around the corner from Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden, and I must have walked by it dozens of times, but had never realised it was right there. We went on a Monday night and managed to get a reservation just hours before arriving at 8:30 PM by calling the restaurant (OpenTable showed no availability). It was impressively packed for a Monday night; I didn't see a single empty table in sight.The menu is quite simple, with a selection of charcuterie, cheese, small plates and a few plats du jour. We opted to order a charcuterie platter, a burrata dish, and some grilled squid with a spicy romesco sauce. They also gave us a lot of bread to eat with our charcuterie platter, which had very generous servings of the pork and pistachio terrine, duck rillettes, and some salami (there is no description on the menu, but this is probably not for those who prefer straightforward prosciutto and salami!). I really enjoyed the burrata and we decided the squid was our favourite dish and the most unique / interesting, but really, they were all stellar. As for the orange wine, we got an amazing lesson from our waitress about its flavour profile and how it is made. There is also an interesting little blurb in the wine list. The wine list is an exhaustive list, with many types of red and white wines from all over the world, but the waitress said the place was known for their selection of orange wine, as they have an entire page dedicated to it, whereas most places would be lucky to even have a bottle. We went for a 2006 Venezia Guilia Pinot Grigio, as it was one of the few made from a familiar grape, and found it really enjoyable. The only thing I wish they would change was to not give us a red table and better lighting so I could actually appreciate the fact that it was orange!",

Unfortunately the manager told us when we arrived the wait would be around 20 minutes long. At 55 minutes, we checked in were rudely addressed by the manager that it wasn't their problem they underestimated.I understand if you're off by 15-20 minutes, not if you're a popular restaurant and off by 35 and decide to add on attitude \"because you can.\" Having already bought a bottle of wine, would have expected some level of service beyond walking away from the client. For this level of arrogance, would expect this to be a far better restaurant than quite a few of the reviews have indicated.One additional star for the wine we bought while waiting. Honestly though, save your time and money and go elsewhere.",

The one little drawback would be that our first bottle of wine - a smoky white retailing at around \u00a370 - was quite corky but the staff claimed that it was the taste of the vino and wouldn't change it, despite our protests. It was definitely corky, as we're fans of that wine and know it quite well. Also, by 11 pm they had finished ALL the desserts save for the rice pudding, which was just ok. Would I go back? Perhaps, but there are far greater places in London, in my opinion.",

The manager was un-apologetic to the point of argumentative when we suggested the menu was misleading. The atmosphere is loud with thumping music not conducive to enjoy wine or food. The wine list was exhaustive however the wait staff was too busy to answer any questions.The couple making out at the bar provided a bit of comic relief.I would avoid this place.",

I walked in drenched, cold and looking very vague, haha, and the bar staff could tell. But they welcomed me with open arms and assisted in sorting out a table for when my friends arrived. Everyone is super friendly here, and very attentive. It didn't take long for me to have a bottle of red on the table and ready to drink. They have a huge range of wines, and it can feel a little overwhelming trying to find the right one. But have no fear any of the staff will help you out. The venue has a great homey feel to it, and it would be perfect for a date night. I did notice a few dates happening, and I felt slightly under dressed.Even though we overstayed our initial one wine, the staff didn't pressure us to leave. Once the table needed to be turned around for dinner service, they gave us 20mins warning, which was plenty of time to down a glass each. Would definitley head back here again.",

    "text": "I've been here twice, and it was excellent both times. This time, we came in for \"a quick glass of wine,\" and were having such a nice time that we cancelled our dinner plans at a different restaurant and stayed to feast on charcuterie and langoustines, paired with some cool, funky wines. As others have noted, they focus on natural wines from small producers, with an emphasis on France and Italy, but some wines from other places. We sat at the bar both times, and found the servers to be highly knowledgable and extremely friendly. They let us taste before committing to a glass and clearly were passionate about their work. We started off with a glass of their special amphora negroamaro from Puglia, which was everything a natural wine should be - funky, complex, something you would imagine sipping while sitting in a medieval monastery full of beeswax candles laboriously copying ancient texts. It paired beautifully with the charcuterie selection - a delicious pork terrine with pistachios, some salami and duck rillettes. Also had a glass of their Vino di Anna from Sicily, which paired particularly nicely with an Emmentaler cheese. We went in an unusual order and had seafood and white wine second - some langoustines paired with a chardonnay from Jura. After dinner, we had a few glasses of some of their other wines - an orange wine from Emilia-Romagna and some of their special reds. What I love is that they have so many rotating specials, so you never know what you could discover. This is a place to come with a small group of friends or a date to taste and enjoy some unique wines in a lively but relaxed setting - it's kind of the opposite of Gordons (which does have unique wines, but it's more a place to DRINK wine rather than TASTE wine). For sure worth a visit for any oenophile.",
