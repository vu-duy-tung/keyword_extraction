Eventually, I was persuaded to drop by one afternoon, and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the raw fish, and even more taken aback by the price. This is probably the cheapest sashimi place you can find in Central London 3 pieces of fresh salmon for \u00a31.50. I dare you to find me another place offering such good value, at quality freshness too! I've yet to try the sushi, altho I'm keen to check out the rainbow roll, california maki and spicy tuna. But I was so swept away with excitement during my last visit that I ordered 6 portion of salmon sashimi and just had that for my entire meal. Aaaah! Satisfaction. :)",

Yes I am able to comment as I've been up at 4am to queue outside Daiwa Sushi (at 5am), Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo for the freshest and best sushi in the world.Anyway, back to Atari-ya, just for some info, they're actually a fish monger to a lot of high class restaurants in London such as Nobu, so you know the fish is going to be of a certain standard...The great thing is at Atari-ya, you don't have to spend a load to get the best, it is incredibly cheap, even cheaper than the sushi counter at Japan Centre. All the sashimi they have is superb, however, my only recommendation (aside from recommending the whole menu!) is that you upgrade from \"Medium Fatty Tuna\" to their \"Fattiest Tuna\", both is good... but the fattiest is worth that little extra. Despite the lack of seating, and the general small size of the restaurant, it does have a stand up bar in case you're out of luck with grabbing one of the two tables. All this brings back fond memories of being seated inside a cramped sushi bar on a cold damp morning in Tokyo... so for that it gets the full five stars.",

My friend had the salmon donburi (\u00a38.50) it looked a lot nicer than mine - thinly sliced salmon with black and white sesame seeds sprinkled on top, coupled with some Japanese pickles and salmon roe.

You will be so surprised how inexpensive the sushi is as well-it's amazing value for money. They also sell various soft Japanese drinks and sweets. The only downside to this little sushi bar is how small it is. There are only two tables and four chairs in this small cafe which is fine if it's quiet and you don't have to wait for a seat otherwise you'll have to stand and wait or grab your sushi as a take away. However, don't let this deter you as it's the best sushi i have yet to find in London and the staff are so sweet and helpful. I love it!",

And seriously--old-tasting, raw fish is the thing of my worst, stomach-heaving night terrors. The staff turnover is also troubling. Gone are all the sweet Japanese girls giggling at my husband's Japanese and calling out orders in their shrill, girly accents. Replaced by non-Japanese speaking Europeans, who don't know the difference between chutoro and otoro. So much for my top-quality, cheap sushi fixes in Marylebone. At least the ramen scene is booming.",

As noted by other reviewers this is primarily a takeaway location with basically no ambiance or seating. However, who cares about all that extraneous superficial stuff when Atari-Ya offers such wonderful high-quality sushi? Word of warning though - they tend to sell out of some of the fish as it gets later in the day (a positive in my book as the limited quantity is a sign of freshness and quality). Don't be crushed if they are out of your favorite, try something new and different because you can't go wrong here!",

The staff is all Japanese and though the service can be a bit haphazard at times, the quality of the sushi is top-notch. Highly recommended.Note for lunch the wait for the sushi chefs to make your rolls can be lengthy---try 30-40 minutes if you get there much after 1230pm, so you're much better off getting there by noon or even better yet---phone in your order. There isn't much in terms of seating so plan on taking your sushi to go. Location in Marylebone is handy, just off Oxford Street.",

    "text": "Best sushi I've had in the UK so far, but I feel there is even better out there.We ordered quite a bit in two different rounds. First round we went with 2 rolls: spicy tuna, & salmon avocado, and 5 different sashimi (3pieces each): salmon, yellow tail, fattiest tuna, uni, eel.Both of the rolls were very tasty. To date the best tasting spicy tuna I've ever had, and also the smallest spicy tuna I've ever had. It cannot be all great I suppose. The salmon avocado was also very good.The sashimi was interesting. It was my first time having Uni and I've decided it is not for me. I prefer my seafood to have at least some consistency. I can understand why people like it though, I suggest giving it a try, but not if you don't want to pay the almost 10GBP price tag (most expensive sashimi on the menu). The yellow tail was top notch. The salmon was 2nd best I've ever had (Fat Salmon in Philly still holds that title). The eel was eel, love it, yet I can never understand why nobody ever serves it without eel sauce. The fatty tuna was awesome. It looked like a raw cut of pork with all the lovely streaks but boy was it good. I could eat that all day long and die happily.Round 2 we went for regular tuna sashimi and salmon sashimi, more spicy tuna and a Chirashi bowl. The Chirashi bowl was good, I was especially impressed with the rice, sticky, delicious and worked perfectly with the assortment provided (shredded crab, crab stick, 2 types of roe, egg, pickled something, 3 salmon sashimi, shrimp).The experience definitely makes me want to visit their other locations and their retail locations.I think that Atari-Ya would be 5 stars if they had slightly larger portions, especially as the pricing isn't overly extortionate, and the quality is definitely worth a try..",

This place is worth a stop if you want something quick to go but do not come her expecting fine dinning. The company sells fish as a wholesale unit to sushi chains throughout London so their fish is fresh and affordable as sushi grade fish goes.

I wanted something slightly more authentic -- and slightly more edible.Yet again, Yelp came to my rescue. Atari-Ya is very small, but I called in an order for takeaway and it was ready by the time I got there (about 15 minutes). I had the Spicy Yellowtail Ura Maki (inside-out roll) and a Salmon Avocado maki, and found both to be reasonably portioned and priced. They were also delicious and both came with the option of either being garnished with sesame seeds or tobiko.Now my office smells slightly of soy sauce, but it was totally worth it.

    "text": "Super fresh fish, and I'm sure some of the better sushi at reasonable prices in London. Don't let looks deceive you - what looks like a slightly run-down hole in the wall place actually has huge slabs of fish that look (and taste) really fresh. The prices are a little bit pricey for lunch (I think they just raised their prices), but for the quality, it's worth paying a little more.You can order sashimi or nigiri a la carte and they have a pretty wide selection of fish (maybe 12-15 choices), you can get a chirashi bowl, or sushi rolls. The nigiri usually runs about \u00a32-3 per piece, and the sashimi is about \u00a33-4 for 2 pieces, so it's not necessarily a cheap meal if you end up getting 6-8 pieces of nigiri or sashimi. I ended up getting a salmon and avocado sushi roll and the pieces that were cut from the roll were pretty generous in size. The rolls were tasty, but they do have a little bit of mayo inside, which was a little strange -- the salmon inside the rolls weren't huge pieces either. Either way, it was still good and relatively filling.The 2 pieces of of tuna nigiri and the yellowtail nigiri were great, especially the yellowtail because it seemed really fresh. I'd definitely come back here again and get a sashimi platter or the deluxe chirashi bowl; the smaller chirashi bowl mainly had crab and shrimp which didn't seem like it would be as fresh as the fish. I saw them cutting huge slabs of fish that looked really fresh, so I'd stick to that.You can dine in or get your food to take away - the inside isn't super renovated with the linoleum floors and metal tables, and the plastic trays for sushi that make it look like it came from the supermarket. However, just ignore all of that and go for the fish. I probably wouldn't come here on a business lunch if you were trying to wine and dine a client, but it's a great place for a casual lunch or to get something to go. Expect to spend about \u00a312-20 for lunch. I'll definitely be back - it's in a convenient location right off of Bond Station.",

    "text": "The sushi here is undoubtedly very good. It is a no-frills restaurant reminiscent of a fishmongers, and can get very crowded at lunchtimes with little room to move past people waiting to order without hitting the people inside eating. I would recommend ordering in advance as they always say it will be 30 minutes to wait usually they are a lot quicker than the stated time, however they do have a lot of new staff currently and they have recently messed up our orders meaning that we had to wait an extra 15 minutes whilst they made the platter for us. I like that on quiet days you can watch the chefs prepare your food and that every time I go into Atari-Ya I can never work out if I feel that I am more in a fresh-smelling chippy or a fishmongers that serves food.",

    "text": "I was originall going to a nearby sushi place that was closed and by chance lucked out by stumbling across Atari-ya. I got the Super xl chirachi, which at first seemed a bit pricey \u00a0for a place like this -- it's a hole in the wall with sparce seating consisting of \u00a0beat up picknick style tables and faint smell of harsh chemical cleaning detergent -- but as I dug into the enormous serving I realised that it was a bargain at (\u00a316) , only I should probably have settled for the smaller one. The place isn't really much to look at and I would recommend it for takeout unless you're a fan of previously mentioned barebone interior and the ambience \u00a0of a storage container. The food however is an entirely different matter. It might be lacking in presentation -- even if I did enjoy the sight of a wasabi smiley face the size of a ping pong ball -- but in terms of straight up quality of fish and preparation of it, Atari-ya makes up for all its little flaws with seemingly little effort. The melting fatty tuna alone is among the best I ever had and together with the generously distributed pieces of ebi, sea urchin, variations of roe, amazing salmon (which I'm normally not a super fan of) and more it really comes together as a great deal. This is no fuzz sushi at it's best and I'm pretty sure I'll be back a lot in the future, even if it's a little out of my way.Edit note:After recently discovering many better sushi places around town, not actually have been back to Atari-ya more than once, and still mostly remembering it for that harsh smell of cleaning detergent the first time around, I have lowered my score from a 4 to a 3. The fish is of good quality and priced reasonably, but not worth travelling across town for. If you're in the area and want a good quick bite it's definitely a good option but otherwise you could do better.",

This is the same chain...but for sushi rather than groceries. I approooove! I have to admit, I didn't really look at the menu...I just listed my seven favorite nigiri sushi and sat down with a nice warming cup of miso soup. However my friend ordered some of the maki sushi...and they were goooorgeous. Seriously, the unagi roll is the nicest maki-zushi I have had in London.You should all definitely try:- Hottate (amazing, melt in the mouth scollops) - Amaebi (the small, slimy sweet shrimps - delish!)Not bad:- Hamachi (I can't remember what this is in English - maybe yellow tail?)- Unagi (I am a bit of an unagi snob. I like it served warm with a dribble of the sweet soy sauce. But this wasn't really up to scratch here.) @JB...you would love this place! It will fill up your sushi baby happily.",

    "text": "#525 Definitely a 4.5-star establishment for quality, affordability, and friendliness. It's a shame there aren't more affordable sushi joints in London, but that just means Atari-Ya has become my go-to location for raw fish fixings in England. Oh, and the place isn't as small as the other reviewers made me to believe! There are 3-4 regular-sized tables outside, with five 2-seater tables inside. That's a decent amount of seating! It does get a bit cramped when the line gets longer than 5 people, but that's to be expected with the place's narrow layout. Anyways, early afternoon Thursday found us at Atari-Ya to finally satiate our sushi cravings and the boyfriend and I were greeted with several empty tables AND just 2 people in front of us in line! We went crazy - fatty tuna, yellowtail, salmon, uni, and eel with a spicy tuna roll and a salmon avocado roll! Total? 29.50gbp. Not bad at all, yo. The young lady who helped us was cheerful, patient, and soft-spoken. She handed us a ticket for our order and we settled down in a table next to the sushi bar. It took a little while before everything made it out, but the quality more than made up for the wait. Everything was deliciously fresh and tasted just as it should! The uni was a new experience and I think, over time, I can acquire a taste for it. I just don't have anything to compare it to yet in terms of quality. So, I can't say too much about it. The fatty tuna, though, was the fattiest I've had to date and it did not let me down! The fat melted on my tongue and coated all of my taste buds with a buttery soup - I was in love. The yellowtail wasn't the best, but the salmon was definitely up there. Eel ... well, let's just say I only ordered it because Adam B. loves it. Ha. Done with Round 1, we spent about 2 minutes mulling it over before deciding to man up and dive straight into Round 2. So, we went for regular tuna, salmon, another spicy tuna roll, AND a chirashi bowl. Were we nuts? Yes, yes we were. Round 2 took way longer to come out because the late-lunch crowd came roaring in right before I got in line again. But, again, the quality made me forgive and forget right when I bit into the spicy tuna roll. Am I coming back? You bet your Yelp-loving butt I am.",

The wait was really long, but the chefs were having fun and the staff were all-around smiling and this made me not care to much about the time. But then I got my food...Something not good was up with my sushi (I had a CA roll, salmon roll, & spicy tuna roll). My California rolls were like nothing I've ever seen or had before - and that's not a good thing. They were just odd-tasting. The shade of the tuna seemed a bit browner than it should have been, but I initially put this down to the spicy seasoning of my spicy tuna roll. I was, however, wrong. \u00a0I ate a couple, and didn't feel very good about it. In the end, my body told me that the tuna was not for eating and I couldn't finish the rest as it just tasted off. Apart from the fish being a bit dodgy-seeming, for some reason everything here seems to be slathered with mayonnaise. To me, sushi is about clean and fresh flavors. This experience was more like eating a heavy mayo salad sandwich filling in rice. Not pleasing and not pleasant. 1 star for the food (the salmon roll wasn't exciting, but it wasn't bad), and 1 star for the very good service. Unfortunately, I don't think I'd give Atari-ya another chance.",
