Pear juice - Delish!Lassi - Divine!Lamb soup - My friend said it was the best!Aloo gobi - To die for!Cheese naanand Garlic naan - Mouthwatering...Remembering exactly what you ordered six weeks after eating it? \u00a0- Priceless!Visit Simply Indian for a simply enjoyable meal",

    "text": "I think Simply Indian's name is a little bit misleading -- there's nothing simple about their food at all, and that's the fun in it.This restaurant is tucked away near the Borough Tube Station, but boasts a nice selection of dishes that offer something more than the run-of-the-mill Chicken korma/tikka masala that most Indian restaurants in this country tend to rely on. Those dishes are available, of course, but for the same money, there's much better and unique dishes to try.When I was there, my boyfriend tried the Masala Dosa -- a large crispy pancake served with four different types of fillings that was different to anything I've ever had. I had the Tandoori Fish Tikka, which included a really delicate curry and very well cooked halibut -- my only complaint was that there wasn't more of it. Another person in our dinner party had the lamb shank, which was both tender and juicy. Everyone came out of their Simply Indian experience with happy stomachs and much of our conversation revolved around what we would order when (and not if) we came back for another round.Also, something I appreciated was the size and quantity of the mango lassi I ordered. Most restaurants that I've been to tend to skimp out and give wimpy portions of mango lassi that go away too quickly. Simply Indian's was not only tasty, but plentiful.And for a final comment, I'd also like to note that Simply Indian is very affordable, so try it out!",

We ordered the Hyderabadi Kali Mirch and Sindhi Murgh for entree it was pretty good i must say. Hyderabadi kali mirch was a bit on the spicy side but full of flavour, sindhi murgh was creamy and delicious. To finish off our spicy dinner we had Tropical tutti frutti cocktail icecream for dessert which ended up as a pleasant palette cleanser. Service was good. So overall i would indeed recommend this place. Totally worth a try.",

I had the wrap for a starter and though not very Indian, it was fresh, big and tasty. For mains curries were ordered along with the mixed grill and the dosa, which was fab. We didn't order sweets, but the food was excellent value and the BYO great. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone local and we'll deffo be back.",

Pro, the food was lovely, not one of those places that supplies meat lumps in gloopy sauces of varying shades of luminous orange. The dishes were fragrant and you could taste the different spices, not overwhelmingly hot either. Con, the dish sizes were quite small, we ordered quite generously for three people and polished it off far too easily. Pro, you won't feel like a big fat jabba after you've stuffed yourself rotten on giant portions. Con, isn't that what ordering an Indian take away is all about?!??",

It had been preciously arranged for a \u00a320 a head buffet and it was fine if I ordered from a la carte since only a couple of buffet dishes were vegan out of 10 or so.We had obligatory poppadoms and the chutneys were pretty good actually (it better be as it ended up each one was pushing \u00a32!).The staff knew I was dairy-free gave me extra mango chutney in lieu of raita (yay!), but still brought out creamy sides dishes as extras for me, and I'm pretty sure the dosa still had ghee in it (boo!). The food was ok. Nothing special. Nothing terrible though. A mere \"it was good\" happily wafted about the table.The bill came. It was \u00a322pp (instead of \u00a320). Well, this mistake was remedied by NOT going to the agreed price and ADDING an additional person onto the bill. Who, all of a sudden, they had prepared extra buffet food for and would not back down. Did I mention the 6 poppadoms they brought to share between 11 people was \u00a310?!So, as other reviews have mentioned, DON'T go with groups. The only reason I didn't give it one star because the food itself wasn't terrible. Everything else was: service, price, toilets through kitchen, and getting some weird bites on my fingers while I was there (dirty napkins?).",

    "text": "Tucked away on Tabard St., Simply Indian has limited seating (including a few small tables outside) but quite an extensive menu. Along with typical Indian appetizers like samosas and papadums (served with 4 dips & a small chickpea mango salad), there is a wide selection of both vegetarian and meat curries, with various degrees of heat. If you're a fan of naan bread, I highly recommend trying out the less traditional variations. They also make a mean mango lassi here. My only criticism is that service can be rather slow, even when it's not busy so be patient. The food comes out quickly but the waiters tend to disappear out back. Like most indian restaurants in the UK, Simply Indian is BYOB though I'm not sure if there's a corking fee.",

I went for the Goan chicken curry which was absolutelty delicious. \u00a0A nice spicy kick to it too. We also tried their shank of lamb which was so tender it came off the bone just like that. To top it off the marinade and sauce was divine.  We thought the prices were reasonable too. This place is definitely a gem! Huge plus that they opened late.

He said he would call me back. I missed his call and called him back right away, and all he said was that the order was on its way and that he couldn't tell me how long it would take. When I complained about this, especially the part when no one had even apologised to me for the food being ONE HOUR late at this point, he started screaming at me, said I didn't let him check on the food's arrival time because I called too soon (despite me being the one to return his call), and then hung up on me.When I spoke to the manager, he behaved in a similar way, refusing to apologise for the lateness OR the rude member of staff, and when I tried to finish my sentence he said I wouldn't let him speak, WHILE HE WAS INTERRUPTING ME. Mind numbing. He also lied and said the staff member was yelling because he was on the road, then I clarified it wasn't the driver, and then he lied again and denied he had yelled at all! This is also the second time this has happened to me, there is a member of staff there that if your food is extremely late, will start calling you an \"impossible woman\" (what he did last time) if you dare to politely ask for \u00a0an apology. Sexist on top of rude, because God forbid a woman has a problem with him and wants to be heard. That was a couple years ago and back then I was assured he was let go. Apparently not only wasn't he, but the management backs this behaviour.DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS.",

    "text": "My friends and I stopped by Simply Indian on vacation after hearing great things about the Indian food on offer in London. We were seated quickly upon entering the establishment, but the table next to us was filled with drunk, extremely loud patrons, at least ten or twelve. Their table was filled with empty bottles of booze and they were yelling, singing, and blasting music out of a shitty Bluetooth speaker placed on the table. By far the worst restaurant patrons I've ever seen anywhere. It's not SI's fault at all, but I really need to vent after such a shocking display of contempt for others. Luckily they left afer about fifteen minutes, but it was a painful time while it lasted.Anyway. We quickly got our papadum after sitting down and it, and especially the sauces with which it was served, were amazing. The salsa (whose name I do not know) was phenomenal, and the chutney was better than any other I've ever had. But once receiving it, we were left hanging for a good ten or fifteen minutes before our orders were taken. We were considering leaving, but our food came out only five minutes later, and it was well worth the wait. I got chicken biryani, probably my favorite Indian dish, and it beat even the delicious biryani found in my local Indian place back home.A friend got the Southern Thali and I think he won the night. The assortment of food that came with it was broad, and all of it was yummy. A little spicier than I was prepared for, but it was overall well-balanced and left me wanting a portion of my own.The table also got some jhalfrezi. I'd never heard of the dish before, but the description sounded appetizing so we took a chance and, lo and behold, it was wonderful. Again, spicier than I was expecting, but it was something fundamentally different than Indian food I was familiar with. I've never noticed it on any menu before, but I'll be sure to look for it when I get back home!We were surprised with a dessert menu and, at a friend's strong suggestion, got the carrot fudge with mango ice cream. Fantastic decision. At risk of sounding repetitive, it was something totally new to me and borderline indescribable. It tasted carrot-like, but smoother and sweeter. I'll echo that recommendation. Just get it. Our waiter actually brought one out without even taking our order, he was that sure we'd like it!Afterwards, he came out again and had a chat about the chef's background and the philosophy of the food he had prepared for us.Overall, despite the rocky start to the night, the food and service were phenomenal. It's sort of hidden in a back corner, but if you find yourself in the neighborhood, Simple Indian is absolutely worth a visit.",

This food was \"simply Indian.\" It was Indian made just RIGHT, with fresh, elegant ingredients and rich spices. The spice was just what I expect from South Indian food, decadently spicy!",

Either way, there was a large group of soccer players about 19-24 being overly loud, chaotic, unruly and loud again while drinking in the corner of the restaurant. I'm amazed the table top that was on date night didn't leave sooner. Either way the dishes and prices were more than enough for me to note:1) It's worth returning 2) The new menu's are needed3) liquor is BYOB4) The Mix grill was done quite nicely5) I tried new things and although I won't order the top left chicken dish again - there was nothing wrong with it but more heat than needed. I'm from Louisiana which includes New Orleans and all the creole/cajun and deep south spiciness any one can handle YET... I don't like spice for the sake of heat. This could have been just as good a few notches down on the scale of measuring heat/spice. 6) the samosa dip was nice. Sweet and Spicy - just right. 7) The onions on the mix grill were excellent. 8) Yelp 10% off check in offer hit the right spot 9) Location is nice as it's close enough to the Tower10) The place is small as in tight on space but clean. The restroom was spotless11) No ice12) Naan even with lamb was great13) You must order an entree if you're ordering. 14) Krysten P wrote her review as directed in exchange for the 10% off. IT's hiliarious as one friend stated...that's not how this is supposed to work. I didn't mind as I liked the place 15) Late hours16) The buffet used to exist, lunch buffet once existed, lower prices were an old time staple and currently - you can get all but a few dishes for $10.17) Pizza place next door is quite nice. And a good price for take away.",

I love the style of papadum they serve here--very light and crunchy with great accompaniments (the chutney is light and fresh with bright lemon tang).Only downside is now I have to go back home and try to find a restaurant like this one!
