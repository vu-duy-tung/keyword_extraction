Have to say I did not drink in the famed awesomeness of this place, it's just a pub really innit? Yeah the clientele are East London poseurs but if you try to ignore them, it's alright.",

The pub downstairs in cosy and warm and the restaurant upstairs is unpretentious and has character. The quality of the food is fantastic and portions are generous. Prices range from around \u00a310 - \u00a315 for main courses. I've not been there when the Columbia Road flower market is open bit I've been told it is fantastic. The Royal Oak website shows that there is a cafe which would serve as the perfect respite. If you're in the area it is certainly worth visiting.",

Delicious warm eggplant salad (it's still July 4th weekend, none of that silly 'aubergine' stuff, dammit) with pomegranate seeds and flatbread. Beautifully presented and delicious. I also had a tuna steak with capers that was very very good, although not done thick-sliced with a rare center (not centre...see what I'm doing there? HA) but surprisingly thin. Decor: Love it. Amazing large-scale screenprints from this gallery I love across the street of old English poems I remember from childhood and cuts of beef. I would like to purchase both of these or, ideally, receive them as presents. HINT HINT. Service: Lovely. General Atmosphere: LovelyPitcher of Pimm's: Best I've ever had. Homemade lemonade, crisp and cold cucumber, lots of fruits, and a personal apology from the bartender that they were out of fresh mint. The upstairs doesn't have the attitude which I've noticed a bit from the bartenders downstairs, and overall the place is just wonderful.",

We had reserved a table upstairs for a roast and were sat by the window upstairs. The food was decent, although the roast beef was severely undercooked in parts, which is surprising since it's a roast and probably was cooking for hours... The sides were all good though. The bloody mary had a nice flavor, but not as amazing as the other reviewers say- most notably because there was barely any ice in it. No olives or celery either- two items I consider staples in a good bloody mary. (Yes, I am a bloody mary connoisseur!) I'd return on a Sunday, after or before a stop at the flower market, but wouldn't make a trip there any other day, most likely.",

This pub is so cozy with wooden floors and tables, a bit dark and usually pretty packed. They also have a good selection of board games so the staff really don't mind if you really spend the entire afternoon there, and also ask all your friends around.The food is way above average pub food - it is freshly made traditional but modern, good British food. I often go with the fish or vegetarian options, and it has always been a real treat. \u00a0The food is not cheap but well money worth. During the summers there is separate cafe in the back garden where you can get the best coffee in that neighborhood, and really really cute baristas..",

There's an ornate 1923 Truman livery sign, shouting 'in between the wars' architecture that compliments its Victorian neighbours. There's your usual exposed floorboards, antique furniture (popular with yummy mummies and local 'yoof') with a bizarre, packed to the rafters outside space where smokers huddle. It would be criminal if you didn't come here and order the roast, in four years I have ordered nothing else (experimenting with side orders at a push!) Although comprising of a pub, upstairs dining room or cafe menu, with a new selection of New World wines you're really rather spoiled for choice. Sunday lunch is served (if you can pinch a table) between noon and four. I always opt for roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, cabbage sauteed with bacon, carrots and gravy for \u00a314 which is worth that price tag for the American diner style portions, alongside hand cut chips if you're feeling good and a house salad if you're feeling not quite so bad! There's also decently kept beer Adnam's and Timothy Taylor on tap, with a drunken game of chess always available to chill out your Sunday and leave you feeling suitably stuffed. Also quite the place to impress a future amour and reel off a local history lesson!",

The decor is unobtrusive but lovely and cosy, lots of wood and the lightings nice and soft for those Sunday hangovers, they've kept all the nice bits of a traditional country pub and jettisoned all the rubbish. The food is seriously tasty - if you get there early enough to get a table. It gets so busy at the weekend.

They gave the impression they did not want to be there and they did not want you there either. However there seems to have been a change of attitude and a tinkering of the staff personnel. While you could not say they were fresh breezes of happiness, the current bunch are polite and reasonably efficient. You'd never go there for bar-staff bonhomie but at least its not a reason to avoid any more. All the other good things remain; the food, the interior (wood and big windows), and nice horse-shoe bar and of course. The upstairs restaurant is well worth checking out. The food is great (similar but somehow seems better than the stuff served downstairs) and has always had very good staff. But the punters seem to have changed to rent-a-middle class types and while chatty are not really ready to mix. They keep to themselves in their own groups. Is it because they have travelled to the 'dangerous east end' from Notting Hill Gate and are too scared to look at anyone? Who knows and frankly, who cares. The remaining gripes are the price of wines (good selection mind), it can get very very busy at weekends and the standard of the lager beers.",

Wait 'til you see the pics -- like a spread from Saveur.We were really hungry when we arrived. Getting through the crowded Flower Market was a workout in itself! We headed upstairs to a welcoming, daylight-bright dining room. My guy and I started with the asparagus risotto which turned out to be one of the BEST risottos I've ever had. No freaking joke. The al dente bite of the arborio rice, the creaminess, cheesiness, seasoning, and still-firm asparagus... I'm telling you. This is one of the best. (Our friends had the fried calamari which they enjoyed.)They each ordered one pork and one beef roast, while we ordered the chicken roast (serves 2 - 3.) And I don't want to brag or anything, but I think we hit on the winner winner chic....Our server was super sweet. When we found out that only the beef roast dinner comes with Yorkshire pudding (I'm pretty sure we all gasped at that) she said that she would bring some puddings on the side for us. (Which were fabulous. I forgot to get a pic of them.)Let's get down to brass tacks now. The tender moist chicken roast was crowned by gently roasted carrots, flawless savory chard, fried potatoes - with a side of thin brown gravy. There were also three meatballs (?) that were eagerly eaten up by the table. Wow, I can STILL taste it. Drinks, plus risotto, calamaris, and the roast dinners came to about \u00a3160, which I thought was a great deal. One request, Royal Oak: Could you pretty please update your contact information so people can confirm reservations?",

Ringing in at \u00a319, you get a slice of roast, with yorkshire pudding, cooked greens, carrot mash (with wholegrain mustard), and deep fried potatoes slathered with some really really delicious gravy. \u00a0I thought it was a bit pricey for roast (considering you can get it for much cheaper at other places around the city), but I think this is probably the better roast meal I've had in London in comparison to the \u00a313 dishes I've had. I loved the greens, would happily ask for more to mop up the gravy (though there wasn't much left). \u00a0I wasn't too keen on the carrot mash, so I think I'd ask for all the sides to be swapped out for the greens. yum! We also ordered a bowl of triple cooked chips for \u00a33.50 - thick sizeable crispy chunks with garlic aioli. \u00a0Some of the best fries I've had, very crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. \u00a0Would come back again!",

Ok, this is not a negative thing, but the 'old man drinking den' vibe down stairs was much more appealing!Upstairs in all fairness, was quite nice. Service was laid back to the point of possibly being poor, but was friendly enough all the same. I opted for a beer to start with and that was pretty nice, coming from a wee local craft brewer (I think). Starter was a stunning chorizo baw thang in a lovely sweet sauce. Perfect and just right with a nice IPA. At this point I'm thinking 4 star easy (despite the lax service... hey, we all have bad days!), but then my main came and i instantly deducted a star. I opted for the lamb stew and was so underwhelmed by the flavour that I reached for the salt and pepper within one bite. To say that it was rubbish would be entirely unfair, as it was OK. But given the price and the quality of the starter, it just felt very weak in comparison. A nice place. I'd like to have spent a little more time in the main bar, but it was not to be.",

I hope he doesn't read Yelp.The Royal Oak is a gem of a pub. It's wonderfully cosy, with a great central bar in the middle. I had walked past it loads but never actually been in for a drink until this evening and now it's becoming a bit of a regular hang out. They have The Stool Pigeon to flick through, a nice selection of wines and mulled wine to warm you up in winter. I also like the fact it's always busy, and you feel like you're arriving at a friends house. Very welcoming indeed.I can't wait to go back and try their dining rooms. The food sounds delish!",

    "text": "Columbia Road Flower Market on a sunny Sunday afternoon is terrifying. I didn't even try to get past the very fringes it was so rammed with hot & bothered yuppies. Luckily, the Royal Oak is at one end and had refreshing jugs of Bloody Mary at the ready. We ate upstairs in the dining room which has the air of a rustic period parlour, cosy and nice for a small group. My crab starter was underwhelming but the board of meat, pate and scotch egg I had afterwards was better. This was blown away by my friend's roast though which was really good - the lamb was fantastic - tender, juicy and full of flavour. All accompanying bits were good as well. Desserts were quite good - I liked the flavour combination of sweet banana and meringue with lime and hazelnut brittle, but my friends chocolate ganache looked like a really weird raw sausage which was a bit off putting although she at it all so it must have been good. So my tip for here would be - focus on the roast which is well above average for a pub Sunday lunch (which it should be at nearly \u00a320). And you may need to be proactive with your server, they are pretty relaxed.",

After a romp through the flower market, The Royal Oak's bloody mary, Sunday roast and ice cold pint of cider all enjoyed in the sunny back garden truly set me straight for the upcoming week.The roast was delectable - two juicy slices of roast beef, plenty of steamed kale, sweet roasted carrot, crispy potatoes and a not-too-hard, not-too-soft yorkshire pud. I wasn't able to indulge in dessert, but I also nibbled on a Neal's Yard cheese board, and drooled over charcuterie plates being passed around the next table. I will say that RO was an unapologetic twat-epicentre, however I certainly wasn't complaining about the short-short cut offs that my darling bartender was pairing with his neon Miami tee. I was the visitor, not them... and I can appreciate that. This will forever be added to my ever growing list of lazy London Sunday musts.",

    "text": "As part of my trip to London, the friends I met up with were All About The Pubs. They had received a list from their hosts of the necessary places to visit, those obscure, off-the-beaten-path pubs and restaurants that the locals know and frequent. The Royal Oak is, from my experience, one of these places, and as it was the first pub I tried in the London area, a great one to start out at. Tiny and cozy, The Royal Oak gives the best experience: a wrap-around bar, a large selection of drinks, including many ciders 'on tap', rickety chairs, benches and stools, old wood tables, interesting English decorations, and windows through which to enjoy the various London weather happening outside while you're tucked warm inside.Unfortunately, my time at The Royal Oak was cut short by a date with the Eye, but given it's out-of-the-way location, I'd have no qualms about wandering back for a few more pints, a snack or bag of crisps, and a good evening of calm frivolity. Definitely a top spot on my recommendations list.",

    "text": "We started with lunch upstairs, which was delicious. It was a Sunday so we all opted for the roast beef which came with a good amount of veg. I always find that the Brits go short on veg on Sundays so I was pleasantly surprised when I had a plate full of greens. The beef was cooked really nicely and the Yorkshire pudding was large enough to please everyone. I can also recommend the sticky toffee pudding. The crowd upstairs was a bit mixed--old, young and even really young. But overall, a very mellow and cordial group. It's also worth noting that there are prints handing in the restaurant that are for sale. I was tempted to buy one, but budgets prevented this random purchase. After a really long and enjoyable lunch, we decided that it was best to continue drinking downstairs as it was pouring down with rain outside. We definitely made the right decision. 4 or 5 bottles of wine later we were still having a super time. The pub is hull of hipsters, so if you like that sort of thing you'll fit right in. Or if you're not a big hipster, at least there's some good people watching. It was packed when we arrived, but after just a few short minutes we were able to get a table and stay for the rest of the day. The seats are haphazardly placed around the edge of the pub, suggesting that no thought or effort was put into the design. However I think it's quite the contrary... I think everything has been strategically haphazardly placed! I would definitely go back.",
