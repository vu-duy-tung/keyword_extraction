The service throughout was very efficient and the ambience was good. Think a cut above a chic bistro. It's supposedly a gastro pub but it really does take pride in what it does. We had a three courses for \u00a321 offer which was really good value. The main Sea Bream with curried cauliflower was amazing. Worth going back for in itself. Outside of the offer, prices are quite expensive but still very much worth a visit for a lovely treat. Note you may have to order sides with some of the mains.",

And trying to get the bill after sitting at the table with nothing in front of us for 30 minutes was really trying our patience. That said, the food was delicious especially the halibut",

We then had to wait for 25 minutes at the end of the meal for the bill! Teh then has the cheek to add 12.5% service. They were happy to removed this in the end, but we had to make a fuss.

The problem with this place is not the food (we sat opposite the open kitchen and the chefs looked very on the ball), the problem is the staff. Generally the service is good, but on a few occasions we waited half an hour for a cheeseboard and about twenty five minutes for the bill. I thought Gordon Ramsay Holdings prided itself on staff quality - not sure at the Y&A - and there's plenty of them (sometimes way more staff than customers on a quiet lunch time). Go once for the experience, not sure if you'll go back. The bar is good and the cocktails are the best in the area! Our waiter told us how expensive he thought our drinks were, not sure that's the best sales technique! All in all, a place with great potential that hasn't been fully realised yet.",

But that is average a word that is not in Gordon Ramsay's vocabulary.Enter the York and Albany a Tardis like jewel that from the outside would never reveal the treasures within. Inside beautifully original features find you walking through an elegant bar into a cosy eating area which even on a Tuesday sees every table full. A great menu that delivers simplicity and diversity using the finest of ingredients starters like Black pudding with a poached egg that had even lifelong black pudding haters amazed at the extraordinary taste to magnificent Salmon Fish Cakes with a lemon mayonnaise. Onto Main Course and choices from the gamely Creedy Carver duck to the freshest tasting Sea Bream or winner of several london best burger awards at Breadstreet Gordon's infamous Rib Burger. Deserts I can never resist Apple and Rhubarb Crumble but the others with me had the warm Treacle tart and the Salt Caramel Parfait and all were nothing short of to die for.Service was impeccable at all times for a gastropub you could easily forget and believe you are in a Michelin 1 star restaurant with every dish created with passion and delivered to the table with love and unbridled attention. Pricewise amazing value for money if you are expecting witherspoon prices forget it but then this is as far apart from witherspoons as the Harvester is to Hawksmoor! But with 3 courses running at about \u00a325-\u00a330pp and the daily offers menu offering 2 courses \u00a318.00 or 3 courses \u00a321.00(Lunch or early dinner) you will not find this quality with such good service anywhere else in London(except of course some of Gordon's other restaurants!)Thus dinner finished the Manager Mario one of the most attentive and friendly people I have had the pleasure of meeting took us on a full guided tour this is not just a pub or a restaurant, Down stairs revealed a private party in progress with seating set in a very swanky setting leading into the Chefs table area overlooking the pristine kitchen.Back at Ground floor level and a door enters you into an old fashioned delicatessen with some of the finest and most interesting foods to buy.And then upstairs Gordon's Boutique Hotel the Townhouse with emphasis on service and traditional elegance with value, no wonder it is fully booked most nights. And also the Regency room an incredible meetings or private dining room with a massive banqueting traditional Victorian table seating upto 24 with incredible views from the original arched windows overlooking regents park the word here is wow!To sum up a complete gem that is worth a night of discovery for all Londoners and should not be missed by anyone visiting London from overseas to see how a traditional English pub is like run with excellence and every attention to detail whilst delivering traditional fare in only a way Gordon Ramsay can translate to perfection.",

Plus a free view of the goings on in the kitchen and plenty a helping of dark red allure. My (French) brother in-law was very impressed with everything, and summed it up best by saying (and I loosely quote and translate from memory): I could not fault the service, which was much better than we typically get in France. And the food was so close to fine dining, and so well executed, that for the prices they were charging it was extremely good value for the money. I agree, and would recommend the York & Albany if you want a good semi-casual place to hang out with friends or your partner for a few cocktails, wines by the glass and/or some good, simple, well prepared flavorful food.",

    "text": "hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026(for rating and pictures) Set menu: 18 pounds for 2 courses, 21 pounds for 3 courses York & Albany was a very pleasant surprise. You walk up Parkway from Camden Tube Station and it seems endless in wind and cold. You think you must have missed it, when you suddenly there it is: A Gordon Ramsey restaurant in the middle of nowhere (at least it seemed so to me, correct me when it's a really cool area after all) at the corner of Regent's Park which is unpretentious and the food is really really good. When you come in, there is a bar area (with apparently very good cocktails I was told) which invites to sit, chat and linger. I found out that there is also a boutique hotel attached to it with 10 rooms, I wouldn't mind staying there at all actually.We dined upstairs in a comfortable dining room with big windows toward a little garden (it was dark so can't tell you if it's a nice garden) and there is another dining area in the basement. The upstairs one was nicer I thought. We had booked the set menu (2 courses for 18 and 3 courses for 21 pounds) on toptable, but we clearly would not have needed to as when you arrive before 7pm you can just order it from the menu. (Cheeky toptable again, you think you have made this great deal and you clearly didn't) When I saw the menu for the evening I was a bit disappointed at first. Did not sound too exciting actually. But boy, I was so wrong, the head-chef Colin Buchan was doing an amazing job. The chicken liver and foie gras parfait did not look terribly pretty (in fact nothing looked that great, they could work on their presentation) but was delicious. Smooth and perfectly flavoured it worked heavenly together with the sweet and sour quince chutney. The little pieces of bread stuck in the chutney did look very weird though (we find the same concept of sticking things into stuff again with the dessert). After the already promising first course the second was even better. Roast Salmon on savoy cabbage with chicory jam again sounded a bit blah, but emerged as one of the most interesting fish dishes I have eaten in a long time. The salmon was almost raw with just the outside crisp, wonderfully soft and flaky. The contrast of the salty cabbage and the sweet and bitter chicory jam was highly pleasurable and I was sad when it was over. Please next time without the baby turnips though. They did not add anything to the dish, you wonder if turnips every do actually. And then the dessert! Wonderfully rich dark chocolate ganache which was so high in cacao content it was almost black. With it came caramelised bananas and honeycombs adding some luscious sweetness. It was one of these dessert where you have to hold yourself back to not lick the plate. (See photo: I put your attention to things being stuck into things again, I am not sure about this). If you go for a la carte, the starters are around 9 and the mains around 20 pounds, so not cheap. I think I would have just about been happy to pay full price for the meal as I thoroughly enjoyed it. But of course I like my bargains, and this set menu is a great one. Basically all go!",

We were led to a room at the back with a long table (or several put together) in the middle. Service was prompt. Our orders were taken as we had drinks. One friend had heard about their famous pizzas and wanted one but it was on their bar menu. No problem at all. So a few of us ordered pizzas too. The rest ordered from the ala carte. I had a starter of grilled squid and chorizo. Beautiful mix of flavours. The main of steamed halibut with smoked ham hock and celeriac broth was also delicious. The portions were just right. A few deserts were shared between us as we were too full. The bill, including drinks, was very reasonable considering there were so many of us. I will be back.",

I had parma ham with chicory and preserved pears to start, followed by a lovely roast lamb on puy lentils, and a sublime vanilla pannacotta to finish.

The bar is amazing to start with and the fact that there are a piano adds a lot more charm to the place- the restaurant on the other hand, is a disaster. I was placed on a table for two that all waiters were bumping into my handbag and dropping it to the floor (that's because the place is tiny, and packed with tables)- to add more, no one cared to say \"sorry madam\" when dropping my handbag!!! I believe I am not supposed to shove my bag between my feet or place it on my lap in such a restaurant.the food and wine were lovely the bill- which I paid myself - was a disasterI wouldn't mind the sum I paid if I had some sort of friendly service in this place. on the contrary, the French Metre was kind of snobby and arrogant- he won't lose any thing if he smiled at customers !!! might be mistaken yes I am going back certainly- if not to the restaurant, will be to the classy pub",

When we enquired we were told the barman was conducting a cocktail class \u00a0well it was more of a drinking and who could shout the loudest class from our perspective at the other end of the room!Last but not least \u00a0the music was really shoddy and crap \u00a0if a restaurant must play muzak, for goodness sake play it at a low volume and make it good \u00a0not some incessant duff duff duff music that nobody wants with their meal.I had high hopes and previously my experience eating here once before wasn't so bad \u00a0but this experience was bad enough for me to to want to leave this review. If it was my restaurant I'd be apologising and offering a free pudding for serving steak and calling it roast beef \u00a0but hey that's just me.This is after all a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and it's not like he ever shouts at anyone for getting it wrong is it!",

    "text": "Having had dinner at a place that Ramsey took apart, I thought the rational thing would be to compare against a place he owned. Before I start, I have to say, the food was fantastic; the best pork belly that I can remember eating.It's a classy little place in a not so classy area, tucked between electronics shops a little toward the end of Camden market. Great lounge and bar to grab a drink before stepping into the dining room. Marble top bar counter, very comfortable godfather type chairs, and sufficiently snooty waiters. A celebrity here or there should be unexpected. Wear a blazer. Then on, it's the dining room; ground floor for the normal, and other hidden rooms for the special. We got the fois gras, which was good but didn't stand out, and the pumpkin tortellini, on the waiter's suggestion (who looked and flapped his hands like Lloyd from entourage). That was crap. The dinner, however, redeemed all sin. My pork belly was the best I've ever tasted, and the lamb that my friends ordered was superb as well.Now where they screwed up though, our Lloyd lookalike waiter, having served our appetizers, came by at 10:40 to get our dinner order (an hour after we sat down). At which point we asked him when the kitchen was going to close, he said eleven followed by \"don't you worry about that\". Then he fucked off. At 11:30 he comes back and says that the kitchen rejected our order because it was closed. A minor kerfuffle involving the manager later, we got out meals and got the wine and desserts removed from the bill (unfortunately, they didn't consider the port wine dessert at that point). So yes, mistakes happen, but they were decent about it. We started at 9:30 and left at 1:30. Good meal in the end.",

So we ventured in... and heelllooo... we're in swanksville.Coats were taken, bags stored, polite chatter made and we were shown to our table. I was hoping we'd be upstairs with a view but alas we we were downstairs - no matter though, it's really plush and I'm a sucker for a good old open kitchen... I just love to watch them work.Came here with every intention of having the pre-fixe menu and keeping the costs to a minimum but I couldn't stop looking at the a la carte options! Ended up being a little naughty and opting for a squid starter and lamb canoon main. Both were fantastic. Sublime even. The other half had the steak tartare and then the pig cheeks from the pre-fixe and both were just as good. The pig cheeks might have even been better!Great, attentive service and a friendly atmosphere. Lunch for two with a few drinks each, service and a smile on our face when we left happy and full = \u00a370.The one star deduction is a personal thing. I'm just not hugely comfortable with gastro pubs. Either you're a restaurant or a pub... pick your side and stick to it so I know where I stand! Yeah, I'm a fussy git aren't I.",

    "text": "It was a somewhat sunny day at the weekend, I was a bit lazy and happened to look for a nice place to eat something around noon. As I walked by York & Albany many times, actually almost every time I am going to Regent's Park, I decided already some months ago, that I should check out York & Albany. And then on this lazy day, it was the right time. I did not really plan to go there, but it was one of the options I had in my head when I left to find something to eat. So, I went in and got a nice small table at the window. I liked that place a lot, because I could enjoy the sun there! I ordered a Pizza Quattro Formaggi and took the white wine the waiter recommended. The pizza was actually a bit salty, but it went very good with the white wine, so I was fine with that. The dessert tasted very very good, if not even better! When I went there, I did not know that's a Gordon Ramsay place, so I had no specific expectations or something. Anyway, I liked it and can recommend the York & Albany. Good location, tasty food, pleasant-tasting wine, and delicious desserts. What else do you need?!",

Don't be fooled by the exclusive-looking exterior of this new Camden offering from Gordon Ramsay & Angela Hartnett, because when you step inside you'll be greeted by warmth and familiarity, and not quite as steep as a price tag as you'd expect. Beyond the entrance is an inviting oval bar, high stools, gleaming stainless steel bar tops and extraordinary art deco mirrors, making this place feel very much like an up market New York hotel. The staff behind the counter are clearly trained to perfection and sitting at the bar watching their craft can entertain you for hours. And it doesn't have to cost the earth. You can order a carafe starting at \u00a311, or a cocktail for \u00a37, and with it you'll be presented some bowls of snackettes. Entering the world of the beau monde has never been so attainable!The food too, although I didn't eat there on this particular night, I have been told is exquisite, with impeccable service. With a lunch menu for just \u00a325, and A la Carte at gastro-pub prices, you just can't go wrong. The adjacent delicatessen, housed in the former stables, has a good and affordable selection of cured meats, tapas and preserves, and although it feels a little more like a museum of 'the way we were', its coffee and pastry selection are cheaper than Starbucks!",

Not so good. \u00a0I would also have liked some kind of accompanying source, like horseradish/mustard. \u00a0I should have just asked but I was slightly reluctant to cause offence/appear a complete heathen. \u00a0In contrast, the guy sitting next to us sent his roast back twice and appeared to get money off the bill. \u00a0He was especially upset about the cut of meat, although one of his other complaints seemed to have been about the way the roast was served (on a board) which didn't bother me at all. \u00a0In the end, I didn't complain at all because I didn't want to embarrass my friend, who had suggested the place.So, in conclusion, would hesitate to come here again, although I would like that tortelli again. \u00a0Paying nearly 10 quid for 5 pieces is kind of extreme though.",

    "text": "I gave Y&A another chance because the boy wanted to go, and we hadn't had a chance to celebrate my birthday because of the food poisoning. So we had a couple of beers in the LOVELY Edinboro Castle round the corner with friends. We considered cancelling the reserrvation so we could dig into the BBQ there as it smelled SO good but opted for 'fine' dining instead. I had really high hopes from the outset. The waitress was lovely. Accommodating when i asked her if we could sit by the window (such a glorious evening) rather than the table which had been set out downstairs. Then, again, on reading the menu I had a hankering for the mackerel (my favourite fish) starter which was only on the early supper menu, she imemdiately checked with the chef and came back with a beaming \"no problem\". And when the starters arrived and they were perfection. Ollie's Ox Tongue melted in the mouth and my mackerel was perfectly flakey and not overpoweringly fishy, the croquette crispy outside and fluffy in. Beautiful. So far so good. Yay!!Then the niggles started. I ordered my FAVOURITE cocktail (you can tell I used to come here often, particualrly to prop up the bar) the Rose Garden Fizz. It was delivered \"undressed\" by a nervy young chap. I immediately commented on the fact it normally came with cucumber and that it was oversweet adn he apologised saying he'd only been there a week and he would change it. Back he came with a giant sprig of mint unceremoniously plonked in the centre of the flute. No matter. We shrugged it off with a little giggle and bemoaned the fact that Verrin the genius cocktail maker had clearly and deservedly moved on to bigger and better things; and eagerly anticipated our mains. I say mains, but I had ordered another starter, the Quail Ravioli and Ollie had orderd the saddle of lamb. And this is where it went horribly horribly wrong. The saddle of lamb arrived and though perfectly rare the puy lentils were undercooked and overseasoned. Mine. Well mine was seawater on a plate and inedible. By the time the nervy waiter chap acknowledged me Ollie was halfway through his main, he disappeared with my plate and came back 5 minutes later attributing the saltiness to the \"truffle\". Now let's back up a minute. I am not a cretin and this is not my first foray into dining out at a supposedly upscale restaurant so pleasure don't patronise me. I LOVE truffle and have never ever ever noticed it turn any dish to the Dead Sea. This infuriated me but my main concern at this moment was my growling tummy: woman cannot survive on one lonely croquette! He said making my dish again would take some time and offered to take Ollie's plate downstairs and bring with my replacement main and Ollie was already nearly finished so it made no sense and we also just didn't have the time as we had to be elsewhere within half an hour. He then disappeared for 15 minutes coming back and inappropriately, given what we had just told him, offered us dessert. I asked to see the manager, imagine my surprise when the week-old nervy employee said that he was the manager?!?! NO apology was forthcoming, though to be fair he did take the wine off the bill (we didn't even get halfway through the bottle, i would've been smashed drinking on an empty stomach!) and my main and starter, so we just paid for Ollie's starter and main. He even had the temerity to say \"I hope we see you again\" as we left. Not a chance. You blew it York & Albany.",

It's difficult for me to dine out anywhere because I'm gluten-free, but most restaurants are quite accommodating, especially upscale establishments. \u00a0York was also accommodating, but not in the way I've come to expect in the U.S. Many times the chef will whip up something as equally delicious as what's on the menu, making modifications without comprising the dish as a whole, but at York that was not the case. For a starter I had a salad, because none of the other options were wheat free in any way, which is a major negative for me as I believe all restaurants should have a variety. My main course was a halibut, which was supposed to be on a creamed corn ragout, but since I'm lactose intolerant they served it on steamed vegetables....really? \u00a0At that level, I'd expect to have something more interesting than steamed vegetables. \u00a0I could have made that dish at home and actually it would have tasted a lot better.

As it turns out, he isn't.The interior was stunning and simple, well appointed, quiet and with perfect service. There is a garden out back that you fantasize about wanting to have your friends meet you at every night in summer.The food was incredible as well, we dined a la carte, splitting an appetizer (the raviolo of hen's egg with panceta and wild mushrooms), and each having a main, she, a braised lamb shank and I the duck tortellini. To say there was a single misstep in the preparation, plating or palate of any element in these dishes would be a lie.One of the best meals of my life, and not even that expensive!",

For lunch, the 3 courses for \u00a318 sounded too good to be true. But each course was beautifully prepared and absolutely exquisite. They brought a warm chicken something or other (like a liquidy pate) for free, while we waited. I didn't like but others thought was divine. My smoked salmon was a generous slice of fillet, red in colour, salty and like nothing I had had before. Next, my cod with mussel and saffron sauce was delicate and perfectly balanced. And the pannacotta was simply divine. And the food on the a la carte looked amazing too - all very simple but I bet was amazing. That trip is saved for a date (with him paying naturally).",

Both is nice enough, although I preferred the cleaner upstairs look. Food was rave. Service was a bit amateurish, but friendly and welcoming. Try fasting for a day or two before you go, and then get the treacle sponge cake for dessert. Oh boy, never did sugar taste so good ...",

    "text": "I took advantage of the prix-fixe lunch menu on a lovely Sunday afternoon. This place didn't disappoint and was worth every penny. The service was friendly and unobstrusive. Food was well-executed and was a mixture of English classics, Italian and French. We were seated at the lower ground which was a shame as it was such a nice day. There are three distinct sections (lower ground - dark and warm with red couches and black/red undertone. I guess it's fun to be able to watch the kitchen in action down here. Upper main dining area and the round section overlooking the park - best section in my opinion). There is a bakery with yummy looking cakes attached to the restaurant as well. A very cute place for dates/lazy lunches.My friend ordered Sunday roast which was a little odd to me because most I've seen are thin slices of roast and this looked like a huge chunk of steak. He liked it though. Yorkshire pudding was fresh and crisp. I had pig's cheeks which could be more tender but pretty flavoursome- paired with fruit compote - nice but a tad sweet. I loved my entree - tomato confit with tea jelly and sheep milk yoghurt. My friend had ox tongue (thumbs up) and salmon. They both enjoyed them. We skipped dessert but they looked good. Enjoyed the experience and will come again to try the steak sandwich and other dishes that we saw coming out of the kitchen. Glad to find a place to eat at Camden!",

The greeting and service was warm and really welcoming.The restaurant is just like a living room, tasteful and cozy.The food was delicious. We thought about the early 3 course menu but decided to go a la carte. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because something was missing. It wasn't quite as special as I had hoped, I guess.Next time we're in Camden we have to go back to try the pretty outdoor seating in the back.",

I don't know what's going on with Hell's Kitchen, but I think we need to leave the cooking to the Brits. York and Albany, you had me at Chestnut and Truffle Risotto. For \u00a320/early supper 3 course meal, I could have been more than satisfied with that single dish. It was perfect. The right balance of truffle oil and cream for the risotto, with a nice roasted touch of chestnut. The main was a special holiday plate of turkey and all its fixings--the most memorable piece on that plate was the mashed potatoes (superb!). As for desert, take my advice and go with the Warm black treacle cake...but beware, that's not a scoop of vanilla ice cream..its that of its much more sophisticated, richer cousin, Ms. Clotted Cream. And a touch of espresso and warm and friendly chit chat with the server to end the meal. C'est parfait!",

If you aren't a meat eater I believe it came with prosciutto in it which they were fine leaving out by request.Seared Ahi tuna dish was good but I could've lived without.There was a truffle risotto dish wish was divine and they whipped up for me on a day it wasn't shown on the menu.Goat Cheese and Fig salad was lovely as well.Cr\u00e8me Brulee? Yes please.Service was attentive, the dining room was dim and romantic, and I didn't think the prices were out of the ordinary compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood.I will definitely return!",

    "text": "This is a difficult review, as not only had I been here and thought that it was a major let down, but my friend had been here 5 times only to be let down either by the food or the service. We were invited to the winter shed at the back of the pub, and this was a freebie to make amends for the previous poor outcomes. Obviously the setting and decor of the pub is very impressive, but when you are paying for a pricey menu, then you want value for money. This is difficult to review as obviously it was free. The venue in the back shed felt like we had just come off the ski slopes, and I enjoyed the novelty factor. We were due finger food and drinks. Starters was a chicken and sundriedbtomato sausage rollwhich I have to say was lovely and although initially reminded me of school days and a sausage roll became more once it hit my palate, well balanced flavours revealed a simple but delicate little snack. Our menu changed and we then had a slider, \u00a0which was simple and nothing more. I wasn't major impressed by the arranging and the beetroot and goats curd tartlets came out with dessert, I am a little uncertain what was going on. In short a couple of dishes were missed and the food came fast and ready.So although the food was better this time, and it is obviously a different kind of experience in a ski lodge at the back of camden, I was uncertain about the mismatch, hopscotch of the experience. We had fun and the drinks were good, so I cannot really complain. Will I return for dinner again, well that is the question. Reading some of the latest reviews suggest that there may have been a turn and something you may expect from the Ramsay factory. We shall see!",

I chose this as the spot to celebrate my Mum's birthday last week and I was rewarded with a spot in her good books. The table service for drinks were great and all the waiters are obviously well trained in what they can offer. A very extensive and defined cocktail menu gives you a lot of choice and a nicely stocked beer, wine and cider list also help. We helped ourselves to a few bar snacks and for a Friday evening it was filled with a good amount of people. Averagely busy but not too loud and overpowering. I'll be back to check the grub out.

    "text": "My happy place.Went with wife and son when we were in town earlier this month for dinner. \u00a0Hadn't planned on going but when I discovered that our hotel was a short cab ride away, just the other side of Regent's Park, well, I made sure to have our concierge make reservations for Friday night dinner.Reservations were a bit early for me, i.e., 6:45, but what the heck. \u00a0Appeared on time, were warmly welcomed by the hostess, and was immediately impressed with open, airy, space on the first floor, the large bar area, cool art adorning the walls, and huge windows/french doors opening onto the balmy London eve. \u00a0Also noted that this must be a pretty cool place to come based on the appearance (very nice) and attire (classy but not OTT) of the other patrons. \u00a0With our 14 year old son accompanying us, I initially felt a bit out of place.We were seated downstairs with a view of the open kitchen so I got to see the chefs at work, hear meals being prepared, and wow, what a totally cool, not-to-be-missed experience. \u00a0So, if they seat you downstairs, don't fret, it's not because they don't like you or think you're too uncool to sit upstairs, no, it's because that way you get to appreciate the wonder that is a Gordon Ramsay kitchen. \u00a0Seriously, the place was cleaner than a surgical theater and probably more efficient.Not to worry, our very energetic, friendly, knowledgeable waiter (and knowledgeable about everything on the menu), Michael, put us at ease. \u00a0I had some bourbon-based cocktail with red wine (specialty of the house) that was sweet, smoky, and kind of berryish. \u00a0Menus arrived and we ordered starters, I had a tomato salad and wife had a mixed greens, both fresh, excellent, and my tomatoes, man oh man, those things were perfect: \u00a0Salty, sweet, juicy. \u00a0Oh yeah, presentation was gorgeous.Next came time to order our main course: \u00a0Son (king of the picky eaters) was a bit put off by the complexity of the courses. \u00a0Never fear, Michael to the rescue. \u00a0\"Oh, and we have kids menu that has pasta, chicken fingers, pizza. \u00a0Would you like to see that?\" \u00a0Son's eyes light up at mention of pasta. \u00a0So, all the way to London from Chicago to a Gordon Ramsay joint, and he orders plain pasta. \u00a0Sigh. \u00a0I ordered the fish special, I believe it was bream and the wife also ordered fish, sea bass. \u00a0We could hear and see our food being made and saw it appear in the window and the chef looked right at us, nodded, and said with a grin, \"It'll be there soon.\"Wow. \u00a0Mine was perfect and perfectly presented: \u00a0Skin charred just right on a bed of pickled greens with EVOO, salty yet creamy and crunchy and buttery and round and I'm going to have to stop now as I'm drooling on my keyboard. \u00a0My wife's was excellent as well, or so she said. \u00a0I also ordered white wine with dinner; Kentish wine, as I was told. \u00a0And shockingly, yes, shockingly, it was very good. \u00a0I actually had two glasses. \u00a0And it went perfectly with the bream. \u00a0Go figure.Dessert too, was a treat. \u00a0Son had mint chocolate chip covered in fudge sauce and wife had a toffee/coffee crust vanilla ice cream creation that touched all the bases: \u00a0Crunchy, sweet, creamy, salty, a little bitterness from the coffee. \u00a0That dessert was perfection itself.As the meal was winding down, the manager, Nigel, came down and chatted with us as did the hostess/assistant manager (I didn't catch her name). \u00a0We talked Kentish wine, food, travel, and accents. \u00a0I've never before been told that I have a \"lovely\" accent. \u00a0Heh.As we left, we thanked the chef and talked to her for a bit.What a truly phenomenal, once-in-a-lifetime experience. \u00a0If you go, and you should, savor it. \u00a0It's worth it.",

The drink menu was very creative, though our bartender was slow in pouring and not to friendly in the beginning. She later lightened up after she realized that she needed to work for her tip. \u00a0 Our waitress and the bus boy were spot on throughout the entire night. Both were very personable and friendly, sharing their stories with my table. I enjoyed my starter dish of the assiette of rabbit. \u00a0The rabbit was tender and served with several small raw pieces and an inner as well. I think it was kidney. \u00a0 My main was the partridge. Not having partridge before, I didn't know what to expect that it maybe tasting like chicken. \u00a0 Served with savoy cabbage, the flavor of the partridge melted in my mouth with every chew. I savored each bite and knew that I really liked this bird. We topped dinner with desserts: they treacle sponge pudding with anglaise and the pineapple and passion fruit cannelloni. Both were good, but the entire table preferred the sponge pudding. Everyone was fighting for the dish and each persons scoop was larger than the next until there was nothing left. Tough I had concern of eating at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant due to the current state of his empire, I am glad that I did. As this meal did not disappoint and ended my holiday on a proper note.",

To be safe, we reserved a table via Open Table for a late evening dinner on a Friday. \u00a0We arrived a few minutes early and were given the choice of a drink at the bar or to be immediately seated. \u00a0We chose the latter and were taken to a corner table in the back dining area. \u00a0The place wasn't very busy for a Friday, but perhaps that's because we arrived around the 9 o'clock hour. \u00a0We sat for a good 25 minutes before anyone approached our table, and she only did so because she was told to by the manager. \u00a0There was no greeting, just the server immediately asking how can I help you? \u00a0No, \"welcome can I get you some drinks?\" \u00a0Just \"How can I help you?\", as if we were in a retail store. We were all taken aback by this, but proceeded to order. My husband ordered a bourbon, and despite repeating himself several times, the waitress didn't understand what he was saying. \u00a0Instead of getting someone else to help, he sat drinkless for another 30 minutes until I got her attention and asked about it. \u00a0She responded as if she had remembered and left to go get it from the bar. \u00a0However, the manager came over and discretely told my husband that the server couldn't understand what he was trying to order (Larceny Bourbon), and took the order for her. \u00a0This would not have happened unless we had gotten her attention the second time. \u00a0MEANWHILE, our table sat drinkless, except for my friend that ordered Sparkling Water. \u00a0That arrived 20 minutes after we ordered, but for whatever reason our caraffe of Still Water took another 20 minutes. \u00a0The food was prepared perfectly and was absolutely delicious (except for a friend that ordered the pasta dish, which she said was bland). To be honest, it was the saving grace of this review. \u00a0The service issues continued when we needed our bill. \u00a0We had to request it after our server seemingly disappeared. \u00a0We had given her a head's up at the beginning of the meal that we needed to have separate checks, but we received one check. \u00a0We then divvied everything up ourselves, and had them run cards separately.It's not a cheap restaurant, and sadly the service didn't live up to the price and expectations.",

I have to say I am not a fan of the TV shows and I am not a sycophant of Mr Ramsey.Okay - to conclude I liked this place - a lot - maybe I am saying this as I am still a little squiffy from the two strong cocktails and the half bottle of red wine I drank (yes yes \u00a0I am a cheap drunk....and easy to take advantage off....god I am still squiffy)...So my portion of the meal (cocktails, wine, starters, main and dessert) was around GBP70. I have to say the whole thing was worth it.To begin with we sat at the bar for an hour and took recommendations from a very nice italian barman - who seemed to know his stuff. Actually all of the bar men were very nice and very helpful...all of the cocktails recommended were spot on...good going guys...I would recommend the bar area on its own.We then took sunday dinner...unfortunately the downstairs dining area was shut so we ate upstairs. Despite this it was actually a nice dining experience.The staff in general were spot on ....just what you would want from wait and bar staff..not pretentious...not stuffy....they were professional..courteous and they did their job. In fact that sums up the atmosphere....relaxed and not pretentious. The music was so light it was barely noticeable. Thou I am assured they also have a live piano player (as opposed to a dead one?) who plays excellantly.The food was delcious...though I noticed the conspicuous absence of salt and pepper from the table.....but who cares....the food was great. Okay okay ....did I mention I was squiffy......For a main I had the lamb shank - and despite it being white plate food the flavour was all there. Maybe it is because I am glutinous but I would have liked a little more food on my plate. The desert was gorgeous too.Anyway I will need to review this review when I am sober as it probably sounds like I want to have Ramsey's love child. I don't. This is an honest and earnest review.",

    "text": "What a fantastic day I had at the York & Albany. Ok, this review is a little bit biased as I was here for a wedding but still, the service was flawless, the food was delicious and the hotel itself was beautiful. The happy couple were married in a small ceremony in a room flanked by bay windows with the autumn sun streaming in. Gospel singers were hidden from the bride in a room at the back (I later discovered it was a toilet...poor ladies!) and came out after the ceremony to treat us to a rendition of 'All You Need Is Love' a la Love Actually. It's one of those moments you wish life was a film as I wanted to get up and dance or play an instrument or something, alas we did the British thing of just listening politely and clapping along. A short drinks reception was held in Nonna's Deli, attached to the hotel, with tasty mojitos before we were ushered downstairs for the meal. Oh. My. God. The meal was amazing. I mean, it's Gordon Ramsay's hotel so I guess the food would have to be good but still. I had the pepper stuffed with pureed aubergine and whipped goats cheese to start, pork belly with crackling (yum!), spinach, black cabbage and potatoes as a main and then sex on a plate for pudding - aka chocolate fondant with vanilla and pistachio ice cream. Warm chocolate fondant which oozed chocolate sauce from the centre in such a seductive way it took all my strength not to just stick my face in it. We were moved back up to Nonna's Deli for tea, coffee and yummy cup cakes (I wasn't hungry but forced one down, purely in the name of research for my review of course). Then back downstairs where they had cleared the tables for dancing. Mid way through the night (when A LOT of alcohol had been consumed) the DJ announced there were bacon sarnies upstairs. Warm, crusty, buttered ciabatta bread and thick slices of bacon. Oh Gordon, with these bacon sarnies you're really spoiling us! The bar is pricey but this didn't come as a shock considering where we were, and the bar staff were so friendly and understanding (dealing with drunk wedding guests!) The hotel itself is near to Camden and all it's delights, and just around the corner from the fab Edinboro Castle pub. I even popped up to check out one of the rooms (nosy!) and it was nice but quite small! I have no idea how much it costs to stay.Thanks York & Albany - a fabulous day all round. I may need to come back for another plate of sex - I mean chocolate fondant - soon!",

    "text": "The nice, light interior with high ceiling, looking very stylish, is very inviting. The downstairs seems quite cosy but the ground floor gains by having a skylight and big windows letting in a lot of light. I was going to have the set lunch menu but decided to go for the Sunday roast as I saw it pass by. It turned out to be a very good choice with a good filling portion of perfectly cooked beef roast with Yorkshire pudding, carrots, roast potatoes and spinach with a generous helping of gravy. The dessert was polenta cake, lemon verbena foam and blackberry sorbet. It was all nice but to be honest I was expecting a bit more, especially the polenta cake was missing that little bit of extra. Unfortunately the service left a lot to be desired. Very lacklustre, seemed quite disinterested in taking orders. The food almost made up for it, but just almost. I will be coming back again to try the other dishes and hopefully the service will be better that time.",

Wow, what a little gem in Camden!I had assumed Y&A was going to be a slightly more upscale gastropub. Not so much. The service was impeccable. The bar area and the dining area in which we sat were comfortable and the atmosphere was very pleasant. Even the journey downstairs to the loo was pleasant (you can even glimpse the kitchen). I decided on the 3 course for \u00a322.00. My starter was an amazing curly kale and chestnut tart (I'd go back again just for that). I ordered the beetroot risotto (after watching so many eps of Hell's Kitchen I really needed to see what his kitchen produced in the way of risotto). It was amazing. And what a wonderful color! I chose the cheese plate for dessert and enjoyed their selections. The wine list was also nice and affordable. I just wish I lived closer to go back again!",

I was here with colleagues while on a business trip and despite the fact that we had a reservation and the place was empty, we were there for 2 hours (mostly because the service was lousy).However the food was amazing. For someone in search for your quintessential Fish and Chips, the rumors are true Gordon knows how to do it best. Another amazing item on the list was the Banana Bread Sticky Toffee Pudding, served with Banana Bread Ice Cream. Despite the service, I still recommend a visit, just make sure not to have a tight schedule when dining.",

    "text": "Purely by virtue of the quality of food, this is the best Gordon Ramsay affiliated restaurant I've tried in London, better than Heddon Street Kitchen and Maze Grill. Of course all the restaurants serve a slightly different style of menu.\u00a0York and Albany manages to bring magic to seemingly ordinary recipes. With British classics like fish pie and apple tart you may not think that there is much room to impress but here the chef reminds us why these are classics in the first place by bringing out the best in their taste, texture and presentation. Simple yet sublime. Sometimes it takes more skill to make something fantastic out of something simple than to hide under a multitude of ingredients.\u00a0The quinoa salad was delicious (which I often think is hard to achieve with a salad!), the potato on the fish pie was delightfully fluffy and uniform and the fish soft and fresh. When it came time for desserts my friend and I did not think we could fit much more in our stomachs but with the very first glorious bite of each one, there was an instantaneous understanding that not one bite could be left behind. Sweet but not too sweet, well baked and beautifully matched with their prospective ice creams, the desserts rounded off a perfectly executed meal.\u00a0\u00a0In short, York and Albany may seem somewhat out of the way and unassuming from the outside with a brazenly bare yet loyally British menu but what it served up was what we British say is \"bloody brilliant\".",

I was nervous because we'd been here last year and weren't too fond of the service but (round of applause) they have seriously improved! We booked for a party of four and ended up being six and no one batted an eyelash. I don't recommend doing this btw but in our case it simply couldn't be helped =^.~=Luck was in our favor because our table was right by the garden. Our food was great and the conversation flowed from table to table. The dish I actually enjoyed most was our starter, the mackerel + beetroot salad. Simple yet flavorful. I also tried the ginger toffee pudding and mustard mash with beef medallions. Both were tasty but the star of the meal was the baked fish salad and the pig's head croquettes my Mom ordered. I'd always thought she orders it because the name is fun to say but it's a sweet and sour concoction with this incredible sauce! The sauce is so rich you really could put it on anything and the little dish they put the pickles on is so cuuuutte.So, all in all I had a great time with the family and I'm glad we gave this place another shot.",

However after struggling to find seats at the bar we had to wait some time before they took our drinks order (most of the time no one was behind the bar). Then unfortunately no one came to us to tell us our table was ready, we had to ask ourselves.Once we ordered food and drink, a beer didn't come for a while because 'the bar was busy'. The starters took a while but they were very nice. The main was also nice but the potato pur\u00e9e was cold and seemed to have been under a heat lamp. The dessert then took a very long time to arrive and then so did the bill, then as we were waiting to pay they gave us the bill again! Clearly a lack of communication. We then had to get up to pay.Overall the service didn't make sense, there was two waiters in formal jackets that seems to be the 'main' waiters who were very busy. There was then a 'trail' waiter who was very attentive but couldn't take orders. Then there was several people in kitchen-like outfits that just dropped off the food. So many people yet the service was poor, it didn't make sense. Our dining experience was 2.5/3 hours even though we didn't want that.Tl;dr food was good, service was poor.",

For a meal that costs as much as this one does, I expect a lot more.As a party of 6, we were having a lovely time, so weren't that distressed (except about the cocktail menu - not ok!), but it did take us 4.5 hours to have dinner.The food was fantastic, but it's not cheap and I expect service to match the food and prices, which sadly it just really didn't.Oh side note: Don't order off the cocktail menu - they have a full bar, but they don't seem to really know how to make off-menu drinks. The four people who ordered on menu had lovely cocktails, and the two of us who tried something else were a bit let down.",

    "text": "I discovered this place by chance after finding everywhere else in Camden was busy. And this place had lovely outdoor seating at the front and amazing restaurant seating inside with an open kitchen and a beautiful bar. We tried their unique cocktails and ordered again and again. Plus their freshly made pizza and the chunkiest hips ever was a perfect unplanned dinner. On a second visit tried the sea bass with the mash potatoes baked perfectly. Would recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "Came here for afternoon tea week and really enjoyed my experience! The service was amazing and the food - for the most part - was great too. We had reservations for 3 pm and were seated right away in at a lovely table by the window. I (unsurprisingly) ordered the afternoon tea set with green tea. Within 5 minutes the tea came out and within another 5 minutes our tower arrived. My goodness, I was SO excited when I saw it - everything looked beautiful, from the sandwiches to the raspberry trifle.Now onto the actual taste. I enjoyed the sandwiches for the most part (salmon was definitely my favorite but I love salmon anyway), but the bread was softer than I would've preferred and it often stuck to the roof of my mouth which I didn't like so much. As for the sweets, the trifle tasted amazing - just not the whipped cream on top, which I thought made the dessert a bit too heavy. The pistachio macaron was...let's say, interesting. It wasn't your traditional macaron - the inside was very runny and the shell wasn't soft on the inside, which is a requirement I have for good macaroons. The taste was decent, though. The eclair was pretty good, but perhaps had a little too much chocolate drizzle on the top. The blueberry tart had a great taste - I just wish the texture would have been softer/easier to cut through. And the scones...I don't know what it is about British scones but that's the part of afternoon tea that I always look forward to most! These scones did not disappoint, and neither did the clotted cream/jam. The flavor was on point and although the texture could have been softer/more melty on the inside and perhaps served warm as well, I enjoyed it.Overall, I'd recommend this place for afternoon tea. While - looking back - the food was decent but nothing particularly special, the service was spectacular and so was the tea. Definitely try to come here for afternoon tea before the week ends! It's an incredible offer for what you get.",

As we were dining early we chose the set menu they had available until 7 pm. Very good selection and I had the plaice which was cooked to perfection. Had the brownie and caramel ice cream for dessert which was also good. Great dining experience. Service was good and friendly.",

    "text": "We originally booked Christmas dinner here because we knew it was a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and we had a WONDERFUL experience at Heddon Street Kitchen (another Ramsay restaurant). Unfortunately, it was bad almost as soon as we entered the place. To begin, there was an awkward coat check. The person running the coat check was very kind, and probably the best staff we had all evening, but we were awkwardly taking off our coats and handing them to him while also being rushed to our table. Another note about the coat check system is that at the end of the evening they had trouble locating our coats so we had to search through the awkwardly placed closet ourselves. Upon sitting down we waited a good while for anyone to pay attention to us and take our orders; 20 minutes. The next issue was the drinks came after two starter courses. However, we did have water at the table. My main course was beef wellington and it was quite apparent it sat under a heat lamp. It was barely warm when it arrived at my table and got cool very quickly; unpleasant. The courses were also timed oddly. We never had one consistent waiter attending to us, when they even bothered to act like we were there. Glasses piled up on the table and we were asked about a refill or other beverage once during the meal, and that was after WE got someone's attention. It all felt very uncomfortable, awkward, and confusing. The soup at the start of the evening and the dessert at the end were the highlights; both delicious. Overall, our experience was unpleasant and disappointing, especially when considering it was a Christmas meal we paid quite a bit for.",

The service matched the food:Impeccable. I am not just saying that because i am american and usually dine at Burker King and Subway ; ) Everything was fresh, the wine list phenomenal and we look forward to our next visit!",

    "text": "I think Mr. Ramsey needs to check in regarding QC at this place. We were a party of 6 adults and 2 children. Although the waiter was great at ensuring the kids got fed quickly and also correctly ensured two in our party had the changes to their meals (one with no mustard in mash and the other switching mash to chips), the food was sub par.Braised cheeks with mash were barely warm and the mash was cold. As anyone with kids in tow knows, one does not have the luxury to send a meal back or they risk running the meal too late for impatient toddlers. So, 3 of us suffered through those plates. One of us also found that the beer he had at first had run out before he ordered his second one - and it was only 6:15pm!!Worst of all follows:Saturdays prime roast special was... fish pie (no roasts available)! \u00a0Really??Desserts were plain awful. Toffee pudding was more like a dried cake and was served without any sauce. Tarte tatin was a precooked slice upside down apple pie with a whisp of caramel. Last time we were here we thought some of the issues were one off problems. This trip confirmed it - save your money and eat elsewhere until Mr. Ramsey does a shake up in this namesake restaurant!",
