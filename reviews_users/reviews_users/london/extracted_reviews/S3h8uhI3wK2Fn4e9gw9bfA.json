    "text": "I'll start with the positives because i don't want to come across as (too much of) a curmudgeonly git.It's a good use of space compared to the quasi derelict hovel it used to be, and to be fair they've done a good job with decor and atmosphere - it's quite cosy and \"hip\" feeling, as you'd expect from a coffee shop on the corner of hipster-ville. It's also a nice touch that they have a small wet bar serving a few decent spirits; their cakes looked ok. Oh...and it was heated; and it was very cold outside.Now the negatives - maybe i just have a wildly different notion of what coffee should taste like, but being italian, having lived in paris for a long while and having worked as a barista throughout my youth in many of London's popular caff\u00e8s i feel i know my way around an espresso machine; but in my opinion their coffee was not good. There are almost no words to describe how stomach-churningly disgusting the espresso i had there the other day, was. I once had some friends play a practical joke on me by adding a dollop of ketchup to an espresso i ordered, while my head was turned, which i then proceeded to drink...this one tasted worse. It was as if somebody had emptied half a salt shaker in there. This is normally an indication of someone having burned the beans/coffee from packing it too tight or updosed/under-extracted. Either way a barista should have played the trial & error game in his own time to get the extraction right. Adding insult to injury is the fact that a single espresso costs \u00a32.10!!! almost twice as much as many other small, independent places (that do a far superior coffee). What is it with hipsters that makes them think it's a good idea to rip everybody off for a simple product offering? Im sure this will provoke much bemoaning about how their latte/flat whie/capuccino are wonderful, but the espresso is the building block of any caf no matter how much cream and chocolate powder you use to mask the salty horror.Not wanting to condemn somewhere just on a one-off (every one has a bad day), i tried it again the following day, but the experience was the same.",

    "text": "Lovely shop, great coffee, ace atmosphere, but rubbish service. Shoreditch Grind is the perfect little coffee shop in Shoreditch. It's hipster-y, but not in an obnoxious way. Music is played loud, but not too loud, it's all wood and spray painted logos inside. People with asymetrical haircuts mingle with tech dudes in regulation light-blue-shirt-and-khaki-chinos. People fiddle with their iPad or tap away (on a novel I presume) on their stickered laptop. The coffe tastes really good - a little small, but that's because I'm used to chain coffe place giganto cups. The cake and pastery selection is also very impressive. Thing is though - the staff were pretty crap. One guy was behind the counter and didn't serve. The main barista took ages to acknowledge my presence and was really, very quiet and a little miserable, and the one manning the machine I heard say 'arrgh my brain!' (or something like that) after a few too many orders at once. At least in corperate-coffeville the staff are well trained and helpful. Sort out the staff, and five stars will be yours.",

I'd rather go somewhere where the staff are recruited on basis of their customer service skills and not the contents of their wardrobe.A perfect example of style over substance.",

Maybe it's just my taste in coffee, but I've now come twice to the Grind, and I have to agree with Larissa. There's something lacking in their coffee. I've been to Taylor Street Baristas, and Speakeasy, Monmouth and Workshop, and while this is decent coffee in London, it's a bit like old world vs new world wines. The coffee here has a very delicate flavour to it, but it certainly lacks punch. It's very drinkable, but definitely lacks a unique flavour. It's akin to drinking a starbucks latte in a pretentious looking shop. The decor is cool, and rocking, but not the coffee. Anyone got suggestions for decent coffee in the area? #Notcomingback",

Sorry, dodgy kebab shops, Linzi has no love for you. It's not me, it's you, you're a 3am mistake that I would never make. I love the wraparound windows and the cinema style signage (displaying 'coffee makes you last longer' cheeky messaging). Inside it's very Shoreditch hip with matching cute baristas. The non-tattooed need not apply.It reminds me of JJ Bean in Vancouver, I'll never truly feel I'm cool enough to be in there. But what I am cool enough to be is gainfully employed and can afford your expensive coffee and gorgeous looking almond croissants. I'll see you in the morning, SG. Make mine a double.",

    "text": "I dropped in to Shoreditch Grind this morning as I was working in the area and had been wanting to try the place out. If I could give the place three-and-a-half stars I would, but as I can't, I'm erring on the side of caution.The interiors and external fa\u00e7ade are possibly the best thing about the coffee shop for me. The faux cinema-style signage out front is eye-catching, with the (presumably ever-changing) sub-text below the caf\u00e9's name urging you to \"Flick Your Coffee Bean\". I'm all for caffeinated innuendo, but this seems a little forced; perhaps a good analogy for the rest of the operation?The problem for me is twofold. The coffee itself is actually rather average when compared to places like Prufrock or Caravan nearby, with predominantly disinterested or too-cool-for-school baristas (some of whom I've seen elsewhere, such as Lantana) serving up lukewarm 6oz cups of mild disappointment.Additionally, whilst the place is cool to look at outside and in, with only a bar around the edge and a single communal table it doesn't really lend itself to being a sit-down-relax-and-exchange-conversation/ideas type of place. Which is what a coffee shop is all about after the quality of the coffee, right?Don't get me wrong, this coffee served from their La Marzocco still beats the hell out of a roasted-to-oblivion EAT or Pret job, but the location and staffing just meant for me that a takeaway seemed the best option. When your immediate opinion of a place is that you want to get out of it soon after arriving, the omens are not the best.I'm still not convinced, but at the same time it's really worth a poke. To be fair also, the prices are pretty damn solid and cheaper than the chains. I sure don't mind the Shoreditch Grind - I just couldn't ever see myself loving it.",

And it wasn't bad at all. Not amazing mind you but better than most. Small space but I like the way they've sorted out seating and the food displays. Makes me want to buy everything on that damn counter. There's seating all around the edge and a communal style table a little off center of the room.

I love the design of the interior, so I was pretty excited as I approached the barista.The two or three staff who served us gave us snooty attitudes, making us feel like we were completely uncool or just not good enough for their place. (OMG, it's not even an independent shop!!) \u00a0So, though we wanted to have a treat, the way they were glaring at us while we were trying to decide made us so uncomfortable we didn't order anything to eat. Husband just ordered a flat white and I ordered a mocha because I wanted chocolate.When our coffees came, we tried each other's drinks and both thought that, on the whole, the drinks were too milky. Of course, I'm one who likes her coffees with a big kick, so maybe I'm just not a big fan of the beans they're using. My second time (flat white) ended with the same conclusion, though, so, hey, it's just not for me.HOWEVER, their cocktails do sound very interesting... I'll be back to try those, but I'm not sure if I'll be back too soon for the coffee.",

The beans are great, the overall decor of the place is great and the coffee when delivered correctly is great.

It's becoming my local spot with my boyfriend before he sends me home. It is a shame it is so small so like many Yelpers have said, it's not a place you can sit for long and wind down as you're more likely to find yourself a window seat on a high stool than a table seat. But saying that one of the best things about it is that it is also open late, till 1am on the weekends.But the place holds a good vibe, probably because they sell coffee cocktails but I am also impressed they serve their own branded coffee and there's a deli bar where cakes, sandwiches and hot soups are available. Sadly I've only tried their hot chocolate and latte but they were good. Both personalised for me with a nice \u00a0fancy latte art. In fact that barista was so impressed with what he had achieved he came back to take a photo of his art which was funny. My hot chocolate was so indulgent, it was thick, rich and smooth. The nice foam on top created a layer of bliss as it lighten it up a bit. Not only did it taste good but it looked amazing, cute even.My latte met everything I needed from a good latte. It came in the perfect temperature, a good layer of foam and a nice richness coming through the creamy steamed milk. In the summer I can see myself sitting on the outside beaches watching life go by \u00a0the old street roundabout. It is memorising and somewhat a nice distraction from city life. The place itself could do with more comfortable seating, maybe fit a few retro sofas in. The place has so much life and so much potential but it's a shame there's not enough space for people to add to it. Still I love the place. Just people would just go away and let me have a seat :p.",

Their other coffees are great, and the food is genuinely brilliant most of the time. Of course the unique building and great location add to the lovin'.But, I also hate it (a teeny, tiny, small, fraction of a bit); it can get very busy at peak times. Like, \"wow, I'll go next to [insert corporate 'coffee' chain] instead\" busy. Also, the staff seem to have their on and off days. Most of the time they are very pleasant but other times they seem either like they're on the come-down from hell and give you 'the death stare'.In fact, ignore me - it's brilliant - try it!",

I gave them my standard cappuccino test. The coffee here is good, better than many places in London. The Canadian barista was wondering where we were from, and he was surprised to hear that I was from a place even further north than he was.While the coffee was good, I'm not sure I'd come back. Unfortunately there's a much better coffee place quite close by with amazing coffee. Given that it's hard to find good coffee in London, I imagine if it was just in a different location, I'd probably be more willing to come back.",

I was wandering around until I stumbled upon Shoreditch Grind and remembered it was on a list of top coffee shops to try; so I decided to pop in.I ordered a Mocha and eggs with avocado on sourdough toast. The man who took my order seemed indifferent, so I can't comment on friendly service. There seems to be 4-5 people behind the bar, but 2 pulling shots of espresso.While I was waiting for my order to arrive, a few thing stuck out to me:- Non-working Wi-Fi.- Complaints about the outlets not working, however, I cannot attest to this as I didn't need to charge anything.- Uncomfortable seats along the windows.- Indifferent customer service.I would understand popping in here for a cup of coffee before heading off to work; however, the experience here is nothing spectacular, so it's not somewhere I would go out of my way for.If you are a coffee enthusiast, stop by and try their shots, but otherwise, I'd move along.",

It's a bit of a scene, and on an extremely busy roundabout/tube station (Old Street), but don't let that stop you from poking your head in. The median age of constituents seems to be about 25...and the acoustics make it seem like there are 100 people in there instead of 25, but none the less...this is Shoreditch and you likely need some caffeine, so get you some.I had planned on maybe staying for a bit but it was just a bit too chaotic, and not many seats (perhaps they have seating upstairs? I am not sure...I didn't venture up the staircase), had we been rocking some more temperate weather, their outside seating is nothing to shake your head at. It's incredible, despite the busy environs...it's an oasis. However, it's officially December so I wasn't expecting patio weather. If you're looking for a bit quieter spot to perch, check out Pitfield a few blocks away. Got my Americano to take away, all staff was nice enough (not overly nice mind you, would you be if you had to take orders over all that noise!?), the music selection solid and the vibe one of happily caffeinated hipsters in the prime of their lives. Also, they serve drinks at night I hear. Will certainly be back for that. I'll make it part of my rotation. Good, strong coffee and a pretty kick ass marquee.",

I've always been pleased with the coffee here, having tried a few single origins that they serve as standard in black coffee (which is great). This week I tried the food and was perfectly satisfied by my smashed avocado and poached eggs on toast. If the weather was different i would feel like I was back in Australia.

And the least I can say is... \u00a0I did well finally stopping by, especially on a (very rare) lovely sunny day in London. Perfect spot for a casual meeting.My friend had some tea, I had my classic Iced Coffee of \"hot\" days. She liked her tea, nothing special. I did really love my coffee. Not the best I had in London for sure, but it was very good and refreshing. We sat at the back terrace, a truly amazing spot for this location. A lovely time, for a very decent price. I was honestly \"expecting\" it to be more expensive given the location, so the bill was a bit of a surprise. A pleasant one, indeed.If you enjoy the hecticness of Old Street and hang out around Shoreditch, give this grind a try. Good coffee, lovely baristas and waitresses. Actually, very lovely waitresses. I most definitely will go there again for a coffee break in the area!",

    "text": "The coffee world is a small one. You could almost describe it as somewhat incestuous. If you speak to somebody in coffee chances are they'll know somebody you know. It's also often known, unfortunately, for being wanky (for want of a better word). The thing is, more often than not, it really isn't. You can chat to the barista behind the machine and ask questions about your coffee and they'd be more than happy to chat away. Then you get those places where you walk in and the weight of the judgement hits you before you've even reached the counter to order. One such place attuned to the latter is most definitely Shoreditch Grind. On a brief stopover in London my other half and I wanted to scope out some good coffee spots. The Grinds always come recommended so we figured we would stop in Shoreditch Grind and check it out. Biggest mistake of my entire trip to Europe (and that includes a night I mixed vodka and red wine on an empty stomach whilst on a train...). I ordered 2 double espressos but I also really felt like a milky coffee. Being lactose intolerant I opted for a soy latte but, before ordering, I asked one barista - let's call him curls - if their soy separated in the coffee. Curls said \"sometimes but not really, we use bonsoy so it's good milk\". Winner! Milky coffee on the way - soy latte, no foam. Well, coffee arrives. Two single shot espressos and a separated soy latte with a good inch of foam on top. We drank the espressos rather than letting them know they weren't what we had ordered. I then gave the latte a good stir and let it settle twice to see if it would be okay. No such luck, it was pretty dead so I took it over and asked if they could make it again, this time with no foam (like I had initially asked for) but maybe if they used only one shot it would be less likely to curdle; I won't go into why but it's an acid to milk thing, science and that. So as I head over to my seat the rambunctious barista with the \"I haven't had a shower in 5 days\" grease and bad tattoos, we'll call him Portly, starts shouting loudly for all to hear \"WHO ORDERED A SOY LATTE?! WELL IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO SPLIT. WHAT, SHE WANTS ONE SHOT? WELL FINE. I'LL GIVE IT TO HER IN SEPARATE GLASSES AND SHE CAN MIX IT HERSELF HARHARHAR\" Genuinely? I thought he was kidding. It was probably what he thought was an in joke to those in coffee regarding the recent Melbourne cafe that successfully broke the Internet by serving up a \"deconstructed coffee\". How wrong I was. Out comes a deconstructed coffee for me to make myself. Behind the bar Portly is still laughing at his hilarious stunt. Naturally, I walk up to the counter and request a refund. Curls let's me politely know my coffee is on the way as Portly looks up and realises, sheepishly, that I wasn't sitting outside like he had originally thought but in fact had heard everything he said. As I said I didn't appreciate the way they had spoken about me and my coffee order, I was told I had \"misheard\". He then tried to make out like he had being doing me a favour by allowing me to make the drink myself, pretending like I couldn't possibly have heard him laughing about how hilarious it would be to \"just make her do it herself\". No, no, it was just a \"misunderstanding\" to which I promptly replied \"it wasn't a misunderstanding at all, I heard what you said and it was you thinking you're funny and just being a rude d*ck\". Okay, calling him names wasn't my finest moment but it was true... I then waited at the till for my refund as loud Mr Portly had gone sheepishly quiet but still shout-whispered \"kill me now\" repetitively. Thanks Shoreditch Grind for keeping up the \"all baristas are pretentious wankers\" image alive and kicking. I'll just head over to Ozone coffee instead. (For those in the area, you make a swift body swerve around the Grind to the opposite side of the roundabout and its down an alley, only about 3 minutes away.)",

I didn't try the coffee, but I did try the espresso martini, and it was delightful. I don't normally go in for sweet cocktails but this was a nice caffeine-laden pre-dinner drink on a warm afternoon.There is plentiful outdoor space to enjoy your beverage, and interesting graffiti in the restroom if you need entertainment in the loo.",

I finally popped in yesterday to grab a coffee and it had me wondering why it had taken me so long to make a visit. I had originally ordered a flat white, but then changed my mind at the last second and ordered the Hot Flat White Russian. (It's pretty common knowledge amongst my friends that I have a loving relationship with spiked coffees - there's always a bottle of Bailey's in my cupboards.) I'm so glad I switched for the boozed filled version of the flat white. It was DELISH. It was just what I needed on a Thursday late afternoon/early evening after a long day at work. Haven't had a regular cup of joe here so I can't really comment on that, but based on their espresso based cocktails, I'm gonna say they're pretty fab. Can't wait to get back there!",

A small place to be sure, but we were seated right away despite the busyness. I got an ice coffee and it was SO GOOD. The first actually good iced coffee I've had since moving to London. So for me, that's worth five stars in itself. The waiter was super kind which was nice. The breakfast food was exactly on point, though my poached eggs may have been a bit over done. Definitely a hipster atmosphere, which is to be expected for the location. Shoreditch Grind is a must go to experience in my opinion.",

Pastries and cakes are yummy and their menu is really good. The green smoothie is really tasty and the cacao pieces are yum!I tried the granola smoothie bowl. I thought it would be like an Acai bowl, which it kinda is, but it's not as good or naturally sweet. It's filling though and a good portion. Always see people ordering eggs, or avocado toast on weekends, which I've never tried here.Definitely worth a visit and it's great for people watching!",

It's worth it for all the people watching you get to do and soak up the ambiance of the city, though.The coffee here is freaking amazing. They have all the different offerings a good coffeeshop should have, including Nitro Cold Brew. They're roasting it up right, too, because that ever-sought-out robust coffee flavor is present in all of their drinks.The food is great, as well. It's a modest menu, but hearty and fairly healthy. Their sourdough toast with butter and jam is on the harder side, but still good. And their hot porridge with coconut milk, summer berries, and chia seeds is just what the doctor ordered for a complete healthy breakfast to go with your morning java. They also serve salads, eggs, focaccia, salmon, and plenty of other healthy breakfast items, including cold-pressed juices until 3PM on the weekdays and 5PM on Saturdays, and until closing time on Sundays. If that sounds too healthy for you, they serve your quintessential cafe pastries here, as well.",

Happiness in a bowl. -smashed avocado+smoked salmon on toast: pretty solid. Loved the chili slicers. Tasted even better with a crack or black pepper + squeeze of lemon. - banana bread with creme fraiche: liked that the bread was overly sweet. Warm and toasty, topped with honey and creme. -fresh pressed red juice: consisted of apples + beetroot + blackberry + banana: really fresh, but a tad sweet for my liking. My friend also really enjoyed their coffee. We were so stuffed from our quick stop here. A great alternative if you want a delicious breakfast on the go. Would like to come back for more!",

    "text": "Very cool place. I had some time to kill before getting on a shuttle to Stansted, so at 7am, my friend and I desperately needed a cup of coffee to get us through the coming hours of Ryanair agony. I had their latte, no complaints. I shared the blueberry muffin, which pleasantly surprised me. Instead of just dried blueberries, it had a gooey center. Clearly fresh baked (and yummy). The baristas were sweet, and it seemed like lot of people popped in before work to grab a cup to go. The ambiance is trendy, and I'd recommend stopping in!",

The portion sizes are a tad on the small side for what you're paying but it is a nice environment and good food! The music can be a little loud and it is quite busy but it's definitely got that city brunch feel!",

    "text": "Perched at the crossroads like a dust-covered drifter with an illy cup is his hand is the best coffee in Old Street. Five star brew at the roundabout? Yep. I admit that I'm shootin' from the hip on this one, and am likely to put someone's eye out, but they are simply the finest grind in this area. The drinks and food, albeit limited, are great- definitely try the raspberry muffins.There is also plenty of table and bar seating and friendly chatter. With a relaxed atmosphere, good music, and free wifi, it's easy to forget what's just outside the panoramic windows. They're my local caffeine connection of choice, so I'm biased, but The Grind is one of the rare jewels in the roundabout crown and definitely worth a go. Cheers guys.",

A welcome addition to the Shoreditch scene \u00a0probably not the best on offer in the area (there is some serious competition) but competently done. Service was smooth and friendly. Grinding up a mix of hipsters and suits that suggests they will be here to stay .",
