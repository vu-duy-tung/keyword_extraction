I was more than eager to try out Indian food in London proper as I had heard so many good things about it. I thought to myself there was no way coming from a multicultural city like Toronto that I'd be able to find better Indian food overseas, but alas, I was wrong!We ordered several dishes to share, including Chana Masala, Saag Paneer and Vegetable Korma, plus the most monstrous portion of Naan ever. I'm not even kidding - the size of this naan eclipsed my own skull. I am still laughing about it six months later. Service was impeccable and friendly. Prices were reasonable. The flavour of the food was surreal - I was in a curry coma for the rest of the night!",

I booked in advance although as it turns out it wasn't too busy. The tables of four are set very closely next to each other, so when the waitress showed me my table, a vision of me and my friends laughing loudly and annoying the surrounding tables flashed into my head and I think that must have shown on my face, as she then suggested another table further down the back of the restaurant!The menu has a good range of dishes, including Uthappams (lentil 'pizzas') and the vegetable thali which was the star of our show. I ordered vegetable kurma as it sounded lovely with delicate spices and cashew nuts. It was perfectly nice, but not sensational and arrived at the table warm rather than hot. The remaining two of the party ordered aloo gobi and an aubergine and okra curry. I think we were all a little surprised by the portion sizes - they're small, probably perfect if you have a starter, but we had saved ourselves for the main. We could have done with a couple of extra dishes to share between us.  The breads were very good, one sort (can't remember what it was called) was a quite oily but very delicious.Our waiter was funny (intentionally) and the service was good. The wine was surprisingly nice. I don't know why that's surprising, but house wines can be touch and go I suppose.Only other thing to mention is that it was a bit bright in there. It could have done with some more flattering lighting, especially as I was there on my *ahem... number deleted* XXth \u00a0birthday!I think if you're in the area, you could do much worse that to stop here for a bite to eat, however we travelled in from outside London so perhaps Sagar was unfairly under pressure to perform.",

I went to the Hammersmith branch but they also have restaurants in Covent Garden and Tottenham Court Road. The simple d\u00e9cor belies the quality of the food, but the hard surfaces and generic prints do not create a great atmosphere. (murrayblake.files.wordpr\u2026)The food strays far from traditional British sub-continental fayre \u00a0a speciality is their lentil pizzas (\u00a35-7) of which they have 7 to choose from including tomato, coconut and masala. To drink, I opted for the salt lassi which was sharp and creamy, cut with cumin and a great compliment to the spicier parts of my dishes \u00a0my friends also had this and said it was as good as what they had sampled in India. The starters all seemed fairly standard except for something called Idli which is a rice dumpling. My onion bhajis were crisp and fresh with crushed coriander seeds giving them a beautifully flat spiciness; they were softened by a light and creamy coconut sauce. (murrayblake.files.wordpr\u2026)I sampled both the north and south Indian Thalis, which both come with rice and bread: the highlight of the south was a sharp, hot and dry potato and mustard seed curry. The north Indian Thali had some slightly more familiar dishes \u00a0chana masala (chickpea curry) , spiced cauliflowers (aloo ghobi), paneer and vegetable kurma \u00a0these were all well cooked with a nice crunch still remaining in the vegetables. The Thalis included a wonderfully sweet and sticky Gulab Jammun for dessert.

The Percy Street restaurant is nice enough to have business lunches, friend lunches and dates in but it feels down to earth at the same time. They do really good weekday lunch deals and the staff will happily explain what things are on the menu. If in doubt try the mini thali, which has an array of dishes for you to test, but make sure you get a dosa too - a crispy lentil pancake stuffed with potato, paneer or various other things. I think Sagar is brilliant, and both sets of friends I dragged along with me recently agree. It was only as I was paying the bill the last time and making idle chit chat that I discovered they have a whole separate vegan menu - I am asking for that next time!",

Not friendly but food came out quickly.Food - delicious. Highly recommend the masala dosa, the thali, the bindhi. The salad was a bit dry and not super fresh though.Overall - prices are pretty good...we'll definitely return when in the mood for a dosa!",

My friend who is vegetarian wanted to take us to a local spot she loved.Masala DosaRice & lentil golden pancake filled with potato, onions & carrotI was intrigued on why my friend kept telling me to order the dosa! I've never seen it in the States before, so I was eager to try it. The dosa was crispy and was a delicious platter for the sambar and coconut chutney (included with the meal). BhajiaChopped onions dipped in light batter of gram flour, rice coriander seeds and fried them to give the extra munchMy friend really enjoyed this with her garlic rice.

    "text": "Right at the start, let me make it clear that there are some things that Sagar is brilliant for and some are just not as good as the originals.Sagar is a very famous chain in South India and Bombay for amazing South Indian / Udupi style vegetarian cuisine - this includes dosas, idlis, vadas etc.This Sagar is not a part of that chain, but they say that their chefs are from Udupi and that cuisine is their specialtyConversely, from my experience, the North Indian style food was extremely good and the Udupi cuisine was middling.Can't wait to be home in a week and eat 6 feet long butterpaper thin crispy dosas for less than 2 pounds.I wanted to take away some Vegetarian Indian food, which was why I had come here, but when I saw the dosas on the menu, I could not resist. I gave my takeaway order and asked for a paper masala dosa to eat in.Problems:1. The dosa was clumpy. Part of the dosa was thin and some parts were just too soft and thick.2. The dosa was half cold by the time it arrived at my table.3. The masala that was served separately had something marginally off - it definitely wasn't fresh and seemed to be reheated from the refrigerator after a couple of days. Traditional Udupi masala would have only potatoes. This was a mish mash of carrots, peas, potatoes and paneer.4. The chutneys (I asked for the extra red chutney) were served cold from the fridge. Ideally they should be served at around 24C temperature.5, The sambhar wasn't piping hot, it was lukewarm. And note that this is Udupi style slightly sweetish sambhar, not the fiery Tamilian sambhar, so it desperately needs that boiling temperature.If I had just eaten the dosa here, I would have rated this place a 1 or a 2, Why then the high rating of 4? Its for their North Indian food.The Channa bhatura was the best I have eaten in London. If bhaturas (fried bread made from white flour) is too heavy for you, just order the channa (chickpea) masala with parathas, it is outstanding!The aloo gobhi masala (potato & cauliflower) was amazing and the little bit leftover, kept well for a week in the fridge.The dahi vada (fried lentil balls soaked in yoghurt) was also very good.The parathas were almost home madeBut the absolute cherry on the icing of the cake was the gajar ka halwa (carrot dessert)The dosa was a major disappointment, but I'd go back for the North Indian food any day.Strangely for a so called Udupi restaurant, they have a full bar. Wonder what the purists would think about that. LOL",

We explained the hurry to the manager and he was very accommodating. We didn't even want to look at the menu and asked him to just bring us a combination of chaats and dosas. Despite the restaurant already being full, the food came out within a few minutes and he had ordered the right amount of food as well. Even bringing the check and credit card machine for payment was prompt. Really pleased we chose this spot.",

    "text": "Sagar serves PROPER Indian food, none of that take-away rubbish!It's fully vegetarian and have a whole separate menu for vegans, I was spoilt for choice!I started with Medu Vada (lentil doughnuts) which were cooked to perfection! You get two medium sized ones and after finishing them I sort-of regretted getting a starter as they were quite filling...especially when I saw the size of my main dish (it was then that my dad, who'd picked the restaurant, informed me that he'd heard they have \"generous portions\").I had a Masala Dosa for my main, and it was so big that it didn't fit on the plate! It was luke warm when it arrived so was cold by the time I got around to finishing it all. I guess I either need to eat faster or they need to make sure the food is a bit hotter. It wasn't spicy at all so I recommend a Masala Dosa if you're not used to Indian food.The service was good although not as friendly as other places. I'm guessing they're not used to having goths in there! Either that or they overheard my dad's constant complaints that there was no meat! (He was the one who chose the place and he knew it was vegetarian!).They have toilets downstairs, which were immaculate. I don't know if they have any accessible toilets at this venue so it might be worth asking before you visit if you have mobility issues.They have three venues in London and I wouldn't hesitate to visit any of them; the food was wonderful, definitely generous portions and very reasonably priced. Great authentic Southern Indian food :)",

Anytime we needed something - from ordering, to getting napkins, to getting the bill, we had to get up, walk over to the staff - milling around the bar - and ask for it.

Overall, I feel bad not giving them a better rating, given their great lassi and gulab jamun, but \"Meh. I've experienced better\" accurately sums up my sentiments, so I'm going to have to go with 2 stars, even though I sense that I may have just had an off experience.
