When I told them I wanted the special and wanted different osyters, they said its' only one type of oysters for the special. So i ordered 10 and it was fresh and delicious. I think the waiter was kind of looking at me cheap as that's all i ordered. But when I gave him a big tipe, he was all smiles and helpful with my questions about the area and where to shop. I don't blame him. I would not come back here as the prices are just too much.",

The service was excellent and fast. I had a glass of white wine, M\u00e2con Solutr\u00e9. Fruity sweet flavoured wine, definitely goes great with the fish. In term of oysters, I had Sp\u00e9cial de Claire and Brownsea Island. They were both great, but from these two I would suggest the Sp\u00e9cial de Claire with lemon on top. As house staples, my friend and I tried Smoked mackerel p\u00e2t\u00e9 and Cornish crab. They were both great. I would suggest the Cornish crab as it's more subtle. From the specials main, I had the Whole Grilled Plaice pancetta, sage and capers. It was amazing. Tender taste with amazing flavour. Great!My friend had Red wine braised cuttlefish with scallops and White beans. It was tasty and filling. For desert we had chocolate pot & hazelnuts, and a caramel cream. I definitely suggest the caramel cream. The bill was \u00a391 without service. A great evening and great company.",

So it is hard to figure out a strategy for ordering. \u00a0And if you don't like fish and seafood do not bother--I don't think there was a non-seafood offer except the side green salad, potato and veg of the day!The service could have been better . \u00a0We were at the counter and felt a bit neglected. \u00a0However, if you like Oysters, a place not to be missed.",

It's nice to see these Borough Market darlings branch out across the Thames too. Service during my lunchtime visit at the bar was efficient and a lot friendlier than I've come to expect at most London eateries. When you go, if they've got Kumamoto oysters order them! Id never had these slightly sweet and delicately flavourful morsels before, but after trying a lovely starter course of them here, I'd definitely be up for slurping 'em down again \u00a0and soon. I also really enjoyed my main course of chalkboard special Cornish squid with butter beans, chorizo and aioli (\u00a311) either. However, with options including whole Dorset crab (\u00a312.50), ox cheek, ale and oyster pie (\u00a316.50) and an enticing range of oysters, it might be awhile before resorting to those initial options.",

I prefer the Scottish ones because they are bigger and creamier. \u00a0The mussels are very tender and nicely cooked in the white wine source. They are delicious. The fish, I shall say, is done brilliantly. The only thing I hope they can improve is that there's little choice on vegetables that go with the seafood. Quite monotonous. Apart from that, Wright Brother is really worth visiting.",

    "text": "For photos see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  The new Wright Brothers Soho is certainly a fun place to gather the troops, or dine solo, for seafood binges large and small. Our Sunday night party of 6 gathered in the downstairs bar to share some champagne and oysters. I love the fit out of the bar area - high table seating, white tiles and exposed brickwork, industrial fittings, high ceilings and an open kitchen set the scene for a potentially buzzing area once the crowds start flocking in. It would also be the perfect place to eat alone at the bar while watching your oysters being shucked. Most of the searfood is sourced from Small Cornish day boats and is fresh and from sustainable stocks. The shellfish hails from Wright Brothers' own Duchy Oyster Farm on the Helford River in Cornwall, or other parts of Britain and France. Mmm... oysters - the ultimate creamy, salty taste of luxury. We ordered 2 dozen - a mixture of everything including the special Japanese Kumamotos, Carlingfords, Duchy Natives, Colchesters, Speciales de Claire and Maldons. All were good, but I particularly liked the buttery Carlingfords and the small, briny Kumamotos. Deep-fried whitebait with tartare sauce were slightly overseasoned but the delicate, crisp batter gave way to fresh, steamy moist flesh. Tiny Falmouth Bay prawns in garlic and butter are sweetly addictive and a large slab of toast lathered in a generous serving of fresh crab was also lovely and big in flavour. Service was friendly but a little slow - I had the feeling they didn't want to disturb our conversation which meant we found it difficult to get the food coming. But, it's still early days. Prices range from around \u00a36-7 pounds for 3 oysters and the small tasting plates are generally around \u00a34-9 each. Larger dishes like fish pie (\u00a314.50) and ox cheek, ale and oyster pie (\u00a318.50) are there for more substantive bites. I say it's very reasonably priced. The dessert menu is also appealing (including lemon sorbet from Gelupo, chocolate pot and hazlenuts or Neals Yard cheese). However, we outstayed the bar's shorter opening hours on Sunday (I think it closed at about 11pm), so we hit Bar Italia (it's been years, YEARS!) for panettone and fab hot chocolates. The upstairs restaurant at Wright Brothers Soho is also gorgeous - a slightly more romantic setting with candlelight and large windows overlooking Kingly Street. I already liked the original Borough branch, and now the Soho venue is a place to which I'll definitely be returning on a regular basis - for a more substantial meal next time, and then again when the need for reasonably priced oysters and bubbly after a hard days shopping takes hold.",

    "text": "Last Saturday night saw us seeking a tasty supper in Soho after a late afternoon braving the madness of Oxford Street and Selfridges department store in particular (note to self: never again venture into Oxford Street other than at 10am on a mid-week morning). As big fans of the Borough Market branch of the growing Wright Brothers empire this new central London restaurant had been on our must visit list for a while and the prospect of a plate of creamy, salty oysters soon raised our flagging spirits. The Soho branch is very much the grown up big brother to the much smaller and intimate original venture in Borough. There are two large more formal dining rooms on the ground floor with a more casual bar and dining area in the basement which has a fine view of the bustling open kitchen. My choice would be for the basement area where you will be sitting on stools at the high, long tables right at the heart of the action. Despite the pretty steep prices this is not stuffy fine dining; the staff are friendly, the specials of the day are chalked up on a blackboard and the vibe is what you would expect from an industrial type space in the heart of Soho. No trip to Wrights would be complete without some oysters and we ordered 3 speciales de claires and 3 oysters dressed with apple, shallot and cider vinegar. Beautifully presented they all slipped down a treat \u00a0a great way to start any meal. We teamed the oysters up with a 460ml flask of a very nice Albarino Igrexario \u00a0a lot of the wines on the wine list are available as 460ml flasks which is helpful if you don't want to break the bank (the bog standard, very ordinary house white is \u00a322 a bottle). Despite being a Saturday night we were under no pressure to move the meal along quickly so we waited until after our oysters to decide on our mains. A good idea as the oysters had perked up our appetites and we decided to share a starter portion of delicious moules mariniere before moving onto the plaice with pancetta, sage and capers for me and the pork belly with clams and salsa verde for B. Sides are not included with main dishes so we added on a portion of firm, creamy new potatoes which we shared. Given the growing tendency of many restaurants to charge for bread it's worth noting that at Wrights you will be provided with an excellent selection of two or three types of loaf and a generous portion of lovely butter. Bread and butter will be replenished upon request \u00a0essential if you want to enjoy every last bit of the sauce with your moules mariniere! Desserts never seem quite the thing at Wrights and this visit was no exception. The bill was by no means a bargain but seemed a far price to pay for this quality of food in central London. The Borough branch remains my favourite but I have no doubt that we will be dropping in again before too long.",

We went for a platter as there were 5 of us eating. We worked our way through prawns, razor clams, mussels, winkles, oysters (of course). The platter itself was good, but with the flavours reliant on the sauces we had to also order a lobster salad. The lobster salad intrigued us with its pairing with papaya and foie gras. The flavour was quite a disappointment - far too sweet and not complimenting the lobster flesh whatsoever. The papaya was more like green mango and there were seeds randomly added in - it did not work.The main I ordered the roast cod - it came with samphires, mushrooms and truffle oil. The sauce was creamy and rich and the flakiness of the cod was lost in this sauce. The wine was good - Australian pinot noir, but I wanted more flavour from the dishes cooked rather than remembering the wine.I will be back...for the \u00a31 oysters and maybe the platter. Join me for a happy hour of oysters? ;)",

The staff were very good at helping with selections. I had the soft shell crab for my main and it was perfect. Added a goats cheese salad which was out of this world (amazing dressing and cool 'greens'). Will go back for another date night.",

    "text": "We had walked in the area a while ago but didn't have the time to stop for some oysters. But this time we decided to stop by. And this was an excellent decision. The place itself is very cosy and friendly, hidden in a small court next to Carnaby street. There's two main areas, next to the small court with high tables and on the street side with regular table. And a huge terrace outside. Pick your preferred one. We loved staying on the high tables. As for food: I'd just go for the oysters. Lots of choices, delicious and fresh. They even have their own production which we found very nice also. Of course we tried other items of the menu, one or two were average (the ceviche) of hers were excellent (the king crab, the salmon, etc. )All this combined with a good choice of drink. Service is also friendly and efficient. So all in all a great place to go for seafood in London :-)",

    "text": "On my quest to find the best oysters in London I had to visit Wright Brothers. I got there around opening time so there was not an electric feeling to the place, other than their funky light bulbs. That said, I was greeted promptly and educated on the differences of their oyster offerings. They were all great but I think the best thing about this place was that they turned me on to using the green Tabasco sauce to spice up my oysters. Now I probably live a 4 hour drive from where they make that stuff and I had to come to London to learn about it. But thank god I did. Me and the wife are thinking of packing a bottle in her purse every time we go out to a local place at home in Texas. A little lemon and green Tabasco will top horseradish and cocktail sauce any day. Their presentation here is also very thoughtful. Each type of oyster we ordered was marked with its name on a oyster shell tucked above it. Like true tourists, we nabbed them all and took them home so we can frame them in a shadow box as an ode to our love of oysters. Scuse' the pun, but Wright Brothers is flying high in our book. Would definitely visit again on our next trip across the pond.",

We decided to get half a dozen special Dutch oysters, \u00a0some cucumber oysters and wasabi oysters. My wife and I have an annual ritual of going to our favorite oyster bar in Paris every time we travel to Paris, so you can say we are big oyster fans. We found the Dutch oysters to be ok, in comparsion with the French. However what surprised us were the wasabi flavored oysters. Interesting and quite tasty. While we prefer the old school way of eating, it was refreshing to try something new. We ordered some mussels and snails, which wasnt bad but we still prefer the French way of cooking. We ordered a fish for the main dish and decided to share. The outside was done nicely, however once we de-boned it ourselves, we found the center to be completely undercooked. We brought this to the restaurant staff and she was quicked to handle it. About 10~15 minutes later, a new fish was brought out and it was done perfectly. Great attentive service and quick to take care of the issue. The seafood was good and I would consider going back when Im in the area.",

Prices were reasonable for Soho and seafood.We had a variety of dishes not all I can remember as it was a while ago but we particularly enjoyed the Mussels and Spanish Fish Stew.I often reccomend this place for good food, with resonable prices and great service...",

I then asked the waiter to talk me through the different types. The waiter explained them and we definitely selected a good one! I recommend going for a dozen and choose a few types on one platter so that you can taste the difference.I like the bar area a lot, as also - if you sit there fast service is guaranteed. We sat at the area upstairs so the service was slower which would've been unfortunate, but fortunately we weren't in a rush!My dad and I ordered a sea bass to share - don't be fooled - the seabass portion served there is huge! Definitely a main course for two! And it also very simply cooked - lemon and rosemary, so the main thing you taste - is really just fresh fish!",

For the main, I had the whole sea bass and my wife had the cod, both were picked clean. To top it off, they have a great beer and wine selection. Service was friendly and attentive without lording over us and the restaurant has great ambience.It isn't cheap, but fairly standard for this level of food in London. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner on my recent trip to London. It was one of the highlighted meals of this trip. Remember when I went to Paris several years ago after graduate school, I didn't spurge on the seafood plater deluxe that time. So I didn't ended up trying the French crab (aka brown crab). With much regrets I was determined to get this brown crab baby into our stomach this time around. There are a few Wright brothers in London, not every location offers this plater. For instance, the one at the borough market doesn't. Tip* you have to make a reservation and leave a phone number so they can call you. If you are like me... didn't have a local phone that they can reach you, leave the number of your hotel, or promise to show up on time and actually show up on time. I wanted to thank the manager - Danny. He was very nice and helpful to us. Without this help we won't be able to get a table for two on Saturday night-- booking the night before. Thank you! We came here for the seafood -- the seafood deluxe was our target. Everything was soooo yummy. The tiny snails, tiny sweet shrimps that you don't have to peel, oysters, clams, mussels, LANGOUSTINE, and THE BROWN CRAB. It was messy to eat it but it was so worth it. First of all for the price -- it was a no brainer. I've never seen a seafood plater this affordable in NYC. I am sure you can get this if you are willing to pay a lot for it. Boy, I can eat the crab all by myself and die happy. Too bad I can't eat another one because I would if I could put down more food. We also ordered a bunch of other stuff. They were good but since I was so full after the seafood plater, they weren't as memorable to me. I think we got sushi/sashimi with ponzu, grilled Argentinian prawns, and beet root salad. If I were to stay for one more day, I would go back again for the crab. The one star was taken out because our waitress was not attentive. We had to flag her down and waited for her for a long time to fill our water glasses.",

    "text": "Tip: Go during Oyster Happy Hour, when select oysters are \u00a31. Got 2 dozen Lindisfarne, which were some of the best I have ever had. They are quite meaty and not too brine-y, which is just the way I like them. They are served with small diced onions in vinegar and lemon wedges as well as Tabasco sauce. We also got a House Platter, which we asked for without oysters, so it came with whelks, mussels, clams, and shell-on prawns. The clams were too salty for my taste, but the the rest of the selection was amazing. The platter was served with some mayo-based sauce and a lemon wedge. As recommended by our waiter, we also got a few small plates to share to complement our raw bar selection. The yellowfin tuna takaki was too thinly sliced for my taste, and the tempura fried rye bay squid was a bit doughy although very well fried. Service was great, especially since we went early and were situated conveniently by their convergence point.While the meal did make a non-trivial hole in the wallet, I thought it was reasonable given the location and quality of food. Will definitely return once my bank account recovers!",

    "text": "My friend Laura and I regularly meet up for something to eat. This time it was the turn of Wright Brothers in Soho to feed us before we headed off to Trafalgar Studios to see The Grinning Man.Wright Brothers is a small London chain of seafood restaurants with 5 locations around the city; Soho, Borough Market, Spitalfields, Battersea and South Kensington. We went to the Soho branch as it was closest to the theatre. It's located on Kingly Street which runs adjacent to Carnaby Street and even has an entrance there too. A fantastic location, I think you would agree.We usually go to places that have great meat or high end dining restaurants but Laura fancied a change and requested \"fish\" instead so after a bit of research we chose Wright Brothers. I had a look at the menu before booking and they had a broad selection of dishes to choose from. I also noticed that they offered seafood platters. I'd never had one before and I've wanted one for a long time so that's what we went for!I arrived a little before Laura and was shown to a rather small table next to the Kingly Street entrance (which became an issue later!) by a very friendly and chatty server. I take the liberty of ordering a cocktail for Laura and I and decide on a fresh number called a Jasmine Bloom. It contained gin, jasmine syrup, cucumber and soda and was a perfect start to the evening.As I had mentioned, there was only one thing on the menu I wanted to order. Luckily, Laura was more than happy to go along with it. We got the Full House platter which our server assured us was enough for 2 people. Laura ordered some broccoli tempura to accompany the platter. I'll be honest, I ate most of the tempura - it was delicious but the batter was a bit on the thick side.I ordered some wine to go with the food. They had plenty to go for but as we were eating shellfish I went for a white. I chose a Riesling as I wanted something nice and dry with light fruitiness to compliment the shellfish. This one was a winner. Made by Ernst Loosen at Villa Wolf in the Pfalz region of Germany. I highly recommend this combination. Wright Brothers sell this by the glass, 500ml or full 750ml bottle.We saw the seafood platter approaching from across the room. It was huge! This was going to be a problem. Did I mention that the table was rather small? The server put a trivet on the table to raise the platter about 6-9 inches off the table. This only helped so much as we already had a plate each, a basket of bread, glasses for water, cocktails and wine, the broccoli tempura and bowls for the empty shells. The table got VERY crowded, very quickly.The seafood platter itself was epic. Here's a list of what was on it.OystersRazer clamsShell on prawnsMusselsLangoustineClamsWhelksA whole crabShrimpI can confirm that it was all absolutely stunningly delicious (except for the whelks; we were not a fan because they're quite strong in flavour and chewy). The seafood platter was served, as is traditional, cold over ice with aioli and a shallot vinaigrette. I'd never tried oysters before this and I was pleasantly surprised. They weren't as slimy as I'd been told they would be. They were as salty, but that's what Tabasco and shallot vinaigrette is for! I will say that my favourites on the platter were the shell on prawns and the crab which were incredibly succulent and moreish. We left q fair few of the shrimps because they were really small and fiddly to de-shell.That was a lot of food for 2 people and we did our best. We were, however, defeated in the end.We'll be returning to Wright Brothers at some point. I might take my wife as she would definitely find something to eat on the menu even with her discerning taste. We probably wouldn't have the seafood platter again as it was A LOT of food. I felt that even though we ate a lot, we also wasted a fair amount which we ended up paying for.",

After the meal, we were told that they do oyster happy hours 3-5pm every day for \u00a31 per oyster, so try to aim for that. My king prawn was good, though also overpriced for the quantity, I would say. Service was generally good and prompt. We sat outdoors as it was a sunny day and really enjoyed the experience. Would recommend it if the weather permits. All in all, a great seafood place, but do be warned about the prices!",

She's white, blonde with huge eyes, I don't know her name cause they don't wear name tags. She didn't even pay attention when I'm ordering, cause I'm only ordering one extra dish. Then, of course, the wrong thing came up and I told her colleagues. She was very rude and claimed that she did not make any mistake in taking the order loudly, and claimed that I gave the wrong order. Well. So. Why would I order something I don't even eat?She then came back to me and reconfirm the order twice, to be honest, I don't feel comfortable with her intonations and facial expressions, that seems like I blamed her of something I was wrong about, when she's the one making mistakes and paying attention during work.I seldom give out low grades but that's why I'm giving the low low low grade for this wonderful restaurant. I would love to give a 5 stars, but her staff really disappointed me so much.",

    "text": "I used to love this place so much, I would travel here from Canary Wharf where I stayed for work once or twice a week to have a dinner. Then there was a 2 year gap in my travels, so you cannot imagine the excitement I had when I came back to London for a week. I circled around this place 3 times, but in the week between Christmas and New Year it was closed. So we decided to book a table for the actual New Years celebration dinner - the only time slot available was 22:30, so we took it. From the moment we got in everything went wrong. It took them about 15 minutes to find us a table and seat us and when the waitress came the first thing she said is that kitchen closes at 23:00. Quite a disappointment I must say, considering there was no warning when we made the reservation. When I looked at the menu I realized the raw seafood selection was cut in half, now featuring just some oysters, clams and shrimp - stuff you can get anywhere. The management or the chef must have changed, because the menu now is also not exciting. Nothing really to catch your eye. So we ordered a seafood platter which was ok. They were out of two dishes we picked as entrees so we settled on something else instead. Both were meh, lacking flavor or any interesting notes. My fiance's dish was overly greasy and bathed in some awful sauce. The restaurant was pretty empty by 23:30, so I asked if there was anything special for New Years and the answer was no. We asked for the check then trying to get out of the place - and it took our waitress half an hour to bring it! I had to re-ask twice, just to make sure we leave on time. Then we were just sitting there killing our time and I was ready to leave and come back to pay later, because the last thing I wanted is to celebrate inside of an empty restaurant. 5 minutes before midnight she finally re-appeared, but the night was ruined. We rushed to the street just to hear hurrays from every corner. On top of this unfortunate experience this was the most expensive dinner we had in London - quite a price for a below average food, slow impersonal service and an overall miserable night.",
