Each time we've gone, the bf and I have Alhambra beers, some patatas bravas ( the best I've had, and the aioli is ridiculously good), cured tuna with pear and pan de pincel (grilled crusty bread with olive oil, lavender and salt). It's not the cheapest in the world, but it's no more than my local Spanish place in Brighton, and this is better by far, so I'm happy. Each time we've been, we've had friendly and accommodating service too, and that goes a long way. Definitely a fan.",

And those certain things include lovely Spanish exports like proper Jamon Iberico and all the other delicious goodies at Jose Pizarro's West London outpost. However, as card-flecxing blowouts go, the simple joys of sliced acorn-fed pigs, so-cold-it-hurts sherry, cheeses, anchovies - the smoked ones, oh god the smoked ones - etc., is as good as it gets - particularly in this still oddly barren area. A lovely vibe, charming service and, if you sit in the little bit downstairs, you can watch the amazing sight of just four or five chefs preparing exemplary tapas dishes for 80+ covers.

Give it a go ... its exquisite.The Casa Brindisa is based in the street between the tube station and the museums, so if the V&A \u00a0isn't you thing, maybe the Science Museum will do the trick. Anyway, when you walk into this busy tapas place you have the option to either sit down at a table or at the marble bar counter. So far I've always chosen the counter as you can watch the mostly Spanish water prepare drinks and cut the meat. The menu on the counter is reduced to tapas, but I never found that a problem. Share some goats cheese in honey, or some thinly sliced cured meat or the toasted bread with garlic butter ... maybe not, if you want to go out into public after it. The wine list is extensive and ranges from glasses of house wine at around \u00a34 up to much more expensive bottles. So far I liked all the ones I tried. It's not a cheap place, but I really enjoyed the atmosphere every time I went and both drinks and food are amazing.",

We had a reservation for 8:45, arrived about 5 minutes late, waited at the front for a few minutes for some kind of service. A woman finally comes up and said \"oh we couldn't hold your table that long, there may be something in 20 minutes\". And then she ran off. That long?? We were barely late, and they had clearly seated someone way ahead of us since we were ungreeted for so long. When she walked away it was 8:54. For a place that seems to prefer reservations you think we could get a little slack, but not the case here, so be aware if you have a reservation. I doubt I'll make an attempt to go back with so many other options, but the chorizo/iberico(?) they were slicing in the front looked tasty.",

They were all oily in a good way, and described on the menu in an even better way - with tempting descriptions of each dish emphasizing the spanish ingredients.Here in South Kensington I think the white tablecloth ambience, the fancy-pants dishes and the high-ish prices are what seems to work, attracting the rich local set and the tourist hordes in numbers. Museum and university staff can hardly afford to lunch on Jamon Iberica every day can they? Until they can (hint-hint... more credit card please), I don't think I'll be rushing back.",

My husband and I had pretty much discounted Spanish food when we stopped eating meat because negotiating the menu was like walking through a minefield of cured meats. But the menu here is surprisingly diverse and we were spoiled for choice. When the food arrived, it was all lovely, plentiful, and surprisingly affordable for the neighbourhood.

The quality of their ingredients were on point, but the taste just didn't do it for me. When I hear Spanish tapas, I envision vibrant food. Didn't really get that here.I ordered the Perol de Cordero (lamb), Chorizo de Le\u00f3n (chorizo on toast), and the Bacalao en Tempura y Miel de Trufa (cod). The cod was decent. A very delicate fish with a subtle honey. The chorizo was delicious and very rich and the toast I had was crispy. My friend's toast was slightly burned and you could get that burnt taste which wasn't too pleasant. The lamb was the best. I had one that was juicy and delicious. The other was on the dryer side (they probably cooked these around the same time but the size difference caused the dryness).All in all, a decent meal but I don't think it warrants the high price.",

    "text": "Good selection of wine and tapas, this casual restaurant didn't disappoint. We stopped in for lunch on the weekend and were able to grab a seat at the small bar. It was very busy otherwise. The tapas were interesting and mostly true to the originals in Spain. We had croquetas, gazpacho, piquillos rellenos, alb\u00f3ndigas, and catalan spinach. Everything was very good, fresh, flavorful, and well prepared. We were surprised that the spinach was not completely wilted (cooked down) but enjoyed it due to it being nicely dressed. The wine list was interesting and had several good options to choose from.",

    "text": "I found Casa Brindisa to be a little hit and miss, both in the food they serve and the service staff. The Tortilla was filled to the brim but a little lack-lustre in taste, the cured Catalan sausage was seasoned well (like salami but with a more gentle taste), the croquetas were delightfully crunchy on the exterior with a warm and tasty interior, the grilled octopus may be an acquired taste, the lamb cutlets were good and well matched with the bed of vegetable and chickpeas, whilst I found the duck to be a bit tougher and bloody than I would like.One male member of staff was attentive and courteous whilst another female member of staff took a wrong dessert order and dropped items.Overall, the restaurant is conveniently placed, often packed with tourists, and a little hectic whilst the food served is somewhat curious but interesting to try out.",

    "text": "We went for dinner after seeing an exhibition at the Natural History Museum. We ordered four dishes: prawns in garlic sauce, pork steak, octopus with mashed potatoes, and ham and chorizo croquettes. All four dishes were flavourful and solid. I particularly liked the prawns in garlic sauce; I recommend ordering a side of bread to dip it and enjoy it with the garlic sauce. All other dishes were also fresh, and we left having finished everything down to the last pieces.Ambience was good overall, though hard to say definitively as we were sat in a corner away from the heart of the restaurant. Nonetheless, when we first walked in, I thought the decor and most everything were reasonably sophisticated. Lastly, service was good and prompt. Our waiter came to take and serve our orders on time, and was kind overall. Would most definitely return if I'm in the area again. I heard their stall in Borough Market is also good!",

    "text": "We stopped by during an afternoon tea time for some small bites. I felt the service is quiet misleading, and they tend to add changes beyond the menu. When we looked at the menu at the entrance and the cured meat display looks attempting, we decide to come inside. Once seated, the receptionist asked us whether we want some olive when we are deciding on the menu. I particular told him that if \"it's just samples, sure.\" (w assuming it's complementary) So he served us a small bowl of the green olive (w orange) inside, which latter on appeared on our bill for full charge. we didn't argue because we did eat it, but it wasn't clear at the beginning.I ordered a grilled octopus leg w mash potato and jarred chicken liver w tossed bread. Octopus is quiet tasty, like other reviews says, but it took a while, which was a little disappointing because we told them that we are on the go, and our waiter didn't warn us about what dishes are quick or not. Chicken liver is not bad, but the tossed bread is as hard as rocks. we have to ask for regular bread to eat w the chicken liver paste, and later on told the waitress that it was very hard (not just crunchy). She said I am sorry, and it's the way it's made. When we got our bills, bread was extra 2 pounds, and 12.5% gratitude was added automatically, even though we didn't enjoy our service at all. it's quiet a disappointing dining experience.",

    "text": "I don't find myself going for Spanish food particularly often, possibly because I've never been to Spain so I have no idea if it's really authentic in London (that's a mini Portlandia reference....), but I also just associate it with queuing and spending more than I intended it. \u00a0Maybe I'm just being a cynical old bastard (I do have a lot of white hairs it must be said) so you can probably ignore this entire paragraph.Anyway, in four years of being a student at Imperial, I finally got round to trying here after I'd finished (I know right?) \u00a0Luckily at 8:30 on a Tuesday there was room, although it was fairly busy. \u00a0The space is exactly what you might expect, although I found it a bit on the echo-y side so I had a little trouble hearing people (I'm terrible at distinguishing voices in high-noise places); the staff were fine, although not the friendliest in the world - I'll go ahead and tip the \"functional\" box.We had:- charcuterie plate (chorizo, loin, ham) which, although omitting the Iberico ham (that's on the more expensive platter) was rather good,- manchego (with a tangy fruit jelly)...not my favourite cheese, but I liked the combination.- Gambas al ajillo (prawns in garlic butter), nom nom nom, garlic, butter, prawns, in a sizzling dish? \u00a0I stank all evening but it was totally worth it. \u00a0Plus everyone should smell like garlic all the time. \u00a0We had some grilled tomatoey bread to mop up the butter :)- grilled octopus leg, nicely charred on the outside, not overcooked, and the potatoes were perfect for putting in the prawn butter.- Bean stew with sausage and pork: a nice hearty winter dish, although it wasn't particularly inspiring. \u00a0Still, nice to have a bit of and reasonably filling.Not a lot of plates between three people, but fortunately I wasn't hugely hungry. \u00a0Still, it was a decent amount of food and came to just over \u00a320 a head. \u00a0It's fine, but on a different day I suspect I could easily drop another \u00a310. \u00a0That said, the portions are reasonably sized and it was as pricey as I expected. \u00a0All in all, I'd go back and recommend it if you're in the area. \u00a0My biggest gripe was the lack of a Mariachi band but I'll email the suggestion to them - hopefully they pick up on it.",

All the tapas style dishes came out pretty swiftly, and the Manchego was possibly one of the only highlights of the night. The rest was bland. Sorry, Casa Brindisa.",

The waitress was attentive and helpful when we had questions regarding the menu. I particularly really enjoyed the garlic prawns (gambas de ajillo) and octopus. Food (no wine) for three fairly big eaters was about \u00a375, so really not too bad, considering the area and the type of food (small plates always add up!). I wouldn't travel across town for it, but it is a convenient and tasty option in an otherwise rather touristy area.",
