    "text": "On The Bab recently opened their second branch in Covent Garden, brining their version of Korean street food closer to the heart of London.My favourite dish at On The Bab has to be the quail egg and bacon egg muffin, which is a Korean version of a muffin. I could have this for my breakfast or as a snack!Yangyum chicken are sweet, sticky and cripsy, which comes in three different portion size - small, medium and large . The small portion is good to share between two people which allows you room to try out the other dishes on the menu.The Pa Jeon was presented nicely but it was not as nice as those at other Korean restaurant in London. This was the same with the Bibimbab which is served with a choice of meat and we selected the bulgogi beef. I do recommend to add the sweet chilli sauce and mix all the ingredients together, otherwise you will find this dish bland. I would had prefer it to be warmer but then this is a good alternative to the sizzling version for the warmer season.Korimari consisted of 6 mini rice rolls with Korean style anchovy, sweet and chilli radish and cabbabge salad, with a choice of meat. The way to eat this dish is combining different components together and not separate. This was like a decomposed gimbap.On The Bab serves Korean version of the soft fluffy white bun with a choice of fillings (bulgogi beef, spicy pork, spicy chicken, fried chicken or mixed veg). We tried the Spicy Pork bun and although it was messy to eat, this was another nice dish. The only con was that I would had prefer the bun to be hot and not barley warm.Since the concept of On The Bab is a place to drink and eat, it can not be with out a range of drinks. You will find beers, shots, wine, alchoholic and non-alchoholic cocktails. There are also soft drinks including coke and juices. I ordered one of the Korean soft drink, rice punch which is served in a Mason jar look alike. Even a simple hot tea came in a tin cup with a lid. It reminded me of Jamie Oliver's rustic approach to serving food.Although I would not say all the dished we tried that evening was outstanding, but I do love the concept. It's casual and rustic which makes it a great place to catch up with friend.",

Staff are mostly Korean, not the best service in the world but that is to be expected in most Oriental fast food restaurants in London, due to the popularity and limited spaces, it is not easy to get a table in the evening and you can't really stay long, so this place is more ideal for a quick catch up with friends, expect to pay around 20 pound per person with a drink. They also do take away so it can be an ideal lunch time choice if you work nearby.",

However, not horrible, and if I didn't mind the lack of legitimate Korean food, I'd probably go back if it were just an issue of food. Service however, was a huge issue. Our waiter took our order, someone else delivered the food, and I had to flag down a third person for the cheque. Something I observed - another customer came in and was directed to sit at the bar. The bar's chairs are quite unsteady and the floor is slippery so he ended up falling to the ground. Not a single employee went to his aid. Everyone just watched and didn't care whether one of their customers was hurt. A nearby table got up to help him after a while. The person whom I think was the manager was present and in view, and also just observed the hurt customer. Several minutes passed before he went to check on him.",

    "text": "So, does the rapid spread of OnTheBab herald a rise in Korean street food? They're following in the trail blazed by Korean fast food chain Kimchee, which has brought affordable yummy Korean food to the high streetI stumbled upon this branch in Covent Garden and despite having eaten lunch, I felt it was my Yelp duty to try out the Korean fried chicken to further expand my 'Chicken Lickin' Yelp listThey were in a quiet spot between lunch and dinner services but I was served quickly and efficientlyAs mentioned, I went for yangyum chicken, the Korean version of fried chicken. They offer a choice of 4 sauces - sweet soy, sweet spicy, garlic mayo and seasoned onion. I went for the garlic mayoAs expected for a restaurant specialising in street food, they packaged my takeaway chicken well. When I opened up the box, I was surprised to find that the chicken was completely smothered in the sauce. The chicken was crispy but I couldn't taste the flavour because the garlic mayo was overwhelmingly garlicky. Now, I love garlic but this sauce is something else, so be warned. Perhaps they should serve it on the sideI have however seen enough encouraging signs to make a return to try more dishes",

We were really pleasantly surprised by this new discovery. Fortunately we got here before any queues had begun forming so we're seated pretty much straight away (there was a queue of at least 10ppl by the time we left). Our order was taken really quickly - great coz we were in a rush - and food came promptly after. I went for the bibimbap which was different to others I'd tried as the pot didn't come scorching hot like in other places. The vegetable was chucked in cold too - but I didn't mind this as the portions we huge and flavours great. In fact looking around the whole restaurant I noticed all the portions were quite big so thumbs up there! The bill came to an incredible \u00a324 - that's 2 mains and 2 soft drinks - cheap considering we're in Covent Garden here!Definitely will come here again!",

I mean you can just take three random people from the street and they will do a better job than these waiters/ waitresses who served us.No intuition whatsoever, it was like we had to explain we need spoons to drink a soup...They had a very low food hygiene rating from the FSA as well at the time but I see that they have now improved to 5 stars. It's good but I had it when it was less stars.I might go again as I love their kimchee soup but wouldn't be rushing.",

    "text": "My 1st experience of Korean food was last week. I went for On the bap because the menu was concise but interesting and honestly? Because I love fried chicken. I found the restaurant quiet for a lunchtime with a great industrial vibe and poppy Asian soundtrack.I started off with an aloe punch-nothing exciting there. Then I tried the fried chicken, I went for the soy ginger which turned out to be a glaze rather than dipping sauce. Very nice it was too. The chicken was super moist inside and tasty!Then came my Korean bulgogi beef burrito. A few things disappointed me about this dish. The roll was wrapped in seaweed and much drier than I thought. The beef didn't have much flavour and the veggies were too plain. However, I think I was won over once I ignored the fact it wasn't a burrito was I knew them. The roll was sliced into very slim slices, there were actually a lot of ingredients in the roll and with the side sauce, it was a very nice, crunchy and interesting dish. Service was on and off but actually, I would like to go back and try more dishes and definitely more fried chicken!!!",

    "text": "It's ok. Depends what you're after. The flavours are definitely there but it is a pretty full on, mayonnaise-y meal. It's hands down some of the best kimchi I have had in a very long time but that's probably the 'freshest' thing on the menu. They have a small broccoli salad which comes out in a small hipster jar and is pretty watery with a generous squirt of orange looking mayonnaise and some fried shallots on top. This particular mayonnaise features in a number of dishes so if mayo is not your thing then maybe this restaurant is not for you.The small bites to share are all ok. There is a fair bit of deep-fried throughout the menu options including all sorts of fried chicken. Dip it in orange mayonnaise. And actually the dip with the beer snacks is orange mayonnaise. You can also find it on the Pork buns which is probably the best orange mayonnaise matched dish. The burrito also has this sauce as your dipping option \u00a0and is actually not a burrito, rather it is a sushi roll with cabbage and the meat of your choice. There are dumplings; shrimp or chicken, and blow me down and call me nancy, they come out with orange mayonnaise. I haven't had the traditional dishes but I think, don't quote me, they come out orange mayonnaise free so maybe if I go back I will try one of these. They look super filling so if you get one maybe don't order too much more! So lots of flavour but lots of the same flavour throughout all of the dishes. Orange mayonnaise flavour. The service is verrrrrrryyyyyyyy slllloowwwwww. A lot of waiting staff standing around motionless whilst people at tables try to get their attention without any luck as they stare off into the distance or talk about weekend plans to other waiting staff. My first drink took 45mins and the beer snacks took 55. So, in summary, if you have a particular soft spot for orange mayonnaise JACKPOT you have found your ultimate restaurant.",

It felt like that scene out of Step-brothersOMG DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS - youtube.com/watch?v=3-ZU\u2026 We'd been talking via Twitter for ages so it felt only right that we meet in 'real life' for some food - and I quickly discovered we are basically like the same person. Our original dining spot backfired on us, so chose to head to On the Bab as Lauren had heard some promising reviews. It's a laid-back Korean street food restaurant just off the main square in Covent Garden.The menu is made up of lots of different dishes, from steamed buns and fried chicken to larger dishes with rice and kimchi. We did what food bloggers do best and ordered a number of dishes for the table to share between us starting with pan fried shrimp dumplings (\u00a33.90). We also ordered the spicy pork steamed buns (\u00a37). These were gorgeous! Little pillowy clouds of deliciousness and really generous portion sizes too.And finally Korean style kimchi bacon pae lla with a perfectly cooked fried e gg on top (\u00a38.50). This was my absolute favourite dish - so much flavour and with the right kick of spice.Overall we were really impressed with On the Bab. The food was delicious, the service was speedy and it was very wallet-friendly.All our food plus drinks came to just under \u00a315 each -which for Covent Garden was brilliant. I'd definitely recommend trying it out next time you're in the area.",

Potentially one of the best I've had around town, although I tend not to order bibimbap often when eating Korean. The atmosphere was nice and the staff were friendly. I will say, I ordered a sorjurita, their version of a frozen margarita, and I wasn't much impressed. It tastes great but cost \u00a36 for one cup that had three large ice cubes in it. I enjoyed the sour taste along side my Korean food though! Overall the experience was nice, but I would consider this an expensive meal.",

Here everything is a la carte unless you go with their equivalent to a bento box. This came with a choice of meat - spicy pork for me, with rice, bean sprouts, kimchi, coleslaw and a gyoza. It felt a bit fusion but whatever, it tasted good.My companion's bibimbap was just ok. The beef bulgogi was plain so have to top with a lot of hot sauce. Egg was slightly overcooked and would have been better in a hot stone bowl.The saving grace was the fried chicken with your choice of topping. We went with the soy ginger and peanuts. It was sweet and savory, delicious!I wouldn't queue for it but it's worth stopping in for some beer and chicken when in the area.",

Usually this come included with a main in places I've been. The main I had was bimbimbap. It was average and smallish. As soon as I got it I knew it wouldn't be satisfying. Also the service was slow and I do admit as a North American native it drives me nuts that a service charge is included if service is slow.

But I couldn't taste the kimchi or much flavor, which was disapointing. They were definitely overpriced. The table next to us ordered fried chicken and main dishes, which looked good compared to our tiny tiny small plates. I think next time, I'll come hungrier and not waste my money on the small dishes.

My friend mentioned that he felt there was too much cabbage when we were served it on a massive tray. \u00a0But I tend to like that they give a generous amount of cabbage. The sushi burrito roll is really filling and delicious too! Highly recommend this place to hangout for nibbles and drinks with friends just cos it's really easy to split and share.

    "text": "I really liked the buzzy, casual vibe of this place! We were lucky to wander in without a queue and waited only 5mins for a table, though the line built up quite quickly behind us.My mouth was watering when I saw the menu so we ordered a feast from just about every section. The spicy pork on the buns were nicely fat and well stuffed, and bulgogi beef on the bibimbab fresh and tasty. My highlight was the seasoned spring onion sauce on the yangyum chicken which had my tastebuds a-tingling like crazy! Lucky we'd ordered draught kirin to wash it all down - which if you order in sharing size actually arrives in a tower with a tap (cue everyone in the restaurant looking round to see who the beer guzzlers are) ;)I thought the staff were a bit abrupt at first but they turned out to be quite lovely - I think the first woman was just rushed off her feet but she later came to say a very genuine sorry at how long our beer was taking to arrive - the kind of thing you really don't mind if the service still makes you feel special so well played.A very reasonably priced and filling feed (though not ideal as we had to run to make our cinema showtime afterwards!). I'm sure I'll be back to try more of those addictive sauces on the KFC...",

I regret to say they stop serving us to dining in the restaurant although they have plenty of empty tables left. Unfortunately, we can only get take away. We get a few dishes to try which includes spicy octopus and prawn salad, \u00a0spicy rice cake and fish cake and spicy chicken on the bun. Foods are taste lovely but i hope the poor management need to be implemented.",

    "text": "I have been dying to try On the Bab, who advertise themselves as Korean street food, for ages and have all of their branches bookmarked on Yelp. After a few drinks my friend and I decided to pop in for some food imagining the service to be quick canteen style: tables with very fast service (Leon style but delicious Korean street food). It's actually more of a sit down affair. A very hot sit down at that! The tables in the main part of the restaurant were full however there were some at the front by the prep kitchen. We parked up to find they were uncomfortably stifling. The menu was brought to us instantly and then a friendly waitress was available to take our order soon after that. The food comes as it is ready and was good although nothing amazing. My friend ordered a bibimbap which was big and filling but at \u00a39.50 on the more pricey side of other bibimbaps we've had. I \u00a0couldn't decide what to go for so ordered two starters; Korean arancini and fried chicken salad, which came quickly resulting in a long wait for my friends food - the arancini was still piping hot after a long wait and the chicken is served cold to begin with (weird). Although both dishes were good the salad was not a salad but more of a cold vinegar soup with cabbage, carrot and fried chicken floating on top - bizarre! The arancini were good but a little blander than I had hoped. Drinks were expensive considering the size of the glass of wine and cocktails. Overall not a bad dinner but not the best I've had. I wouldn't be back in a hurry although saying that the buns they were serving were huge and looked incredible! No where near top of my list but also not bottom!",

    "text": "Can't fault the food from sticky, crispy chicken wings in a glorious sweet and spicy sauce; to a fine use of bacon in a kimchi and rice stew with an egg on top. Who doesn't like an egg on top? Maybe vegans, but this is not the place for them. With both of these comes a surprisingly scrumptious cabbage salad that I recommend drenching in the anonymous orange sauce that's on the table.The deduction in points is due to the service. At 5pm on a Sunday I couldn't understand why the only two times we saw a waiter, that wasn't delivering food, was when we'd caught their attention. Then there was the service charge, which I'm not fond of anyway when it's added to the bill against your own will. In this case it doesn't actually mention on the bill that it's optional/discretionary which means it's essentially it's a hidden charge. Rant over, I asked for it off and the polite waiter had no problem removing it.Pro tip: the seats at the window offer a good view for staring at the world. But as the inevitable queue builds up to get into the restaurant, so does their intrigue and before you know it you have an audience while you eat.",

We were lucky to get a table right away, so expect some waiting if you're here around lunch time. I had the baek ban with spicy pork. It comes with kimchi, coleslaw, bean sprouts and rice. Kimchi was perfect. The pork marinade was very sweet, of course they use alot of sugar, but it's absolutely a winner. You don't go for Korean if you're on a diet...Try the On the rice as well; meat in sushi rolls (no sushi, though). It's awesome. Their citrus sparkle drink is very good, too.Don't expect great service here, but the food makes up for it. Great place for lunch.",
