The people recognized us by name when we walked in, we were seated and served promptly, and everyone was extremely friendly. We had the fried pickles as a starter, I had the softshell crab burger, and my mom had the brisket. I still think about how amazing that food was. Next time I make it over to London, I am definitely going back.",

However if you're an American going here expecting true soul food or hearty BBQ, you will be disappointed. There is little to no spice in the food (although you can suplement with their broad array of hot sauces!) There are also things like Coney Island Hot Dogs on the menu. Fun for a night out for drinks and nosh, but not for those pining for true American cuisine.",

    "text": "I was looking for somewhere central that I could take my dog and my parents on a Thursday night. I wanted it to be fun & very London as my parents live in Aberdeen & I don't get to see them that often. I noticed some chat about the Fat Bear so emailed to see whether they would accommodate my group. They were very helpful in making sure my dog would be welcome and made a reservation for us so that we would be sure to get a table.On arrival we were welcomed warmly and were well looked after all evening. I noticed that the warmness extended throughout the room, not just to us. Great customer service is my favourite so this was very good!We shared some deep fried pickles and pimento cheese to begin. Both were very good. In fact the deep fried pickles are the best I've tried in London - hot, great tang and didn't seem greasy at all, which is a feat to achieve when you're talking about fried food! The dip we got with it was some sort of ranch or mayo based affair - I can't remember what it was, but I would have preferred a blue cheese dip because I am mad about blue cheese. That's personal preference though, others might have preferred what was given. Both were reasonable sized portions for the price.For my main I wanted to have the spinach salad with a side of chicken wings, but unfortunately they were out of wings, BOOOOOOOOO. It's not a huge menu, so this was a little disappointing. Still, these things happen. The salad was really super delicious, and nicely southern. I approve. At the table we also had the burger with stilton cheese & sweet potato fries (a resounding YES) and the mac and cheese with bacon. All were happily devoured.The Sun & 13 Cantons seems to be a good choice for the Fat Bear's pop up restaurant. The pub is split into the pub side and the restaurant side, so really they can both get on with what they need to be doing. As it's a separately operating pop up, you do have to order your drinks at the bar yourself, but this isn't a problem - the bar staff were super friendly & efficient despite the bar being rammed on a Thursday night.We all had a very nice time here & enjoyed the food a lot. I will definitely return once they get a permanent spot and look forward to seeing what the service, atmosphere and food is like there. Maybe they will even earn that fifth yelpy star (the chicken wings being good might just seal the deal).Thanks FB!",

    "text": "This is a pretty damn good restaurant, a proper representation of southern American cooking (not the cheap greasy stuff from fast food or the imitation 50s you get from 'diner' style restaurants).The staff are super friendly, the food tastes good and by god it's filling.We had starters and main, and the mains are the real stars of the show. (I'd suggest skipping the starters and saving room for the massive mains.)- Gator Bites where nothing special, sure you get the novelty or saying that you've eaten gater but the meat isn't particularly interesting and the pieces you get aren't hug.- Deep fried pickles were pretty fun but that's mostly because I love pickles anyway + the mayo was super tasty.- Grilled Red Snapper was very tasty, the sauce spicy and FULL of flavour. I can highly recommend it (though the fish was a little overdone on one side). Cajun spice is a win for me.- BBQ Brisket was absolutely brilliant. Full of flavour and just falling apart. The sauces were a delicious accompaniment, as were the very tasty slaw. My girlfriend couldn't finish the whole thing but that's ok because Fat Bear were more than happy to oblige us with a doggy bag (real U.S.A. style).I'm sure we'll go again, maybe with friends one time - it's a warm, comfort food experience.(My suggestion, make yourself a round of new Orleans milk punch at home after eating here, before you go to bed, delicious!)One thing to note is there isn't a massive variety of Veggy options, maybe 2 or 3, but if you have a high proportion of veggies with you, you probably shouldn't be taking them to a southern American restaurant.",

On to the biscuits and gravy which were a wonderfully savory english riff on the southern classic and the gumbo which had a good amount of spice that just warmed my American heart. Having recently moved over here from the states it was really a treat and just a great meal all around. I haven't seen too many places like this in London so far, and these guys are really doing it right.",

And believe it or not, the Fat Bear reached my expectations to the core. Not just the quantity of the food which never seemed to stop and was impossible to eat, but also the quality.  Our tables were bending over with food, just as out bellies were aching from overreaching our limits. As for starters, we got very delicious cheese spread, even better rabbit liver and some nice spicy chicken wings with garlic sauce. All these were followed by turkey, cheese macaroni, grilled veggies, rice, fish, some ham, meat cake, sweet potatoes and by some other three different plates which I could not try any more. \u00a0And what it would be for a feast without a dessert. My winner was the Oreo cheesecake, however I strongly recommend also the warm pumpkin pie. All in one, the food was delicious, just as the service and very familiar atmosphere, just as it should be during Thanksgiving. Do not hesitate and try it out, but don\u00b4t be surprised if you stuff yourself way too much. I have warned you :)",

    "text": "Having just come back from a long holiday around the US, I can safely say that this is the best American food I've eaten this side of the pond. It's not following the 'Americana' trend as many restaurants are - they're refining it using their British influence and the highest quality local produce. We tried the franks wings, mac and cheese with bacon, and fish tacos - all of which ere executed perfectly - particularly the mac and cheese which was the perfect combination of saucy and smokey. We will definitely return, and I'm very tempted by the \u00a330 tasting menu - the best value tasting menu I've seen anywhere in London!Looking forward to the main site to open next year. ALL HAIL THE FAT BEAR!",

    "text": "This is one of those tough reviews because it's probably a solid 4.5 stars, so do I round up or round down? Given the really great customer service, I'm gonna round it up.We came here for book group one night. My choice as we were reading \"The Commitments\" and I made the soul music/soul food link in my head. First we started with a cocktail, and I was really happy with mine. Everyone else seemed impressed with theirs as well. I liked how they had a mix of sweet and not-too-sweet cocktails as I prefer mine on the not-too-sweet spectrum of things.We started with a bunch of nibbles to share. We had the buffalo wings, the fried pickles, the spinach dip and the fried liver to start. I really couldn't fault the starters. The wings were tasty and the blue cheese dip was awesome. They maybe weren't traditional, but that's okay! The fried pickles were awesome. And those fried livers were really the best thing. Soft and delicious.For the main course, I had the brisket, but only because the chicken and waffles wasn't available. We also split the poutine, corn bread and beans on the side. The poutine was freaking amazing. I don't know if it's traditional, but that gravy was outstanding. The beans were incredibly good as well. The corn bread was the only disappointment of the sides as it was really dense. It had nice flavor, but the texture was all wrong. The brisket was good for London, but didn't compare to places you can get it in the US. I did really love the mustard barbeque sauce it was served with though. Dessert we split the pie of the month, and there were two: coconut cream and peanut butter. I was happy with both. I even had a bit of someone's sundae, and it was spectacular. I took some of the praline home, and I enjoyed it, but my partner thought it was too sweet. All in all the food and atmosphere (and cocktails) are great, and I would go back in a heartbeat. Maybe next time I'll plan on brunch.",

Food this good should be prohibited! Now I know why they suffer from obesity over there! If the food is this flavoursome then I don't blame them! I'll be joining the team! Anyhoo so I had the softshell crab burger for mains and the buffalo wings for starters ......, let me just say those were the tastiest buffalo wings in history! Someone should give that chef a medal dammit! And the crab burger was another trip to flavour town! Had the cheese cake and the sundae for dessert coz I'm a greedy little poppet haha ..... Jesus Christ it was mind blowing! \u00a0That cheese cake!! I need it for my future wedding cake point final! And the sundae had my eyes at the back of my head! To say the least we had a ball!

The Fat Bear has taken a 1 year residence above the Rising Sun pub and I hope it stays longer.The menu is a mash up of US (and Canada) favourites - apparently the chef is a Canadian with New Orleans roots. And it shows. The appetisers are superb. We had them all - deep fried pickles, wings, gator bites. Sweet chilli sauce with the gator isn't traditional but works well. The mains were also good. We had the shrimpJambalaya which looks great, the Southern fried chicken burger and Southern Fried Chicken as a main were both great. The crispy batter is excellent - I added the poutine to my main and so glad I did. The Gravy is a smoky delight. So good! No room for dessert sadly. Next time. Cocktails were very original and excellently presented. And picklebacks have to be tried - only way I will drink whiskey now! Go here and enjoy. Food,drink, service are all great.",

    "text": "Very cute place!After reading another yelper's review, I thought I must visit. I had previously not heard of or seen any other places in London claiming to serve authentic Cajun or REAL chicken and waffles, so it was immediately bookmarked. Upon walking in, the decor has a very New Orleans, speakeasy type vibe. Very cute date night spot, nice place to grab drinks after work, or to have a meal with a group of friends. Very friendly staff- found out later that it's family owned and operated. The only reason I've only given 4 stars is they had no chicken and waffles or ribs!!! The two dishes we wanted to order were not available. Very disappointing. The buffalo wings were good. Nothing to write home about, but I'm a harsh critic with wings having lived in Atlanta for years where all the original wing spots exist. According to UK standards, they are quite good. Jambalaya- 5 stars. Very flavourful and the two tiger prawns on top add a nice touch. My friend had the Coney Island hotdog and for her that was just a bit much. The chilli was impressive, but I wouldn't recommend unless you were really craving a hot dog specifically that day. The cocktails- great! We had the bartender, Brian, bring over an original drink from New Orleans on the house once we got settled at our table. Very impressive, very strong, and indeed, very New Orleans. He also made a lovely mocktail for my preggo friend and the mint rose daiquiri was just as described. Very fresh, very flavourful, just delicious. And the presentation is fantastic. 5 full stars for the cocktails. We decided we'd save dessert for our next visit, which we definitely will do soon to experience the chicken and waffles. All in all, I'd highly recommend visiting. Definitely for a great cocktail, great food, and an overall nice evening out.",

Dear god, since spending some time in Tennessee I have loved southern American food and the Fat Bear is nailing the awesomeness.Having been once with yelp to try the whole menu i recently returned with a friend for an off the cuff Friday night dinner.Wandering up the stairs from the pub below it still amazes me the cute surroundings of this speak easy styled restaurant. Welcomed by the manager despite being busy they found space for us at the bar.Beers ordered we looked over the menu. We were stuck with what to eat.....ribs, alligator bites, crab burger......chicken fried steak (I'll explain later).....it was a really tough call.The offer of being allowed ribs as a starter made life easier. Shared ribs, followed by the soft shell crab burger for me and the chicken fried steak (CFS) for my friend. Ribs.....dear god. That's all I have to say about that.What is CFS, well let me tell you my friend....they take a lovely ribeye steak....they tenderise it and they prepare it like they would feed fried chicken and serve it with their house gravy. OMFG.......this is heaven on a plateMy giant crab was juicy and amazing and awesome, on a fresh roll it was also epically good. Happy JD.All washed down with a couple of pickle backs this was a night to remember. I will be back......soon.....it's lunchtime soon....I might be back today.",

Considering how desolated the area is, this really speaks volume. The room has a cosy and intimate atmosphere to it. The blinds were shut and it was candle lit. We ordered a variety of starters, which included potato gnocchi in blue cheese sauce (my sweet god), deep-fried gator bites (holy moly) and deep-fried pickles (drooling all over my keyboard as I type). We were blown away by the flavours.We couldn't set on just two mains as we wanted to try many many things, so we ordered pork ribs, beef brisket and the soft shell crab burger. The brisket was quite a bit tough to be honest, but everything else was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend said he never had better pork ribs in his entire life. All mains came with fries, but we also ordered poutine which I had tried once in Canada and wanted to try again (it was PERFECT) and beer-battered onion rings (which DID NOT crumble into pieces when you touched them, as pub-food ones usually do).We finished it off with a flaming bear and a shortcake strawberry cheescake for dessert. As well as a couple of cocktails. The staff is extremely kind, knowledgeable and efficient, as well as a pleasure to interact with. They offered a killer double shot at the end of the meal as a happy birthday homage. The other half described The Fat Bear as 'twenty square feet of bloody perfection' and I couldn't agree more. Next time we'll be trying their brunch. Couldn't recommend this place enough. We paid quite a bit of money but we ordered A LOT of food, and it was worth every penny.",

Fat Bear satisfies that need though with southern style food that is every bit as good as that from one of our favorite restaurants in Dallas. I am afraid I can't recall the names, but we have had numerous different cocktails, and they have all been excellent. We usually start with the fried pickles, which are quite good. For mains, my partner always gets the country fried steak while I have experimented a bit more. I think the buffalo chicken sandwich will be my new go to. We also always get the Mac and cheese on the side. It has a real nice spice to it. The service here is also excellent. The last time in as easily the best service we have seen in London. They are attentive without being evasive.",

I'll switch from Bearlish to English for the sake of this review.What I was trying to say was, \"Come as a normal human, leave as a fat bear!\"That's the best way that I can explain coming to this bingerie. First of all... finding this place, even with City Mapper, is like trying to find a piece of bear poo in a forrest. Just remember it's in a side alley off of the street address so keep looking and you will be rewarded like a Bear King! RAAARRR! Back to English...Let's see what I binged on:Fried pickles (yummy! but could use more chunky pieces)Collard Greens - MMMM!!! Taste like I'm in Mississippi!Sweet Potato Fries (This was more like SP chunks and damn good chunks)Mac 'n Cheese (More cheese than Mac making it stew-ish, but you will never hear me complain about more cheese!)Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo (My gums and the teeth attached to them were pleased with this dish!! More refined than the typical Louisanna-style, but still Gumby!... errr.. I mean Yummy....)Catfish - CATFISH! I haven't even seen that on a menu since I left the US! I was super happy to have this huge fried slab of c-fish on a plate in front of me and you better believe it didn't stand a CHANCE again me!! RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!Oreo Cheesecake (one more time.... oreo..... cheesecake... I need not say more)In the end little half-asian 61.3Kg Dennis the human left this bingerie as 85Kg+ Dennis the fat grizzly bear.Raaaaar ra ra raaa raaaaaaaar r rrar rrrrrra RAAAAAAAAAARRR!! (Looking for some Southern American cuisine sure to leave your belly 185% full? This is the place for YOU!)",

Good portion sizes for the price point. TRY A PICKLEBACK. Just do it. Not nearly as gross as it sounds.Whenever I return to London, The Fat Bear will be sure to be one of my stops.",

    "text": "There is a reason I'm choosing The Fat Bear as my first review.I visited this cosy restaurant tucked away in the side streets near Blackfriars a few months ago- however, unfortunately, I didn't have Yelp at the time so all my raving was limited to my friends and family.Thankfully, for my friends sake, I now have Yelp - so I can finally leave the review that this place really deserved.A sensible place to start will be with the food. AMAZING. WHOLESOME. HEARTY. DELICIOUS. All these are words that fall short of describing just how good the food was. Every course, from the corn dogs and hot wings starter, through the short rib and game gumbo main to the Oreo cheesecake and apple pie dessert was packed full of soul. In fact, the only way it could have got any more soulful would be if James Brown shuffled out with the food himself, belting out \"Soul Man\" at the top of his voice.The fact that I can not only remember what I had several months later, but that it still leaves my mouth watering just thinking about it really is testament to the quality of the food experience I had there. Now, I must confess something. I was with my girlfriend (I couldn't possibly have eaten all of the above myself) and I remember the overwhelming food envy and consuming jealousy I felt when her short rib came out - a huge single rib of tender, meaty goodness what can only have come from some kind of super-cow. I remember that sinking feeling of regret that I, fool that I was, had ordered the game gumbo instead. But this feeling didn't last for long. One forkful of gumbo in and all my fears were washed away by the explosion of meaty, spicy flavour. It didn't matter that it was a typical rainy windy day outside. I could close my eyes and find myself in the warm sun of the deep south. Okay, that's enough about the food. Next stop, atmosphere.Being faced with the busy boozer at street level, and the well-worn stairs to take you up to the Fat Bear, you might be forgiven for having second thoughts. But don't. What greets you at the top is a positively charming, cosy and friendly dining room. It's not a big place, but that only adds to the intimacy and really makes it feel like you've found somewhere quite special. I felt like this was my own secret discovery (despite the rest of the tables being full of happy eaters) and that I'd really nailed it with this choice of date spot.The music is an excellent, eclectic choice and suits the vibe of the place. The staff are excellent and very attentive - their care and passion for the place is really infectious. Ask about their cocktails, try them and whatever you do don't leave this place without a pickle back or two.I couldn't recommend The Fat Bear highly enough. I can't wait to return shortly to try some of the new menu items - although please don't all go at once because I need a table!",

    "text": "After a full day at Tate Modern, my husband and I were craving to have a hearty dinner. We decided tocross the river and wander around St. Paul. Best decision because we stumbled upon this cozy restaurant.What initially attracted us was the noise. On a small side street, people were spilling out from a pub, all seemingly ecstatic that it was finally a Friday night! As we drew nearer, we saw a stairway that led to a second floor with the restaurant's sign. A quick search on Yelp revealed that it was a highly rated place!So off we went and immediately loved the dim lighting and small space. That delightful British accent filled the area and that's always a delightful thing.By the way, this isn't an English pub, but a Creole-inspired restaurant. Think: gumbo and barbecue shrimps and lots of spice! YUMMMMM.We got the spinach dip which was such a good starter. Fresh, chunky. And for mains, my husband got the mushroom and biscuits. I got the barbecue shrimp and biscuits. Everything was a hit!! Everything was so hearty and flavorful and perfectly warmed our tummies on a cold winter night. Wish we could've gotten dessert too but we were so tired from the long day that after such a meal, all we wanted to do was crawl under the comforter!Five stars indeed!",

The service was excellent, everyone was very warm and welcoming. It was also off this nice, little alley and the restaurant had a lot of charm. The food was amazing! I had the mac and cheese and my fianc\u00e9 had one of the burgers (which both sound simple enough) but they were soooo good, not your average burger and mac and cheese. We were too full before dessert so we didn't have anything but I regret not trying the Oreo cheesecake - I'm sure it would have been fantastic!",

The food is a great representation of southern comfort food. The buffalo wings are as good as you will find in the USA, but enhanced because the blue cheese is actually real blue cheese. The pimento cheese is legit, creamy and delicious. We also had the gumbo, which was very tasty. The jambalaya was good although lacked in spice. The mac and pimento cheese was as good a mac and cheese as I've ever had. The chicken sandwiches got thumbs up from our kids. The owner was very attentive and the service was great. I would highly recommend.",

    "text": "Fried chicken and waffles! Soft shell crab burgers! Crayfish rolls! Fish cakes! Jumbalya! And pickle backs! This place has many of the American classics with a modern twist. Their cocktails are excellent and their wine list is great too. I'm not a big fan of American food and don't eat a huge amount of meat but if you are/do then this is definitely worth a visit. Some of the sauces were a little on the sweeter side for me but the flavours all work well together. Standout dishes, for me, were definitely the chicken livers (don't fear the offal!), the boneless beef short rib (wow) and the crayfish roll. But most of all the tuna salad was so fresh and delicious. And I have already decided that when I come back here I'm definitely getting a martini and fried pickles on the side. If you're a sweet tooth definitely leave room for dessert. And get a couple to share so you can try as many as possible.Space wise, there's a great table off the side for a bigger group and then lots of smaller places. They haven't tried to theme the place too usa- aka you wouldn't think that it's American food by the decor. That's a good thing. Feels a little bit like someone's dining room at home. With a very well stocked spirits collection. Great staff who know their booze and can help you if you're unsure what to chose. And just generally friendly and good for a chat. Check it out!",

Chicken and waffles were terrific, the honey mustard maple syrup sauce was a perfect mate for this dish. The house recipe drinks are delicious, especially the Bear House Punch. The restaurant is small, cozy, and inviting. The waiter and bartender were so friendly, patient, helpful, and kind. They made our family of seven feel very welcome.

I was initially attracted based on the reviews and food offered (American soul food). Plus everyone at my work highly recommended the restaurant.I was very impressed with the decor. It has a romantic cozy atmosphere while still retaining a laid back vibe. My husband doesnt particularly like fancy restaurants and the Fat Bear perfectly straddled the line between very nice and too swanky. The candle lit ambience was very nice in the small venue. The music choice was interesting without being too loud to hinder conversation. Overall, it was perfect.Despite being a Saturday night, the venue wasn't slammed. There was only one waiter and one bartender working, but they still ensured that all tables were looked after. The waiter was very attentive and had an American quality customer service, which was greatly appreciated.The food was probably the highlight of the evening! My husband had the slow rib, which he said was maybe the best thing he had ever eaten. The food had a subtle spice with a smokey flavor. They even had real maple syrup on the desert waffles! It was very good food and we left feeling very full. In fact, I felt full far into the next day! I was very happy with our evening here as it was exactly what I was looking for! Thank you Fat Bear for making our evening very special!",

Situated a stone's throw from St Paul's Cathedral above a pub, the small dining room feels intimate without being cramped.The staff are friendly, and willing to help - my dining partner has dairy allergies, and our server was more than happy to go talk to the chef to get recommendations on what would suit her.Drinks are good - a fantastic selection of spirits and cocktails. We didn't look at the wine list, but if beer is what floats your boat, then they have a choice of Brew Dog Kingpin Lager or Punk IPA - both excellent beverages. The server brought iced water to the table without being asked as well, which was a pleasant surprise.Food though is what this place is all about. They specialise in American soul food, and the menu left me drooling and struggling to choose. In the end, I selected the gumbo, which was superb - very tasty, full of generous amounts of sausage, chicken and prawn, with a nice, gentle spice level (no need for copious amounts of milk or iced water to soothe the burn!) with a side of cornbread. The cornbread is baked to order, so takes around 15 minutes, but was delicious and worth the wait. I also plumped for the fried pickles, which was a portion big enough for at least two, but still nicely moist in the centre (i.e. not deep-fried to oblivion).My dining partner went for the brisket, which was also a generous portion, and very tasty, just falling apart.The bill overall was very reasonable - just over \u00a330 each including a gin and tonic each, so quite reasonable for Central London. All in all, an excellent dining experience, and one I hope to repeat in the future - I have my eye firmly on the jambalaya next time!",

Well placed as a single diner in the adjacent room - nice vibe, but not in the main traffic. Great recommendations from the server on the dinner options - I had the gumbo - MAJOR YUM! But I'm sure the fried chicken & waffles, or beef short ribs would have been equally good. Other diners had the hamburgers - looked delicious. I ended with a key lime pie - just lovely.

My husband's Short Rib dinner was not enjoyable. \u00a0It was a poor cut of meat - mostly cartilage - and the meat needed a steak knife to cut it was so tough. \u00a0It should have fallen of with a fork. \u00a0The cocktails were good but the one we initially wanted were not available as they were out or primary ingredients. \u00a0We did not order dessert. Overall, it wasn't \u00a0worth my money. \u00a0The fish and meats were poor quality and they depended on heavy spicing or saucing to compensate for the lack of quality.",

    "text": "Amazing Southern food, the best cocktails of my life, and the friendliest of service? Fat Bear, you are my spirit animal.I kicked the night off with a Sazarac and the chicken and waffles. The Sazarac was strong but offset with the perfect amount of sweetness, making it a perfect partner for the entree I ordered. The chicken was perfectly crispy and tender, with just a touch of heat in the syrup that accompanies it. \u00a0From there, I decided on a dessert of Oreo cheesecake, and matched it to the Little Country Gentleman, a drink made with rye whiskey, root beer, sherry, amaro, and bitters. \u00a0Awesome! I was ready to pay and leave when I decided to have one more drink. This time I decided to make it bartenders choice, as clearly they knew what they were doing. Ryan, who is an expert mixologist, took great care in making me one of his favorite drinks: Remember the Maine. He gave me a history of the drink and its creator (Charles H. Baker), along with a full rundown of what I was drinking: essentially a Manhattan without bitters, with a hint of absinthe and a taste of cherry. So good. \u00a0I decided it was time to go before I got myself in trouble. But I will be back. You've gotta come here. Totally worth the trip!",

And while some dishes were definitely stronger than others, the variety alone made for a fantastic meal.I do wonder though, why do British restaurants insist on putting crumbly topping on mac and cheese? Not enough cheese, too much crumbly distractions. The staff was great, there were great dishes (and some okay ones) and fantastic company! What more could one ask for!",

The area that it is in seemed to have alot of small bars that spilled out into the street. You have to walk up a set of stairs to get to the very small and dimly lit dining room. We had a reservation as is the norm in Europe. I found the food to be average. I found the food to be no better than a normal restaurant. The mac and cheese was very overpriced and not worth more than 5 dollars. Overall if you want some BBQ in a cool hip area and you are in the area stop by. But I would not make a out of your way trip for this restaurant.",

I ordered fried chicken and waffles which both individually tasted good, but not actually that complementary as a dish. I wasn't a huge fan of my cocktail, however, having said that, I do have to say that the barman was really accommodating and edited the cocktail to try and suit my taste buds so whilst I wasn't overly happy with the end result, the effort was there!In fact, the service overall was good, but they were almost a little too attentive by asking how the food/drinks were as soon as the fork made its first landing back to the plate. At times, it almost felt like our conversation was being eavesdropped by the other waiters to be honest...The actual space is a cute size with intimate, dim lighting and has a speakeasy vibe to it, so, if anything, it'd probably be better for a date night than a gathering with a large group of friends.",

The room is lit by low lighting and candle light and the feeling of home and comfort is undeniable.The service throughout the evening was fantastic -the team were very friendly, informative and literally couldn't do enough for you.Now, to the food! We were a large group of 15 and pre-ordered from their menu which was thanksgiving themed. The restaurant itself is American inspired soul food so I had high exceptions from the start. Plate after plate, the food just kept on coming!The personal highlights for me were: Starter: The potted game served with caramelised onion and bread - this was just to die for. So flavoursome and rich, just a beautiful dish.Main: the turkey legs were cooked to perfection and the trimmings complimented eachother well. The stand out for me was the seafood gumbo - it certainly packed a punch but the seafood within was meaty and the scallops on top were a nice lil added bonus!Dessert: Oreo cheesecake - need I say more?! Creamy with a crunchy biscuit base. Perfectly made and it went down a treat! This place really did tick all the boxes for me and I'll definitely be heading back for some more once I've digested these meal which I feel may take a while.",

I wasn't hungry anymore, swear I couldn't eat any more, but I ate my entire slice.

The reason I don't hesitate to round up is because 4 stars just wouldn't do this place justice.We came here on a Saturday at 7, it was empty when we walked in but was quickly filling in as we ate. It's situated above a pub right around the corner from St. Paul's Cathedral. The restaurant itself looks like it was set up in someone's apartment, but it kind of works. It adds to the quaint feel of th restaurant.The service was absolutely outstanding. Beyond being extremely polite, you can tell they really care about their food and drink. Something to definitely be appreciated.I would highly recommend the pimento cheese with tortilla chips and the buffalo wings. Both were ridiculously good! The boneless beef rib was good, but a little tough for my liking, although the sauces that came with it were amazing! We also ordered the disco fries but I will probably skip that next time and try something else.If you're looking for a different American-style meal, come here!",

This place served up the most calorific but also tastiest plate of food I've had in ages.We came here for a Friday team lunch so had a long table for 9 and essentially took over the back room. It's well tucked away above the Rising Sun pub with little to give away what sits upstairs, so you really have to know it's there. We booked for midday so were practically the first to arrive and our server greeted us warmly.She settled us in for a hearty (though probably not so good for your heart) feast. We shared starters of Gator Bites which I loved, in panko breadcrumb with a moreish sweet chilli dip, and some poutine just because one of the girls hadn't tried it. The mains could probably start an obesity epidemic but cover some good old-fashioned southern classics with gumbo, chicken & waffles, burgers and ribs. I couldn't resist trying the Chicken Fried Steak out of curiosity and promptly made everyone jealous when it arrived - it was probably the largest main course portion at the table! I got particular green eyes from my foodie colleague who went for the jambalaya and got quite a small pot. The clue is in the name - it is indeed a rib-eye steak deep fried in buttermilk and seasoned flour, and like nothing I've tried before. The taste was amazing - combining the best parts of eating fried chicken with the fun of eating steak underneath. There were a few overly fatty bits I left behind but otherwise I was very happy with it, served with a peppery gravy and some pleasingly skinny fries. I definitely felt a bit like a fat bear after that. The decor is very white-walls-wooden-tables plain, but then it's a limited residency so understandable. The service was very attentive too, in fact almost overly so - it was actually quite annoying to start with as she kept coming over, adjusting one thing (e.g. straightening a fork or filling one water glass), then walking away only to return 20 seconds later and repeat. But I think she stopped coming on so strong once the place filled up, and she was happy to chat about some of the things on the menu we had questions about.Food comas ensued for most of the afternoon back at the office, so beware if you choose it for lunch. It's open all day though so you could probably make better use of the drinks menu in the evening, and think it works well for couples and groups alike as long as you book ahead. The best part is it's pretty good value for what you get, and I'd definitely go back - but one to take a break between visits methinks!",

On a hot summer night, with no air circulation whatsoever, we kept chugging water with lots of ice to cool ourselves down. Then we proceeded with ordering wings (tiny), tacos, a few other stuff that I can't seem to recall and drinks. Dear reader, have you ever seen this video on instagram or your facebook feed, where chefs prepare little burritos for little hamsters? Those burritos and little guys were really cute, right? Well we got those burritos, unfolded, served as tacos. I felt the rage when I stared at my tacos and decided to drink my misery..wait, what? I got a margarita that is literally a sample size drink but charged fully. Come on now, tequila, lime and agave syrup are no expensive ingredients and ice is a really, really important part of this drink. Especially when you do not have an AC in your restaurant and all your windows are closed. We will probably not be back.",

It's really just a room and a half, which makes it super cozy and they have a pretty awesome looking bar. It's got warm lighting which makes the atmosphere really nice. Their cocktails were delightful and the service was excellent. I will make a very strange observation that someone working there had a very drunk friend who just sort of made herself at home. Then more joined and it turned into me watching this table of really really drunk people trying to order food. Two of them ended up just falling asleep. It was super strange. Anyway, me being distracted aside, I really loved the cocktail I ordered- Sloe Boat To China, and everyone else seemed happy with theirs. I was dying to try the pimiento cheese starter and the fried pickles. The cheese was particularly sharp and delicious. The pickles were good, but quite skinny (I mean come on, you're in an American restaurant I was expecting some serious pickles). The vegan gumbo was super spicy and delicious. I was impressed and enjoyed it. My husband dropped the ball and ordered the regular jambalaya (with sausage) rather than the seafood one which broke my heart a little bit, because I really wanted to try it. You know, I guess that means we'll just have to come back. Oh also another bonus, this place has brisket which is really hard to find. I can't say how it tastes but my friend said he defo approves (am I becoming more British with these words, or just more annoying?)Anyway, to finish it off I had the oreo cheesecake which the bomb. I love oreos. And it tasted like oreo. So all was right with the world. A wonderful place to come if you have people who want to try American food, or if you have out of town Americans who are too scared to try other food, or if you have hungry friends that want to try cajun food, or if you just want to try some really yummy food.",

It's above another place called the rising sun pub. A little \u00a0annoying they close early. We had to be there no later than 9.15pm as the kitchen closes 9.30pm. Would have been a bit nice for more eye contact from waiters and provided a knife and fork to eat without asking. Starters were great the chicken on our main was cooked to perfection wonderfully crispy on the outside and cooked well and moist on the inside. The waffles with our chicken and waffle main was nothing to write home about and their current dessert menu is rather uninspiring. Overall a ok experience.",

It was with some trepidation we headed up the stairs, especially as there isn't a hostess station. But it was all fine and we were quickly seated. The menu was full of things I wanted, so I went for two small plates - corn dogs with andouille sausage and pimento cheese with oatcakes. Both were delish! Definitely share the cheese with a couple people as it's a lot. Service was great. Coke is pricy at \u00a32.50 for only 200ml. Next time will include the deep fried pickles. Or the cheesy spinach dip. And some Oreo cheesecake.",

Service was good, and we got a table for two without a problem.The menu is Deep South-ish. But there's some American classics too - deep fried pickles for example. I had two of the smaller plates, the chicken tenders and the gumbo. Both were excellent. The chicken was quite dark, but that's just buttermilk coating done right. Just the right consistency and the chicken was perfectly succulent. The gumbo was big for a little plate - they do it in two sizes and I thought I'd might have ordered the larger one by mistake. But it was the smaller one, which makes me wonder if I could have gone for a swim in the big one! ;)Great meal, good service, and I would happily come back.",

It came out hot and crispy but didn't have very much flavour or juicy enough for a 5 star piece of chicken. The waffles were offensively bad. They looked and tasted like frozen waffles. Thin, soggy and a little freezer burn flavour. The syrup was this sriracha maple sauce which was ok but didn't add enough depth of flavour to make it worth using over a good maple. Felt like it went with the chicken but fought with the waffle. I would have preferred a classic maple and then add flavour with a side of country gravy. If all you want is a decent piece of crunchy fried chicken, this is a fine place. For the rest of the dish, meh. Not sure this was good enough to inspire another visit to try the rest of the menu.",

We got wings and chips, as the BF was on the fence about chicken and waffles. Being from the States and loving the south, I was torn with what to order but ended up going with chicken and waffles. It's not your typical southern-style chicken n waffles but this was a nice flair on the normal dish. With the dish came a honey mustard syrup - which, like the chicken, was a nice twist on the normal maple syrup. BF ordered chicken wings which were too hot for him so we swapped plates. We were both happy with the dishes! I also had a rootbeer flats - yummy drink :) Overall, I'd recommend it if you're in the area. If you're not close, I wouldn't go toooo far out of your way for it. It's very small, quaint, and intimate and does require a tight staircase to ascend to get to the restaurant so if you do have a disability that interrupts your mobility, I would avoid this restaurant.",
