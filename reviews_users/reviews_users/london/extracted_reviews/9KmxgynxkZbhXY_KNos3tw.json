Queues after 9pm on a Saturday reveal a cliquey ladidah crowd, more bar queues in the midst of Essex boys on the hunt provide a hint, and the badly mixed cheesy tunes - nothing Latino at all - provide all the confirmation that this is not the place where great nights are made.",

Food arrived lukewarm and after requesting hot sauce from THREE different waiters (and never receiving it) we tucked in. The final icing to the evening was that we were then mis-charged on the bill with no apologies. Certainly won't be back anytime soon!",

We decided not to have the special happy hour margarita as it was made with agave syrup rather than Triple Sec or Cointreau, probably rendering it sweeter than the surface of the sun. (I do love to mix metaphors!) So, a classic margarita it was. Well, that and a bit of a shock... \u00a38 each! I searched for the diamonds hidden at the bottom of the glass, but found none. It was perfectly respectable, the service was slightly colder than average and the place is very very cool. Almost every table was reserved, so I assume that it gets much busier later on in the evening. I may go back and try it when it's a bit busier, but I will have to remortgage first.",

The different coloured tiles around the whole place add to the real South American theme, and the drinks are not too expensive either. The only warning is tat there will ALWAYS be a queue on Friday and Saturday, and it is ALWAYS rammed. But if you can perch on a seat somewhere with some beers, then it's a great place for night out.P.s I know this is becoming a bit of a theme, but the toilets are also incredible - each cubicle is a beach-hut!",

Even the toilets were impeccably clean and quite stylish.A few things it really needs to work on: faster service at the bar and (last but not least) air circulation. I know England tends to get cold, not hot, but please invest in a more up-to-date method of air conditioning. Even the toilets downstairs were boiling!

    "text": "Before graduation, my Tequila Tuesday conspirator and I decided we wanted to have a big shindig for everyone. We rented out \"The Caravan\" at Barrio East, and spread the word as far and wide as we could.Arriving at BE, we were surprised to find it basically empty. There had been some confusion with our reservation and the name on it, so that they were expecting us at 8pm and we arrived at 9:30pm, but even then, it was quite quiet for the night. We took up our post in the Caravan and settled in for a night of good cocktails and good company.By the time I left several hours later, several pounds poorer (\u00a310 a cocktail, oof!), and several tequilas consumed, the place was hopping with friends and invitees for our event. We had a great turnout, which turned a relatively subdued place into an exciting party. I think this was the best way to see Barrio East, because while their atmosphere is really cool and the decorations fascinating, classy and funky, the place is meant for a good time.A good time was had though! Our first server was great, though as the night wore on and our party swelled around the bar, we lost our table service. I didn't see a ton of dancing, but the back garden was tempting, and the whole of the staff was very helpful in handling our big group (I'm guessing we were 50+ at one point!). The drinks were delicious and experimental, though as I mentioned not easy on the wallet.All in all, a successful Tequila Tuesday, and a memorable one!",

Tell me why was I in a queue for an hour+?! I didn't really mind waiting since I wasn't really in a rush to get anywhere but an hour wait to get in was ridiculous. Not to mention the sketchy people in line and the fact that the bouncers and door girls tried to act like this was Vegas or something. And by sketchy, I mean dodgy, and by dodgy I mean I was a little scared for my life. There was one guy who got a little too close to us... wasn't sure if he was trying to knife my friend in the back or ask for drug money. It was myself and 4 dudes and they tried to tell us after waiting for an hour that we needed a more even ratio. After talking them down for like 10 minutes, and also mentioning the huge group of over 10 girls in the other queue in front of us, they finally let up. Ridiculousness. After being in line for over an hour, we were completely parched and needed some liquids immediately. 1 shot of Jameson, 2 shots of Jager, 2 Moscow Mules and a Pina Colada later, it was time to call it a night. So to sum up, Barrio East is cool... good drinks, good music, but to wait an hour to get in? Forget about it. Maybe you can avoid this by coming earlier, like before 10??",

Second, their 'amigo hour' with \u00a34.50 cocktails, \u00a35 of selected bottles of wine and \u00a33 off Sagres beers between 4-8pm. Perfect for after work drinks. Lastly going out here for a night out. I've read a few reviews doubting this place for a night out, however I think it's great. Free entry, friendly staff, busy with young professional and a mixture of music. Especially love going here on a Friday night for a amigo hour then staying here or heading to one of the other great bars in the area.",

There was a dance floor which was packed with your typical drunk and frisky people. The music was loud and obscure with random remixes of 90s classics being forced into my ears. The music became slightly better towards midnight but it was nothing but a distraction from all the average aspects of this establishment.

The entire street had many bars to check out but we were suggested this place and enjoyed it very much.There's one room designated for dancing with bar area being a place to stand and some table since it is a restaurant as well.Drink were a little pricey, but that's expected to a major city.

The Tapas bar is located in the Shoreditch region of London, the happy \"amigo\" hour was offered M-F 4-8pm. \u00a0Brightly colored rooms, tropical/ Spanish/ Mexican theme I guess...? \u00a0service at the bar was slow, not sure why, - as only a few other patrons there. We ordered a cocktail that was offered at happy hour, sweet, weak and mostly ice! So we changed to beer, then decided to get food, the Super Barrio Nacho was our choice. The Nachos arrived soon after our order was placed, probably microwaved as the nachos where soggy and the size was not at all \"super\", perhaps I was expecting American Size. Talk about small plates, this nacho order was so small! Disappointing, after tax they cost \u20ac12, overpriced, we decided to pass on dinner there. The bar had a patio out back, standard picnic table, placed close together. It was a weeknight, no one out on the Patio, the murals painted on the patio walls, looked like I painted them, and believe me I am not an artist! The bathrooms for the bar are downstairs and quite a distance from the bar. One interesting thing about the water closet was there were two toilets in one stall, not sure what that was about...?It's right on the bus line, so easy to get to, no taxi needed. The tube station was quite a distance, not knowing the neighborhood, we decided to take the bus since the bus stop was right outside the bar. I'm guessing this place could be fun b/c it's brightly colored. Granted it was not a weekend. But I was put off by little service & little portions & big prices.",

Music was overall good -- a mix of 90s pop through recent hits. Service was okay, though getting drinks at the bar took a while. If you get there around 9pm, things aren't too bad. Looking forward to returning!",

They also have refreshing drinks. The bartender was funny and engaging even though he was struggling to understand us and we easily forgave him when he forgot to make my friend's cocktail. It's always refreshing when someone just apologies when they make a mistake without giving excuses. You get a lot of food for your money and it comes quickly after you order. The decor is cool too. A mixture or random colours that match the food and drinks they offer.The only downside was the mild sewage smell downstairs on the way to the bathrooms. It was slightly unpleasant, which unfortunately isn't uncommon for basement areas.",

Decent cocktails but really poor service.The door staff, particularly one fellow, were so rude! There is a separate queue for parties with reservations - we told him our friends name and he said he didn't see it on the list. We get in the back of the (long) non-reservation queue. 20 minutes later we get to the front and now there is a woman working the door. I ask her to check my friend's name and she finds it on the list. This is where it gets weird: I explain to her that we had just given her previous colleague the name of our party and he did not let us in. She then collects the fellow from before to come outside to speak with us. I'm unsure why this was necessary. The rude fellow from before comes out. \u00a0He said he didn't remember us (from 15 minutes ago). He asked if we were \"accusing him of purposely lying\" to us previously. Well, no we weren't accusing of you of lying. He was inherently defensive and super argumentative over this. He apologized out of necessity but you could sense his reluctance and annoyance with us (again because we were supposedly \"accusing him of lying\") in his voice.We got in, paid cover (icing on the cake really.) The table service was also horrible but our server was really sweet so that slightly made up for it.Long story short, they let us in after a long unnecessary wait but didn't even offer to comp the cover charge! 2 stars because the cocktails are tasty and the bar staff was nice but everything else about this place makes it dreadful.",

Luckily we were so embarrassingly on time that we arrived at the same time as the bday girl - which meant we got to queue jump right in with her with no wait on the door.Inside she'd thankfully booked an area as otherwise it would've been v awkward to stand around in such a large group and no one was dancing yet. As it was we got a reasonably-sized seated area and some welcome chat from a v charming Brazilian (so he claimed) waiter.Chaming or no, I opted out of the table tab so I could buy the bday girl something - cue a lengthy bar wait but it was worth it as my cocktail took the biscuit (ba-dam-bam-tsssh). You want the Ram Berry Jam - vodka, homemade raspberry jam and cava. It's the one served with the jammy dodger on top :)Maybe I've been spoiled by bars with lengthy cocktail bibles, so only 10 options on this menu seemed quite compact. Still, the music and bright decor gave the place a fun vibe. I'd go back - though equally I now also want to go buy a pack of jammy dodgers and eat the whole lot in bed. 3 stars it is!",

The only thing was that the security guys made us pack up and leave before 1:45 when the place closed at 2 and it was clearly written on my reservation placard that I had it from 9-2.

So they offered her an area at Barrio East including a free round of drinks.It's really bad they didn't tell her about Central and had let her book there but it's very good that they did a round of drinks when the cocktails were about \u00a39 each and there were about 18 of us.I'd definitely recommend booking as they checked each person had a reservation on the door and by about 9:30pm there was a huge queue. It's a fun place with great Latin American decor and quite an eclectic mix of music. I've never heard House of Pain's 'Jump Around' mixed with a funky almost Jamaican tune...surprisingly it worked though! The music was a little loud for me (yes, I'm getting old!) and I was struggling to have conversations. My ears were also ringing when I got home.The drinks are pricey but good (the raspberry jam cocktail was delicious and came with a jammy dodger!) but it can take a while at the bar. They do 50ml spirits/liqueurs as standard and before 8pm cocktails are \u00a35 so good value.We had a good night and I'd go again.",

Then they can get pretty annoying. Plus you've got to pay to get in (after 11 I think? I don't know what time they start charging).The decor is nice though. They have happy hour (before 8) which means you get \u00a35 off wine bottles and \u00a35 cocktails. They are a bit too sweet for my taste, but I don't really like sugar so if you do, go for it! Wine wise, their Malbec is OK. The food is OK too. Music is what you'd expect, meant for people to dance and have fun to which is what you want from that kind of place really.I've been several times, and on two occasions there were many clients and the bar staff was very slow during happy hour and getting a drink was a bit of a drag. I only wanted a wine bottle and it took nearly 15 minutes for me to get it...They have a nice garden area, where you can escape the noise and chat and have a drink (no drinks outside after 10 though).The part of the venue on the left of the bar is better and that's where you'll usually end up if you book a table.All in all it's not a bad place - there are many worse choices you could make in the area, but many better ones too.",

When we arrived, we were greeted by the door staff, they asked if we had a reservation or if we were only coming in for a drink. We weren't sure if there was a reservation made, and the door staff made us feel unwelcome because there wasn't a reservation made. After asking them if it was okay to just stay for a drink, they eventually let us in.Once inside finding our friends was a little bit of a task, as there is tons of rooms, and there were a lot of people. Finally locating our friends in the court yard, we set off for a drink. The bar staff were super friendly, and knew how to make excellent cocktails. I highly recommend the gingerbread colada. Unfortunately this is where the fun ended. We sat at the end of the table, with some people we didn't know. One of them caused a bit of a stir with the waitresses, and before we knew it tons of security, the manager and other waitstaff were at our table asking us to leave. They were extremely rude, and for not even a valid reason. I understand what the guy did was wrong, but to blame an entire table for someone's stupidity was completely uncalled for. We left, and went to a cute place next door, where the drinks were cheaper, the staff were friendly, and the atmosphere was fun. I would never ever go to Barrio East again.",
