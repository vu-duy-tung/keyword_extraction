Fortunately one of our party knew a taxidermist so we were halfway there. After failing to get in for dinner, we came back to experience the place and check it out for more organised nights in the future. As it was the end of the night, the service was far from stellar. A bit distracted. Fortunately the kitchen was still awake and we ate a delicious warm blackberry pie and custard. I'm not sure how I'll feel about dinner there, you have to pay 40 quid to get a decent sized piece of steak and the roast chicken looked a tad greasy. Plus the place was overrrun in hipsters. A blight on society ;-)My advice: book in advance! And the chocolate and blackberry ice cream is to die for.",

    "text": "Argh. Such a hard place to review.I was debating on four stars but honestly, I don't think place lives up to the hype enough to run out and tell everybody to go...and here's why:The starter course was exceptionally forgettable. Something waldorf salady, some miniscule meats, and a good but marginally tasty baked brad thing appeared. I can't really say any of these options were stand out. My 20 pound steak was very disappointing..and I have yet to have a \"great\" steak here. What alarms me the most is that Tramshed ONLY serves steak and chicken as mains (I think they have fish but the restaurant concept is Steak and Chicken) and for that amount of focus, I don't accept a lack of panache.The chicken, however, was quite nice! Served at a stand, the quality was exceptional and worthwhile. Our \"skinny\" chips also had an extra level of awesome, but sadly this was due to some sage essence that only applied to the top level of the fries. Not bad, but not nearly the best I've had.I also tried the Hix Oyster stout/porter/whatever. It was nice, but not sure why it was \"award\" winning.Sadly, for as small as the menu was, I was not enthused enough to want to return. Sorry brah.",

    "text": "The best thin cut chips in London. This place might be known for its steak, but I snarfed down those chips like it was going out of style. The restaurant: Damien Hirst created The Cock and Bull piece specifically for the Tramshed, and is a great point of conversation for those new to the venue. People even refer to this restaurant as \"the one with the cow and chicken in formaldehyde in the center of the room\". The food: Known for its chicken and steaks, this restaurant serves a very limited menu, as it is best to do a couple items well then a lot so-so. If there are two or three of you it might be a good decision to order the largest steak and allow the waiter to carve it for you. Everyone can then pick there own pieces. If you order a steak, they do come a little more cooked than expected so perhaps a good idea is to order slightly rarer than you normally would.",

    "text": "Had a disastrous lunch here midweek. We were after a quick lunch so my friend and I skipped the Steak and Whole Chicken choices and browsed the lunch time sandwich specials. There were three sandwiches on the menu, a chicken sandwich, a steak sandwich, and a 'Cock and Bull' sandwich.'The Cock and Bull' Sandwich appealed to us, and was described 'in italics' as a Chicken and Steak Sandwich. Which is surely what the name suggests for \u00a39.50. Seemed like a good deal. So we decided we would order one of these to share. However once we ordered this Two Chicken and Bacon sandwiches appeared. So the kitchen made a mistake, but this wasn't my only gripe, I don't eat bacon, and nowhere on the menu does description for the chicken sandwich mention it is topped with bacon. Big mistake.. Had I even ordered this I would have had a problem...We asked the waiter to return the sandwiches, and the Manager came out and said there is no such thing as a chicken and steak sandwich, and that it is simply a chicken sandwich and a steak sandwich alongside it? Sounds like a load of Cock & Bull to me!Anyway no body was quite sure what was right, the waiter admitted the menu was misleading, a steak sandwich returned alongside a chicken sandwich which looked like it was one of the earlier ones that had been sitting under a heat lamp for 15 minutes. We ordered some brussel sprouts but they never arrived. The Sticky toffee pudding dessert sounded good but not \u00a312.50 good, at that price it was more expensive than our main!We decided to get the bill to find that not only had they charged us for two separate sandwiches a 'steak sandwich' and a 'chicken sandwich', they had also included the brussel sprouts which had never arrived. We mentioned the mistake, they removed the brussel sprouts without even a hint of an apology for the fact that we didn't receive them.The whole reason we had ordered the 'Cock&Bull' \u00a0(which to clarify is a separate item listed below both the 'chicken sandwich', and the entirely separate item the 'steak sandwich') was the fact that it seemed like a great deal, Steak and Chicken in 'one' sandwich, and we were going to share this, we never realised we would be charged for two separate sandwiches. Cock & Bull is listed on the menu for \u00a39.50.The Waiter hats off to him disappeared again to the Manager, and came back and said everything was on the house. Good resolution finally, but the numerous mistakes and confusion marred the visit. Shame as I had high hopes for Tramshed.",

Apple pie for dessert was quite different than the American apple pie I'm used to. (It was round, and came with a tiny pitcher of cream). The starter of chicken liver pate and Yorkshire pudding was interesting. They also helped me pair my steak with an excellent red wine.

    "text": "Tramshed was unreal. I'm visiting my boyfriend from Manhattan and we were searching for dinner somewhere last night near his flat. We stumbled upon this on yelp and thought it'd be worth checking out. We arrived without a reservation and the hostess was sweet enough to seat us pretty much immediately at a table. To start, this place HUGE! They have it in a warehouse-like building with a ginormous cow \u00a0\"floating\" in the center of the restaurant.Started off with a couple of beers and the yorkshire pudding with whipped chicken livers (\u00a33.95). We weren't sure what the yorkshire pudding was going to be like as we both have never tried it before... and then... out comes this puffy pastry-like bread with a side of the whipped chicken liver. It was seriously the perfect pairing - with the savory and creamy taste of the chicken liver spread and the crunchy crust from the pudding.. soo good. The boyfriend generally isn't even a fan of chicken liver and he was scraping the rest of the liver with the rest of the bread. So pretty much what I'm saying is.. GET THIS, you will not be disappointed.Based off the majority of the yelp reviews, it looked like the roast barn-reared indian rock chicken with stuffing and chips (\u00a327.50 to share btn 2-3 ppl) was the thing to get. Literally between the time we were seated and the time we ordered, I think I saw 5 chickens come out for tables surrounding us. I don't normally like to order chicken at restaurants in fear that it'll be dry and flavorless. Not at this place!! The presentation was awesome as it's sitting in an upright position within a metal stand. The chicken itself was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. It was sooo moist and tender! Honestly this is one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had. And that stuffing! My goodness that stuffing was amazing especially with the gravy topped over it. They even supplied us with a separate plate of stuffing at no extra charge. Oh and can't forget the chips!! (or as we Americans call it fries) The fries were soo good, not too \"potato-y\" (I made that up and if you don't know what I mean by that, I don't know what to tell you) and perfectly crispy. Overall experience was really good!! Very good service and the everything we ate was perfect. I'd definitely come back.",

    "text": "Tramshed is a place I like to take visitors to. It captures the vibe of Shoreditch pretty well - industrial, modern, quirky, hipster, a bit pretentious... well you get it. You will find the interior interesting even if you don't have a taste for Damien Hirst or dead cows. Tramshed was a tramshed in the past - it once housed electricity generators for local trams, and was later converted into this chicken and steak restaurant by celebrity chef Mark Hix, who owns six other restaurants/bar in town. \u00a0And even if you don't like Damien Hirst, I am afraid it is pretty much in your face as the first thing that greets you when you step inside is a giant formaldehyde filled tank containing a chicken standing on top of a cow. \u00a0And yes! this is what you are going to eat tonight. \u00a0I quite like the humor actually, intended or untended. \u00a0There is also an art gallery in the basement where the restaurateur offers space for various artists to showcase their work. \u00a0Alright, onto the food. \u00a0I have been there on three separate occasions and have to say that execution is solid. When I say chicken and steak restaurant - that's the only choice you have in terms of mains. \u00a0I've had both. \u00a0The chicken is delicious albeit I believe some people will find its presentation abhorrent (look at the picture!) \u00a0The roasted skin was crispy and the meat succulent and moist, very flavorful and the skin smells nice. \u00a0(Just don't look at the dead chicken while you eat) For the steak, there is a choice between rib and sirloin. \u00a0Personally, I prefer the rib but try it out to see which one you like better. \u00a0On my last visit though, I had the sirloin and didn't think the quality of the meat is that great, doesn't taste very fresh. \u00a0The fries were really good though. \u00a0And that was just one visit, everything else has always been fantastic so I will give them benefit of the doubt. I also discovered that the shakes and desserts are to-die-for. \u00a0My favorite is the Eton Mess milkshake and the salted caramel fondue with marshmallows and donuts (order one to share). \u00a0Best marshmallows I had, so fluffy that I think maybe that's what a cloud will taste like. \u00a0Anyways, not a very healthy combination but who cares when you are at Tramshed. \u00a0Staff have always been attentive and funny, services efficient. I saw that they also offer an express lunch menu which is very good value. \u00a0I imagine if I work around Liverpool Street I will go all the time so if you happen to be there around lunch, try it as a taster. \u00a0Ideal place for group dinners, plus you can explore all the cool and hip bars and cafes in the area pre and post dinner. \u00a0I highly recommend.",

    "text": "CLUCK CLUCK MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO (that is all)Just kidding!... 4 stars goes to Tramshed. Hurrah. I had a jolly old time here for a spot of early Saturday evening dinner. Do you like Cow or Chicken? Well if so this is the place for you, because you ain't getting anything else.Initially I was likeWOOOOAHHHHH Freaky decor dudes!.... but in the end I loved staring at the giant Damian Hurst formaldehyde cow that was suspended over our heads. Especially because the cow had a hen perched on his back. What a Cock and Bull story indeed. I wanted to stroke my bovine friend. So cute. \u00a0Top marks to restaurant owner Mark Hix for for reflecting the menu in the art work. He also managed to get a giant Hurst cow and chicken cartoon work to hang at the back of the Tramshed. The building is also interesting too, built 110 years ago as an electricity generating station for trams. It's a great space but perhaps a bit cavernous and not giving the intimate feeling that diners might be after.And OMG! DRAMA MUCH .... other tables got served chickens diving into pools of potato fries. The bird had its legs akimbo with its claws intact sticking out into the air, and a knife up its derri\u00e8re. It reminded me of a rubber chicken, even though rubber chickens are based on real chickens. I guess i have never really seen chicken with claws on when served. \u00a0WOWEEEEEEE... our table neighbours ordered the porterhouse to share. It's basically like a giant platter of steaky goodness, and obscenely huge for two peopleYUM YUM NOM NOM... My Chateaubriand steak served with fries and an array of sauces arrived and it was so delicious. I \u00a0think I could have eaten one of those aforementioned obscenely huge platters now .Lastly, MmmmmmmmmmmmMELTY... the credit crunch ice cream is the cheapest dessert on the menu but it would take some beating, so it is probably is the best too. \u00a0Caramel ice cream with chocolate and honeycomb crunch served with a huge of warm chocolate sauce to pour over. Food heaven.From the decor to simple menu - Tramshed was so much better and less gimmicky than I thought it would be. \u00a0Simple good food and not as hideously expensive as I expected. A glass of prosseco, steak with fries and dessert came to \u00a332 each including service. Ignore the haters, aka the newspaper food reviewers, Tramshed do a good high quality no fuss dining experience but if you are after a more intimate and slow affair this probably isn't the place for you.",

    "text": "A Blind Date with Tramshed: Oh Tramshed, I'm just not that into you.I'm your jilted lover, left me wanting more, disappointed and blue. You swanky Hoxton minx \u00a0....it's no surprise. Left me teary-eyed, hollow and with a lighter pocketbook 'stead of stars in my eyes. Excited for my date with the glamourous Restaurant, Tramshed. Heard so much good press, and that the venerable Hix is his dad. Well-heeled and connected, who would have expected the worst? His creative Black Sheep Uncle, Damien Hirst, Hooked up Tram with sweet art : chicken atop a cow, submerged over eyes. In a tank full of electric blue formaldehyde. But back to the matter at hand, din. Couldn't charm or disarm old Tram, the beginning of the end.Service was slow, waitstaff like robots, gormless No personality, no spark or individuality, helpful but not passionate, definite miss. Well, Fair Yelper, Tramshed was not terrible, just not a great date. One occasion that I do not wish to recreate. And I certainly don't mean to be brash,But Mr. Tramshed was a case of all style and no substance, class but mostly flash. \u00a0All brawn and no brains.Young Tram came 'atcha girl all wrong, though no doubt he's makin' it rain. Ambiance large, sterile, your style's not my thing, I said.No flair, no excitement, was awake but behind my eyes flat lined, brain dead.And seated at such a bad table through it all? Environs left me comatose, could have stared a hole in the wall. (Actually, I was most likely looking at the cartoon mural of Cow and Chicken).Or dithering in the (cool) bathrooms, on my iPhone, snickering, ...About how to get out of this terrible date!With my man Young Tram, but had to eat dinner before I could escape. Indulged in steak, and the chicken.Felt so indelicate, trying to pick at it. Since the chicken arrived, not properly filleted for gastronomic ease.But with the feet tied together, a little messy for a dining experience...jeez! Aware it speaks to the greater concept, but I felt it was quite lazy. And the sirloin appeared overcooked, a bit gray ...eeek! Chips were fine, the desserts fared the worst. American apple pie dry, chocolate cake too-beginning to end, this date was cursed.Oh I was hoping to get lucky in rest-romance but Trammy you flunked. No passing grade from me baby boy, afterwards I felt Kutcher-style punk'd.For us it just was not in the cards. Nope! The stars did not align by far. It's fair to say we got along, Although our chemistry was all wrong.So Tramshed I wish you the best. With many more suitable lady-diners, I am sure you will be blessed.But if I may be cheeky? Since I'm on a high,Doubt your future suitors can spit a rhyme quite as fly.",

The house red was very average however a little heavy on the pocket for what it was. One thing The Tramshed does have going for it is the sides and the starters, in particular the beer battered greens and the chicken and beef croquettes. \u00a0 Good one off experience however much better steak available elsewhere for similar prices",

And they let you carve it yourself if you ask nicely! and for a wannabe butcher like myself that was a dream!Tramshed gets five starts because of a few things: quality of meat, atmosphere, interior design, Damien Hirst, and wine. If the giant Damien Hirst Cow and Chicken in formaldehyde doesn't have an effect on you, I don't know what will.There's also a nice mezzanine that overlooks the restaurant, which we booked out one night which was great.My absolute favourite dish on the menu is the Yorkshire pudding with liver pate. Seriously, you need to try it.And although I did embarrass myself the first time by asking what the beautiful building used to be (errr a shed for trams madam?) I keep going back and loving it every time.",

    "text": "Ohh tramshed! My wife and I were visiting London for about 5 days and we decided to stay in east London, shoreditch to be exact, which is a little edgier than what you would expect. We looked for popular dining experiences in the area and saw that tramshed was getting quite the buzz. So we decided to head there since it wasn't too far from the hotel. This place is sort of hidden in a side street so beware if you can't find it easily.The interiors are super rad. It is like an old building that was just gutted. 20 foot ceilings, real open plan layout. We ate sort of early, but on a Friday and we were able to get a table no problem before the rush.What this place is known for is chicken + beef + and chips. So we ordered their specialty, roasted full chicken and chips. That is exactly what you get, a huge beautiful roasted chicken perching like its on a beer can, with tons of fries (chips) around it. They come out with 4 different sauces, and you dig in! Very communal, conversational type eating.Was the chicken the best I had ever had? No. More like 3 star, but the overall experience led me to my 4 star review. We has delightful service worth noting.",

    "text": "I went here with some friends back in the fall, and WOW you should definitely come here hungry, because the portion sizes are tremendous. We ordered one whole chicken and one of the steak choices, plus a bunch of sides. The chicken comes with a generous helping of fries which we didn't know when we ordered fries separately.The giant cow in the formaldehyde box in the middle of the room is a little bit freaky, but you get over it pretty quickly when there's heaps of delicious meat, browned on the outside but pink all the way to the inside. I think we weirded out our server by asking him to leave the chicken neck and feet... (we're Asian, no kind of meat is too weird for us)Really tasty, and considering the amount of food they give you, quite a good deal. Bring a big group and a bigger appetite, and book one of the booths ahead of time!",

Have them both. The French fries make for a terrific side with their unique flavor of chicken dressing but it will be the steak to make you eye-balls pop out.The staff are super friendly and the service is fast - we waited less than 5 minutes for our food. The desserts are just ridiculously good.This is not a budget place whatsoever. But its worth every penny you spend there.5 stars.",

I also ended getting the pork crackling and apple sauce nibble/starter, which was amazing but make sure you've got teeth made out of steel as it was pretty hard to eat. The sandwich was made up of half chicken and half beef. Beef is cooked perfectly but you're aren't asked your preference of rare, medium/rare when you order, so could be an issue for a fussy eater. The chicken had to be the star, it had an amazing herbed crust and I wished the whole sandwich was chicken. You also get a huge bowl fries with it and some onion rings. So big I wish I hadn't had got the crackling. Atmosphere is great and I could see this place being a great venue to bring large groups. (Visit - 18/06/2015 Lunch)",

    "text": "I was happy to be flipping through one of my favorite travel magazines a few days ago, and see a picture of the chicken with legs that I came to realize is a unique dish among the London restaurant scene. While I didn't have that kind of chicken when I was at Tramshed for lunch, I did have a chance to try their chicken and beef. And dessert, but lets save the best for last. I had lunch at Tramshed a few weeks back on a Friday, and for a Friday lunchtime, it wasn't too busy at all. I always like being able to just walk in and be seated, and was even more pleased to be just by the giant formaldehyde chicken and cow centerpiece (though to be fair, it's hard to be far from it, even as big as tramshed is). While we caught up, we dined on the lunch sandwiches: mine just chicken, and his the half and half. The sandwich was a great size for lunch and the chips were really good. Not ready to end the lunch and feeling flush for having opted out of pints with lunch, we decided to split the salted caramel fondue, and I would trade beer for that dessert any day. With homemade marshmallows and some other dipping thing... Chocolate maybe? We put ourselves into a sugar coma on top of our protein coma. Tramshed is definitely cool, and reminds me of some of the really trendy places I've eaten in Chicago. Maybe that's not a compliment in true foodie circles, but it is coming from me. I'd love to come back and do dinner in a big way.",

    "text": "We made reservations for Tramshed to follow up on a visit to Tate Modern. Definitely way too much Damien Hirst for a day... However, despite the unusual choice in decor, I had high hopes for the food!We ordered the starters for our table:- Yorkshire pudding with whipped duck liver- Ham hock with green beans and shallots- Panzanella This was probably the highlight of our meal. The starters come together as a set, and rather than per dish, the price is set by the size of your party (~\u00a38/person). I really liked the ham hock and panzanella. The Yorkshire pudding was also really light and airy, which was great with the duck pate. For mains, we got a whole chicken for two, and steaks for everyone else. I was really excited to see the chicken dish, but though it looked interesting, the chicken was pretty dry. The steaks were also not very tender. Don't know what to say, but this was a big disappointment.Though the chicken and steak weren't great, I really liked the drinks we got. We had eton mess shakes, a cocktail, and a bottle of wine. I know this sounds like a strange combination, but the shake was reallllly good! We also tried their elderflower ice cream for dessert, which was also delicious! Not sure if I'd be back, but I do have to say we had a great time and the service was really great!",

The vast majority went for the chickens and so did I. You've probably seen them, legs up in the air and ready for everything. It was indeed, fantastic. Excellently cooked throughout, well spiced and with lots of chips to go with it. Plus the waiters cut it for you if you want but I'm a hands-on kind of person so I went face in and munched on every bit of it.I've had a sampling of salads and starters here and there, all were just as good and seemed to have been prepared carefully (minus the salmon that didn't live up to its exclusive Gravadlax declaration)Cocktails were nice - I had an Earl Grey something that came in a nice glass, looking as kisch as a fruit punch. Loved it though.The house wine was pretty good as well and matched the chicken - it was on the dry side (always a good sign).I'm already planning visit 2 and 3 and 4 and so on...",

We had someone coming to our table constantly asking us if we were done and wanted more, despite not even being half finished. It got pretty irritating and by the end of the meal I was quite glad to leave.Maybe the extra attention was because the staff wanted an excuse to look at the girl sitting on the next table to us..

    "text": "So I guess by now you know the menu choices are a mixed starter or no starter, the mains steak and chips or Chicken and chips and dessert ... Well the fact no one bothers to mention them tells you all you need to know about how interesting they are.Just to show my prejudices it is worth mentioning that I like this growing trend of having simple menus ... I like the idea of thinking what do I fancy eating and then going to the restaurant that does that ... Which is great as long as some form of meat is what one is looking for.So are the Steak and Chicken and chips worth eating?For the chicken there can be no question it is amongst the best roast Chicken in town and the Steak well it isn't Hawksmoor (and I am told Goodmans is also fantastic) so eating it here you have already chosen to eat at the second tier of steak restaurants and it is as good as that remark would make you think it is.As for the Tramshed venue well it is an enormous airy space dominated by an installation by Damien Hurst ... Although how much in put Damien had is open to question. I rather suspect it consisted of him looking at the cheque on offer and saying \"Sure for that much I will put you in touch with my contractor and signing my name to anything\". Broadly speaking it is one of those democratic open spaces that are all pale pine and visible cutlery draws.Soulless would be harsh but not unfair.Oh and did I mention the over priced cocktails and so so wine list?None the less I now have a location for when I fancy Chicken and chips to share with my friends ... I grant you I may not desire it as often as a Lobster or a green salad followed by steak and chips twice or even bbq but it is a worth addition.",

The only \"twist\" being that they stuck a slice of mango in it and sprinkled pepper on top. We ordered the house chicken which was good but not as great as the chips. We only finished 2/3 of the shared dish so I asked for everything to be boxed up. When I wanted to eat the leftovers a few hours later, I realized the flippant waitress only boxed up the chicken and nothing else which was not at all what I requested. That was disappointing since the chicken was definitely not the best part of our meal. The waitress was already incredibly careless and disinterested throughout our dinner service but I didn't expect her to fail so spectacularly at a simple request she probably gets quite often. I hope the Tramshed retrains their waitstaff and refreshes their cocktail menu by my next visit.",

Bizarre, perhaps, though it actually makes a bit of sense when you see the menu...all there is on offer is chicken or steak. Even the appetizers (yorkshire pudding, cauliflower puree, and picked walnuts with broccoli) cannot be individually ordered, you must get all 3. Clearly, there is no quandary of excessive choice at Tramshed.I've been twice and the steak is good, not Hawksmoor good, but certainly among the finer pieces of meat you can get in Shoreditch. The steak was properly cooked (I asked for medium rare and got medium rare) and expertly sliced in front of you, though a bit fattier than I would have liked. Next time I will have to try the chicken, I hear great things---though it is off-putting that the legs are kept intact, a bit gross if you ask me.There is much to like at Tramshed apart from the chicken riding the cow (and the cool rear-wall cartoon painting of a chicken and cow as bffs)...service is friendly, the drinks are strong, and the food is rather tasty. The dining room is a massive cavernous space and can get quite bright (on those rare sunny london day)...it's a venue that's perfect for a large group of your carnivore friends as only chicken and steak are on offer.",

    "text": "I had bookmarked this place so we decided to try it out \u00a0with no reservation on a Saturday night. Friendly welcome at the desk and they managed to squeeze us in sitting at the bar straightaway.The place itself is pretty big, packed and a bit of a destination place to go to. I like the semi industrial interior , the old tramshed. There's a huge Damian Hirst cow in a tank (God, yet another one) with a chicken on top of the cow. Oh, I get it... 'Cock and Bull'. Cleary they paid a lot for this centrepiece since it's the focal point of the restaurant. I veer between quite liking it and finding it irritating. At least it fit with the whole macho concept.Anyhow the food...It's the simple menu concept:Chicken or steak with one or two variants and sides.I ordered the spring chicken and chips for one and my partner a beef salad (probably not the best choice).The chicken came, famously, with feet attached sticking up in the air, rotisserie cooked and was great. Juicy and tender and with some stuffing inside and a tasty jus / gravy underneath, perfect for dipping the chips into. I quickly realised that there was no other way than to pull the tender chicken apart by hand bit by bit and savour the tasty meat and suck out the juices.Didn't have time to sample the desserts - looked good though.A select range of decent chilled beers on offer as well as wine and an interesting looking cocktail list which I will try next time.Service was excellent and friendly and hit just the right pitch.Good value too.",

    "text": "Let's start with the fact that there's a chicken riding a cow (ask one of the servers about the cow's name - apparently she had a lovely life) suspended in a massive tank of tranquil, turquoise formaldehyde... right in the centre of the dining room. I mean... how often do you get to have a meal whilst seated under gallons and gallons of preservative/carcinogen? It's truly a sight to behold.Beyond the kitchy d\u00e9cor, Tramshed, as a venue, is massively open and airy and somewhat reminiscent of a Victorian market hall. Offering both small two-tops and massive communal tables, it would be a decent spot for a casual dinner date or a group gathering. I think they may also have a private space in the back - we did see a bottle of Kahl\u00faa and two glasses get whisked off in that general direction.I was quite grateful to end up being seated at the bar (as is my wont). Not only can you get the full dining menu there, it was a grand opportunity to watch the bartenders in action. Since I'd read about Tramshed in CLASS Magazine, I was really there to have a tipple or two. Full marks for a well-done negroni - it's the first time I can recall having one served with balled ice (a la certain sazeracs). The house cocktail I sampled later on, the Dizzee Marmalade featuring rye and tea ended up being a bit sweeter than I'd normally take my drinks, yet appreciably well-balanced. Whoever's behind their cocktail program has solid chops.And as far as the food goes, it's quite simple: chicken or steak (as indicated by their website URL) and various salads and sides. I especially liked the heritage tomato salad, but I'm a sucker for a simple, refreshing nightshade. Ask me about the heirloom tomato stand at a wedding I attended last year. I still can't get over it. And the chicken is truly an awe-inspiring visual when it's delivered. If you're fond of phoenix claws (fong dzua), you won't want to miss out. Crispy, flavourful skin coated tender, juicy meat which you carve yourself. Conveniently, a spoon is provided so you can drizzle drippings all over your meat as well. And as if that wasn't gluttonous enough, the bowl of chips that came with our bird was enough to defeat two hearty eaters.Whilst I'm not sure that I'd be able to have meat and potatoes served as simply as Tramshed's more than once or twice a month, I fully appreciate that it's a clever concept. I'd certainly take tourists here for some brilliant British fare. I -would- come back again and again for those bar bites and drinks, though. It'll be interesting to compare against Hawksmoor's new bar in Spitalfields - anyone want to research with me?",

I would have to say the highlight was the sauteed side of mushrooms. \u00a0If anything, this would be worth going back for. Chips were good and the way they should be \u00a0- crispy on the outside with just the right soft mushiness on the inside.Desserts were lackluster. \u00a0I tried the salted caramel fondue with marshmallows and donuts - it was ok. \u00a0Slightly cheesy presentation. flavours were standard but nothing to write home about. \u00a0Someone else had the apple pie which looked fine but again, nothing amazing.Decent wine list with some good lower priced options. \u00a0We had a Malbec for about \u00a330/bottle.Overall, it was a good meal. \u00a0Amazing? No. \u00a0But consistently good, albeit quite pricey. \u00a0However, it was a great chance to see a Damien Hirst cow. \u00a0His artwork is overrated but I did see the wow factor about the cow. \u00a0How on earth did he do that?!?",

    "text": "I have always wanted to try out the Tramshed since I work nearby, but haven't been due to the thought that it might cost an arm or a leg. \u00a0Well, recently I've discovered that they have a special Lunch menu. \u00a0They have a 2 course express lunch or alternatively you can also choose from a lunch special sandwich menu, where you can sample (and I do mean sample based on portion size) the 2 (only) 2 items that they do, chicken or steak, in sandwich form.Obviously if you do go for the lunch menu you won't be getting the full experience of the wow factor / presentation of the chicken / steak, you'll just have to watch and drool when other tables order it. \u00a0So we went for the cock and bull, which is a half chicken & half steak sandwich with fries on the side. \u00a0While the portion size was a bit on the small side, and the sandwich filling (the GOOD stuff) was somewhat little (here I mention the word sample again), the bits we did get were absolutely delicious... and has done its job perfectly of luring me back soon for a full meal.I'd highly recommend anyone who's unsure about this place to try out their lunch menu to 'test the water' or if you are a big chicken/steak fan.. dive right into the full menu.PS - Vege options available :)",

I never imagined I would see chicken feet on a table outside of a Chinese restaurant. The chicken was okay and possibly a bit plain. It comes with a couple of gravy options to add some flavor. Some reviewers said their chicken was dry but ours was fine. The fries that come with the chicken were perfect though!We also tried the artichoke, bacon and soft cooked egg salad and some buttered winter greens. The portions for these items were quite small and the salad was excessively salty. The buttered winter greens looked quite sad. It was a few types of leaves and really just looked like someone washed a few pieces of lettuce and put them on a plate.",

That doesn't stop with the decor - the food is the same.I went with a group of about 10 coworkers celebrating a great year, and ordered one of two dishes - the porterhouse or the chicken. I went with the porterhouse but by the end of the meal I wished I had ordered the chicken.I had the the croquettes as a starter and it was a pretty solid choice - I would recommend it.The porterhouse came, and IT WAS HUGE! Served on a cutting board, I wasn't sure how my colleague and I were going to finish it. The meat was well cooked, but the fat had a crispy texture and tasted like no fat I've ever had before - it wasn't what I would call pleasant, though it wasn't non-pleasant either... it was just different. Unsure of what to make of it, I avoided as much of the fat as I could. The meat was a tad dry, but I'm being nit-picky.I tried another colleagues' chicken (which also has an amazing presentation), and that was spot on. Well cooked with good seasoning and moistness. The fries also soak up a bit of the chicken grease and tastes amazing. I helped myself to a bit more than I should have, but I knew that the chicken would have been the right choice for me - and not the porterhouse. Lesson learned. Next time, I'm going for the chicken.",

    "text": "\"I like chicken, I like liver, Tramshed Tramshed please deliver!\"I'd been avoiding Tramshed because I hear it gets busy. But we needed a place to grab a bite in the area (stupid Shoreditch) before going to have some Whisky, so I thought, \"Why not?\" So I booked, and I booked for fairly early.I think the booking probably wasn't necessary, when I arrived (half hour after my booking thanks to someone who needed emergency services on the Northern line) the place was empty except for Nava who had been waiting patiently for me.Anyway, we started out with a chicken shot and a beef shot (each). The chicken shot was okay, afterwards we told them maybe a bit of salt would help. The beef shot was awesome. Almost bloody Mary-like. I then had a grown-up iced tea which was pretty tasty.We had chicken liver pate on a Yorkshire pudding. Brilliant! The Yorkshire was super crispy and the pate was really delicious. We also had a sharing chicken served with amazing fries and sides of mushrooms (awesome) and onion rings (called fried onions on the menu). Everything was really tasty. The chicken was slightly dry, but the gravy was delicious and moistened it up a bit. But it was much tastier than other chicken venues I've been to where the chicken was moist, but bland. They also served everything with FOUR dipping sauces: Ketchup, mayonnaise, spicy English mustard and a mint pesto. Fun with dipping sauces. We were running late, so we skipped on dessert.The venue is cool. Ground floor toilets rock, and it's just a big warehousey place with awesome commissioned art pieces. (Cow and Chicken? AWESOMESAUCE!) There's also a \"painting\" in the men's toilet of two naked ladies. But it's not really a painting because at one point one woman moved! Clever bit of video work there.At one point Nava was concerned that we didn't fit in because we didn't have giant mustaches we could twirl. It's definitely a hipster sort of place, but I'm willing to forgive it due to delicious food. It's totally different and cool to like a place based on the how awesome the food is right, and not to like it just because it's cool to?I was tempted to add a fifth star because they use Ozone coffee. Anywhere that uses Ozone coffee deserves a higher rating in my opinion. So yeah, I'll be back. To try the beef. I hope it's as good as the chicken.",

    "text": "I am giving Tramshed a 3.5 stars to be precise.Place: beautiful and spacious. Very relaxed and friendly. I especially like the cow and chicken theme throughout the place.Service: Just okay. Semi-friendly and Semi attentive. basically waitresses doing their basic job requirements.Food: I had the chicken with some side orders and a burger. The chicken part was just okay, the stuffing was amazing. The burger is just okay as well. The best part of the meal was frankly the fries as they were delicious and plenty!Price: We spent about \u00a320 per person including drinks and tip. Our bellies were full so no complains there!I think I would be more impressed about Tramshed if I didn't read so much hype about it. I had a higher expectation before going in and my experience just didn't live up to that expectation.",

I almost wish it was a major attitude so that it would be novel or were actually nice / helpful. \u00a0 The beer is below average.. you expect some well curated crafty selection but instead you get some rebranding thing with the owners name in huge capital letters. \u00a0And finally the food always underwhelms at an overwhelming price. \u00a0I ordered the 'rib' entr\u00e9e this weekend and literally got 1 beef rib and a small pile of carrots in mayonnaise.I wish they just did it better and were less dicky.",

    "text": "I finally feel qualified to give a review on Tramshed. After 3 dining experiences. First: stopped in for lunch a few months ago. Had the chicken over salad + a latte to cap it. All in all, a solid lunch, likely 3.5 stars. No complaints. Second: An all-out steak fest with a gal pal Wednesday night no reservations 7pm, seated at the bar, hot French waiter, lots of red wine, onion rings, garlic mushrooms, the works. 5 stars. Not only no complaints, ONLY RAVES. Raves from the rooftop. Raves that are heard by the chicken and the cow riding in the aquarium du fromeldahyde. Third: Dinner with another couple, Friday night 9pm. Busy. Round of cocktails (Twitter & Biste recommended), all seems to be going well, then service goes way south, way fast. Food is lovely. Garlic mushrooms make a command appearance, whole chicken, whole steak, leeks (great!) plus salad. Great place to share the larger portions. Plus desserts. The apple pie is the clear winner, the dark chocolate mousse even a bit too rich for my blood -- the blood of a chocolate loving madame. 3 stars. Don't ask for an Irish coffee. Ever. So I think we even out at 4 stars, solid. It's a great place. You'll likely need a reservation any time you wish to come, maybe except lunch (where they have a good set menu if you like). The service can be hit or miss. The food is basic in variety, but done well. There are many variations on chicken and steak. The sides are top notch, those garlic mushrooms make me sing in my sleep. It's a big, impressive space. I'll come back.",

    "text": "Quick glance:+ great for large group+ sharing plates are delicious+ good cocktails- priceyFull review:Tramshed reminds me of a German beer hall, except the cock and bull in formaldehyde which is probably not a hallmark of any beer halls I've been. We came in as a group of 10, and the set up of the venue is perfect for large parties. As part of the few sharers we ordered to start, we had a beer stick each, which is like apepperami-looking beef jerkey, except it's soft and tasty. For mains, we had a meat sharing plate, a whole chicken, some ribs, and bits and bobs. The whole chicken was impressive, stuck on a plinth with its juices running down to the tray of fries, and I was tickled that they've kept the claws of the chicken. The prices are a bit on the high side (\u00a330 for the whole chicken, \u00a380 for a porterhouse to share) but the food is great and atmosphere fun, especially if you come in as a big group.",

As we asked for the bill, mentioning the food was a little less than...the manager proceeded to launch a full fledged argument at the table, stating no one checks on guests because it's simply \"not what we do here\". Oh? Yet for a meal of 2 plates and cocktails there was an automatic service charge added with no hesitation. I've never left a restaurant who acted like they've done me a favor by letting me eat there.Rude, unprofessional and unreasonable at best. Save yourself and go to a Hawksmoor.",

Yorkshire pudding - pate was whipped, smooth and fabulous with the popover bread.Croquettes - delicious with the mustardy/mayo sauce it came with. Half roasted chicken - very tasty and just enough for the both of us. We saw couples getting ONLY the whole roasted chicken and it was too much for them to finish. I personally like to have a variety of flavors so I was happy with our selection of dishes. The half portion and the whole portions both come with chips. Onion Rings - not usually a fan of onion rings because they usually end up soggy. These were so crispy even to the last bite. Very delicious, one of my favorites!Salad - came with a light mustard vinaigrette. I always need some greens or veggies with my meal.Didn't get dessert this time but I will definitely come back to try it.",

There is some choice for starters, but mains can be either chicken or beef. Very good chicken. Very good beef.Dry-aged (Himalayan salt-chamber you instantly guessed of course). And we all presume a Josper oven is used to give the chicken the crisp and the beef the crust.At one end of the room, a big tank filled with formaldehyde contains a young cow with a rooster on its head. Very live-like. Bit sad. Guilt disappears with every single chew.Pleasant service. Real mayonaise. Underwhelming chips. Who cares.I'm a fan...",

I tried the whole roast chicken others in my group had and this was tasty but nothing special. The salted caramel fondue and cheesecake both lacked any subtlety. My partner said his chicken burger was basic and the house wine was poor but still pricey. Hugely overpriced for what it is.",

Sorry to have missed the Yoorkshire pudding tho. Lots of cool stuff in the Hoxton Sq. area but glad we found this spot.",

So if you need to be in and out and back to the office in an hour, I would not recommend trying to get lunch here.That criticism aside, the food was pretty good - nice steak salad and chicken burger (2 courses at \u00a39.95). The chicken burger came with an interesting lemony (one friend thought borderline lemon curd-ish) sauce and delicious chips. The apple pie dessert (which you could have instead of the starter) looked good and was also quite big.There is a really ugly painting at one end of the restaurant that upset me. Also, it was really cold. I liked the freestanding sinks in the loos though.",

Instead of being apologetic, they were annoyed when it was sent back. After our mains, they then offered and served us another bottle of wine. We were then promptly asked us to vacate the table 10 minutes later. When we said we'd actually like to stay and finish the wine, and have a desert, I was harassed by a rude door-woman who was trying to 'prove to me' that they only took 2 hour reservations. Why serve us a bottle of wine, if you wanted the table back within 10 minutes? Horrible experience.",

    "text": "There's a real full-sized cow, with a rooster on its back, suspended above the dining room. If this is what you're looking for in a dining experience, then this Hix restaurant will deliver for you.Don't worry; the cow and rooster aren't alive. It's a Damien Hirst piece, a fitting ode to this steak and chicken restaurant. It seems morbid, but it's really awesome (kind of like their chicken presentation.)This is one of three memorable things about this restaurant that will stick with me. Another being the chicken itself.I love Yorkshire pudding and ordered theirs served with the whipped chicken livers. When it arrived, it looked really really dark for Yorkshire pudding - and was impressively shaped like a hatbox. Once I broke \u00a0it open, it was fine -- just crisper than I'm used to. To accompany the chicken, we had the mushrooms and the creamed spinach. My guy loved the spinach but I found both too salty for me. Memorable thing #2 arrived with the sides: the chicken.It's served whole and upside down on a spit, its little feet still intact and looking DELICIOUS. The server cuts off the feet and I volunteer my plate up. Great flavoring (salty) and crispy! I had to tap out early on the rest of chicken and french fries due to the salt but what I ate was good. Then comes memorable thing #3. The server brings out a steak to carve at the table next to us. He's slicing the steak and whoopsie daisy! the steak piece falls on the floor. Not missing a beat, the floor manager arrives and calmly says, \"Another steak will be brought out to you shortly. Medium-rare, right?\" It was pretty classy how it was handled; no panic, no fingerpointing at the server -- so great. The pair at the table are not bothered in the slightest. A second steak arrives and though they fight the good fight, soon the gentleman said to us, \"We are stuffed! Would you like this piece of steak?\" He hands my husband a huge chunk of steak, which my husband tries to politely decline, but I can see his mouth watering. The man insists and we end up talking with them throughout the meal. A common theme in London, which I sorely miss already.",

    "text": "This restaurant has been on my list pretty much since I moved to London, but somehow I never got around to it. I just knew about the formaldehyde cow, which people have mentioned in conversations about Damien Hirst. But when a friend was visiting and said he wanted steak, this was on our shortlist and we booked it after finding that every Hawksmoor in town was full. It's a very airy, sprawling space, \u00a0almost a warehouse feel. We have one of the booths to the side of the restaurant, which sat the 5 of us comfortably and could have even fit in a few more people. We ordered some starters, including the Korean fried chicken, beefballs, croquettes, and the Yorkshire pudding with whipped chicken livers. The meat ones were rather forgettable, but the Yorkshire pudding was super interesting and would recommend. For the mains, we shared the Shoreditch strip joint, which was possibly the largest piece of meat I have ever been served. It's 1.4kg of pure meat, for 5-6 to share, and we definitely had leftovers. It comes with chips and salad, so we were basically all set. They had a confusing system of where they told us the meat usually comes out one grade rarer than what you ordered, so we went for medium. When we got it, there was definitely a spectrum among the different parts of the piece from medium rare to medium, so hopefully among a group you can sort out your various preferences. On our way out, we saw some very good looking grilled whole chicken, so that also seems to be a popular dish. The food here isn't anything fancy, but they do the classics well.",

It's a massive modernized farm looking room with a huge giant aquarium looking thing with a cow and chicken. BUT IS IT REAL? I don't know. Probably. Whatever. So, we came here with friends because they wanted to and yes we're vegetarian so sadly I can only speak for the vegetarian food, but HEY! We were pretty impressed that they offered another menu for us. But you have to ask for it. The butternut squash and sweet potato curry is very good with warm basmati rice and fried onions. Very good. The fries are also addicting and they give you multiple dipping options (but the portions are small so ask for extra!). Husband got the aubergine burger which was also nice. All of our friends go the steak which they said was good. The service was excellent and very understanding because we had one person in the party who kept disappearing so it was throwing off the ordering process. They were really accommodating though and awesome.",

It wasn't very busy when we came, and huge and spacious, which is refreshing for shoreditch, you get the choice of cow, or chicken, but I'm guessing you got that already, but the menu is full enough. The chips are well seasoned, as is the meat, and although I have had better, it was still pretty damn good taste wise, and cooked perfectly. Maybe we came on a good day? I don't know.Our waitress was fab, heard me panicking about my phone and offered to charge it, was quick and polite.I think this place is best for a big late lunch, meat and a big bottle of reasonable red with an old friend you can share with (the fondue, do it), and not feel judged when you eat a whole chicken face planting a bowl of chips in one sitting.",

We all managed a long table together and were in the very capable hands of a very charming waiter named Charlie, who was able to keep up with us all night! We got the Yorkshire pudding with whipped chicken liver, the Beefballs & the Cock 'n' Bull croquettes. Although all were good, the popular vote went to the Yorkshire pudding/chicken liver combo - just the right amount of lightness in the pudding and the whipped liver. Amazing, just order it.Then, as a group, we ordered 2 of the Indian Rock chickens with chips and 2 orders of the sirloin. Somehow, I worried there wouldn't be enough chips for the table and Charlie assured me there would be plenty. I don't know why I ever doubted him, though perhaps he should have mentioned he would bring 2 additional BOWLS of chips on the side.Warning: the chicken is not for the faint of heart - it comes to the table looking slightly monstrous, with it's feet sticking up. Also, don't forget about the stuffing inside - delicious. And the steak. Oh, that steak. Cooked to medium to appease everyone at the table, it was still incredibly moist, perfectly charred on the outside... just so incredible. Somehow, after all that, we still had room for dessert. So, we turned to the salted caramel fondue, which is served with marshmallows and doughnuts. This, perhaps obviously, is very, VERY sweet. I like my desserts, but I found this to be just a little TOO sweet for me. And through it all, Charlie was attentive AND entertaining - I made sure to let the manager know as well. The art, as I'm sure you've already read about/seen pictures of, is different. Divisive, perhaps, and YES IT'S REAL, but certainly sparks a conversation.",

The menu has not changed either - great chicken and steak....Clearly a victim of their success :1. They did not put any thinking into how to (slightly) evolve their offering for returning customers and the changing Shoreditch food scene2. The service was simply awful despite the restaurant being at 20% capacity - it was slow, we had to ask for our drinks 3 times, the waiter advised us to take a dish that..... was not on the menu anymore etc.Again - the food was good as always but they are clearly sitting on their laurels !",

    "text": "In general I prefer to avoid giving bad reviews but I was actually quite disappointed with Tramshed. While the food was reasonably good, the service was very poor which is the primary reason for dropping to 2 stars. Service was very slow, a member of my party waited 20 minutes for a Mojito, and the two other cocktails we ordered took far longer than normal. Our server (Matas) had absolutely dreadful customer service skills. We were quite reasonably made aware our table would be required at 9.30 for another booking - we arrived at 7pm for a 7.30 reservation so as to ensure we weren't delayed. Now, our server came and asked if we were ready to order after about 2 minutes of being sat at the table - we asked for \"another couple of minutes\" to look over the menus. He didn't revisit the table for 20 minutes. The consistent poor service thoughout the meal meant when we got round to our final course Matas started to rush us. Though not in a remotely polite way, he was blunt and unapologetic for his shoddy service. This meant the end of our meal with very rushed and not our fault and actually made it quite unlikely that any of our party will return again. The food was good in general, probably 3.5-4/5 stars, though the service left us with a bad view of our Tramshed experience which brought my overall review rating down to 2 stars. While our table was at peak time on a Saturday evening, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a certain level of customer service.",

Nothing was particularly bad but nothing particularly good - here's my roundup. * The rib eye steak at \u00a322 was just not that great, I've had much much better steaks at lower prices and it was just lacking taste. * The onion rings were so crispy they were almost inedible. * The spinach side was so creamy and had an overpowering taste of something that didn't work (I want to say nutmeg...maybe??) that it was just a bit over the top. * Beer selection was very poor - the 'Hix Pale Ale' was basically old man bitter at \u00a36.50 a bottle which is stupidly overpriced and tasted flat... I can understand Mark Hix wanting to get his name on a beer if it's his restaurant but surely put it on something decent!I had high hopes but unfortunately didn't see much to want to come back which is a shame as I know some friends have rated it highly.",

    "text": "Three nights ago I visited Mark Hix's latest restaurant, The Tramshed, which opened on 23rd May in Shoreditch. It was buzzing as I entered, a large warehouse-esque space with double volume walls crowned with a pitched green roof. Hix himself explained: \"I just wanted it to be very, very simple ... The expanse of this space really lent itself to simple dining.\" Exactly. It's that successful recipe of mixing design and food, a polygamous marriage between architecture, creativity and simplicity in taste (using both meanings of the word). The restaurant orchestrates a great vibe in this way, not to mention with the added quirkiness of the large Damien Hirst sculpture 'Cock and Bull' (a cow and cockerel preserved in a steel and glass tank of formaldehyde) that watches over diners from its 4 metre high pedestal at the centre of the room.The menu really is simple: either steak or chicken. There are also three starters, which come together at \u00a38 per head. We opted to try these: Yorkshire Pudding with Whipped Chicken Livers, Ham Hock with Peas and Goat's Curd with Beetroot Pur\u00e9 and Walnuts. The Whipped Chicken Livers was a delicious mousse, like a smooth and velvety p\u00e2t\u00e9 infused with flavour. The Yorkshire Pudding would have been better heated, instead it was cold and spongy without a tantalising crisp to its golden exterior. The Ham Hock was a great little dish, with the meat being tender and complimenting its bed of green peas mixed with mustard. The Goat's Curd was thick and creamy, but the beetroot beneath it was merely a pool of cold soup. Its texture was too thin, meaning the third dimension of taste added by the toasted walnuts was lost in the dish, which did not hold well together.As for mains, two of us opted for the whole Roast Wooley Park Farm Free-range Chicken and Chips (\u00a325.00), one of us chose the Glenarm Sirloin Steak and Chips (\u00a320 for 250g) and another went for the Chicken Salad (\u00a313.50). Unfortunately, the latter never came. It did show up on the bill, however, and once we pointed this out our server was duly apologetic and offered to make our desserts complimentary. Minus this glitch, the service was excellent, very friendly and swift - especially for a week-young restaurant.Back to the food - the chicken comes positioned vertically for ease of carving and, of course, theatricality. It was quite a sight to behold these poultry being ferried to and fro, legs up in the air like cancan dancers. The waitress offered to carve it for us, as shown in the photo below. The seasoning was delicious, especially the gravy juice at the bottom of the plate. The breast itself was not the most moist chicken breast I have had, although it is often drier that the leg, but the quality of the meat was there for tasting. The leg was the most enjoyable part and extremely supple. The unique presentation of the vertical chicken also allows for a 360 attack, permitting everyone on the table to dig in and also enabling you to get to every nook and cranny. The skin on the 'underside' of the bird, for example, is one of my favourite bits and it was extremely easy to access, while tasting just as crispy, thick and seasoning-encrusted as it should be. Since the whole chicken serves up to 3 people, my companion who ordered the MIA Chicken Salad was thankfully well and truly stuffed by the end of our meal.I am told the steak was not the tenderest in the history of steak tasting. It was, however, cooked as requested and retained a good meaty flavour. Both dishes come with chips in the form of French fries. If I'm being pedantic, which of course I am - especially with chips - they were not hot enough upon arriving to the table. Temperature is crucial when it comes to fries! They did taste good, but for personal preference they could also have been slightly more cooked to give at least a hint of crunch to their exterior.We ordered both available side dishes: the Garden Salad (\u00a34.25), which was fantastically fresh with a really tasty dressing, and the Suffolk Crown Asparagus (\u00a35.25), which were skilfully cooked to retain a gentle crunch and were a really great accompaniment to the meats.Merging visual culture and culinary delights in one space works wonderfully here and, as I iterated at the beginning of this piece, it is a harmonious marriage that translates into a guaranteed great night of food, drink and socialising. The concept is focused, the dishes are great, the service is efficient, the place is cool. The future is bright for The Tramshed.",

The restaurant is tucked away in one of the side streets in Shore Ditch, but easy enough to find.Drinks are good and the starters are yummy. If you can, get the 3 for 10 pound deal. We got the Yorkshire pudding, onions rings, and the croquettes. They were yummy, but they weren't piping hot. Seemed like they had all the starters on standby, but aside from that...very tasty.For two people, you can just order the 500g sirloin and it comes with fries (chips). We got a side of the minted peas. Very nice and refreshing! The steak was good, but I think the winning dish would be the roasted chicken. It's a show stopper when the waiters wall by with it.Again, the staff was very attentive and great dining experience. Don't forget to admire the cow in the tank right above the restaurant.",
