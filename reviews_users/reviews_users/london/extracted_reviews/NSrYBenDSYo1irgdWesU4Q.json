If you can get more than 6 people they will usually let you have a room to yourself. The wines are a bit daunting, and the wine list is exceptionally good, but there is always a Portugese red or simmilar that is very good and it's the cheapest wine! Look also to Alsace.And at the end you get to pig out on the petite fleurs. The staff always make you feel welcome and relaxed and take a genuine interest in your enjoyment & comfort and you feel they are rewarded too.Marcus Eaves has settled in and simply shines!A great place to 'destroy' the afternoon when you need a break.",

It is in my view one of the best restaurants of it's type in the UK an equal to The Square and Gordon Ramsey at Royal Hospital Road. One feels that each dish hs been carefully developed and constructed like a fine oil painting - everything on the plate has a purpose and contributes to the whole. The wine list is vey well chosen with a particulary good selection of red Burgundies.",

    "text": "This is the best tasting menu I've had in London so far. It's french and two star Michelin rated. This is the first restaurant while in London that I have eaten everything, like licked my plate clean everything (except I didn't finish the brie because I was trying to pace myself for dessert). The service is impeccable as well. Here is what I had:They offered me juice after I declined the wine so I went with tomato and got it spicy. It tasted and felt like I was drinking shrimp cocktail sauce. Which isn't bad if I'm sipping it, but I usually gulp down tomato juice pretty quick so my first taste was very powerful.Selection of Canapes - Beautiful presentation and it tasted as good as it looked. I'm not sure what I ate, but it was all fantastic. I spilled about 3 eggs of caviar onto the bottom charger plate (the one thats there for decoration, that you never actually eat off of) and they instantly changed it to a new clean one.Bacon roll - wow what a great bread selection. Of course I had to get the bacon roll! It looked like a mini cinnamon roll, minus the frosting and with bacon sprinkled on top instead of cinnamon. And to make this moment even more epic for me, a newlywed Chinese couple just sat and they have british accents! I still can't get used to asian people with british accents.Yellowtail Tare Tare - delicious! Had crunchy stuff on top and was seasoned differently than most restaurants yellowtail. It was a great change.Scallops with purple cauliflower - It was good for scallops (sorry scallop lovers out there, I just think they always taste plain)Pan Fried Foie Gras on top of one big piece of ravioli filled with beans and bits of bacon. On top of the foie gras was crispy tempura-esque veggies. They poured a consume on top and it just made the dish. I think this is the best foie gras dish I've ever had.John Dory encrusted with green powder topped with fennel foam and squid on the side. - It was good, a little plain.Lamb - It had those tiny tart red european fruits in it along with some kind of tasty sauce. The fruit added a little zing that brought the dish together very nicely.Cheese - two kinds (didn't catch the name of the first one and brie) came with these awesome paper thin crackers.Blueberries wrapped in cantaloupe with ice cream and sweet thick lime juice poured on top. It was sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds that just made it crazy good. Wish this dish was bigger.Bitter sweet chocolate tart, ice cream and macadamia nut cream, plus two macadamia nuts (caramelized on the outside). Loved it!green tea(I don't drink coffee) and petits fours - wow 6 little treats and I took them all down. It always came with this paper thing sweet crispy things. I don't know what they are or called, but they go perfectly with tea.I never do the wine tasting with the menu because I'm such a light weight, but hearing the other people in the restaurant, it seems like a good one here. They make it a guessing game for you. They don't tell you what kind and where its from until the end of the course. So if you are a wino you should go for it.anitaeat.com",

Food was perfection itself- beautifully presented, wonderfully tasty and obviously cared for ! Wines they suggested were also perfect and all round service fantastic, attentive without being intrusive. Worthy of their 2 stars and will certainly go back although rather expensive at \u00a3200+ per head. The booking arrangements and providing card details is I know becoming more common amongst such restaurants but doesn't mean I have to like it as immediately implies no trust in relationship.........otherwise a great expereince",

    "text": "My first London Michelin Star dining experience. (Lunch) The prix fixe menu was nice however I requested a vegetarian option. Neither main appealed to my palate today however the vegetarian option was a hit. (sometimes can be a miss since it's mushrooms, mushrooms and more mushrooms) Not that I don't like them, just too much of a good thing rule. Anyway, our reservation was at 1pm... we departed at 4pm and yes, this was a work luncheon. Sooooo... on a Friday this wasn't too big of a deal however it'd been nice if they would have recognized that we would have like to kept things at a bit of a timelier pace. The food was very nice. Our canap\u00e9s came out right away, a goats cheese pastry accompanied by fried croquette and mushroom. My meal consisted of a delightful risotto and truffle topped with spinach and Romano cheese. ABSOLUTELY delicious! The main arrived and honestly I was quite disappointed. Of course it was presented beautifully and taste just fine but purple broccoli and roasted onions in a cream sauce left me longing for a bit more. Thank goodness their breads are fantastic. The walnut wheat is by far my favorite. As for wines we selected a nice South African Chenin Blanc as well as a New Zealand Riesling for those who appreciate a sweeter taste. A nice palate cleanser arrived with lemon oil base over a sorbet covered by a unique pink gel. I failed to catch what it was called but it was good. The dessert arrived, a panna cotta sandwiched between a shortbread topped with a light cinnamon ice cream. It was nice however the \"congealed\" texture of this panna cotta was a bit odd. It giggled like Jell-o (a popular and inexpensive American gelatin product.) Once we finished our cafe, espressos and teas arrived along with some parting sweets... all quite tasty however we were \"done\" and ready to depart. The private room we were in was warm. I'm totally an ambience person and my first impression of this room was 1980's board room. I expected Joan Collins to sashay in with broad shoulder pads and strike a pose. The leather chairs were in horrible shape. Personally I'd be embarrassed to serve anyone in my house if my furniture looked that way. After our 3 hour lunch my feeling was it's good and I'd return but keeping a few things in mind. Also, my colleague told me they have a wonderful tasting menu in the evenings. It's on the list to try again however it'll be planned as an event, not just dinner. So in the end this American Southerner says, bon appetite, y'all!",

The food was exquisite, in both flavour and presentation. For me, my starter of quail breasts stood out slightly over my main of lamb, whereas my wife preferred her main of monkfish over her starter of scallops. These preferences were relative of course - it was all of the highest quality. We agreed that It was with the desserts that the restaurant excelled itself though. My hazelnut mousse was simply the best dessert I've ever tasted, and my wife had similar feelings about her chocolate tart, a signature dish of the chef, Shane Osborn. Top marks too to the sommelier for his wine recommendation, and the service was amazing. Watching the choreography of it was almost as much of a treat as the food!",

The duck main course was absolutely tasteless. I ordered the classic wine flight to match the big degustation menu; the first 3 whites were just average wines, then they brought a red that was bad, I complained and they brought a glass of a third rate half bottle bordeaux , I complained again saying that it was below standards for a cost of 90 pounds for the flight. Then, they woke up and brought me 4 glasses of different good desert wines. Desert was easily forgetable. Really the cooking at Pied a Terre is in a sad situation. For the price you can eat much better at several places at London. I had a lunch at the National Gallery museum restaurant which was a lot more flavourfull than anything at Pied a Terre.",

Service on the phone was prompt and efficient and this was carried through to the restaurant. The atmosphere was refined but friendly and not stuffy despite the restaurant being only 1 of a few in the capital to hold 2 coveted Michelin stars. We even felt able to asak one of the waiters whether anyone ever told him that he looked like Thierry Henry (French soccer player) to whhich the answer was \"Not today!\"As is our habit with new restaurants, we went for the tasting menu, whicih allows us to sample more courses and the kitchen to showcase what it thinks are its best dishes.It was one of the best meals I had last year. I think chef Osborn's style can best be described as modern European with very European ingredients but given his own Pacific Rim twist. The flavours are clearly defined with a few surprises breaking through some classic flavour combinations.My favourite dishes were the scallop \"ceviche\" and the cumin crusted rump of salt marsh lamb. The scallops were so sweet and the kitchen didn't drown this important taste with too much acidity. The lamb was cooked to medium rare perfection, retaining its tenderness and moistness and was given a hint of Middle Eastern exoticism with the spicing.I had a lovely glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and my sister was very happy with her glass of white. The wine list looked impressive.I would be very happy to return for my 50th birthday!",

It was time to upgrade and try the mothership :) And it was worth it! I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch there!- the restaurant itself is quite small, but it's charming. Very cosy and classy interior that gives it a soft atmosphere. It's made with a lot of taste, makes you feel comfortable, with a few touches of color here and there.- the staff is smily and very nice. They are not overwhelming, but still very attentive and eager to make sure you are enjoying yourself. The sommelier was especially fun and friendly, joking with us about the wine.- the food! BRILLIANT! we had the lunch menu. It started with a choice of butter (salty or not) and bread (the parmesan is to die for!), then mise-en-bouches (the gnocchi with tomato and parmesan was so yummy!!!). I had the prawn carpaccio with apples and sesame as a starter. Very surprising, but in a positive way. When it came, I wasn't sure what I had ordered. But it tasted very nice. An unusual, but pleasing combinations of flavours. Maybe a little too heavy on the sesame side for me. Then I had the rabbit. It was DELICIOUS. So tender. So packed with flavours. And the red spanish wine I had, was stunning with it. Then came the pre-dessert, a sweet lemony light creme/mousse. Refreshing. For dessert, I had the mascarpone & nectarine tart. I need the recipe. It was heavenly good. Fresh, rich and crispy. And finally, the petits fours to end this feast (my fav was the cannele, still warm from the oven!).- the manager must be a smart & kind person. A 2-stars michelin restaurant that offers a \u00a323 lunch menu (starter+main) is beyond great! The whole experience of a high-class restaurant, with incredible creativity and yum-factor deserves a big warm hug. It allows everyone to experience the worlds of haute cuisine, and this is something to be noted :)))",

I had heard equally fantastic thoughts about L'autre pied (their sister restaurant - I have not been there), and so thought this should be an amazing meal. The venue is quite beautiful. Courteous staff provide proper yet comfortable service in a small, well lit room. I didn't find the booth to be very comfortable, but that's ok. The wine list was very impressive, and we ordered the least expensive Chateauneuf-du-pape with great success.We did the tasting menu, hoping to get the most complete experience. Everything was nicely made and beautifully presented, but nothing was really inspiring or memorable. The foie gras, which I looked forward to most, was properly cooked, but, again, just sort of plain and flat. Best course was the lamb, beautifully prepared and well seasoned, and the only memorable flavor for me, other than the petits fours.I give full credit for their petits fours, especially the macaroons. These proved those most lasting impression for me, and about the only thing that would bring me back (I wish they sold them on their own). As before, everything was beautiful, and I cannot say anything was done improperly, but for a Michelin two-star charging ninety pounds for a tasting menu, I can't say I walked out happy. I regard it as a one-star, based primarily on the refined service and setting, coupled with the competence of the cuisine, but to get to two, I think a smattering of inspirational flavors should be required, and I think I should leave wanting to return, which I didn't.",

    "text": "Round 4: Seared Duck Foie Gras with Glazed Endive, Pumpkin and Orange Pur\u00e9e, White Balsamic GelMy biggest worry with foie gras is that instead of rich meatiness you get overwhelmingly oily tastes. Not so here. The foie gras was full of high notes conjuring images of luxury and decadence. After all, there are few dishes as decadent as foie gras, even the saying the name makes you feel a bit elite. This was well supported by the full mouth feel of the dish. The glazed endive provided the necessary crunch although I couldn't see an easy way to cut it and popped it in my mouth alone. Tasty, but lacking the ability to tie in with other elements. The puree was a bit random and again tasty but without any real link to everything else. In addition, the bread provided with the foie gras was woefully insufficient. Overall, individually the elements were brilliant but this is a case where the whole is less than the sum of the parts.Round 5; Poached Fillet of Halibut with Wet Walnut Crust, Saut\u00e9ed Jerusalem Artichokes and LovageThis might have been one of my favourite dishes on the menu. The fish was cooked perfectly and just on the right edge of done which resulted in a moist offering that melted in your mouth. Again, good contrasting textures provided by the walnut crust (what a wet crust is and how it differs from a dry crust I don't know) and saut\u00e9ed artichokes. I normally see asparagus with this type of dish but the artichokes provided the same flavor group while changing the visual lines of the plate. The fish is a longish line and asparagus continues this trend whereas the artichokes provide a more circular design that was visually pleasing.Round 6: Loin of Berkshire Venison with Golden Cauliflower, Glazed Herefordshire Snails and Red Wine JusI love venison. I love the rich gamey flavor and the tenderness of the meat. This didn't disappoint and the seared loin was perfectly done. It's easy to overcook or undercook venison and leave it just too tough to easy eat. This was tender enough to cut with a butter knife (and the wickedly sharp curved blades provided for the course had no problem at all) and full of juicy goodness. However, as good as the meat was, it paled in comparison to the flavours of the jus. I even asked for more bread to mop it up. I did my best to behave in a posh manner as befitting the restaurant, but sometimes you just gotta go for it and wipe your plate clean.Round 7: Cheese selectionWe were given a selection of 3 cheeses. One was a mild goat's cheese, one a fairly middle of the road cow's milk cheese, and a sharp blue stilton. A selection of crisp flatbreads were provided which are not very tidy or really suitable for cheese. The goat's cheese was spectacular and I could have had that all night. The cow's milk cheese was fairly unmemorable and the stilton a bit much given the richness of the dishes so far. One of my friend's didn't want cheese and they graciously replaced it with a \u00a0treacle tart that had me a bit jealous. I was a bit disappointed we weren't able to choose from a selection of cheeses but overall it was perfectly adequate.Round 8: Pumpkin Panna Cotta with Confit Clementines and Orange Consomm\u00e9I've got to say I've never had a better panna cotta before. This was smooth and creamy and you could lose yourself in the silkiness of the dish. The clementines were a clever element and tied in nicely with the orange consomm\u00e9. Needless to say we scraped our dishes clean.Round 9: White Chocolate Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e with Blackberries and Lemon Leaf Ice CreamThe cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e was likewise soft and silky although I didn't get much of the white chocolate flavours. The tart blackberries provided a good contract from the sweetness of the brul\u00e9e. The ice cream was nice but nothing special. At this point we were stuffed but the end was almost upon us.Round 10: Coffee and petit foursAt this point, you need an espresso just to make it out of your seat. The coffee is good (not on par with Paris but close) although I fear they slightly burned the beans in ours. The petit fours (there are four of them nicely done) range from delicious to horrendous but I imagine that depends on your tastes (I personally don't like fruit gel filled chocolates) so I won't comment too much more on them.Hmm, well if you've made it this far, some other thoughts for you. I would say this was worth the price tag for the food. The atmosphere is quite relaxed so while good for catching up and perhaps a date, it's not the ideal spot if you plan on going out afterwards as you tend to be a bit sleepy by the end. Also, given the small size, if you are a bit loud you will dominate the scene. We were joking around as was the table behind us so we didn't notice it for a while. But when we took a break to eat at the same time as the other table, the restaurant was deathly quiet which highlighted the fact everyone else probably knew exactly what we were discussing. Good wine list - I'm outta space!",

We ate early, with a 6:30 booking, and were the first in the restaurant, but it started to get a little busier after about 45 minutes and was packed by the time we left. The staff went out of their way to accommodate a fussy eater in our party (coming up with a complete main course that wasn't even on the menu) and the food was very, very good. Fairly rich, French-style cooking, though that's to be expected, but still very enjoyable. Delicious bread (and very nice to see them offering more once we'd finished our first (and second, and third, and fourth!) portions and attentive service, though the white wine could have been put on ice by the end of the meal. Dinner service wasn't cheap, but some of the lunchtime and special offer menus look extremely good value for money.",

    "text": "We had an outstanding dinner here last night, as part of an early birthday present for my husband. We did the tasting menu with the wine accompaniment, which took around 4 hours or so, including the kir royales and olives at the beginning. We were seated in the small 4-table area at the front of the restaurant, and the service felt very personal and attentive the entire time. Doing the wine pairing was particularly fun, since the sommelier/waiter would have us eat a bit of the meal and drink a bit of the wine before he would reveal the region and name of the wine (each wine came from a different country). It sounds like that could be a little irksome, I know, but it was actually a great experience, with some easy guesses and some tough ones.In addition to the olives, we started with four amuse bouche, three cold and one hot. The flavors ranged from salty to sweet, which was a nice contrast. \u00a0Our first course was \"Pickled Cornish Mackerel with Shaved Fennel Salad, Roasted Baby Beetroots, Beetroot and Balsamic Gel,\" paired with (spoiler alert) a 2009 Muscadet Coteaux de la Loire. The mackerel completely tasted of the sea, while the earthy, sweet beetroot balanced the dish. The fennel was very subtle, and the balsamic gave it all a nice tang.Next, we had \"Pan-Fried Scottish Scallops with Baby Artichokes, Gremolata, Iberico Ham, Lemon Verbena Jus Gras,\" paired with a 2010 Gruner Veltliner (Hasel). This dish really upended my tasting expectations! I love Iberico Ham, but sometimes find it a bit \"fishy.\" Here, that fishy flavor fit in with the butter notes on the scallops, and the tartness of the lemon verbena. The \"Seared and Poached Foie Gras with a Ragout of Borlotti Beans, Fresh Peas, and Sauternes Consomme,\" with a 2009 Ribeiro (Vino do Campo) was next. This dish also screamed \"French classic\" from the menu, but was invigorated by the little touches of the chef. The foie gras was seared to perfection, and the beans and peas (in particular) brightened up the dish and balanced the heaviness of the foie gras. The fourth course was \"Pan-fried Monkfish with Morels, Baby Leeks, and Liquorice Sauce,\" with a 2009 Viognier-Chardonnay (Qupe, from CA), and the fifth course was \"Roasted Gressingham Duck Breast, Red Chard, Fresh Almonds, Cherry and Thyme Sauce,\" with a 2005 Quinto do Seival (from Brazil!). Both dishes were tender and rich, and the Brazilian wine was quite a surprise. Now we were in the home stretch - cheese, desserts, and petit fours. The only disappointment with the cheese course is that the cheeses were chosen for us, rather than letting us select from the awesome-looking cheese board. The wine to accompany the cheese was a 2008 Bonarda Cinco Tierras from Argentina. The first dessert was a tart and sweet \"Strawberry and Yoghurt Mousse with Fromage Frais Sorbet and (teeny tiny) Wild Strawberries\" (with a 2008 Malvasia Colli Piacentini from Italy), and the second dessert was a sweet and tart ;^) \"White Chocolate Creme Brulee with Kentish Raspberries and Lemon Leaf Ice Cream\" (with a 2008 Mulderbosch Sauv Blanc). Both desserts captured the fresh flavors of summer, with a nice rich counterpoint, sort of a dressed-up strawberries and cream. The meal then finished with coffee and tea and a tray of petit fours, all of which were little works of art. The nougat was my favorite, but all of the tiny tarts were so nice, too.I wish that I could come back here every week, it was so outstanding.",

    "text": "Full review on thehappinessprojectlondo\u2026  We had the tasting menu \u00a0the second ever time I've done this. At 10 courses, it was really far too much (I felt sick on the tube home from being over-stuffed) but it was the most exciting gastronomique experience of my life so far. The amuse bouche themselves were incredible, including a ginger foam thing that bubbled in the mouth and was so good I giggled. Starters included marinated Scallops with Brandade Mousse, Cauliflower and Truffle Salad, Lemon Oil and Baby Wood Sorrel \u00a0I'm allergic to scallops but they managed to make me something even better. Mains included cod and venison and the puddings seemed to go on forever. We loved the coffee and petit fours at the end (if only we could eat, or see, properly \u00a0see below). I don't regret doing the tasting menu \u00a0it was a wonderful experience and the food was original, experimental and delicious - but next time, I'd like to order a la carte. We also did the wine flight with this menu which meant a new wine for every course. The glasses are about half full, but still I was pretty tipsy by the end and the last few courses were a little hazy. However, it was really fun guessing the wine, there were some really interesting choices, and the whole experience sent us into giggling schoolchild mode. I loved how the chef and wine sommellier were both Aussies \u00a0shows how good Australian cuisine has become, meant that there was a lot of experimental cooking, and that the wine choices were eclectic - New World and non-French European as well as some good French wines. I loved how the French aristocrats asking the nationality of the chef were shocked \u00a0ha! It is also unlike other Michelin-starred restaurants, as you can book it through toptable. First downside is the money \u00a0if you do choose the taster menu plus wine flight, you're looking at around \u00a3170 each \u00a0ouch. Second downside is that it was filled with Eurotrash and bankers, and the atmosphere wasn't great even on a Saturday night \u00a0it didn't seem full of regulars or the cool crowd like the River Cafe",

Amuse-bouche included mac-and-cheese topped with truffle-oil infused sauce; probably the best use of truffle oil I've experienced. The mains were a beef course and a pork tenderloin. Beef was extremely flavourful and tender, and pork was cooked to perfection. \u00a0Breads included a marmite bread -- tasty and totally unique. Dessert was strawberry \"tiramisu\" with caramel-popcorn on top. It was delightful, as was the chocolate that came with the bill.The current menu is a bit Mediterranean-influenced, including oil (instead of butter) coming with the bread, and a small bowl of green olives. \u00a0The olives were inexplicably removed after I'd only eaten a few, altho the bread was left. I was planning to eat some more of the olives with the bread between main courses. \u00a0The service began stiffly, tho it warmed up as the meal went on. As compared to other Michelin-starred restaurants where I've eaten, the servers didn't seem perfectly coordinated here. It wasn't just the coordination -- somehow the personalities were slightly discordant. \u00a0However, the ma\u00eetre d' invited me to see the kitchen at the end of the meal and meet the chef (Asimakis Chaniotis). This made up for the initial stiffness and premature olive removal.The other reason I'm giving 4 versus 5 stars is that the restaurant is extremely cramped. I was seated in the front dining room (the back one is much larger). While well decorated (I loved the cracked glass and subdued wall colors), I felt cramped the whole meal. When I went upstairs to use the loo, that too was incredibly cramped. Overall, was almost claustrophobic, especially as the table cloth went all the way down to the floor and I could feel it over my legs during my meal.Total cost (October 2018) was US$61 for one (including service charge, a bottle of mineral water, and prix fixe lunch), which was an outstanding value. I just wish the setting had been more light / airy / roomy. (If you're a larger party, it's less likely you'd be seated in the tiny front dining room like I was.)FOOD 5/5SERVICE 4/5ATMOSPHERE 3/5VALUE 5/5TLDR: Top notch food with slightly stiff service presented in a cramped space.Could be better if... service less stiff from the beginning and (front) dining room less crowded.",

    "text": "I really wanted to try a Michelin-starred restaurant overseas, and though I would have loved to try something British, we ultimately decided on Pied-a-Terre due to its location and menu affordability. We stopped in here around 1pm, and the restaurant only had maybe one other pair there. From start to finish, it was definitely an interesting experience. Despite the fact that I was wearing a nice dress, I still felt kind of... awkward. I'm in my mid-20s, not wearing a designer outfit, just something simple and nice, and I felt like I was not supposed to be here. I wonder if that's how all Michelin restaurants are? Regardless of feeling that way, the waiters were lovely and attentive. I can never get used to someone tucking a napkin into my lap after I sit down, but I can appreciate that it was all a part of the aesthetic. Though our reservation was at 1pm, since we arrived a bit early, they let us sit down early. We chose the three course menu, which was interesting and delicious. As someone who is pretty obsessed with food, I was impressed with the flavors presented. They started us out with bread, and I know it's silly to mention, but dear god, that bread was fantastic. Crusty exterior, with a delicious, warm, flaky interior. Next was something served amuse-bouche (I believe; it was tiny and I can't remember it being mentioned on the menu), then a salad (weirdly enough, some of the bed dressing I've ever had in my whole dang life), the fish as a main, and a tiny lemon (I think?) mousse. Honestly, most of the food was portioned very small, but the flavors they packed were delicious.THE VERDICT:Overall, the food was delicious, the presentation beautiful if bemusing, and the service absolutely top notch. I believe the food was about 90 pounds for two, not including the tip. We spent a little over 2 hours here, leisurely enjoying the meal. So why 4 stars, you ask? Because I just felt absolutely uncomfortable the entire time. I know this is not a reflection of the food or the service, but it's something I still can't shake... Months later. Like I somehow didn't belong there, which is what stops me from truly loving the place.",

The atmosphere is intimate, and perfectly suited to romance or business discussions.The food--especially the tasting menus--is as good as any from London's other top rated restaurants. But the real difference at Pied a Terre is the wine service. Rather than simply selecting and pouring wines with each course, it is the restaurant's practice to offer a blind tasting, where the wine is poured first so you can taste it alone, then the course is served so you can see how it matches, and then you are asked to comment on the wine and (if you wish) guess what it is.We find this to be tremendous fun. It forges a camaraderie with the sommelier that sets the experience apart from all other fine dining experiences.",

    "text": "Wow!!I was taken here for my birthday December last year. I think from the moment we stepped in it was clear that we were not the usual clientele. But that only made the servers more wonderful to us. With every course the sommelier came over and spoke to us in terms we would understand explaining the wine to us and not making us feel uncomfortable at all. We had seven amazing courses. Truffle velout\u00e9 to start. Only one mouthful but bursting with flavour. Then deep fried mussels with a little basil jelly inside.Again bursting with flavour. Then pickled mackerel. Again just lovely, and I do not normally enjoy cold fish. But it was not overwhelming and the accompaniments worked so well. Then beef carpaccio with deep fried sweet breads. YUM!! It had a rich BBQ sauce which brought the whole meal together. Next the Asian inspired seared duck breast. The fat was removed and the skin, crisp as anything, layed directly onto the meat. I could have eaten ten of these. Desert was a lemon posset with passion fruit gel. Perfect after all that we had eaten before. And lastly some sweets. Im not sure what they were but they were just amazing.The dinner was not cheap and it was a once in a life time experience for me. But my gosh was it worth every single penny",

    "text": "What a great dining experience! The food and services are both top notch. My friend and I went for the 7 course tasting menu. We started with chestnut and juniper gnocchi with chestnut and truffle veloute. It was very tasty and I can just take a whole bowl of the veloute sauce as a soup course. Next we have a pan-friend fillet of cod. For main, we had two types of lamb, slow cooked neck of lamb and nice piece of loin. I have to say the portion was quite generous. Another thing that is worth mentioning is the bread. The whole time when we were enjoying the differences courses, we were given several choices of tasty warm bread. My friend and I liked the bread so much, we totally ODed on it. So by the time we finished the main, we were ready to call it quit. However, we still have some more exciting surprises coming our way. I love the cheese course. The two types of cheese were great, but the killer was how the crackers were presented to us. The restaurant cracker holders custom made from olive tree. So this course was like a cool piece of art work presented on our table. Then for dessert, we had white chocolate tart what was more like a slice of creme brulee. Then there was petits fours, basically 4 little bites of chocolates and sweets. We thought we were done and our lovely waiter brought on several cute donut balls and some best tasting caneles. Be prepared to spend a solid 3 hours there to enjoy your meal. And expect great food and exceptional services. Highly recommend it.",

The cooking on the night for me was less creative if I was to directly compare it to L' Autre Pied, but without a doubt it was more elegant and refine. The service was faultless, also I really like how they have refurnished the restaurant since I last visited two years ago, it has a much more classy feel to it now without losing its cosiness. I would definitely return in 2016 to see how Andy progresses and fine-tunes his cooking concept at Pied a Terre, and I am sure it will be something very special.",

At some point someone in my party asked the waitress, after they served a course, \"be honest, what we got is way better than what the vegan got, right?\" \u00a0She froze, looked around nervously, smiled sheepishly and backed away without answering.Obviously, they were more than happy to charge the full price but phone in the work. \u00a0So, let this serve as an example of their values. \u00a0If they had any respect for their work they would've just been honest and said they couldn't accommodate me. \u00a0And I would've been more than happy to give this spot to someone else in my company and everybody would've won.",

Each dish was consistently high quality, delicious and beautifully presented. I was impressed by their epic wine selection (basically two huge book volumes).While the staff were nothing but welcoming and accommodating I still felt a little bit intimidated being in such a high class place, just because every single detail in the restaurant was so precise. Certainly the most extravagant - and suitably expensive - dining experience I've had.I only took one star rating off because I personally rate based on for value for money - this restaurant is appropriately expensive and is more of a special occasion-type place.",

    "text": "Amazing dining adventure! I went there with 4 friends on a Saturday night and went for the 10 course tasting menu without wine pairings.While looking at the menu we were offered with a tuna tartare with potato and garlic croquette as \"amuse-buche\". Definitely a great start. The actual tasting experience started with quail poached egg served on a (really amazingl) asparagus cream. This first course made us understand we came to the right place.It followed a tuna tartare served with mini fried squid tentacles and basil velloute'. Again, an extraordinary preparation. (Only flaw in the evening, we had already been served tuna tartare before, I wouldn't expect such a repetition in a top notch restaurant like this).After the tuna we've been served white asparagus with garlic jelly, crab mayo and iberico ham. While the quality of each ingredient was astonishingly good, I found the iberico ham better tasted alone. The next course was poached and roasted sole with lemon grass mashed potatoes. The best course in the menu. Full stop.The fish was followed by veal fillet with garlic cream and mashed potatoes - definitely not disappointing. The cheese was \u00a0French Comte' and British Stilton - For the first time in my life a british cheese completely overcome France. It was followed by a \"Tasting of lemon and blood orange\" basically a layered dessert made with lemon sorbetto, orange jelly and lemon foam on top. Good stuff.Finally for dessert, we were served a chocolate cr\u00e8me with caramel sauce, salted peanut ice cream and chocolate jelly - which despite the \"complex\" description, was nothing particularly interesting, even though very well done.During the evening we were proposed with a broad selection of different breads, ranging from italian focaccia to a (superb) onion brioche. We order two bottle of wine (one for the starters, one for the mains and the cheese) and while we picked the first one ourself from the very well supplied wine list, we asked the sommelier for advice on the second one. He proposed the Madrian Baste 2010 with very good structure and the right level of tannins (the wine was left breathing in a decanter, as any wine with good body should).We finally asked for coffee, which was served with a selection of small pastry that I actually enjoyed more than the dessert.My overall sensation about the place: astonishing. Despite being quite expensive (we paid about 150\u00a3 each with service) it was worth it every pence. I strongly \u00a0recommend the pied-a'-terre to anyone looking for a fine dining experience in London.",

The restaurant isn't bad but it's certainly not up there with other Michelin star restaurants out there.To start the service was terrible. So slow. Our reservation was at 8 and we didn't get our food menu until 9 when I had to ask for it myself! When we finally ordered we decided to go a la carte. I ordered the quail to start which was delicious. I ordered the salmon for main course. It was cooked perfectly however my asparagus was way overlooked and I found a bone in my salmon. Not to mention the portion was tiny. Both courses were tasting menu size.. We all shared cheese plate for dessert.I don't mind paying for good food and service but I don't think this place is worth the price tag.Won't be returning",

    "text": "This Michelin one star, downgraded after a chef change from two stars, was eagerly anticipated on our one night in London, as we were returning home through London after Istanbul, Vienna, and Prague. A small restaurant, we were greeted by a somewhat confused hostess who had us walk around the two room restaurant to choose a table, unable to speak intelligibly in either English or French. We concluded later, when she brought a check to the table before we had even had our amuse bouche, that she may have been a bit handicapped and forgive her befuddlement.We sat for about 20 minutes before being greeted and given a menu, then another 10 before the requested carte des vins was brought. We wondered if we were invisible, though we could see each other and those around us. The back of my chair was repeatedly bumped by the servers who did not note the frequent encounters, so perhaps we were hard to see.The menu was not explained, the servers were too aloof and disinterested to convey any enthusiasm or information regarding the cuisine. The words they spoke were monotonous and the minimum needed to convey their message, robotic and disinterested rather than haughty or condescending. The first plates were introduced by a server who needs to learn how to enunciate; a brief course in elocution would have helped. It was not a language barrier, as I am conversant in English and French, but a service barrier.The white wine, a 2006 V. Dauvissat Forest Chablis, obviously just pulled from a refrigerator, was served at near ice cold temperature and took an hour of swirling and cupping in one's hands to warm to a temperature where it could be appreciated for the fine wine it was, and then it showed quite unevolved--as I suspect it had spent its entire post-bottling life in that cold refrigerator. By contrast, the 1999 L'Arlot Suchots was served at the perfect cellar temperature and showed quite nicely, but is not a blockbuster wine, more a wine of finesse and breeding.The food was quite good, presentation beautiful on lovely dinnerware/china, inventive combinations--I loved the langoustine/suckling pig combination, enjoyed the quail appetizer, and was quite taken with the partridge entr\u00e9e, my first time eating that bird, served with a perfectly cooked small piece of foie. All courses were delicious, though dropped off as unceremoniously as if we were being served a quick breakfast at Denny's or The House of Pancakes. Timing was erratic, with brief and then long pauses between courses. We were given dessert menus and then sat for at least 30 minutes before being asked for an order.Service of 12.5% was added to the bill; I suspect most diners would not have been that generous given the option.The saving grace--beside quite excellent food--was the charming sommelier who asked where we were from and actually engaged us regarding the wines and restaurant. He had a quick smile, a lot of kindness in his voice and actions, and was so out of place with his interest in this otherwise disinterested restaurant.We won't go back. There are too many fine restaurants that welcome their guests and make them feel comfortable. In fact, this experience motivates me to register on Yelp and perhaps OpenTable to render my opinion to others. The fine cuisine of this restaurant is tarnished by the unmotivated, disinterested staff that should be summarily dismissed--with the exception of the kind sommelier.",

    "text": "We had a top-class evening out at Pied a Terre. \u00a0We ate from the a la carte menu and we were happy with all of our courses. \u00a0We were delighted with the warm and personable service throughout the whole evening. \u00a0It is a Michelin starred restaurant, so you expect to see a lot of bonus courses in the way of a bread selection, amuse bouches and petits fours at the end. \u00a0They did each of these very well. \u00a0The bill was a bit pricey, but for this experience I feel it was worth it.My first impression was that the tables were rather close together, but as the evening progressed, this didn't feel like an issue after all.The table had a bowl of nocellara olives which we grazed on while we were browsing the menus. \u00a0These are our favourite type of olives and when we had finished the bowl, they refilled it! \u00a0We chose a bottle of Sancerre from the extensive wine menu.The bread selection was very nice; a good variety. \u00a0My favourite was the treacle brown bread which had a nice burnt caramel taste. \u00a0I was careful to stop after three pieces because I didn't want to fill myself before the later courses.The amuse bouches were pea and fois gras parfait and mini croquettes. \u00a0The parfait was beautifully presented in a sea urchin shell. \u00a0The mini croquettes had an excellent crunchy coating.Entrees:Morteaux Sausage Boudin with sauteed lamb sweetbreads, broad beans, girolles and a lamb and mint consomme. \u00a0This was very impressive. The consomme was intense. The sweetbreads were nuggets of joy and the small sausage was tender with a subtle flavour.Lobster with suckling pig glazed in honey, gremolata, romain lettuce and red mizuna. This was good, with an Asian twist. The salad dressing was refreshing and appetizing.Mains:Fillet of Pork with braised shoulder, sweetcorn, potato and parmesan gnocchi and shallot jus. The pork was tender and each corn kernel was juicy. \u00a0However, it did feel like a strange combination.Roasted breast of pigeon with hummus, smoked sardines, piquollo peppers and rosemary jus. The pigeon was cooked to my wife's liking, however it may have been better with crispy skin. \u00a0The meat was tender, but not as strong as duck. \u00a0It came with apricot which was a good pairing.After our mains, were were easily persuaded to have the cheese course. \u00a0This was one of the highlights of the evening. \u00a0The waiter talked us through all of the cheeses and their characteristics. \u00a0I wish I could remember all of their names! \u00a0We chose three of them: a hard cheese, an Italian cheese (a blend of cow, sheep and goat milk) and a camembert from Burgundy (very soft). \u00a0Our serving of cheese was presented with a \"cracker tree\": an interesting wooden ornament with slots for the crackers.We had a pre-dessert of fromage frais sorbet with black cherries. \u00a0A refreshing dish and an appropriate gear change from the cheese.Desserts:White chocolate tart with poached apricots, fresh almonds and lemon thyme ice cream. The white chocolate was not as strong as I expected. \u00a0This was good because white chocolate can sometimes seem too sweet. \u00a0We liked the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e style glazing on top and the ice cream pairing was good.Mango Millefeuille with coconut mousse, lychee jelly and passionfruit icecream. \u00a0This was simply awesome! It looked like a great deal of work had gone into constructing it: the delicate layering and the arrangement of the mini sliced mango in the middle layer.To complete the evening, I had a Sauternes Pinard sweet wine and my wife had a pot of lapsing souchong tea. \u00a0The tea had a very nice smoky aroma. \u00a0The tea came with enough petits fours for both of us. \u00a0Then, when we had finished those, we got a bonus round of petits fours! \u00a0All different from the first batch. \u00a0This was unexpected and, of course, appreciated.",

    "text": "This Place has 2 Michelin stars? Really?i could see 1, but 2?!let me explain....I went for lunch last week with a friend. I'm normally the one who is always 10 minutes late, but this time i was the first to arrive. i was greeted warmly and they offered me either in the front part of the back. I picked a seat in the main part of the restaurant. It was a beautiful restaurant. Small, cosy, refined, beautiful. As i waited, i looked around at the other clientele and how the staff were with them. There was a table opposite me with a small child, who (at that point) was very well behaved. Their waiter, however was speaking so loudly and forcibly that I could understand every word he said. It felt so brass and out of place, but I shrugged and let it go. \u00a0My friend arrived, and this snooty, i suppose she was a Manager? came over to take our order.... literally 2 minutes after my friend had sat down. \"We havent even looked,\" we say. For the next... 20 minutes... she ignores us. Finally we get her attention. We order off the lunch menu:\"I'll have the Chicken -\" me\"The Poussin,\" she cuts me off, correcting me.\"Yes,\" I say, \"The Poussin. Followed by the Lamb.\"Ok, i can understand if the menu is in French and you're checking to make sure i understand which dish I'm ordered, but the menu is in English, in an English speaking country. My friend had Char followed by Cod.My dishes were better. In fact, The Poussin and the Lamb were outstanding. which both of the fish choices were alright, but nothing to write home about. The dessert, a pumpkin panne cotta, was light and delicious. Our other server, in contrast to the loud one i had seen with the other table, was so quiet and mumbled his words so we frequently had to ask him to repeat himself. One amazing thing: The Bread. AMAZING. Treacle Bread with butter... yum....So, the moral of this story: it was good, but the service was lack luster and the food wasnt outstanding. Maybe i'm becoming a snob. Maybe they were just having an off day.",
