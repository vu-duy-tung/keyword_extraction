    "text": "It has been three years since I was in London, and I haven't stopped dreaming about Wagamama. As a broke student, Wagamama was a dining staple for us. This particular restaurant was our favorite, particularly because of its proximity to the cinema, theatres, and shops, but we were also seen having lunch one or two times a week at the Camden Town location, close to our school. I have had wonderful ramen at interesting restaurants since coming back to the States, but nothing has compared to Wagamama's. At first, we were on a mission to find the Wagamama equivalent in the United States, and ate at all the ramen places we could find. After accepting that better ramen does not exist outside of the UK, we dreamed and schemed about convincing Wagamama corporate to let us open a franchise in Los Angeles (hey, if Tesco could do it, why couldn't we?). I think we've come to the realization that we'll have to return to London to enjoy Wagamama again. However, if they ever do come to the United States, I hope that LA is their first stop.And I hope they still have the duck gyoza. Those were really good.",

There was no pho or soup place in site, so my friend's cousin (w/2 years of living in London) took us to this popular Japanese UK chain of ramen restaurants.

The broth was perfectly miso and it had a ton of meat (a rather large bowl). The veggies were perfectly mixed in too. A sweet combination of salty and sweet broth that probably saved my frozen bones from dry-ice cracking (that's how cold the chill was that night in November).

I normally do not try out such offers, but this one worked pretty well. This was the reason why my friends and I went there again. We had a nice little feast in the evening, before going to the cinema at Leicester Square.Normally, Wagamamas are situated in the basement of a store. We had to stand in a queue for a while before getting seated. The waiting time does normally not take too long, as Wagamama is known for fast food service. Not in a bad way, it is just not a place where you have a private table conversation, as you are seated on a long bench, which goes from one side of the room to the other.Already been asked by he waiters several times if we are ready, finally we chose form an extensive list of Asian food. They scribbled your order on the table set. Therefore you will be sure you will receive the right dish!We always start of with some edame - beans, which have to be popped out of their skin. They are fun to share. The dim sums I can highly recommend, they come with delicious sweet and chilli sauces. But for what they are really known are their noodle soups. I always opt for the hot option. I think Wagamama is a good after shopping or pre theatre place, as you do not want to over pay yourself nor waste too much time.There is one big advantage - this wagamama is one in three in London who does has a wheelchair lift!",

So, my husband flew in and we went to London for a couple days and thank God he knew of Wagamama!! I was a little skeptical about eating Japanese food in London, I knew the Indian food was pretty good but I never heard anyone saying anything like \"wow the Japanese food in London Rocks!!\" The only real compliments on food in London I've heard were on the fish and chips and the Indian food. That being said, \"Hello, go to Wagamama for great noodles!!!!\" \u00a0I had a cup of miso soup which was good and a really great bowl of ramen noodles with lots of mushrooms, and some sort of spicy pepper, (I think it was the Yasai Chili Men) and it was awesome!!

    "text": "This Wagas (as I like to call it) doesn't offer anything special by way of stunning views of London (like you get with their Southbank branch) or different menu/service options to all their other outlets but what it does offer is a fantastic location for a pre-theatre meal. This venue is right in the heart of Theatreland and for speedy, cheap and tasty nosh before dashing off to a show I don't think you can go wrong with Wagamama. I must give a big thumbs up their house red wine too, which is rather delicious and gulpable for a house wine. And the management get a special mention at this location too for always responding well if there's any issue with the food. (Also no problem here to order extra lashings of their secret curry sauce, always bonus!). Don't miss the entrance to this place (it's in the basement) as you walk down Irving St from Leicester Sq and even if they are queuing up the stairs (as they often are from 7ish), the queues go down quickly as will your food!",

They have high chairs and crayons for the baby (although he decided to try and eat those) and a vegan menu for my sister. My husband and I had the pork buns, the lettuce wraps, and a sirloin and shiitake salad along with two juices. Everything was incredibly fresh and delicious. It's a chain, but a very solid one at that. The only thing that was a bit spotty was our service that night. We were there at 8pm on a Friday night and were seated right away. Getting the attention of someone to get our order took a good 15 minutes though but our food did come out very quickly.",

    "text": "I've been to this Wagamama quite a lot as it has become our pre-cinema ritual if we're going to something at Leicester Square. Because I was running late, on this occasion we ended up going post-cinema instead.The restaurant was more empty than normal, because of the different time we arrived and there was some building work going on in the back. But there was also new menus - with new menu items. One caught my eye - a beef massaman curry. I love those - so I wasted no time in ordering it. The food as always was speedy, and arrived as it was ready, but I was disappointed in my curry. It just wasn't a massaman - it was edible, but not something I'd go out of my way to order ever again. In fact, I can't really describe it as I don't know what it was actually similar to. I ended up adding a bunch of things (soy sauce, those chilli flakes, the chilli oil) to make it more interesting to eat but nothing worked. The only time my tastebuds were at all interested in it were the bites when I had a sliced chilli in there.I wasn't happy with the beef either - it wasn't trimmed so there were chunks of fat at one each of each piece. I ended up biting the ends off and placing them in another bowl as I didn't want those! So yeah, don't order the massaman, but the staff here are lovely - they got the two stars on this visit. As the description for this level says, \"meh, I've experienced better\". So true for this visit.",

Pretty good for a chain.Location is pretty convenient to central, and it's nice that's right at Leicester Square. Nice, simple interior. You go down the steps to get to the main area. Service was not bad and pretty efficient. There's a good buzz and ambiance to these places, since the kitchen is partly open, so you feel like you're in the heat of the action.Food is your typical Asian fusion that tends towards Japanese. Got some yaki soba noodles that had just enough proteins and veg. The sister got something similar to that, both dishes not bad. A bit on the pricier side at about 8-9 pound each, but it's consistent.Being a US visitor to the UK, it was kind of funny to see another group of Americans sit down at the table next to us. I guess we like the same things hah.Will get this again if I'm in a hurry while visiting the UK!",

Asian, 2.) Ramen, 3.) Edible.I ordered their ramen and the broth was watery, the noodles doughy, and the toppings completely inappropriate and mismatched to the dish. I could make a better ramen by tossing random leftovers in my fridge on top of instant noodles.The menu is an affront to Japanese food, and an affront to anyone who has had the pleasure of enjoying a proper bowl of ramen. This is the Panda Express of noodles. Even the nonsense-word, made-up, Asian sounding name is insulting. It seems like the Asian food scene in London is exploding lately, I encourage you to try any other of the plethora of options popping up. If you really want to treat yourself, try Nagomi for a legit bowl of ramen.",

    "text": "3.5 - yep, I liked it.For chain food, it's pretty good and a nice change from gross pub meals. For what it is, prices are a little high but for a London tourist horrified by the exchange rate, it's one of the cheaper places to eat.I had chicken ramen and while I wasn't blown away, it was good. Everything came out fast and you could get in & out quickly, perfect for the busy tourist.",

    "text": "Slightly overpriced. \u00a0I ordered the yakitori chicken and miso soup, and my friend ordered the ginger chicken udon. \u00a0All were pretty yummy, especially considering that I have not eaten anything close to Asian food for 3 months for my stay in Europe. \u00a0However, I could have totally cooked this up myself in my apartment given the right ingredients, so not exactly the best value for my meal.I think my friend and I also had a good experience at this location due to the fact that they did not have a line, so our wait was short for both the seating and food. \u00a0Weird how they have everyone dine by sharing a long table with strangers. \u00a0So awkward how I could easily overhear my neighbor's conversation.",

    "text": "Surprisingly good for an asian fast food chain. Food tastes fresh and healthy. I had the gyoza, cha han, and the donburi. all were pretty good besides the chicken and prawn cha han. There wasnt alot of flavor in that. the miso soup was good and the kimchi wasnt so bad either. the picked stuff that comes with the miso soup is good. the donburi was great. good amount of terriyaki and chicken and rice.the service of this place is kinda whack but the location is cool and so is the interior decor. im honestly surprised that i like this place",

    "text": "Good food and the service is quick and reasonably priced.Just a few things to point out. You could be sitting next to people you don't know and they are close enough to hear your conversation. So if you want to discuss anything personal/private don't do it here. Also, the food is delivered when cooked. This is okay but my food came a good 10 minutes before my partners, so it was a little dis-jointed. Saying that, this is an advantage if you want to eat quickly to say catch a show or something like that.",
