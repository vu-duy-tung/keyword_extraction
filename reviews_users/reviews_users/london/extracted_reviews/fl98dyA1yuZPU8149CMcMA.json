It's great for weekends if you're relaxing and hanging around, but not if you're hangry and in a rush!",

During the Summer, for example, they had every single trading card sticker on display of the World Cup teams from the past. \u00a0Was really cool. \u00a0They also had a paper previously which was quite cool to see the various creations on display.I haven't been here for food yet but have come here for drinks. \u00a0They've got a full bar with many beers on tap. \u00a0In the Summer, they had a milkshake bar during the day and a hot chocolate bar at night. \u00a0Definitely would go again.",

    "text": "Been here twice now. Long story short, love the space but hate the food, and service still needs some brushing up too.My first visit was with fellow yelper Mario R. This was around lunchtime on a Tuesday, and some sort of event for mothers with babies happened to be going on. So basically it was me, Mario, and about 15 yummy/non-yummy mummies and their babies :-) \u00a0Mario went for the breakfast option with pancakes, which was decent. I ordered a flat white and the chorizo & chicken sandwich, which was terribly bland, and served with an equally unspectacular salad. But the biggest problem was at the end of the meal; our waiter was perfectly fine throughout, but charged for an extra salad. This didn't end up being a big deal, as he amended the bill, but this basically demonstrated that either he wasn't completely familiar with the menu (he told us that sandwiches come with a salad or coleslaw), or that there was a typo on the menu itself (I double checked and it said all sandwiches served with a side and coleslaw). So even though we didn't have to pay anything extra, we did have to wait quite a while for a manager to amend the bill, and we were left feeling as though we had done something wrong when we hadn't. Second visit was even more of a flop. I certainly had no plans of eating at the Proud Archivist again, but was happy to come for drinks, as it does have some lovely outdoor seating by the canal. I warned my friends not to order food here, but--surprise surprise--they did anyway. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?!! Anyway, one friend had soup which looked mediocre, and the other went for a sandwich, which seemed to be a veggie version of the one I tried on my previous visit. Wait, I take that back. Veg... and GLASS!! Yes, that's right, my poor friend bit into her sandwich only to find a piece of glass in it! We were all perplexed as to how glass could possibly wind up in food. Obviously we alerted the waitress, who proceeded to take a good look for herself (no, we weren't lying about the glass...) and after apologising, simply brought out a cookie and removed the sandwich from our bill. If I had found glass in my sandwich, I certainly would have made a bigger deal out of of it (could've potentially even taken legal action against the establishment...), but I guess my friend is nicer than me and just wanted to leave it. But I feel I must inform you all of this incident, and advise you to definitely check for glass and who knows what else if you ever choose to dine here!So you might ask, why am I awarding a somewhat generous three stars after the glass incident? I do so because I feel the Proud Archivist does have great potential to improve, and love having such an aesthetically beautiful and airy space so close to home. But Proud Archivist, for the love of god, please make sure glass is never in anyone's food ever again!",

The amount of times I have seen something on Twitter or Instagram and then go in to the Proud Archivist only to find the staff have no idea what I'm talking about, or they're not serving that dish, or Yolk (amazing breakfast pop up in the kitchen) aren't actually here today, is a joke. Most of the staff in general, seem to lack any knowledge or basic training.There are so many great bars and restaurants in Haggerston, go somewhere else. At least until this place pulls it's act together.",

We have visited for bottomless brunch also - which is a fantastic idea but the bubbles were far from free flowing in fact they ran out! The food was good, well cooked with fresh ingredients but to me lacked the WOW factor. I want to rave about this place and I know I will be back but there is just a bit of fine tuning that needs to be done. Oh I also must mention - the music on Saturday nights is top notch!

The porridge and bap were both cold on arrival and my coffee never arrived, but showed up on the bill. Please don't forget my coffee (after being reminded twice) then put it on the bill where I then have to awkwardly ask you to remove it. Seriously -- amateur hour over here, on repeat. I just can't.

    "text": "Having read so many reviews from trusted yelpers, I was keen to visit the TPA myself as their star rating varied greatly.I was here for a yelp event, but arrived early so that I could check the TPA out for myself. It is set off the Kingsland Road directly on the edge of the canal. It's a very modern spacious loft looking type of bar, that also acts a \u00a0bistro/restaurant/gallery. They seem to have lots of things going on most nights of the week. There were plenty of areas and rooms that can be used for private venues, including a large gallery upstairs. Our party of 30 manage to sit and dine comfortably in the gallery space with plenty of room to spare.It appeared that they are focused on cocktails, with a limited selection of draft beers. I went for a pint of Brahma, a Brazilian beer that I first encounted in Rio. It was nice and cold. It was a ltlle shy of \u00a35, so not on the cheap side. The outdoor bar area appeared to be closed, so I sat outside by the canal. Very nice. The staff were plentyful and helpful. I'm not sure about the unisex toilet though.The food was very good. I had three courses and enjoyed all of them. They make a really good burger, which was big enough for me not to complete.The TPA has a nice atmosphere. I should imagine it is rammed at the weekends though.",

There's a lot of things on offer here and it's commendable. For me personally though, it tries too hard to do it all and is somewhat pricey for the area, and if you come here for a drink there's nothing in particular to pick this place above others. Go for sure if it's a nice day by the canal or you need a good workspace etc. But for drinks and food? Try somewhere else!",

I went to a Yelp event here but came early with a friend for a drink on the side terrace. Nice selection of drinks alcoholic and non. I had fresh squeezed lemonade which may have been a seasonal special as it came out of a big jug with a tap (reminded me of the states). Service was friendly although not super speedy. On the terrace were benched tables which seemed a bit big for the space and quite awkward to get in and out of - apart from that the breeze in this area and spot was perfect for an after work catch up. Upstairs there was a library theme with shelves organised by colour - it was nice. I had steak and chips which hit the spot perfectly (good portions) and the steak was nice quality. The chocolate cake came with a fruity cream/sorbet and it was delicious.",

The truth is, The Proud Archivist is anything you want it to be. You can hire it out for an event, you can go along for a nice cup of tea or a seriously good cocktail, you can even go and check out the latest upcoming film/art/comedy - it really is the venue of all tricks and trades.Having personally met the owner, Hector, a few times now - I can honestly say he's one of the most enthusiastic venue owners I have ever met (and I've met a lot). His passion and vision for TPA being a venue of culture and inspiration is undeniable and you honestly believe that when you're there.In addition, it's located in Haggerston (yes, it's East! Don't moan!) by the canal which is just wonderful in summer! A real must.A few pointers:1. Sadly it shuts at 10:30pm so don't think you'll be having a late one.2. The bar staff can be a tad slow at times but they're working on it.3. Definitely check out their multi-coloured light room if you can - who wouldn't want a room that changes colours?!4. Want a unique location for an open event. The Library is the spot for you.",

No luck.We returned on the Saturday and, with a little more perseverance, we finally found it. Jolly glad we did as well. Loved the place so much, we came back again the very next day.It's a beautiful space, very modern, with various areas - for eating, drinking, foosball, perusing their art exhibitions, catching some comedy or even a film screening. We went along for the Out of This World Weekender in December, where we caught a bunch of super cool sci-fi movies. It was a great introduction to the venue.I'm looking forward to going back in the summer - The Proud Archivist sits along the canal and has beautiful views that I'm sure will only be improved by a spot of sunshine. Come and join us!And so you don't have to spend an age wandering the streets like we did, making sure you check out these directions... theproudarchivist.co.uk/\u2026",

    "text": "This place could have such potential. It's a gorgeously large space, overlooking the canal. What's there not to love? But my advice on a sunny day in Haggerston is not to go inside, but instead head to the nearest off licence, grab a bottle and sit on the banks by the canal outside the Proud Archivist. The whole experience would be less frustrating for you.Sorry to give a moany review but there's so much to moan about here. And I wanted to like it, I really did.Service took an age. Inexplicable as there weren't that many people waiting at the bar. I was told \u00a0when I finally was met with a server that maybe I should sit down and try table service instead as it would be quicker, which made no sense being at the front of the bar at that point. On a second occasion after waiting for another crazily long time, the waitress took my order, then spent a painful ten minutes looking for a specific bottle of wine in the fridge. Only to realise after that it was not my order she was preparing, instead she's completely forgotten it and is now putting the dishes away.On top of that we were told there were no cocktails available. Only one person knows how to make them and he's sick. Also no one knew how to use the Cake bill splitting app, that they have available for online payment. And lastly the food menu is just too expensive for what is essentially a bar and not a posh restaurant. \u00a314 for a burger and \u00a38 for a starter isn't appropriate. \u00a0They need more bar snacks and light bites on their menus. Alas there weren't even any nachos that Baya C recommended so heartily in her review. I have to add in the interest of fairness, that it was one of the server's first days in the job. But to be honest as Colleen C puts it, it feels like it's a perpetual first day for The Proud Archivist.It gets two stars because of its looks. I'd love for it to redeem itself, and get better as it could be a lovely canal side spot. \u00a0So prove me wrong TPA and improve.",

The food was good, the linguine was a little on the bland side, but the cheese on it was really tasty and I loved the Eton Mess, it was the perfect summer dessert. Although my first time here, this is only 25 mins from my work so will definitely be heading back again to sample more of their drinks menu.",

Which could be ok if the good was really good but it's just OK. Two eggs Benedict served in a big plate with no salad or other garnish even if just for a bit of decoration does not give a good first impression. Eggs were also too undercooked and they overdone it on the pepper sprinkles. We had the eggs Benedict and the avocado in sourdough bread with duck eggs and I must say the duck eggs had a better serving. The tea was good and served in a nice container with actual tea leafs rather than bags but I was highly disappointed with my coffee! Not only coffee was not of great quality and a bit burned, but the soya milk used is the cheap type that curdles with hot drinks which is very disappointing to get at a coffee shop. It does also have an interesting exhibition space and I must say I do like the space right by the canal but definitely not I sending to have brunch or coffee here again. Fine for drinks as they do have a pretty good bar and staff is friendly.",
