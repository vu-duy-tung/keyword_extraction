At beast it was BORING AND TASTELESS - at worst it was completely overpriced for that little piece of tasteless meh! I hate the \"the food will come out as its ready\", no! We are here to eat together. Go and hire some real chefs who know how to cook such that things are ready at the same time. Pathetic, cheap ass food with high prices and poor service. I am NEVER going back. I've had better food at chipotle, and they ain't high class. This place just needs to go away!!!",

Slow cooked, picked onions and black bean sauce. \u00a0The steak tacos were very good as well. \u00a0Guacamole could use some salt but home made looking chips were great as well. \u00a0A friend ordered the pork pibil dinner item and that looked damn good, slow cooked with rice. \u00a0I get that we are no where near Mexico and my diet has changed but this place is pretty good and will be on regular rotation now.",

And lord knows how I likes me some decent mexican food.In terms of ingredients, prices, and to some extent, ambiance - I'd probably fancy Wahaca as the Wagama of mexican food.I love Wagama. But I only write reviews for pseudo-mexican food joints. So.....So here's what's good about Whaca:- THE HABANERO sauce is THE MUTHA F-ING BIGGIDY-BIZ-OMB!!! **erm** sorry..... \u00a0But seriously, I love it so much that I inevitably scold the inside of my mouth every time I attempt to drink it. I can't help myself... It's. so. damn. good.- The CHAIRS downs stairs are pretty FUN. With 2 swinging chairs and 1 roly-poly chair. Butt no one really knows how to capitalize on the fun-potential the roly-poly chair might actually have to offer... - good guac (though pricey)- good ingredients (i'm of the opinion you can't mess up mexican food much with good ingredients)- Very very efficient bathroom (toilet) layout - 3.5 lady toilet options to ~2.5 mens toilet options & 1 overlap of facility w/ universal wash area... BRILLIANT.- vibrant environment \u00a0/ cool takeaway items - a matchbook filled w/ Serrano Chili seeds so that you can grow your own chili plantation!Here's what sucks about Whaca:- Not enough FUN CHAIRS downstairs... - Usually a long wait (especially Friday evenings) but you can't fault them for that, right? I just did.- The chips. The chips cost \u00a3... see Chipotle review.- Not a single mexican person in site. a few Spaniards though (not the same..)- Foosball tables are NOT LEVELI'd probably give Wahaca 4.5 stars if that was even possible on yelp. But it's not. And that's okay, because only 1 out 3 of the serrano chili seeds actually worked so far... And, I'm not even sure it's actually a serrano chili plant after all... So 4 stars. 4 stars sharp.",

We started off with the guacamole and chips which was so good I had to order more! We matched this with some of their delicious tequila and a margarita. There was a little too much salt on the margarita glass for my liking, but that's just me. The service was incredibly attentive, the staff was enthusiastic about the food, they keep checking up on us and kept an eye on our drinks which was most welcome. For the tapas I would highly recommend the Pork tortilla and the Chorizo Frijoles. They are a taste sensation. We followed their recommendation of ordering 3 tapas each but really struglled to finish them. They are surprisingly filling. The atmosphere was getting really buzzy by the time we left and I am sure it will continue to do so at lunch and dinner times being based in Soho. If I still worked in Soho I would be here every lunchtime for the Frijoles, Guacamole and Chips.",

A booked table at Wahaca \u00a0yes you did hear me right.that is a serious prize on its own. This place is busy for good reasonyou can't book (just rubbing it in!) so arrive an hour earlier than you want to eat \u00a0grab a buzzer to let you know when your table will be ready and head downstairs to the tequila bar to grab some cocktails.the time will soon pass by.Great buzzy atmosphere, clean and cool interior and really great staff. Friendly and welcoming which is not easy to consistently deliver to queuing diners who want to be eating now. (See photo below) Great guacamole and tortilla chips \u00a0you can also choose pork scratchings. We ordered El Tesoro tequila and sangritta (a kind of non-alcoholic Bloody Mary with orange, grenadine, spice & tomato \u00a0seriously good) to accompany it.We then moved on to a series of tapas stlye taster dishes some of which we ordered ourselves and others came as our samplewe had:Squid and ChipotleMSC ceviche tostadaSummery new potato taquitoChicken tinga tacosBroadbean and feta quesadillaPork pibil tacosGrilled cornvarious beers and tequilas (See photo below) MSC ceviche tostada Shrimp and scallops with habanero chilli, lime, cucumber and mint on tortilla (See photo below) Chicken tinga tacos Chicken in a smoky tomato sauce topped with crema and extra-hot chipotle adobo (See photo below) Pork pibil tacos Slow cooked pork in a Yucatecan marinade (cumin, oregano and spices)  (See photo below) Classic Chelada Corona Extra For 50p extra you can have your beers served with salted glass rim, ice and freshly squeezed lime. Food arrives very quickly, in no particular order. Enjoyed it all \u00a0the pick was the pork pibil tacos.They do offer traditional main courses but this is a place to have fun, to experiment. to share and the street food menu is perfect for this. They offer a fixed selection of plates for 2 people to share for \u00a319.95 which would be good place to start if you don't know the menu. Perfect for birthday outings and group bookings with friends where you cam order lots of dishes from across the menu. Its a fairly young crowd on a Saturday night (unless that's just showing my age) and it will be busy. Will be back where no doubt it will earn the extra star once we experience it without a booking and free sample menu.",

And, for a Friday night, our food came surprisingly quick...when we finally got our server. It took him 10 min just to greet us and another 15 to come back to us for an order. Not once did he check on us to see how we were and when we were done we literally had to wave him down to get our bill. Unacceptable no matter what the night; but the kicker, it wasn't even busy. As far as I could tell he had no more than five tables. Plus, now (at least this) Wahaca is saying food may arrive at different times. They're pulling the old Wagamama chestnut of not knowing how to time cooking food. This is nothing more than laziness on the part of the kitchen. It's why I stopped going to Wagamama and why I'll stop going here if this is the new trend. For atmosphere and location it's a 4.5. For service it's a 0 - and the latter is always more important than the former!",

    "text": "I will start my review by saying that I am of Mexican heritage. \u00a0Having grown up eating this food, I am throwing in my 2 cents.Having moved to England a few months ago, I had been really eager to try Mexican food here from a chef who knows what the food and culture is all about. \u00a0I'd seen Thomasina Miers show on TV, cooking with Mexican men and women in their homes and restaurants in Mexico. \u00a0She knows the ingredients well and can pronounce them like a native Mexican. \u00a0Her enthusiasm for the culture and cuisine is evident .So, the restaurant. \u00a0It's not \"authentic\" per se, but more like an introduction to Mexican food for those uninitiated. \u00a0There are nods to authentic flavors, but they have been modified a bit for England(which is understandable).The pork tacos I ordered were flavorful and the meat was tender. \u00a0However, they were sopping wet, with at least a tablespoon of liquid dripping off each one. \u00a0Considering how small tacos are, this was an issue. \u00a0If I were having a stew this would have been great, but I was having a taco.The chicken tostadas were tasty. \u00a0The garnishes were modern, fresh and crunchy. \u00a0However, on such a small and thin vessel, the toppings were far too high. \u00a0Am I eating a skyscraper or a tostada? \u00a0The only thing that saved the tostada from breaking into a million pieces, were my years of experience eating these. \u00a0Any wrong move and the whole thing would have collapsed or toppled over.The horchata was a disappointment. \u00a0It's one of my favorite drinks. \u00a0It lacked cinnamon and was watered down. \u00a0Think milk + water. \u00a0Literally.The churros were not good. \u00a0I've had all kinds of churros, from Mexican street vendors, restaurants, fast-food chains, and have even made them at home. \u00a0I had high hopes. They were chewy and tough(wth) and were piped way too thickly. \u00a0They were not light and crispy. \u00a0I've had better churros in England from a Spanish market vendor in Leamington Spa.The Mexican hot chocolate was made with almond milk(pretty sure). \u00a0No. \u00a0I know this is a modern take, but at least try to make up for the switch-up with spices. \u00a0It had none and honestly tasted like someone had added a packet of chocolate powder to milk. \u00a0A little confusing to say the least. \u00a0I will summarize by saying that the entrees were tasty, but the desserts and drinks were oddly bad. \u00a0Seemingly simple things, were uncharacteristically bad. \u00a0My overall opinion of Wahaca is that it is representing Mexican food pretty accurately considering the location, England. \u00a0If you are new to Mexican food, this is a great introduction.Lastly, I really hope they jazz up the decor. \u00a0Mexico is about color and joy. \u00a0The restaurant closely resembles an IKEA dining hall, but with a few more colors. \u00a0There are ways to stay modern, while integrating the culture you are representing.",

    "text": "WA-HA-CAIs a good 'Mexican' staple for a quick dining out option. \u00a0I've spent a lot of time in the States and been to Mexico and hear the cries constantly of Mexican restaurants that it's not authentic or traditional etc. etc. \u00a0This isn't really what Wahaca is about. \u00a0They have some ingredients and ideas taken from Mexican cooking and have put their own twist and style to them.It's nothing groundbreaking but i've been several times and everyone i know likes coming here as it has a fun and relaxed atmosphere and everyone likes small plates so there's plenty to share. \u00a0Well not everyone likes this as people get very VERY precious about their food but sharing is caring folks.They have a good selection of tacos, empanadas, taquitos, quesadillas and more. \u00a0All are tasty, but not groundbreaking. \u00a0They also have larger plates and plenty of salad options. \u00a0These aren't fantastic real Mexican flavour dishes, they are good but this is a meal where 2 people can easy be full and have a couple of drinks for \u00a330 or less so don't expect a quincea\u00f1era in your mouth. \u00a0However, if you want an option that doesn't break the bank, is tasty, fun and where you'll get to try a few new things then absolutely give Wahaca a go. \u00a0You can't book a table in advance though so every one i have been to come stocked with a bar area where you can try some standard Mexican beers and cocktails.I've been to this location a couple of times now and in terms of service the second was absolutely great, an attentive waiter who didn't come over anymore than he needed to, and when we did need him, he was over right away. \u00a0The first time however we had a near constant bombardment of asking are we SURE we don't want to order anything else as she was placing dishes on our table. \u00a0The pushiness and annoyance of being asked how everything is every few minutes each time with a full mouth got old quickly. \u00a0Other than that though don your metaphorical sombrero and get your taco on.",

    "text": "My dining companions were less than impressed with Wahaca, but I thought it was tasty. The restaurant came recommended to me by a friend as well as our local makeup artist, who we took out to dinner after a long day of hard work shooting Marcus Wareing at his restaurant and some business people at our cushy hotel. This outpost is about a ten minute walk from Mayfair.There was maybe a 15 minute wait for a table, so we headed downstairs to the bar. The space has a loungey feel with funky hanging wicker chairs and brightly colored furniture. It reminded me of SEA in New York. I didn't want to get my tequila on with such an empty stomach, but I was advised that the bartenders made a stiffer margarita than those working upstairs and serving the diners. I don't believe any kinds of chips come gratis, so we ordered chips and salsa and chips and beans. For the main event, you can mix and match a variety of tapas options, or get a larger main entree. I had a steak taco salad with pumpkin seeds, which I greatly enjoyed. I was fine with my margarita as well.They have churros on the menu for dessert(!!), but I was sadly too full to partake. I did grab a bunch of \"matchbooks,\" which are actually chili seeds. Fun! (Was I supposed to declare those in customs? Woops)If you're in London and seeking decent mexican food with an urban hipster crowd(this is Soho, after all), Wahaca's not a bad bet.",

Definitely could serve as more than a stopgap too, as the sizes of plates vary and this could be a nice place for dinner or lunch as well. Cool architecture fit within eight shipping containers fits well with the Southbank ethos. The place feels like a combination pop-up and Shoreditch box park. Nice work on the chorizo quesadilla (\u00a34.10), salsa and chips (\u00a32.95), pork tacos - a.k.a. cochinita pibil (\u00a33.95), and the side of jalape\u00f1os I requested :) Salsa was delicious but not spicy, and pork tacos were mouthwatering - definitely recommended. I should mention that I'm from California, so I'm a bit judgmental on Mexican, but nothing about this place raised my hackles. There's also an even more temporary taco truck parked outside with a few benches if you want to-go.",

Wahaca has nothing to do with true Oaxaca-style mexican cooking, which would be different kinds of mole, loads of black beans, chapulines on cream and excellent mezcal. I've been to Oaxaca recently and I loved the food, so to me this was a bit of a dissapointment, as I expected something different. The food was ok, especially the meaty tacos and tostadas where nice, we had a seasonal special which was spicy beef - this was clearly my favourite. Taquitos and quesadillas were not memorable, neither was the guacamole. But hey - Mexico is far away, I get it.If anybody reading this knows a truly traditional mexican place, feel free to tell me! I'd be very glad!",

We had to wait about 20 minute for a table so we went to the lower flor at the tequila bar to have a margarita that was good. The room is nice with some table and little poof chairs. Talking about the dinner, the service was good even if the waiter did not understand we ordered 2 coronas because of the noise in the room. The place is really big and and with plenty of people is not easy to chat. We had 1 tacos, 1 tostadas and 1 burrito. The first 2 dishes are considered as steer food and served in mini sizes like appetizers 3 pieces for dish. The tacos was nice but almost cold. Very good the tostadas with black beans. The burrito was the main dish and finally of a normal size. The total mount for the dinner was about 23 \u00a3. Not expansive but not cheap also considering the quantity of the food. Maybe I will test some other Mexican restaurant next time, before consider it to come back here.",

The second day I got the duck taquitos (they were a special that day), \u00a0pork pibil again and frijoles. This was the first time I had frijoles and they were delicious! They were topped with crema and crumbly cheese. The staff were friendly. I like how the food comes at different times and it is fun to share with your friends. The restaurant has a little magazine that keeps you updated- \u00a0they change the menu a good bit. Fish is sustainable and they try and recycle all the food waste. They seem to support small producers or use local equivalents of Mexican ingredients. I'm a fan. I believe there is an app so you can pay easily and quickly split the bill with your friends. It's a good place for groups.Tip:You get free churros if it is your birthday.",

Brightly colored ocean shipping containers joined together, wooden booths, simple lights add to the urban cantina vibe. The place reminded us of Jose Garce's Distrito restaurant here in Philadelphia. We were there on a warm summer day and sat in the semi-open air seating section. The menu was written on wooden tablets.We had a mixture of tacos and burritos. Everything was very fresh and the food came out quickly.Wahaca is modern Mexican food and the all the flavors were well developed. We had dessert also and that was pretty darn good also, The prices were \u00a0reasonable for London also. We don't really drink but there were quite a few people at Wahaca for the bar and margaritas and such.Definitely worth a visit if your down at the London Eye. BTB, the London Eye was FANTASTIC.",

Chorizo & potato quesadillas and the sweet potato & feta taquitos are among my favorite dishes. Alas there are many more and margaritas, never forget the margarita to wash it all down.Wahaca is simple, clean, affordable and tasty which makes me come back again and again. One last thing to note is FlyPay... LOVE IT. Seriously I'm not sure why every restaurant isn't onto this feature. Scan your table's QR code using a smartphone and bam there's your bill and you can pay right from your mobile device. I'm telling you, it's awesome y'all and it's this American Southerner in London's top hit for south of the border flavors abroad.",

    "text": "When I first moved to England I probably would have compared Wahaca's offerings to how they do it in Southern California and Arizona, where fresh, street style Mexican featuring organic/local ingredients served up in a trendy setting and alongside fine tequilas has been pretty much mastered. But where does that get us? We're not in SoCal, we're in London, where Wahaca is a fresh concept that is obviously resonating in the taste buds of the British masses. This place is packed and with a line out the door nearly every weekend night. The service is good, the food is really good, and the d\u00e9cor and ambience captures that casual Gulf of Mexico vibe with an edgy L.A. Dia de Los Muertos kick. I really enjoyed the refried beans and chips app, made with black beans and smothered in delicious cheese. The guacamole wasn't the best I've had, but fresh and with just the right amount of lime. The chips could definitely be better - but many Mexican places overlook this staple, and it's a shame. Just because you load it with fixins doesn't mean it shouldn't have a crisp freshness and flavor of its own. I recently had the three street tacos small plate order which, along with the beans and guac apps, was plenty for me (the server really tried to talk me into getting another small plate but I'm glad I didn't). I've also had the cochinita pibil burrito which left me a little unimpressed but not regretful. Overall it's a great menu with everything from quesadillas to tostadas to tacos to flautas and burritos.My one major gripe is with the serving style. I hate that the plates arrive at the table \"as they are ready\". Sure, this is common in beach-front food shacks which are a one-man show, but this is a well-oiled popular restaurant with diners who were taught that it's rude to start eating until everyone has their food. I can't stand eating cold food and can't stand poor manners. It's a no-win situation for me.BTW, \"Wahaca\" is the phonetic pronunciation of the city of Oaxaca, Mexico. When my husband kept talking it up, I was really impressed that the restaurateur took such a difficult name and slapped it on a new dining concept. When we finally went and I saw the sign, I smiled. Gotta ease 'em, in, I guess.",

Luckily we found this little gem. The food here is outstanding although it is slightly different from the traditional Mexican food I am used to. I had the pork burrito and the chorizo and potato quesadilla and both were excellent. I understand that this location is not permanent but hopefully not.",

    "text": "I went there at lunch time last month and I ordered 3 dishes from the Street Food Menu` which were Cactus Taco, MSC Ceviche and Chipotle Chicken. I am a virgin when it comes to Mexican food. I have never been inspired by the American chain in the past but now it has all changed and I thought I will give it a try. Nice decor and cool toilets. I didn't t realize that they would bring all the dishes at the same time as I thought the warm one might get cold but it didn't. I started off with the prawn one. It was quite delicious but I soon realized that what was delicious was the marinate not the prawns, completely tasteless and watery. You know when you put frozen prawn in water they will eventually defrost but you need to squeeze them a little bit otherwise you are left with what I experienced. It is all very well that the fish is environmentally sustainable but what about the flavour? The next one, the cactus taco was not too bad with good texture but I was not very impressed. Lots of chilli sauce that I had to wipe off with a napkin that I nicked from next table because my one was already full of sauce. The Chipotle Chicken was more to my taste with a lot of cheese which at times could be overpowering. Fortunately I started with the least flavoursome dish first increasing to more interesting flavours later. Had it been the other way round I would not considering returning. I also had a Citrus Fizz - very pleasant. Overall I think it was a good experience and I want to go back to try different dishes. One last thing, when they give you the bill, they also give you something that for a moment without my glasses resembled a book of matches and I thought that it was a bit weird, why would they give you matches? Do they want to encourage you to smoke? Soon after I realised that they were chilli seeds to be planted. That made me smile, I thought it was cute.",

Usually it's a great place to eat in I'm a big fan of it, but sadly it's just when they have time for you and there's more staff than clients... To me this experience kind of showed me that it's becoming a cheap chain of mexican food... the newsletter is the same one of over a year ago and the menu is still in winter time...

They also have a really interesting drinks menu \u00a0various types of tequila are perhaps to be expected but they also have some Mexican non-alcoholic drinks that are interesting and a bit different to what you would normally get at a Mexican restaurant.They lose points for me for other things though: atmosphere \u00a0the place is incredibly noisy and not all that comfortable); and the fact that they bring the food to you at random intervals, which they claim is about the authentic street food experience (um, wouldn't that involve an actual street?) but seems to me to be more about laziness about co-ordinating things in the kitchen, I love tapas/mezze style eating but not when it's forced on me and I don't get any choice about what dish comes when.",

    "text": "We came to Wahaca expecting a decent attempt at Mexican food in London, but they absolutely exceeded our expectations. Each location seems to produce the same quality of food, which is a huge nod to the chefs. We went to the Southbank location last night and the Soho location tonight. We ordered some of the same items at both locations and the dishes were so similar in flavor, I forgot we were at a different restaurant. The Vampiro juice is really refreshing, despite its dark color. The Classic Margarita is excellent and leaves you wanting anything round. The Twisted Mojito DF is good, but I prefer mojitos with rum instead of tequila as they use here. The standout items were the Pork Pibil Tacos; the Plantain Tacos; the Tender, Marinated Chicken Taquitos; the Broccoli with Green Goddess dressing; and the Sweet Potato side. The pork tacos are so amazing I swear you could drink the juice by itself. The chipotle sauce used on the taquitos is a perfect blend of smoky and sweet, with a hint of spice. The potatoes are perfectly cooked and seasoned, I just wish you got more with your order. Overall, I love this place. I just wish we had it in the U.S.",

    "text": "Had dinner here last night with 3 friends after our plans to try Bone Daddies went down the drain when we saw the queue outside. The place is really big, it's got a nice atmosphere and we were seated immediately despite it being really busy (especially for a Tuesday night). I love Mexican food and I tried more many Mexican restaurants than any other type so I was really excited to try out the food here. But alas, I wasn't really blown away. We ordered some quesadillas to share and as a main I ordered the 'British steak, the Mexican way', which came served with green rice. It wasn't disgusting, but I've had better steaks at the local pub. It was quite tough on the edges and chewy inside, I would have gladly added a bit of salt to give it some extra flavour but there was none on the table, and before I could call someone the steak was going cold so I ate it as it was. Bit disappointing. I've tried to save the meal by ordering some churros, which were actually super nice. Crunchy, warm, served with dark chocolate sauce, I loved them and could have probably eaten 10 more. Kudos for the very good prices (spent \u00a317 in total for 3 courses) and for how quick they serve the food. Would like to go back to give the food another chance and maybe try the mini soft tacos they do, but for now A-OK is how I feel about Wahaca.",

If you order and split the menu for two, you get a wonderful selection of the restaurant's best meals, and you leave with a bang for your buck. The atmosphere in all the joints is very cozy and friendly, so it is just an incredibly pleasant place to hang out at.Also, the famous pork pibil tacos are just phenomenal - a must try for any Mexican cuisine lover.",

I ordered the chicken quesadilla (4 quid) from the 'street food' section, which came with two slices of cheesy, spicy shredded chicken goodness. A few other friends ordered burritos (7 quid) from the 'bigger food' section, which were pretty large and came with some tortilla crisps on the side. We had the guac as an appetizer, and it was pretty standard fare.Tl;dr - standard Mexican fare in London.",

I am not trendy and I don't like trendy restaurants, where you sit in a big room with many other people and you have to scream at each other if you want to have a conversation: this is what Wahaca is like to me! Further, the turn-over is really high, which always makes you feel that there's something hectic going on around you. The food: it's really just A-OK...my quesadilla was quite alright, but the Winter Salad was just not tasty at all. The guacamole on the other hand was tasty, yet the chips were somewhat stale. Thankfully, all of the food was reasonably priced and so I didn't feel that I paid too much for a mediocre dining experience......yet, and this is where they really lost the third star that I was willing to give them: on the bill it says in bold letters \"SERVICE NOT INC\" and then in fine print underneath \"unless for parties of 5 or more, where a discretionary charge of 12.5% will be added to your bill\".This is just taking advantage of the customer, who will read the bold message and might just add tip again, even though it has already been added!",

    "text": "This canteen style Wahaca has an excellent location on the South Bank which means it is usually incredibly crowded. We arrived early and not in a major hurry so put our names down and headed upstairs to the bar (you can put your group down even if not everybody has arrived, but you won't be seated until everyone arrives, although if by that point you're the top of the queue you will be seated next, if that makes sense...). Service at the bar is slow which is a bit annoying but the drinks are good (I recommend the hibiscus mojito over the margarita, the margarita is a very short drink and by the time you have panted your way to the bar and back you will have finished it). It's ideal at this stage to get some guac and chips as the guac is good and it will stave of hunger irritability.I've found before at Wahaca that the food comes out somewhat randomly and they tend to make mistakes e.g. bringing double the order or missing part of it and bringing it later or not at all. So keep an eye on it if you're in a group - the server made no fuss at all when we mentioned something hadn't arrived.So as for the food - our gluten free friend was delighted to find she could eat most of what was on the menu (tacos, taquitos although not quesadillas or burritos). Tacos were overall pretty good (we tried chicken, pork, steak and cactus and all went down well, the steak probs my fave) although in fact I was more of a fan of the quesadillas especially with the house sauce (the brown one). I particularly loved the sweet potato side which combined 2 of my favourite food qualities: sugar and garlic.The seating area we had was cosy and seated 6 easily, it was great for a group. Downside of the bar area is that there isn't much seating for a larger group.Would definitely recommend as long as you are not starving or in a hurry.",

It's no Freebird, but I'd go so far to say that it's at least as good as Chilango, and the ladies behind the counter can at least wrap the things appropriate (unlike the ones that work at Chipotle).Unlike your typical street food vendor, this Wahaca actually has tables and seating, which makes immediately tearing through the foil and stuffing your face full of tortilla-wrapped goodness extra convenient. There's nothing like instant gratification to satisfy the soul when your tummy's rumbling.Whilst I wouldn't recommend going massively out of your way for a lunch here, if you happen to be in the area and looking for a quick meal, this stand will set you back \u00a36-8 for a substantial portion, and you won't be going hungry anytime before dinner!",

    "text": "Oh man... Mexican food. I'm sorry to say but Mexican food has yet to make a serious impression on me in Europe. I perceive myself a connoisseur of empanadas, tacos, tamales, and taquitos. I may be overstating my importance and knowledge of the cuisine but I do have a extreme love for it and it is one of the few foods, aside from mom's, that I have craved ever since moving here.I went to Wahaca for a Birthday Dinner for one of my coursemates on a Anthropology of Food course. I trust my peers to lead me to good restaurants though I was a bit dubious when she told me that it was going to be Mexican food. Several other American classmates and natives to South America were a bit skeptical but we arrived after several pints at the student bar. With a little extra encouragement our hesitations turned into excitement to try the foods. Wahaca does \"upscale street food\", as I call it. It's not street food. It's not the greasy, grubby, stuff you get from a sweaty man hovering over an steaming griddle; not entirely sanitary but saintly in taste. At Wahaca everything is plated on white plates; if it were a person it would be dressed in Sunday's best. Ultimately, through the haze of a few pints of ale and a traditional mojito, I came to the conclusion that the food was... good; not amazing, outstanding, or life changing but enough to satisfy my crave for tacos, taquitos and other various forms of Mexican street food. The price of the food is a different story. It's Soho, so I expected a pretty high price and I wasn't wrong. I spent 23 quid here and I split the bill with a friend of mine. In total it came out to about 50 between the two of us and that is very pricey for a graduate student. All things considering, this is a good restaurant. Had this restaurant been in America, I probably would have rated it 3-stars rather than 4. For me, having been spoiled with growing up so close to Mexico it's easy to find amazing Mexican food for a very cheap price, but Wahaca is hands down the best Mexican food that I have had in London SO FAR.",

After 10 minutes we were offered a table with another couple - only downside really as an Englishman I found this a tad awkward. Our waitress was lovely and attentive if a bit rushed off her feet and the open windows really allowed a lot of air to circulate through the restaurant on a mild summers evening. The food itself was very good, I can only imagine some of the margins they have on the products though. The broccoli dish was delicious of course but quite overpriced. My favourite dish of the evening was the Sweet Potato Taquitos (we decided to be a fat and ordered it again). Oh and the cocktails were glorious as well. I would recommend the Gin Sling (our waitresses favourite). We didn't go for dessert as we had already stuffed ourselves full so I can't comment on that but I plan to in the future....Overall very good food, lovely service and a cool, relaxed atmosphere for a Saturday Summer evening on Southbank. I will definitely be returning.",

Eight shipping containers have been joined together and painted vibrant colours. This restaurant and the food truck out front serving truly authentic Mexican Street Food have shook up this little corner of London. Like a transport depot which arrived to piss off the badly costumed SpongeBob and a very short Darth Vader outside hustling tourists for pictures. Inside they have some really clever seating both in and around of the containers. Authentic Central American beers and some stunning Tequila mixed drinks were a great start. The we kicked into some a plate of amazing Carne Tacos and stupidly gorgeous guacamole with home-made tortillas. . Then a really great sharing plate of various substances. Black beans, mashed green chillies, cilantro, a stack of tortillas and finally a large pot of Cola marinaded pulled pork. Absolutely stunning. Medium priced but definitely worth the visit. Amazing view of the river while munching on great Mexican food. This is truly is a great experiment but one that will not last for long - in eighteen months from this review - it will be gone, Get your ass down here soon and enjoy it before it goes.",

We were welcomed in and led to a perfect table right near the baby changing facility, which was much appreciated. Service was excellent and the food as well. We ordered the Wahaca street food combo for \u00a319.99 and added a couple things to it. Everything was outstanding except the chicken Parmesan tostada which we found quite bland, however it was perfect for our daughter so we couldn't really complain. We'll definitely be back!",

The only downside is it's a bit loud but it's a fun space to end your week. \u00a0I had a dinner of \"street food\" which equates to small plates so that you can have a variety of different experiences. I enjoyed them (2 - 3 as suggested is the right amount) but I have to comment expressly on \u00a0the taquitos - specifically the sweet potato & feta taquito was an unexpected treat. \u00a0I generally stray away from anything described as deep fried but they were truly wonderful!",

    "text": "Okay, I have to give the restaurant some leeway because, well, London has a sparse population of Mexican chefs compared to San Diego, CA, where I'm from. But here I go...The place (food and atmosphere) can hardly be called Mexican. It's got more European flair than anything. For food, it's definitely edible and can be pleasant if you're not distracted by what it's supposed to be, but it's more like that awkward cousin of Spanish food dressed in a sombrero and some misguided gaucho trousers. When you go get Mexican food, you expect it to be dirt cheap, but this place is more like a pricey gastropub than a mom and pop shop. The decor is slick rather than homey. The wait could compare to a good Mexican eatery, however, when you get to the end of the queue, there isn't a tasty carne asada street taco waiting for you. I wouldn't avoid this place, just know that when you eat here (especially for the travelers out there), don't come expecting legit Mexican food.",

I love regional Isaan food best, but anything best served anywhere in Thailand on a plastic stool five inches above the ground is good with me. Thomasina Miers, who owns the Wahaca chain, also has a street food obsession, her passion is for Mexican.I've been to a Yelp event here and loved the tasters we were given, now I've been back to eat for real I can definitely say that the street food section of the menu is a solid five stars. As are the Corona Micheladas. The British steak burrito was only okay though, a bit dense, lacking in freshness and not hugely flavourful.This time we started with a portion of the Guacamole and pork scratchings, as if anything involving pork skin will ever be less than perfect. And the tomato salsa and tortilla chips, from reading other reviews it seems we were lucky not to have stale chips, but they weren't and were delicious. We also got the Pork pibil tacos which are insanely good! Flavourful, porky and so juicy! The Herring tostadas, delicious, the fresh marinaded smoked herring is so gooood. The Chorizo & potato quesadilla, which I wouldn't have chosen reading it from the menu, but I'm glad someone did! It wasn't at all as potato-y and heavy as it sounds. And the Chicken wings a la mojo which were incredibly moreish and perfectly lifted with a squeeze of lime.Basically it's all good!",

    "text": "I have been to both the Covent Garden and Soho Branches of Wahaca and I prefer Soho for atmosphere and space. I have found it has generally been much quicker to get a table here and the food has been slightly better here. Wahaca can never be criticized for having a lack of flavour or presentation where its food is concerned but sometimes the quality has been notable. For example sometimes things have been a little too soggy or just slightly over or undercooked. But then I do remind myself that when there is a lot of orders on then sometimes things aren't as perfect as when you last had them. I hold no issues at all with this and I will say that there has never been a case where it has become shockingly bad, but when you are used to something being at a certain level then it spoils us in many ways. What I refuse to fault Wahaca on is price as well as diversity of choice in the menu. Only I have found that with many visits this winter I am keen to see what the new menu has in store. My advice to anyone is where possible to try and eat at Wardour Street if in central. In terms of things I adore on the menu, the Churros, Tortilla Soup and the taquitos always seem to find themselves on my receipt at the end of the meal. I am determined to try the fish taco's and tamales on my next visit, although recently I did experience a rather nice steak but I wasn't overly enthralled with the rice. It was pleasant but it didn't excite me in the ways I was expecting it to. Oh and do try the hibiscus drink too. It is like drinking rubies in a glass.",

It was just OK, I'm sure if this was your only source of Mexican food it would be a pretty good experience for you. It was pretty crowded so I assume it's popular with the local folk :P Maybe I should have gone with some of their small plates instead of what I was acquainted with from back home, but whaatever!

The restaurant itself is spacious, light and modern. The menu was really long and exciting. After some great Mexican food at Lupita's, my friend and I were eager to try out more authentic food. I ordered the vegetarian cactus and corn burrito-at \u00a36.50 it seemed like a good deal. My friend took the steak burrito. We got some guacamole on the side, which we didn't realise they would charge us for (but they charged us a hefty \u00a32.95 for a small bowl).The burrito was okay, but a bit on the small side, and the tortilla chips did little to excite me. The refried beans were a bit bland and seemed to be the main component of the burrito. The rice tasted a little bit too processed. I poured a lot of the hot sauce on my burrito to improve the taste but I think the burrito was also a bit on the sloppy side, lacking crunchy and tasty vegetables. I would give wahaca another try, they have horchata on the menu for only \u00a31.75, a relative steal. Otherwise, quite a forgettable experience.",

Guacamole was made fresh, and the tortilla chips were fried to just the right amount, leaning towards more of a thick cut. The wait is quite long, so a cocktail drink or two is kind of an expected move.For their dishes, I would definitely recommend Sweet potato & feta taquito. MM The feta cheese was soooo good, the mix of sweet and salty was just to the right amount. Portions were alright as well. Pork taco and winter vegetable tacos were mediocre, my friends would recommend the pork one, which was said to be marinated quite well. Be aware that the wrapping is corn tortilla, so the texture of the wrapper is softer and chewier. Huitlacoche was also quite good, two of these cheese and mushroom quasadillas, though nothing specially really. The MSC Fish burrito wasn't the best, not sure if the fish wasn't fresh enough or what not, but in my opinion not worth the \u00a37. all in all, 5 dishes between the 3 of us were just quite enough with a happy and fair tap to split among us. Oh, the dishes also came fairly quick. Lastly, their hotcake dessert is a must get. God! The combination of dulce de leche and sprinkled with caramelised peanuts is heavenlyyyyyy! Also, do try the plantain corn tortilla dessert thingy! Glazed with honey mmmM!Not sure if I'd come again, but do drop by if you're around southbank for a nice social night!",

    "text": "So first day in London went to this restaurant. My friend had recommended it and I had it on my bookmarks also. We had to wait for 30mins for out table. Waiting area is downstairs which there is fusball table and bar. Once we got table we had a look at menu and our waiter came to introduce himself. Bruno, fantastic guy. I had tacos with sweet potato fries with ginger beer. Food is delicious, fries were the highlight if my meal. Tacos were delicious but portion was quite small. Now the bad points.....ginger beer was terrible, did not like it at all. Price is also not worth it. Now food is amazing but portions are really small and I was still hungry. I had to go get a sandwich after cause didn't want spend more money here and still be hungry after. Services were great and reccomend this place but don't go if you are really hungry and expect to be full with a meal. Unless you willing to spend more.",

    "text": "Wahaca really exceeded my expectations and standards for Mexican fare in London. Being from Texas, I can be borderline picky and difficult-to-please when it comes to Mexican food. I was seriously craving some Mexican food in the middle of my London stay and I noticed that Wahaca came up frequently in my search. I was a little wary, seeing that it was a prolific chain but it definitely is a tasty and affordable choice for Mexican-style food and drinks in London.The interior of the restaurant is very colorful but has a nice and airy feel to it. I was expecting a more cramped, dive-y ambiance but there was lots of space. I can imagine that even when it is packed with customers, it doesn't feel too cramped. Wahaca's cuisine is definitely more Mexican-style than pure Mexican food. Many of the dishes are contain ingredients that wouldn't necessarily be found on menus in Mexico, but all of the staple dishes -tacos, burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas, etc.- appear on the menu in various forms. I like that half of the menu is small dishes, so you can order a couple and sample a variety of food. I was really hungry so I had two small plates and a side- the chipotle chicken quesadillas, plantain tacos, and roasted sweet potatoes. The standout was definitely the plantain tacos. I'm a plantain lover and the spicy salsa on the tacos was the perfect combination. The salsa had a spicy kick. The quesadillas were nice and cheesy, but otherwise not too exciting or different from what you'd expect. The roasted sweet potatoes were flavorful and perfectly roasted. I also ordered the vanilla-passionfruit mojito was fruity and strong. All of the cocktails sounded delicious and were reasonably-priced, even outside of happy hour. The service at Wahaca was incredibly polite and attentive. My server was so sweet. Most of the staff seemed eager to attend every customer. Overall, this was one of the better meals I had in London. Definitely the best Mexican food I have had in London in my many trips over the years.",

I really like the whole street style menu and the friendly and fast waiters, who gladly will explain the whole concept for first timers wearing a nice smile on their faces. If you're into hot, Mexican street food or just curious about the concept, I would definitely recommend that you check this place out. Their prices are reasonable and you don't have to order a whole lot, if you aren't that hungry. The places is always busy and be prepared for ore try loud surroundings, when the place is busy. I am coming back next year and will again happily eat at Wahaca, it's pretty much a tradition of mine now :)",

    "text": "Thank the heavens for Wahaca (Oaxaca), It saved me from shriveling up and turning into a spiteful monster wandering the streets of London. I should preface this review with the following info about me. I'm originally from southern California and Mexican food made up a good portion of our weekly meal choices. So that being said 1 month in London without GOOD mexican food was like getting breathing air again after a month without. Thats how much I value good mexican food, and not just me but my hubby too. But I digress. Back to the food. I was with fellow yelper Dza D at the Soho restaurant we ordered:3 orders of the Pork tacos1 order of the chicken tacos1 chicken quesadilla1 quacamole2 Jaimaica Or Hibiscus waterThe chicken quesadilla was tasty, with a sweet sorta bbq sauce with cheese and chicken. It was a great starter. I got the drier end and my companion got the wetter side so it was really drippy on him, but that could've been eating style too. Not sure what happened, but I thoroughly enjoyed my half. The Pork tacos were bomb. nice cut of meat with pickled onions on top with cilantro. The chicken tacos were the same thing as the quesadilla but without the melty cheesy goodness. I thought they were seriously lacking and just too much sauce. For dessert I had to try to the Churro con Chocolate, it was more savory and less sweet cinnamon that what i was expecting and wanting. Over all a really great meal.",

The salad has amazing flavours and if you want a lighter version you just don't have the taco shell but it's kinda irresistable!

This Mexican street food chain was started by the 2005 BBC Masterchef winner and has multiple locations around London.For some reason I was expecting it to be a little like Chipotle (upscale fast food), but it's actually more of a trendy sit down restaurant. There's great eclectic and colorful decor in the SoHo store and the restaurant was pretty dim for dinner. The menu is setup to try multiple items like Mexican tapas. The steak tacos were good and the chicken taquitos were tasty as well. I didn't get a chance to try the churos and chocolate but that dessert item sounded good.Of course nowhere can compare the street Mexican food in Southern California, but I thought this place was pretty good. There's a fun ambiance and you get to try a lot of different Mexican dishes in a more upscale atmosphere than a Mexican food truck. The overall cost isn't cheap but it also isn't that expensive. I'm not from London so I don't know the food scene here that well, but my impression is that there aren't a lot of Mexican restaurants here that serve this same type of food. I would recommend trying out this place if you want to eat Mexican and want to go somewhere fun.",

For a start they have a wide range of Tequila and Mezcal and their house brand El Tesoro is top of the range but not top price (I would go for the reposado not the blanco). I just found out that Sainsbury's only stock the very ordinary Jose Cuervo or the marginally better Sauza brands, so I'll popping over to Wahaca for a good tequila fix and they know their agaves there! The food was delicious too: really good guacamole, delicious garlicy mushrooms in cheese and I loved the meatballs! Wahaca means a great night out on a date, with friends or even if you are just visiting London. Viva la revolucion!",

One of the chants you may hear from customers gorging on the mexican delights inside; their mouths full of Chorizo and Churros, the Corona helping as a lubricant to produce this strange noise. I like Wahaca. It's fun and they don't try and stick a sombrero on your head whilst shaking their maraca's in your face to compensate for the pallid, mess of a burrito the chef is trying to dress whilst smoking a cigar. Ok so enough of the stereotypes. But isn't that the problem with a lot of Mexican restaurant's? Wahaca is different. It has blonde hair. A sleek, slender figure, and porcelain smooth skin. No hirsute appearance. No hint of flabby belly hanging out of the garish, floral shirt. It doesn't require that you stay until morning and exchange numbers as you make for the door sheepishly. It looks good, tastes even better and knows it. It is just happy you are there and selflessly wants you to fulfil one of your basic needs as quickly as you desire. The decor is quirky but minimal and the service prompt but not to the point you ever feel rushed. Darrn, the waiter had been to our table 3 times before I had even ordered and he didn't even so much as puff cigar smoke in my face in disgust. We opted, (once I had finally ordered), for the tapas style dishes; little tasters of authentic street-food cuisine costing around \u00a33.95-\u00a35.00 (gee's they must have some rich but well-fed vagrants in mexico!!)First was the slow cooked pork pilbil tacos, chorizo and potato quesadillas and then the street food special - Queso Fundido with (garlicky mushrooms in a cheesy taco). Aariba-aariba! What tasty offerings from the gods! \u00a0Imagine the Spice Girls were writing around in your mouth, naked, and then you get the picture! You can go for the whole Burito, Fajita experience if you want to be a little greedy but in all honesty there was more than enough here. In future I would try the sharing platter though (which I have heard is Kerry Katona satisfyingly huge), just for, erm 'research' purposes you know! I left satiated; slightly larger and merrier. My t-shirt saturated with a pork and potato congealed mess! Added 21/01: We did finish off with a warm and sticky portion of Churros (NOT the breakfast cereal!!) - well it would be rude not to!",

    "text": "Once seated, we got off to a bad start with a rather brusque waitress, who crossed that fine line between efficient and unpleasant with considerable aplomb. The waitress may well have 'explained' the menu and how to order, but she spoke so fast, and with such a strong accent that it was impossible to follow. Anyway, I'd been to Wahaca's before so knew what to order. Before long our food came, with the typical Wagamama's style trade mark of haphazard, staggered delivery. Chorizo and potato quesadilla: this was supremely cheesy, with not much chorizo flavor, but all round general yummiest. I'm a big fan of this. Black bean and cheese quesadilla: Rather too much black bean compared to cheese, and the flavor became a little monotonous quite quickly. Needs more flavoring or spice. Green rice: Ignore the fact this rice seems rather boil in the bag and a little cooler than expected \u00a0the flavoring of herbs in this rice is fantastic. It acts as a perfect foil to the cheesier parts of the menu. Sweet potato chunks: Delicious. Cooked till tender then deep fried with herbs and spices, these are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the sweet taste is not overpowering. One of my friends did get a dessert, which will be familiar to anyone who has been to La Tasca. Churros (doughnut twists deep fried) with a dark chocolate dipping sauce. Delicious, but greasy. If you don't mind the grease smeared all over your fingers, then you won't mind this dessert at all. All in all, the service was unimpressive, but I will be back, as I've always had great service before.",

The Tortilla chips are moreish but the pork rinds, I warn you, are not. They will break your teeth! Dreadful!

The ceviche starter I ordered was far from authentic being served on a tortilla chip (which made it a bit messy) but it tasted delicious and my British steak done the Mexican way (their title not mine) was a revelation, char grilled but lovely and pink served with green rice which was delicious. My only real complaint would have to be that the portions aren't huge so if you hungry you may want to think about an extra side. Oh and try the churros with chocolate sauce, I know it's difficult to mess up a deep fried dough dessert but these are delicious.",

I've been a massive fan of Mexican food ever since I first set foot into the Wahaca in Covent Garden a couple of years back; however, I think the Soho branch has the edge now that I've been as it seems a lot more spacious. Our event consisted of a screening of the second episode of Mexican Food Made Simple (hosted by wahaca founder Tommi) down in the basement bar of the restaurant. It's a very nice space with it's own bar, so definitely worth visiting while you are waiting for a table in the pstairs restaurant. First, the guacamole....YUM! I could happily have stuck with this all night. Well, I would have done if it wasn't for the delicious salsa (for which we were given the ingredients for in a goody bag), the broad been and feta quesadillas and the very moreish pork pibils (if anyone has the recipe please do message me!) that we were plied with for most of the evening. Plus there were the tequila-tastic cocktails. I wouldn't normally drink 4 cocktails on a Monday night but (in the name of research) I'm happy to report that I awoke without a hint of a hangover. Overall, I will DEFINITELY be heading back to Wahaca Soho soon. The food was great and the staff couldn't have been more welcoming. Thoroughly recommended!",

Where else can you sip quality tequila in a hanging wicker basket? Upstairs there is an amazingly huge restaurant area where they serve some of the most delicious Mexican street food around. The best part of the delicious dinner is, of course, the churros. These delicious deep fried doughnuts with cinnamon sugar come with a lovely thick chocolate sauce that you dip them in to.

With the opening of their Wardour St branch brings comfort to know there's back-up a short skip away. Previously a non-descript boozer, the place was stripped down and as much as possible of the old building was incorporated into the new design, which was commissioned to individual designers to give it a vibrant feel. For some reason I was particularly impressed with the design of the toilets; make of that what you will! Being more of a whiskey man I was scandalously ignorant the tequila process and, very much like the uisce beatha, the intricacies which can be involved, which resulting in a wide range of flavours. Contrast that to my previous encounters which normally involved a glass being pushed into my hand with dash of salt and a sliver of citrus well past the bewitching hour. The house tequila, El Tesoro, is highly recommended; compliments superbly the best of Mexican grub on offer. So if you haven't tried Wahaca yet, sort it out: are you a Mexican, or a Mexican't?!",

The downstairs bar is a very comfy and fun setting and incredibly roomy for such a central bit of Soho. Like tequila? Or don't think you've given it a fair shake in the past? The friendly folks at Wahaca not only take their menu of Mexican yummies seriously; they're also incredibly keen to spread the word that good tequila is good stuff: london.blog.qype.com/201\u2026  A great restaurant to keep in mind whether just popping in for a quick bite or planning a proper fiesta.",

    "text": "Foodwise this branch of Wahaca is still what they are everywhere else - tasty. The reason why this one interests me is the bar downstairs. I rather like tequila and while popularity is rising, the number of bars who do something with tequila seems to not be going up at the same rate, so another one appearing on the scene, below a restaurant or not, is to be praised. By me at least. I like tequila. And churros. I was along for a Qype-y tequila tasting and while a bunch of the things I tried will have a wide path steered around them in the future, there were some that really tickled my palate that will hopefully be appearing on their menu soon. The range of what we tasted suggests that you should be able to find at least one tequila that'll be up your street. Wahaca are looking to find new and interesting drinks that you probably won't have had before and for that I'm a dedicated fan. And the churros. For the time being they have El Tesoro heading a range of different flavours and styles of tequila, as well as a couple of Mezcals for those after something a bit different. The cocktail list adds a tequila twist to a bunch of classics and also includes a rather tasty margarita. They still don't take bookings so when you're inevitably waiting for a table pop down to the bar and drink some tasty mexican beverages.",

A great vibe - even for a Tuesday night! The pork tacos were as tasty as I remembered, and the dessert of creme caramel was pretty flan-tastico, while the churros con chocolate probably needed an extra sprinkle of cinnamon sugar to get my Gourmet Belly singing Ol\u00e9! The no reservations policy still stands, although with a fantastic space in the downstairs bar area complete with hanging chairs, fussball tables and an extensive cocktail list with Tequila making a strong presence, I don't think you'd have a problem passing time while you wait for a table.",

There are no fake cactuses and sombreros here - just serious interior design and equally serious attention to detail with their range of mexican 'street food', equalled by a passion for sipping tequila. A visit to Wahaca is a unique experience - definitely recommended (oh and they're not incredibly expensive either) Here's my review of the Qype tequila tasting evening we went to - it might give a bit more of a hint about what you might expect when you go there... londoneer.org/2011/03/te\u2026",

    "text": "-1 Star because of the wait to be seated and how LOUD the restaurant is. We called at 1715 for a table at 1800 and was advised that they do not take reservations. However, if you want to get your drink on in a spacious area, then waiting won't be an issue as they have a large downstairs area w/2 foosball tables, suspended seating and a large bar area; but most of the comfortable seating was \"reserved.\" The restroom is a co-ed space so don't be confused. You will enter the same door and wash-up in the same area but the toilet areas are still separate.When seated, the paper menu was thoroughly explained to us by the staff as it looked overwhelming. There are appetizers, small dishes for sharing and large individual meals. I love these options as I like to share food and try different things. We ordered one of each. An individual burrito dish, the steak and chicken small taco meals, rice and beans, empanadas, margaritas, chips/salsa and enchiladas. The best dishes were the burrito, chicken tacos, chips/salsa, and the empanadas.The steak was dry. The margaritas were very small. The enchiladas were weird. The beans and rice were just okay.The chicken tacos were amazing! Three small tiny tortillas topped with shredded chicken, a bit of spice, some pico, and lettuce. I could have had two orders of those, by myself!The restaurant itself is an open floor plan which meant that we were yelling at each other in order to converse, which wasn't ideal, since we were there to catch-up with old friends. I wish the space had some walls to reduce the noise.The staff was friendly though and the service was fast once we ordered. \u00a0I would definitely go back again, as finding authentic mexican is hard to find in Europe. And, we came based on a recommendation from my friend that is from Mexico. She said it was the closest mexican from home that she has had since moving to Europe, and she was right. There are three Wahaca locations and next time I intend on trying the others.",

    "text": "Having previously never been to Wahaca I ended up frequenting the Soho location twice on my recent trip to London; on a Saturday night and a Monday lunchtime. They offer reasonably priced, good quality, street style Mexican cuisine in a colourful and vibrant setting. I wasn't expecting to eat such phenomenal Mexican on my visit, and from a chain no less.When we arrived at 6:30pm on Saturday the place was already full but we were fortunate enough to be seated right away. When we left at 9pm there was a line out the door. The server was prompt in bringing us menus, drinks, food and the bill and I felt was generally very available without being too pushy.Given that there were three of us we decided to order a suggested selection menu for 2 that included a variety of street food as well as a few supplementary items. Everything was delicious but the highlights for me were the sweet potato and feta taquitos, the guacamole and the black bean and cheese tacos (which were on a specials menu not the regular menu). My friends were big fans of the pulled pork and British skirt steak tacos. No one really had a taste for the cactus and cheese tacos but we were happy to try something different. I also ordered a hibiscus margarita which was really nice. We were fabulously full when we left.When another friend and I revisited for lunch the following Monday the place was expectedly quieter. I was impressed with how quickly they brought us the food and the bill. It was a perfect place for a quick business style lunch given that my friend had to be back in the office within the hour. I again enjoyed the sweet potato and feta taquito and hibiscus margarita (I can drink on a Monday if I'm on vacation!!) and they were just as delectable a second time.I'd definitely make a point of returning to this location or trying another one the next time I'm in the UK. There was even nightclub downstairs for those who wanted to party up with tequila shots after their meal.",

The pork pilbil was my favorite of the 4 dishes we tried. We also ordered the ancho chicken taco, chicken avocado taquito and a chorizo and potato quesadilla. There was nothing wrong with the other dishes, they were tasty. We frequent Mexican restaurants back home and \u00a0were missing the heat and complexity of layered flavors. Again, not bad. Just alright. Our wait staff was really friendly and super busy. He could have used some help. All in all it was a good night.",

The food is really resonably priced and honestly some of the tastiest Mexican food I've ever had, with a really nice, relaxed atmosphere!We got the special of the day which was barbacoa (chilli beef) tacos with a side of sweet potato cubes and the sharing plate for two which consisted of 5 different dishes (perfect if you want to sample a few things from the menu) after starting with some guacamole and chips. Everything we had was amazing and we even went back for some more pork tacos before moving on to yummy desserts.This has been one of the best meals I've had over the past while, I honestly can't say a bad thing about the place! Go to Wahaca, eat yummy Mexican food and drink some delicious cocktails before heading to the downstairs bar and having a go on the swing! Go on, you know you want to!",

I don't go for the little tapas style dishes because I'm not fluent in the language of food share but I imagine they taste just like their larger counterparts so order ahead if mini \u00a0food is your thing! Tortilla chips and guacamole are a must! Their coleslaw is also pretty mind shatteringly awesome.Great cocktails but this is Soho, if you have the time to spare it's a better bet to look to nearby tried and tested bars for world class cocktails. If you're short for time you can pay the bill with their mobile app. It gets busy so it's worth considering.",

    "text": "Wahaca manages to achieve the almost impossible mission of success without decline. Each branch that opens has a slightly new take on the bright Mexican street food eatery selling healthy South American tapas and the best tequila in town, all at mega affordable prices.  I have never had a bad meal or a bad margherita at Wahaca. These guys know what they're doing. Whether it's a crunchy chicken ceaser tostada, a crispy sweet potato & feta taquito or a delicious pork pibl taco, the mini dishes are a dream. Load up and enjoy! The bigger dishes are great too, whether you're into fish tacos, burritos or a salad where you can literally eat the bowl, it's all great! Make sure you start off with THE best guacamole and chips, and end with the decadent churros with chocolate sauce to complete your Wahaca experience. And don't forget the tequila! This location is slightly larger than others, with a side bar and the chance to have a boogie!",

I'm ashamed to say that despite hearing many good things about them, I have never been in a branch of Wahaca before \u00a0more fool me. The Soho branch had a lovely rustic feel to it, and the downstairs bar was nice and cosy, with a variety of chairs (including some hanging basket seats that I wasn't brave enough to try sitting in). The staff were all wonderful to us - all happy to chat, recommend drinks, and lots of smiles - when people enjoy their jobs it really shows in the customer experience! I considered it my duty to try a number of the tequila cocktails: Mayan Gold \u00a0delicious and cinnamon-y; Passionfruit margarita nice and fruity; The Barragon which was a lovely refreshing grapefruit & lemonade concoction; and my favourite the deliciously crisp apple mojito \u00a0yum (can I have another?) And then the food. Oh wow! We were offered the following: broad bean & feta quesadillas \u00a0so creamy and perfect for sopping up alcohol; the black bean tostadas which exploded with flavour in my mouth; and saving the best for last, the pork pibil taco, which was everything is should be \u00a0juicy (or as I told my husband when I spilled some on my dress, leaky), spicy but absolutely full of flavour \u00a0if I have to go back for anything, it will be more of these. A lot more!",

I've been twice and both times the food was pretty good, but there's always something that prevents me from categorizing it as a 4 star place.I went today, we were a group of 5. We ordered guacamole to share and it was just OK - not sure how to make guac so flavorless but they managed. I also ordered the special of barbacoa tacos, which are 3 pretty small tacos with sopping wet meat. it was tasty, but really really salty (and i add extra salt to EVERYTHING). i had to eat it with the very bland guac to neutralize it. the chicken tostadas were actually pretty tasty. no complaints here - piled pretty high with ingredients and the flavors fit together well. it was like eating a salad more than anything since the tortilla was so tiny and thin. the side of frijoles - black beans with some cotija cheese and cream - was very good! very creamy. will be getting these again. Don't get the Mexican Hot Chocolate. It's dairy free because it's made with water and I felt like it was grainy, rich, but watered down nonetheless. I got the horchata last time I came and it was so so watery. blegh!It's a great place for groups to gather which is kind of rare in Soho, and there's plenty of options for everyone. I think it's probably a good place for people who haven't really had Mexican food. My Dutch friends absolutely loved it. I still miss my taco trucks in LA, and this doesn't really hit the spot.

Service was prompt, attentive, and sassy, and prices surprisngly reasonable for the upscale vibe. \u00a0Well done, Wahaca. \u00a0Now that I think of it, how could I possibly have thought it was Asian, when the very name sounds like you just bludgeoned a rattlesnake on a cactus plant with a machete on a hot desert day?

However I was excited to see a large variety and most of the meats I'm used to in this popular area of central London. They do some really interesting things, such as the Herron Tostada meal, and the burritos made with Indian-type (long grain) rice.The guacamole is tasty and the other sauces are spicy and fresh, including the chicken mole. The drinks are great too and a large menu is offered to accompany your meal. Maybe some of the dishes are quite small, but the explosive taste compensates for this slight issue.This place is the bomb. Don't say that in London though, you might get in trouble.",

We were there to see an episode of co-owner Thomasina Miers Mexican cooking show which is on Channel 5 at the moment and once we did that it was time for a few nibbles which were tasty as always.I've just made the salsa on the show and it's delicious.

The food is great, and apart from my recent chicken burrito which they admit still isn't quite right, I've never eaten badly there, and it's got a great atmosphere and nice decor. The problem is I think it's let down by the service. The time before last, the waitress was really pushy, trying to get us to order lots of side dishes and cocktails and such. She kept coming back and asking and it was quite annoying.Last time it was the opposite. The waitress was a bit inattentive and it took ages for her to come and ask if we were ok because we'd said we were waiting for some people. They did arrive and when it came to pay it took ages to get her attention to ask for the bill. I love the place otherwise, so it'd be 5 star if it wasn't for the service.",

We're from America where yummy Mexican offerings are on almost every corner and I wasn't disappointed. \u00a0The service was friendly and the space is bright and fun. We came for late lunch and had a great experience.",

    "text": "I remember the days when Southbank was a cultural gem and culinary wasteland. Now it has a good selection of both and Wahaca has become one of my faves. It is particularly great in summer as they have some outdoor seating overlooking the Thames.It was pouring down with rain on my last visit and you are more aware of sitting ina shipping container then. Still, the lovely Mexican food helps take away the chill - and no queues either.The concept is easy, you order a number of small plates to share and they arrive as and when the kitchen makes a new batch. Perfect for those who prefer a variety of tastes rather than a massive portion of just one dish.",

    "text": "Wahaca was a surprising choice for us tourists from California. Judging by Wahaca I would skip Mexican food in London in the future (which perhaps isn't fair to generalize a whole city but tough titties, London).The good: we had a nice view...The steak taco had way too much cabbage. The cabbage was marked a lack of authenticity to me. (I only ever see that on fish tacos. The rest of the time it's romaine all the way.) I had the sweet potato and feta taquito (yes, I know inauthentic - but the flavors sounded good). I liked the taquito itself but there was too much sauce drizzled on the plate. The feta of the taquito was on the shredded lettuce on the side, which was disappointing. I thought it would be inside the taquito. It was good overall but not great.My chorizo and potato quesadilla was the lowest point of the meal. The chorizo flavor was a little off for me. Plus, they added chorizo oil to it so the whole thing was a dripping red mess.The kids had the quesadilla kids' meals, which came with veggies and hibiscus aqua frescas. I was pleased that aqua frescas made it across the pond.",

The quesadillas could've had more flavor and were bland tasting. We also ordered some guacamole and that was eh as well.

The food is your basic UK version of \"Mexican fare\" including margaritas, quesadillas, and guac but it isn't as bad as I thought. Although food lacks spice or authenticity it is a good option for people who looking for a classic \"queso and margaritas\" kind of Mexican brunch food. If your looking for traditional Latin food this is not the place. But if your looking for a trendy take on Latin, like pomegranate margaritas, with a fun atmosphere then it may be the place for you. As a bonus, the restaurant gives complimentary chile pepper seed to plant in your own garden!",

I loved the colours and the quirky drawings on the wall and was drawn in.Inside I saw that it was a fun place with lots of different seating options etc. Since I was dining alone I sat by the window. Which was a great idea - way to deal with my curios side and also to charge my phone (when a tourist with a phone as the only means, you can run out of battery).The waiter (Jorge) came quickly and took my drink order. I had to try the vanilla and passion fruit mohito., Yummy! And of course I had to have a beer as well. Both came quickly. As for food, I decided to go for the pork pibil. Pork in tortilla with some spicy red onions. Even though it was a little bit messy, it had a good deal of flavor to it. Ok priced, loved the decor, food and drinks tasted good and service was good and quick! Bonus for extra chili seeds to grow at home.Absolutely I place I would visit again for some drinks and some tacos!:)",

Here are my thoughts:Service is very friendly but our waiter clearly had too many tables and was running around, so we waited a LONG time for him to take our order. Unfortunately we finally had to flag down another server to take our order, who was happy enough to assist.Food is overall pretty good. Guacamole is tasty, prawn tacos were good, steak tacos were a bit chewy (according to mini-me), vegetarian tostada was good, rice and beans was so good we ordered a second and demolished that one too.Prices were reasonable for London.The bottom line: Wahaca can't hold a candle to Mexican food in LA but it's definitely good by London standards. We'll return I'm sure.",

My friend didn't want tacos so the two orders of tacos for me were only a pound each! I got their signature pork tacos and plantain tacos. The pork tacos were nothing to write home about (hence the loss of one star) but the plaintain tacos were awesome. I'm from California so I know Mexican food. And I'm also a sucker for plantains. Personally I wish that I had gotten two orders of the plantain tacos instead, but I'll know for next time. The tacos were on the small side though so I probably wouldn't order it if it hadn't been only a pound - I'm a burrito type of girl anyway",

We are a couple of vegetarians, which was great because there were tons and tons of options. Being from the states, we are very familiar with Mexican food. I must say, Wahaca did not disappoint. The veggie tacos and taquitos were out-of-this-world. Carlos highly recommended the side of sweet potatoes. They were hands down the best thing I've ever eaten. He said that the employees were too addicted, so they're not allowed to eat them anymore.Go. Get a margarita. Order a side of sweet potatoes. Ask for Carlos. You'll thank me.",

Its a great place to come with friends for a tapas-like experience of tasting many dishes and sharing across the table. Try the Chicken Taquitos and the Chorizo & Potato Quesadilla. For a bit of a larger plate, try the Slow-cooked Pork Burrito with a dab of the habanero salsa that is bottled on the table if you like a strong spice! Make sure to try their many flavors of margaritas with your meal, especially the Passion Fruit Margarita, which is divine! Drink it slowly though! It tastes so sweet and fruity you could forget that there is alcohol in it.",

    "text": "No, this is not the way to introduce Londoners (or anyone, who hasn't lived in America) to Mexican food. Do it the American way. Get them to eat Taco Bell, hangover quesadillas and then gourmet up a cuisine which has had some marinade-time with the local palette. After living in London for over four years I am still not convinced that this is a popular cuisine. And Mexican food is certainly not top of the mind comfort food, so I have observed. While Wahaca does not do a bad job at the food, it doesn't do justice to the presentation. The restaurant has a distinctly different feel when you compare it to an average or above average Mexican restaurant in the US (I haven't been to Mexico). If I didn't know better I would have thought that this was a fancy American diner.The food is well portioned and there's little chance that you will go home hungry. The flavours are not super authentic and there seems to be a deliberate attempt at a hint of affected fusion. I'll go back but this is not one I will think of if I have to recommend Mexican food.",

So that's me covered. So some garishly painted sea containers plonked on one of Londons finest examples of brutalist architecture meant I was pissed off and not going to take part in their tex mex reinvented offering. However hunger and a few days holiday relaxed my cranky views and with my tolerant wife we entered the Wahaca tin boxes.Service, at 12.20, was quick friendly and helpful. Seated upstairs the view and interior on a sunny day felt quite nice. It was all quite nice. The food, a selection of sharing dishes, were all three yelp stars OK. I'm no Mexican food expert but I just found Wacacha's offerings a little bland. I love chilli but not when you have to add it yourself from an own brand - available in a supermarket near you - bottle of chilli sauce with overpowering notes of vinegar. It's like a old fashioned cafe where you smother the food in cheap tomato sauce to give it flavour. Finally we went for a little dessert. We customised their vanilla ice cream with nuts and caramel topping to peanut butter ice cream with the toppings. The mean three scoops arrived with nuts but no caramel. The ice cream had formed large crystals, the ultimate ice cream sin. Service was very good and I tipped suitably. Other people love it.",

The staff are very friendly and helpful and the downstairs bar is a great place to have a couple of pre-dinner drinks if you have to wait for a table. You really cannot go wrong with their food selection. I prefer to share a number of the smaller dishes instead of having one large dish. The menus and specials change regularly but I can recommend at least one Modelo beer 'Michelada', the Frijoles to start and the Quesadillas are particularly good. Fresh, simple food that's well presented in a fantastic atmosphere!",

In the heart of Soho there is inconspicuous from outside but admirable from inside restaurant. It's always full of people but the friendly staff will surely find you a table.The idea of this place is to taste a couple of mexican dishes instead of getting a full one. Personally I've tried a pork bill tacos, chicken quajillo tostadas and chipotle chicken quesadillas. The first one i can higly recommend. Remind that most of the dishes are very spicey so they give you a free water which is reasonable and quite nice.It's pricey \u00a0to taste a mexican food here, especially because the portions aren't very big, but for sure you won't regret.",

Queue up because this place is positively worth the wait. You can also keep your hands busy with their strong and good margaritas while you wait. This place is fresh, vibrant, and fun. The standouts were the chorizo and potato quesadilla (delightfully smoky) and the pork pibil tacos (so scrumptious). They give you a large amount of food for little plates and appetizers. We were stuffed to the gills, but I kept eating. We were not fans of the queso fundido. I, the adventurous one, ate the cactus it came with and was not impressed. It tasted like a salty stalk of boiled broccoli. I'm sure cactus could be good if they doctored it up a bit. I also liked the ferociously spicy trio of sauces the chips came with. Very fun place. Hit it up if you're jonesing for some Mexican in Britishland.",

Only real downside, service poor... really poor. Over the course of an hour prob saw our server twice and two wrong orders (food item was right... but no avocado turned into no anything on 2 of the 4 burritos... huh?).I would go back... food would rank 4 stars but the service knocked it down a star. Make it a little warmer and more comfortable... even better. If you go, pass on the dessert and go to the high-end chocolate place in covenant gardens (don't recall name) and get the chocolate Gelato that was out of this world good.",

We had an hour wait for a table, so they sent us downstairs to the bar area. Seating was a bit tight down there as well, but we were able to share a table with some people and we sampled a couple different margaritas. I started out with the Tamarind Margarita, which was really good, but I slurped it down in 3 sips, they put A LOT of ice in the small glass, \u00a35.95 each, you can easily rack up a large bill! They also serve chips, salsa and guac downstairs while you're waiting for your table. After a couple rounds we were starving and headed upstairs, our waitress was very attentive and gave a couple recomendations for us, we ordered the Pork Pibil, Plaintain Tacos and the MSC fish a la Pimienta (we chose fried, not grilled fish). Everything was delicious, but the standout was the Michelada. It was like liquid gold, you have to try this if you like spicy cocktails. Don't come if you're in a hurry, this place was worth the wait.",

I mean, relative to the rest of the food in London and the surrounding areas, Wahaca was a five star joint, relative to the heavy greasy pub food. Nothing here was slathered in sauce and deep fried to death. This restaurant saved my Paleo life. The food served here is locally sustained (at least that is what their menu says) and it was pretty good! I have to say I am in love with their unique pairing of scratchings (fluffy pork rinds) and guacamole. Love. I mean, I could eat that combo all freakin day. I never thought to put the two together! Wahaca, in American terms is like if Whole foods owned Chevy's. It's mostly healthy and they were able to alter the menu for me and food is locally grown. No SF style large mouth watering burritos here but the British steak taco's are not bad at all.Yea. I went here 3 times during my stay in the UK. They are a chain restaurant and I'm OK with that. I do love the \"after meal\" treats they give. They are ancho chili seeds in a matchbook. How awesome!",

    "text": "Since moving from Manchester I have been rather grumpy about my eating out options. For the most part, my experience had been defined by bad service, expensive dishes and waiters keen to give you the bill as soon as you have sat down. I missed my old favourites and nothing could be found to rival them. At least until I discovered Wahaca. Admittedly I was rather keen to try Thomasina Miers' restaurants. I have the cookbooks at home and having made a few of the dishes myself they have always been pleasantly received. What sets this style of Mexican apart is the wondrous amount of Fresh ingredients used. It's a world away from Old Del Passo/ chiquittos, where at best you may find a soggy red pepper hidden in layers of cheese.Okay, it's no reservations, but as this is London on a Friday night there is about a 1 hour wait to get a table. Luckily the bar is fantastic. We decided that it was somewhere we would go even if we weren't being made to wait there. The cocktails were divine, as sugary alcohol-y cocktails always are. I sampled a Paloma which was wonderfully fruity and light. The boyfriend, ever the adventurer, had his standard Corona which apparently was \"very competitively priced for London\"; a very big compliment indeed.The service is snappy. You are warned that all your dishes will arrive at different times so best to get a bit of everything. All of the street food dishes are around 4 pounds each, but there are also bigger dishes prices at around 8 pounds, great for a solo lunch. Some of our favorites were the Chorizo and potato Quesadillas, the chorizo had a great flavour and not too heavy considering what they contained. Classic pork pil pil tacos were updated with a lovely onion relish. We hadn't tried taquitos before, but of course anything with a description that includes the words 'deep fried' has to be tried. This is where you begin to be glad the portions are small.All in all Wahaca is a perfect example of Mexican street food at its best. I think this would be the perfect place for a first date; it's loud, trendy, the food is crying out to be shared, and if things aren't going so well the speedy table service means you can always make a quick exit...",

On arrival we were met by the friendliest and rather flirty staff, who were quite happy for us to head downstairs to sample a few of the tequila based cocktails first and develop an appetite before ordering any food which we did about an hour later. So, when we tipsily heading back to the dining area at 7.30 although the place was heaving, we were immediately shown to a table, perfect!The menu's are printed on the placemats, and with so much too chose from, you can have a whole range of dishes, a bit like Tapas, with Tortillas, Tacos, Enchiladas, Tamales and a whole range of rices, guacamoles and tortas. We all went for the sharing plates, and for \u00a320 for two, there was more than enough to satisfy us. \u00a0Oh, and leave room for Thomasina's Cheesecake with Hibiscus, one of the best cheesecakes ive ever eaten!But back to the Tequila bar . . \u00a0and we most definitely did return here after our meal. Set out like a Mexican square, the bar in located in the corner with very knowledgable staff in all things related to the Agave plant. \u00a0Great seating, including chairs swinging from the ceiling and who can resist that after a Tequila Sour or two, and a couple of fuss-ball tables for those still able to stand. Snacks are also available down in the bar, so plates of guacamole and tortillas were always making their way round.All that and everyone leaves with a small packet of Chili seeds to grown at home, whats not to love!",

    "text": "I've been to a Wahaca once a few years ago and wasn't incredibly impressed by it. Finally years later I went again and I enjoyed it much more! We had to wait to be seated on a Monday evening but it was only about 10 minutes, and we were able to get a drink at the bar while we waited. The drinks are fantastic, quite strong, and they're a good price, so even if you're not into the food, you'll want to go for the tequila cocktails.The majority of the food that I had was really good. There are definitely those things that stand out, like the pork pibil tacos and the plantain tacos (though can't they have some fried plantain as a side? PLEASE?), and those that are just okay, like the black bean quesadillas. It's definitely a good idea to share with friends so that you get a good range of choices, since it can be hit and miss. We had great service, quick but friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is great, and so relaxed, which is how I like it. My Texan friend with a Mexican partner said while it wasn't as good as home, it was still very good, so it's a solid choice for Mexican in London.",

    "text": "I'm pretty skeptical about any ethnic food coming out of the UK besides Indian food or kebabs... but after a few friends from Mexico told me this place \"isn't bad\", I decided to give it a try! \u00a0The atmosphere is definitely fun when you walk in, and it is extremely modern and a bit European-ized.We had a party of 4 and ordered a variety of dishes to share. \u00a0We started off with some guacamole and chips, and the Wahaca Selection, which included tacos, quesadillas, tostadas, and taquitios. \u00a0The tacos and taquitos were definitely the highlights of the selections, and the tostadas were forgettable. \u00a0The tortillas on the soft tacos were sooo soft! \u00a0I was definitely surprised! \u00a0We also ordered the Chicken Mole Enchiladas as well as the Pork Tacos, and everything was GREAT, and actually too much food for all of us to finish! \u00a0To be fair, I haven't had authentic Mexican food in a few months and the closest thing I've had was Chipotle in Tottenham Court Road (which is ridiculously over-priced, under-sized, and just generally sub-par), so I had nothing to really compare the food to. \u00a0But it definitely satisfied me in the moment!Afterwards, we headed downstairs where the bar is and kind of went crazy with the tequila shots and the fooseball table! I liked that there was a tequila and margaritas bar! There was lots of space and was relatively empty for a Saturday afternoon, and even though I have to say those tequila shots are kinda pricey coming from Los Angeles where tequila is basically the price of water, we had a really great time just hanging out and enjoying the chill atmosphere, and we got way too caught up in the foose-ball action to really notice anything otherwise. \u00a0We ran up a bill of about \u00a375 for 4 people, which is a bit extreme in my opinion for four rounds.I like that all the plates at Wahaca are small and are great for sharing and tasting, and it is pretty authentic for London and I wouldn't expect anything more or less. I'll be back!",

I do think the guacamole always needs more lime. Had to ask for extra a few times, but maybe that's my personal preference. I don't think the burritos are all that. They are good but Freebird is better. What I do like and what they do excel is is the tequila and the pork tacos. Both are the only things I order when I go there now. I once had 15 tacos in one sitting it was so addictive (I must have been hungry!). The Soho branch is much bigger though both have queues most of the time on weekends. But the staff are really great.",

This place completely change the way I think about Mexican cuisine. It can be super fresh and healthy.The 'street food' section is absolutely amazing. Their signature pork pibilos (just ask for signature pork street dish!) with black beans and onions alone worth a visit. Fresh green & spelt salad is so delicious they must add some other (magical) ingredients to make it taste so lovely.Grilled cactus is bursting with juice as you bite into it and other food (yes, I went there on a Friday day and after a few cocktails I lost count of what we had) - is just amazing.The place has good trendy and informal ambience - so good for all sorts of occasions. Downstairs they have a bar, so if you need to wait for your table - they serve some mean tequilas down there.Oh and the service is SUPER quick and attentive. Literally as you place it, sometimes they would bring you the first food you've ordered.Coming from a person who used to say 'I don't like Mexican food' these 5 stars should really be 6.",

The price is reasonable, the quantities are filling, and the food is delicious!To start we got the chips and guacamole: Great!I had the British Steak plate with green rice. The steak was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo tasty. Not to mention that corn relish...My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The green rice that came with it was also mouth-watering. The dish also had soft tacos that came with it. I had a taste of their pulled pork taco, which wasn't too bad. Apparently their fish tacos and their cheese and bean quesadilla are also very good.A great bar also exists downstairs, so if you have to wait for a seat or want to stay after dinner, it is a great place to be with cool hanging chairs and fooseball tables.",

Friends and I tucked in for a Tequila Tuesday when another place fell through, and I had a great time sitting at the elevated center booth. I felt like a celebrity for our location and ability to look down on everyone else. It's not condescending when it's just where they sat you in the restaurant, right? Also the chiquita banana lamp was awesome.For food, I had a few of my normal fare: chips and guacamole, chicken taquitos, and the chipotle chicken quesadilla. They're the same standard as any other Wahaca I've been to, which is to say quite good. I also had my passionfruit maragarita to set the whole thing off.To be fair, we didn't have the greatest service, which is why I lowered this to three stars. It was super busy (for a Tuesday? or ever?) and I just felt like it took ages to get things like water, or to place our orders. There were empty tables though, and our food came out of the kitchen really quickly (like it does at all Wahacas), so I'm not sure what was going on. Otherwise, another good Wahaca experience to check off the list!",

This Mexican market style restaurant has come up around London at the perfect time. Everyone is going crazy for tapas style food right now; there's something so sociable about it, grabbing a few dishes and throwing them in the middle for everyone to pick at over wine and good quality gossip. Or the idea that you can try lots of little things and broaden your culinary horizons.Or maybe it's just my group of friends that can no longer be jealous of what anyone else is having, because we're all having the same! Whatever your motives, if you're into sharing and caring them try this place!I've been to half a dozen of these restaurants in London now, but picked this one to write my main review because it's definitely my favourite. So laidback, yet busy. So relaxed yet it feels like a treat. Of course mix this with a margarita and what's not to love! Came here with a friend at peak time, so we grabbed one of the last spots on window seats, perfect for peoplewatching (my favourite pasttime!) We split all the best yummy treats Wahaca can offer - pork pibil, tostadas, tacitos, quesadillas and some amazing smoky, spicy sweet potatoes. SO GOOD.",

While admittedly I can only comment on their winter burrito, unfortunately there isn't really very much to comment about it. It was a passable burrito, presented in a strange rectangular rather than cylindrical form, and was neither particularly favourful or memorable. However, what really annoyed me about this restaurant was their music. Oh my days, their music was annoying. Blasted out of tinny little overhead speakers (which, very conveniently happened to be right by our table), someone, at some point decided it would be a great idea to play cheese Mariachi band music... all the time. Not only cheesy, but also loud, it wouldn't be an understatement to say the music pretty much ruined my whole dining experience. In addition, their waitstaff is awful - my friend asked for her burrito without avocado, and I asked for no tortilla chips with mine. Our server assured us this could be done, and proceeded to bring us our food, avocado and tortilla chips included. Although after pointing this out they got it right the second time around, it meant we had to wait longer, and were subjected to that godawful music for longer. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here anytime soon (read: ever).",

Having been a regular at the Westfield branch and always enjoyed the mostly very good food and always reasonable prices I was excited that a branch was opening near my office. I waited for it to open and visited with a colleague a soon as it did. It's really a transformation of what I'm sure used to be Cap Gemini reception. Striking and open plan it's an attractive look and really will stand our amongst it's Wardour Street competitors.The service is always cheery if occasionally overstretched. Tasty guacamole and chips are always a good place to start.I have a few regular dishes which I nearly always order and always taste the same, which in this context is positive. Chorizo and Potato Quesadilla, Chicken Taquitos, Beans with Cheese and Green Rice. All of these were great examples of what Wahaca can do, tasty, fresh. The Taquitos in particular were great, crispy, salty, cheesy, fresh, chewy and brilliant collection of textures and flavours.The downstairs bar is great addition, can never go wrong with a Hibiscus margarita whilst waiting for a table upstairs.",

So much so, I ate Mexican food for a week before uprooting from California and moving to London. Wow, that sounds considerably less cool than I thought it would. Anywho, Wahaca, I think, is the closest replica to the real deal as I've found in this city (but please let me know if there's a better one! I will buy you a margarita in thanks!) I slightly prefer the food truck out front as far as authentic eats go, but the plates are tasty and interesting without that try-hard feel.Highlights - I'm a big fan of the chicken tinga tacos. The hot sauces! I bought them both. The guacamole is so so so good, and two thumbs up for the hibiscus margarita. Lowlights - I would skip the cactus tacos next time, and the fish tacos were just so-so. I'd love to see them try a non-breaded fish taco. The mid-week hour-long wait for a table isn't ideal but it gives you time to grab a margarita and some guacamole and chips.Love the location - overlooking the Thames - and the shipping container structure. They said it's only supposed to stick around for 18 months, but last time I was there one of the bartenders mentioned that its popularity has them considering keeping it open for longer. Yay! PS - The seed matchbooks have produced 5 habanero plants, and I've got some promising serrano chili plants as well. Horticulture for the win!",

I went in on a Saturday night around 9pm so I was doubtful if we were even going to get a table, but we were greeted politely at the door and given an eta of 45-60min (not too bad I thought). In the end we waited maybe 30 minutes for our table which went by so fast we didn't even have time to finish our delicious Hibiscus Mojitos in the downstairs bar before the alarm went off in our buzzer. The lady who took us to our table seemed a little rude and uninterested, but otherwise the staff was great! I absolutely love the \"Street Food\" section on the menu and ordered 3 things from there - all delicious and divine! You can't really go wrong here no matter what you order. The food came really fast (as it always does) even though the restaurant was fully booked. Our lovely waitress recommended the Hibiscus Margarita for me and it was ridiculously amazing, maybe even better than the Mojito. All and all the night was a success, which (to be frank) I've become to expect in a Wahaca anyway :)",

Waited 10 minutes at the bar (only 1 barman serving), 15 minutes later a table was available. Glad I stayed :)Service was friendly and the food came quite quickly. I had ordered steak tacos, sweet potato taquitos and black bean quesadillas. The steak was tender, quesadillas were made tastier with some of the hot and fruity sauce. There was a mix up with the order and I got the sweet potato side (looked very small, maybe 4 pieces). I asked for the taquitos instead and the waitress was swift and pleasant in rectifying this. I found the taquitos quite strange in texture (blue corn tortillas were chewy in places and crispy in others) but the taste of the sweet potato filling was delicious, and the fresh lettuce and tomato topping was fresh and perfectly complementary.Reasonably priced with small dishes and most drinks averaging at about \u00a34 each. Service was warm and efficient. I left feeling full and satisfied but not heavy or stuffed. Would definitely recommend.",

Also had a burrito and the combo plate amongst the group, all of which were worth ordering. Guacamole was decent but the pork cracklings that came with it more than made up for the average guac. Classic margarita was just that, simple and excellent. Lime, tequila, and triple sec.Plus a rarity in my (limited) experience in England, they had hot sauce that was actually hot!Service was attentive and generally very good. They brought a Modelo Especial rather than the requested Negro Modelo, but fixed their mistake quickly and took the less tasty Especial off the bill even though it was half gone by the time they realized the problem. Only downside to the place is you realize you're in London when the check shows up. 60GBP for 2.5 so not crazy expensive, but not Cali cheap.",

It is hot, it's is lively (you will hardly get in w/o the reservation, practically all evenings are busy there, it is Soho!!!), the food is great, fresh, colorful, real Mexican style, as were the cocktails. Don't drink wine here, it is not the best you could imagine and it comes in mustard glasses, phh! A special tip: A small farewell gift are not the matches, but a small pack of Serrano chillies seeds which looks like matches. Don't forget to grow Wahaca chillies in your home! Address: Wahaca - Mexican market eating - Soho London, 80 Wardour Street, London W1F OTF, +44 207 734 0195)Summary in the Czech language: Skvele misto v londynskem Soho na barevnou mexickou veceri s kamarady. Vsechno skvele, ceny OK, jen si nedavejte vino. A jako darek na rozloucenou poproste o malou cervenou krabicku - vypada jako krabicka od sirek, ale jsou v ni seminka chilli papricek!",

The tomatillo sauce has tons of flavour with a nice kick too.And ask for Eric as your waiter! He has a very outgoing personality and will give you great service",

I figured I loved the pork tacos, so the burrito should be nice. \u00a0I also ordered a side of the roasted sweet potatoes. \u00a0The sweet potatoes are fantastic and a MUST! \u00a0The tortilla chips on my plate were stale and could have used more pico de gallo. \u00a0The burrito... well the pork was lovely and I love the pickled onions (beware they do have a spicy kick to them), but combining them with the black beans and green rice didn't do it for me. \u00a0The nice thing is that the burrito is so big, that I cut it open and picked what I wanted and still managed to get full. \u00a0I think the Covent Garden location is still my favourite and I think the sharing plates are better options!",

    "text": "I'm from Texas so I was definitely curious to see how Wahaca would compare to the Tex-Mex and Mexican food I'm used to from home. I tried the pork pibil tacos, the black beans & cheese quesadilla, and a margarita. I LOVED the pork pibil tacos. They were the perfect size and all of the flavors worked really well together. The black beans & cheese quesadilla was not the greatest...really plain and boring and it definitely lacked flavor. I was not the biggest \u00a0fan of the margarita either...I couldn't finish it! I think it was a bit too strong.Overall I had a pretty good experience there and would go back the next time I'm in London to get more of those pork tacos!",

    "text": "After almost three years of living in London, I finally made it to a Wahaca. In my head I imagined it to be terrible because there are several locations, but I still wanted to try it. I also thought it would be terrible as the people who own it clearly don't know how to spell Oaxaca, and when I lived in the states I had lovely experiences at an authentic Oaxacan restaurant, so I just figured it wouldn't meet my expectations. So the food. We ordered a lot of stuff. All the tacos, the guacamole with pork scratchings, the beans and chips, two types of quesadilla and some taquitos. I was actually quite impressed with the flavors of all of them. It was extremely tasty. The drinks though, left a lot to be desired. They just seemed a bit well, weak. We ordered a round at the bar to start, and those were nice, but after that they just all fell flat. So that was disappointing. The service was also disappointing. We ordered food and drinks and the server never came back it seemed. I had to stop her once for more napkins and we had to stop her again to order more of their less than stellar drinks.The other thing that frightened me is that Nava wanted to try one of the sauces. She shook it up, and went to open it and somehow it was under amazing pressure because it sprayed everywhere. It was a bit strange. So she sealed \u00a0it back up and cleaned up (hence the extra napkins). I decided to give it another go, and I opened it (this time holding a napkin over the top of the bottle) and it still sprayed. Then to my dismay, the sauce started bubbling out of the top of the bottle like the bottle was some sort of volcano. I put the bottle down, but more and more sauce was spilling out of the top. What kind of hot sauce does that? Had it gone bad? I don't know, but it frightened me and I definitely didn't try it after that.So given the lack of alcohol in the drinks and the exploding hot sauce incident and the lack of service, Wahaca won't be back on my list of places to return. But if you want to try a London chain with better than average Mexican food, give it a whirl.",
