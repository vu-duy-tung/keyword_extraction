Its not like a staple french salad can be wrong in a French place, but it just wasnt fabulous.Shame really as the place looks amazing and the staff are truely delightful in that understated, elegant, and not standoffish way. There when you wanted them, gone when you didnt. Perhaps a romantic tryst kind of place rather than business meeting I was at? I'll probably go back and experience dinner at some point.",

The three receptionists seemed more interested in themselves and eye rolling at our questions. The waiting staff were exceptional though. Very knowledgeable and directed us to an excellent Albarino. On this note we were very impressed with the wine prices and that you can get a 250ml carafe. The food though was a little disappointing. The first course a winter vegetable soup was a good start but the fish main a little dull and the 'floating island' dessert to be avoided. Wish we had gone for the impressive cheese board instead. The decor though is fabulous... would have given it 3 star otherwise.",

    "text": "For me the best part of the lunch at Les Deux Salons was the service. I wanted to like the place but I was a bit underwhelmed. I feel a bit like I'm the only one who feels this way reading how happy others are with the place. As much as I loved my meal at Arbutus for me Les Deux Salons was just OK, sometimes good, but never more. Where were the sparks? I demand sparks! Well, at least something extra for the price I paid. The autumn wild mushrooms and clarence court poached egg on toast as a starter really made the meal for me. Maybe because I grew up with mushrooms and just love them and also that it reminds me of the breakfast I normally make for weekends, just a thousand times better. As for the main, having heard about the Josper I wanted to try how the food cooked in it would be. I settled for the bavette of scottish beef with shallot sauce. Now, I have to say, excellent meat, nicely cooked, really tasty sauce and excellent presentation. It's just that the word to describe it was nice. Wish it had been more than that. One problem in general was the lack of seasoning. Les Deux Salons, you don't have salt?! The place is fantastic, the food is very good and the service I got for the lunch service was almost flawless. In the end it comes down to whether it was worth it and for the set menu it could be but I didn't feel it was for \u00e0 la carte.",

Even the bathrooms were in exquisite taste.The warm welcome from behind the big red velvet curtain was familiar from visits to Arbutus and Wild Honey, as was the big cheese platter, oozing with sweaty French numbers and cold, flinty Dutch harlots.The menu reads fantastically; typical French bistro style with andouilettes, duck, rillettes, bavette steak etc.The sherry was cool, syrupy and promised of more, much more for the end of the night. (Yes, I drink fucking sherry. All the time)And then, and then. Just as I was getting a little over-excited, it all crumbled.The first signs that the sexy woman in your hands was in fact a hairy-kneed slob was the service. Lots of staff milling around, but we never got the sense that any of them were that dedicated to getting us any food.One girl poured new wine into old wine, tap water into a glass of bottled and spilled a little every time she poured. I'm \u00a0sorry if that sounds too much like a first-world whinge, but really. This is page one, chapter one of serving tables.The food when it came was mostly great - gelatinous breast of veal was delicious, as was the neck of lamb. But the rabbit with chorizos was dry and cobbled together and our cheese course was an absolute shambles. One slice of chilled soft cheese with no fruit.I will go again, because I have had too many good meals at Wild Honey not to, and because the restaurant is achingly gorgeous. Hopefully my next visit will result in lush, tender passion, not stale, fetid gropes behind the bus shelter.",

    "text": "After recently seeing this place as number 2 on the hot list of London restaurants and taking a look at their menu and realizing it wasn't as expensive as every other place on the list (see Dinner, Hakkasan, Savoy Grill), I just had to give it a try.First off, I have to say I think it's a bit over rated. \u00a0I'll wax on about the things I liked about this place in a moment but I definitely didn't like their Oysters which were simply not prepared/open correctly as we'd place it into our mouths only to discover bits of shell. \u00a0Not only making you not want to swallow it straight up but actually turning the stomach a bit as well. \u00a0The french fried side was bland and with the days of triple fried/duck fat/truffle oil chip, they could certainly get a bit more creatrive with it. \u00a0Service was fine but nothing spectacular either, had to wait an unusual amount of time between starter and entree but neither of these things will deter me from coming back.The good, the restaurant is decorated a lovely Parisian brasserie art deco style, love the booths and curves. Wine menu is surprisingly affordable and the steak tartare appetizer (can also be ordered as a main) was absolutely delicious. \u00a0One of the best I've had in awhile and I do like it quite a bit so it's good to discover a place in London that prepares it just right on to my taste. My main course, the bavette with caramelized onions was delicious, even if you like your meat more rare than medium-rare, trust me the recommended medium rare will do. \u00a0Really it was a rare delicious meal apart from the Oysters, so if you like french fare, I definitely recommend checking it out.",

    "text": "I quite liked this restaurant, despite a few short comings.First, the shortcomings. \u00a0A bit noisy, very close to drunkish bars around Charing Cross Station, and a sense of urgency as if your table will be needed soon despite that not being the case. \u00a0Large and not so intimate, several dining levels with even some private dining rooms -- a warehouse of dining experience under one roof.Now the good bits. \u00a0The menu is excellent if you are in search of traditional French cuisine, and the waiters are well versed in the wine list. \u00a0I'm a beer guy and they are very limited in that area but no matter.The starters are average -- I would just order the butter leaf salad as it was excellent and large and good value for money. \u00a0The 'Snail Pot Pie' looked like something from Kentucky \u00a0Fried Chicken and was soupy on the inside. \u00a0I don't eat that stuff so maybe I'm not the right guy to complain.The mains are great portion size, but the prices are definitely high street. \u00a0Expect to pay about 30-40 per person for food not including wine and cocktails.The desserts were lovely, I opted for a medley of berries with chantilly cream, but I tasted several other and they were pretty decent.I don't think large places are well suited for intimate French menus, perhaps the food was better than the place affords it, but overall I give it 4/5 for being above the cut and doing a great job in a challenging London location.",

    "text": "Les Deux Salon opened its doors last year. A sibling to Arbutus and Wild Honey, I was looking forward to it after a glowing review which placed dreamy \u00a0notions in my head of a dessert known as Floating Island. With a friend's turn of the decade birthday coming up and a celebration venue was in order, we decided to head to Les Deux Salon. The decor exudes a muted charmed elegance and while waiting for the rest of the party to arrive, it gave me time to soak in the ambience. After placing our orders, I could see the place getting busier as the minutes passed. I don't remember much about the dishes that was ordered as it was a birthday celebration. Forgive me as I was distracted, so I could only show the photos. I do however remember my dessert though. What did i get for dessert? The Floating Island of course. It arrived and was just the most exquisite and pretty looking dessert. A meringue that was so light that it was floating and bobbing slightly in the pool of vanilla custard. The meringue just vanishes and melts in your mouth leaving a slight trace of sweetness from the cream. The cream itself was light and not overly sweet. I am in love with this. Throughout the whole dinner, service was quite absent. I could see our waiter but he hardly looked over to our table to check on us. Is it because they were busy or we had a corner table? But how do you explain when our water was only refilled twice and it was sitting empty for at least 15-20 minutes many a time and frantic waving of the arms was not successful either. In addition, I could see him topping up a glass that was still half full two tables away. I managed to catch the attention of someone else who was setting up an empty table and after notifying her of our request, she nodded and proceeded to continue to set the table. Another ten minutes later and it was clearly forgotten again. What IS going on here?!Enough ranting. As we were there to celebrate a birthday, we made a request earlier to have the slice of cake taken out at the end and presented to the birthday girl. It arrived and we sang and then we stared. We could only stare as no cutlery was given for her to eat the cake. If I wasn't cheesed off by the service, I would have laughed. Am at a loss for words. Les Deux Salon, you make good food but the service is sorely lacking.",

Fortunately for us you couldn't get much more of a transformation.I think it's brave of the Arbutus boys to open a restaurant in this building.Despite being within a stones throw of Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden, the immediate environs don't scream classy dining. I think this actually adds to the magic when you enter as they have created a really vibrant French bistro style room.The waiters here are all spectacularly friendly. They were recommending dishes and supplying small bits of conversation between courses that were well judged and not at all intrusive. I think they were exclusively French as well.The food is good. In fact, I think it's very good but doesn't quite hit amazing. The Fois Grois terrine was one of the most delicious things I tasted last year. The main courses were pretty standard, but the floating island for desert was amazing. I spent the whole meal sat opposite a cheese board that looked pretty good but just didn't have room for it.The wine list is pretty comprehensive and there is a good range of prices. In fact we had a small carafe of a very pleasant wine for not a lot of money.",

I had a great Negroni and several delicious wines. My friend and I had the pre theatre menu, excellent price of \u00a315 for 3 courses. The food was good, though I feel that Arbutus has the edge. What did let the evening down was the service. It was relatively quiet when we arrived at 5:30, and started getting busy around 6:30. Much effort was needed to order, throughout the meal. We seemed to have several different waiters for our table, which you would think would help matters, but didn't. Several orders were made to one person and delivered by another.Considering this, I will in future, return to Arbutus, where the service is more personal, where I can enjoy a fine meal in a tranquil environment.",

    "text": "The third in the family from Anthony Demetre, the chef behind low key Michelin starred joints Wild Honey and Arbutus, was always going to get my interest. I've had some great meals at the other two and was excited to hear about the plans for a larger, more classically French bistro just off St Martin's Lane. Like one of my other big current favourites, the Dean Street Townhouse, Les Deux Salons is housed in a former Pitcher and Piano and my god, is it an improvement. While they may not have the deep pockets of Caprice Holdings, the team behind Les Deux Salons have done a great job turning the large, cavernous space into an elegant French bistro. Deep red banquettes, blacks and whites and elegant brasses go with the formality of the linen table cloths and the bustling smart floor team. It's a big room, with further covers on the mezzanine level, and they'll have to go some to fill it on every service, but on this showing, I think they're in with a fighting chance, even if the mezzanine level isn't open often. It's a classic bistro menu, with a large nod to their Josper Grill (an ultra hot Spanish machine drooled over by chefs nationwide) and a Gallic sneer towards the vegetarians - a couple of salads and a solitary (though very fine) pasta dish complete the meat free line up. A particularly fine looking bavette (or flank steak) arrives on the next table, joining a Scottish beefburger that comes in at \u00a312 and pretty much guarantees my return visit. We go for the very good value \u00a315 set menu and slip in the orecchiette pasta as a shared course after the starter. It's almost a step too far.The white bean and smoked duck soup I start with is OK, but to be honest, it's nothing special. I can't taste the duck at all and the bean is a little chalky. The Vole's chunky country terrine is a much better option, full of flavoursome nuggets of melting fat. Fresh orecchiette pasta comes in a creamy sauce with artichokes, pecorino, kale and pine nuts and is exceptional. Well cooked, well seasoned and with individual flavours that really shine through. Simple but very well thought through. Even more simpler is the braised shoulder of venison served with a parsnip puree that follows as my main. It's a big portion of gamey melting meat served with a smooth puree and a rich jus. The meat was obviously on the go before I was this morning, and has been caramelised around the edges with the Josper. It's sweet and meltingly tender. I feel thoroughly sated. \u00a0The chocolate fondant was acceptable, good even, but almost too much after the previous courses. It wasn't too memorable, but I did spy a Rhum Baba on an adjacent table with my name on it for next time.",

Full of suits at the bar; girl Sloanies bashing the American sizing of women's clothing; and lots and lots of couples on dates... young and old, first dates, third dates, and just-because dates. And to be fair, this place is as much a great date spot as it is a loud brasserie for hammering out all things business.At lunchtime this place is suit-central, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the romantic set out on a midweek night enjoying some very good French fare. I ordered a dirty martini while I waited for my date. It ended up not being dirty, but it did have three yummy olives to nosh, while I people watched. Dinner had its ups and downs. I had the sardines, that we nicely grilled. The charred skin spritzed with lemon juice was excellent. I wish they had boned the fish, though. Would have made it much easier to eat. On the other hand was the foie terrine. It was pretty much inedible. It was almost as though it had gone to the dark side. It was tangy in a very nasty way.The mains, however, we both superb. The Tuesday plat du jour is a beautifully rich cassoulet. Perfect for the brasserie environment. I had the ox cheeks slow-roasted in Burgundy. Yeah, definitely as amazing as it sounds. I also ordered a side of the pomme puree. It wasn't Joel Robuchon's, but it wasn't bad.Such an authentic environment with excellent traditional brasserie dishes. Will come again and again.",

    "text": "For photos, please go to chopstix2steaknives.blog\u2026  Les Deux Salon opened its doors last year. A sibling to Arbutus and Wild Honey, I was looking forward to it after a glowing review which placed dreamy notions in my head of a dessert known as Floating Island. With a friend's turn of the decade birthday coming up and a celebration venue was in order, we decided to head to Les Deux Salon. The decor exudes a muted charmed elegance and while waiting for the rest of the party to arrive, it gave me time to soak in the ambience. After placing our orders, I could see the place getting busier as the minutes passed. I don't remember much about the dishes that was ordered as it was a birthday celebration. Forgive me as I was distracted, so I could only show the photos. I do however remember my dessert though. What did i get for dessert? The Floating Island of course. It arrived and was just the most exquisite and pretty looking dessert. A meringue that was so light that it was floating and bobbing slightly in the pool of vanilla custard. The meringue just vanishes and melts in your mouth leaving a slight trace of sweetness from the cream. The cream itself was light and not overly sweet. I am in love with this. Throughout the whole dinner, service was quite absent. I could see our waiter but he hardly looked over to our table to check on us. Is it because they were busy or we had a corner table? But how do you explain when our water was only refilled twice and it was sitting empty for at least 15-20 minutes many a time and frantic waving of the arms was not successful either. In addition, I could see him topping up a glass that was still half full two tables away. I managed to catch the attention of someone else who was setting up an empty table and after notifying her of our request, she nodded and proceeded to continue to set the table. Another ten minutes later and it was clearly forgotten again. What IS going on here?! Enough ranting. As we were there to celebrate a birthday, we made a request earlier to have the slice of cake taken out at the end and presented to the birthday girl. It arrived and we sang and then we stared. We could only stare as no cutlery was given for her to eat the cake. If I wasn't cheesed off by the service, I would have laughed. Am at a loss for words. Les Deux Salon, you make good food but the service is sorely lacking.",

    "text": "I've been itching to try this restaurant since it opened last year. Luckily the three course set lunch for \u00a315.50 was the perfect excuse for a long lazy Friday meal with a friend. As I write I am completely utterly stuffed as I had also supplemented the set menu with chips and some very good wine - I can't move! The best thing about this place is the staff - my waitress was brilliant, very humorous and unpretentious. She was happy to decode some confusing French on the menu. \u00a0Velout\u00e9 is a creamy soup just in case you wanted to know. I also liked the atmosphere and look of this place - there's an upstairs and downstairs salon (two of them, hence the name), and it buzzed with happy lunch diners. The food was reasonably good - my starter was a garlic and potato soup.. I mean veloute. They served this with aplomb, with two waiters making a show pouring it into our bowls from two carafes. This was then followed by mullet with chick peas and finally a vanilla panacotta dessert. The starter and dessert were very good and tasty. I am sure my colleague back in the office will appreciate the garlic very much. However I found the mullet main too salty for my liking and overall felt slightly unimpressed by it. I am not sure how fair my appraisal is as I did alter the dish, there's was also meant to be chorizo on it but I asked to remove it (which they followed no quibbles). This place has a bistro vibe but with posh restaurant prices making it too prohibitive for it to become a regular haunt of mine. A la carte mains range from \u00a39 for a salad (not too bad), \u00a312 for a burger (ok) to \u00a322 fish (yikes!) making the set meal very good value. I would come back to try the non set but as I wasn't amazed by my main so I am in no real rush. However I would recommend this place for a pleasant lunch venue with enjoyable food in a lovely atmosphere.",

The downstairs is an all day brasserie, upstairs an evening restaurant with a good value pre-theatre menu (\u00a315.75 for two courses, or a three course option is available). We had the latter, and chose asparagus and blue cheese soup, and then confit duck cassoulet. Tasty enough if unexceptional. Previously have enjoyed their most authentic andouillette. With a carafe of picpoul white wine, our bill for two was \u00a353 inc 12.5% \"optional' service. The place was buzzy on a Thurs evening. Service was a bit slow considering it was a pre-theatre menu, and we had to abandon our plan to have dessert, as we really were going to the theatre!",

The starter was nicely presented. \u00a0I then had my main of cod and puree pommes. \u00a0The cod was cooked nicely. \u00a0Soft and flakey and smooth puree potato. I enjoyed this dish. \u00a0My friend had the lamb which was lovely and tender however, the potatoes were not and so undercooked that couldn't be eaten. \u00a0This was the only let down on the meal.As always, I had to have dessert. \u00a0They had a great selection of desserts which was a challenge to decide. \u00a0However, I think I opted for the right one and ordered Paris Brest -Choux pastry with praline cream. \u00a0This was yummy, yummy, yummy and would definitely eat it again! \u00a0One of those desserts where you want to savour it and eat it slowly however, you don't because you want to keep on putting more and more in your mouth. \u00a0Yummy! \u00a0It certainly finished the meal off nicely.Serving staff were pleasant enough. \u00a0Given we overstayed our 1.5 hours, we were not moved on or made to feel like we had overstayed our welcome.Not sure what is going on with the stairs to the toilets as we notice at least 2 people stumble on them with on lady left on her knees in front of our table! \u00a0They might need to check something there!All in all an OK evening but need to be prepared to pay a little more on the drink front.The restaurant is far enough away from the busy Covent Garden and Leicester \u00a0Square but close enough to feel part of it. \u00a0It is close to Embankment and Charing Cross station so easy access home after a night out.",

A traditional French bistro in the West End was like a little piece of Paris in Central London. The usual french menu favourites were on the menu and one could tuck into a good Duck Confit. But my recent visit, I confidently recommended going with a friend of mine thinking we would enjoy a hearty lunch. Instead the new menu was like that of a tourist steak house. Gone were the traditional favourites and in its place were hot dogs and hamburgers? What??? While it did have some French menu items they were overshadowed by the prominently featured steak list which had USDA meat and not a Steak Frite listing in sight. I ended up ordering the liver which was too salty and just overall not up to par. It was all such a let down we couldn't be bothered with dessert. The service seemed dazed and confused. It took two people to figure out I had a reservation, and when seated the hostess seemed unsure with the process of welcoming me and settling me into the table. Then it took a while before anyone approached the table to ask for drink orders. While not terrible, overall the dining was a very unsatisfying experience. What a shame as I liked it in the past. But next time I crave a bit of Paris, I might try Balthazar just down the road in Covent Garden.",

    "text": "Pre-theatre dinner treat. Busy French restaurant in the heart of Convent Garden. Classically styled. Service was pretty good - although our starters could have arrived sooner. I had fresh rock oysters to start which were great, served with a Mignonette sauce and my other half had a very delightful cauliflower soup. The baguettes fresh and delicious. I opted for the bavette frites for my main which was expertly cooked. My dinner partner had a small serving gnocchi which was also very good. Accompanied by some wine conveniently available by the carafe. Pricing was reasonable although I thought the wine was a little expensive for what it was (but where isn't in central London?). Service could have been a little quicker but we're only quibbling due to the show. Overall, I would come back and save time to try the deserts.",

    "text": "Really cool French restaurant near Trafalgar Square. So many of these fancier London restaurants now have Lunch Specials or \"Meal Deals\" where you get a three course meal for around 15 pounds ($23)...very similar to our Restaurant Week in NY, but this is just all the time. Fine dining for everyone!I loved the space...it really does evoke a beautiful French brasserie, with lots of ornate detailing along two floors. And the food is outstanding. I had a soup appetizer, a fish meal, and the cheese plate for dessert. Wonderful!",

Recently our dessert was delayed slightly, and the manager brought us a special platter of petit fours and apologised profusely. We hadn't been bothered by the delay, but it was a lovely gesture. The barmen are great. One of our favourite places in London.",

    "text": "A classy place to take a girl if you want to impress her, recommendable for a fancy night out. The venue was quite pretty and romantic without being one of those ridiculously dim-lit restaurants where you have to try to read the menu with your cell phone light. Large mirrors lining the walls and Parisian style lamps to accompany the French name. The food was hit or miss. The sea bass was delicious.. perfectly cooked and the savoy cabbages were juiced in bacon. The roast saddle of rabbit was funky and unappetizing.. two round blobs of inedible meat/fat. Luckily, the service was truly excellent, so we sent the rabbit back and asked for another order of sea bass. The waiter was completely accommodating and the new dish came within minutes.The damage at the end was pricey, especially considering the relatively tiny portion sizes. It was a birthday dinner so one of those \"don't pay attention to prices\" meal and luckily my boyfriend spoils me; otherwise I would've had to look into selling a pair of sevens or a chunk of my hair or something.",

    "text": "Another top notch place to dine in London - definitely worth a visit should you find the opportunity. \u00a0In fact, don't wait for the opportunity to arise, this is something you should go out of your way to experience. \u00a0Les Deux Salons is a French brasserie in Covent Garden, owned by the same people as Arbutus and Wild Honey, two Michelin starred restaurants also in the capital. \u00a0Les Deux Salons only opened recently but have been doing extremely well, and my experience there revealed why.It's another one of those places that take your hat and coat from you as you enter - a perfectly nice touch - makes you feel a bit special (in my modest opinion anyway!) \u00a0Crossing the threshold, it struck me are how lovely the layout was, which I think inspired the restaurant's name: there are two levels, upstairs and downstairs, but they are not completely separate like in most restaurants as the square-shaped 'hole' (for want of a better word) in the ceiling connects the two storeys together, and I think it made for quite an elegant and stylish touch. \u00a0Aside from that it does indeed look like a traditional Parisian brasserie, right down to the waiting staff who look very smart in their red ties and white shirts.As soon as you sit down, a basket of bread is brought over with butter, and what is better is that the bread is still WARM, oh so tasty. \u00a0And even better still - if you're a hungry munchkin life myself who eats all the bread within the first 5 minutes, they replace it for you! The waiting staff were very polite and accommodating. \u00a0As our starter arrived we asked if we could move tables and they made no fuss in the slightest and helped us over.The A La Carte menu here is very exciting, there were some very \u00a0adventurous offerings that I felt I just had to try, however there were some more conventional options for the not-so-bold. \u00a0We decided to begin by sharing \"warmed smoked eel, beetroot tart with horseradish cream\" and \"Herefordshire snail & bacon pie\" which confused me a bit if I'm honest - pretty certain that snail & bacon pie isn't a Herefordshire speciality, maybe I'm wrong. Or maybe, just maybe, snails from Herefordshire taste better. \u00a0Or maybe I'm just being an idiot.I'd never eaten snails or eel before, and I was impressed with the both of them. \u00a0I can't honestly say I 'enjoyed' the snails (couldn't get the image of slime out of my head) but I would definitely try them again, especially in a pie with bacon, because that really was a nice touch. \u00a0To follow I had 'Seabass, Savoy cabbage, smoked ventr\u00eache with rosemary scented sauce' which was DELICIOUS. \u00a0It can be really difficult to cook seabass properly but this was done perfectly. \u00a0My father opted for 'slow cooked ox cheeks, salsify, watercress & bone marrow salsa' which actually tasted so much better than I expected it to. \u00a0I never knew oxen would have such scrumptious cheeks...We were far too stuffed to even contemplate the dessert menu, but I did have a very nice coffee, if that counts?It really is a first rate restaurant. \u00a0The only thing holding me back from 5* is the slightly limited selection on the menu. \u00a0There was a mixture of the unusual and the not-so-unusual, but I would have liked a little more variety. \u00a0Perhaps a couple of dishes that weren't so fussy? \u00a0But maybe that's just me being picky.",

The food was really lovely and I enjoyed it. To start we shared Saucisson, which has so many amazing meats; most notably the Pate which was like butter in your mouth. I had the entrec\u00f4te b\u00e9arnaise, which was good, but the meat was a little fattier than I would have preferred for \u00a324. Also, the waitress mixed up my steak with my husband's, which was a little annoying since she played musical plates between the three of our plates and still got the temperature wrong. Either way it was resolved. For dessert we shared the apple tart Tatin with some vanilla ice cream. The crust was nice and crispy and it was so warm and gooey inside with a hint of bitterness. So good! Authentic French restaurant with great ambiance and ok service!",
