We ordered tap water which was never brought to us. We then ordered dinner and reminded the server about our water. It took him 5 more minutes. The food was horrible. I ordered the crab linguini... It was so incredibly bland. I have never disliked a meal so much. It was just bad. Don't go here.",

    "text": "A fairly omnipresent chain around London, Zizzi nevertheless offers up some good options. A tasty Italian breadboard with soft, dense olive-studded ciabatta slices, a trio of olive oil/chile-spiked oil/balsamic vinegar at your table for individual mixing, and interesting pizza and vegetable dishes make for a safe lunch stop. We tried the Primavera pizza rustica (think oblong, thinner crust): definitely decent, although I liked even more the side of grilled asparagus covered in Grana Padano shavings. The Insalata Rucola was excellent: nice vibrantly fresh rocket, with just a hint of dressing. Although I love finding smaller independent restaurants, sometimes when visiting an unfamiliar city it's good to know which chains are reliable (and, for me, have plenty of salads and fresher foods, as well as various free-range meats on the menu). Plus, offer wines in various glass sizes....",

It's not my favourite. I have to admit, I tend to feel a bit disappointed if I know I'm eating at Zizzi's that night. This particular branch is always quite bustling and full, which makes for a nice atmosphere. I came here this past Tuesday with a girlfriend, and we actually had to queue for about 10 minutes for a table, around 8pm. I had a really delicious chicken dish, served on top of bread, with a small salad on the side. My friend had a pizza that looked good (but again not great). We split some house white wine that was okay. All in all made for an okay night. Also our waiter was super friendly!",

The food was fine, but prices seemed a little steep for what you get: my pasta tasted nice but nearly \u00a310 for a main course at a chain is pushing it, I feel. Also bread comes in at \u00a33 for a fancy basket (proper Italian restaurants provide this for free). As dmj1962 says, the management of their disabled loo really misses the point: they shouldn't stack all sorts of things in the way, as it's not just wheel-chair users who use disabled loos: people with less obvious needs may wish to do so, and don't need to navigate past stored furniture. And no loo paper really is unforgiveable. So, overall three stars.",

I wasn't sure where to eat upon arrival, so I just strolled down the street to explore and see what's poppin'. I noticed that Zizzi was packed with people and everyone looked very happy, lively, and excited in the restaurant! Very good vibe! I walked in, and I was immediately greeted and seated! It's the BEST feeling to travel to a foreign city by yourself and be treated well! By then, I was starving! When you're hungry, you think you have the stomach for an elephant, but in reality, you can't eat much more than usual. I looked around to see what others ordered and the lady next to me got this seafood skewer with potatoes! The dish was nicely presented and colorfully garnished, so I asked for the name of the order and ordered the same dish. Unfortunately, they didn't have anymore seafood, so I got chicken instead. Whoa!! THAT CHICKEN WAS DELICIOUS and TOTALLY UNEXPECTED! (Well, I'm from the USA, and we usually eat frozen chicken, which is tasteless.) Along with my dish, I had a sweet and fruity strawberry cocktail! Everything went perfectly well. The service, ambiance, food! Loved it!FYI, Zizzi is a very popular chain in London, and sometimes I feel that franchises and chain restaurants are average....but this is ABOVE AVERAGE!!!",

It missed the vanilla which made it a bit dull.The people were lovely, and the wine was fantastic. I recommend this place if you go to London. Great service and great food.",

Dined here tonight and on 6/24, both times food was very good. \u00a0Husband loves the margherita pizza but has found it inconsistent depending on who's behind the oven. I've gotten the skinny pollo roquito(?) twice, which I thoroughly enjoyed and would call it my go to entree. Ordered some puffy bread for appetizers which came with 2 sauces- yumo! \u00a0Will try some of their other appetizers next time. Desserts are ok. Tried coming here 2 other times when it was busy and was ignored so left.",

The ham was too salty and chicken was tasteless. I then ordered a scoop of chocolate ice cream which never came but which was on my bill. The waiter didn't even ask if I still wanted desert or not. I will not come back.",

    "text": "This is a branch of the expanding pizza and pasta chain owned by the same group that owns ASK and Pizza Express. The restaurant is basically one large room - it's rather larger than it looks from the outside. The space is filled with tables, so it was fine when I visited for lunch, but I can imagine that it might get a bit noisy when more crowded. The d\u00e9cor is restrained with a wooden floor, pale brown walls, and curved alcoves filled with sawn-off logs as a design feature. (Well, at least the pizza ovens won't go short). Both pizza and pasta were fine - tasty, with reasonably portions, but not outstanding. Starters are around a fiver and mains from \u00a36.50 for a basic pizza up to around \u00a310 for slightly fancier dishes - most around \u00a38-\u00a39. There is a small range of both risottos and main-course salads if you don't want pizza or pasta. My only quibble with what's on offer is that the wine list - starting at \u00a314.95 a bottle - is a little pricey for a fairly standard-feeling chain. The service was OK, but seemed a little slow for somewhere that was rather less than half full. So, not outstanding, but perfectly decent. Readers may wish to see the following article in the Independent newspaper about their staff wages policy: independent.co.uk/news/u\u2026  Make up your own mind... *********************** Update: we went there again last night as we had a 2 for 1 offer, and my other half had never been, so we thought we'd give it another try. The food was OK - perfectly good, though a spicy prawn and pasta dish was rather better than my pizza, the base of which was a bit chewy and hard to cut. Great soup to start, though: mushroom with roast fennel. The service was very friendly and attentive, too - despite being choc full. Two quibbles: on a very cold night, chilly air blasted half a dozen tables in every time someone opened the front door. They need a screen or something (the 'air screen' was totally ineffective). More importantly, their disabled loo had furniture stacked outside and other items stored inside, and there was no toilet paper. The waitress said if a wheelchair user came in they would move all the stuff, and that senior management had sanctioned its use in this way. I don't think this is really on: the whole point of disabled facilities is to make it easier for disabled people, not make them feel a nuisance for wanting to use the store-room. They need separate storage. NB: despite having a disabled toilet, there is a 5-6 inch step at the front door: OK for manual wheelchairs with some help, but no good for electric wheelchairs.",

We ordered two main dishes -a large pizza with goat cheese & vege- & the other was spaghetti with meat balls, which i think they are very basic italian dishes, & when we tasted them, their flavour is really below standards & very disappointing. They were horribly tasteless. The only good thing they have is their starting appetizers, the bread & the Calemari were very good. & of course their big comforting space & decorations.",
