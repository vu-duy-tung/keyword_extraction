Once you drink a Pacifico with lime you will never want a Corona again. \u00a0Unfortunately, I went over the weekend and was informed they would not be carrying Pacifico beer until further notice. wtf. Overall, for the price and the \"mexican\" food you get, I would skip this place unless you want tex-mex with tons of cheese on it.",

I used to work across the street from Cafe Pacifico when I was living in London and it would be a special treat to get to eat at Cafe Pacifico. (I was really poor at the time!) I usually ordered the brisket Quesada Grande with everything on it. It came with an orange slice that made the brisket really juicy when squeezed over the top. I can totally vouch for the authenticity of the Tex-Mex. But, let me tell you people...in Texas you will get as many baskets of chips and salsa as your heart desires because we a re bunch of fat asses so they are really doing you a favor by only given you one complimentary basket!",

I sat at the bar, chatted with friendly bar staff, tried some fancy tequilas, ate pretty tasty bar snacks (better than the table service, I'd say), destroyed some quacamole and drank delicious delicious spicy beer until I couldn't feel my tongue anymore.I can't think of any other bar that I'd rather while away a Saturday afternoon at in Covent Garden. Quiet, secluded and relaxed. Win.My previous review still stands, I don't think I'd eat here again. But for hanging out, drinking mexican gold and avoiding the intense London crowds and environment, this place is a Mexi-CAN.As opposed to a Mexi-CAN'T, which is something Mexican which CAN'T do something Mexican based. It finds itself unable to fulfil that particular Mexican criteria. Mexi-unable just don't cut it at this level.Well, maybe it isn't that it can't do it, just that it isn't very good at it. I suppose you could call it MEH-xican, if you like word play and stuff.",

To your right is the grand bar - always packed with stools situated around the bar and people standing everywhere. In front of you and to your right are table and chairs with red and white tablecloths. This is the restaurant area where sizzling fajitas and burritos are continuously being served.As a group the restaurant is great - sharing food and trying out new dishes. The tables are positioned in a very social setting hence the loud, bubbly atmosphere.My favourite part of this place is the bar. Somewhere to go as just two. You can sit at the bar all night! Ordering corn chips, guacamole, salsa and tasty cocktails. The bar staff are incredible - creating the most amazing cocktail creations ever! The walls are lined with all the different cocktails they produce and a very detailed and thorough selection of spirits. A fun buzzing place open from 12noon to 11:45pm - a must!",

    "text": "Quick summary: the best Mexican food I've had in London so far. As those of you who follow me know, since moving been to London I've been in a never ending search for good Mexican food. As the U2 classic goes, I still haven't found what I'm looking for. But Cafe Pacifico is damn close. We couldn't get into the (mediocre) Wahaca so went off in search of alternative Mexican delights. We had heard rumblings of Cafe Pacifico and a quick check of the Qype iPhone app yielded the address and some good reviews. We found it nestled in a relatively quiet street in Covent Garden. As soon as we walked into the place I had high hopes. It FELT like a Mexican restaurant. Like a cheesy, tacky Californian Mexican restaurant that you'd find in Ensenada or something. I have to admit, I got a little emotional. As far as I'm concerned, restaurants live or die by there ambiance/atmosphere and Cafe Pacifico had nailed it. The place was buzzing with energy, the staff were smiling and having a good time, the walls were covered in nick-nacks and chotchkes that made the place feel like a real Californian Mexican restaurant. And we hadn't even ordered. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table but that wasn't a problem for two reasons 1) it gave us a chance to check out the bar and 2) it was 50 minutes less than the wait at Wahaca. The barkeep handed us a menu and I was immediately impressed with the Mexican beer selection. The Mexicans do great beer. Negro Modelo, Sol, Mexicali, etc are all fantastic and Cafe Pacifico had at least 8 different Mexican beers. We quickly got our table and the menu had some impressive treasures. Burritos, Chimichangas, etc were all there. My one piece of advice to Cafe Pacifico would be to ditch the haute cuisine stuff (duck, soy, etc) - you don't need the foodies, concentrate on your already good Mexican food and you'll be in great shape. LOVE the fact that they have Eastern Mexican food on the menu as well. My barometer for any Mexican restaurant is two fold: burritos and refried beans. Cafe Pacifico delivered both with aplomb. Way to go guys, you've now officially been awarded the alexhunter Best Mexican Food in London award.",

The place was hopping. It is a big restaurant up a flight of stairs from the street and it was about three quarters full with what seemed primarily to be office workers out for an afternoon lark. They were swilling chips and salsa and beer and having a great time. The chips, salsa and food were all in the better-than-good range; it was especially good for a chain \u00a0because that is what Pacifico is, a chain with stores also in Sydney, Amsterdam and (at the time) Paris.

The hype sells it as a mexican restaurant in the heart of covent graden - the kind of place you can go with lots of friends and have a really social experience with lots of cocktails and authentic mexican food. When I went I found that the service is chronically slow (don't go if you want to get food before 9pm), the drinks overpriced and sticky cocktails, and the food deep fried, deep fried and oh deep fried. What I hated even more was the open kitchen and the way it seemed to spew so much smoke into the restuarant that it was impossible to see to the other side of the table. Thank god I wasn't going out afterwards because my hair stank of cooking meat. I like the idea of these restaurants which provide a great atmosphere as well as good food, I just feel like in Cafe Pacifico I could do with a little less atmospere and some better food. I'm willing to give it another go but if I come out smelling of smoke again then that's it!...",

We were taught how to properly 'taste' tequila as a liqueur by sampling Cafe Pacifico's own brand (apparently it's best to breathe through your mouth when smelling it so that you don't get too strong a hint).

I went with a friend and shared a plate of nachos, REALL nachos! Not as big and plentiful as Red Robbin's Macho Nachos, but then again I'm in the States for good reason. We each had a margarita but sadly they left a lot to be desired. I've had beer and other drinks since and they are pretty good.Regardless, the staff were friendly, the environment was great, not too pretending to be Mexican but mostly actual Mexican. I've brought other State dwellers here as finding decent, true Mexican food is difficult to do in London. It's not going to be the same as home, but it is able to provide a very nice substitute. I also believe they are one of the few places that serves El Pacifico beer, and as the BF has lived in Cali he couldn't believe his luck in me knowing of a place that housed one of his favourite beers from the States. So to American's, keep an open mind to this place unless you're only passing through. If you've been here for some time this place is great, and for everyone else, it's worth trying after some viewing of street performers or shopping around Covent Garden. It's far enough off the beaten path that most tourist won't be able to spot it. Total win for me.",

The end result was a high quality mojito on the house while I waited another 10 minutes for them to cook it again.The bar is fully stocked and I believe it has over 100 types of tequila. I'm not a tequila man, but their mojitos are pretty good, especially if you splash out for the better quality rum.Whenever my craving for good Mexican food gets bad enough, I sometimes find myself considering the 45 min flight to London for quick trip, dropping by Caf\u00e9 Pacifico along the way.

Served in FLOUR tortillas (?!) and wrapped as little mini-burritos they were, contradictorily, exceedingly mundane.Points for atmosphere, location, salsa, service, and the pleasant company with whom I dined, but I don't really have much more to give props for. Sorry, homes.",

    "text": "yup this was a great place. Id organised to meet old uni pals here. No reservations taken here which was handy as we werent sure how many of us would show up.the restaurants was larger than i thought, and the bar area was ample. I got there early so had time to hang out at the bar.Our allotted time at the table was 2 hours but we ran over that time by a great deal. it was so cosy in there we could move a good vibe as the atmosphere from the bar just spread across the whole restaurant.food was fresh and flavoursome i had the veggi tosda and there were plenty of veg options.the decor felt really genuine not kitsch as one might expect in a chain (very small chain) definately had the feel of an independent, successful Mexican tavern one like your local friends would take you to. i would definitely re-organise an impromptu get together here any day!",

They serve very very tasty food, it may be a European interpretation of Mexican food.You'll find quesadillas (pronounced kay-ser-diller) and fajitas all filling and spicy and warm. You'll also get friendly staff and great value lunch deals. So as you can see, if you don't go in there expecting the food to be fresh out of Mexico you won't be disappointed. This place could have been a solid 3 star place but I'm craving black beans right now so was generous!",

    "text": "Cafe Pacifico has been around for 30 years or so, which along with its sister La Perla restaurants a stone's throw away in Maiden Lane and Charlotte Street, are the original London Mexican cantinas. And they are the first bars in England to be honoured with the 'Distinctivo T' award by the Tequila Regulatory Council of Mexico for thie exceptionally high standards in the service and promotion of Tequila. This cafe-bar brand is managed but the charming and knowledgeable Carlos Londono (actually!) who taught me that Tequila is made from a blue Cactus-like agave plant grown in a limited area of Mexico with AOC-DOC type regulation - you may know that, but I bet you didn't know that Mezcal is another broader term for this spirit category and made from similar plants though with a range of different colours! It's the difference between Cognac and Brandy if you forgive my second French alcohol comparison in a Mexican place review!The busy yet relaxed party atmosphere here would be great for tables of any party size or even for one, two (or many like us) to prop up the bar. Colourful wall posters and food dishes abound - both of which include good quality versions of the standard fare you'd expect in a Mexican here such as guacamole, as well as less 'Tex-Mex' outcomes like the interestingly-tasting and nicely spiced tender beef or mango empanadillas that come with sour cream dips, or the pork belly slices with red cabbage in authentic imported tortillas. I will go back here again and again. They did it right, if I might borrow the phrase from the post-Olympic verdict of London 2012. Well I had to get it in somewhere (who's not still excited?)",

So I'm extremely hard to please when it comes to Mexican cuisine...I only ordered four beef taquitos, which tasted pretty good but not exactly the size i expected them to be. Usually they are a bit longer than the size of egg rolls (spring rolls), so I ordered four of them. When they arrived, i couldn't believe my eyes...they were quite humongous and I could only consume two of them. If I wold have known these were GIGANTIC taquitos, I would have only ordered two. I'll have to ask the waiter about portion size next time....but I'd def go back again :)",

I have been working in London for the past 24 years, and yet somehow, Cafe Pacifico jjust a few steps away from Covent Garden station had passed me by. I don't tend to hang around Covent Garden much any more due to its touristy nature, but Cafe Pacifico is tucked down a little side street.As you walk in, it is like walking into a little bar in Mexico \u00a0you suddenly feel like you must be more fun and vibrant because everything around you is!We couldn't have been made more welcome than we were by the lovely Carlos \u00a0manager and part-owner.We were given glasses of iced water, gorgeous samples of food (best guacamole I have had in years and the beef and jalepeno quesadillas were to die for), and of course tequila.We were given a huge jug of beautifully fresh, zingy margueritta and then treated to a very passionate talk about tequila and Cafe Pacifico's history.Carlos then taught just how to drink tequila (another skill to put on my CV) and it is the first time I have been able to enjoy it \u00a0not a salt shaker or lemon/lime piece in sight!The rest of our group ended up having to come and hunt us down as Carlos brought out more jugs of margueritta, showed us photos of the agave plantations (the plant tequila is made from) and generally made us feel like his special guests.A great place to spend a lively evening with friends :)",

    "text": "We went here because of the Yelp reviews. It was AWFUL food! Not Mexican in the least. When I pointed out to the manageress that they don't drench seafood in sweet mustard sauce in Mexico, that in fact they don't even HAVE mustard in Mexico, she claimed the food was meant to be \"Mexican fusion.\" More like CON-fusion, said my date...That's not what it claims on the menu, which states clearly that the food is \"authentic Mexican.\" It's not. It's tired, boring and tasteless. The tortilla chips were poured out of a bag (and most of ours were crushed remnants too small to pick up any of the salsa) The salsa was made in a blender, liquidized like gazpacho more than proper fresh salsa cruda. The beans were right out of a can with no \"refrying\" as proper refritos should have had, and mine were dry and crusty around the edges from being under heat lamps too long before serving. The vegetarian fajitas were mostly square-cut carrots poured right out of a bag, barely heated through. Should have been called \"warm salad\" instead of fajitas. I sent it back to be cooked and pointed out it was missing the asparagus the menu promised and it came back ten minutes later only slightly warmer, with some asparagus bits hardly larger than a toothpick scattered in, and those were totally raw. It had no flavour and was not worth eating so I sent it back. Almost when the meal was over I asked the waiter what had happened to the guacamole and cheese and jalapenos that were supposed to have come with my order and he went and got them. 10 MORE minutes later. DO NOT BOTHER TO EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT IT IS AWFUL and about as far from real Mexican food as it's possible to be. We went because it was our 27-year anniversary and we spent our honeymoon in Mexico. I grew up in California and I am a Mexican cook myself, so I do know what the real thing should taste like. This is not the real thing. Run away. Run far away!",

    "text": "One of my friends once told me that you don't eat Mexican food in London. \u00a0We've been here twice now, and honestly I love it. \u00a0I also love to read reviews before I write my own to get an idea of what people think, and I think I've determined that people's ideas of what Mexican food should be like at restaurants are completely different.Growing up in Alaska, my experience with good Mexican food was pretty standard. \u00a0Nothing special, but I always enjoyed the flavor profiles. \u00a0After moving to New Mexico and experiencing the wonders of the cuisine there, I fell in love with the flavors even more. \u00a0Then I moved to California, where honestly, I felt like most of the places were pretty much the standard, bland, tasteless food you get everywhere. \u00a0Maybe I've never been to the \"good\" Californian restaurants, but my six-year experience of the food there basically seemed to be different fatty cuts of meat dripping in grease thrown into tortillas. \u00a0Throw some boring beans and rice on the side and you've got a Mexican dinner. \u00a0Granted there were one or two places that really elevated things, like the Oaxacan place I would go to in Watsonville that closed down, but the \"standard\" places were pretty boring.It's why it puzzles me that many reviews talk about how this isn't the amazing food in California. \u00a0Honestly, it's better than a lot of the places I went to there. \u00a0Yes, there are a few faults, what place doesn't have those? \u00a0But I've eaten here twice now, and both times I was more than pleasantly surprised with the food.The first time I went, it was with a large group. \u00a0I had the steak and mushroom fajitas, and they were really tasty. \u00a0I thought the flavors were much better than I could have dreamed and much better than the Mexican place that's near our flat.The second time we went, it was just my partner and I. \u00a0He wanted to order the duck and scallop fajitas again because they were insanely tasty the first time, but he decided he should try something else. \u00a0We decided to share some quesadillas, so I ordered the chicken and he ordered the mango, jalapeno, and Brie. \u00a0Both were quite tasty, the chicken being slightly more traditional, and the Brie being a bit more of a modern take. \u00a0He had the beef chimichanga main, and I had the street tacos (which are five mini tacos: \u00a0steak, chicken, pork, shrimp, and chorizo) with a side of the mole sauce. \u00a0I love mole, and was a bit apprehensive, but I figured I should try it. \u00a0I want to swim in their mole. \u00a0It was more chocolately and sweet than most moles I've had, but it had a background heat that made the sauce amazing. \u00a0I gave some to my partner, and he fell in love with it too. \u00a0Mine also came with charro beans (a bowl of beans with pork) and I'm going to see if I can order those instead of refried beans. \u00a0Amazing. \u00a0Also, I will be ordering mole every time I go. \u00a0I don't care if it's not traditional, it's fantastic.The drinks are tasty, my personal favorite are the rose margaritas (which are pomegranite and rosemary, seem weird, but tasty). \u00a0Nothing is perfect, we had slightly stale chips on one of the meals, but the salsa is fairly tasty.Yes, there are some strange things which aren't \"authentic\", like the duck and scallop fajitas and the Brie quesadillas, but I think they do a great job bringing a modern twist to some great classics. \u00a0Plus, I've never been to Mexico. \u00a0My ideas (and several others who reviewed this place) seem to be based on eating Mexican food in the United States. \u00a0The Oaxacan restaurant in California had some unusual dishes I'd never seen before in Mexican restaurants. \u00a0I'm pretty sure that like the US, Mexico puts a regional flair on their cuisines, and while they don't seem authentic to me, they might be authentic to others. \u00a0All in all, it's a fun place, where you can have a good time and some enjoyable food. \u00a0Just be prepared for a bit of a wait for a table on the weekends!",

I particularly liked the tables by open windows, which looked very welcoming on a humid summer's day.Price-wise some items seemed a bit high - the appetisers in particular. Saying that, it is a Central London restaurant so they are keeping up with the Joneses in that sense. A bonus is that, in true Tex-Mex style, they provide free tortilla chips without you having to ask.I'm no expert on this genre of food, but I was happy with my quesadilla and the portions were decent - pretty sure I didn't finish mine and that's a rare occurrence!Downsides would be that the customer service seems to try very hard when they want to serve you, but it can take an age to grab someone's eye. The presentation on the plates could also do with a bit of work - I find that with this type of food, it can look like a pile of slop unless handled delicately.",

    "text": "This review is for the benefit of Americans, Mexicans, and anybody else who has experienced authentic Mexican food. Anybody who has sampled steak and kidney pie understands that Londoners do not have high standards for cuisine, so this review isn't aimed at locals.First, the good:A nice selection of tequilas, and they got my Margarita right. If I were just there to have some Margaritas or do some shots, I'd rate it at 5/5 and the review would be over.The decor and atmosphere are nice. Squint your eyes a bit and ignore the goofy-looking people, and you might be in California.Now the bad:I had the \"street tacos\" plate. One of them came with lamb. I asked the server to make mine just steak and pork, but I got them as per the menu, with lamb. I don't like lamb. The tacos came with a large bowl of refried beans, which quickly went off to the side.So I get it: they do the best with the ingredients they source locally. The tacos have lamb. The seafood enchilada is made from cod. Fine.The chips were over-salty (the standard \"sell more Margaritas\" trick) and the salsa is clearly from a jar. It tasted like Pace.If this restaurant were to listen to my advice for making this place more palatable to people familiar with Mexican food, I would suggest:- more carnitas options, please.- very few people like a big bowl of refried beans with their tacos.- it's not actually that hard to make fresh salsa, and it makes a huge difference. Just have somebody come in a bit early and chop some tomatoes and onions, and throw in a little cilantro, garlic powder, chipotle, or fresh chiles. Really, that canned stuff is nasty.- if you are going to festoon your tacos with raw onions, please cut them into smaller pieces. Believe me, I won't be kissing any British citizens while I'm here, but still.In summary: I might return if I'm in the mood for some Margaritas and light bites, but for authentic Mexican, I'll pass.I've enjoyed reading other reviews of this place here on Yelp that state, to the effect, \"best Mexican food in London.\" While I have no doubt that this is true, the phrase \"damning with faint praise\" comes to mind. \"best Mexican food in London\" is a bit like saying \"most talented member of Bananarama.\"",

I would give the ambiance 5 stars, really I would. \u00a0The interior is cozy, inviting and perfect for relaxing with a margarita after a long day. \u00a0I think Viviane's review describes it best. \u00a0It's been packed full both times I've been, which can make for a long wait.As far as the food goes, pretty average. \u00a0It will satisfy your cravings, but it is gringo style all the way. \u00a0That's ok, I didn't expect it to be anything else and it helps an Arizona girl get a piece of home while abroad.",

It all came out suspiciously quickly, too, so that my general impression was that it might as well have been pre-plated two days ago and microwaved to order. Especially the beans.The atmosphere was great, the servers were totally on their game.In the end though I'm really glad I split a meal with my guy and didn't pay 10+ pounds a piece for a basic mexican lunch.",

Servers are friendly and seats are plentiful.Compared to Mexican food from Mexico and Southern California, however, the food here is way overpriced and not authentic. In terms of a nice dinner out in Covent Garden, though, pricing is decent and the food is alright. I just wasn't a fan because compared to what I am used to, the food didn't taste as rich and hearty. But! What can I expect.... we are thousands of miles away from Mexico :)",

    "text": "Yeah.... no. My fajitas involved baby corn and asparagus. And one, yes one piece of broccoli. That's right folks, it was like a delicious Asian stir fry and a delicious Mexican fajita together in a totally disgusting flour tortilla marriage. Well I object. Chips were cold (read: not freshly made... or gasp, perhaps not made in house. I'm praying for the former.) And the margarita tasted medicinal... and not in that \"oh, it burns, it burns!\" tequila-type way.To end with a few hugely redeeming qualities: the salsa was actually the best, yes the BEST I've had in London. Spicy, just the right texture and very flavourful. Yum, yum, yum!Also, the atmosphere is fantastic -- exactly what a dirty Tex-Mex place should be. None of this sterile plastic-y pink, white, and neon green stuff that seems to be synonymous with \"Mexican\" here in London.Finally, the service was on it. A few missed connections here and there, but in general, I was exceptionally impressed with the speed, friendliness, and quality of every staff member I was in contact with.Overall, this was a fabulous place to hang out with a table full of my closest friends. Next time I'll just drink beer and eat the salsa by the spoonful.",

Growing up in California as a Mexican American, on Mexican food my whole life, nothing comes closer to the authenticity of the culture as Cafe Pacifico (so far!) It offers not only great food but the atmosphere as well, ranchera musica and friendly service with a smile. The only thing missing were the mariachis! And it would have been nice to see 'flan' on the dessert menu but you can't have everything :)",

It was Saturday lunchtime, and we had no problem getting a table. Ordering was quick and the food can quickly as well. However, the food was just average. On previous visits, i received a large plate with Mexican rice and delicious black beans. This time, the food arrived in a trendy rectangular plate with a square burrito with just a drizzle of soured cream. The rice and beans were contained in small bowls, which I had to tip out in order to eat them with the burrito. I think someone has been watching to much Masterchef. The rice was bland, no way was it \"Mexican\" rice, the black beans were bland and the burrito was nothing special. If you don't know what authentic Mexican food tastes like, or have never been here before - it was an average meal. But I will search for an authentic Mexican restaurant in London and not visit here again.",

I am talking here on behalf of 5 people that went with me and all agreed that MY CHOICE sucked :(I have to say though that service was polite and nice- even when we said nothing about the burnt appetizer sampler dish- the waiter came over after 20 minutes and suggested to replace 'just the onion rings' with new well-cooked ones !! we said no",

The decor is a little strange and eclectic but somehow it works together with the fun music to create an extremely pleasant atmosphere.Im with Larissa on the disappointing tacos. Not what I expected. But the fajitas are really good and from my experience the service is quite quick most days(you do get the one random day where you cant seem to get anyones attention). The food always comes in a timely manner which is really good if you're eating alone.Overall the vibe is great.

    "text": "I've never been fond of Tequila, for me it's always been that nauseating drink that's forced upon you at the beginning or the end of a night along with a dry wedge of lemon and salt. Yuck, yuck and triple yuck! However I have heard that along with Whisky and Rum, that if you avoid the horrible, cheap ones that you find littering bar shelves across the country, and find a good one, it's actually rather nice. I've tried very hard to find a good tequila bar and here at Cafe Pacifico I think I may have found it! They have a good range of Tequila, appear to be rather passionate about it. they even have a lovely certificate to prove that they have been approved by the Tequila Regulatory Council and that they are the first UK catering establishment to be awarded the distintivo T award for it's promotion of Tequila. I take this to be a good sign and can confirm that the Tequila that I sampled here, is indeed nice, in fact I might, even hasten to add, delicious!Cafe Pacifico is affiliated with La Perla, another Mexican restaurant with branches located around London. It has a very similar feel \u00a0quite rustic and down to earth, with lots of wood and chunky tiles. This restaurant, unlike others in the chain, however is not underground so it has a nice bright atmosphere and is warm and lively.The food at Cafe Pacifico and La Perla, is also very similar, expect nacho's, taco's, quesadilla's. which, although quite uninspiring, is made well, appears to be fresh, and is great Tequila drinking food!The restaurant itself was very busy (especially for my Wednesday visit), but if you go to eat rather than sit at the bar, you'll have more chance to bag yourself a seat. So grab yourself a seat and a few plates to share, and enjoy the lively buzz!Whilst not a gourmet experience, I can see this place as being a fun and friendly place, with a good vibe, perfect for meeting up with friends after work for a few drinks, or before going out on a weekend.",

But thankfully the restaurant were really sweet and held our tables for us (they were obviously hoping for the 15-cover!) We arrived and all caught up in our raised private-feeling area of the busy and bustling restaurant. I say caught up, we shouted over the music. It was a tad too loud, even for the music and drinking lover I am! We eventually sat down after standing around chatting for over half an hour (whoops).Mexican is this place's speciality and it does do it well. I had the chicken enchiladas and they were delicious. Lovely tomato sauce, refried beans, coriander salad and paprika rice. Nice flavours, but I wanted more chilli heat. I asked for it without sour cream so I could try and get some of that (plus charging \u00a31 extra for sour cream is completely ridiculous), but to no avail. Plus at \u00a311 this place isn't cheap. It's in Covent Garden so can up its prices to attract tourists, but it won't pull any favours with regular crowds when it charges \u00a317 for fajitas! I mean, THAT IS RIDICULOUS pricing for fajitas that I can cook just as well at home (I do love cooking a cheeky Mexican dish though!)Brisk service, nice food but overpriced. Tone down the music, knock off \u00a32 from your pricing and you'll get another star from me.",

Very chill vibe for a restaurant.That said - the food was just okay. I think Mexican food is easy to get right and hard to get wrong, IMO.The flavors were great - but the spices do most of the work. Service was amazing and super friendly. Our dinner entrees came out minutes after we ordered.I got street tacos and this combo plate is really good, but the soft taco shells were cold and soggy. I guess nothing was that fresh except for maybe the onion and cilantro chopped on it. Came with two sauces that I liked. I think it would have been a world of a difference if these soft tacos and food came out hot or at least warm. So overall it was good, but London must not have many good Mexican food options if this one is considered one of the best. My stomach wasn't too happy afterwards either, but that's probably just a me-specific thing. Next time I come, I might try to eat off the Modern Mexican section of the menu.",

    "text": "It's nice to see that Cafe Pacifico is still going strong after many years; and thanks to the Qype Review Crawl I was reminded just why this used to be one of my favourite hang-outs. I now don't spend that much time going out in Soho and Covent Garden anymore, and somehow the draw of something new quite often outweighs old favourites.I didn't know that Cafe Pacifico is part of a little chain of quality Mexican restaurants in London (La Perla is a sister restaurant) and Amsterdam. I also didn't know that they are the only bar in London to be accredited by some official tequila authority. But then that's not that much of a surprise as I am not a big fan of spirits and have bad memories of a hangover following a tequila party years ago Tasting tequila in a more respectful way has almost convinced me to give the stuff another chance. The margarita was delicious, and I will come back from more when there is time to finish the glass.We were treated to a selection of snacks from the bar menu. They were all delicious albeit a bit messy to eat. The jalapeno taccos were drenched in cheese and very moreish, and I even triied a piece of belly pork which was served with guacamole and a red coleslaw and eaten wrapped in a soft tortilla.I am looking forward to an excuse to come back for a full meal soon.",

Thanks to Grant T for the recommendation!We really enjoyed it - one small problemo though - \u00a0on our part - we asked for our meals HOT! Boy were they HOT! so HOT it was hard to eat...but the bits we managed (smothered in sour cream) were tasty! The place itself is pretty funky, I'd say a bit cooler to hang out in than even Wahaca's.I was in awe by how HOT they made our food, most places are afraid to turn up the heat in your meal that much! Impressive great balls of fire! Will definitely go back!",

Ein gro\u00dfes Dankesch\u00f6n an T und die Londoner Qype Crew!! Hier wurden wir von Carlos begr\u00fc\u00dft, der schon seit ungef\u00e4hr 15 Jahren im Gesch\u00e4ft dabei ist. Das Cafe Pacifico ist nich nur auf mexikanines Essen Spezialisiert, sondern schenkt auch viiiiele verschiedene Tequilla-Sorten ein. Darum ging es hier auch: Um Tequilla. Ob pur oder im Margarita-Cocktail \u00a0es schmeckte uns! Und heute geht es mir auch gar nicht so schlecht, wie sonst wenn ich einen Tequilla-Abend hinter mir habe ;) Die Qualit\u00e4t der Spirituose, die aus der blauen Agarve gewonnen wird, ist also tats\u00e4chlich eine sehr gute gewesen. Darauf pochte Carlos auch: Das dem schlechten Ruf von Tequilla endlich ein Ende gesetzt werden muss!!Das Restaurant an sich ist sehr rustikal aber gem\u00fctlich eingerichtet. Viel Holz, eine offene K\u00fcche und recht gro\u00df. An der gro\u00dfen Bar stehen zig Tequillaflaschen und das Personal ist bestens drauf.Ich werde auf jeden Fall wieder kommen!! Das Essen war grandios, die Margharita war k\u00f6stlich (frischer Limonensaft, besser gehts gar nicht!!) und die Stimmung war super.In diesem Sinne: Muchas Gracias!!!",

    "text": "A very busy and incredibly popular Mexican restaurant, located in the heart of Covent Garden. The food - fajitas, burritos, chimichangas and the like for me falls more into the 'Tex-Mex' category (ie, no chicken in chocolate-chilli sauce). There are a some beef, pork and fish dishes if you don't want Tex-Mex. There's enough vegetarian dishes to provide veggies with some choice. For starters, mains, drinks and service, expect to pay around \u00a330 a head. We went there as part of a group on Mexico's Independence Day (16 September), and it was absolutely packed (fortunately, we had booked), and the atmosphere buzzing. I was very impressed by our waiter, who was really into the spirit of things, as well as being very efficient. It was very noisy, but that was part of the package. It's not somewhere I'd want to go all the time, and I suspect it's better suited to groups than couples wanting a quiet night out. The main downside for me was that they had a special offer on pitchers of margaritas, which my colleagues ordered enthusiastically, and I discovered that it is very easy to consume too much without realising it. Thank heavens for alka-seltzer...",

Maybe it's because I'm a New Yorker, maybe it's because I'm a tequila fanatic, but I found the drinks to be incredibly weak; and the guacamole tasted like cardboard. Great attentive service and fun atmosphere though, and once you order an extra shot of tequila to add to the margaritas, they're not so bad. Wouldn't recommend to friends but probably would stop by again- avoid the guac.",

Overall the food wasn't too bad and it was a pretty good margarita but the waitress should probably not work in customer service! I decided to give this place another try as the food isn't too bad, what a mistake! Once again the customer service here stinks..we queried the bill as wine has always been offered to us instead of beer or a margarita on the lunch menu. She said this had never been the case so instead I provided her with the Yelp voucher to get 20% off the bill, she then laughed in our faces and stormed off to correct the bill.

It has some other spice that isn't used in traditional Mexican guacamole. I had the lunch special made of chicken and salsa Verde, and could barely eat the thing (it's one of my favorite dishes at an actual Mexican restaurant). Even the Coke was highly watered down by stale ice.I was very happy to see a Mexican restaurant after all of these days overseas, but unfortunately I think we should change the name of the restaurant to \"Mexican kind-of style restaurant\". What they did serve wasn't that great.Service was poor - tough to get the attention of a server and took forever to get food. Definitely won't be back.",

The servers kept refilling our tortilla chips and salsa munchies in the meantime, without making us feel like we were wasting table space which was nice, though the place wasn't full. We also ordered one of their 100% agave tequila shots as a penalty for my flatmate's lateness, which seemed to go down smoothly!The food is the missing piece of the puzzle for me though; there's a good range on the menu but I've tried a couple of things now and chicken or beef, enchilada or chimichanga, I've repeatedly found it lacking in flavour. They're also served with an accompanying deluge of refried beans and rice that sadly I found quite bland and too heavy to finish.The fun friendly vibe, central location and aforementioned drinks mean I'd agree to meet up there again if a Pacifico fan asked - but I wouldn't get your hopes up for the food.",

I honestly wasn't ever expecting to get good Mexican food this side of the pond, but it did remind me of Texas (my home town, so other yanks may disagree) in terms of tasty.We also had a couple of cocktails - their selections of mojito is fantastic! - but opted out of the tequila from the longest tequila menu I've seen this side of Mexico, because, well, it's just a Thursday dinner!Very excited to have finally found a passable London Mexican, and will DEFINITELY be back!

    "text": "I'd visited Cafe Pacifico a couple of years ago when moving to London was but a dream and remembered them doing the most amazing margaritas. I'm trying to be a little more adventurous when ordering out so rather than sticking with one of their tried and tested dishes I opted for the curado tequila creole sea scallops with crab and asparagus as I absolutely adore seafood but don't eat it enough. As this was just a starter option the waiter suggested that I also get a portion of rice on the side to bulk it out a bit which was definitely a great suggestion.Sadly I was left quite disappointed with my choice though as the sauce while nice was very thick and creamy leaving an odd tar like coating on my tongue. The first few bites were lovely but it soon became a bit sickly. Michael on the other hand thoroughly enjoyed his chile con carne and I know that they do other dishes really well so I do still recommend this place but I left after this visit feeling a bit dissatisfied unfortunately.",

We arrived a little early and were sent to the bar to chill before our table was ready. The bar area was quite busy, lots of people eating and drinking there. I assume anyone without a reservation was at the bar claiming their place to tuck into some tacos. (Tip... do make a reservation, the bar area isn't all that big).After we ordered a Mexican Punch, we were kindly collected by our waiter and taken to our table where chips and salsa was waiting for us, WINNING! Both my housemate and I had decided what we were going to order before arriving, haha, I always check the menu of every place I eat at before going, its weird, but Oh so effective.We both ordered Street Tacos- mine with chicken, gammon and chorizo, and my housemate- chicken, chorizo and steak. There is a huge buzz in the restaurant, lots of chatting, eating and drinking tequila. The food didn't take too long to arrive, and is presented in a fun way. We decided to order a Lycee Margarita to go with the dinner. The food was pretty delicious, I'm a huge fan. Though I'm not sure I ordered enough food, I was still kinda hungry afterwards, but that was more my fault for not ordering a side or something.All in All a pretty fun and delicious night, and I will be back for Taco Tuesday.",

I am also a self confessed moaner about there not being any quality Mexican in London. I fall on my sword, because I have finally found it! Thank you Cafe Pacifico!I went to Cafe Pacifico for a friends birthday and was so glad. Where to start? Tortilla chips and salsa were great, and dont forget the guacamole. The margaritas are strong and not too sweet, just the way I like them. The buckets of beer were also a reasonable price which is hard to find in London, especially Covent Garden. The portions were huge, and thank goodness for that because the chimichangas were great. It was an eat till I hurt experience, but had no regrets. Suggestion, don't wear tight jeans if you too have no self restraint. I am so glad to have finally found a place in central London where I can get my Mexican fix. Will be back very soon, for Margarita Monday and Taco Tuesday anyone? \u00a0OLE!",

They should be embarrassed to add an auto 12.5% service charge for the quality of their service. Shame on you. Clearly from my experience this will not be a repeat for me.",

But I'd rather pay double for an authentic Mexican experience. I am from California and I love/know my tacos, so I chose the California tacos. That was a mistake to think that perhaps this place will be authentic cause of the name and basing on ok reviews on Yelp. My minced beef tacos (I should have known, this ain't carne asada) tasted like Taco Bell tacos. If you are from America, you know what I'm talking about with its crunchy taco skin and minced beef, even the cheese and lettuce resemble it. The rice was awfully dry and didn't taste anything remotely close to real Mexcican food. What is it about Mexican eateries in London do not know how to make real Mexican rice? All they have to do is first fry the rice with with vegetable oil (I know it's unhealthy but that's how they cook the real thing), tomatoes, garlic and onions, then simmer them until rice fluffy. If you are a fellow Yankee Doodle living in London and miss Taco Bell, go for their beef tacos in their lunch menu. Their fajitas and everything else looks similar to Chevy's or something like that in America.",

The Chimichangas are superb, as are the Enchiladas. But no matter how good the lunchtime special is, it is the full menu that will tempt most people to return. The Taquiza, although on the pricier side, is awesome. The Street Tacos, Burritos and Alabre Tepoztlan are too. Even basics like the Chilli-con-carne are top-notch but might prove somewhat fiery to many palates. Vegetarian options are available, but limited. Best bet to non-meat-eaters will probably be the Tostada. The bill can sometimes take a while to arrive but then that's probably because the staff know that movement shouldn't really be attempted on such a full stomach!",

They also serve tex-mex incarnations, such as nacho cheese platters, which I've tried but not really enjoyed. Although their homemade salsa is very nice. As for drinks, Mexican beer is so underrated and No! Corona is NOT a Mexican beer!!! Negra Modelo seems to be the drink of choice for most of Pacifico's patrons, as it was mine, until they brought in Bohemia. I'd only had it once in San Diego a few years ago but my tastebuds have longed for it ever since. They have a special lunch deal where you can one of the popular mains for about half price at \u00a36 or you can have 2 beers with you main for \u00a310. Otherwise mains will set you back around \u00a39-13 excluding service charge pocket change for the orgasmic taste you will be rewarding your stomach with. 5/5, I'd give it 6/5 if i could.",

When you finally sit down, by which point you are so famished you feverishly devour a bowl of salty tortilla chips. The menu is strangely repetitive, and the variations between tacos and tortillas come out looking exactly the same. The refried beans looks like something you would find in a joke shop, and probably tastes the same. The rice is also refried. The beef 'tacos' I had were also greasy, and incredibly salty. My friend who had the chilli con carne was very reminiscent of a Bombay Badboy from the Pot Noodle range.

Apart from the accents of the servers and the strange white sauce on my enchildas suizas, this was pretty damn good Tex Mex, in Covent Garden, of all places!",

The waiters are great at explaining dishes, helping you choose, and are so accomodating if you want to make slight changes. Went there for a meal with a friend who had just got engaged and arranged with the waitress to bring over champagne as a surprise, and open it as the friend arrived, which she did with perfect timing, and joined in the congratulations, which was so lovely and friendly. I keep returning to Cafe Pacifico - both for the lovely food and the fantastic cocktails. Ok, it's not cheap, admittedly, but you won't go wrong for a fantastic night out in London.",
