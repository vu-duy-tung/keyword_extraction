    "text": "Today my plan was originally to try the burger you could get at the newly opened Boxpark in Shoreditch. After reading that the burgers there are perhaps not too good, I decided to change my plans. Boxpark will be around for some time, so I can still try that burger another day. But today, without particular reason, I simply wanted to have a properly good burger. Once again, I checked out young&foodish's Top 10 list at youngandfoodish.com/lond\u2026 \u00a0and decided to try the current #6 \u00a0Joe Allen. After having a coffee at Notes Covent Garden (qype.co.uk/place/2153720\u2026 ) I walked down to Joe Allen. From the outside, it looks like nothing special. After opening the door, you have to climb down some stairs, and end up in a dark-ish but nice restaurant. I ordered a sparkling rose and the cheese and bacon burger with fries (yes, as other people already pointed out: the burger is not on the menu, but they're happy to serve it anyway :). An excellent choice, I would say. The burger is not as small as I expected after reading some reviews. For me, it was definitely big enough, and the handcut chips with skin were also delicious. The burger is very simple: a thick patty, melted cheese on top of it, and two strips of grilled bacon on top of that. And all in a tasty bun, that's perfectly sized for this burger. That's a burger how I like a burger to be. No green or saucy distractions. ;) Really a burger I can recommend! It's also not really expensive. After the burger I needed an espresso, so that's what I ordered. I got an illy-branded cup with an okay-tasting espresso \u00a0but what I missed was a glass of water. Perhaps I'm wrong, but at a serious restaurant, I expect a glass of water with an espresso. Anyway, the food was good, I also liked the atmosphere, it was light enough to read while I waited for the burger and the espresso. It was not very busy, as I was there on a late Sunday afternoon \u00a0not the busiest time for any restaurant. Definitely a restaurant I should visit again! And then I will order some water, if I choose to have a espresso ;)",

The night was standard Joe Allen affair. Lots of atmosphere, good food, and friendly staff. It seems to be the place to go when you have friends from out of town. It has something for everyone on the menu - in fact they don't even put hambugers on it (something you would expect from an Amercian diner), but you can get them if you ask. Certainly worth visiting.",

On Sunday and Monday nights they have a \u00a320 menu that gives you three courses, half a carafe of wine or some champagne and water! You can't beat that for value. I didn't opt for that on my last visit. I had something off the menu but should be tried and that was their burger. \u00a310, and you get some beautiful beef with cheese or bacon or both. I just had cheese and it comes in a beautifully toasted brioche bun. I had some chips with mine but my restaurant fella had a jacket potato and sour cream. The meat just melted in the mouth and I wanted more, even though they had a massive hunk of cow in my bun. We had come Caesar salad as a side and that was perfection. Given I had quite a simple meal I feel I should go back and try more of the menu on the basis of research. It is highly worth paying a visit to.",

After watching Equus on the West end we were off to Convent Garden area for a late supper at Joe Allen's. I had the lamb chops which were fabulous nd my GF had the pan fried, corn fed chicken with mash. Services was a bit slow, but then again so were we, so that was no real bother--except when it comes to cocktails of course. Joe Allen's is a good place to dine after a show. Very chill atmosphere--be on your toes to find the entrance--meaning: save the drinking for after you find your way inside.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to eat at this restaurant for ages and as if by magic, Seb surprised me with an invitation to come dine with him there.The restaurant entrance was so discreet that we very nearly missed it, but literally as soon as we followed the winding stairwell down to the very cosy basement, I knew we were onto a winner. The brick walls were covered with a splatter of various West End posters and the dining area was arranged in cosy twos and larger tables, stretching to the back of the dining room, where an open hatch gave us a direct view into the kitchen.Our waitress was friendly and attentive, taking our order promptly. \u00a0While we waited, she despatched a bread basket, which included some beautiful rosemary rolls.Then my main arrived. \u00a0It was delicious. \u00a0Starting with a tiny pot of coleslaw that I was expecting to be an overly sweet afterthought. \u00a0It turned out to be the correct balance of carrot and cabbage, covered in a dressing just the right side acidity and sweetness, nicely seasoned.The grilled chicken was perfectly charred, moist and juicy inside and not overpowered by its spices. And the ribs....OMG ! \u00a0 A cheeky, dripping festival of sweet sticky ribs, so perfectly cooked that cutting through them, was as easy as butter. \u00a0The accompanying rice was lovely and just enough to mop up the ribs gravy. \u00a0Just one bugbear (but then again isn't there always ?) the cornbread which I was really looking forward to was unfortunately, an uninspiring heavy polenta/cornmeal mixture that was dense in texture and tasted incredibly bland. Cornbread is only ever the real mcCoy when it actually contains real corn, is moist inside and perfectly baked. The Joe Allen vibe is undeniably cosy and intimate enough to make you feel right at home. Its patrons are diverse - from ladies that lunch to families and tourists. \u00a0Also there's the theatre darlings, represented at our sitting, by comedy legend Jackie Mason who shuffled through the dinning room looked incredibly small and very, very \u00a0grumpy. Cheer up Jackie \u00a0! \u00a0It may never happen if it has already, at least you had another great meal at Joe Allen !",

    "text": "NB - the four stars is for the burger, the rest of the food would be lucky to scrape a two...Descend down the dark staircase into the basement space, bare brick walls covered in West End folio posters from shows currently on and those that are 30 year old. It's comfortable, clubby and always busy. Grab a drink at the long bar and listen to Jimmy the pianist hit a range of showtune standards on late week nights. The menu is a dogs dinner of vague Americana and 70's oddities. It's hardly a thing of beauty, but guests can chose from a mash-up ranging from Caesar Salad, Chilli Con Carne and cornbread through to 70's relics such as chicken with orange sauce. The best advice I can give you is not to follow suit. The portions might be large, it's an American restaurant after all, but what I've sampled over the years has struggled to raise the bar beyond the pedestrian at best, and can be sub-TGI Fridays at it's worst.Go for the burger. And only the burger. It's not on the menu, but don't feel bashful, everyone knows about it these days. It's a thick charred bombe of a patty served medium rare as standard housed within the soft sweet cathedral of a brioche bun. Good crispy bacon and melted (cheddar) cheese are a worthy accompaniment, as are the spears of gherkin served on the side. Add skin on fries, occasionally over salted but generally as good as these things can be, and serve with a side of salacious gossip, preferably about who's doing who in the current show you're working on.",

    "text": "I love the New York version of this place and have now been to the London branch three times. Each time it has found a new way to just not be quite right. My sister and I came here for some supper before going to the theatre round the corner. We weren't overly hungry and the mains looked just too substantial, so we opted to have a starter and a salad each. I had the scallops with mushrooms, my sister had the mozzarella and tomato, then we both had the caesar salad. The scallops and mozzarella were amazing, The mushrooms that came with my starter were fantastic, the scallops were tiny, and packed with flavour. Much nicer than large fatty ones. The caesar salad was unfortunately dunked in dressing, and I know, I should remember to ask them to go light or put it on the side, but I forgot and didn't like it too much. The lettuce was very crisp though! We had the chocolate brownie to share for a pudding. It wasn't hot, and didn't come with ice cream!! (We had to ask for it). What looses points for me was the odd service. It wasn't bad, just really fragmented (we were served by about 5 different people, all who seemingly did not speak to each other). Also, one waitress stood at the end of the bar tapping out her own personal song on a glass with a spoon. That's just obnoxious!What really pissed me off was the extra 2.50 for a very small dollop of ice cream, when the waitress had said it would be comped. bad bad bad.",

Hundreds of posters on the wall, a bar that looked liked it had been stolen from the set of Cheers (i know the bar was from Boston, same sort of thing thou) and a very warm greeting from the front of house manager, so we were showed to our seats, where all the Burgers Monday enthusiasts were seated. \u00a0So like every Burger Monday you knew what you were getting, so we started with a buffalo wing slider, and man was it good, bun was slightly toasted, the chicken juicy and tender, and the hot sauce, nice and tangy, also got a apple slaw which gave the dish a different texture, so I was well happy to get off to a flyer, next up was the main event, \u00a0The Bacon Cheese Burger, you had the pickles and onion on the side so you could add if you wanted, which i did, and we got two big bowls of fries which we shared as a table, i took a massive bear like bite out of the burger, it was good, the crunch of the onion mixed well with the gooey cheddar and the smokey bacon, then the final hit was the burger, it tasted good, the only gripe i have, was the dryness of it, not enough juice, but hey, it was still a tasty burger, so overall i had fun, meet some cool people and had a laugh, and i'd like to come back to sample some of the other food.So why not try a proper New York style burger, it's well worth a punt.",

Instead I had a chicken salad the like of which I haven't had since the dark days of the 80s, when London restaurants were a joke. Utterly vile. Couldn't tell which elements were chicken and which were potato. Horrible dressing. Our dishes sat waiting on the kitchen counter for a waitress for 15 minutes. But the chicken in the salad certainly hadn't been cooked that day, so it wasn't in a hurry It had died in vain. My dining companion ordered a second glass of cranberry juice without ice this time please. The second juice arrived in a far smaller glass to compensate for the padding that the ice offered in the original. They really have their eye on the bottom line here. London is absolutely jammed full of great pre/post theatre dining options. This is a pathetic anachronism. Someone should put it out of its misery.Oh, and it was also \u00a356 for two salads, a glass of red wine, a fizzy water and two cranberry juices.",

Menu changes quite a lot so theres always something there that is tempting. Burgers are excellent as are the salads. Don't forget when you go down there, those what work in the theatre business are sat on one side of the room and \"civilians\" get plonked on the other.. And there is a hallowed \"best table\" so its always interesting to see who is there.",

    "text": "I came to Joe Allen for the first time with a large group of family after my College Graduation, and was extremely pleased with their food. I recently went back to visit London and came to Joe Allen with a group of 4 girls, all young (in our 20's). I ordered the bar steak, along with 2 of the others, one ordered the ribs and the last girl ordered the chicken wigs as a meal. We also got 3 orders of the Mac n Cheese off the Hor's doeuvers menu. All together we were very satisfied with the food. The steaks were relatively good for the price we paid, and were cooked to our specifications. My friend so ordered the ribs was more than satisfied, and ate everything on her plate. The chicken wings could have been better, we had assumed they would be with buffalo sauce, but they were actually in a sweet teriyaki-like sauce. And let's just say none of the mac n cheese went to waste! The service was lacking. We had to call our server over to order our initial drinks, to order dessert and again to ask for the check. The restaurant was busy when we first arrived, and understandably so, our water had multiple tables, but by the end of the night both times we had to flag him down he was chatting with other employees and just not paying attention. Overall the food was fantastic, and the restaurant was not overly crowded and had a good atmosphere. The \"prohibition era\" Chicago theme they have going on in the restaurant was very charming touch as well! It made us feel like we'd gone back in time.",

Fine, not amaaaaahzing?Totally a-ok, nothing disastrous, but definitely nothing stand-out either.Although it's not technically a basement, this location of Joe Allen sure feels like it...it's intentionally dark and, even showing up for brunch on a Sunday, means that I lose track of time easily. Which maybe is appropriate...the whole place feels kind of in a time warp: The decor is old-school (or American tavern-y? I don't know, help me out here, guys). The woman tapping happily away at the piano very well might have been perched on that very bench since 1970s. The menu lacks innovative options (caesar salad, burger, pork chop, salmon pate, lemon cake were all tested at our table) which, though comforting, doesn't push Joe Allen to the top of any 'repeat eat' lists for me.That's not to say that Joe Allen doesn't have some appeal: it is bustling with good buzz from a mixed clientele (guess: many theatre/opera-goers). Servers are really responsive, but also don't rush the table. The bathrooms are clean*. So yep, as I led with: good, not great.*When I have to defer to bathroom cleanliness as a pro, however, I feel like the review has already kinda sorta lost itYelp note: I think the price-points aren't great for the a la carte, so prix fixe is the way to go (IF you go).",

We were seated at a single round table right in the entrance, meaning people kept whizzing by our table bumping into our chairs and generally it was just traffic jam central. This place tries to pack way too many tables into such a small narrow restaurant. The lighting secondly is atrocious. I couldn't even read the menu it was so dark and dank in there. Let alone take a good looking photo without another phone as a secondary light source. Staff were pleasant enough, but how many times should you have to ask for water and cutlery? Why is cutlery not brought out to the table before all the food? When the food arrives, it would be nice to check if everyone is okay with their food and/or lack of cutlery. I literally had to walk to the bar in order to get an extra fork after asking twice for it to be brought to the table.The food itself isn't bad, but isn't great either. Plus you can't see it. I'm somebody that definitely believes you eat and taste food with all your senses. The inability to see the colours in my food and whether said food is cooked/undercooked definitely is a negative. In all expensive for what you get and service is very miss.",

I love when they're home made and the one here is a beany-chickpea hybrid that had the taste of falafel but none of the dryness. Magic!

I went to there with a group of friends but one of them arrived nearly an hour later due to traffic, the restaurant team was very understanding. They didn't rush us at anytime through our meal which was quite enjoyable. While we were waiting we had the homemade tortilla chips with guacamole and our first bottle of wine. Three of us ordered a lemon & rosemary chicken, a sirloin steak, and Joe's spiced baby back ribs. The rest of us opted for the famous 'secret' burger which is not listed on the menu. The burger was a classic cheeseburger but well executed. The beef was tasty and juicy. I had mine with bacon and cheese and requested shoestring fries to come with it. I also tried my boyfriend's main (baby back ribs), they were tender and delicious with a very nice smokey taste.None of us took desserts as we were all pretty full after our drinks and main dishes.Overall I really enjoyed my evening at Joe Allen, the atmosphere was great with live piano playing in the background. It was the perfect place to a catch up with a group of friends with tasty classic dishes and nice wine.",

    "text": "Epic burger fail! Intrigued by the great experience Dan H has with the BurgerMonday event hosted by Young & Foodish at Joe Allen, I added it to my burger shortlist. And when the Champagne & Fromage Elite event was right around the corner, this seemed like a perfect time to give it a go.I ducked out of work early, sped over to Covent Garden, and within 15 minutes I was the proud owner of a brand spanking new bacon cheeseburger from Joe Allen. The sun was shining on a convenient spot in Covent Garden market with some pretty decent live music and the friendly hostess had thrown in a quarter full bottle of Heniz ketchup to go with the fries. Life was good. Well until the first bit at least.To be far, the bun is decent and the cheese tasty. Overall, it's a tad on the small size but filling enough especially with the large portions of fries. But it's when you get to the meat that it all goes to hell in the breadbasket. First off, the patty is about 2 inches think and about that in diameter so rather than the typical burger shape you get a cylindrical lump of meat. And it's dense. How dense is it? Well it's denser than your stereotypical line backer after a 3 day bender. It's so dense that I didn't bite into it so much as gnaw away at the edges. And as Dan H has mentioned, it's dry. And given I had ordered it medium rare (to avoid just that) and it was very pink, that's a damn impressive feat of cooking.The fries were alright but nothing special. They are medium-thick cut with moderately fluffy insides but severely lacking in crunch factor. On the plus side, the interior d\u00e9cor is pretty cool and the hostess was uber friendly and helpful. In fact, I liked almost everything (well prices were a tad high for the quality but not for the location) except the burger patty. And since that's what I specifically came for it was a bit of a letdown. I can't say I won't ever return, but it's definitely not going to be high on my list. Given you have a Byron and even MEATMarket just around the corner, Joe Allen's will need to up the stakes in the burger department if it wants to compete.",

And the verdict is....meh it's just OK and a bit small, hence the 3 star rating.Interestingly enough the burger is not on a menu and you have to \"secretly\" ask for it. However it can't be too much of a secret as I saw many a table dining with said burger. The meat itself was well cooked and clearly higher-quality chuck. The bacon was a bit undercooked and its smokiness actually overpowered the burger and its brioche bun.The buffalo wings as a starter are delicious---I'd definitley get them again, though be forewarned they are covered in a tangy sweet bbq sauce instead of your traditional tabasco laced sauce (see pics).As for the atmosphere, the other reviewers are spot on, Joe Allen is an interesting exposed brick space below the streets of Covent Garden. Has the atmosphere of a higher-end American family-style restaurant, almost like a fancy candle lit TGIFridays---though that sounds a bit harsh, Joe Allen is actually nicer than that. \u00a0All in, Joe Allen is a solid but not spectacular 3 star place for American fare in Covent Garden.",

It has an air of exclusivity, it isn't (but early booking is advised). Our party was probably one of half a dozen celebrating that night and said surly pianist threw a comedy strop and slammed down his piano lid when the evening began drawing to its rowdy crescendo and this was as early as the parsnip bisque starter arriving \u00a0I could't quite tell what the menu was about; goats cheese salad, burger or steak? Not that fancy at all. The Christmas menu wasn't either. My pulled pork and duck terrine, served with a side of cranberry ketchup, looked more like a tipped out tin of Sheba and although I am not the queen of- \u00a0I was expecting something a little finer. From the Christmas menu, I then chose the mackerel which was disappointing to say the least, not unlike supermarket vacuum packed mackerel I'd have for a quick mid-week dinner, it was fried and unpleasantly super fishy tasting and I have my suspicions that the potatoes on the side may have been tinned as they were unpleasantly briny and tasted of a tin. A cheese course for sweet also came, bizarrely, with a toasted currant bun. My dining companions going for the turkey were also left unimpressed with this star dish's best impression of a single serve mum's gone to Iceland microwave meal. Did Joe Allen's have the X Factor, no but nevertheless we thought we saw Sue Pollard several times so drinking games were successful. A pleasant evening was had by all and the service staff were exemplary, truly in the sprit of things, however the food was not a showstopper.",

    "text": "Dinner at Joe Allen, a little 'secret' downstairs spot on a Friday night. Casablanca playing on the TV, movie star photos on all the walls, you get the feeling that you could be off-Broadway somewhere in New York. Being particular, I wanted the cheese plate as a starter. They graciously agreed. Though I felt the walnut raisin bread was just too sweet and overpowered the delicate cheeses. Of course I had to order the 'secret' burger, and my companions followed suit. \u00a0It was okay. Since the burger revolution hit London, our expectations stepped up a bit but this was pretty alright. A small but really thick patty, I ordered mine with bacon and cheese. Very tasty and left me feeling SO FULL! The highlight for me was dessert: sour cream, pear and caramel pie. Just amazing.",

Steaks, grills and salads, appetisers and market fish etc. If you are a fan of burgers ask for a Secret Burger - it's not on the menu -- and you will be surprisingly shocked -- it is AMAZING!!!The brick work walls are adorned with posters of classic musical and stage productions, famous American stars and the odd sporting icon.Great place for food and drinks!",

Fish and vegetables arrived, I was shocked, was the smallest portion I've ever seen, it was like 3 fork fulls. I almost wanted to laugh at how anyone could think a grown ass man could eat this as a mains.. Ate then left and had to look for more food.. Won't ever go back!",
