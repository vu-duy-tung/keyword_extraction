    "text": "I'm slightly ashamed to admit that I've eaten at Nando's twice today. It's not something I make a habit of, I hasten to add - before today I had not set foot in a Nando's restaurant for several years, but it just so happened that a work party headed to the Richmond branch for lunch today, and the Clink Street branch was the closest food outlet for a munchies emergency during a drinking session in the Anchor this evening. It's the truth, your honour, I swear, and all dieting intentions will be resumed as of tomorrow Mind you, visiting two outlets on one day is pretty good for comparison purposes. The Richmond branch at lunchtime was busy, slow on food, and the chip machine was 'broken'. By contrast, although the Clink Street branch was just as busy this evening, with several groups waiting for tables, the food service was quick and efficient, and much tastier than at lunch time - though I am sure this is in no way related to the volume of wine consumed. The setting in Clink Street is also much more impressive: the Richmod branch is something akin to a grubby shed, lined with faded beams and tatty tables; but the Clink Street venue is under the railway bridge, giving it high vaulted brick ceilings and a totally different feel. Definitely recommended for snack attacks during drinking!",

Well, because I'm from the US and I live near a town called Newark that has TONS of similar establishments to Nandos, that are much more authentic. When I hear Portuguese roast chicken I think of juicy, fall off the bone goodness. Nandos? It was definitely fall off the bone and juicy, but was seriously lacking in flavor. I tried the mango something one and didn't taste any seasoning at all, simply tasted like chicken. I had to douse my chicken in their Peri Peri sauce, which i will praise. It is garlicky and spicy. Not the spicy that hits you right away, but definitely does after a few bites. Very yummy and wanted to steal a bottle of it ha. The two sides that I got were chips and rice. The chips weren't crispy :( I like them crispy, but were tasty with the Periperi sauce. I could probably eat everything with that peri peri sauce!! Rice was OK... nothing special. Overall, it was a decent dinner, but it didn't live up to the authentic Portuguese roast chicken I've had in Newark, NJ.",

    "text": "Chicken time! If you like chicken, odds are good you've been to Nando's at some point. One of the better imports from South Africa and inspired by the Portuguese, Nando's is a prime choice when you want a cheap and cheerful meal that's somewhat healthy (compared to KFC) and fairly quick. But odds are good you knew that so let's get into specifics.This particular Nando's is very spacious and during the week you are likely to be seated immediately or at worst wait a few minutes. Weekends are a bit trickier and I've been told of waits up to 30 minutes (which isn't too bad for a restaurant, but for Nando's is an eternity!). With the high turnover, you are almost guaranteed freshly grilled meats, crisp and crunchy chips, and corn on the cob that's bursting with flavour (and thankfully not butter). Foodwise, the chicken is just like every other Nando's (gotta love franchise standardisation). Most times, they get it right with flavour filled skin and tender moist chicken. However, there are those occasions where the chicken comes out dry and no amount of sauce will help. With this particular one, I'd say they get it right 4 times out of 5 which is a pretty good ratio.Make sure you get your sauces as soon as possible. Given the high ratio of eaters to sauce bottles and the tendency of people to grab every sauce they might want, there have been occasions here where no sauce could be found and you had to go table to table hoping to strike it lucky and borrow a bottle. Not much fun when all you want to do is dive into your food.Wine and beer are available at more than reasonable prices (a glass of red wine costs \u00a32.10 for example) so easily a place to get your drink on while you eat. It makes Nando's a great pre-night out spot. This location has plenty of table staff so you can wave one over for another drink instead of trekking out and waiting 15 mins in line again.The front door is a bit tricky when it's cold out as the heat from the grills just inside create a high pressure area that takes a bit of elbow grease to barge through. It does provide entertainment while waiting in line though so overall a plus point. The lines tend to be a bit long so expect to wait 10-15 minutes to place your order.Overall, definitely the best Nando's for groups that I've been in and something to keep in mind anytime you're out near LB.",

It's huge, I like the arches feel and it's right on the river.Being on the river might just be it's downfall though - as I'm sure it attracts hella lot of tourists, which traditionally means surly, tired staff.

I love this particular branch of the chain though because it's designed to fit in with the surrounding buildings, using arches and bare brick work like in the clink beside it. The food is always good here, last time I went with my friend we both got a chicken burger with fries and she got a corn on the cob as well. The corn was a little dry but everything else was delicious. What makes Nandos unique is that they can serve restaurant quality Portuguese food at below restaurant level prices because they have eliminated waiter service, making it a kind of gourmet fast food restaurant. You're seated when you arrive, then you go to the counter to order your food, and they deliver it to your table once it's cooked. You also help yourself to drinks and cutlery. It costs \u00a35.80 for a chicken fillet with fries, and a side order of corn was \u00a31.70. Unlimited drinks cost \u00a31.90 which is brilliant as I usually order a few cokes at dinner. If helping yourself to drinks and forks means getting such delicious food for this price I hope the good word will spread to all the overpriced restaurants in town!",

As I said to Laura N last night, sometimes a vicious Yelping just doesn't do it. So this particular experience will end up in one of my infamous customer service complaint letters. After being denied tapas, a bunch of relatively sober Yelpers toddled along to Nando's, skipping with glee as we imagined chicken from drawers and halloumi goodness. But the manager behind the counter snidely told us it was take out only and we had 5 minutes to order. Sigh! Okay we all lined up to order and quickly realised this lady was in a baaad mood. She rebuked all of us in some way or another, snapped and bitchily took our orders. Thinking it was just me and Ciaran R, I asked the rest what they thought and ruuuude was the answer. It was to get worse though. I ordered fro-yo and got a big cup to fill from the machine, which I thought switched off automatically... Err no it didn't, my bad! So when Laura N went up to order her fro-yo, she was denied by the lady because 'your friend left the machine on' (oops). She followed it up by 'but you can pay, I'll give you a cup and you can scrap off what's left on the drip tray ... (!!) Yeah I effed up, but there was no instructions on the machine and no staff to help. Even so, this kind of attitude is totally unacceptable. Regardless of the time you enter, 2pm or 11pm, you should be treated with the same courtesy and respect. This Nando's gets two stars though because the building is beautiful and the only problem with the place was her. She needs to be reminded that the unemployment rate is hitting record high numbers.",

It's just wrong.For starters, this place is HUUUUGE. We are talking super high ceilings, gorgeous exposed brick walls, views of the water and a layout large enough to house a circus! But all of this for chicken? Clearly the chain must be doing well, but I shudder to imagine how much the rent must cost here.As for the food, it's chainy. I ordered the 6 lil' chicken wings and with spicy rice and garlic toast and they were tasty enough, but after just coming back from Portugal and eating my own weight in delicious authentic fare, this definitely tasted like a chain to me. Also, with this location soooo close to the market up the way with a wide array of tasty nibblies to choose from, I say, go local and ditch the chain.",

When I finally got to the front and began my monologue the chap at the till got a call on his mobile phone and vanished off the face of the earth.

    "text": "This is by far my favourite Nando's. \u00a0It sits perfectly within its surroundings, working around the impressive arches and vaults, making it a rather spectacular venue for a fast-food restaurant. \u00a0There are large tables throughout the spacious interior and the service is as quick as it should be in a Nando's. \u00a0As you might already know, Nando's specializes in selling chicken. \u00a0Best on the menu is the grilled chicken which can be spiced to your liking. \u00a0Funnily enough, last time I was here we ordered a half spiced, half lemon-zest whole chicken, so they do leave you the opportunity to personalize your meals and have a taste of both. \u00a0Even though most of the people I know adore Nando's, I still can't help but feel that the food is a bit dry at times, but their famous Peri Peri always does wonders to make this better. \u00a0I also do quite enjoy the Nando's routine of having control over drink refills, sauces, plates and cutlery.This is the perfect place to venture when feeling peckish after a stroll down the beautiful London Southbank.",

    "text": "I once wrote a review of Nando's for Londonist \u00a0and got summarily reamed by readers commenting on how I should have been reviewing less ubiquitous eateries. Those folks had a point, but I'll stand by my review. Nando's is good. I love digging into a plate of their wings dosed with extra hot sauce. And if we must live in a corporate-oriented world of chain restaurants, I'll take Nando's grilled chicken over the multitude of greasier options any day. It appears as though plenty of people agree with me as well. Despite the onslaught of incredulous responses to my Londonist review, I've yet to meet anyone who didn't like the place - I've even had a vegetarian friend recommend it to me (apparently, Nando's few veggie items are better than those at a multitude of greasier options). Nando's seems to be a happy medium. I particularly like their Southwark location. It's massive and in a rather lovely setting, nuzzled underneath Southwark Bridge. The tables are huge and seats are cushy. Of course, its South Bank address means it can get crowded and overrun with tourists. Nothing against tourists (I like seeing the Tate Modern et al too) but with Nando's find-your-seat-before-you-order routine, it can get a bit chaotic.",

    "text": "This Nando's branch is great. I usually go to the one in Elephant and Castle, but once you've eaten here you kinda always want to eat here because the interior is really quite lovely. Chicken is the order of the day, available in various sauces including lemon & herb, mango & lime, medium peri peri, hot peri peri and then extra hot peri peri sauce. There are a variety of side dishes too, including cole slaw, spicy rice, chips, sweet potato mash, salad and corn on the cob. The sweet potato mash is very buttery and the texture is quite gloopy which I didn't like, and the mango and lime sauce on the chicken is probably best left unordered. The coleslaw is very nice though and well you can't go wrong with chips. Good sized portions for the kids meals too (must be under 12 years old), and depending on the flavour of frozen yoghurt (strawberry is nice), it may or may not be worth getting.",

I loved the food and seasoning they had. I wish they have this in United States but this one was the best chicken I ever had with this seasoning. I love my meat bone in so I ordered 1/4 chicken level hotGarlic bread on side Peri peri chips on sideBut later server informed that bone-in chicken is sold out and they can instead give chicken breast or thigh with same preparations. I was little disappointed but I asked them to replace it with chicken thigh. It was so tasty!!!I also had extra hot sauce and garlic sauce on the side. The food is delicious and if you love to eat then it's must try place. I will go one of these days to try that bone in one but yeah all 5 stars are for food!!",

Twice we had to have multiple people look into our meal. Once the meal arrived it was hot and tasty. Coming from the states it's more like a El Pollo loco with a restaurant style theme. It's in a very crowded and touristy area and I'm not sure if that's the reason it's busy. I enjoyed the food because it was fresh and tasty the service was lacking and that's why the 4 stars.",

But when Nathan announced a Yelper Takeover to educate the masses on how to Nando, I was intrigued. Maybe I'd been doing it all wrong, maybe that's why I don't like Nandos. Time to give it another chance. So there I was, a bunch of people explaining to me how to order and what to combine. I went with a few suggestions and hoped for the best. When the food arrived I was once again very underwhelmed. Even the double chicken portion ended up just being one small piece of dried out chicken, barely lukewarm. The sides were really tasty (I had coleslaw and corn on the cob, both were good) and if that's all I'd had, I'd probably give a much higher rating. But since Nandos is all about the chicken and the chicken just isn't very good, I can't in good conscience give a better rating. So there you have it, I really tried, I really wanted to like Nandos. But I don't. :/",

I got the chicken burger and it was quite delicious. Although, it was kind of small for what I was paying for. The sauce was definitely the best part of the sandwich. My table also got the unlimited frozen yogurt as dessert so we were grubbing on that afterwards. All my friends from the states wish Nando is in the US, too!",

    "text": "So, I've come to realize, I wanted to actually support local places, but most of the local places don't accept credit cards, and being foreign, my go to is the credit card. \u00a0So, we end up at chains, half of the time not knowing it, until I get home and can read over other reviewers to realize it is in fact a chain. \u00a0On my original search, we were cold and hungry, and saw chicken wings within a 3 minute walk, that was enough for me. \u00a0It wasn't until we got inside, that I saw the Portuguese part too. \u00a0I honestly, had never had Portuguese food and after eating the food, maybe I still have not. \u00a0Don't get me wrong the food itself was fine, but think rotisserie chicken, if you want to stretch it, cuban. \u00a0We got a whole chicken, and it was fine, but nothing special, I couldn't find at the local supermarket. \u00a0However, the sauces, were pretty darn tasty. \u00a0While, we awaited our chicken, we got to try ALL of the sauces on a separate plate. \u00a0We really enjoyed the garlic and the yellow pepper, both non spicy, but we actually enjoyed their highest level X and mixed in with both for flavor and kick. \u00a0As far as the sides, I totally forgot that \"chips\" were UK's version of fries, if I would have remembered, I would have just totally ignored that option, we did enjoy the garlic bread and the spicy rice, even though it was not spicy at all, the corn on the cob was so bland and not even placed on the grill long enough. \u00a0So overall, the food is 3 stars at best, the price point though was very reasonable for the amount of food we got, way better than our previous meal.But why 4 stars? The space it is in. \u00a0It is gorgeous, one of the nicest restaurants, I have ever stepped foot in. \u00a0The space itself is 5 stars and worth stopping and taking a picture of.",

Then you head over to the fountain drink machine, where you are surprised by the wide array of sauces available next to the drinks. The sauces include Piri Piri-spiced sauces ranging from mild to XXX-hot. Also included are sauces such as lemon pepper and a garlic sauce. After grabbing your drink, you sit down and wait in agony to experience your chicken experience. Try not to look at nor smell other tables being served their own servings. I recommend whetting your appetite and/or washing down your chicken with a nice ale. We went for the chicken roulette: Rather than being chicken arranged in a roulette-like circular shape, all 10 pieces of chicken are haphazardly stacked in a glorious pile of chicken basted in sauces of various heat. A person of high heat tolerance may not find any of them truly intense on their own; each piece was delicious and flavorful in its own way and you can discern that each piece was individually basted. After you finish your dish, the next step is simply deciding whether you want to leave, or order more.The choice is up to you, my friend. 5 stars, rounded up from 4.5.",

Occasion 2: I am at Silverburn shopping centre by myself. \u00a0Decide to pop in to Nandos. \u00a0Briefly look at menu, clock people reeling off orders to the cashier at the front like the way people do in a Starbucks (the chicken equivalent of an extra shot, extra hot, double macchiato venti soy vanilla latte cappuccino) and I got intimidated and flustered, and went to Subway instead. Occasion 3: I am again in Silverburn. \u00a0I arrange to meet a friend at the Nandos for dinner. \u00a0She arrives and decided she'd like something more restaurantey/less fast foodey and we go to the tapas place instead. Gah! \u00a0There comes a point where it's just gone too long, it's become a habit and I figured I was just going to have to add 'been to Nando's' to my NeverHaveIEver list, along with 'watched a Bond film' and 'been to CenterParcs'. \u00a0I don't know how to Nando! \u00a0(Yes, 'to Nando' is a verb....you Nando, he Nandos, they Nando.....its just that until now, I didn't Nando). \u00a0 So imagine my delight when elite Yelper Nate organised a trip to Nando's to educate the uninitiated! \u00a0This is just what I needed! \u00a0I arrived a little late after getting a bit lost along the cobbled lanes around London Bridge, but the Nando's way of doing things meant that this wasn't a problem. \u00a0Nate and others kindly talked me through the menu options and a soon realised there was no need for me to have been flustered by my first encounter with the menu. \u00a0They explained that you first of all pick your heat/spiciness level, but pro tip: recommend going for one of the flavours instead (lemon herb or mango \u00a0lime), and add heat/spice to taste from the array of bottled chili sauces available to collect and take to your table while you await your food. \u00a0Then you pick your chicken and then your sides. \u00a0There were lots of pitta/sandwich type options available but for my first visit I decided to keep it simple with some straightforward lemon and herb chicken thighs with sides of macho peas and spicy rice. \u00a0I always go for thighs over other bits of the chicken because the meat is so juicy and flavourful, and harder to mess up/dry out. \u00a0I needn't have worried, though - the chicken thighs were deliciously juicy with crisped skin and delicious smoky barbecue flavours from the open grill. \u00a0Yum yum yum. \u00a0The thighs were already de-boned too, so no faffing about eating around the awkward bones. \u00a0My plate came with 2 small dishes with my sides on. \u00a0The macho peas were a cross between mushy peas and garden peas, and had some sort of peri peri spice to them I think but that got a little bit lost amongst all the other flavours I had going on on my plate (I had all the sauces out). \u00a0I would perhaps pick a different side next time because once the spice flavour is lost, it was just a small portion of peas really. \u00a0The spicy rice was nice, although again the spice was lost so it was just 'rice'. \u00a0I would perhaps go for the mash or wedges and some salad next time I think. \u00a0 Anyway, back to the ordering which had got me so flustered before. \u00a0It really is easy. \u00a0Pick your heat, pick your chicken, pick your sides, go to the till and tell the server your table number and your order, pay your money, go back to your table and wait for your food to arrive. \u00a0Simples. My food arrived very quickly and was very tasty. \u00a0For 4 chicken thighs, 2 sides and a large glass of red wine, it was 15 quid and you can't really say fairer than that. It's not fancy dining, but it is good, basic and relatively healthy food, cooked well. \u00a0Given that BBQ'd chicken is one of my favourite meals, and given that I have now popped my Nandos cherry and know how to Nando, I will definitely be back again soon Many thanks to Nate for organising.",

    "text": "The location and venue is really beautiful. It's built around the old archways along the Thames. On entering we were seated within 20 minutes. We went up and ordered pretty swiftly seeing as though we knew what we wanted. I like that they have a basin for you to wash your hands. We collected our sauces and were sat waiting for our food when a waitress came along and without asking, just took our sauce bottles away. I thought this strange especially seeing as though there were plenty of bottles available if people wanted them. Perhaps she thought we looked full and like we had already eaten but even so, perhaps one should ask when one starts clearing the table. 15 minutes after ordering the couple next to us receives half of their food order. When they question it they get told it'll be along in a minute. Anyway back to our table it's now 20 minutes later and we receive our luke warm food!! Thankfully the sauces are amazing and can save just about any meal!!! So we slather it on and begin eating. No one came back to check if our food was ok! Back to the couple at the table next to us. By now they're wondering what's really up with their meal, so they ask. The waiter looks at their receipt and matter of factly tells them that only one plate of food got ordered. They don't get offered anything in way of compensation for the mess up, not even an apology that I could hear. The tables are so close you are practically having dinner with them, or not as in this case!! This place may have location on its side but oh boy, it really hasn't mastered the art of customer service!!",

    "text": "We don't have Nando's in the US (there's allegedly one in DC, but until I see it, I'm skeptical). Now there's a few factors as to why I'm a huge fan of Nando's having only been here twice in my life (in the past two days since arriving in London): - I'm Portuguese - this food is like Crack to me - My Aussie buddy raved about Nando's when I met him and I've been looking forward to trying one - The exceptional chicken, rice, sauce combo, with some corn and garlic bread thrown in is a meal I subsist on every day. Love the sauceHonestly, I wanted to give this place 4 stars but my wife insisted on 5. Given she'd give up a meal at Alain Ducasse to eat here, I deferred to her preference.Quick thoughts on the other reviews: - Comparing this place to KFC is like me comparing Man U to the Colorado Rapids - Complaining about this place being a chain or shuddering at the rent cost seems idiotic",
